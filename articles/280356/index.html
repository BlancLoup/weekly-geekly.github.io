It is interesting because it was made not because marketers said ‚Äúusers need a new nettop‚Äù.  aBeing One appeared as an iron tool for working with the ‚ÄúInternet of things‚Äù, for which Acer provides its cloud with the SDK and API. <br><br> <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/acer/blog/280356/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c18/168/a4c/c18168a4cb537db12eacce6a32c4e77d.jpg"></a> <br><br>  Accordingly, Acer offers not only the aBeing One computer, but also the Acer Open Platform, a platform for processing data and managing any ‚Äúsmart‚Äù devices. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  What's inside? </h2><br>  ABeing One (the <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/acer/blog/262904/">review was on Geektimes</a> ) at first glance looks like a lot of different "nettops", but in an attractive performance and with a fairly powerful stuffing:

The ventilation grille is located to the left of all the connectors (computer cooling is active, you should not put such a bedroom in the bedroom - the fan can be heard in complete silence). <br><br>  The bottom surface of the housing is almost entirely a ventilation grill.  The power indicator is located in front of the bottom. <br><br>  By the way, the entire display is made on white LEDs (except for the network activity indicator - it is two-color: white / blue), it looks along with a white glossy case very stylish. <br><br>  Operating system: Ubuntu Linux 14.04.2 LTS (64-bit version).  Between the power button and the power supply connector there is a mechanical button-lock. <br><br><h2>  Special features </h2><br>  On the one hand, it looks like nothing particularly outstanding in the characteristics, but on the other hand, ‚Äúeverything is on board‚Äù and the system is quite productive for most tasks. <br><br>  But this computer also has something that cardinally distinguishes it from others.  If you press the button-lock, then the upper part of the case can be removed, and the interior decoration opens: <br><br>  aBeing One supports installing <i>two more</i> hard disks (2.5 "SATA), and this is in addition to the 1TB disk that has already been installed. The disks are installed without any tools - just fix the disk in the corresponding tray, which is then simply inserted into its place. <br><br>  A little earlier, I mentioned that on the upper part are the activity indicators - three of them are reserved for hard drives. <br><br>  Also, there is a ‚Äúflap‚Äù behind one of the trays for additional disks, but nothing interesting was found behind it - the motherboard and the wireless communications board are visible (the part where the antennas are connected). <br><br>  In order to get to the main hard drive, you need to disassemble the entire case (already using tools), but I didn‚Äôt do it. <br><br>  The specification also has a Mini PCI Express slot, but I can‚Äôt say where it is located without disassembling the case. <br><br><h2>  Why is it needed? </h2><br>  Of course, aBeing One AZ10 can be used as a normal desktop computer by connecting a monitor and keyboard with a mouse to it.  However, it will be some ‚Äúnailing microscope nails‚Äù - not for this purpose it was created. <br><br>  The real purpose of aBeing One is to serve as a bridge between the Acer Open Platform cloud service and the home network.  Stop, why do we need an extra entity like the Acer Open Platform?  This issue is worth a closer look.  The fact is that a very small number of ‚Äúsmart‚Äù systems are absolutely self-sufficient and closed.  As an obvious example, perhaps the system of a plant, which works and is controlled from the inside, from a local network.  And the data stores in the same place on the internal server. <br><br>  For the most part, systems usually require some kind of access to external networks ‚Äî it can be for external control: for example, remote control of light.  Or to store the incoming data: you can, of course, simply dump the data onto the hard one, but if you need to quickly search through it or provide access to it for many users?  One company simply does not have enough resources for it, unlike the cloud.  Even external servers are needed to synchronize multiple systems that can not be connected to the local network. <br><br>  It is for these purposes that AOP is needed - on its basis, developers can build any system according to their needs and desires.  It is necessary - you can make aBeing One a local video server, which receives data from a dozen other IP cameras, and which with the help of the cloud provides access to this data with good speed from anywhere.  In the same cloud, you can store backup copies of devices or any user data. <br><br>  Figs with them, with cameras.  This task can be done by any video surveillance server.  But if you have at least several thousand sensors (it doesn‚Äôt matter that they are temperature sensors or GPS trackers), they give out some data second by second when the self-written system with the usual MySQL database swells up to a terabyte and starts to slow down, you understand that without a cloud is not enough.  And it seems that it‚Äôs not Bigdata, but there are clearly not enough brains of a couple of servers.  And it would be fine if there was just not enough memory, it is not so bad.  Much worse is that you lose the ability to analyze your data and analytics - this requires well-constructed indexes for fast searching and powerful multi-core processors for data analysis.  Cloud technologies help in these tasks - they provide easy access to large amounts of data, allow you to see the correlations between different events and present it all in a convenient way. <br><br>  ABeing One can be used more prosaically - for example, as a gateway between smart home devices and the outside world.  On board, there is already a BT4, with which you can connect to various BLE devices, such as fitness trackers, pulse meters, temperature sensors, controlled lamps, and similar devices.  Using USB and Ethernet, you can connect any transmitters and interface converters, be it Z-wave, ZigBee, RS485, Modbus, and so on. <br><br>  And then - complete freedom of action.  Although collect data from temperature sensors throughout the cottage or factory, even control the light and ventilation from the phone, at least make a system on the motion sensors that does not require light control at all. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/26e/08d/90f/26e08d90f20c4990b73e87ebf3d3103a.png">  It is especially simple to do all of the above, because the AOP has an SDK and an API with <a href="https://onedrive.live.com/redir%3Fresid%3DBF9A0C8AF629DB1B!106%26authkey%3D!AGIusjo48zgDvk0%26ithint%3Dfile%252Cpdf">detailed documentation</a> . <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c70/1cb/51b/c701cb51be3adae7e8cfefb25e659483.jpg"></div><br><h2>  What is left over? </h2><br>  aBeing One is a rather interesting computer with a wide range of applications with a bias towards the Internet of things.  One of the key differences is access to the capabilities and capabilities of the Acer Open Platform.  In essence, this computer is such a ‚Äútransitional link‚Äù between iron and clouds.  With it, you can easily associate an already developed or developed product with the Acer Open Platform, and then with any user device, phone, tablet or PC. <br><br>  For example, such a proposal will appeal to a company that is developing a WiFi-camera for home video surveillance.  They made the ‚Äúiron‚Äù of the camera, but it‚Äôs difficult for them to create their own cloud storage for storing video from these cameras.  They can use the Acer Open Platform and get a virtually ready-to-use cloud-based video storage infrastructure. <br><br>  <b>If you are a company that is developing devices that are somehow related to IoT, then Acer can offer you to take aBeing One for testing so that you can assess the potential of both the device and the AOP for use in your project - just <a href="">write a letter</a> .</b>  <b>And, of course, the company will be happy to receive feedback regarding work with any component of the system.</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/280356/">https://habr.com/ru/post/280356/</a></p>
