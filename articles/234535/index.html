There were no problems with the implementation, but it turned out that if using such a scheme with Objective C is still real, then fussing with Java wrappers is clearly not the best idea.  Plus, the model of freeing the memory of a minimized Android application imposes some restrictions on the architecture.  In general, it became clear that you could not cook porridge like that, and you need to enter from the other side.  Well, they started the Qt desktop version, which was written over the summer.  But alas, the release did not come out - the slurred fall of SQLite began with intensive work with the program.  It was not possible to quickly fix them, we had to rewrite the Model on QSql, and since one doesn't work at all anyway. <br><br><h4>  Release </h4><br>  After the new year, the release finally came out, and even got to Habr by March: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/992/453/13c/99245313c38848a89efaa74fa424e346.jpg"><br><br>  It became even more obvious that you need a mobile application, on the other hand, by this time Digia released Qt 5.2, which declared support for mobile platforms.  Already guess what rake was next?) That's right, we thought that once such a thing, you need to write a cross-platform application on Qt Quick, focusing for a start on Android.  Alas, the technology was very, very raw, especially for writing traditional applications.  Many widgets have to be implemented independently, and those that exist or do not look native or do not work as they should.  Yes, and with scaling for different screens had to tinker.  As a result, it turned out as a maximum schedule viewer and tasks, with which we can not see high places in the stores as our ears.  For the prospect of at least some monetization, not only full-fledged and native mobile applications are needed, but also access to Western students.  Well, even such little things as motivation and free time. <br><br><h4>  The king is dead.  Long live the king! </h4><br>  It would be a pity if, in general, a good and probably the right product will wither away, so we decided to open the source of all the developments, both desktop and mobile applications.  All you need to do is brush your code a bit, in general, coming soon.  To ensure synchronization through DropBox, which is implemented, but is not yet available in the current version, an official assembly will be published, because it will not work to put the private key in public access. <br><br>  Of course, we received an armful of invaluable experience on the full application development cycle, defended a diploma on this topic, and just just for fun, so we have no regrets about anything.  The experience of creating a desktop application is described in <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/istodo/blog/215053/">this</a> series of articles, and I plan to start sharing the development experience in QML in the coming weeks, including articles on writing custom components.  I am glad that the guys from Digia are not idle, they are actively fixing bugs, and this fall there will be a version with the support of the native Android theme, so the direction is very interesting. <br><br>  You can download the organizer <a href="http://istodo.ru/">here</a> , vk group <a href="http://vk.com/istodo">here</a> . <br><br>  PS Many thanks to TM for their startup support program - it‚Äôs really great. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/234535/">https://habr.com/ru/post/234535/</a></p>
