  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Stand-up, Scrum, Daily meetings - what it is and why</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Often I began to notice that people are increasingly drawing over methodologies and practices from IT to manufacturing, banking, services and others.  One of the most common "borrowed" from the world of IT practices is to hold Scrum, Daily, Stand-up rallies (as they are not called, but everywhere the essence is about the same).  Below is a description of this process in the way I conduct it personally. <br><br><h4>  General </h4><br>  This post describes the purpose and schedule of the daily rally - Stendap.  The basis of this process was taken from the scrum methodology and is part of the development process, in the future it can be adapted to the current team, as well as the development process.  As with any instrument, the use and attitude will determine the results. <br><br><h4>  purpose </h4><br><ul><li>  preparing for the working day and planning it; </li><li>  assessment of the previous working day; </li><li>  share information and plans with colleagues; </li><li>  Get information from colleagues, which can be useful during the working day. </li></ul><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  General Agenda </h4><br>  The most common and lazy response of an ordinary employee may be: <br><blockquote>  I did the task yesterday, today they will do the task, there are no difficulties. <br></blockquote>  Such answers are demotivating for holding status rallies.  It is a waste of time and meaninglessness.  If it seems to you that the task is one and it can be done for weeks, then this is already an error in approach, any big task is divided into subtasks, which help to see results and progress.

      Thus, you need to build your information as follows: <br><br>  <b>My activities yesterday:</b> <br><br><ul><li>  from what I did yesterday, I did ‚Äúthis‚Äù and ‚Äúthat‚Äù (an important focus here is on what I did, but not did) </li><li>  I did not do the plan outlined by me, did not finish ‚Äúsuch and such‚Äù things because ... </li><li>  ran into problems like this ... </li><li>  [perhaps last day you had meetings, information on which participants may be useful] who are interested in such activities - I can take the time or send MFU (Meeting Follow Up - a structured summary of the meeting).  [If they are not useful to anyone, then we can mention them quite casually, without going into details with whom, for how long, etc.] </li></ul><br>  <b>My activities for today:</b> <br><br><ul><li>  for the current day I plan to do the ‚Äúfirst‚Äù, ‚Äúsecond‚Äù.  From this I plan to finish the ‚Äúsecond‚Äù; </li><li>  rallies and meetings are planned, who will be interested. </li></ul><br>  <b>Problems or information about the need for assistance.</b> <br>  <b>General information that may be useful to all.</b> <br><br>  For example: I remind you, I go on vacation with the X number. <br><br><h4>  Rules of the rally </h4><br><ol><li>  It is necessary to come prepared to this rally in order not to waste time of all the participants, convulsively remembering what you wanted to say.  It is not considered shameful to bring your plan written on paper, devices.  Planning helps anyone to set the right priorities and goals for a productive day. </li><li>  The rally begins always at the same time on working days.  We have it at 10.30 am (it‚Äôs best to set 30min after the generally accepted start of the day).  Since it will provoke people as soon as they come to work, the first thing to do is ‚Äúwarm up mentally‚Äù, remembering the tasks of the past day and prepare a plan for the current day.  The rally is never canceled! </li><li>  The rally is held standing.  This measure is needed to remind everyone that a long story will be painful for everyone. </li><li>  The word transition is carried out according to the principle of the appointment of the last speaker (It is not necessary to speak in a circle in turn).  Begins a rally by agreement.  In order to dilute the stressful moment, you can buy a soft toy or a ball.  After the person has told his points - he throws the ball to a random participant among those who have not yet spoken.  Thus, everyone will be concentrated during the rally, and will be watching what is happening, because  everyone can be next, and will also monitor those who have already spoken, and who have not yet, so as not to throw a ball to someone who has already reported today.  K - concentration. </li><li>  Speech of each should not exceed 2 minutes.  In the process of developing a stand-up, this will teach people of brevity and brevity. </li><li>  It is important to build your report dryly and informatively, but it is equally important to be involved in someone else's report, even if you do not know what a particular colleague is doing, listen, try to understand, if you work together with common tasks, then it is certainly important to listen and can add information from myself to everyone.  But one should not interrupt in this case, but wait politely when a colleague finishes with all the points and immediately ask him to give the ball to himself in order to immediately add it, and if he has already said, ask for a couple of seconds of attention, make an addition and give the narrator queue differently at his discretion. </li><li>  If you have a question about the information that you have heard, do not need to interrupt or begin to discuss, you can note that you want to discuss the details after the rally. </li><li>  As already mentioned, it is important to set goals for yourself for the day - this is a very good way to motivate yourself. </li><li>  In the first couple it is best to have a ‚Äúdark moderator‚Äù, a person who will not explicitly let himself be shown ‚Äúmain‚Äù, but if the narrator ‚Äúhas suffered‚Äù, it‚Äôs unobtrusive to indicate that you need to speed up.  Or in case the story of one person contains a question, and at this moment someone puts in and starts a dialogue - interrupt it and say something of a kind: ‚ÄúGuys, this topic concerns both of you, let‚Äôs stay after the stand-up together and solve your questions without delaying the rest now ‚Äù </li><li>  After the last person has told everything he wanted, he should be moderated or the last (in our practice senior manager) to thank everyone for the stand-up and wish everyone a productive day. </li></ol><br><h4>  Additional practice </h4><br>  All members of the stand are united by a common goal, area of ‚Äã‚Äãwork, tasks, team, and most likely you have a chat group with the whole team.  In case a person doesn‚Äôt come to the stand-up for one reason or another, we ask to notify in the chat that the person is late today or will be absent in principle (this will be useful information for everyone who had joint plans with this person), and briefly summarize the answers to the main questions of the stand: <br><br><ul><li>  what did you do yesterday; </li><li>  what plans to do today; </li><li>  problems or blockers in his tasks; </li><li>  important information that will be useful to all. </li></ul><br>  It is important to focus on what people are!  should!  unsubscribe to this chat, and unobtrusively, but alludingly, to indicate that this kind of action is not welcome and will not be encouraged.  Personal presence is more important.  Thus, people who are often late or miss the stand-up will be lit up in the chat and it will be evident that it will be unpleasant for the latecomer himself and he will be embarrassed often late. <br><br><h4>  Where to look </h4><br>  An example of a stand-up is not exactly how we do it, but for understanding it will generally come down: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kKIc1NFO-AU" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/456980/">https://habr.com/ru/post/456980/</a></p>
