The result of these studies is the launch of a new course on the preparation of a universal fighter in the field of design - ‚Äú <a href="https://netology.ru/programs/fullstack-designer%3Futm_source%3Dblog%26utm_medium%3D747%26utm_campaign%3Dhabr">Fullstack Designer Profession</a> ‚Äù: such a specialist will do the layout, taking into account all UX / UI trends, and adjust the layout and not faint from the server side of the project.  Of course, we are against slave labor - if you can work for three, you should also receive wages for three.

      In the past, designers and developers had a clear <a href="https://medium.muz.li/ux-vs-ui-vs-ia-vs-ixd-4-confusing-digital-design-terms-defined-6e73c1d4dd4b">division of roles</a> .  Rarely did a person do both at the same time.  Currently, given the changes in product design and teamwork, many web designers are forced to develop <a href="https://www.mockplus.com/blog/post/what-is-user-experience-what-makes-a-good-ux-design/%3Fr%3Dtrista">UX</a> . <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Hence the question: what kind of character is this so-called fullstack designer?  Is it just a designer?  Or also writes code while doing design?  Or is it equally a designer and web developer? <br><br><h2>  Who is a fullstack designer? </h2><br>  In fact, the concept of a fullstack developer appeared earlier than the concept of a fullstack designer.  But "full stack" does not mean "doing everything."  In fact, this means that a person has multi-skills that allow him, independently of others, to create a design or develop a product. <br><br>  This means that a true fullstack designer can build the basic concepts of the project and carry out all the preparatory work related to design and development.  For example, prototype design, visual design, interface development, JS, jQuery, and so on. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2cc/f15/8e1/2ccf158e19dcc62a4413f3101d72014d.png"><br><br><h2>  Occurrence </h2><br>  The emergence of fullstack designers did not happen at one moment, it is entirely due to the current situation.  Due to the explosive growth in the popularity of mobile applications and the large flow of private entrepreneurs, many small development teams have emerged that individual specialists cannot afford.  This forces one to assume several roles, occupying one position.  You can always meet a developer who not only writes code, but also collects prototypes in special programs ( <a href="https://goo.gl/y62U1d">Mockplus</a> , <a href="http://www.axure.com/">Axure</a> , <a href="https://proto.io/">Proto.io)</a> . <br><br><h2>  Benefit </h2><br>  A comprehensive look at the product is the main advantage of a fullstack designer.  A specialist familiar with the product development process and its design process may anticipate the limitations imposed on the product.  Therefore, he can clearly monitor expectations from him. <br><br>  Getting to know the process allows the team to better understand the development, marketing, and users of the product  This makes the work more integral, reduces the number of improvements and unforeseen situations. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/659/a15/59b/659a1559baa94ea7013483562a72e4ec.jpg"><br><br><h2>  Value </h2><br>  A fullstack designer can analyze and improve his own "tree of knowledge" depending on the situation.  He can clearly understand the structure of the product, at what stage the development is and how the process goes.  He is a multi-skill man who can use the user's experience, design patterns, techniques and chips to complete the product development cycle.  Based on this, the process becomes more systematic and the result is a better product. <br><br>  The focus on the whole process is what distinguishes a regular designer from a fullstack designer.  If you are one, it certainly gives your team a huge advantage.  And if you work in freelancing, then you just need to be a full-cycle designer. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4aa/a6b/1a3/4aaa6b1a31367cf825c945bcfde852f0.jpg"><br><br><h2>  Distinguishing features of a cool fullstack designer </h2><br>  Nevertheless, the fullstack designer is not required to know and be able to do everything perfectly.  Taking the example of a web designer, you can better understand the roles described below. <br><br>  1. Assisting the product manager <br>  Creating a preliminary concept of the entire project, conducting brainstorming, filling the board with characters, basic planning. <br>  2. Design prototypes.  Sketches, visual drafts, low / high detailed prototypes. <br>  3. User research.  User experience. <br>  4. Testing <br>  5. Frontend development: HTML, CSS, JS and so on. <br>  6. Product transfer to the programmer: a deep understanding of the interaction between the interface and the software part, understanding how the front-end is better to dock with the back-end. <br><br><h2>  Conclusion </h2><br>  To become a good <a href="https://netology.ru/programs/fullstack-designer%3Futm_source%3Dblog%26utm_medium%3D747%26utm_campaign%3Dhabr">fullstack designer</a> , you will have to constantly learn new things and improve your ‚Äútree of knowledge‚Äù.  But keep in mind that initially it should be determined with the industry in order to effectively track trends and technologies in design, new patterns and new tools. <br><hr><br><p>  <em>The opinion of the author and the editors may not be the same.</em>  <em>Want to write a column for Netology?</em>  <em>Write to us and we are happy to cooperate.</em> </p></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/341056/">https://habr.com/ru/post/341056/</a></p>
