That the people that I need are not available.  I'm used to the fact that with the advent of a mobile phone, theoretically, you can find a person at any time.  It feels like a person can be found (reached) with a single click of a button calling a mobile phone.  And when suddenly a person becomes unavailable and it is annoying - ‚Äúthe battery of the village again‚Äù, ‚Äúin which bunker he (she) climbs‚Äù, ‚Äúit's all fucking (operator_name)‚Äù. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  I can unequivocally state that mobile2.0 will not be so until the end, if the problem of prolonged mobile phone operation is not resolved - after all, constant manipulations with the phone, the same screen backlight is active when you read a book on a mobile phone, play or surf on the mobile Internet, but there is More Bluetooth, listening to songs, flashes in the built-in cameras put the battery.  Well, or to the extreme, alternative methods of charging the phone, such as handheld dynamos, solar batteries with caps, or recharging using the heat of the human body. <br><br>  By the way, many people have probably seen on the Internet a proposal to buy an incredible battery capacity of 3600 mAh, for incredibly ridiculous prices - $ 7- $ 9 for a little thing.  A couple of people who were led to this, told that they had absolutely no effect in increasing the operating time of the phone.

      But now I want to congratulate us on the fact that the philosophy of absolute mobility, in particular absolute accessibility, is already wandering somewhere among us)).  I'm talking about such services that let you know who called when the phone was out of network coverage or was turned off.  Also pleased with the availability of services allowing the subscriber whose calls are disabled (and SMS) to inform the other subscriber to call him back.  By the way, together with the latest service provided by some operators, the service of transferring money from one mobile account to another allows you to quickly return a person to the online.  So, for example, one friend of mine when his wife used the service ‚Äúcall me back‚Äù (the subscriber receives a text message about what the other subscriber requests to call back), he did not call back but just put her money into the account. <br><br>  In principle, this also includes services allowing to determine the location of a mobile subscriber, both to himself and to other subscribers with his permission, as well as information about the nearest objects of interest (toilets, hotels, cafes, car repair shops, etc.).  Mobile operators charge money for determining the location, however, you can determine your location for free if you have a gps-module, but it is extremely rare in modern phones.  By the way, it is very convenient when you make an appointment for a person to send their coordinates to his mobile phone (I recently <a href="http://mobilemandarin.com/2007/11/01/neploho-byi-soobschat-sobesedniku-svoi-tekuschii-koordinatyi">rejected</a> this idea). <br><br>  Summing up on this point I want to emphasize that for the concept of mobile2.0, it is important to always be available, both for calls and for personal meetings. <br><br>  Written by me six months ago, <a href="http://mobilemandarin.com/2007/06/08/mobile20-vseobschaya-dostupnost/">here</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/18295/">https://habr.com/ru/post/18295/</a></p>
