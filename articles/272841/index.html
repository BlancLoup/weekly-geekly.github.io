      <b>200 years since the birth of Ada Lovelace, the first programmer of humanity</b> <br><br>  On December 10, 1815, a poet <a href="http://geektimes.ru/post/80800/">was born</a> to the poet Byron, who, in her 27 years in 1842, wrote the first program for the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/80334/">computer (steam) Babbage</a> . <br><br><blockquote>  <i>‚ÄúThe essence and purpose of the machine will change depending on the information we include in it.</i>  <i>The machine will be able to write music, draw pictures and show science such ways that we have never seen anywhere. ‚ÄùAda Lovelace</i> </blockquote><br>  <b>Ada</b> is a programming language created in 1979-1980 during the project by the US Department of Defense to develop a single programming language for embedded systems (that is, real-time automated system control systems).  First of all, onboard systems of control of military objects (ships, aircraft, tanks, missiles, shells, etc.) were meant.  December 10, 1980 was approved by the standard language. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e5c/2b5/bc9/e5c2b5bc900268645345ba8739979fad.jpg" alt="image" align="right">  Charles Babbage's <b>analytical machine</b> is a mechanical device, invented by the English mathematician Charles Babbage, designed to automate calculations by approximating functions by polynomials and calculating finite differences.  The possibility of an approximate representation in polynomials of logarithms and trigonometric functions allows us to consider this machine as a rather universal computing device.  [ <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A0%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B7%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D1%2588%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0_%25D0%25A7%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B0_%25D0%2591%25D1%258D%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B6%25D0%25B0">Wiki</a> ] <br><br>  Babbage created a description of the counting machine, which would be able to perform calculations up to the twentieth digit.  The drawing with numerous rollers and gears, which were set in motion by the lever, lay on the table of the Prime Minister.  In 1823, the first subsidy was paid for the construction of what is now considered the first computer on Earth and known as the ‚ÄúBig Difference Machine of Babbage‚Äù.  Construction lasted ten years, the design of the machine became more and more complicated, and in 1833 funding was discontinued. <br><br><blockquote>  <i>‚ÄúFor six months I was developing a more advanced machine project than the first one.</i>  <i>I myself am amazed at the computing power it will have! ‚Äù- Charles Babbage</i> </blockquote><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/comment_images/7af/f09/b06/7aff09b065b0c27922e18130f9943e97.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Part of the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A0%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B7%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D1%2588%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0_%25D0%25A7%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B0_%25D0%2591%25D1%258D%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B6%25D0%25B0">difference machine, Charles Babbage</a> , assembled after the death of a scientist by his son from parts found in his father‚Äôs laboratory.</i> <i><br></i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ae1/761/d9e/ae1761d9ef15173812b204fd782436d1.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>A copy of the differential machine in the London Science Museum</i> <br><br>  In 1842, Charles Babbage was invited to the University of Turin to hold a seminar on his analytical machine.  Luigi Menabrea, a young Italian engineer, and the future prime minister of Italy, recorded a lecture in French, and it was subsequently published in the Public Library of Geneva in October of the same year.  Babbage asked Countess Lovelace to translate the Menabrea records into English and accompany the text with comments.  Lady Lovelace spent more than a year on this work, after which the works were published under the acronym AAL and turned out to be more extensive than the records of Menabrea.  In one of his comments, Ada describes an algorithm for calculating Bernoulli Numbers on an analytical machine.  It was recognized that this is the first program specifically implemented for playback on a computer, and for this reason Ada Lovelace is considered the first programmer, despite the fact that the Babbage machine was never designed during Ada's life.
