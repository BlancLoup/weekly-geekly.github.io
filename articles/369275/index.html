And once in a conversation with him on this topic, I invited him to look towards the vacuum cleaner robots.  But for some reason he thought it was a whim.  After a couple of days in the new house, where, besides him and his wife, there are also two children who are actively studying and littering the space, he agreed.  And we began to study the market of robotic vacuum cleaners and found a decent option. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The choice fell on the robot vacuum cleaner iClebo Arte Carbon.  Consider this device in more detail.

At the moment, the line of devices is represented directly by iClebo Arte and its ‚Äúyounger brother‚Äù iClebo Pop.  In short, the main difference between the models is the presence of the cartographer at iClebo Arte, thanks to which it passes each section only once, but as efficiently as possible.  The younger model has only one brush and the movement is chaotic.  The colors we chose are Carbon, the design of vacuum cleaners is very stylish. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/216/925/92e/21692592e17aff2bbf7b5d94608371fa.jpg" alt="Side view of iClebo Arte Carbon"><br><br>  <strong>Why choose iClebo Arte?</strong> <br><br>  First of all, a lithium-ion battery, which is much more reliable nickel-metal hydride.  Even if the battery fails, it is cheaper than buying a battery, even on the simplest iRobot.  This is another plus of iClebo - inexpensive components: filters, brushes, spare parts cost about one and a half to two times cheaper than counterparts for iRobot.  If you want to save more - buy on eBay, despite all the jumps in the courses, the components there are cheaper.  Well and the main thing - a rich functionality for a reasonable price. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d5d/4e2/01c/d5d4e201c4726618a94fb0e93457d996.jpg" alt="Bottom view of iClebo Arte Carbon"><br><br>  <strong>What can iClebo Arte?</strong> <br><br>  First of all, he can quietly and quickly vacuum surfaces, including carpets.  Yes, he jumps over obstacles up to 2 centimeters boldly.  The carpet with a long thick pile "ironing" with a bang.  For a minute, the vacuum cleaner handles an area of ‚Äã‚Äã1 square meter, it takes a little longer to work with carpets.  The furniture drives around, guided by the readings of the sensors ‚Äî drives up to the leg of a table or chair, slows down, gently touches and drives around.  Never caused harm to any piece of furniture.  Yes, before his work, you need to completely remove all small and medium-sized objects from the floor - either he will pull in on himself or push around the room.  Wires also need to clean up - winds on the brush.  Sometimes it can stall in the curtains, so I also try to lift them on the window. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/af1/562/1a9/af15621a98b0eff467041dae9674a208.jpg" alt="Kit for wet cleaning iClebo Arte Carbon"><br><br>  iClebo Arte can clean the floor - an additional strip with a microfiber cloth is attached to the ‚Äútorso‚Äù of the robot.  We moisten a rag - here you and wet cleaning.  A friend got the hand to pause the vacuum cleaner, quickly rinse the cloth and put it back on the bar, it turns out that not only vacuumed the room, but also washed the floor.  With carpets, this function does not work, a rag clings to the carpet and falls. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/cae/f46/1ca/caef461ca657e141294ddb3595471dd4.jpg" alt="Wet cleaning iClebo Arte Carbon"><br><br>  It is very convenient to wash the vacuum cleaner - the container is easily removed, it can be washed with water.  All brushes and brushes also need to be cleaned, their hair is wound on them.  I think I have less hair on my head than the amount that was pulled from the vacuum cleaner after cleaning, where does it take them? <br><br>  The robot can drive in a straight line, it can work for a specified number of minutes, or run every day at a certain time.  Able to clean one square meter - convenient if you scattered something.  I advise you to use the maximum mode - first, the vacuum cleaner passes the entire area with standard movements, then additionally goes along the walls, and then starts to move erratically until the charge ends.  When less than 10% remains, the vacuum cleaner is sent to the base to be charged.  Base sees easily even from another room, not confused. <br><br>  Conveniently, there is a remote control; some modes are turned off only from it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d53/643/908/d53643908791138a8897c00bd33696dc.jpg" alt="IClebo Arte Carbon Remote"><br><br>  The charge lasts for 130-150 minutes of work, respectively, the robot will clean out at least 100 square meters of space on one charge. <br><br>  <strong>Why do I think that such a gadget is necessary?</strong> <br><br>  Judge for yourself, he is vacuuming for you, washing the floor, which means there will be less dust in the air and on the furniture, and this saves time for cleaning.  Plus, improving health, for allergies and asthmatics, the robot vacuum cleaner will have to be the way.  As for those who have small children or animals: a vacuum cleaner can easily handle both cookies and pieces of dinner, and wool. <br><br>  He was ordered from ebay and cost <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/icerobarte">$ 384.75</a> ( <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/dronk/blog/369275/">*</a> ), a decent amount, but he justified every cent. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/4s3OR5BnbfI%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgczBb5OUuNZKa7QrfsLwmV_thWWA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  That's all, with you there was a simple service for selecting complex technology <a href="https://dronk.ru/">Dronk.Ru</a> <br>  Do not forget to subscribe to our <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/dronk/blog/">blog</a> , there will be many more interesting things. <br><a name="ref"></a><br>  ps * - links marked with an asterisk referral, so you can save money by returning cashback up to 4%.
