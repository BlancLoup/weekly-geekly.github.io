  <section class="page js-page"><h1>DevOops 2017 Piter: New conference from the JUG.ru Group, let's talk about DevOps</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  A well-known fact: we in the JUG.ru Group are not doing conferences just like that, usually there is some problem behind the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãeach new project.  This was found with us. <br><br>  When we were young and cheerful and used the generators of static sites on Node.js (I‚Äôm secretly saying that we continue to use them), this is the story that happened to us.  We just moved to AWS and took the simplest EC2 instance, naively believing that 10 Gb of space for a dozen static sites is enough for us.  However, one day we started to catch errors from the server that the disk space ... was over.  10 sites on 10 Gb of space.  Of course, we didn‚Äôt believe the enemy messages and quickly found that the inode had actually run out. <br><br>  A quick search revealed a nasty culprit - it was <s>JavaScript</s> Node.js, namely the node_modules folder.  They counted an inode, and realized that there were a hundred thousand of them there.  Okay, we thought, and screwed another 100 gigs.  And now everything is fine: 630k inode is busy, but there is still 6kk on top of the Node.js dependencies.  I hope we have enough of this for the next six months ... And by the time they start to end, at the new conference we will find out how to solve this problem elegantly.

      But seriously, on October 20 we will hold a <b><a href="https://devoops.ru/">DevOps conference DevOops 2017 Piter</a></b> .  One day, three tracks, all as you like.  Who will speak, that we will discuss other details - under the cut. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/581/0c3/cf6/5810c3cf6d664d4fa87512d979b8efae.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  <b>Briefly about the main thing</b> </h2><br>  The conference will be devoted exclusively to technical issues and traditionally hardcore.  No management techniques, teambuilding and software skills.  We will talk about development automation (Jenkins, TeamCity, Bamboo), monitoring and debugging applications (New Relic, BPF, Dynatrace, XRebel, Glimpse and others), cloud technologies (AWS, Azure, Heroku and others), admin hardcore (containers, virtualization , orchestration, configuration). <br><br>  In addition, we will try to pick up reports with debriefing of large projects implementing DevOps: not only successful, but also failures.  We believe that smart people can learn from the mistakes of others and will try to make you aware of the rakes that await you. <br><br>  The conference will not be tied to a particular stack of technologies, so everyone will be interested. <br><br><h2>  <b>Speakers</b> </h2><br>  Since there are still 4 months before the conference, there are not so many speakers yet, but everyone is a real find!  I would divide the already confirmed speakers into two categories: ‚Äúuseful and incendiary‚Äù and ‚Äúuseful and hardcore‚Äù.  See for yourself, in the first category with us: <br><br><img align="left" width="200" src="https://habrastorage.org/web/434/1a6/0e9/4341a60e985c4dcbb9d260a2bf346a5c.jpg">  <b>Baruch <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/jbaruch/" class="user_link">jbaruch</a> Sadogursky</b> is one of the most prominent DevOps gurus who speak Russian.  An excellent speaker, developer advocate from JFrog, a regular debriefing podcast "Debriefing".  <s>he has even verified twitter!</s>  .  Sometimes it mows under Javista to get on the Joker and JPoint, and, it should be noted, it does it very well!  One of the main organizers of <a href="https://swampup.jfrog.com/">swampUP</a> , a cool DevOps conference taking place in the Valley. <br><br><br><br><br><img align="left" width="200" src="https://habrastorage.org/web/a49/438/ffa/a49438ffad3b40bd8de593aca6b8ccba.jpg">  <b>Leonid Igolnik</b> is an experienced speaker, developer from CA Technologies with a twenty-year background, a venture capitalist.  To understand how cool Leonid is, you simply listen to the <a href="http://razbor-poletov.com/2017/04/episode-133.html">133 edition of the</a> ‚ÄúDebriefing‚Äù. <br><br><br><br><br><br>  If you pay attention to tech-fun, then there is more choice: <br><img align="left" width="200" src="https://habrastorage.org/web/81f/f9f/e1a/81ff9fe1a3d445e7b08d659001483374.jpg">  <b>Oleg <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/m0nstermind/" class="user_link">m0nstermind</a> Anastasyev</b> is an evil genius who forces nearly tens of thousands of servers to continuously process millions of messages per minute without crashing and braking.  Oleg will talk about the cloud system of automatic resource management, which saws in Odnoklassniki, and, you know, I am sure it will be cool. <br><br><br><br><br><br><img align="left" width="200" src="https://habrastorage.org/web/219/bd5/623/219bd56237fa40848dda445a9e70ecca.jpg">  <b>Sergey <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/bsideup/" class="user_link">bsideup</a> Egorov</b> is the presenter of the <a href="https://www.2d1o.ru/">DevOps podcast 2d1o</a> , hardcore, what to look for, and, by the way, the first person who was able to clearly explain to me what DevOps is. <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><img align="left" width="200" src="https://habrastorage.org/web/884/70e/9d3/88470e9d3a684843ace9d450a9544ed9.jpg">  <b>Nikolay Ryzhikov</b> is the Technical Leader of the Health Samurai team, which successfully creates a new generation medical system for automating the activities of doctors and other medical personnel in the United States.  An activist from St. Petersburg's Ruby &amp; Clojure communities and the PiterUnited meta-community.  Fire performed on Joker and HolyJS.  Guru and man-orchestra, perfect for DevOps! <br><br><br><br><br><img align="left" width="200" src="https://habrastorage.org/web/63d/fd0/16a/63dfd016a69d499da14692217293f5dc.jpg">  <b>Paul Stack</b> - Developer from HashiCorp (developers Vagrant, Vault, Consul, Terraform, Otto) will share a hell of a hardcore about developing tools for DevOps engineers. <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><img align="left" width="200" src="https://habrastorage.org/web/b49/b04/585/b49b04585864409788d01fcaa328671f.jpg">  <b>Erno Aapa</b> - devopser for 6 years, active speaker and independent consultant, founder of the Finnish <a href="https://www.meetup.com/devops-finland/">DevOps community</a> . <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><h2>  <b>Reception of reports is open</b> </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/afb/025/a07/afb025a0793041cab289341ad6cfa443.jpg"><br><br>  If you like not only to receive knowledge, but also to share it, pay attention: now is the time <a href="https://devoops.ru/callforpapers/"><b>to submit a report to us</b></a> !  Although our strict program committee includes only really good performances in the program, the same committee helps the speakers bring their promising developments to the appropriate level - so even if you do not have much experience in speaking, but there is an interesting topic, do not be afraid to apply. <br><br>  And if you have experience, refer to the video recordings of reports that you did earlier, and this will significantly speed up the decision making by the program committee. <br><br>  The main requirement: your report should be useful to other developers.  We are interested in reports on the following topics: <br><br><ul><li>  Containers, Orchestration (Docker, Kubernetes, Clusters, etc). </li><li>  Virtualization, Cloud Technologies (AWS, Azure, Heroku, and others). </li><li>  Monitoring and auditing applications (Prometeus, OkMeter, DataDog, BPF, Dynatrace, XRebel, Glimpse, Zipkin, OpenTrace and others). </li><li>  Continuous Delivery (Jenkins, TeamCity, Bamboo). </li><li>  Configuration Management (puppet, chef, ansible). </li><li>  Security (Vault, etc.) </li><li>  Debriefing on examples of large projects implementing DevOps: successful and failed. </li></ul><br><h2>  <b>Program committee</b> </h2><br>  In the previous section, I wrote that the Program Committee would strictly judge the submitted reports and actively assist those who are ready to prepare.  In reality, the composition of the PC on DevOops is impressive: they are not just high-class engineers, they are speakers and participants with dozens of conferences and meetings behind their shoulders.  In the near future, a complete list of PC members will appear <a href="https://devoops.ru/">on our website</a> . <br><br><h2>  <b>Discussion areas</b> </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d33/cca/609/d33cca60961f4445af0112232e1c8c8e.jpg"><br><br>  As with any of our conferences, there will be discussion zones at DevOops.  Surely, you know the feeling when you raise your hand to ask a question, and the presenter suddenly announces: ‚ÄúThere is time for one question‚Äù - and of course, the choice does not fall on you, but during the break the speaker is hiding behind the door of the speaker‚Äôs room. <br><br>  It is the discussion zones that answer the question ‚Äúwhy go to conferences, when you can learn everything on the Internet‚Äù.  It's simple: to personally ask your personal, specific question.  Well, we have all the conditions for this: in long breaks, specially trained volunteers will lead the speaker into the allocated space with a board for recordings and illustrations, seating and the opportunity to grab a cup of coffee.  And here no one will limit your questions, comments and observations.  Now not a single question will drown in timing. <br><br><h2>  <b>check in</b> </h2><br>  The conference program will gradually be replenished, and you can follow its most current status on the <a href="https://devoops.ru/">DevOops 2017 Piter</a> website.  And now <a href="https://devoops.ru/tickets/">the sale of tickets</a> is <a href="https://devoops.ru/tickets/">open</a> on this site - the early bird price is valid until the end of June.  Therefore, it is better to follow the development of the program with a ticket in your pocket :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/331346/">https://habr.com/ru/post/331346/</a></p>
