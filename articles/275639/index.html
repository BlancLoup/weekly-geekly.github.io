  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Expansion of a network of monitoring sites: Europe, Latin America, India</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e4c/fd9/05e/e4cfd905ec8d46ec9b873e9b14bc46b5.png" align="left"><br>  Another expansion of the <a href="http://www.host-tracker.com/">HostTracker</a> service monitoring network.  We are constantly working on adding new servers to be as close as possible to the client and to provide the most accurate information about the work of the sites being checked.  This time, the <a href="https://www.host-tracker.com/Agent/List">list of our agents is</a> replenished with servers from Italy, India and Costa Rica. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  What is the network expanding for? </h5><br>  There are several reasons for the expansion.  The first reason is technical.  The more servers, the less likely that the accidental failure of one of them will somehow affect the result of the checks.  In addition, the goal we recently announced ‚Äî creating agent sets for each region of the world or even for individual large countries ‚Äî requires many agents in each region so that each client can do only by the number of servers that are located in close proximity to the target audience of his site.  Also, the quality of a number of functions ‚Äî checking response time, site speed and some others ‚Äî directly depends on the physical remoteness of the checking server and the site being checked. <br>  The second reason is psychological.  It would seem that every IT specialist understands that if the site is hosted in Berlin and suddenly becomes inaccessible from Amsterdam, then there is definitely a problem, as the boundaries are not an obstacle for the main channels of the Network.  Nevertheless, we repeatedly had to deal with situations when networkers or server administrators asked to provide these checks only from their country, and even better from their city.  Specialists of other professions - managers, salespeople and advertisers - are mostly less aware of the network infrastructure, and therefore it seems logical for them to check the site from a specific region where their clients are concentrated, and not from all over the world. <br>  We ourselves discovered the following reason not so long ago.  By adding a server in a specific country, we add a link to the partner company on <a href="https://www.host-tracker.com/Agent/List">the description page of our network</a> .  Of course, we understood that search engines immediately begin to index all of these links.  But at a certain point we noticed a pattern: we add a server in a certain country - the number of clients from it increases noticeably.  For small and remote countries, from where there were very few or even no customers, this is especially noticeable. <br><br><h5>  How and why can you become our partner? </h5><br>  Expansion of the network occurs both on the basis of rental hosting, and at the expense of our partners.  Partners provide their servers for our software (which has the minimum requirements and practically does not spend system resources) free of charge, or with a significant discount, and in return receive a link to their site on our page.  The value of the work of these links has already been mentioned above.  In addition, partners receive a substantial discount on our service if they need it.  Well, plus in karma, of course. <br><br>  You can become a partner by filling out a <a href="https://www.host-tracker.com/Agent/Create">small form</a> .  We will be glad to your wishes and suggestions! </div>
