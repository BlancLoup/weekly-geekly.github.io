People of the forties.  3, 15. </blockquote><br>  So what should be the charter of your monastery so that a newcomer who has just left the walls of an educational institution, or a person who decided to change the type of activity, or simply a ‚Äúshipped specialist‚Äù, accepted him as his own and not only began to promote it. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://digitaloctober.ru/system/img/events/1209/important.png?time=1449755265?time=1449755265" alt="image"></div><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  "Articulate" relationship </h3><br>  Working in the IT field, I often came across cases when a recruit who came to the team simply did not accept the generally accepted norms of the team and did what he wanted.  The reason is the most common one - the absence of some unwritten statute as such.  As a result, a team is an environment and a group of like-minded people.  It is good if in this group there are well-established traditions and forms not of ‚Äúcoexistence‚Äù, but of a harmonious life. <br><br>  The main disputes of the team, if it can be called that, concern not only the approach to solving a specific task in the project, but also to the very distribution of tasks.  There, where there is no order, there will be no productivity and as a result everyone will fence their own house, which he wants.  The hesitations about the choice of the development stack begin, the eternal debates ‚Äúon what we write and how we do‚Äù.  As a result, the work falls apart, deadlines fall and soon the ‚Äúteam‚Äù ceases to exist.

    <h3>  Manuscripts, Covenants, Traditions </h3><br>  So, you have decided to lay the very principles of the work of the team entrusted to you in some unwritten rules and customs.  There are 2 directions of these covenants: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Professional <br>  ‚Ä¢ Informal communication <br><br>  To professional can be attributed manuals for setting up the workspace, all possible descriptions of the processes occurring within working hours.  There are also mini-articles as ‚Äúwe deploy to the battle‚Äù, ‚Äúwhere we have a test, preproduct and product live‚Äù and other topics.  As a rule, this is stored in some Confluence or any other knowledge base.  Such bases are conducted by 3 specialists of different directions: <br><br>  <b>1.</b> Project managers or system analysts.  Usually project documentation. <br>  <b>2.</b> Senior-developers.  The development stack, where what lies and how to live with it. <br>  <b>3.</b> Head of unit.  Who to contact the company as a whole, a description of any career ladders, grades, and so on. <br><br><h3>  General tips </h3><br>  If more or less everything is clear with professional manuals, then what about the atmospheric particles of collective life?  Do not write the documents about when we have a corporate party or a foray into a regular pub in the company's knowledge base.  There is no universal way to easily introduce a person into a team.  Moreover, all people are different, and IT shnik are often still introverts.  There are cases when a person believes that it is not really necessary for him, because he came to write the code. <br><br>  To begin with, you as a leader are required to carry out the following simple steps: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ conduct a tour of the company; <br>  ‚Ä¢ conduct a welcome training; <br>  ‚Ä¢ introduce a new employee to the team; <br>  ‚Ä¢ draw up a feasible work plan with such deadlines, so that the new employee can accomplish everything in advance without much effort; <br>  ‚Ä¢ to carry out individual work with the newcomer to analyze mistakes, to repeat the phrase more often: ‚ÄúThe one who does nothing is not mistaken‚Äù. <br><br><h3>  Personal experience </h3><br>  I'll tell you what mechanism for entering the team is in service with me.  While working and failures did not give. <br><br>  When a new team member is already familiar with the team, add him to all sorts of team communities.  We have a group in whatsapp.  Since at dinner we play all sorts of games from Mafia to Poker to offer to play with the team.  These games significantly liberate and allow you to meet with colleagues not only as specialists, but also to see their informal side. <br><br>  Joint tea breaks with livers are also very helpful.  The informal part of communication is just as important as communication on working moments. <br><br>  Further more.  We have a tradition of going to the 2nd and 4th Friday of the month in the pub (advance payment and salary, you guessed it).  We agree about this in advance in our group of the messenger.  What can I say: moderate consumption of light alcoholic drinks or just drinks in an informal setting removes not only stress, but also some kind of office work framework. <br><br>  No less important are corporate parties, but not those carried out by the whole company.  Here there is a view of attacks on recreation facilities, on pokatushki (snowboarding, skiing) - believe me, even those who have been afraid of this all their lives are getting up. <br><br>  Having once banished a cycle of intense command life for the year to the next year, those who have already gone through this will want to leave it.  Further, having adopted like-minded people who have fallen in love with the ‚Äúrules of the collective,‚Äù it is not difficult to tell the newcomer how cool and cool it is. <br><br>  Treat the team as a second family and its ‚Äúhouseholds‚Äù will never want to substitute you at work or leave the house. <br><br>  <i>Picture from site: digitaloctober.ru</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/313026/">https://habr.com/ru/post/313026/</a></p>
