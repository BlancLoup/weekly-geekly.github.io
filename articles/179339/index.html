Particularly noticeable is the attitude to the “Winde” that started spreading and the very warm attitude to old toys like Digger.

Com Command, and the father Vyndouz goes by. <br>  “Sit,” says.  - Oh well.  Soon everything will sit under me. ” <br>  Nobody answered him anything.  One t. Com Command spat and cursed dirty. <br>  “Come in, come in,” he said, “the shell is cheap.” <br><br>  - I am surprised all the same by how much hard drive eats about.  Wow!  - Spoke for a breakfast to K. Norton. <br>  “Why be surprised when he has a solitaire,” commented Com. Com. <br><br>  All day, Com. Com Com went enlightened, and when he met Vyndouz’s sad father, he even asked affectionately: <br>  - Or did something happen, father? <br>  “All the icons have been stolen,” Father Vyndouz said and wept. <br>  “Ah, they are non-Christians,” commented t. Command Com, “oh, they are cheap shells!”  And his mustache moved cheerfully. <br><br>  Digger asked once. Command Coma: “Why do you, com. Com Command, dislike Father Wyndouz?” <br>  “It stinks of mice,” he quickly replied. <br><br>  “Gentlemen,” commander Norton told Digger and so on. To the Command To, “Great Russification happened yesterday.”  It is ordered to give all Russian names. <br>  They began to think.  Well, the commander Norton was immediately called the lieutenant Northern, Digger and Digger so left.  But comrade. Command Who did not like a single Russian name.  They wanted to call him Ivan Komov, but he got angry: “Shells,” shouts, “are cheap!  Mice bred! " <br><br>  - Do you remember the first version of Dos, Comrade Com?  - asked Digger t. Command Coma. <br>  “No,” he cried, “only the song remained of her,” and sang: “OS, DOS, Trans.  Ver.  DOS, and grandma is healthy ... " <br><br>  Once, having woken up, t. Com Command did not find autoexec.bat.  This shocked him so much that he could not calm down until he found out the date, month, year, hour, and minute.  And although later the situation with autoexec.bat was often repeated, because the Command Team continued to ask the date and time with such persistence that everyone finally forgot how it started. <br><br>  “Comrade Command Com has recovered,” Digger said, looking at Comrade passing by. <br>  “2.7 kilos,” said Commander Norton. <br>  “So what song are we going to sing today, Norton?”  - asked Digger. <br>  “Duc,” answered Commander Norton, “Yankee Doodle.” <br><br>  “What do you think, Norton, who are we going to be in the next life?” Digger asked Commander Norton. <br>  “Duc,” Commander Norton replied, pressing Control-Alt-Del. <br><br>  Somehow Comrade Com Com went to Africa, and there he was bitten by a fly.
