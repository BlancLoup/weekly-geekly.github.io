      The truth is that Ivideon is a service, a program code, algorithms, and the camera is a service entry point.  According to this principle, we decided to reduce (forever) the price of Nobelic.  Now use the service easier (and more profitable). <br><br>  So far, we consider the Nobelic to be the most optimal entry point into Ivideon.  And why so - we will tell further. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Nobelic has changed our ideas about sales.  It is ridiculous to remember that the first models we positioned as a universal solution for the home.  Practice has shown that we were wrong. <br><br>  Soon it became finally clear that cameras are chosen not only for home but also for office use.  Shops, fitness clubs, gas stations, hairdressers, cafes - everyone ignored our marketing calculations and bought "home" cameras.  After the purchase of a Nobelic camera, 44% of our users connect the cloud archive and switch to paid rates. <br><br>  Nobelic models can be described as full-fledged box solutions for quickly organizing a simple, secure and efficient video surveillance system.  But first things first. <br><br><h2>  Optimum minimalist design </h2><br>  If we talk specifically about the design of models, then it can be described as strict, without excesses, but with recognizable elements of the ‚Äúauthor's style‚Äù.  However, judge for yourself. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/p9/ef/4r/p9ef4rw9yyrtdafrkzp01bfbsmw.png" alt="image"><br><br>  From left to right: NBQ-1110F with Wi-Fi, NBLC-1110F-MSD with POE, outdoor camera NBLC-3130F-WSD with Wi-Fi. <br><br>  The first two cameras we call the "triangle" and "cookie."  By the way, who will guess why a cookie, and not, for example, a brick?  Write in the comments version. <br><br>  It seemed to us that the white color would help the cameras fit perfectly into any modern office or residential interior. <br><br>  As always, life has made its own adjustments.  We were asked: "Everything is ok, but where are the black cameras?" <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ck/a1/sx/cka1sxry1tpuc2xwqgpc7w2lty4.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  I had to start black.  With rounded edges. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/abb/922/810/abb9228108d04ef197d49cc5dc5951cf.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  On the front side of the device are a lens, a status LED for the camera, an infrared light, a microphone and a speaker. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c79/612/661/c796126615794383beb879cfdfd119ef.JPG" alt="image"><br><br>  All switching ports are located on the back side, there is also a secret reset button. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a65/4f3/d64/a654f3d646dd40899a32c9b05ad692e7.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  On the bottom cover of the camera is a microSD card slot of up to 128 GB. <br><br><h2>  What is included?  Unboxing rustling </h2><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Hmnzp01L0WQ" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  They put everything necessary in the box so that you could quickly install the cameras and get started, except for our beautiful stickers.  Write if you like the stickers and you want to see them in the box. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/-m/fi/8x/-mfi8xwamnfm6cpqdf9ayiu4rwq.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  In addition to the camera, in the box you will find a power adapter, a mounting template, 3 self-tapping screws with dowels and a user manual.  The package also includes a proprietary bracket that allows you to easily lock the camera in the desired position. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/579/063/7de/5790637de20643b0937a8aba53c478c8.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In fact, you can simply put the camera on a flat surface - it will work.  Or magnetized to any piece of iron - for this, the 1210 series has a magnetic base. <br><br>  Recall that the presence of the mounting template will help, if necessary, quickly mark points for drilling mounting holes in the place of installation of the camera.  You need only a pencil, drill, drill and screwdriver. <br><br><h2>  Opportunities </h2><br>  First of all, we note the extended range of operating temperatures: from - 10 to + 45 ¬∞ .  Such characteristics are now typical for any device.  Even on the iron so write.  No one thought anyone would take it seriously. <br><br>  It turned out that way - literally.  Cameras are used not only at home or in the office, but also, for example, in the garage. <br><br>  We used to think that Ivideon appeals to those who want maximum comfort.  No DIY, soldering iron and a robot made from a younger sister, camera and tape.  Everything is simple, of course, act strictly according to the instructions. <br><br>  In 2019, we have to admit that we underestimated users.  Otherwise, how else to explain that someone began to use the camera outside its official characteristics.  So they <a href="https://www.ixbt.com/live/dv/obzor-kamery-videonablyudeniya-nobelic-nbq-1110f-13mp-s-wi-fi-dlya-doma-i-ofisa.html">write</a> : ‚ÄúThe camera is designed for use in a room with a temperature of minus ten degrees, in fact it can work even at temperatures below those stated.  With minus 15 it works, I did not check it further. ‚Äù <br><br>  The Nobelic NBLC-1110F-MSD is equipped with a 1.3 megapixel sensor that forms an image with a resolution of 1280 x 960 pixels.  A used lens with a focal length of 2.8 mm provides a camera viewing angle of 95 ¬∞. <br><br>  The characteristics of the matrix do not allow using it to track down a bear at night in the taiga, but to solve everyday office and home tasks it‚Äôs 100% hit the target. <br>  Moreover, with such a picture, even our face recognition system and other analytics will work without problems.  Another argument in favor of the fact that the separation of cameras into "home" and "for business" is conditional. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/87a/e0c/156/87ae0c1567d306d2e45635d60900c52d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  For those who need to see about thirty meters, there are advanced specimens in the series.  So <a href="https://ru.ivideon.com/shop/product/kompaktnaya-ip-kamera-nobelic-nblc-1410f-wmsd/">NBLC-1410F-WMSD</a> is equipped with a 4-megapixel sensor, which allows you to get a video series with a resolution of 2688 x 1520 pixels with a viewing angle of 106 ¬∞. <br><br>  Thanks to the powerful built-in infrared illumination system (effective at a distance of up to 10 meters), all major models record a detailed and high-quality picture regardless of the light.  Even in complete darkness, you can see everything that happens in the field of view of the camera, but in black and white.  But we still do not recommend tracking down bears. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/e9/qo/no/e9qonohezdalpz8qrz4rx0lyg70.jpeg" alt="image"><br>  <i>You can configure the detector yourself, as well as change many other parameters through the mobile application.</i> <br><br>  Built-in motion detection activates video recording only when it is necessary, so as not to waste resources.  Plus, when it is triggered, you will automatically receive e-mail and push notifications.  So, even being outside the object, you can always be aware of the events. <br><br>  The microphone integrated into the camera will help to quickly control the situation on the protected area, and the presence of the speaker allows you to use it in the voice video communication mode. <br><br>  Such functionality can be useful to you in various life situations, for example, when observing a child (the function of a remote nanny) or a pet. <br><br>  Some will argue, they say, the built-in audio section of most cameras is not of sufficient quality and animals will not listen to you.  For those who doubt the quality of the cameras, at the end of the article we have posted a selection of real videos recorded with their help.  Watch, listen and rate video and audio quality.  It shows the experience of operating such devices in most cases, pets very quickly adapt to the owner's voice, sounding from the speaker, and willingly carry out its commands. <br><br>  Note that the presence in the models of network Ethernet and Wi-Fi controllers provides high switching flexibility.  In addition, when working with our cloud-based video surveillance service, Ivideon cameras can use data encryption with an asymmetric key.  Over the entire period of operation of this technology, not a single fact of hacking of encrypted data was recorded.  Such statistics can not boast of manufacturers even more expensive systems. <br><br>  By the way, acquiring other cameras (for example, Xiaomi Yi Home Camera 720p), which, as a rule, broadcast the video stream in the clear, you should not be surprised that your private life may become public.  Note also that many Chinese cameras do not use data encryption even when connected via the Telnet protocol. <br><br>  We, of course, strive to be open, but not so much. <br><br>  As they say, if you care about privacy and personal data, take care of it yourself.  And our system will help you with this. <br><br>  The undoubted advantage of Nobelic devices is the ability to record video sequences on an external microSD card.  Thanks to this, you can quickly and without unnecessary operations get a copy of the video on physical media.  Cards up to 128 gigabytes are supported, which is twice as many as many competitors. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/737/a83/30e/737a8330ed714f68b17eb529a898e5be.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  You can also make a copy of the video directly through our cloud service.  Get information in any way convenient for you.  Plus, this hybrid storage technology will reliably protect you from any technical failure. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zc/vc/7l/zcvc7l7wupuepwkxtwpnt33yz_y.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  For your convenience, created applications for working with cameras through mobile devices <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ru/app/%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BB%25D1%258E%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5-ivideon/id464234175%3Fmt%3D8">based on iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.ivideon.client%26hl%3Dru">Android</a> .  They have a high rating.  On Google Play, we achieved an estimate of 4.5 out of 5 with more than 2 million downloads, without exaggeration it can be called one of the best results in the industry. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/dd/yw/ke/ddywkel3i8mxmnvky3-qeojglwk.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  The video cameras can be powered both from the included network adapter and (for some models) via an Ethernet terminal using PoE technology. <br><br><h2>  We create a video surveillance system </h2><br>  Create your own video surveillance system using Nobelic using the technology of our cloud service in just a couple of minutes.  To do this, simply install the camera in the right place. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/hg/2r/df/hg2rdfbgad0k-_xsakluvwiitem.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  Cameras quickly connect and configure any user who can work with a smartphone.  For easy connection to our service, you can use the QR code, reading it in the application.  You no longer need to bother and pay for a static IP address, configure the address translation table on the router and make many other settings. <br><br>  At the moment, our service is the only video surveillance platform built on the basis of geographically (dynamically) distributed data centers providing work at the same level of quality for users around the world.  Thus, users of Cambodia and Ryazan see the same Ivideon service. <br><br>  For home surveillance systems there is a free rate that supports up to 15 cameras in one account.  To control your home is enough.  In addition, you can transfer the access rights to each connected camera to two other users for free. <br><br>  Do you want to give access to a larger number of users or bring the broadcast to the public, so that thousands of people connect to it?  These opportunities are opened on business tariffs. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/0i/hf/yz/0ihfyzncgbpexbaerfwhhbfg-z8.png" alt="image"><br><br>  You can view video from cameras, both using a PC and using a tablet or smartphone after installing the application. <br><br>  All settings of camera modes are carried out in a personal account or in an application.  You can also set up a motion and sound detector.  To do this, you need to select zones in the frame whose activity will be monitored and analyzed.  Due to this, you can avoid the reaction of the camera, for example, the movement of trees from the wind. <br><br>  In our practice was a very interesting case.  At one client, 2 cameras out of 20 were installed to monitor the back of the building, fenced in order to avoid product theft.  He set up a motion detector, marked the activity zones, but after a certain time he began to complain about the false alarms of the cameras.  The reason turned out to be simple: the fact is that the ventilation ‚Äúfungus‚Äù fell into the designated area of ‚Äã‚Äãactivity.  And when a lot of equipment was working in the workshop, the fluctuations of the heated air caused false alarms of the detector.  Of course, we helped to make a more precise setting of the zone of activity. <br><br>  All the Nobelic cameras out of the box support the Ivideon video analytics, in particular, they can connect <a href="https://ru.ivideon.com/blog/face-recognition-ivideon/">a face recognition system</a> . <br><br><h2>  Examples of real video </h2><br>  An example of how the Nobelic NBLC-1110F camera shoots under artificial lighting conditions (such scary words for scientific means office light): <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nlZ854uJIfM" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  In this video you can see, first of all, the wide viewing angle and accurate color reproduction (and this is very difficult to achieve when using fluorescent lamps).  The video sequence is devoid of the characteristic flickering noise, which usually spoils the picture recorded under fluorescent lighting. <br><br>  Also pay attention to the quality of shooting a moving object, the high sensitivity of the microphone and the quality of voice transmission.  Even small details are distinguishable in the image, and dynamic fragments of the video sequence are recorded as smoothly as possible, without annoying jerks and other artifacts. <br><br>  And here is an example of a nighttime video shot using the Nobelic NBLC-1110F: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hvg_f6WpL-o" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  The shooting was carried out in complete darkness using standard infrared illumination.  The image makes it quite easy to recognize and identify not only the object of observation, but also the objects of the surrounding interior. <br><br>  The following video Nobelic NBLC-1110F is interesting for two reasons. <br><br>  First, we paid attention to the work of the sound path of the camera.  And secondly, the shooting was carried out at different levels of backlight, so that you can evaluate the quality of the camera in such difficult lighting: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5sUCC-HPTQQ" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  When watching a video, listen to how accurately and clearly the audio section of the camera works with sound.  The speech of the company's employees and the sound of the flying ball are transmitted by the camera with almost no distortion and delays.  And the excellent work of the video path in backlight allows you to see the picture with maximum detail.  Sometimes it creates the feeling that we are watching the recording not from a video surveillance system, but from a professional video camera. <br><br>  In conclusion of the story, rate the video about the Push-to-Talk function.  Recall that with its help, using a microphone and a speaker embedded in the camera, you can send voice messages: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Mrf2x_ZXoJs" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  You only need a smartphone and our proprietary application. <br><br>  The cost of <a href="https://ru.ivideon.com/shop/product/nobelic-nbq-1110f/">Nobelic NBQ-1110F</a> 5 500 rub. <br><br>  <a href="https://ru.ivideon.com/shop/product/nobelic-nblc-1110f-msd/">With PoE</a> 5 900 rub. <br><br>  You'll see other Nobelic cameras in the <a href="https://ru.ivideon.com/shop/">store</a> .  For many models, prices are reduced by more than 10% </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/454346/">https://habr.com/ru/post/454346/</a></p>
