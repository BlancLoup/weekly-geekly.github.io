Nevertheless, there are enough myths, the belief in which will condemn your enterprise to the utter failure.  To avoid growth lag in your business, watch out for these five common myths about the growing millionaire business. <br><br><h4>  If you build it, they will definitely come </h4><br>  For a million business, it is vital to have a great product or service.  However, a great product alone will not ensure your success.  Customers do not always buy the best product - they buy the one about which they know, whom they trust and in the ratio of price-quality of which, there is no doubt. <br><br>  To prevent your business from slowing down as a result of this myth, invest in marketing and distribution.  Create a great team, and then you will start, not just with a bare idea. <a name="habracut"></a>

    <h4>  To start you need a lot of money </h4><br>  Do not think that you have to be a millionaire to grow a company to this level;  Many modern successful businesses were created for very little money.  In an interview with Harvard Business Review, Linda Rottenberg, founder and CEO of <a href="http://www.endeavor.org/">Endeavor</a> , noted that half of the companies on the <a href="http://www.inc.com/inc5000/index.html">Inc.</a> list are  <a href="http://www.inc.com/inc5000/index.html">500</a> was started with less than $ 5000.  And if you take into account the potential of <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259A%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D1%2583%25D0%25B4%25D1%2584%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B3">crowdfunding</a> , you can see that you can start a startup without searching for investors. <br><br>  If your cash reserves are small, start by reducing unnecessary expenses.  Start with the simplest and test your ideas in small markets.  If your tests succeed, grow and scale, while maintaining a steady return. <br><br><h4>  Expansion is equivalent to revenue growth. </h4><br>  Unfortunately, business growth is not equal to income.  If you have laid a solid foundation for business, then growth will ultimately lead to revenue.  In the short term, however, adding new team members, expanding operations, and automating can cost more money than it does. <br><br>  To prevent harm from the influence of this myth, think about what you need and when you need it.  Balance expansion and revenue, and be prepared to accept the deliberate risk of investing in your company's future. <br><br><h4>  Tactical growth is preferable to strategic </h4><br>  Founders of <a href="http://www.growthcloud.com/">The Growth Strategy Co.</a>  They note that many companies make a mistake thinking that growth is only a function of sales and marketing.  However, marketing and selling a company is a short-term strategy ‚Äî without a long-term plan built on sustainable market demand, they must either eventually run out or require continued investments that your company cannot afford over time. <br><br>  In order to maintain the strategic imperative, think about what the market currently requires and what product you can create to meet these needs.  By focusing on consumer offers and creating long-term growth prospects, you can build a market that will further allow your company to grow to a millionth scale. <br><br><h4>  Teamwork is always based on agreement. </h4><br>  Leadership is the most important aspect of entrepreneurship.  When you grow, it becomes even more important, as those who believe that working together is always built on the basis of consensus will not be able to go beyond certain limits.  A strong leader, on the other hand, understands that there are times when he must take responsibility, even if it means implementing potentially unpopular decisions. <br><br>  To avoid this trap, be prepared to change the management structure as you grow.  While mutual understanding may work satisfactorily in a small team, and you perform all the control functions, a tiered management structure may be necessary when you increase the number of employees and departments.  If you are flexible and can take the next step when you need it, your team will respect you and always follow you. <br><br>  Building a million business is the goal of many entrepreneurs.  Defending yourself from these myths and treating your company's growth wisely, you can easily reach the million dollar mark ‚Äî and more! <br><br>  Suzhan Patel has been working in internet marketing for over a decade and currently holds the position of vice president of marketing for <i>thisCLICKS</i> company, creators of <a href="http://wheniwork.com/">When I Work</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/283962/">https://habr.com/ru/post/283962/</a></p>
