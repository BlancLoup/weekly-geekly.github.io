It is represented in the segment of budget phablets: it costs 5,390 rubles.  Laconic and compact device allows you to get several in the body of one gadget.  Thanks to a complete set of wireless modules, the tablet can replace the smartphone and the navigator.  It is interesting to consider the "Pioneer" in more detail. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f04/f09/7f9/f04f097f9b4be04417dac4e77c97ee64.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Specifications </h2><blockquote>  <b>Processor:</b> Spreadtrum SC7731G (4 cores) <br>  <b>Screen:</b> 7 ", touch, capacitive, 1024 x 600 pixels <br>  <b>Memory RAM / ROM:</b> 1 GB / 8 GB <br>  <b>GPS:</b> Built-in <br>  <b>Battery:</b> Built-in, 3,000 mAh <br>  <b>Connectors:</b> MicroUSB, Jack 3.5 mm, MicroSD <br>  <b>Buttons:</b> Power, Volume ¬±, Reset <br>  <b>SIM card support:</b> 2 pcs. <br>  <b>Size:</b> 189.5 x 108.5 x 9.5 mm <br>  <b>Weight:</b> 275 g <br>  <b>Operating system:</b> Android 5.1 <br>  <b>Camera:</b> Front - 2 Mp, main - 2 Mp <br>  <b>Data transfer:</b> Wi-Fi: 802.11b / g / n, Bluetooth 4.0, 3G (900/2100 MHz), GSM: Dual Sim, 850/900/1800/1900 MHz <br>  <b>External power:</b> 5V, 2A, constant voltage <br>  <b>Memory Card Support:</b> MicroSD up to 32 GB <br>  <b>Speaker:</b> Built-in, 1W. </blockquote><br>  Before us is a seven-inch tablet, which operates on the basis of the Spreadtrum SC7731G quad-core processor.  For practicing multimedia everyday scenarios, the user is provided with 1 GB of RAM.  It is interesting to find out whether the claimed power is enough for comfortable launching and passing games, as well as for viewing streaming video in high resolution. <br><br><h2>  Contents of delivery </h2><br>  The tablet has an unusual packaging: a red-orange cardboard box with a pioneer asterisk and inscriptions in the style of Soviet posters.

      Inside is a simple one: manual, warranty card, power adapter and USB-cable.  Everything.  Perhaps the headset would not be superfluous, because we are offered to use the tablet as a smartphone, but it is not included. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/552/8ba/90f/5528ba90ffa2936f0ff7c1c4ef819054.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/582/ef7/114/582ef71146cdf09bfb06798f7c400ea8.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/828/73b/c42/82873bc42239feb40a3965170e701f81.jpg"><br><br><h2>  Android 5.1 operating system </h2><br>  The new version of Android is different from the previous changes in the interface, improved security and a high level of efficiency.  Interface elements appear with other, updated icons.  Now they have become more "flat", got the shadows.  Switching between applications happens smoothly and without jerks.  There are no ‚Äúproprietary shells‚Äù and no excess of pre-installed software - only the ‚Äúbare‚Äù Android 5.1 system and several applications from Yandex. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ea6/0f1/136/ea60f1136029b9a74d2bd78ca455fffc.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/31b/19e/767/31b19e767ada507909d0a302103d0719.png"><br><br><h2>  Performance </h2><br>  Wary of a small amount of RAM: 1 GB.  But in conjunction with a good Spreadtrum SC7731G quad-core processor, even powerful games feel confident if you run them at medium settings.  The transfer of graphics is smooth, the system's hardware resources are enough to play, for example, in Asphalt 8 and Minion Rush without slowdowns.  After a few hours of playing time, the tablet body heats up, but only slightly. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a7c/918/0b1/a7c9180b1fd6c34c819539acce48b6c3.png"></div><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/218/cbd/d40/218cbdd40ff1484e1818120416327e74.png"></div><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/357/0e5/643/3570e5643f10a8cd01eb7a6f9274ac9d.png"></div><br>  720p streaming video is also played without interruption.  The only point is a perceptible lack of permanent (built-in) memory.  There is only 8 GB of it, and 5-6 GB is available for use, which means that it is better to fill the slot for the memory card immediately after unpacking the tablet.  The rest of the gadget confidently feels and performs the functions of a mobile "entertaining".  If you want to get a tablet model that is more focused on powerful games, you can look at other bb-mobile tablets based on eight-core processors - already on sale, for example, 8-inch bb-mobile TOPOL 'LTE. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/abe/86b/f20/abe86bf20b709581794dae03b4440a3b.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/78d/149/0cd/78d1490cd4633a789839cf442f41720e.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/007/75a/252/00775a2520ca100854c778a41bcbeebc.png"><br><br><h2>  Appearance </h2><br>  The exterior of the device is not unusual.  It is a classic tablet in black or white (there are two color options to choose from) case, similar to other bb-mobile devices in its segment.  Above the display, a peephole of the front two-megapixel camera is viewed, behind it is the same one belonging to the rear camera.  It is surrounded by a removable cover frame that hides SIM card slots and memory cards up to 32 GB.  One of the side ends is empty, and on the second side by side there is a power button and a volume control swing.  Headset jacks and USB-cords are on top. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d0b/1f0/237/d0b1f02378dbff22359aa24697e742e1.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/867/6f8/f2e/8676f8f2e9e3aefb293ddf70c29063d0.jpg"><br><br>  The tablet weighs 275 grams, because it can be held even with one hand: the brush does not get tired and does not experience a significant load.  The frames around the display are the same size, about two centimeters thick each.  This allows you to avoid accidental clicks when reading or watching movies.  The case is not too easily soiled, the device is tight: you don‚Äôt need to fit it.  The movement of the mechanical keys is clear.  In general, for good-quality assembly and conciseness of design, "Pioneer" deserves praise. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/473/029/764/4730297647eee4307ac262634046aa1e.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/77a/572/466/77a572466bdf0a12e9946cc3ed11543a.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d7c/04c/cb4/d7c04ccb416c822ce1f9af9500a2184b.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/686/42d/e02/68642de02cbc163acc2f1cbfb901dc30.jpg"><br><br><h2>  Display </h2><br>  Seven-inch display pleases with decent color reproduction and lively, natural picture on the screen.  The factory film pasted on the tablet screen does not interfere with the precise operation of the sensor and does not blur the picture.  Any touches are worked out clearly and practically without delays.  Brightness reserve is high: even in sunny weather, the image on the screen is easily distinguishable.  The touch layer supports up to five simultaneous clicks. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/555/39a/fdf/55539afdf34b07b89a2dea496afd166c.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a55/699/88c/a5569988c7084a8d3af42db3e40f3670.jpg"><br><br><h2>  Camera </h2><br>  As befits a modern device, bb-mobile Techno Pioneer S700BF is equipped with front and rear cameras.  Each resolution: 2 Mp.  Frontal is better to use for video conferencing, and the capabilities of the main camera make it easy to ‚Äúgrasp‚Äù fonts, even those shot in a room with an insufficient level of lighting.  The text in the pictures does not merge into unreadable mush, frames are not blurred.  Also, the rear camera is suitable for shooting during the day, in the night mode objects clearly lack clarity.  In general, quite average cameras that you expect to see in the budget tablet. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b02/278/7e9/b022787e93cd07a186b8e130437bc144.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d06/a98/4b4/d06a984b4c2e98a36797a100e59112d8.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e39/edd/778/e39edd778158dfa0d7ae933c5e8e6e30.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a9b/0ae/9c7/a9b0ae9c7a5f989bbbfe90939fd45dac.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/16f/6a9/7b8/16f6a97b894793314df0641c74225827.jpg"><br><br><h2>  Wireless network </h2><br>  All major wireless modules are implemented here.  In order to always stay in touch, support is provided for two SIM cards and voice calls.  When one number is busy, the second is in standby mode.  There are no headsets, but surely experienced users of smartphones and phablets have a favorite model that can be used to increase the level of comfort during long conversations.  As a bb-mobile Techno navigator, the Pioneer S700BF shows itself in the best possible way: a quick ‚Äúcold‚Äù launch and confident communication with satellites even in dense areas of high-rise development are provided.  The 3G module allows you to get high-speed access to the Internet, and Bluetooth 4.0 support provides connectivity to modern fitness gadgets: you can ‚Äútie‚Äù your tracker to the tablet or connect a device with home appliances by creating the Smart Home system and using the review hero as a control panel . <br><br><h2>  Autonomous work </h2><br>  In the "Pioneer" uses a battery capacity of 3,000 mAh - the average for phablets with a screen diagonal of 7 inches.  Its charge lasts about 8 hours, if you use the tablet as a gaming platform.  Working with disabled wireless modules in reading mode allows the Pioneer to do without an outlet for 1-2 days. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6fa/494/c9b/6fa494c9bcd5da5470746a08acf014f6.jpg"><br><br><h2>  Results </h2><br>  bb-mobile Techno Pioneer S700BF - a tablet of a solid build and with good functionality.  And the hardware platform based on the quad-core processor, and the appearance give a good gadget, suitable for daily viewing, games, reading, communication and navigation.  A compact device fits easily in a jacket pocket, and its weight is such that it allows you to comfortably hold the device even with one hand.  To all other advantages, a record low price is added for a device on the current Android 5.1 platform.  For bb-mobile Techno, the Pioneer S700BF ask for only 5,390 Russian rubles: a great price for those who want to get a productive gadget and don‚Äôt pay half the monthly salary for it. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/390877/">https://habr.com/ru/post/390877/</a></p>
