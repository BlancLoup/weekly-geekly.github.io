  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Our world, perhaps - one huge hologram</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  (Abridged translation.) <br><br>  Experiment GEO600, Hannover.  In the open field - two perpendicular trenches, covered with metal.  Inside is a detector, 600 meters long.  The last 7 years there have been looking for (not found) gravitational waves emitted by neutron stars and black bodies.  Scientists in the laboratory did not know how to explain the strange noise in the measurement results.  Suddenly, a certain Hogan (Hogan, USA) appeared with an explanation.  According to him, GEO600 stumbled upon a fundamental space-time constraint - a point where the continuum can no longer be represented as a solid (according to Einstein), but behaves like "grains", such as photo grain in a newspaper.  ‚ÄúGEO600 measures space-time quantum oscillations.  If this is exactly where this is happening, then we all live in a big cosmic hologram, ‚Äùsays Hogan. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Conventional holograms are printed on a 2D base.  Light reflects from them and recreates a 3D image.  In the 90s, physics Zyuzkin (Susskind) and Hooft (Hooft) suggested that this principle can be applied to the universe, and our being can be a holographic projection of the processes occurring on a remote two-dimensional surface.  Their idea stems from pioneering work on black holes by Bekenstein (Bekenstein, Israel) and Hawking (USA).  In the 70s, Hawking proved that black holes are not exactly black - they slowly radiate, evaporate and disappear.  But there is a problem - Hawking radiation does not carry any information.  When the black hole disappears, all information about the insides of the hole disappeared, which is contrary to the principle of preserving information - and here is the information paradox of black holes.  Beckenstein determined that the entropy (informational content) of a black hole is proportional to the surface of its event horizon.  And, then, already after this, it was proved that quantum pulsations on the event horizon contain coded information about what is inside the black hole, and the loss of information in the process of evaporation of the black hole does not exist.

      It is important here that the 3D information about the insides of the hole is all encoded on its 2D event horizon!  Zyuzkin and Khuft extended this to the whole universe, on the grounds that space also has a horizon ‚Äî a boundary beyond which the light of the entire 13.7 billion existence of the universe did not go out.  Maldacena (Maldacena, USA), a string theory theorist, also showed that physics in a hypothetical five-dimensional saddle-shaped universe is exactly the same as physics on the four-dimensional boundary of this universe, drawing a parallel between the physics of spaces of different dimensions. <br><br>  Physicists have long believed that quantum effects will generate chaotic space-time pulsations on a microscopic scale (Planck's constant is 10e-35m), where the continuum tissue is discrete.  It is beyond the reach of any conceivable experiment.  But Hogan discovered that the holographic principle changes everything.  If the continuum is a granular hologram, then the universe is a sphere whose surface is made up of information bits, of Planck size.  The amount of information should be equal on the surface and inside the universe.  And since the volume of a spherical universe is larger than its surface area, the inner world must be composed of grains larger than Planck's size: around 10e-16m. "In other words, the holographic universe is blurred," Hogan told himself and wondered how to discover.  This is where GEO600 appears on the scene.  Hogan sent his questions there, Danzman from there sent him a schedule with noise in frequencies from 300 to 1500 Hz, complaining that he did not know his reasons, and, by the way, he had been tormented for a long time.  Hogan saw on the charts exactly what he expected. <br><br>  The detector is arranged as follows: they light up the laser through the beam splitter, from there 2 beams pass through two perpendicular bodies, are reflected, come back, merge together and create an interference pattern, where any distortion indicates a change in the ratio of body lengths, since  gravitational wave passes through the body, and compresses / stretches the space in different directions in different directions.  The device is sensitive to changes in the length of bodies, smaller than the diameter of the proton, and physicists in GEO600 only did that they eliminated all noise one by one (their source was found - clouds, seismic activity, etc.), and then increased sensitivity again, and repeated. <br><br>  Uncertainty in Hogan's idea is that this noise could have been generated by local factors, as noted by Danzmann, and says that we will be happy no sooner than a year later.  There were similar precedents in the story.  So in 1964, relict radiation was discovered (+ Nobel).  Another detector for finding (not found) a hypothetical form of radioactivity in which protons decay, found that neutrinos can change their type - a step towards understanding how the universe turned out to be filled with matter, not antimatter. <br><br>  The way forward, according to Hogan, is to use an atomic interferometer.  It uses rays from super-cold atoms instead of a laser, and atoms can behave like waves at shorter wavelengths than light. <br><br>  It is said that if the holographic principle were confirmed, he would have denied all approaches to quantum gravity, which do not include the holographic principle.  Conversely, it would be a powerful leap for those based on it ‚Äî including some derivatives of string theory and something called matrix string theory.  ‚ÄúIn the limit, we would have our first understanding of how space-time flows from quantum theory,‚Äù says Hogan.  In a series of recent discoveries, it is difficult to find more innovative than this. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/83375/">https://habr.com/ru/post/83375/</a></p>
