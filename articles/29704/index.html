  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Star site</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  It was the turn of the next project from the series that is proposed for joint implementation.  This is actually a new version of the promotion of content.  The essence of the proposal is that specialized web and wap sites are created where the products provided (pictures, photos, music, chat, etc.) are combined into groups (hereinafter referred to as the ‚Äúgroup‚Äù) with reference to a certain known person (group) - it's easier speaking to the "star". <br>  What are the benefits for business?  1) There are a very large number of "stars" (or those who consider themselves as such) in the regions, in Russia, in the world.  Moreover, under the star further we mean any famous people - these can be not only singers of different directions, but <br>  and for example actors, politicians, models.  In relation to each of them there is an opportunity to generate the corresponding content - at least a set of photos.  For singers, the group may include a set of photographs, melodies of the songs they perform, chat, and news.  For athletes, a number of personal photos and photos of his sporting achievements, chat, <br>  slogans, news and comments.  For politicians and humorists - photographs and statements (pearls), etc.  2) not all of the stars have their own site (especially professionally supported), but this page <br>  as such, they can declare, 3) Such linking attracts fans and fans to the consumption of services - and this is a huge market of regular consumers, who often spare no effort, and most importantly means <br>  at least somehow be closer to his idol.  4) Binding to the stars will also save on advertising.  If you are interested in a star with a percentage of the sales of its content group (you can use part of the advertising <br>  budget) - he will carry out advertising himself, placing the codes of his content group on disks, recalling in interviews, simply calling for his fans to use this service. <a name="habracut"></a>  Moreover, the stars will be interested in increasing the volume of sales for reasons of self-promotion - it will be a kind of rating, who is more ordered and more popular.  On the other hand, this service will contribute <br>  retaining the memory of famous people of Soviet times (for example, actors, performers), and while transferring a percentage of sales, will also support them financially (a kind of social function of this service) 5) The ability to set higher prices for <br>  the content being offered, since having bought the melody of a favorite artist, the subscriber will most likely want to download his photo as well, <br>  find out the news.  Content for the site can be typed on the site either by participating in all affiliate programs of other content providers (aggregating content), or directly from the stars themselves. <br>  Products that can be provided using the proposed service: ¬∑ pictures and photos of stars (any available photos, including those provided by the stars themselves) ¬∑ autographs of stars (autographs adapted for mobile phone screens) - this item can be viewed as a separate offer ¬∑ autographs on photographs <br>  stars ¬∑ if you want a star, the ability to ask and answer questions on sms ¬∑ star tunes, tunes from movies with his participation ¬∑ <br>  the opportunity to buy and download songs in mp3 format ¬∑ sms-mailing with information about a star or about a star ¬∑ other content that can be associated with a star in any form. In addition, for users who are ready <br>  to give up even greater means it is possible to provide individual content: ¬∑ personal autograph or greeting from a star (the ability to order a greeting or autograph for a specific person with his name, surname) ¬∑ for phones and networks supporting such a function - ordering a video greeting or a song for a specific event . <br><br>  Thus, this service will allow the subscriber to transform his phone so as to show everyone that he is a fan or even a fan of a famous person, group, sports team and <br>  also receive real-time information about a star or from a star, using a subscription to the sms-newsletter included in the group.  At the same time, the subscriber will not need to look for the necessary pictures, photos, melodies, etc., about his idol every time (which is now forced <br>  do fans), since all of this will be collected within one group in a certain way systematized codes.  To simplify use, you can use the navigation system: on the installed <br>  number sending an sms - message, for example with the word "list" - the subscriber will receive a list of stars, the service for which is currently available (for example: Pugacheva, Zhirinovsky, Zadornov, Madonna, Spartak). <br>  By sending an sms with the name of a star to a number, it will receive the available information on this star - the names (descriptions) of photos with order numbers, melodies, etc ... By subscribing to the sms mailing, the subscriber will be <br>  receive information about the appearance of new content in this group.  Prices probably should be set differentially, depending on the popularity of the star.  Perhaps the initial establishment of inflated prices for services, followed by their reduction by groups or types of product belonging to the group to which there is little interest from customers.  The cost of providing individual content from the stars <br>  should be as high as possible, not allowing the queue for the service. <br><br>  In addition, for some of the stars can be sold on the pages of the relevant products that they release under their own name.
