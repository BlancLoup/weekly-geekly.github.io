  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Makhost: how to return your domain (except. RU)</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  If the makhost distributes hosting, then here is my article.  (I wrote a draft, I waited how it would end, and I forgot.) The life story about how to regain control of a domain registered through <a href="http://lurkmore.ru/%25D0%259C%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BA%25D1%2585%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2582">Makhost</a> .  Return domains RU has already been discussed <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/domains/91599/">here</a> , and I will tell you about the passage of a similar quest with foreign domains. <br><br><h4>  Prehistory </h4>  My sites lived on Makhost until April 16th.  When the second shutdown occurred, I moved the sites to another hosting.  At the same time I decided to control the domains directly, through the registrar admin panel.  Two RU domains were transferred easily: I registered on Webnames, asked Makhost to transfer control to my account, which was done.  There was one more .MOBI domain, fortunately there was no existing site on it. <br><br><h4>  Level 1 </h4>  Webnames said they needed an authorization code, which you can get from Makhost or from a registrar.  I turned to Makhost, an employee with a rare name <i>Pulp Flup replied</i> .  The dialogue blew the brain: <blockquote>  - How to get an authorization code for the domain ****. Mobi? <br>  - We do not issue the code, you can manage the domain through us. <br>  - How can I manage a domain through you without using hosting? <br>  - It is necessary to use hosting services. </blockquote>  We'll have to contact the registrar ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Level 2 </h4>  Using <a href="http://whois.domaintools.com/">DomainTools, I</a> found out that the registrar is DirectI.  We could not immediately find a feedback form, the company has several projects, each project has its own website ... As it turned out, customer support can be contacted <a href="https://support.directi.com/">here</a> .  Using the knowledge of English and Google Translate, I wrote something like the following: ‚ÄúHow can I find the authorization code for a domain ****. Mobi?  The domain is registered through Makhost, they refuse to report the code. ‚ÄùImmediately they sent a password to the support system.  An hour passed, another ... there was no answer. <br>  About two hours later, a letter arrived from Makhost with an authorization code (by the way, from another employee).  A little later, a message appeared in the DirectI support system stating that my message was transferred to some department (I did not remember the name in long and in English).  And then the code itself was written there too.  Identity confirmation was not asked, apparently it was enough that the e-mail address in the domain data and the one specified during the call match.

      <br>
    <h4>  Level 3 </h4>  In the Webnames admin area there is a ‚ÄúTransfer Domain‚Äù item.  There I indicated the domain name, entered the authorization code.  After that, you must pay for the renewal of the domain for at least a year, then a letter comes to the domain administrator's e-mail asking if it‚Äôs really necessary to transfer the domain.  Naturally, I agree (just waiting for this). <br>  Then comes another link - "if you want to refuse the transfer, click here."  The link is valid for five days.  As soon as they expire, the domain is transferred.  Hooray! <br><br><h4>  Instructions + result </h4><ol><li>  Ask Makhost authorization code (authcode).  If they refuse, we go further. </li><li>  We register on Webnames (or any other registrar that supports your domains). </li><li>  We determine the registrar with the help of DomainTools, we write to him that Makhost is scoundrels, they do not give the code. </li><li>  Get the code, transfer and extend the domain. </li></ol>  Bottom line: Makhost is trying in every way to keep customers, sometimes using the most filthy ways.  The quest to move to another hosting is not so easy to perform, but sometimes it is easier than it seems, and certainly worth the effort. <br><br>  <i>Detailed objective substantiated article about Makhost.</i>  Hosting is not needed, thank you. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/96874/">https://habr.com/ru/post/96874/</a></p>
