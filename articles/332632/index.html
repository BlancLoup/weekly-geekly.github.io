  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Rewarded Video: the best show scripts or how to make your ad look</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/d09/e83/851/d09e838510db4a0d9be9e396c9fc9b2b.jpg"><br><br>  The Rewarded Video (RV) format is growing rapidly: users of such advertising is almost not annoying, since the choice - to watch or not to watch - remains for them.  However, reward video works according to the same Pareto law: you need to spend time developing an RV placement strategy to squeeze the most out of this type of advertising. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In theory, advertising in the application should be initialized as early as possible in order to correctly display the maximum number of videos downloaded.  It would seem that in this case it is easier to show Rewarded Video right after entering the application - but this is not recommended.  This decision will hit retention rate and reputation metrics.  The user is unlikely to want to return to the application, where video ads are imposed on him immediately after the loading screen. <br><br>  In addition, Rewarded Video should not be allowed to start at the top of the application from a commercial point of view: it takes time to search for more expensive ads, with a higher eCPM. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>

          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>

      Another feature - creative (video itself) in the Rewarded Video format weighs more than other types of advertising, respectively, and takes longer to load.  ‚ÄúWaterfall‚Äù from ad networks (see diagram) is polled for 15-20 seconds, and it takes about 30 seconds to load a creative. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/d57/697/cd0/d57697cd049546efa935a025134e8215.gif"><br><br>  <b>App store</b> <br><br>  As a rule, the app store calls to buy in-game currency, and Rewarded Video is present in it as an option.  In this case, the video is initialized at the entrance to the application and stored in the cache until the user detects it.  The problem is that the user, as a rule, rarely enters the app store and does not know about Rewarded video. <br><br>  What options?  The way out of the situation is to upload a video when we understand that a user is about to enter the store because he is running out of currency.  Also, try sending notifications to the player that they‚Äôre running out of money (‚ÄúHey, do you want a coin for free?‚Äù).  Reminding of the opportunity to watch a video and replenish the stock of coins between levels is also quite logical. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/959/c48/db5/959c48db5c194661a75d6faba2933ab4.png"><br>  <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/canyon-crash-fall-down/id1216850919%3Fmt%3D8%26ign-mpt%3Duo%253D4">Sanyon Crash - Fall Down</a> <br><br>  By the way, a good way to load and even show a video at the start is the format of daily awards.  For example, immediately after loading, the user sees a ringing box (anything can be in its place), which calls for watching a video and get a daily reward. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/96a/149/c47/96a149c4738a43f680c6e20443466fc1.png"><br>  <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.tinyco.familyguy">Family Guy - The Quest For Stuff</a> <br><br>  Such action can take place once a day or once a week or two, at your discretion.  Approximately the same format of pumping is good for tappers, where Rewarded video can be shown many times in exchange for building a building, updating characters, and so on. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/c65/b57/25a/c65b5725a98942c787aed3b429d0760b.jpg"><br>  <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.monster.pix%26hl%3Den">PixelMon Hunter</a> <br><br>  <b>During the game</b> <br><br>  The first opportunity to show a video to a player is a situation where the level has not yet been completed, but the moves are over.  The user is between two fires: either start the level again, or get a few moves for viewing ads.  Display Rate (ratio of the shown advertising to the loaded) in this situation remains quite high, since the advertisement is initialized in advance, at the moment when there are few moves left and the player is notified about the reward. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/f7b/563/dd9/f7b563dd992140adb7071bcbd772195b.png"><br>  <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/blasty-bubs-brick-breaker/id1192356712%3Fmt%3D8%26ign-mpt%3Duo%253D4">Blusty Bubs - Brick Breaker</a> <br><br>  Another good option is to show video ads in exchange for tips in the game.  For example, a user suffers for a long time with the same level or cannot solve a puzzle - then after several unsuccessful attempts, you can offer him video advertising in exchange for a clue.  So did the developers from the studio Rusty Lake, who create a <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/PavelGolubev/20170602/299105/Interview_The_Hidden_Secret_of_Building_A_Cult_Following_to_Monetization.php">mystical puzzle</a> inspired by Twin Peaks.  At some point, they realized that the riddles in the game are too complicated, and added video ads to get hints.  This move raised both player loyalty and revenue. <br>  In addition to hints, there are many ways to motivate a user to watch a rewarded video ‚Äî for example, offer him superpower, doubling of rewards, or another chip that makes it easier to play. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/f70/44c/843/f7044c843a4140158343b1571abfa7a1.png"><br>  <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dair.com.dg.differencegames.hiddenobject.hiddenworldsadventure%26hl%3Den">Hidden worlds adventure</a> <br><br>  Obviously, you can create many scenarios for games, but Rewarded video also works fine in utility applications.  You can reward any closed content for watching videos, including customization of the application.  For example, this format works great for dating applications, where the user has a rating and the ability to promote his profile higher in the rating. <br><br>  Important: Whichever video integration option you choose, the reward for viewing it should be as obvious and important to the user as possible.  There are many examples in which the Display Rate remains low, despite the correct placement of advertising - this suggests that the reward is not obvious to the player. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/340/75b/437/34075b4373f546eca004e8f96c9e510d.png"><br>  <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/canyon-crash-fall-down/id1216850919%3Fmt%3D8%26ign-mpt%3Duo%253D4">Sanyon Crash - Fall Down</a> <br><br>  Remember about the <b>balance of the in-game economy</b> .  Those who do not want to part with in-game purchases can alternate video with a reward: for example, a player can watch a rewarded video and get a reward only once every 2-4 hours, and may not wait and buy it for real money.  For example, here are some applications connected to Appodeal with successful use of rewarded video: <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/color-six/id1140447903%3Fmt%3D8">Color Six</a> , <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/lolo-puzzle-game/id1103238599%3Fmt%3D8">Lolo App</a> , <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ru/app/block-strike-multiplayer-survival-shooter/id1076977383%3Fl%3Den%26mt%3D8">Block Strike</a> , <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dair.com.dg.differencegames.hiddenobject.hiddenworldsadventure%26hl%3Den">Hidden Worlds Adventure</a> . <br><br>  <a href="https://blog.appodeal.com/blog/2016/09/15/rewarded-videos-irresistible-format/">Title Image Source</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/332632/">https://habr.com/ru/post/332632/</a></p>
