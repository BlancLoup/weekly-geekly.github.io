A bit of everything, but I want to start with the real life - with audio tags. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The quality of the recording, the gland for podcasting and the rules of good tone for podcasters are many among the well-known in the podcast-environment <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/umputun/" class="user_link">Umputun</a> - and in its podcast <a href="http://tipz.umputun.com/">Typus - Theory and Practice of Recording</a> and <a href="http://tinyurl.com/ykr5hr4">KMB for the podcaster</a> .  Here in the rules of good tone I would like to continue about the nuance of such tags.  Audio tags, if anyone does not know, this is a structured set of information about the audio file (name, track number, album, artist, etc.).  Different audio formats can support different tag formats.  IDv3 for example is the format of mp3 file tags, there is a tag format for WindowsMedia files, the same mp3 format is multi-tagged and may contain such kinds of tags as ID3 and APE of different versions.  Many podcasters either simply don‚Äôt bother, or don‚Äôt waste time on beautiful and proper tagging.  And in vain.  The aforementioned <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/umputun/" class="user_link">Umputun</a> , by the way, in spite of the large number of podcast projects, approaches tags in good faith and, thus, is a good example for the rest. <br><br>  Why these tags at all?  There is the same name, you can add podcasts by subject or tape into folders and enjoy life.  Not satisfied with the name, rename the podcast groups en masse and that's it.  Such questions may arise from some who, most likely, have not tried to use tags.  After trying once, as they say, eat now.  Tags allow you to do everything the same, plus even more and faster and more convenient.  Structured information (with the normal design of tags) allows you to manipulate files as you please.  Sorting, ordering, sampling by any of the tags (and possibly a group of tags) speeds up the search for the right tracks.  In addition, it is convenient to use tags not only in software players, but also in hardware devices: players, radio tape recorders, various media players.  Normally designed tags will bring even more convenience when using the device and, accordingly, positive emotions when listening to content. <br><br>  From my experience I would say that I used to use only playlists from the small-scale pitch (I immediately refused the ‚Äúfile-folder‚Äù option), which brought me little joy: creating playlists, putting tracks there, organizing as I needed.  When I started using tags, then if the tags of the tracks are not in order, you edit them yourself en masse (there are good tools for this) and you start using files. <br>  What causes inconvenience to me, an ordinary podcast listener, in the "wrong" tags?  First, a general list, then I will explain. <br><ul><li>  Uninformativeness of individual tags, and the whole group of tags in general </li><li>  "Ugly" design </li><li>  Frequent change of podcast tags in the feed </li><li>  Well, the lack of tags at all </li></ul><br>  The lack of information is that the podcast title often includes information such as ‚ÄúPodcast No. 1‚Äù or ‚ÄúTrack 1‚Äù or information about the title of the podcast, and not the track.  In the case of "ugly design" I mean the unreasonable use of special characters.  The greatest evil of all is the frequent podcast tag change.  Since I listen to most of the podcasts from the <a href="http://podfm.ru/">podFM</a> resource, I can say that most authors do not have tags very well.  For example, due to the change of tags from release to release, podcasts from one tape are divided into several, according to those tags that have changed.  No need to fill all the tags, only the main ones, but deliberately. <br><ul><li>  The name of the entire tape is placed in the tag "Album" </li><li>  It is advisable to fill the tag "track number".  Let it be the track number in any period (week, month, year) or just a through counter </li><li>  The ‚ÄúTitle‚Äù tag, if it is different every time, is not necessary to fill it with thematic (which would be nice), but you can add the podcast and track numbers from the title </li><li>  Tag "Artist" well, it's naturally the podcaster itself </li><li>  It would be nice to fill the tags "Year" and "Style" </li><li>  And the last and important thing is to change the content of tags as rarely as possible, and even better to invent them once and never to change them (except for those that need to be changed, such as the tags ‚ÄúYear‚Äù, ‚ÄúTrack number‚Äù) </li></ul><br>  Many will say that it is long, tedious and uncomfortable.  And here and there, there is a good tag editor (free for non-commercial use) <a href="http://www.xdlab.ru/">Tag Scanner</a> with a Russian interface with all the necessary and convenient functionality.  In addition to him there is also a <a href="">Russian manual</a> .

      In principle, the editor is easy to master in half an hour and there is a detailed help on it, so I‚Äôll say briefly only about its capabilities.  On the MusicRenamer tab, you can rename a file from tags (or a set of tags) in parallel by modifying the name (case of letters, transliteration, etc.).  TagEditor is a tag editor directly.  TagProgressor is a batch work with tags, that is, a group filling of tags from any resources.  There are 4 options for retrieving tags: Internet, generating a tag from a file name, Retrieving a tag by manipulating other tags (for example, Title = Album + TrackNumber), retrieving tags from a file.  Also supported lyrics and graphics file.  That is, sticking a picture or textual content of a podcast is also possible.  All functions are performed fairly quickly with a preview of the result and the possibility of batch processing. <br><br>  Well, eavesdroppers can also use it to quickly edit tags.  And there is no need to re-write each time, just on the basis of a file that already has tags, you can fill the desired file with the same tags without effort. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/121825/">https://habr.com/ru/post/121825/</a></p>
