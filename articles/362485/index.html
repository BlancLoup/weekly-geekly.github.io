Prototypes are already driving, the equipment in terms of functionality resembles the equipment of fighter aircraft: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/de9/502/553/de95025530524516a56f68a5c6add21c.jpg" alt="image"><br>  This picture shows the <a href="">Advanced Driver Assistance System</a> (ADAS), intended, if not to replace the driver, then to simplify driving as much as possible. <br><br>  The ADAS functionality manages high beam switching, helps keep the car on the strip, implements adaptive cruise control, recognizes road signs, detects pedestrians / objects, prevents collisions, the interface implements intelligent 2D and 3D views of the environment, warns about collisions when reversing.  Additionally, it is possible to expand the system with an intelligent night vision system, a long-range radar, laser range finders, a system to replace the side mirrors.  It would seem that you can not think of anything else.  And it remains only to argue about the reliability of these systems and whether they should be trusted.  But in the leading Japanese laboratory of virtual reality, they found another direction to improve the safety of car traffic. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Perhaps you dreamed of a transparent car, the pillars and doors of which would not close the review?

      You are driving along the highway, see how the road is racing under your feet, the surrounding landscape is visible everywhere - in front, behind, to the right, to the left, above, below.  The blind spots created by the doors, pillars, the roof and the floor disappeared.  You are free, like a bird, and in full control of the environment.  You are like a pilot flying over the road. <br><br>  Researchers from the Japanese laboratories Tachi Laboratory / Inami Laboratory are thinking about the implementation of such a vehicle. <br><br>  Make a safe car out of glass is impossible.  Therefore, the researchers decided to install cameras on the outside of the car, and on the racks, doors, ceiling, rear seats and doors to display the image in accordance with the driver's point of view.  As a result, these obstacles will ‚Äúdisappear‚Äù. <br><br>  Due to the impossibility, insecurity and inexpediency of installing LCD screens instead of interior upholstery, they used projectors and a special reflective cloth in experimental cars. <br><br>  But the surface of the car can not be called a good screen - an uneven surface, and the head of the "spectator" is not always in the same place.  The image projected on an uneven surface will be distorted and the driver needs to correct this in order to see the image in the correct perspective. <br><br>  The solution was found with a new projector system that reflects light exactly back along the path that he had just taken.  Thus, you can design the correct image, in accordance with the correct position, directly on the "viewer", provided that the projector is close enough to the eyes of the "viewer".  In order to do this, the projector must be located on the head of the person (the ‚Äúspectator‚Äù) or the projector is installed on the ceiling of the cabin, and the sensors must track the movements and position of the head. <br><br>  To simplify the installation of the system in the finished car, without modifying its design, a semi-transparent mirror was used in the experimental vehicles, and the projector was placed on the bottom. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8fe/3bd/c96/8fe3bdc96e380f6dc6d6d2e00313eb4d.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The special retroreflective coating gives a bright reflected image. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/92a/5d7/5ea/92a5d75ea98c1d447b671aefcbd07133.png" alt="image"><br>  The coating consists of tiny balls refracting the light in the opposite direction.  Thanks to this method, the image is 100 times brighter, which is achieved using conventional screens.  Since the reflection occurs along the projection axis, there is no distortion of the image, even when the image is projected on a screen of complex shape. <br><br>  This system can also work as a kind of optical camouflage, if a person would wear clothes covered with retroreflective balls. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/33e/54a/5a6/33e54a5a6426a2904e9419db7b559e29.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a05/bc0/4c1/a05bc04c1d83ce544fb354076691167a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  This system allows you to project multiple images on one screen and thus the technology becomes available for all people in the car, and not just for one driver.  To do this, you need to install an additional number of projectors by the number of people in the car, but this would be a very cumbersome decision.  Therefore, a workaround was found with the addition of only an array of lenses to the existing ‚Äúprojector-screen‚Äù system.  Each element of the array works as a separate projector, thus creating a corresponding number of ‚Äúpoints of view‚Äù. <br><br>  The experimental system, even in so far reduced functionality, made the blind spots of the car visible to the driver, and the image is bright enough to be visible during the day. <br><br>  Then, a setup was created specifically for the Toyota Prius, which made the rear view almost transparent, so that the driver can see everything behind the vehicle when reversing.  In this case, the system consisted of one projector and six lenses, which allows the driver to feel natural in comparison with the system where the tracking of the movement of the driver's head was used.  The result is a panoramic view of the rear view area. <br><br>  The system can be applied, for example, in airplanes, in the cabins of cruise ships, manned astronautics and in any other areas where it is necessary to ‚Äúsee through walls‚Äù. <br><br>  Demonstration of the system: <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/gDk5HdGfuVI%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjUpSOjEYTohnEVlAuwVqg0Io0iQA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/362485/">https://habr.com/ru/post/362485/</a></p>
