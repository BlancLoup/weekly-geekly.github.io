About what Google did with XMPP</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  After the release of Google Hangout, the opinion that Google is closing XMPP has become popular on the Internet.  In fact, it is not.  However, such an impression could even have arisen from the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/180145/">previous article</a> , which contained hellish nothing in itself - at least details, one link (irrelevant - apparently, from OpenNet) to the Maemo forum (which, of course, has nothing to do with Google) comments of varying degrees of truthfulness. <br><br>  To understand what really happened, it was necessary to go through a lot of different discussions in various sources, which took time.  I live with the understanding that Google has been troubled with XMPP for several months now and at least a couple of them with the understanding that Google is losing interest in XMPP, so I gathered and structured all the information in one place. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2b6/032/fe8/2b6032fe84465e835d60184a511a850a.png">

    <h3>  What has Google done with XMPP?  Nothing. </h3><br>  Under the cat a complete collection of incidents and facts around Google Hangout, GTalk XMPP, s2s, user and expert assessments of the situation. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Chronology </h4><br>  Let's look at what is happening with GTalk from the first stage, when the first reports appeared that Google had closed S2S.  S2S (Server-to-Server) or server-to-server communication allows users of one jabber server to send messages to users of another jabber server.  This is the most important condition for server Orthodox, along with support for conferences, registration availability, and of course uptime. <br><br>  The s2s issues became public in April.  In the LiveJournal community of zhabberbovodov, a <a href="http://ru-jabber.livejournal.com/192721.html">discussion was</a> formed where people flooded about the closure of s2s with Google, and even on Habr√© an article appeared about the upcoming Google Babel - <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/176347">habrahabr.ru/post/176347</a> .  In the club Jabber <a href="">they wrote</a> on this topic a little more restrained. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ae1/6c5/eb6/ae16c5eb628558ac3da59cee9bf9a594.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Let us turn to the origins.  In fact, it all started back <a href="http://mail.jabber.org/pipermail/operators/2013-February/001571.html">in February</a> , when Google employees noticed spam activity from some servers and warned the community that they would limit the number of requests to add to the contact list from (all) other servers if requests continue to arrive: <br><br><blockquote>  Hi <br>  I‚Äôve been seeing lots of spammy domains, including jabberes.org, jabber.se, jabber-hosting.com and jabber.org.  If you‚Äôre not aware of the situation, <br>  <i>Per gustafsson</i> </blockquote><br><br>  You already know that this is exactly what happened <a href="http://mail.jabber.org/pipermail/operators/2013-March/001610.html">in the end</a> .  Google has enabled subscription request blocking.  As a true gentleman, Google also invited interested server owners to add to the white list.  Large server invitation mainly ignored.  Owners of several smaller ones have been added to the white list. <br><br>  For two months, requests to add to the contact list were available only from GTalk users, and it was not possible to request a subscription from a GTalk user.  In April, Google <a href="http://mail.jabber.org/pipermail/operators/2013-April/001672.html">screwed up spam filters</a> and removed the block. <br><br>  Quite a long lockout caused some amount of inconvenience and even myths. <br>  But if many wrote about blocking requests, for example, Opennet - <a href="http://www.opennet.ru/opennews/art.shtml%3Fnum%3D36409">www.opennet.ru/opennews/art.shtml?num=36409</a> - only the original source wrote about lifting the lock and restoring a full-featured <a href="https://www.fsf.org/blogs/sysadmin/google-reinstates-federated-instant-messaging">s2s; / sysadmin / google-reinstates-federated-instant-messaging</a> . <br><br><br><br><h3>  Total </h3><br>  <b>Why did you decide that Google has closed s2s?</b> <br>  Because in the announcement, federated domains were mentioned and affected. <br>  <b>Did Google close s2s?</b> <br>  No, did not close. <br>  <b>Findings?</b> <br>  Read the original sources is useful. <br>  And now let's move on to the Hangouts situation. <br><br><h6>  Google refuses XMPP? </h6><br><h5>  Google refuses XMPP? </h5><br><h4>  <b>Google refuses XMPP?</b> </h4><br><h3>  <b>WHAT REALLY HAPPENED?</b> </h3><br>  GOOGLE DIDN'T TURN OFF XMPP.  Google has released a new CLIENT for instant communication.  New messenger. <br>  One protocol.  The protocol is closed. <br>  Messenger functionality: sending messages, audio, video calls. <br><br><h3>  What do we have officially? </h3><br>  The primary source of information about abandoning XMPP in Google Hangouts is Nikhyl Singhal, head of communications services at Google, who, in an exclusive <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/5/15/4318830/inside-hangouts-googles-big-fix-for-its-messaging-mess">interview with TheVerge,</a> stated the following: <br><br><blockquote>  Talk, for example, was better, Singhal says.  "Talk. It‚Äôs a notion of creating something." that it helped pioneer. <br></blockquote><br><br>  From Nikhayl's words, it turns out that Google Talk was created to help communicate to corporate users, and while developing Hangouts at Google, they wanted to create something social and always accessible.  This was at variance with the Talk ideology and Google made the difficult decision to abandon the very open XMPP standard that it helped develop. <br><br>  To such a statement immediately raises a lot of questions.  Google‚Äôs participation in XMPP was not as impressive as Singhal was trying to present in his statement.  True, this is no longer a direct quotation of Singhal, but a statement by a journalist from TheVerge, so one cannot exclude an error in the wording.  But not like.  What was the fact?  GTalk was launched in August 2005.  In December of the same year, the library libjingle was published - an open implementation of the standard <a href="http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0166.html">XEP-0166: Jingle</a> .  Since then, they have practically not been involved in either GTalk or XMPP standards.  From standards-related, in 2006 S2S was solemnly launched - that's all.  Correct me if you can, but Google didn‚Äôt do any other work with XMPP standards on Google. <br>  Google had interesting initiatives in the form of a web chat in Gmail, transport in AOL (which at the same time allowed to work with ICQ until ICQ was sold at DST, now known as Mail.ru Group).  But this did not concern and did not help the <i>protocol, the</i> XMPP <i>standard</i> . <br><br>  Another possible explanation for the abandonment of XMPP is the most notorious spammy invites.  However, attempts to solve the problem through the creation / modification of standards and other-other by Google, too, was not noticed.  Moreover, the previous 10 years no one has encountered such a problem on an industrial scale.  And on the side of Google, too, did not notice.  That is, about this method of solving the problem worked with a bang: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/979/53d/4f4/97953d4f4cf638840363b3ae99478c70.png" alt="image"><br><br>  I exaggerate, of course, but nonetheless.  Spammers are quite successfully cut off at the server level with various monitoring tools, at the user level with bots, captcha and so on.  In especially serious cases, you can temporarily block s2s with the spammer server or close the registration. <br><br>  Thus, the mention of XMPP minuses from Google employees looks more like an attempt to justify in the eyes of the public the transition to Hangouts.  But the attempt is weak.  Of course, distribution across all Android devices is a much more significant factor and everyone understands that. <br><br>  Thanks to <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/bobuk/" class="user_link">bobuk</a> , we have a letter from Google stating that bots on AppEngine will no longer always work correctly - they will not be able to send messages to Hangout users.  But this concerns not only AppEngine bots, but all XMPP users. <br><br><blockquote> Hello from Google! <br>  Google App Engineers can be impacted by an upcoming product product release.  Google Talk.  The new service does not support XMPP. <br>  As a result, XMPP bots such as the App Engine.  There are two ways to keep your App Engine working: <br>  1) Your users may use XMPP.  App Engine XMPP service. <br>  2) It goes live.  For Google Apps domains.  End users and google app.  There is no change to their existing functionality, such as the App Engine XMPP bots.  XMPP based chat users in Gmail. <br>  Note: The XMPP clients have been affected by the App Engine XMPP service.  If you have any questions, comments, or concerns, please contact us at app-engine-xmpp-questions@googlegroups.com. <br>  <i>Sincerely, The Google App Engine Team</i> </blockquote><br><br>  Translated into Russian, this means: <br><br><blockquote>  2) End users will be asked to switch to the new [Hangouts] service when it is launched.  Please note that the launch date for Hangouts for Google Apps domains may vary.  End users and administrators of Google Apps domains will be able to refuse to switch to the new system.  If they refuse to go to Hangouts, Google Talk will continue to work for them and there will be no change in the current functionality, including the ability to exchange messages with XMPP bots App Engine. <br>  ... <br>  Please note that all the above changes do not have any impact on third-party XMPP clients that will continue to work with the App Engine XMPP service as usual. </blockquote><br>  The same is true not only for App Engine, but for any XMPP server and not only for bots, but also for regular Google Talk accounts. <br>  <b>For third-party XMPP clients, there has been no change in GTalk, and it will not happen in the near future.</b>  <a href="https://developers.google.com/talk/open_communications%3Fhl%3Dru">The official position</a> regarding third-party clients is also quite clear and has not changed - use any Jabber client.  Google just stopped making jabber client. <br><blockquote>  2. Which other clients can connect to the Google Talk service? <br>  Any client that supports Jabber / XMPP can connect to the Google Talk service.  Here is a list of popular <a href="https://developers.google.com/talk/popular_clients%3Fhl%3Dru">clients</a> . </blockquote><br><br><h3>  Questions and answers.  Why does everything work for me? </h3><br>  <b>Can I save GTalk somehow?</b> <br>  They say that you can put Hangouts from <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php%3Ft%3D2280940">apk</a> , then Talk will not be demolished.  I have a hangout from this apk anyway replaced the Talk.  Removing Hangouts from Google Play allows you to roll back to the GTalk pre-installed on Android.  In the new versions of Android, most likely there will be no GTalk and it will be more difficult to install it. <br>  <b>Do you have to dump from gmail.com (GTalk) to another Jabber server?</b> <br>  No, I do not have to.  Just make sure that neither you nor your friends are using Google anymore.  For reliability, you can use the same client - then everything will work exactly. <br>  If you need a web client, use open <a href="http://jappix.com/">source Jappix</a> . <br>  <b>And if you still throw, then where?</b> <br>  yandex.ru, qip.ru, jabber.ru/xmpp.ru <br>  to your domain - pdd.yandex.ru, hosted.im, <br>  to your server - ejabberd, prosody, openfire <br>  <i>Nota bene: With Yandex, everything is also not so rosy.</i>  <i>The last days of Yandex, and as a result of Jabber.ru, which is hosted nearby, also have problems in their work.</i>  <i>But do not wake yourself paranoid, this has happened before.</i>  <i>It should get better.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>However, Yandex Jabber is not interesting.</i>  <i>The only question is when they get tired and when they decide to close.</i>  <i>Of course, it will not be very soon.</i>  <i>But it is possible that all the same will be.</i> <br>  <b>How do Jabber fans communicate with Google Hangouts users?</b> <br>  Only through the client hangouts. <br>  If you are sent from Hangouts to your GTalk account, which is enabled through the jabber client, you will receive a message, but your contact will not receive a response.  Therefore, if you do not respond for a long time to a message sent from a jabber, you will have to either launch Hangouts and check whether the message was delivered at all. <br>  <b>Uncomfortable?</b> <br>  Inconvenient.  Try to use either only Hangouts, or only GTalk through jabber clients. <br>  <b>So, what is next?</b>  <b>From SMTP and POP3 do not think to refuse?</b> <br>  Yevgeny Vaganych, isn't it you?  Google changed the client and went to reinvent the wheel.  Well, OK.  XMPP continues to live and develop.  XMPP on Google continues to work.  What are these assaults? <br>  <b>I loved the gtalk mobile.</b>  <b>What to use next?</b> <br>  Under Android, perhaps, try IM +.  By the simplicity of the interface, it is most similar to the original GTalk. <br>  Alternatively, consider Jasmine IM and the recently updated QIP, depending on the requirements for functionality and design, respectively. <br>  And yet, by the way, Xabber is also an option. <br>  Under iOS - Talkonaut, IM +, Imo.im <br>  <b>Talk has been my main IM for many years now that Skype is starting to use ??</b> <br>  Skype or Viber, if you call in principle.  If it doesn't matter, use any normal jabber-client. <br>  <b>Third-party jabber-clients are still working, but they will probably be banned soon in this way.</b> <br>  I hope after this article it became clear that this is speculation. <br>  How can you prevent a jabber client from connecting to a jabber server?  Why would Google spend resources on it if XMPP doesn't have a basic solution? <br>  The question can only be whether the entire Jabber server will be closed.  You can speculate that they will close, and I - that they will not. <br>  Only an official announcement will resolve this dispute.  Let's wait.  I think we will have to wait another year at least.  So for now - use. <br><br><h3>  Google "well done" </h3><br>  In addition to all the inconveniences that obviously arise from the actions of Google, there is another side to the issue.  After all, Google Talk was the most awesome XMPP service!  GTalk's S2S did indeed fall off with various servers.  Sometimes there were problems with connections.  And all at least some major players in the voice claim that GTalk is under XMPP. <br><br>  Since its inception ... <br><ul><li>  The server does not send or receive messages if there is no authorization (subscription).  This is done in case of spam.  Those.  without mutual authorization, you will not be able to send and receive messages, and you will always be ‚ÄúOffline‚Äù with each other. <br></li><li>  Only two-way authorization is supported (one-way authorization is equivalent to the absence of authorization). <br></li><li>  When connecting the transports to your account on Google, there may be problems.  For example, the transport is ‚Äúlost‚Äù with a new login or is not connected automatically. <br></li><li>  Storage of bookmarks on the server is not supported. <br></li><li>  Jabber conferences are not supported. <br></li><li>  Private lists are not supported (list of those who see, those who do not see and are ignored) <br></li><li>  No user search for any data. <br></li><li>  The server does not allow you to change information about yourself by the client. <br></li><li>  The server does not allow changing the password from the account by the client. <br></li><li>  When you delete a contact from the contact list, it is deleted from the Google address book.  Also, when you delete a contact from your address book, it is removed from the contact list. <br></li><li>  The server, when connected, adds to the resource a random sequence of letters and numbers, because the official client does not support resources. <br></li></ul><br><br>  Anton Ugnich ( <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/ugnich/" class="user_link">ugnich</a> ), founder of the Jabber microblogging service Juick.com: <br>  About the death of Google Talk: <br><br><blockquote>  Well, [if soon] it is not necessary [will] to support this pitiful similarity of XMPP, one less headache.  <a href="http://juick.com/ugnich/2360253">juick.com/ugnich/2360253</a> </blockquote><br><br><blockquote>  Philip Kulin ( <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/schors/" class="user_link">schors</a> ), DiPhost: <br>  Google is really well done.  I was upset and stopped here.  Well, he did not draw free service, so he left and does not interfere with commercial services.  The same XMPP is not clear at all what lives.  For more than 10 years of its existence, nobody really supports it.  There are standards, but no intelligent implementations have arisen.  Vaughn, Juick - then so he is not this, then this.  So this is an opportunity for us, brothers and sisters, to make our standard, for students to create clients and servers for it, for a business to sell it.  Maybe our new standard will be a hundred times better than stillborn streaming XML. </blockquote><br><br>  This proposal, of course, should be taken with a bit of humor, but the message is generally true: despite the fact that XMPP is a very rich and open protocol in theory, it should be supported by practice.  The implementation of clients and servers should change, or the protocol as a whole can be replaced in the future with something more dynamic.  After all, there is always such a guy: <br><br><img src="http://habr.habrastorage.org/comment_images/e1e/960/02b/e1e96002b5abca7c2355bb45a7b51f40.png" alt="image"><br><br>  I am very impressed with the position of the Xabber developers, who have crystallized in the last three months: <br><br><blockquote>  GoogleReader news reminded us of the #GoogleWave death.  We are not sure that Xtmp will survive in gtalk.  <a href="https://twitter.com/Xabber_XMPP/status/312177093846904832">March 14th</a> <br>  We assume once #GTalk is no longer compatible with #XMPP.  This will be the day we stop using it.  "Don't be evil", is it?  <a href="https://twitter.com/Xabber_XMPP/status/324242987582365697">April 16th</a> <br>  We'd better run #kickstart to create a #xmpp client that implements all the things from the Hangouts based on XEPs <a href="https://twitter.com/Xabber_XMPP/status/337245268426756096">on May 22</a> <br></blockquote><br><br>  The problem is that the development of the XMPP itself also needs a lot of work to make it comfortable and versatile.  This is quite complicated and none of the end-user client developers are doing this.  And those who are engaged are far from the mass user.  XMPP doesn't have a development vector right now.  So, they do something little by little in standards and nothing is introduced that we could use in life.  Interesting standards are adopted, but their implementations are not distributed in popular Jabber clients and therefore new functions cannot be used to communicate with an arbitrary interlocutor.  There is a segmentation on clients. <br><br><h3>  XMPP vs Hangouts </h3><br><blockquote>  Hangouts does not support XMPP federation.  At all.  Fundamentally.  And not going. <a href="http://juick.com/2360266"></a></blockquote>  He's worse.  And then, who knows what the hangouts have inside?  Perhaps, at some point, Google will switch to some standard protocol again :) Never say never. <br><br>  It is necessary to distinguish the Hangouts messenger, GTalk messenger and Google Talk jabber service.  C2S in Hangouts is supported, S2S is not. <br>  Nothing happened to the GTalk jabber servers. <br>  But GTalk's jabber clients have been replaced with a client for the new protocol, and in this sense, Google really refuses XMPP.  Not technically, but ideologically.  Google deprives the XMPP community of its support and starts moving in the direction of the Skype-like model.  Including focusing on sound and video. <br><br><h4>  Cross-server Hangouts and XMPP </h4><br>  Hangouts -&gt; Gtalk <br>  Gtalk -&gt; Hangouts <br><br>  youserver.org &lt;-&gt; Gtalk <br>  Gtalk &lt;-&gt; Gtalk <br><br>  youserver.org X Hangouts <br>  Hangouts X youserver.org <br><br><h3>  PostGool Era </h3><br>  1.
