According to the data obtained, fat-losing fat men maintain abnormally slow metabolism even a few years after a sharp weight loss. <br><br>  Scientists tracked the history of 14 participants of the TV show, and found that a sharp weight loss led to a significant decrease in the rate at which the body spends calories during rest.  A similar condition persisted for six years after losing weight.  This leads to the fact that it becomes harder for people to maintain a normal weight - almost all participants returned or approached their former weight. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In the <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/enhanced/doi/10.1002/oby.21538">description of the work,</a> scientists hypothesize that the body specifically slows down its metabolism in order to return the weight to some constant value that it is trying to maintain.  If the work is recognized, this hypothesis will explain why it is so difficult to keep weight after getting rid of extra pounds.

      The metabolism indicators were removed from the participants immediately before participating in the shooting, immediately after the shooting and six years after the show.  For 30 weeks, during which the show was filmed, the average participant lost 64 kg.  At the beginning of the shooting, the participants spent 2607 ¬± 649 kcal a day.  By the end of the process, this rate dropped to 1996 ¬± 358 kcal per day.  And the more the participant lost weight, the more slowed his metabolism. <br><br>  Six years after the show, only one participant had less weight than at the end of the competition.  The remaining 13 gained kilograms back - five of them came very close to their original figures.  Still, the metabolic rate they have remained low - on average, 1903 ¬± 466 kcal per day, which is about 500 kcal per day less than the average person should have in their volumes. <br><br>  The researchers noted that during <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2596%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D1%2583%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BE%25D1%2587%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B5_%25D1%2588%25D1%2583%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5">gastric bypass surgery</a> , in which the working volume of this organ to accelerate saturation significantly decreases, the metabolic rate does not change.  This operation really helps to lose weight especially to problem patients, and in this case there is no any special weight value that the body would seek. <br><br>  The Research Institute for Diabetes and Kidney and Digestive Diseases is a member of the US National Institutes of Health.  This is an institution of the United States Department of Health.  It is the primary center of the US government responsible for research into health and biomedical issues.  It consists of 27 institutes and research centers. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/393567/">https://habr.com/ru/post/393567/</a></p>
