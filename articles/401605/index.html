  <section class="page js-page"><h1>When the brand does not keep the word or review of the Russian registrar AdvoCam-FD One</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Two years ago, I wrote a review of the budget DVR <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/advocam/blog/242871/">AdvoCam-FD Black-GPS</a> .  In the article I spoke about why when choosing an inexpensive autocamera it is important to look at the brand, which functions and features of automobile ‚Äúblack boxes‚Äù I consider redundant.  And why is AdvoCam-FD Black-GPS - the optimal state employee in all respects (at the end of 2016 it cost 6,500 rubles).  The model has so far acquired the status of almost legendary - two years later, it still enjoys enormous popularity in Russia and the CIS countries.  I dare to suggest that even in 2018, the device will not be removed from production.  Meanwhile, AdvoCam realized that it would be nice to meet the needs of motorists in a lower price niche.  And they released quite a budget AdvoCam-FD One for 4,500 rubles. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/43e/189/2fb/43e1892fb70546c78b1cc7bc49c5dd94.jpeg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I give reason to rumble evil tongues.  Not a year ago, a well-known registrar expert Alexander Shub published a huge Talmud sponsored by AdvoCam a year ago, entitled <a href="http://mobile-review.com/articles/2015/adv-advocam.shtml">‚ÄúHow to choose a DVR 2015: the biggest FAQ for the average customer on the Internet</a> . <a href="http://mobile-review.com/articles/2015/adv-advocam.shtml">‚Äù</a>  A large part of the material was devoted to the reasons for which you certainly can never buy a quality recorder for less than 5,000 rubles.  That is, the registrar can, in principle, be able to buy, but it will not be of high quality.  I quote: <i>"High-quality assembly, competent quality control of manufactured devices, decent components - all this today makes the price of a NORMAL recorder not less than 5,000 rubles</i> . <i>"</i>  Later in the article <a href="http://www.mobile-review.com/articles/2016/adv-advocam2.shtml">‚ÄúFrom Russian for Russian conditions: a review of the current line of domestic DVRs AdvoCam‚Äù the</a> following was said: ‚ÄúAdvoCam never released and does not plan to release recorders of the category‚Äú for a couple of kopecks ‚Äùwith a price tag below 5,000 rubles.  Such devices are always trade-offs not so much in terms of the quality of shooting, as in the quality of workmanship and reliability. ‚Äù  AdvoCam-FD One, which appeared in the fall of 2016, did not at first break the idyll and cost 4,990 rubles, but by the time this material was written, it had treacherously ‚Äúsank‚Äù to the official 4,500 rubles. <br><br>  So, what should AdvoCam-FD One attract users whose budget does not exceed 5,000 rubles?  According to Russian developers, this device is the most thoughtful budget registrar of the end of 2016.  They say there are no unnecessary functions - the model abandoned all additional ‚Äúbuns‚Äù.  But at the same time, the quality of shooting is at the level of models for 7-8 thousand rubles, and there are also a number of interesting features.  Well, sort of a 2 megapixel webcam feature.  But the main thing is a truly huge battery for 40 minutes of autonomous shooting - there is no such brand in any other registrar: neither expensive nor cheap.

      Introductory information taken into account.  And now we will understand more. <br><br><h2>  AdvoCam-FD One Specifications </h2><br><blockquote>  Matrix: 2 Mp, CMOS, 1 / 2.7 "" (SOI JX-F02); <br>  Viewing angles (diagonal): 150 degrees; <br>  Elements (lenses) in the lens, material: five lenses, coated glass; <br>  Aperture: F / 2.0; <br>  Compression, video format: H.264 / MOV; <br>  Video processor: Generalplus 2159; <br>  Resolution / recording speed: 720p (1280 * 720p, 30 fps);  1080p (1920 * 1080p, 30 fps); <br>  Memory Cards: microSD (up to 32GB); <br>  Record activation: manually, automatically when the ignition is turned on; <br>  Video recording: cyclic, segments of 2, 3, 5 minutes.

Therefore, I will immediately write about the main thing.  About the fact for which most buyers actually acquire the DVR. <br><br>  As the theater begins with a hanger, so the study of the ‚Äúprecursors‚Äù of one or another level of shooting should be started with a lens.  I remember in my time many materials stated that only metal lens holders were used in AdvoCam.  We all remember the result - in 2015, the material <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/advocam/blog/267566/">‚ÄúI</a> offer an <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/advocam/blog/267566/">official apology: about the lens holders in AdvoCam recorders‚Äù</a> appeared on Geektimes.  It turned out that the erroneous thesis became the "illegitimate child" of the report from the own production of Videmax company (owner of AdvoCam) in the city of Aleksandrov, Vladimir region.  There, in Aleksandrov, by the way, all AdvoCam models are developed and then tested for resistance to extreme temperatures and shaking.  So, in the report it was mentioned that in all professional video surveillance systems metal holders are installed.  In the future, this statement was for some reason spread by journalists and on AdvoCam models. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/db9/ee3/15e/db9ee315e4f947f497720a3336b2cd0d.jpeg"><br><br>  Therefore, I specifically clarified with an AdvoCam engineer so that I would not be able to shell out AdvoCam-FD8 Gold GPS for 10,000 rubles in favor of one of the attentive readers.  Regardless of the price in any DVR brand used lenses with glass lenses.  Compared to plastic, they are deprived of a chance to dim with time (with a decrease in image clarity), or even to go cracked due to constant temperature drops. <br><br>  In the budgetary AdvoCam-FD One there is a ‚Äúpeephole‚Äù with five glass lenses.  Even more interesting is that the aperture of the lens is F / 2.0, although in registrars up to 10,000 rubles this value in most cases "floats" around F / 2.2-2.8.  I think the audience at Geektimes is quite advanced and understands that the smaller the aperture value, the more high-aperture lens, and hence the higher quality of shooting in low light conditions we get. <br><br>  The matrix and processor are the reasons why AdvoCam-FD One was born, in principle.  There is a more or less well-established set of major components on the recorder market.  For example, OmniVision and Sony arrays, Ambarella and Novatek processors.  Experiments and the search for new interesting "pieces of iron" with a lower price can be afforded by a few companies simply because of the qualifications of developers.  AdvoCam was not afraid to carefully examine the component market and to take the little-known Generalplus 2159 processor and the SOI JX-F02 matrix as the base of its new product.  I don‚Äôt say much about the processor - according to the developers, its power is enough for stable trouble-free operation of the recorder.  And the final image processing algorithms are not inferior to the ‚Äúfavorite‚Äù of the bulk of Novatek 96650 state employees. Of interesting things, there is no hardware HDR support, but WDR technology deals with leveling the brightness of the frame (which is useful both at night and during the day). <br><br>  CMOS-sensor is much more interesting for its characteristics.  On Geektimes already published this illustrative picture, I will bring it again. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/225/cf8/ed9/225cf8ed981a42d28920c24119524aa1.jpeg"><br><br>  As you probably know, in the photo, that in video equipment, the happiness of high-quality shooting in low light conditions is not measured at all by the sensor megapixels.  In the first place - the physical size of the matrix and the pixel size, obtained with a given resolution of the matrix.  So, in fact in SOI JX-F02 with a physical size of CMOS-sensor 1 / 2.7 "and a resolution of 2 megapixels, we get the size of each pixel at 3 x 3 microns.  Whereas in a 1/3 ‚Äù4-megapixel matrix typical for a budget recorder, the pixel will be 1.9 times smaller - 2.2 x 2.2 Œºm.  And the larger each cell, the more light it can receive and show excellent shooting at night, at dusk or in cloudy weather. <br><br>  As I mentioned <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/advocam/blog/283168/">here</a> , on average, in AdvoCam-FD One, the maximum readability distance of state numbers is provided at a distance of 15 meters by day and 10 meters by night.  For the most picky - it does not mean that always and under any circumstances you will get these numbers.  For example, at night with the difference in the speed of movement of cars at least 5-10 km / h, no registrar in the world will allow you to see the license plate, in its place you will see only a pixel "porridge".  If we talk about competitors, then in the same price range you will get, at best, up to 10 meters during the day and up to 5 at night.  Either in the dark there will be a completely ‚Äúnoisy‚Äù picture without a chance to look at the state number. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/444/a82/27f/444a8227ff64418eb530aab12b54c6f0.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bda/d0d/99b/bdad0d99baef4f1ea8a60fb59f1d2439.jpeg"><br><br>  During the day the recorder demonstrates a natural high-quality picture.  In contrast to, say, Mio from state employees, the creators of AdvoCam-FD One do not seek to programmatically embellish reality with the help of ‚Äúbattered‚Äù contrast and color rendition.  The only ‚Äúsinner‚Äù I have noticed is periodic white balance errors, which occasionally disappear into blue and often gives a greenish tint.  I remember that similar corporate handwriting is present in budget cameras on the super popular NovaTek 65590 processor - there is a steady systematic bias in cold shades.  It will be interesting to look at the end of 2017 - will any of the reputable developers try to follow the example of AdvoCam and also make an affordable device based on Generalplus 2159 and SOI JX-F02. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OpnOK3mPkxU" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UUoj0e0MfHY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/389/6f0/acb/3896f0acbbc84b9f9b44e8459cc52d5c.jpeg"><br><br>  Already there are first attempts among the Chinese, but completely inconclusive - a typical example of what is described in the article <a href="http://mobile-review.com/articles/2016/camcorders.shtml">‚ÄúHarmful Tips: How to Develop a Bad Car DVR‚Äù</a> .  That is, the hardware was tied up, but they could not configure and make it work normally.  For example, a typical review on such a ‚Äúraw‚Äù recorder model: <i>‚ÄúThe native firmware is raw, the white balance is disgusting, the picture constantly goes into red, is briefly treated by rebooting, there is a loop recording, the WDR mode does not work, the battery holds about 4-5 minutes to a full charge (after a week it degraded to 4-5 seconds), the sound is disgusting, only hum and cod are heard on the record. ‚Äù</i> <br><br>  At night in AdvoCam-FD One, everything is also in order.  What I did NOT notice: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúNoise‚Äù.  Large pixels of the matrix clearly allow the recorder not to experience a shortage in the rate of conversion of analog information into digital. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Clear deviation to one side or the other of white balance.  There are no special errors at night.  Unlike competitors, who for even 15,000 rubles can, in case of insufficient illumination, frankly tinker and mix up a rich yellow tone, or a greenish one. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Exposure errors and uneven brightness across the frame.  Apparently, not least the support of WDR for the elimination of glares makes itself known. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mFEf2Ct2ncI" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BW_KbTuSYBg" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c55/904/746/c5590474679f464aaa10c0e085204edf.jpeg"><br><br>  By the way, the viewing angle of the lens AdvoCam-FD One is 150 degrees diagonally, in my opinion - the optimal value.  Nevertheless, at 170 degrees, one has to obviously sacrifice the distance of reading state numbers, and in the case of 120 degrees, the viewing angle is too narrow, not too suitable for city conditions.  This is because you have two or three lanes on the highway, and in the city the number of lanes increases two to three times, not to mention the sidewalks.  And it is highly desirable that as much as possible ‚Äúmoving around‚Äù get into the frame in order to increase the probability of recording the most complete picture of the incident on video. <br><br>  A small fly in the ointment.  150 degrees diagonally is still quite a wide angle, so from a distance of about a hundred meters tall objects at the edges of the frame can begin to ‚Äúbow‚Äù.  This does not essentially affect the quality of the image, the question is purely aesthetic.  By the way, in much more expensive Ambarella A7 processors, this problem was solved by the ‚Äúalignment‚Äù technology of Dewarp.  Here, the natural distortions introduced by the lens, such as curved buildings on the verges, are eliminated (that is, ‚Äústraightened‚Äù) by software processing. <br><br>  Initially, the Russian developers of AdvoCam claimed (and continue to do so) that the novelty in terms of shooting is not inferior to the middle class recorders for 7-8 thousand rubles.  Is it so?  As for me, you can unequivocally state that AdvoCam-FD One wins dry in terms of the quality of recording from state employees at the cost of up to 6-7 thousand rubles, not to mention the army of non-registrars with price tags around 4-5 thousand rubles.  Then everything is not so clear - in a higher price range (from 8,000) there is enough of both frank Chinese hack, and very decent copies.  For example, the South Korean <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/bvc_trade/blog/282434/">ThinkWare F50</a> is sold for 9 thousand rubles.  And this is a registrar who ‚Äúin the dark time of day produces a picture at the level of top‚Äú Chinese ‚Äùat the price of 12-15 thousand rubles‚Äù. <br><br><h2>  Settings, features </h2><br>  With the main thing - video filming - figured out, it's time to explore other features of the device.  Despite the low price, the developers did not let ‚Äúunder the knife‚Äù in general all the minor features and save on anything.  The good news number one is that the autonomy of AdvoCam-FD One will be envied by another flagship.  The battery capacity is 550 mAh, which is impressive against the background of 150-250 mAh, even in devices more expensive than 7-8 thousand rubles.  Therefore, if on average other registrars offer autonomy in the region of 5-15 minutes, then AdvoCam-FD One reaches a mark of 40 minutes declared by the manufacturer.  My actual figures turned out to be in the range of up to 45 minutes, which is basically normal. <br><br>  Although what is normal there.  Correct me if I'm wrong, but actually this is a new world record among all DVRs!  In my opinion, especially AdvoCam-FD One will come in handy in car travels - you don‚Äôt need to take out a smartphone once again to ‚Äúdocument‚Äù something interesting. <br><br>  According to the engineer AdvoCam, he managed to fix 50 minutes, but to officially indicate the limit values ‚Äã‚Äã- more expensive.  Who knows how and under what conditions the registrar will be used with subsequent claims to the brand.  I note that the company is not very cautious.  For example, the domestic brand TrendVision for several of its models with an actual autonomy of 30 minutes indicated the work for only 15 minutes.  It was rather funny after that to read the materials of ‚Äúcompetent‚Äù observers who did not bother to conduct a real test and took the value of an autonomous survey from the table of characteristics. <br><br>  The good news is number two - AdvoCam-FD One can work in 2-megapixel webcam mode for a computer.  No fuss with the drivers, you just need to connect the model to the PC.  It seems to me that the function is more than claimed.  Leaving the recorder in the car in your absence is not a safe occupation, so it's best to take the camera with you home.  And there - you never know who from friends or distant relatives you want to chat on Skype. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/05e/b41/118/05eb41118ce34dbb96824511bf1523df.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/512/ebf/4c2/512ebf4c27dd44b89db9e1a6055f3da0.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4eb/a33/5e8/4eba335e8b3f401e8b7fae2760dd7c08.jpeg"><br><br>  For an optimal picture, it is better to install the camera approximately at an arm's length from the face.  Closer - there will be no focus.  After all, first of all, AdvoCam-FD One is a DVR that should provide the highest maximum readability of state numbers as possible. <br><br>  It did not go without a G-sensor, which, under circumstances similar to an accident, keeps the current record as an emergency one.  That is, it excludes from cyclic shooting and does not allow overwriting with newer rollers.  As always, if the camera tries to take every bump on the road for an incident, you should reduce the sensitivity of the sensor in the settings. <br><br>  Actually, the settings in AdvoCam-FD One are organized in the most convenient and logical way.  I do not like when all the options are dumped into one continuous list.  Sometimes while scrolling through 15-20 points (and 3-4 settings are displayed on the screen) to the desired ... AdvoCam arrived in the most logical way, the set of settings varies depending on the current mode.  In the case of video, we get a list with a choice of recording resolution, length of clips, etc.  When photographing - a bunch of parameters like stabilization, serial shooting or the choice of ISO.  In both modes, the second, ‚Äúuniversal‚Äù tab with the date / time settings, language selection, card formatting and other features remains available. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a12/905/3c8/a129053c89f24a0f9dfd910bcead4f33.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f43/0c5/37c/f430c537c39a4318b932d1e33871a9af.jpeg"><br><br>  I note that all the settings that are really important for the registrar are present, but at the same time the menu did not overload.  For example, for a video exposure is available, but the choice of white balance, contrast, sharpness would clearly be superfluous for a wide range of users. <br><br><h2>  Appearance </h2><br>  The model is made in the popular form factor of almost square casing, where the main part of the buttons is located behind the screen.  As a corporate touch, AdvoCam specialists made a high-quality soft-touch coating, so it‚Äôs pleasant to hold the recorder in your hand, and the resistance to fingerprints and other dirt is high. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b8e/392/f92/b8e392f9273c4775a5906d1d8a2f860d.jpeg"><br><br>  The developers did not stint on a large insert of ground metal in front.  The element performs not only a decorative function, it is intended to attract the attention of people from the outside and signal the ongoing video shooting with its sparkles.  In this regard, I do not support lovers of the most secretive installation.  Yes, in the parking lot, this theoretically will reduce the likelihood of an autopsy being opened by thieves (in fact, there isn‚Äôt - who needs it, carefully looks and finds the camera).  But the rest of the time, any motorist directing to you, a traffic police officer, just a passer-by should know that all their actions are recorded on camera.  In this sense, the design solution of the AdvoCam-FD One case is seen as an additional advantage of the Russian camera. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/aa6/046/bc7/aa6046bc7a054ae0bbffaa8a6faba7f6.jpeg"><br><br>  The rest of the case is nothing special, there are also slots from the front.  Both the top and bottom have perforations for better air circulation and cooling of the inside of the recorder. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2c5/7f9/fda/2c57f9fda649426d969613ff76e17ddc.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bf7/d64/a61/bf7d64a615084531a57acf87bd1e05ec.jpeg"><br><br>  To the left of the lens is a miniUSB port for powering and connecting to a computer, as well as an HDMI connector for outputting a picture to a TV or monitor. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/551/833/77c/55183377ccbc442cb01d052f983774f1.jpeg"><br><br>  On the right is a microSD slot with support for cards up to 32 GB, above - the power button, it is also responsible for the quick off / on the display. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3b9/7ab/3c7/3b97ab3c7d8b4f1aa4f10d1761948c5f.jpeg"><br><br>  All the remaining keys are located under the 2.4-inch display.  In general, management is organized according to the ‚ÄúOne Touch‚Äù corporate principle, when each button allows you to quickly perform a particular function.  For example, manually assign an alarm tag to the file, turn on / off the microphone. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5a4/bf7/fec/5a4bf7fec6ec4205813d3a33178cd7fc.jpeg"><br><br>  With the bracket in AdvoCam did not reinvent the wheel, about the same holder is used in many budget recorders. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cdf/3ad/fa6/cdf3adfa6e204d5d858a3b74a3b5984b.jpeg"><br><br>  The driver can adjust the tilt of the camera and fix the position of the clip.  At the same time, without any screws, the turn of the recorder is available at any time in the direction or immediately to 180 degrees. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e56/38a/081/e5638a081cd74c85ba8cc65d9abacffa.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a53/79e/cd5/a5379ecd591e4299995d6428f65e46e7.jpeg"><br><br>  Ideally, I would like to see the power supply through the mount, but alas - it is the prerogative of AdvoCam models that are more expensive than 7 thousand rubles.  To its credit, AdvoCam-FD One will note that here the plug of the power cable is L-shaped, and therefore it immediately turns the wire up to the ceiling.  For some reason, very often other companies ignore this moment, as a result, the plug sticks out 2-3 cm to the side of the camera, and then the cable breaks up or down. <br><br><h2>  Contents of delivery </h2><br>  AdvoCam recorder boxes have always been highly informative, AdvoCam-FD One is no exception.  So, in the plate it is specified in detail, which rollers of which total duration fit on a map of a certain volume, and from the rear describes the functions of all keys of the model. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9d5/2f6/da7/9d52f6da77f04f1086c00b29b9cc4ed9.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cf0/fa8/aff/cf0fa8affb2c45728f64dd5bedb40911.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/36e/d23/f8c/36ed23f8cda94136b848492ea9285162.jpeg"><br><br>  The box contains a cigarette lighter power adapter, a miniUSB cable, a user manual, and five hooks for neat cabling in the cabin.  The hooks on the 3M-velcro pleasantly surprised, most often they are not something that with the budget, and even complete with cameras of medium and high price segments can not be found. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b14/d8e/b8f/b14d8eb8fcaf48ea988acdf624bd1385.jpeg"><br><br><h2>  Conclusion </h2><br>  AdvoCam-FD One is an example of how profitable a fresh look at seemingly established things can be.  Russian developers have abandoned the standard ‚Äúhardware‚Äù and managed to find and ‚Äúmake friends‚Äù with such an inexpensive matrix and processor, which, with a model price of 4,500 rubles, give out a picture at almost twice the price of more expensive recorders.  And even more so AdvoCam-FD One surpasses the quality of shooting direct competitors in the budget segment.  Despite the rejection of a number of additional options such as LDWS / FCWS, GPS-GLONASS, speed-cams, etc., the models have something to boast in addition to excellent recording.  The device can act as a 2-megapixel webcam, and therefore saves you 2-3 thousand rubles for the purchase of this accessory for the computer.  Also, the device boasts a record autonomy of 40 minutes versus 5-15 minutes for the absolute majority of recorders.  As I already mentioned, it will be extremely interesting to see if other companies will succeed in surpassing AdvoCam-FD One - so far the most thoughtful budget recorder of the end of 2016 and even the beginning of 2017. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/401605/">https://habr.com/ru/post/401605/</a></p>
