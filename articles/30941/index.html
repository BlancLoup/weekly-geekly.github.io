I was often asked about the future of Web 2.0 - is it a bubble, and when will something else take its place?  Fortunately, we recently worked out this topic quite well at O'Reilly Radar, so I was able to clearly state the picture of the future.  It looks like this ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  2004: The emergence of Web 2.0 and the corresponding term. <br><br>  2006: ‚ÄúYou‚Äù (ordinary user) is named ‚Äúperson of the year‚Äù by Time magazine in honor of Web 2.0. <br><br>  2007: We are here now.

      2008: Firefox 3.14159 is released (these geeks in Mozilla are simply unrecoverable, so a real war will begin between them and developers will be dismissed - all because of a dispute whether you can call the new browser PiFox; but in the end they will stop on PyreFox).  In this version, <b>offline support for Ajax applications</b> will appear.  People will want to call it ‚ÄúWeb 3.0‚Äù, but the term was previously given to the Semantic Web, so the blogosphere quickly decides to call it Web 2.86, but the point will soon be lost (to the displeasure of the purists) and the media will burst around the term <b>Web 286</b> . <br><br>  2009: Semantic Web researchers will develop a deductive calculator that automatically solves arbitrary problems using mathematical knowledge encoded on the Web.  The new tool will be happy to be used by schoolchildren to do their homework, but the calculator will require that the conditions of the problem be expressed through TeX markup.  The only documents in the new format will be obscure documents from one Russian university, which specializes in the geometric expression of the results of information theory in Riemannian spaces.  It will become clear that Web 3.0 has not yet arrived. <br><br>  2009: The fascination of widgets will bring Firefox 4 into the operating system and become a new cross-platform platform for widgets.  Out of respect for the developers of the Semantic Web, who still persist in their research, it will be decided to leave the term "Web 3.0" for them.  Bloggers will skip this number and stop at <b>Web 3.1</b> . <br><br>  2010: The developers of the Semantic Web released a new XML format, which was proclaimed the last step to Web 3.0. <br><br>  2010: The rapid spread of the popularity of complex user interfaces built on Ajax, Flex, etc., will make web developers louder and louder about the need for standardization.  The W3C consortium will not be able to solve this problem, but as a result of consensus, APIs and widgets from the most well-known Ajax sets will be chosen, which will be implemented in Firefox 5, as well as, a few months later, in IE 12. Because this is 100% consistent with the vision Internet operating system "Tim O'Reilly, then he will be able to convince everyone that the best name for this is <b>Web 95</b> . <br><br>  2011: Researchers at the Semantic Network will create a children's game to replenish the online database of RDF objects.  Despite the fact that this system was proclaimed the key to the Web 3.0, but as a result, nothing will happen except the world's largest base of Pokemon. <br><br>  2012: Launch of the secret Mozilla project: a universal thin client, a fully loadable platform built on the basis of Linux, whose sole task is to launch a web server.  The developers' war around whether the client should work on GNOME or KDE will end with the release of two versions, which will damage the popularity of the program at first.  However, soon two projects will merge to demonstrate their superiority over Windows.  Headlines will appear in the newspapers ‚Äú2011 was the year of the Linux desktop‚Äù, and the GNODE environment (this will be the name of the combined graphics subsystem) built into Firefox 6 will conquer the world.  <b>Web 98</b> appears in the headers. <br><br>  2013: A long time will pass without significant innovations.  During this period, Firefox 6 will achieve almost complete dominance in the market, and then a powerful wave of malicious software written specifically for it will flood.  The Mozilla development team, torn between closing holes and implementing new features, will fail when trying to complete Firefox 7 on time. You will find a way out to buy Opera and release it on OpenSolaris as ‚ÄúEnterprise-ready Firefox‚Äù.  The resulting fragmentation of the web (which everyone has already forgotten since IE 13 disappeared from the market, and Microsoft in 2012 turned into a service company) will lead to chaos.  Mozilla promises, but it will never release the portability tool announced under the name ‚ÄúNo Trouble‚Äù - in their honor this era will remain in history as the <b>Web NT</b> . <br><br>  2013: Semantic Web researchers will release a new RDF database for Java 6 Enterprise Edition (‚ÄúRaging Marmot‚Äù).  There will be parties in honor of the advent of the Web 3.0. <br><br>  2015: Mozilla will kill Opera's line, and integrates a couple of features that you especially like into Firefox.  To regain user loyalty, Mozilla will spend a lot of money on designers and interface specialists.  So much attention to these issues will lead to the emergence of <b>Web XP</b> . <br><br>  2020: After years of development and anti-malware, Mozilla will decide to drastically revise the Firefox 7 feature set to the downside.  They will skip the seventh version and release Firefox X with RSS support for blogs, IM, twitter and the new messaging system ‚Äúcrack‚Äù, which will update the information from friends every two seconds, and when you work, it will blink in yellow in 64 points on black background.  The crack system will be so addictive that sales of Firefox X will soar above the roof (Mozilla Corporation will order over the years trying to release Firefox 7, which is why it will have to take money for Firefox X).  Having received huge revenues from the sale of Firefox X and from the IPO, Mozilla will open a charitable foundation to fight the spread of disease, hunger and lightheadedness in the third world countries.  After six months, the number of victims among crack users (they could not tear themselves away from the screen and died of exhaustion) would attract public attention and affect the stock market, but the gin was already released from the bottle.  As the corpses accumulate on the streets, there will be less and less people of intellectual work in the world.  Humanity will return to hunting and gathering.  Civilization will collapse, and the priests proclaim the onset of a new era, free from offices and cities, they will talk about the coming of a world in which humanity lives among hilly green fields and under a sky filled with clouds.  In honor of this vision of the world, the <b>Web Vista</b> will be called. <br><br>  2022: The last researcher of the Semantic Network will announce the creation of a program that can solve sudoku puzzles formulated in RDF.  And only the breakdown of the last laptop on the planet (Pentium military type of 2008 release) will prevent the onset of <b>Web 3.0</b> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/30941/">https://habr.com/ru/post/30941/</a></p>
