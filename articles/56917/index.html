Here, of course, we are talking about <em>our</em> classes, since binding to the framework or third-party libraries is quite a normal thing, and does not need testing (although how to say ...). <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So, a problem has arisen: how to test a class, but instead of using other classes they use to put some objects that themselves do nothing (for example, do not write data to the database), but at the same time return the expected values ‚Äã‚Äãor throw out exceptions?  The solution to this problem is given by the mock frameworks that help us create these cunning fake objects or ‚Äúmocks‚Äù (from English <em>mock</em> - a copy, imitation).  Let's use the <a href="http://www.typemock.com/">TypeMock</a> library and see how these ‚Äúmocks‚Äù work in action. <br><br>  What do we need to use mocks?  Three things - Visual Studio, TypeMock, and a suitable framework for unit testing (I'll use MbUnit).  Well, the desire to study it all. <br><br><h4>  The first steps </h4><br>  First, a small script.  Suppose that I have a system of accounting for workings which considers how much I owe to an employee.  It looks like this: 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
    <pre> public class Worker
 {
   private List &lt;int&gt; workHours {get;  set;  }
   public int GetTotalHoursWorked () {return workHours.Sum ();  }
 }
 public class Payroll
 {
   public int CalculatePay (Worker worker)
   {
     // pay everyone 10 dollars an hour (I am evil)
     return worker.GetTotalHoursWorked () * 10;
   }
 }
</pre><br>  We have a class Worker (worker), which produces a certain amount of work, and this clock is added to an array.  The payment system - Payroll - receives the amount of these hours, multiplies them by the hourly rate, and makes payments.  Now imagine that we want to test the <code>Payroll</code> class, but in order for it to be a real unit test, we need to isolate the dependent <code>Person</code> class so that, for example, the <code>GetTotalHoursWorked()</code> function is <em>not called at all</em> .  How to do it?  Very simple: First, we create a <code>Payroll</code> as usual, but instead of <code>Person</code> we create a mock object: <br><br><pre> Worker w = Isolate.Fake.Instance &lt;Worker&gt; ();
 Payroll p = new Payroll ();
</pre><br>  Now our employee is like an employee, but with some configurable filling [ <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/56917/" title="In order for all this to work, you need to add links to two other assemblies from GAC to our assembly &amp; ndash; &quot;TypeMock Isolator&quot; and &quot;TypeMock Isolator &amp; ndash; Arrange-Act-Assert.">1</a> ].  Now we want the count to pass, but the <em>real</em> <code>Worker</code> will not be affected.  To do this, you need to change the <code>GetTotalHoursWorked()</code> call.  Here is how it is done: <br><br><pre> Isolate.WhenCalled (() =&gt; w.GetTotalHoursWorked ()). WillReturn (40);
</pre><br>  Everything is simple - instead of subsequent calls to <code>Person.GetTotalHoursWorked()</code> number 40 will be <code>Person.GetTotalHoursWorked()</code> returned. If you do not believe it, set a breakpoint on the function and you will see that no one is included in the testing. <br><br>  What we have just done is the preparation (Arrange phase) - the first of the three phases of the Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA) methodology that TypeMock supports [ <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/56917/" title="Two other approaches &amp; ndash; Reflective Mocks and Natural Mocks &amp; ndash; This essay is not considered.">2</a> ].  Now we will deal with the second phase - Act.  Here we will actually call our method, that is, we will perform an action on the system under test: <br><br><pre> int result = p. CalculatePay (w);
</pre><br>  Now try to guess the result!  After all, we even <code>workHours</code> not initialize <code>workHours</code> ‚Äî the value is <code>null</code> .  However, we have a very realistic result - 400. Moreover, we can even check that the <code>GetTotalHoursWorked()</code> method was actually called (the fact that the changed method was called does not matter).  This is the last phase of AAA, namely Assert.  We look: <br><br><pre> Assert.AreEqual (400, result);
 Isolate.Verify.WasCalledWithAnyArguments (() =&gt; w.GetTotalHoursWorked ());
</pre><br>  Finally, take a look at the whole test [ <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/56917/" title="It should also be noted that in addition to the Test attribute, you need to use the Isolated attribute either at the method level or at the class level &amp; ndash; This attribute allows you to clear the context of the used mock objects.">3</a> ] <br><br><pre> [Test]
 public void TestPayroll ()
 {
   // Arrange
   Payroll p = new Payroll ();
   Worker w = Isolate.Fake.Instance &lt;Worker&gt; ();
   Isolate.WhenCalled (() =&gt; w.GetTotalHoursWorked ()). WillReturn (40);
   // Act
   int result = p. CalculatePay (w);
   // Assert
   Assert.AreEqual (400, result);
   Isolate.Verify.WasCalledWithAnyArguments (() =&gt; w.GetTotalHoursWorked ());
 }
</pre><br>  So what did we do?  We tested the <code>Payroll.CalculatePay()</code> method, replacing the <code>Person</code> parameter with a certain similarity that behaved predictably and did not affect the actual properties and methods of the class. <br><br><h4>  Nonpublic </h4><br>  In our first example, everything was very simple - all our elements were public and therefore there were no access problems.  Now let's imagine that the <code>Worker.GetTotalHoursWorked()</code> method is in a different assembly, and is marked as <code>internal</code> : <br><br><pre> public class Worker
 {
   private List &lt;int&gt; workHours {get;  set;  }
   internal int GetTotalHoursWorked () {return workHours.Sum ();  }
 }
</pre><br>  Houston, we have a problem!  Our test will no longer compile, because  two lines of code using <code>GetTotalHoursWorked()</code> no longer have access to it: <br><br><pre> // will not work
 Isolate.WhenCalled (() =&gt; w.GetTotalHoursWorked ()). WillReturn (40);
 // this too
 Isolate.Verify.WasCalledWithAnyArguments (() =&gt; w.GetTotalHoursWorked ());
</pre><br>  How to replace the non-public method?  Elementary Watson!  Using <code>Isolator.NonPublic</code> we can set the method by name: <br><br><pre> Isolate.NonPublic.WhenCalled (w, "GetTotalHoursWorked"). WillReturn (40);
 ...
 Isolate.Verify.NonPublic.WasCalled (w, "GetTotalHoursWorked");
</pre><br>  That's all!  In the same way as methods, it is possible to intercept references, for example, to a property or an indexer ( <code>operator this[]</code> ).  Well, checks for calls can be done accordingly. <br><br><h4>  Statics, utilization, and other </h4><br>  In addition to working with objects that can be created with the <code>new</code> operator, TypeMock can also work with static objects.  For example, to fake a static constructor, we simply call <code>Isolate.Fake.StaticConstructor(typeof (T));</code>  , and then use TypeMock as before.  The same is done with static methods. <br><br>  In addition to replacing objects with moks, TypeMock supports duck typing, that is, the ability to replace one object with another, even when their interfaces are not exactly the same.  Here is a small example: <br><br><pre> public class Dog
 {
   public Dog () {}
   public string MakeSound ()
   {
     return "Woof";
   }
 }
 public class Duck
 {
   public string MakeSound ()
   {
     return "Quack";
   }
 }
</pre><br>  Here we have a duck and a dog, and we naturally want the dog to grunt.  In TypeMock, this is done like this: <br><br><pre> [TestFixture, Isolated]
 public class Tests
 {
   [Test]
   public void Test ()
   {
     // fake a dog
     Dog dog = Isolate.Fake.Instance &lt;Dog&gt; ();
     Duck duck = new Duck ();
     // replace calls on dog with calls on duck
     Isolate.Swap.CallsOn (dog) .WithCallsTo (duck);
     // get a dog to quack
     string sound = dog.MakeSound ();
     // did it?
     Assert.AreEqual ("Quack", sound);
     Isolate.Verify.WasCalledWithAnyArguments (() =&gt; dog.MakeSound ());
   }
 }
</pre><br><h4>  That's all! </h4><br>  I hope in this short post I showed that moki is not at all scary, and using them is easy!
