  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Charity Cayenne or Chichvarkin really burns!</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The owner of EUROSETI arranges a Christmas tree for the kids and sells his orphan car for this. <br><br>  Literally interesting article in his new <a href="http://chich8.livejournal.com/">LJ</a> . <br><br>  On January 11, the Euroset Charitable Foundation organizes a large Christmas tree for 5,700 children from large families from all over Russia in Luzhniki.  But they took up this business so late and we are doing such a holiday for the first time, which significantly exceeded the budget.  Therefore, I decided to sell what I do not feel an urgent need for.  For example, your Porsche Cayenne Turbo.  I exhibit it at a charity auction in which everyone can take part.  As soon as you transfer money to the Euroset charity foundation, you can immediately pick up the car.

I traveled fast and broke a lot of rules.  When the mileage was 130 thousand, the engine broke down.  A specialist from the tuning company 9FF, looking at the car, said literally the following: "Your car is close to death."  I still insisted that he fix it.  After tuning, replacing the engine and speeding up to 650 hp, he gave a guarantee that it would not travel more than 30-50 thousand kilometers.  Since then I have driven another 70 thousand. <br><br>  From what he repaired there, half is no longer working.  Although the windshield was changed twice, now I have a big crack on it again.  Airbrushing with the image of two witches partially peeled off, as someone hurt her with their doors.  The car drives really fast, but it eats oil terribly because something inside is broken.  Now she is probably the 150th time in the service.  I decided to sell it at least somehow put it in order.  And then there is something baking.  But I recently changed the headlights and driver's seat.  And, by the way, I never got into it in an accident, not counting the case when I drove into my ass. <br><br>  She never went on a German grandfather on German roads to pickaxes and back on Saturdays, who did not squeeze more than 40 km and did not press the pedal to the floor. <br><br>  The auction starts on Monday.  On the same day, as a last resort on Tuesday, the car will be parked at Euroset on Tverskaya, 4. You can see the lot with your own eyes.  The starting price is 50 thousand euros.  The price is too high, since it includes not only the cost of the car, but also the spirit that hovers in it.  If you open the sunroof, at the same time opens the gateway to space.  And then good thoughts come to mind (checked).  If you tune in to the right wave, good thoughts will come to you too.  In addition, when visiting Euroset stores, sellers will indulge in divine awe and the owner of such a car will become better served, even when everyone already knows that I sold the car.  For half a year, an additional Euroset salesperson‚Äôs smile and a glance with value are guaranteed. <br><br>  From the good: only 98 Ultimate was poured, airbrushing was done by a very good master Yura (he forgot his last name), it was served exclusively in the official service center and the music played loudly. <br><br>  Starting from Tuesday, every day the price will fall by 500 euros.  If there is not a single buyer, I will leave this Porsche on the street with the keys inside.  While someone does not contend with him.  Honestly, the one who drives these cars is just that.  Because it does not get out of the service. <br><br>  Payment for the car - a charitable contribution that will go to the construction of a children's town in a village near Moscow.  If the buyer wishes, on the website of the Euroset Charitable Foundation he will be respected and thanked, and a certificate will be issued with gratitude! <br><br>  Go!" </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/18592/">https://habr.com/ru/post/18592/</a></p>
