You can do it by your own company, without resorting to external service providers.  You can combine it with research of your client sector.  As a result, you can dramatically increase the level of sales and the number of loyal customers.  It is very simple, if only to follow the already established correct practice of mailings.  Unfortunately, as a rule, little is thought about this practice; as a result, mailings literally kill the business, scaring customers away.  How not to kill your business using mailings?  What should I do to avoid using a useful marketing tool to my own detriment? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The sales segment on the Internet, or e-commerce, is now developing very quickly.  If only because almost everyone can create their own store.  Making a newsletter, especially if you use the <a href="http://www.unisender.com/ru/">Unisender service is</a> also easy.  But more often, spam mailings or simple mass mailings, besides poorly thought out and organized, are not the case.  As a result - dissatisfied and lost customers.  But each of your newsletters is a point action, which, with the right approach, can significantly increase your ROI.  Let's see how to correctly approach your newsletters? <br><br><h4>  Base collection </h4><br>  The quality of your base is more important than its quantity.  Of course, there is a great temptation to buy someone's base and send a newsletter to it, but if you didn‚Äôt wait for your letters and didn‚Äôt subscribe to them, <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/107127/">this is spam</a> .  And spam in the first place causes rejection: it has become too much.  In addition, spam is actively fighting.

        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>

        </script>
      <br>
    <h4>  Internal base collection method </h4><br>  Spam is not our method.  Work on creating your own customer base, interested in you.  To do this, you need to adjust the process of collecting customer contact information (the process of collecting leads).  It is necessary to stimulate in any available way - offer to provide your data in exchange for a discount, bonuses, a discount coupon, participation in a lottery or a special promotion, offer a club card.  In addition, for the implementation of the purchase customers will have to register on the site, and thus get into your base.  And, finally, do not neglect those customers who began the process of buying and paying, but did not complete it - this is also a lead, which you can later remind that for some reason he did not make a purchase, but you are always willing to will help. <br><br><h4>  External base collection methods </h4><br>  You can use <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost_Per_Action">CPA</a> networks to recruit subscribers.  In this case, the cost of attracting a subscriber, as a rule, ranges from 20 to 50 rubles.  The quality of the subscriber needs to be negotiated in advance and specified in the contract. <br><br>  You can resort to <a href="http://www.unisender.com/ru/adv/">affiliate distribution systems</a> .  By doing affiliate mailing, you can also, theoretically, get to your potential customers.  As a rule, the quality of such subscribers is higher, but the cost of attracting such a lead is also higher - about 50 rubles. <br><br>  However, with this method of collecting leads, you need to remember that these are the ‚Äúcoolest‚Äù leads, that is, the least interested in you: you will need to do some work in order to ‚Äúburn‚Äù them and interest you.  Here you will be helped by competent chain of letters. <br><br><h4>  Base segmentation </h4><br>  Just mass mailing without <a href="http://www.unisender.com/ru/features/segments.html">base segmentation</a> is the basics.  However, if you want to significantly increase your ROI, you need to work more deeply with your base.  First of all, segment it according to where your lead came from.  Next, select segments by date of registration or lead collection.  Segment customers by conversion - made purchases, did not make a single purchase, did not open a single letter.  If you conduct focused work with each individual segment of the base, you are more likely to bring them to the stage of sale or re-purchase. <br><br><h4>  Letter chains </h4><br>  Chains of letters is the method of working with the contact you receive, which is most effective if you provide separate chains for each of the strategically important segments of your base.  For each segment, set up an automatic chain of trigger messages based on the level of interest and loyalty of the segment to you. <br><br><h4>  Purchase history </h4><br>  An extremely useful tool for the segmentation of your base can serve as a mechanism for tracking the history of purchases.  Having such information about your lead, you can offer him products from the same or adjacent category, offer to buy a new product from the new collection, offer security for the purchased product or ‚Äúexchange‚Äù the old model for a new one.  In addition, based on records in the history of purchases, you can segment leads as having made only one purchase, two, or more - thus highlighting the base segments by the degree of their loyalty. <br><br><h4>  Letter frequency </h4><br>  It often happens that a customer has made one purchase in an online store, and a caring mailing manager sets up a completely ‚Äúirresponsible‚Äù newsletter for him with the number of letters 3 per day, where every time you are asked to buy something else.  And what if I bought a thermometer in an online pharmacy, for example, when I was sick, and now I have been offered everything for almost a week - from diapers to a respirator?  That's right, the question is in a bad base segmentation and in the wrongly configured chains.  In addition, the main rule - the frequency of letters should not exceed once a week.  And it is good to remember that each of your letters may be the last - if you do not please the client, he can simply unsubscribe.  Therefore, make every letter of your thoughtful and at least hypothetically necessary for your client. <br><br><h4>  Letter template </h4><br>  It‚Äôs good if you don‚Äôt create every single letter from scratch.  Receiving letters in the standard of a single branded template, the client gets used exactly to your colors and the system of presenting information, which should also contribute to loyalty.  Do not forget to include in the template the obligatory lines indicating where the client appeared in your mailing list and how it can be unsubscribed.  Think over html and the text version of the letter.  Make your letters easy, pay attention to the simplicity of the layout and make sure that the letters are displayed on mobile devices without any problems. <br><br><h4>  Test </h4><br>  Test everything: every letter before sending, every link in the letter.  Go through the registration process on your site and go through it every time after making changes to it.  Put yourself in the shoes of your client: how comfortable is everything?  Do not get error pages?  Do not links lead there?  How fast can I register and will I lose any interest in the purchase due to the complexity of registration? <br><br>  Test not only letters, but also variants of letters.  For this you can use <a href="http://www.unisender.com/ru/features/split.html">split testing</a> .  Test each segment: what does it respond better to?  What language of the presentation of material is more like a particular segment?  What more interests from your range?  What letter headers, links, content, location of buttons and pictures make each segment liven up individually? <br><br>  This is the only way you can be sure both in the quality of your letters and in the qualities of your base.  So test everything and always. <br><br><h4>  Key indicators </h4><br>  What KPIs do you rate in the mailing process?  Every business defines them for itself.  However, sales will be the key indicator for an online store.  You can also analyze the number of open letters, the number of formal replies, the number of links to the site.  But they all do not give you anything if there are no sales.  Use the sales funnel, optimize for its algorithm, not only your newsletter, but also the usability of the store.  Your goal is to attract and monetize your traffic. <br><br>  To summarize, let's highlight a small list of requirements that each of your newsletters must meet.  Once again, conceiving the newsletter, remember each of your newsletters should be: <br><ol><li>  potential customer </li><li>  easily displayed by mail services and mobile devices </li><li>  easy to read call to action </li><li>  containing only valid links and data about your products and services </li><li>  selling </li></ol><br>  The purpose of your mailing is sales.  However, you need to achieve this goal without losing customers, so follow the dispatch schedule, use testing, conversation and database segmentation. <br><br><h5>  PS </h5>  More interesting posts on our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/UniSenderRussia">facebook page</a> .  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/UniSenderRussia"><b>Like?</b></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/147415/">https://habr.com/ru/post/147415/</a></p>
