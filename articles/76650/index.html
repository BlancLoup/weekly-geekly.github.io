  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What to do with negative reviews?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  When various trading companies and marketers talk about social networks, they often get worried: what about negative reviews?  I saw this question in the comments to my previous posts, and now I would like to discuss it. <br><br>  According to a survey by Shop.org and MarketingSherpa, less than 26% of retailers have ratings and consumer reviews;  at the same time, 96% of companies with reviews consider them effective or highly efficient.  So what prevents other companies from using this feature? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  In addition to the complexities of technology and computing, the fear of negative feedback is one of the greatest barriers that retailers ‚Äî especially sales managers ‚Äî must overcome in order to take advantage of reviews and ratings.  At the same time, among many clients and according to many data, negative reviews are considered not only necessary, but also very useful.

      In a recent product review, Patti Freeman Evans, an analyst at Jupiter, suggests: ‚ÄúIn terms of user-generated content, companies must extract good from bad.  But since consumers are more inclined to talk about positive experiences, retailers should not fear the old aphorism: ‚ÄúFear your desires.‚Äù  Consumers expect to see both good and bad reviews.  Good reviews confirm product information coming from the supplier;  the bad ones warn against such things that the retailer cannot say about himself. <br><br>  <b>1. Consumers are looking for negative feedback.</b> <br><br>  According to eVoc Insights, 48 ‚Äã‚Äãpercent of consumers need to review reviews before online purchase.  What are they looking for? <br><br>  I often ask friends and just people I meet, how they use testimonials.  Almost everyone mentions that they are looking for negative comments to make sure that they can put up with any shortcomings of the purchased products.  We all know that we do not live in the world of luxury products, and consumers have a great desire to know about the imperfections of a product before purchasing it. <br><br>  If 48% of consumers have a need to read reviews before purchasing, it means that they are looking for information about possible product flaws.  If they do not find it on your site, they will find it elsewhere. <br><br>  ‚ÄúRegarding the product (s) that are negatively reviewed,‚Äù my experience shows that if a product has positive reviews, then negative ones will not harm it, ‚Äùsaid Don Zeydler, director of direct marketing at W. Atlee Burpee Co . ‚ÄúI would suggest that when consumers see a mix of different ratings, they are more likely to trust the feedback process.  In addition, we all, as marketers, know (or should know) that consumers interested in a particular product are looking only for evidence in favor or not in favor of the fact that this product is exactly what they need.  Negative reviews help consumers make sure that they have studied all the information about the product before purchasing it.  If the reviews are not completely and completely negative, but only indicate individual product flaws, about which people decide that they can easily be reconciled (and usually they are), these negative reviews help consumers to overcome indecision before buying. ‚Äù <br><br>  <b>2. Negative reviews establish authenticity</b> <br><br>  Do you yourself believe that all your products belong to the class "luxury"?  You, like all consumers, know that we do not live in the world of goods of this class.  Consumers know that if there are no conflicting opinions about the product, then the existing opinions are not real.  If they see only enthusiastic reviews, they will not read recommendations coming from the manufacturer, but reliable consumer reviews for making purchasing decisions. <br><br>  For example, which product remains one of the best-selling in this decade?  That's right, Apple's iPod.  He has a lot of positive reviews, but among them you meet again and again one negative comment - that the surface of the iPod is easily scratched.  Consumers say things that retailers and Apple itself cannot say: ‚ÄúWhen buying an iPod, buy a case for it.‚Äù  Obviously, this does not prevent consumers from buying iPods, but this constructive advice pushes them to purchase a case (selling accessories for iPods - a business worth a billion!). <br><br>  <b>3. Negative reviews help build a business.</b> <br><br>  Negative reviews not only help consumers make purchasing decisions, they also bring other benefits: <br><br>  For example, negative feedback increases customer satisfaction and reduces returns in cases where your product is far from perfect. <br><br>  If you sell a poor quality product, you have three options: <br><ul><li>  Without feedback, you continue to sell it and run the risk of incurring losses on returns and leaving customers unsatisfied. </li><li>  With feedback, you can use a leading indicator of negative feedback and quickly remove this product from sale, thus reducing the number of returns and increasing customer satisfaction. </li><li>  Or simply letting negative reviews direct consumers to more satisfactory purchases within the relevant categories.  Let the best products win, and you will win with them. </li></ul><br>  In cases 2 and 3, you remain a trustworthy ‚Äúeditor‚Äù of the best products;  consumers are satisfied;  you keep their loyalty and avoid returns. <br><br>  <b>4. Negative reviews are not so many</b> <br><br>  After the above three options, you may agree that negative feedback is not a bad thing.  But, if the management is still in doubt, here is a decisive argument: positive feedback comes on average seven times more than negative. <br><br>  A recent study by the KellerFay group showed that about two-thirds (62%) of discussions related to brands present them in a positive light, and only less than one out of ten conversations - in a negative one. <br><br>  And, according to a recent survey by Jupiter about ratings and reviews, 60% of online shoppers share their experience about buying a product, and they are more likely to leave positive rather than negative feedback. <br><br>  That's all.  You might expect a lot more negative reviews than you actually get.  For those who receive, treat them as gifts of the Gods of authenticity and trust, which can help your business rather than harm it. <br><br>  ps Please do not be angry with me for the fact that maybe I published my article in the wrong blog.  I believe that it is the start-ups that are needed and this information will be most useful. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/76650/">https://habr.com/ru/post/76650/</a></p>
