      In the Celts, Samhain was strongly associated with death and the supernatural.  Despite the efforts of Christians, the pagan roots of Samhain still made their way out - and manifested themselves in the form of Halloween.  Obviously, the belief of people in the paranormal and the fear hidden inside cannot be destroyed.  On the night of October 31 to November 1, rituals are conducted to calm the dead, tell scary stories, summon spirits, and in every possible way turn to the "wrong side of reality."  At a primitive level, the holiday turns into a competition, who more creatively frightens those around them.  Technological gadgets are great for achieving the goal.  They are scary in and of themselves, and if you try again ... Meet Digital Halloween 2016. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <font color="#660000"><i>For death enters our windows, invades our halls, to destroy the children from the street, young men from the squares.</i></font> <font color="#660000"><i><br></i></font>  <font color="#660000"><i>(Jeremiah 9:22)</i></font> <br><br>  Sooner or later, death will come for each of us.  It‚Äôs only a matter of time before we face her face before we let out the last breath ... One Wisconsin resident decided that his neighbors shouldn‚Äôt wait that long.  They should certainly meet with death earlier - and he <a href="https://twitter.com/ZacCrueger/status/787810477799772160">launched the Black widow in the sky</a> , suspended on a quadcopter. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e9a/a8d/9ca/e9aa8d9caf1b4b04ac8e13de9629920a.jpg"><br>  <font color="gray">Photos: Twitter / <a href="https://twitter.com/ZacCrueger/status/787810477799772160">Zac Crueger</a></font> <br><br>  Residents of the surrounding houses are now scared to look up. <br><br>  <font color="#660000"><i>And they poured there.</i></font>  <font color="#660000"><i>But as soon as they began to eat the stew, they shouted and said: death in the cauldron, man of God!</i></font>  <font color="#660000"><i>And they could not eat.</i></font> <font color="#660000"><i><br></i></font>  <font color="#660000"><i>(4 Kings 4:40)</i></font> <br><br>  In space, it is convenient to scare people to death.  Because here no one hears you screaming.  NASA engineers staged a <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NASAPumpkin%3Fsrc%3Dhash">corporate pumpkin horror contest</a> in which they used various technical devices.  At NASA, such a competition is held every year. <br><br>  For example, the device <a href="https://twitter.com/YazzieSays/status/791726802037125120">Martian Sample Return Mission</a> is a model of the returned apparatus, which returned from the surface of Mars and brought ... a living creature!  Indeed, we were confident that there is life on Mars. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/13d/10f/ad0/13d10fad05be439a8ef1d554630be741.jpg"><br><br>  The subject of the returned apparatus with the samples turned out to be rich for creativity.  ‚ÄúLife is like a box of chocolates.  You never know which one you want. ‚Äù  The same with samples from Mars.  Who knows <a href="https://twitter.com/YazzieSays/status/791725970612813829">what awaits us there</a> ? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f85/c88/2f3/f85c882f3d9348ff975ef8a996c86ec6.jpg"><br><br>  The staff of <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259E%25D0%25B1%25D1%2581%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F_%25D1%2581%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D1%2587%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B9_%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8">the Solar Dynamics Observatory</a> (SDO) made a <a href="https://twitter.com/JayIsPainting/status/791353540698640384">pumpkin resembling flares on the sun</a> .  Indeed, if you look closely, then our star has a very frightening look.  No one knows what is worse - the pumpkin or the real Sun. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fa4/b29/b9f/fa4b29b9f95a487f9c703829d069caef.jpg"><br>  <i>Sun (left) and pumpkin (right) from NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory staff</i> <br><br>  Some NASA employees approached the competition even more creatively.  For example, astronomers from the Ames Research Center at Moffett Field have prepared a real <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2016/nasa-missions-harvest-a-passel-of-pumpkin-stars/">scientific paper</a> on pumpkin stars.  So called a special type of rapidly rotating stars, which emit x-rays 100 times higher than the peak levels of the sun.  The oblate shape of such stars is explained by their ultra-fast rotation around its axis.  It is assumed that these stars were formed as a result of the fusion of binary systems. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kimszroryKs" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  The scientific article is accompanied by the characteristics of 18 rare stars of this type, collected as a result of observation with the help of the Kepler and Swift telescopes.  A scientific article about pumpkin stars was <a href="http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/0004-637X/831/1/27">published</a> in the <i>Astrophysical Journal</i> .  Scientists have tried to guess for Halloween.  The article was published online on October 25, 2016, and in a paper issue of the magazine will be released as it should be - on November 1.  The most extreme of the described stars is the orange giant of class K KSw 71, which is 10 times larger than the Sun, makes a full revolution in 5.5 days and generates X-rays 4,000 times more powerful than the Sun. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ce8/d0a/9dd/ce8d0a9dd0bd4883b7eb04a56c5167ca.jpg"><br>  <i>Orange giant class K KSw 71 compared to the Sun</i> <br><br>  Other exhibits at the NASA competition include a pumpkin robot in the form of a voracious pakman and a pumpkin with a mechanical arm. <br><br>  Engineers did not ignore the political theme.  At the moment, the most retweets at NASA (about 2000 retweets) were collected by the <a href="https://twitter.com/YazzieSays/status/791730478524997632">installation</a> in the form of presidential candidates Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton.  This is really a ritual of appeasing the dead. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e89/b26/ac7/e89b26ac7d0a4da7862e42b84e1dc6d6.jpg"><br><br>  The enterprising Chinese have <a href="http://learningenglish.voanews.com/a/americans-wearing-trump-clinton-masks-halloween-election-candy/3570010.html">prepared</a> in <a href="http://learningenglish.voanews.com/a/americans-wearing-trump-clinton-masks-halloween-election-candy/3570010.html">advance for</a> the fact that this year Halloween almost coincides with the US election.  Given the mental closeness of these events, it was quite logical to assume that many Americans will want to wear a Trump or Clinton mask on the night of death and the other world.  Sociological polls have shown that 55% will want to wear a mask of Donald, and 45% - the mask of Hillary. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2c3/fd7/24d/2c3fd724d5367f23d9cb711d2b1ffee0.jpg"><br>  <i>A worker in a Chinese factory checks the presentation of the Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton Halloween masks.</i>  <i>Jinhua Partytime Latex Art and Crafts Factory in Jinhua, Zhejiang Province.</i>  <i>May 25, 2016.</i>  <i><font color="gray">Photo: Reuters / Aly Song</font></i> <br><br>  By the way, the political theme is popular in RuNet.  True, there is only <a href="https://fotostrana.ru/public/post/231949/1207685464/">one candidate for intimidation</a> .  But he is worse than both American combined. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2e1/fea/a21/2e1feaa21bb60037bf79b78cd6c60bf7.jpg"><br><br>  <font color="#660000"><i>And when He removed the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth animal, saying: Go and see.</i></font> <font color="#660000"><i><br></i></font>  <font color="#660000"><i>And I looked, and, behold, a pale horse, and on him a horseman, by whom the name "death";</i></font>  <font color="#660000"><i>and hell followed him;</i></font>  <font color="#660000"><i>and power over the fourth part of the earth is given to him ‚Äî to kill with the sword and with hunger, with the pestilence and the beasts of the earth.</i></font> <font color="#660000"><i><br></i></font>  <font color="#660000"><i>(Revelation of John the Divine 6: 7)</i></font> <br><br>  Fear among mortals sow and employees of Facebook.  For this Halloween, they have released <a href="http://newsroom.fb.com/news/2016/10/no-tricks-just-treats-from-facebook-this-halloween/">new masks on Facebook Live</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d59/ded/5dd/d59ded5dd77f4cc4885922baec3af821.jpg"><br>  <i><font color="gray">Photo: Facebook</font></i> <br><br>  As it is easy to guess, the masks are made on the basis of the Belarusian technology MSQRD, which the corporation Facebook acquired in March of this year.  This is the first time that Facebook has implemented the imposition of masks on a live video stream directly in the Facebook Live application (previously it was only possible to broadcast video from MSQRD to Facebook). <br><br>  In addition, the company has updated the Halloween Reactions Emoji set specifically for Halloween.  Laughter, surprise, sadness and anger have never been so ugly. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/036/172/8b6/0361728b6796348e0fb425b88b4340fc.png"><br>  <i><font color="gray">Image: Facebook</font></i> <br><br>  <font color="#660000"><i>Say: Thus saith the Lord: And the dead bodies of the people shall be cast aside as dung on the field and as sheaves behind the reaper, and there will be no one to gather them.</i></font> <font color="#660000"><i><br></i></font>  <font color="#660000"><i>(Jeremiah 9:22)</i></font> <br><br>  Halloween has Celtic roots and is traditionally celebrated in English-speaking countries, as well as in countries that are friendly to American and British culture.  For example, this holiday is very loved in Japan. <br><br>  Recently, many Russians began to celebrate Halloween, which also speaks of Russia's proximity to Western civilization.  In some schools on this day <a href="https://versia.ru/v-rossii-prazdnuyut-zapadnyj-prazdnik-xyellouin-nesmotrya-na-protesty-ego-protivnikov">they arrange</a> festive evenings, competitions for the best costumes and thematic lessons of the English language. <br><br>  For the same reason, the ‚Äúsatanic feast‚Äù causes an acute rejection among the Slavophiles.  ‚ÄúAccordingly, those who celebrate Halloween in Russia deduce themselves from the category of our compatriots.  The days of common joy, like the days of common grief, are in fact one of the main reasons that shape the people and unite the nation.  In the case of ‚ÄúHalloween‚Äù, people deliberately leave the national tradition to a foreign, Irish-American ... They want to destroy us - we must focus on what unites us and free ourselves from others, destructive, ‚Äùthe author <a href="https://regnum.ru/news/society/2199102.html">warns</a> in one of the nationalistic sites. <br><br>  One can imagine how the fighters for the purity of the Russian culture organize patrols, which, like locusts, scurry through the streets, clearing them from "nasty", that is, from the "destructive" alien tradition. <br><br>  So be careful - while celebrating Halloween, you can really face the forces of evil. <br><br>  <font color="#660000"><i>And out of the smoke came locusts on the earth, and power was given to it, which earth scorpions have.</i></font> <font color="#660000"><i><br></i></font>  <font color="#660000"><i>And it was said to her that she would not harm the grass of the earth, and no greenery, and no tree, but only one people who do not have the seal of God on their foreheads.</i></font> <font color="#660000"><i><br></i></font>  <font color="#660000"><i>And it was not given to her to kill them, but only to torment them for five months;</i></font>  <font color="#660000"><i>and the torment of it is like the torment of a scorpion when it stings a man.</i></font> <font color="#660000"><i><br></i></font>  <font color="#660000"><i>In those days people will seek death, but they will not find it;</i></font>  <font color="#660000"><i>wish to die, but death will escape from them.</i></font> <font color="#660000"><i><br></i></font>  <font color="#660000"><i>(Revelation of John the Divine 9: 3-6)</i></font> <br><br>  According <a href="http://wlfi.com/2016/10/30/purdue-professor-halloween-offers-safe-dose-of-fear-and-fun/">to</a> philosophy professor Daniel Kelly (Daniel Kelly) from Purdue University (USA), people like Halloween so much because of the specific features of the human psyche.  So, people feel a special pleasure when they feel a sense of fear, but at the same time they are safe.  According to the expert, people enjoy this state, as if "playing with fire."  Similarly, horror movies. <br><br>  If you are not at all afraid of the appearance of devilishly painted faces, then you will not get any pleasure. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/684/82b/81b/68482b81be8c470f9fd1fe4c045b4ec4.jpg"><br>  <i>Jack's lamp carved from turnips, early 20th century.</i>  <i><font color="gray">Photo: Traditional Life Museum, Ireland</font></i> <br><br>  <b>See also: <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/mailru/blog/282070/">Geek Halloween: Unusual DIY Halloween Costumes</a></b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/398845/">https://habr.com/ru/post/398845/</a></p>
