    <h4>  Myth # 1 - 100% Uptime guarantee: </h4><br><br>  <i>A man in his life cannot be sure of anything, except that he will have to part with it.</i> <br>  George Meredith <br><br>  In our time, I would have rephrased the phrase a little: 100% guarantee in our life only one thing - death. <br>  I will tell you a secret, data centers are also not immortal. <br><br>  <b>Let's start with common sense:</b> do you know the column in contracts and public offers about force majeure?  Well, who does not happen, the truth is true.  Oh yeah, the "one hundred percent centrers" usually have none, well, apart from the rules of use and obligations in relation to your webmoney and return them through blood and tears, and if there is, then not a word about 100% uptime - otherwise the court ... <br><br>  Although wait, somehow in search of a data center already in Europe, I discovered the website of a colocate with such a guarantee (a rather large local Internet provider, by the way).  Agreed with the sales-manager to inspect the miracle data center.  He arrived at a protected building, went up to the third floor where, in fact, he was located.  After some time, the seller met me (let's call them that because their methods are not much better than Ap from ‚Äúour‚Äù markets).  A quick inspection of the data center showed that it had two rooms to accommodate the equipment: one to place the servers in the tower housing (hetzner ay!), The other to accommodate racks and rack units (this was closer to my soul), - one room for the maintenance of equipment and another in which were technical support staff and administrators. <br>  All this was spectacularly highlighted by neon and was behind the darkened different colors of glass, but they did not let in to have a look inside even under supervision.  In general, it would have made an effect on an unknowing person: security, blackout, a ban on entry, neon (somewhere without him), a bunch of employees and a giant screen on the wall with the arrangement of units.  Beautiful, but I'm a pragmatist. <br>  At that time, I was primarily interested in the very 30 percent of the budget of any data center - the channel-access to the network. <br><br>  We decided to check the channel from several points: Russia, Moscow, Stack;  Germany, Frankfurt, NetDirekt;  Netherlands, Amsterdam, Leaseweb;  and a couple of links from webhostingtalk.com to servers in the US and all Indi, Chinah. <br><br>  Bottom line: ping was no different from the same from ds, in which I already lived, but checking for megabits (speed, real width of the channel) showed an absolute impossibility of working with this DC.  A speed of 15 megabits was given to Germany (although they give everything they can give to the test, believe me), 7-5 megabits to the Netherlands ‚Äî they danced, Russia had 3 megabits and lower, US megabits and others in the amount (!!!) megabit <br><br>  Here is such an arithmetic, to a reasonable question, ‚ÄúWhat kind of bullshit are you trying to drive me for the same price?‚Äù Answered, ‚ÄúNow we‚Äôll fix everything, try to mow traffic‚Äù and with quite simple manipulations tried all the traffic of your DC in real time (it was by the way before refusing :)) redirecting via Teliu ... As a result, little has changed, except for the expression on my face (by surprise, what are they doing?), to which the seller said, "Do you understand this new data center, we have only one uplink here so far to the local exchanger at 10 gigabits. "  As you already understood the question was removed. <br><br>  This is how gentlemen, <i>even in Europe, sometimes 1x10 Gbit to IX = 100% Uptime Guarantee!</i>  And believe it not only in the Eastern part (hello to the French!).  By the way, they have the only English site in this country :). <br>  <i>At the moment, after 3 years, 100% uptime has been removed from the site.</i>  <i>Now they write that they have a platform under the protection of NATO :), although in fact an ordinary business center with a large hyper-market is nearby.</i> <br><br>  <b>Tip:</b> ask for a link to the file in HTTP to check the channel from different points, it is advisable to check with a 10 megabyte file host host (tracktracker.com) or a similar service, or open a topic on webhostingtalk.com (only after 10 posts on the forum!) In the section other reviews, with a link and a request to evaluate the channel from all over the world.  Also do not forget the standard - traceroute, whois, asinfo, ping for 1 hour. <br><br><h4>  Myth # 2 - 24/7 Support: </h4><br><br>  <i>Work is not a wolf, will not run to the forest</i> <br>  Operation Y (thanks to FloppyFormator) <br><br>  <b>A bit of common sense:</b> on the evening shift workers spend on average one and a half times more money than on day shift workers, the salary can not be less than the minimum + 100-200 euros for the "night", work every other day and usually technical students;  about 6,000 euros a month at the data center goes to the salary of permanent employees in the DC, that is, protection and change of administrators;  at night they sleep in sleeping bags on the floor, even in the data center of the largest TelCo company in my small country. <br>  I told you only about tech support, at least they will be able to connect and execute the remote hands to you, but there is still an army of outsourced "boys" and "girls" from local Voronezh, who transmit messages, awaken the system at night.  admins in ds, and who also need to pay the minimum salary, and crap, and eat (meaning in the office, there it is required to provide). <br><br>  All this is in the data center where the largest banks, factories, ships and airlines of the country are located, <i>but you will not get there</i> , because their sites are all in the local language. <br><br>  What is going on in foreign-language cheap data centers?  Well <i>, it's usually either a stoned rastafaray in the Netherlands, or a humble worker who will sleep on Saturday and Sunday and has no idea how to install FreeBSD or Solaris</i> .  Although I don‚Äôt hide, there are other models in which the support is invested NOT LESS than cooling in data centers, but in the end they still save on the same cooling :( <u>fail</u> . <br>  Memo: A call in the afternoon to American small cheap data centers gives the answer ‚Äúplease wait‚Äù, and after a while ‚Äúall operators are busy, please leave your message after the signal‚Äù. <br><br>  <b>Tip:</b> pretty trite, but call the caliper at night or directly ask sales (grrr!) About specific support 24/7 every day (not only working days) from 00:00 to 24:00 (they are afraid of customers who know a lot ) and whether it will be stipulated in the official ‚Äúcontract for LLC‚Äù (they are afraid of ALL). <br><br><h4>  Myth number 3 - Un-un-un-unMetered Gigabit !: </h4><br>  <i>Must be made in the style of Monsterkill from Unreal Tournament</i> <br><br>  <i>HAPPINESS FOR EVERYONE, GIFT, AND LET NO ONE, WILL LEAVE BADLY!</i> <br>  Strugatsky <br><br>  This is the most painful (oops!) And dangerous myth, because such money is spinning on it. <br>  Well, imagine a greedy, greedy, fat 10LetHoster with experience offers a client on the Gigabit forum with a cost of 40,000 euros and here JATUTSuperHost "breaks the gigabit for 100 bucks in the perfect data center in Europe!", And recently it was "perfect data center in Moscow! ‚Äù(just burst, poor ...). <br><br>  <b>Well, in general, you understand, common sense (s):</b> 10 gigabits before the exchanger costs 5,000 euros per month + installation 3,000 euros, equipment for distribution costs 30-40 thousand euros, translated into current leasing or credit (2-3 years) 1000 euros per month, providing staff another 3000 euros per month, carrying cables from 500 euros per 100 meters and their further maintenance, "I have no idea how much, because the hotelke has strangled a toad."  And this, gentlemen, I repeat, the type IX exchanger! <br><br>  The cost of Tier 1 channels varies from 2-3 Euros per megabit of each provider. As a result, connecting to a private exchange point with all available external connections via Tier 1 country providers will cost 40000 Euros per 1 gigabit. <br><br>  What prices are real in Russia with its immense land, sudden excavators and scrap lovers, I am afraid to imagine. <br><br>  And in the end, "Hosting the name of September 1," this gigabit offers you for a penny ... <br>  ‚ÄúBut what about the wholesale?‚Äù You ask reasonably, you know, there‚Äôs such a thing, no ‚Äúcheap‚Äù data center can afford more channels than 40 gigabits, usually it is 10 gigabytes to the nearest exchanger, since  relying mainly on local customers and 100 megabits or gigabits of a few others, Tier 1/2 does not live directly with them. <br>  Memo: Disassemble at leisure Leaseweb into pieces, for example, they have an infrastructure map on the site (and this is the largest of the cheapest). <br><br>  The reason for this deception is simple: rarely when the project really knows what it needs. <br>  And indeed, you can ‚Äúpush‚Äù whatever you want by connecting the client to the gigabit port of the kitty (Cisco), colleagues forgive me, and in the event you can blame everything on the last mile operator, a la: ‚Äúyou know, you have a problem with channel at your Internet service provider, call him ";  or if the client is ‚Äústitched‚Äù, ‚Äúhere‚Äôs a channel at RTKomma‚Äù (sacred in general, although it‚Äôs true lately), ‚ÄúDo you still call the provider, can there be a peering war?‚Äù, ‚Äúwe are fine (c)‚Äù. <br><br>  <i>And YES 1 Gigabit you can‚Äôt ‚Äúpump‚Äù (fashionable nonce word) to your home, no matter how hard you try and so your Internet provider will not flood you, because it operates with exactly the same methods for the same amounts with the same "excuses".</i>  <i>Even if you buy a 1 gigabit channel from a Tier 1 provider, then you will have this ‚Äúgigabit‚Äù only to the access points of this provider, but not to the end client!</i> <br><br>  <b>Advice: a</b> project of 60-100 thousand visitors, with an abundance of pictures ‚Äúchews‚Äù only 50-70 megabits of traffic. <br>  If you do not place the file exchanger, do not "stream" the video and do not distribute pornography (which is the same thing that was listed nowadays), look within 100 Mb / s, preferably burstable, so that the "Habroeffect" does not kill. <br>  Usually the best channels in any country with large TelCo providers, because  they take in bulk, partially form their network (the local ones are all inside their network usually) and the output channel (what you need, because you give the content) is less busy (although it‚Äôs not known what‚Äôs happening with ‚Äúthese‚Äù torrents of yours), although if the traffic is considered (terabytes, gigabytes), it may not work, besides, the placement of them is not worth a penny. <br>  If you need guaranteed delivery, demand guaranteed channel width via Tier 1 networks - you will not find it better. <br><br>  On the one hand, clients ‚Äúdon‚Äôt know what they want‚Äù and hosters give them ‚Äúwhat they need,‚Äù on the other hand, clients often don‚Äôt try to change anything, because it seems to them that ‚Äúthere can‚Äôt be no better‚Äù and ‚Äúthere‚Äôs no horse change. " <br><br>  Although, as practice shows, whoever deceived him once, he deceives and twice and most often the proposed traffic is trash (pure exchanger, narrow band).  And they will show it to you, either by specifically cleaning it from other lemmings for a certain period, or ‚Äúin good time of day and absolutely non-flying weather‚Äù ... <br><br><h4>  Myth number 4 - Abroad will help us !: </h4><br><br>  ‚ÄúForeigners will help us!‚Äù <br>  Ilf and Petrov (although Ostap Bender is better suited) <br><br>  Actually, on this one can close the debunking of this myth, at least for those who know the original quotation. <br><br>  <b>Common sense:</b> ‚Äúwho are you here for ... surrendered with your polymers‚Äù?  :) They and their problems abound.  You are just ‚Äúmoney from the outside‚Äù for them and most often you don‚Äôt impose any liability on them, because if anything, they can refer to ‚Äúbears‚Äù who do not know how to sign ‚Äúwhere necessary‚Äù and the fact that you misunderstood the offer and stuck his nose at finely written text, or the Dutch language was incorrectly translated into ‚Äútheir site‚Äù ... <br><br>  You should not look for free cheese abroad, believe it here, too, in mousetraps and the ‚Äútrilateral‚Äù principle of marketing works the same everywhere, otherwise why are there ‚Äúexpensive‚Äù data centers where local, international banks and corporations are hosted? <br><br>  Do the following names say anything to you: 3fn, McColo (what a consonance ...), AlphaRed? <br>  The list is not complete, and there will be more, the Internet has just begun to pace the planet :).  Everyone needs to spin, everyone needs to spin, and everyone cannot hide from the actions and laws of the authorities.  Only if a bribe works in Russia or a letter to the president, in Europe or the United States, will you have to prove everything in court if you do not notice the warning (gentlemen, check the boxes of abuse @ and postmaster @! And don‚Äôt say you sent them to / dev / null) and will not promote the actions of the authorities.  <i>The police work here rarely, but quickly and accurately.</i> <br><br>  <b>Tip:</b> How do you know if your ds is involved in something unnatural?  Honestly, I gave this advice already, but try to be hosted by TelCo providers, however this is a rather expensive option anyway.  And so, just see if attacks from this ds are coming at you, whether your IPs are attacked by portans from their networks and especially the networks under their networks, etc.  primitive measures.  In a different way, you will find out about your clientele only on the spot or through dating. <br><br><h4>  Myth number 5 - European quality: </h4><br><br>  ‚ÄúQuadratisch.  Praktisch.  Gut <br>  Rittersport slogan <br><br>  Unfortunately, this quote is often a guide to action, and not a description of the work of Europeans and Americans (although of course this is not the horrors in the boxes of aggression, although the latest pictures from one American dz suggest that the cardboard is a quadratic package). <br>  That is, there is a square box of 1pc., Practical few penny iron, all this with the remark ‚ÄúGut‚Äù is popped by a hardworking euro on the shelf, from where it connects to a cheap switch (China) bought for a pittance on a sale from leasing companies and is given to you (khm , khm, kherr Khettsner) for 39 gold coins. <br>  I'm sorry, I made a habit of working with high-quality hardware from brands and after them it‚Äôs very hard without the ‚Äúmighty Russian‚Äù to describe the disgrace that ‚Äúthese‚Äù miracle data centers offer. <br><br>  <b>Common sense:</b> no magic European leasing / loan will allow selling good hardware with super-support and security and good channels with good payback for 39 or even 89 euros per month.  Either it smells illegal, or they cheat you into arrogant. <br><br>  <b>Advice:</b> ‚ÄúO Allah!‚Äù Do you need advice here?  I will act in a ‚Äúquestion to question‚Äù way: <i>if you are not concerned about the quality of your hardware, then why do you need RAID, Uptime, and all these other incomprehensible terms of ours?</i>  Take Asus eeeBox, put in any data center (and you can even at home on ADSL) and forget about all the greedy reptiles-hosts. <br>  In general, if you don‚Äôt care about the difference between ‚ÄúZhiguli‚Äù and ‚ÄúAudi‚Äù, then you don‚Äôt care about the difference between cheap home-made hardware and Oracle Sun servers. <br><br><h4>  Myth number 6 - All hosters / dts greedy freaks: </h4><br><br>  <i>Iron logic</i> <br>  The twist of fate (thanks to FloppyFormator) <br><br>  Honestly, I don‚Äôt know what to say, especially to people who, at Celerone, for 35 euros want to serve 100k people "in the database in 3 gebe and the web site under the apache in pahepe." <br><br>  <b>Common sense:</b> hidden and buried in business plans for data centers.  In hosting it is noticed hiding in the price of servers, a license (if required), some kind of support, administrators, bookkeeping, jur.  documents, as well as taxes, percentage of processing centers, the price of registering a company and placing in a data center - difficult to calculate? <br>  <i>Oh yes, BlueHost, Dreamhost - this is magic, although wait!</i>  <i>See myth number 1, number 3 and number 5, and sometimes there are number 2.</i> <br><br>  <b>Advice:</b> read the contracts, especially what is written in small print, the number of files allowed on the server, or a very interesting feature for not knowing clients - the number of simultaneously open file descriptors (you can‚Äôt count them for hosting phpBB sites for 1000 visitors a day :)) and the like. <br><br>  That's all for today.  I hope you - the habrovans will like the article and that the colleagues have not yet ordered the killer for the fact that I ‚Äúpassed all‚Äù. <br><br>  But in fact, he had long been going to write an article of this kind. <br><br>  Hosting.ua burned out ds (by the way ‚Äúwas there a boy?‚Äù In the sense of whether the alarm system was really there?) Pushed to hurry with a description of all the subtleties, and the banal ‚Äúenvy‚Äù of McHost.ru and in particular that many customers still looking for excuses for what happened (‚Äúbecause they can't forgive themselves?‚Äù) made it urgent to post it on Habr, especially here you were the first to know about what is happening. <br><br>  PS: It is a pity for the former clients of these hosters, ‚Äúbecause happiness was so close‚Äù, ‚Äúcommunism should have come just recently‚Äù ... <br>  PPS: I tried to specify all price tags including taxes. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/91466/">https://habr.com/ru/post/91466/</a></p>
