That is, the ideal object for observation is the live broadcast of a large conference. </p><br><p>  And by the way, we have one for you.  This Sunday and Monday, <strong>DotNext 2017 Moscow</strong> is held - the largest conference in Russia dedicated to the development on the .NET platform.  Three dozen speakers will make presentations on the present and future of the .NET platform, on optimizing performance and multithreading, on the internal structure of the .NET platform and the CLR, on profiling and debugging of the .NET code, and so on. </p><br><p>  And you have the opportunity to participate in this - without having to go somewhere or go through half the city, on YouTube, for free.  How exactly - read on. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/3p/20/tt/3p20tt9ptjp36c5_kgtgz3v08je.png"></p><a name="habracut"></a><br><h1 id="changelog">  Changelog </h1><br><p>  First, many already know that the JUG.ru Group has begun to conduct open broadcasts, have been to several, and want improvements relative to the past. </p><br><p>  And we really improved a lot.  Recently, several conferences have <a href="https://devoops.ru/">taken</a> place, such as <a href="https://jokerconf.com/">Joker</a> , <a href="https://devoops.ru/">DevOops</a> , <a href="https://smartdataconf.ru/">SmartData</a> , the technology has run in, and now the current stage of evolution can be observed at <a href="https://dotnext-moscow.ru/">DotNext 2017 Moscow</a> : </p><br><ul><li>  Improved sound quality.  Microphones stand correctly and work better, the acoustics of the hall are thought out, minor technical problems are solved; </li><li>  Video at 1440p - the extra space is used to simultaneously display the speaker and FullHD slides (or the laptop screen for live coding) in one screen; </li><li>  Infrastructure for working with video moved to the cloud, which lowered the probability of equipment failures.  (In fact, basically, they are engaged in this at <a href="http://sbtg.ru/">SBTG.ru</a> , which help in recording the conference, and we are only reaping the fruits of their work); </li><li>  In the intervals between presentations, when speakers and participants on the site are retired to the discussion zones, we show the online broadcast to the audience reports and interviews with speakers and sponsors.  This time the interview should be livelier; two presenters will lead them ( <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/phillennium">@phillennium</a> and <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/olegchir">@olegchir</a> - you can regularly see our posts on Habr√©); </li><li>  Many minor technical problems were solved, which most did not even notice, but they were there.  In general, the feeling of watching the broadcast should be better. </li></ul><br><h1 id="kak-podklyuchitsya">  How to connect </h1><br><p>  Just save yourself these YouTube links.

Of course, we use <a href="https://github.com/vlsi/confplanner">ConfPlanner</a> , created with the participation of <a href="https://jokerconf.com/">Vladimir Sitnikov</a> .  ConfPlanner works on the basis of <a href="http://www.optaplanner.org/">OptaPlanner</a> and automatically tries to ensure that all the direct participants in the conference are included in the reports that they indicated in the survey.  But nevertheless, the results of the work of automatics are creatively analyzed by the organizers, based on the understanding that the participants of the open broadcast will watch the first hall.  The sequence of reports of the first hall has its own internal logic. </p><br><p>  Participants' questions ( <em>those who watch for free, too</em> ) are taken into account, you can ask them in the <a href="https://t.me/dotnextconf">official telegram channel of the</a> conference.  It is recommended to understand Telegram in advance.

And for all the others, we traditionally post them in 3-4 months. </li><li>  You cannot watch what happens in other halls.  And there will be many interesting things.

In functional programming, there are ways that are much simpler and more efficient. </p><br><p>  In this report, Mark will consider the use of dependency injection in classic object-oriented design and explain why it is not necessary (even undesirable) to use it in functional programming.  Following this, it will be clearly shown how the use of functional programming by the technique eliminates the need to use mocks and stubs in unit testing, and allows you to completely eliminate garbage from a direct listing of dependencies. <br><br clear="all"></p><br><hr><br><h2 id="high-performance-networking-in-net-corehttpsdotnext-moscowru2017msktalks3hcuoycrw4egcs0mkewoio">  <a href="https://dotnext-moscow.ru/2017/msk/talks/3hcuoycrw4egcs0mkewoio/">High performance Networking in .NET Core</a> </h2><br><p>  <em>Karel Zikmund, Microsoft</em> </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ep/ph/d7/epphd7mm-3i_e7oqb-ovq1ffj-u.jpeg" width="200" align="left">  In the top of performance, there are two reports on network performance. </p><br><p>  The first of them is led by Karel Zikmund, an English-speaking speaker, known for being the Software Engineering Manager in the .NET Framework team and the .NET Core, and is the CoreFX manager for Networking, Crypto, Collections, Process, etc. </p><br><p>  Karel will talk about the architecture and the specific implementation of the .NET Core network stack, especially about performance and portability.

Like any other isolated module, microservice can be easily replaced or rewritten, or even horizontally scaled without the risk of regressions.  Microsevreis can be loosely coupled part of a distributed architecture, but they can be used separately, by themselves.  This architecture has many advantages, and not so many disadvantages.  More importantly, it is more common than it is customary to talk about.  ‚ÄúMicroservices‚Äù is just a special name for anything that is not a well-developed, comprehensive system. </p><br><p>  In this report, Dino will share with us the painful experience of developing a microservice architecture, during which his company built the infrastructure in many stages, having very limited resources, collecting the results by brick and trying to ensure that when adding new Kripikov, the old ones would not fall off . </p><br><p>  Dino is a well-known trainer, consultant and evangelist, a CTO of a rapidly growing IT company.  He has written many well-known books for Microsoft Press.

And both - about cross-platform applications. </p><br><p>  The first report is led by Sasha Goldstein - an outstanding performance engineer who invariably occupies top positions at all conferences, no matter where he speaks.  We interviewed him several times, I advise you to familiarize yourself with: a <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/jugru/blog/283582/">couple of videos of 2015</a> , <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/jugru/blog/314224/">videos of 2016</a> , <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/jugru/blog/320620/">interviews about working with a performance,</a> and a <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/jugru/blog/328294/">review of the tools of the .NET performance engineer</a> . </p><br><p> In this report, Sasha will talk about the following.  Imagine having managed to run your favorite ASP.NET application on Linux or even something with a console interface.  What's next?  A happy ending?  Oh no.  In fact, you will have to face memory leaks, strange crashes, performance problems, and many other troubles - and what to do when it all happens in production?  On Windows, we have a bunch of interesting tools, but they won't work in Linux, and there are no simple alternatives yet.  In this report, Sasha will talk about how debugging and profiling of .NET Core applications on Linux now look like.  How to investigate using <code>perf</code> , how <code>LTTNG</code> used as a replacement for <code>ETW</code> events, how to compile and understand LTTNG <code>LTTNG</code> , and much more.  Sasha will talk about collecting <em>core dumps</em> , and how to get information interesting for the .NET developer using <code>lldb</code> and <code>SOS</code> .  This report will be a very difficult journey through the wilds of unfinished utilities and special command line magic, but in the end we will come to a happy end!

Let us figure out how to understand what optimization to use, and what problems usually arise when optimizing the database code.  Many of these techniques were invented and polished to a mirror shine when developing <em>RavenDB 4.0</em> - a fresh version of the NoSQL engine for the .NET platform.  <em>RavenDB</em> is a rather complicated thing, in which optimization has been going on for nanoseconds for a long time, and it is necessary to optimize in time, IO and processor simultaneously.  Most of the techniques discussed in this report can be applied anywhere, regardless of language or framework. </p><br><p>  Federico went a long way to be able to tell about his discoveries.  He is not only a co-founder of Corvalius and Codealike, but he has actually worked on the performance of algorithms for the last ten years, using both CPU and all kinds of tricky hardware like GPUs as hardware.  This is a person who is not afraid of working with binary data, registers and low-level optimization, and at the same time fascinated by the technology of parallelism and modern computer graphics.  In general, if anyone can tell a report on low-level optimizations in C #, then this is it. <br><br clear="all"></p><br><hr><br><h2 id="runtime-code-generation-techniques-in-real-life-scenarioshttpsdotnext-moscowru2017msktalks1zii5rwvmmokc0wiigqaw8">  <a href="https://dotnext-moscow.ru/2017/msk/talks/1zii5rwvmmokc0wiigqaw8/">Runtime code generation techniques in real life scenarios</a> </h2><br><p>  <em>Raffaele Rialdi, Vevy Europe</em> </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/kx/pl/rj/kxplrjh1arrgbyqo5gwfa3qfzlo.jpeg" width="200" align="left">  Code generation in runtime is a very powerful and well-studied technique, but many developers are still reluctant to use it.  Usually the study of <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/concepts/expression-trees/">Expression Trees</a> begins with some simple example of how to create a predicate (filter) or a mathematical expression.  But not the Expression Trees single .NET developer is alive.  Most recently, it was possible to generate code using the compiler itself ‚Äî this is done using the Roslyn / CodeAnalisys library APIs, which, among other things, also provide parsing, crawling, and source generation. </p><br><p>  In this report, we, together with Rafael, will analyze the real ways of using code generation.  In some cases, they can greatly improve the performance of the application, which in turn leads us to a dilemma - if the generated code is so useful and we are going to use it often, how can we debug this code?  This is one of the fundamental questions that arise in real projects. </p><br><p>  Rafael is a practicing architect, consultant and speaker with MVP in the Developer Security category since 2003, which right now has been involved in enterprise project backends, specializing in code generation and cross-platform development for C # and C ++.  In other words, Raphael is the person to whom almost any question about code generation can be asked in the discussion area, and not only about .NET, and he will most likely answer. <br><br clear="all"></p><br><hr><br><h2 id="life-liberty-and-the-pursuit-of-apiness-the-secret-to-happy-codehttpsdotnext-moscowru2017msktalks4ptxeq6flmeeqekygw4iws">  <a href="https://dotnext-moscow.ru/2017/msk/talks/4ptxeq6flmeeqekygw4iws/">Life, liberty and the pursuit of APIness: the secret to happy code</a> </h2><br><p>  <em>Dylan Beattie, Spotlight</em> </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/eb/h0/f0/ebh0f0cwprj9-sdls5fnaabqlom.jpeg" width="200" align="left">  This will be a very philosophical, and at the same time, a purely practical report.  He will be led by Dylan Beattie - a person with so many work achievements and interesting projects that it is easier to read the full list <a href="https://dotnext-moscow.ru/2017/msk/talks/4ptxeq6flmeeqekygw4iws/">on our website</a> .  In the context of the report, it is interesting that Dylan is a system architect who right now is working on building complex modern distributed applications and, accordingly, on developing the right APIs for them.  And he will probably play us on the guitar, at a party after the first day of DotNext with Vagif. </p><br><p>  But back to the report.  The point is that we have been working all our life on systems created by other people.  Starting from a simple UI on the phone, and ending with the cloud infrastructure of the modern Internet - the interaction between systems and users is the foundation for our understanding of the technology and sensations from its use.  If you build the right interaction, users will be happy and will work productively.  If the platform leaves only bad impressions, it only leads to inefficiency, fear and anguish from using such a product. </p><br><p>  Whether we are aware or not, every time we create new programs, we also create user experience.  People will interact with our code ‚Äî as end users, or maybe as members of the development team.  Or maybe they are mobile application developers using your API, or is it someone who needs to go to the night to fix the problems that have arisen.  From the outside, this may seem like quite different cases, but in fact they have something in common.  Dylan calls this the word " <em>discoverability</em> ."  (I do not specifically translate this word, because the report will still be in English, and in English it has more meanings than the Russian equivalent of ‚Äúintelligibility‚Äù). </p><br><p>  In this report, Dylan outlines ideas and discoveries relating to user experience, API design, psychology and psychology of learning, and shows how you can integrate the idea of <em>discoverability</em> at all architectural levels of the application.  There will be illustrations on real big projects, with explanations of how <em>discoverability</em> works with different interaction paradigms.  It doesn't matter if you create databases or system libraries, hypermedia API or mobile applications - one day there will be a moment when someone starts interacting with your code - and when this happens - it‚Äôs better that they are satisfied, right? <br><br clear="all"></p><br><hr><br><h2 id="provaydery-tipov-bez-boli-i-magiihttpsdotnext-moscowru2017msktalks50ktyyngfsuoqeqmiykkw6">  <a href="https://dotnext-moscow.ru/2017/msk/talks/50ktyyngfsuoqeqmiykkw6/">Providers of types without pain and magic</a> </h2><br><p>  <em>Roman <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/nevoroman/" class="user_link">Nevoroman</a> Nevolin, EPAM</em> </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/n5/lr/3w/n5lr3wauaezus5n6ndhha2nkn5q.jpeg" width="200" align="left">  <code>Newtonsoft.Json</code> is the most popular package in NuGet.  And next to it, in third place, is the Entity Framework.  Perhaps this is a good demonstration of how often .NET developers process a variety of data.  And for each type of data - its own library, and a bunch of wrapper classes that you have to write in order to obtain all the benefits of strict typing.  And this should be done for each new data source. </p><br><p>  However, F # offers us another solution to the eternal problem - type providers.  A solution that allows you to maximally simplify work with any data types, get rid of writing and maintaining classes of wrappers, and at the same time solve completely different problems, like drawing complex graphs and working with neural networks with F # tools. </p><br><p>  If you want to know how to use type providers, what problems they solve, how they work and how to write your own provider for your tasks, come to this report! </p><br><p>  <strong>Knowing F # is optional</strong> .

What will be considered art?  How will we do the usual things, how will we do business? </p><br><p>  Dino will tell us a story - a fictional story - which can be considered science fiction.  Or a special cellular fiction.  In 2008, one guy made Bitcoin.  To manage Bitcoin, you need to use a common registry - Blockchain.  Blockchain is a public registry for transactions - in the future, transactions of any type.  Imagine that someone went further, on a couple of levels.  Blockchain spread throughout the world, and became the basis for absolutely everything.  Banks, notaries, government - in short, any third-party certifying authorities - were on the verge of disaster. </p><br><p>  Imagine that in 2048 the whole world turned out to be entirely based on Blockchain, and any transaction in it is visible, traceable and verifiable by anyone.  Imagine a world in which people dress in RFID-connected clothing connected to Blockchain.  Any step you take is also monitored (by the way, now they are watching 2017 too!).  Your location is well known to everyone, all the actions I recorded.  Imagine a world in which computers deal with most of the most tedious tasks you‚Äôve ever met in life - they make decisions for you, drive a car for you, order plane tickets for you, buy different things for you - and even write for you programs. </p><br><p>  Imagine a world in which only thoughts and dreams are all truly yours, and they are the only pleasant thing that you still have.  (No, I do not think that computers will have sex for you, even in 2048!).  Will it be utopia or anti-utopia?  A world without deception, envy and crime.  Full of honesty, freedom, love.  (And yes, free love is like the kind that hippies dreamed of in the 70s, but much better).  Time will tell, and time flies very quickly. </p></div>
