When you first dive into the topic, we found out that we would have to choose from 30+ options.  In any case, so many found on the Internet.  I didn‚Äôt want to understand everything in detail, and there was little time.  Therefore, they learned from counterparties what they use.  This helped to narrow the number of applicants to 7 of the most popular. </p><br><p>  So, consider the services: </p><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d97/820/5b7/d978205b7cb0bb5b8f5e90e7f98667ce.png" alt="image"></div><br><p>  If you need the history of development companies, rummage through the sites (links in the <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/448666/">sources</a> ).  Spoiler: it is similar for everyone - started as services for tax reporting, then began to provide services for the exchange of electronic documents between counterparties.  Exceptions: Courier Sphere and E-COM - initially worked as EDI providers, Synerdocs - grew out of the internal workflow system.  And finally, there is an important difference between the products from Taxcom and Kaluga. Astral - they are built into the solution from 1C. </p><br><p>  Compared by the following parameters: </p><br><p>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/448666/">1. Minimum rates</a> </p><br><p>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/448666/">2. Availability of demo access</a> </p><br><p>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/448666/">3. Technical support</a> </p><br><p>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/448666/">4. Integration</a> </p><br><p>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/448666/">5. Mobile solution</a> </p><br><p>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/448666/">6. Exchange in roaming</a> </p><br><a name="1"></a><br><h2>  1. Minimum rates </h2><br><p>  Collect data about services began with the cost of services.  And here I have two news for you.  Good - absolutely all incoming traffic from all operators is free, you will only be asked for money for outgoing documents.  The bad - to deal with the prices that are listed on the sites, it is very difficult.  And all because the pricing and the principle of payment for all services are built in different ways. </p><br><p>  I note immediately that they considered only the minimum rates.  We do not have a lot of counterparties, the volume of workflow is not very large, and I didn‚Äôt want to spend a lot of money at the start. </p><br><h3>  Contour.Diakad </h3><br><p>  The minimum rate for 900 rubles.  includes 100 documents.  It allows you to exchange documents only with counterparties, the operator of the electronic document flow of which is SKB Kontur.  In this case, the client can purchase the ‚ÄúMinimum‚Äù tariff plan no more than once a year. </p><br><h3>  Taxcom / 1C: EDO </h3><br><p>  There are two options of work on which the payment for the services of the operator depends.  If you use the 1C-EDI solution, then the price is set by the 1C franchisee in your city.  We did not manage to get through the week.  The second version of the work - directly, without reference to 1C.  In this case, as we understood, the minimum package for a year will cost 1,800 rubles.  and include 150 outgoing messages (in each - a package of documents, including 1 invoice). </p><br><h3>  VLSI </h3><br><p>  Minimum package - 500 rubles.  per year, the limit is 50 packages per quarter.  The package may include any types of documents and in any quantity, but each must contain no more than 1 invoice.  Take payment for connection to the service - 500 rubles. </p><br><h3>  Synerdocs </h3><br><p>  Tariffs start from 2050 rub.  for 300 documents.  Calculated for the year. </p><br><h3>  Kaluga.Online / 1C: EDO </h3><br><p>  The minimum rate will be 1200 rubles.  for 300 outgoing messages per year.  Anything over - 10 rubles.  per piece  In one message (package, set) may include 1 invoice and 2 related documents. </p><br><h3>  Sphere Courier </h3><br><p>  For connection to the service, if you are not from retail, you will have to pay separately - from 300 rubles (250 + VAT).  At a minimum rate of 300 rubles.  (250 + VAT) you will receive 50 outgoing.  Documents above the tariff are paid higher - 7 rubles each.  per piece  Rates are valid for a month. </p><br><h3>  E-com </h3><br><p>  The minimum fare is 4000 rubles.  It includes 500 outgoing documents per month. </p><br><p>  In terms of 1 document in the minimum tariff received: </p><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/288/e6c/7ce/288e6c7ce21cddf772072ca522cf1ec6.png" alt="image"></div><br><a name="2"></a><br><h2>  2. Availability of demo access </h2><br><p>  It is not possible to see how the work in the service looks from the inside.  Some sites explicitly registered the service (Kontur.Diadok, Synerdocs, VLSI), and somewhere had to try: Sphere.Courier - requested via online chat, in E-COM login / password from the test version provided after talking on the phone .  Could not test Kaluga.Online / 1C: EDM and Taxcom / 1C: EDM. </p><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a70/419/33f/a7041933f73422713b191b9781f2b4b5.png" alt="image"></div><br><a name="3"></a><br><h2>  3. Technical support </h2><br><p>  Mode of operation stated on the website: </p><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/20a/7e5/810/20a7e5810874f6421bbb27d267a7c765.png" alt="image"></div><br><p>  For the sake of interest, they called the specified support numbers at 19.00 Moscow time.  In Kontur.Diak phoned, though not very quickly.  In Kaluga.Online / 1C: EDO, Synerdocs - no problem, in E-COM - silence, but something interesting happened with VLSI - they hit the regional partner of the company (nobody picked up the phone at that time).  And on the night from Saturday to Sunday, those who declare the 24/7 regime were recruited.  Result: phoned only to Taxcom / 1C: EDM. </p><br><p>  What else did you find out about tech support: </p><br><h3>  Contour.Diakad </h3><br><p>  Diagnostics and adjustment of the workplace is carried out using Contour.Plugina.  Other settings with the connection of a specialist are paid separately - from 2600 rubles.  at one o'clock. </p><br><h3>  Taxcom / 1C: EDO </h3><br><p>  There is an online assistant on the site.  You can select the time of the call (depending on the load of support engineers). </p><br><h3>  VLSI </h3><br><p>  There is software for remote connection specialist VLSI. </p><br><h3>  Synerdocs </h3><br><p>  Uses a utility for setting up a workplace (Helper).  Initial configuration is free. </p><br><h3>  Kaluga.Online / 1C: EDO </h3><br><p>  Workplace customizes partner.  Departure or remote connection are charged separately. </p><br><h3>  Sphere Courier </h3><br><p>  There is a single software installer that allows you to install and configure the utility required to work with an electronic signature, Courier, Reporting services.  There are 3 tariffs for technical support.  One free, the rest - for extra money.  Although the term for resolving issues is less. </p><br><h3>  E-com </h3><br><p>  From the buns: a separate manager is assigned to the company for free (give his mobile). </p><br><a name="4"></a><br><h2>  4. Integration </h2><br><p>  First of all, it was important for us whether there is integration with 1C.  It turned out that everyone has it.  Here are just in almost all cases paid. </p><br><p>  The minimum cost of integration with 1C per year: </p><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/dd6/5e3/d1c/dd65e3d1c019cf5f16322869d2570cab.png" alt="image"></div><br><h3>  Contour.Diakad </h3><br><p>  The cost of integration with 1C - 11 800 rubles per year.  Setting up with standard configurations - plus 2300, with atypical configurations - from 10,000. Anything that goes beyond the basic integration solution is charged additionally. </p><br><h3>  Taxcom / 1C: EDO </h3><br><p>  Integrated into 1C-EDO module.  You can exchange documents with counterparties if you have a 1C: ITS subscription.  The price sets 1C - from 17 000 to 55 000 rubles.  in year. </p><br><h3>  VLSI </h3><br><p>  To work must be connected tariff from 6000 rubles.  in year.  Any modifications are paid separately. </p><br><h3>  Synerdocs </h3><br><p>  It is provided free of charge with tariff packages from 1000 documents. </p><br><h3>  Kaluga.Online / 1C: EDO </h3><br><p>  Everything, as in Taxcom. </p><br><h3>  Sphere Courier </h3><br><p>  Paid - from 6 000 rubles.  in year. </p><br><h3>  E-com </h3><br><p>  Paid - from 12 500 per year. </p><br><p>  And a little more about integration: </p><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/463/ea8/87f/463ea887fd48f1bde3798014200b7680.png" alt="image"></div><br><a name="5"></a><br>
<h2>  5. Mobile solution </h2><br><p>  It seems that not the most popular feature among the services for the exchange of electronic documents.  We found out only that there is an application on iOS and Android in Contour.  Plus Synerdocs offers mobile Viber and SMS solutions for signing documents, and VLSI - for notification of new documents.  For other services there is no information. </p><br><a name="6"></a><br><h2>  6. Exchange in roaming </h2><br><p>  Finally, talk about the most interesting.  As in the mobile communication, in the electronic document flow there are difficulties with the interaction of subscribers in roaming.  Only it is not about services outside the service area.  In the case of document flow, roaming implies the possibility of exchanging documents between customers of different operators. </p><br><p>  Again, there are more than 30 services in Russia. And not everyone has a roaming connection configured with each other.  You can see who the EDO operator already has, <a href="http://roseu.org/roaming">here</a> . </p><br><p>  On the one hand, almost all operators are connected to roaming centers - platforms that provide secure exchange of invoices between customers of different services.  On the other hand, the readiness of the operators themselves to set up roaming is different for everyone.  Judging by the experience of our partners, the process is delayed in the case of Kontur.Dyadok and Taxcom / 1C: EDI, faster - VLSI and Synerdocs.  For other operators there are no reviews. </p><br><h2>  And a bit of myself </h2><br><p>  Paragraph for those who read to the end.  What service we have chosen in the end, I will not tell.  I can only say that the study was not useful - a large counterparty forced us to connect to his exchange service.  Nobody in the company expected such a finale of this story. </p><br><a name="7"></a><br><p>  Sources: </p><br><ol><li>  <a href="https://www.diadoc.ru/">Kontur.Dyadok website</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://taxcom.ru/dokumentooborot/">Site Taxcom / 1C: EDO</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://sbis.ru/">VLSI website</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://www.synerdocs.ru/">Synerdocs website</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://taxcom.ru/dokumentooborot">Site Kaluga.Online / 1C: EDO</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://www.esphere.ru/products/courier">Sphere Courier website</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://exite.ru/">E-COM website</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://roseu.org/roaming">ROSEU</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://ecm-journal.ru/docs/Obmen-ehlektronnymi-dokumentami-Sravnenie-servisov-ot-ECM-Journal.aspx">ECM-Journal Study</a> </li></ol></div>
