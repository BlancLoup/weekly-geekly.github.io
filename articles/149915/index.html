I <a href="https://epgu.gosuslugi.ru/pgu/service/10000018733_57.html">cite</a> references <a href="https://epgu.gosuslugi.ru/pgu/service/10000018733_57.html">link1</a> and <a href="https://epgu.gosuslugi.ru/pgu/service/10000018733_56.html">link2</a> , I managed to determine <a href="https://epgu.gosuslugi.ru/pgu/service/10000018733_56.html">what</a> I needed only on the last page of the service receipt wizard, I need to attach an application for state registration (for registration I need a document with the number P21001, a different document number is suggested for the wrong link). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4ea/3ae/e3b/4ea3aee3b90f30d38d2e61c147733cbf.jpg">

      To fill out an application, you need to know the number of your ‚Äútax‚Äù, the link that is given on the first page <a href="http://service.nalog.ru:8080/addrno.do">‚ÄúDetermining the details of the</a> tax <a href="http://service.nalog.ru:8080/addrno.do">inspectorate‚Äù</a> never opens, it is not clear why they indicated port 8080 in it, without specifying the port it‚Äôs very <a href="https://service.nalog.ru/addrno.do">easy to</a> find out your tax authority.  Next you need to download the program <a href="http://www.nalog.ru/el_usl/no_software/ppdrip/">‚ÄúPreparation of documents for IP‚Äù program</a> , it is worth considering that you do not need to fill in the fields ‚ÄúIndividual entrepreneur data (filled in Latin letters)‚Äù, for some reason there is an asterisk in the document (which means that these fields need to be filled only by foreigners) and in the program it is not specified.  In principle, there are no difficulties with this program, it is necessary to unload the document from it that needs to be attached on the last page (P21001). <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I submitted my first application on 23.07.2012 11:49, almost instantly the answer came: <br><br> <code>     . <br>    : 230712-425051. <br>               . <br>       - 7610</code> <br> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7a4/55f/c93/7a455fc93a817d2be435e153f6466b70.jpg"><br><br>  The application received stutus "executed".  Very quickly paid the fee through the terminal in the Savings Bank, came to the tax office, but they did not find my application there (to be honest, they didn‚Äôt even know that this was possible at first, but the girl called and told her where to look), asked to leave a phone number and will find the call back.  What do you think called? <br><br>  There was no answer, I decided maybe lost, anything happens, I sent another one after 4 days (07/27/2012 12:31), there was another girl in the tax office who also could not find the application, I had a reasonable question what to do ?  The answer was simple - fill in by hand and come.  But I didn‚Äôt want to give up like this (it‚Äôs already 2 times I‚Äôve got to go to tax), I decided to call a toll-free number and resolve this issue, listened very carefully and said that they would send the application to the technical specialists and decide everything and assigned a unique number.  After another 4 days (01.08.2012) a letter arrived: <br><br> <code>      INC000000109706            ,     ,     .</code> <br> <br>  The next day (08/02/2012 11:00) I made another application and sent them the data that they requested and waited, a week went by no action, wrote a letter to support@gosuslugi.ru, did not answer it, called after a couple of days I was told that the question is being solved and takes time and that they will contact me.  It took 5 days to call again, the same story, asked me to at least call the terms of solving the difficulties (he worked with software support, I consider it quite normal to call the terms of solving the malfunctions) I was told that they would leave a note that they were interested in the problem and that they would contact and indicated the timeline, what do you think contacted?  Silence again, calling today (08/20/2012) I am told the same text, I ask you to call me the dates, again the same thing that they will be given to the specialists, but no reaction.  Already decided to submit documents in the usual way, I decided to complain at last and fill out a review about the services, but my surprise when I chose the item about the service as a ‚Äúdisgusting‚Äù one-time code ceased to fit, and then became this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/05c/10d/534/05c10d534bf98ca3062b7388c975594a.jpg"><br><br>  I want to say that a month ago I filled out a form with a positive review and there were no problems, maybe a coincidence. <br>  These are the pies.  I would like to ask, did anyone register an IP through public services, or am I the first one and they don‚Äôt really work and they are in a hurry to realize this possibility? <br><br>  <b>PS</b> Useful links for official appeal to the right bodies: <br>  <a href="http://www.nalog.ru/customs_union/">Contact the Federal Tax Service of Russia</a> <br>  <a href="http://minsvyaz.ru/ru/directions/questioner/reception/">Contact the Ministry of Communications of Russia</a> <br><br>  <b>UPD</b> : Today (08/21/2012) they called me from the support of the ‚ÄúGosuslugi‚Äù portal and said that they sent another request to the developers about the time frame for solving the problem and that I would be notified of the data by phone and via email. <br>  This is certainly good, but I lost it already a month, I decided to go to the tax office (before that I applied again just yesterday, just in case), as I expected, they did not find anything and said that such applications never came to them (I was the first in my town "lucky").  When I came back a month ago and the application was not found, they told me that they would create a task for local programmers to fix this situation, but apparently they decided to just forget.  I captured the documents in paper form, decided to go through the usual registration procedure, and it turned out that the program ‚ÄúPreparation of documents of IP‚Äù version 2.0.0 does not generate sheet B (Receipt for receipt of documents) and I sent the documents to re-form.  By the way, an example of a document with sheets B is given correctly on the ‚ÄúGosuslugi‚Äù portal and these sheets are formed on third-party services, the conclusion: it is better not to use this program. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/149915/">https://habr.com/ru/post/149915/</a></p>
