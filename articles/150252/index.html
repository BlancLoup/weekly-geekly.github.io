It would seem that everything is saturated with the Internet, social networks have united people, mobile technologies have turned the world around, etc.  But where are the creators of all this magnificence?  Where are the books about them?  Where are the movies, comics?  Where are the posters with outstanding developers over teen beds?  Where are the chewing gum wrappers and brand toys?  Where are the fan clubs and imitators?  There is no this all.  From the books, there is perhaps that <a href="http://lib.rus.ec/b/209550">Nick</a> , and from the movies - the <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A1%25D0%25BE%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D1%2581%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D1%258C_%2528%25D1%2584%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25BC%2529">Social Network</a> (and indeed they are not about programmers, but about magic and business, respectively - it is more interesting for people).  All the rest is either stories about hackers in the spirit of ‚Äúwe will hack the Pentagon in 25 seconds,‚Äù or posts on geek resources like Habr, or financial reports about how much someone has earned money for an IPO.  And why?  And because in the mass consciousness of people the work of a programmer looks uninteresting and boring.  Here it is, as in the picture on the right <br><br>  Table, chair, computer.  From day to day.  Boring  At the same time there are many professions, people who spend the same 90% of the time.  Well, for example, skyscraper architects or spacecraft engineers.  But as a result of the work of the architect, a real building is obtained, which is used by many people; as a result of the engineer‚Äôs work, you get some fashionable rover, which everyone admires.  And the result of the programmer‚Äôs work remains in the same place where the process of its creation took place - in bytes on the computer disk and in the author‚Äôs head.  And because it is not so clearly visible to other people.  And what is noticeable to them?  See picture above. <br><br>  I would like to explain to other people who are not connected with IT technologies that they see nothing at all what is actually happening.  Here you go into the room where five "computer scientists" are sitting.  Everyone is gaining something there, pressing buttons, strenuously staring at the screens.  But it is only their bodies.  They themselves are not here.  And where are they? <br><a name="habracut"></a>

    <h4>  Well, for example, Vasya </h4><br>  Vasya is currently not a junior developer.  Vasya - Assistant Knight, squire.  In the midst of a terrible battle.  His overlord heroically reflects the waves of enemies, is cut one-on-one with terrible opponents, and non-terrible ones are generally mowed down by dozens.  Vasya in admiration!  This is his idol, his ideal, role model.  Vasya himself so far only brings a weapon, and looks after a horse on smoke breaks, but yesterday, yesterday, he was given the opportunity to fight with one not very scary and already slightly wounded opponent.  And he overcame him!  Well, almost, after all, the knight helped a little, suggested ... But next time Vasya will do better!  Will do it yourself!  He already knows how!  He will cope! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/686/a18/1bd/686a181bd2da7af7d4e47e7bcf478ee4.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Or Petya </h4><br>  Peter is not tmlid.  Peter - General Manager of the construction of a new Royal Castle.  The castle is now only in the plans and a little on paper, but standing on the edge of the cliff, Petya already sees an impregnable ditch, soaring up defensive ramparts and snub turrets with purple flags in the corners.  The fortress walls are lit with torches, watchmen walk along them, the inside of the Castle is made elegantly and comfortably, but ... But it still only needs to be done.  And Peter does.  He is engaged in a bunch of things at the same time - you need to complete plans, deliver materials, explain tasks to builders, while it would be good not to go beyond the estimates and deadlines, keep the quality and do a lot of things.  The work moves, obstacles arise - then the foundation is falling apart, the war will start, and in the end it turns out that the castle had to be built in another part of the country.  But all this stuff.  His work, his will and his team - all this leads in the end to the desired result.  The walls, the moat, and the turrets grow into reality, and from now on, any random podorozhny will stop for a minute, admiring the magnificence of the view. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/cd4/1d3/c2a/cd41d3c2a07dcf7e72393d3ef2baf3fc.jpg"><br><br><h4>  But Masha </h4><br>  It would seem - the usual tester.  But no.  Masha - bezopasnik with many years of experience.  A charming smile and a frivolous hairstyle are confusing short-sighted people and give Masha the opportunity to do her job - to suspect everyone around.  Nobody escapes her attention.  She carefully and thoroughly checks the work of everyone - whether a sabotage has crept in, if there is no accidental or intentional harm, or if something has passed by.  Already five times she was alone between ‚ÄúPan‚Äù and ‚ÄúLost‚Äù, and once even a little bit saved the world.  But this is nonsense, it‚Äôs everyday.  This job. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ea1/162/7aa/ea11627aa01bf60d5aa79adbb6a9f8be.jpg"><br><br><h4>  And Slavik </h4><br>  Slavik is not a sysadmin at all, no.  Slavik artist and poet in one person.  And also a musician and a little philosopher.  It seems only at first glance that to set up a large network you only need to know a set of formal rules.  But no.  His work is art.  It, like any art, requires the observance of balance and harmony, requires a sense of artistic taste and flight of fancy, requires innate talent and hard work.  And Slavik works.  The first sketches appear on his canvas, details are added to them, the picture acquires volume, shadows and semitones are added, that's all almost ready and ... And the crumpled draft flies into the basket, over a dozen similar to it, already lying on its bottom.  He was good, but not perfect.  He had barely visible flaws that could be a disaster later.  It all starts in a new way and here in the late night a Masterpiece is born.  He is as beautiful as possible.  Tomorrow he will delight others, inspire them with optimism and bewitch.  It will exist for centuries and will be inherited by descendants. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9a0/017/6b9/9a00176b9f096e03d0fcc8a353f9003e.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Epilogue </h4><br>  I hope these non-folding jigsaw pieces somehow showed what I mean.  Man is what he feels himself to be.  You can see only the body behind the keyboard, but in reality its owner at this moment soars somewhere in the sky on the wings of his fantasy.  Therefore, by the way, do not distract him once more - it will fall and break.  Take your pair of wings better in the locker and join! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/150252/">https://habr.com/ru/post/150252/</a></p>
