Their lectures, reports and speeches will finally allow to outline the contours of the brave new world waiting for us beyond the threshold of mass robotization.  The program of the four days of the forum is <a href="http://mosroboforum.ru/program.shtml">on the site</a> . <br><br>  Just below the list of participants, but first I would like to raise one topic.

      Imagine what would be the world without the First World War?  Probably he would be even more different from what arose.  Peaceful changes are not so visible, but they change life more radically.  If the Caribbean crisis had led to a third world war, we would say that consumer electronics and mass pop culture are the result of a military break, not a household revolution. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/439/272/b7e/439272b7e96bf471b89435e448b73a5c.jpg"><br>  <i>The iPhone could look like this after the Caribbean crisis.</i> <br><br>  Household revolutions will shake the XXI century and XX will soon become a distant, distant past.  Some robots will hit the brain in such a way that it will not seem a little.  This is the collapse of all traditional life in the post-ancient era.  A coup comparable only with the agrarian revolution. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  Take up all this whining of the twentieth century about "slavery".  And what man will face in this century?  With him, dear.  The person will be surrounded by anthropoid robots, which he bought and are fully owned by him.  And he will use them as servants and as sexual objects.  And this will require significant changes in everyday culture and communication culture.  Can you talk to a robot?  Roman - knew how.  And we simply do not have the appropriate "culture of consumption." <br><br>  At the same time, robots will have intelligence and make decisions (otherwise why are they needed?) - but who will be responsible for these decisions?  Now for each drone looks man-operator, but this is for now. <br><br>  Military robots are now filling the land, air and sea, and with each new model, they are becoming more deadly, autonomous and even intelligent.  ‚ÄúThe robots you see today are like the Ford Model T.  We see only the earliest stages of technology development, ‚Äùsaid a high-ranking employee of one of the companies developing robots.  As you know, Henry Ford sold only 239 copies of his super-famous car in the first year - and 15 million over the next 19 years.  The demand for robotic systems is growing unusually fast. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/488/c65/24f/488c6524fd30c7198c4c2263e3e98960.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>without a robot you are a native in a loincloth</i> <br><br>  What will happen in some 2030?  Fortunately, not only do we have such questions.  The government of Great Britain and the USA have already attended to a question.  In 2006, a futurological study on the subject of equipment and robotics was commissioned by the British Science Administration and the Center for the Study of Innovation.  Specialists from <a href="http://www.ipsos-mori.com/">Ipsos-MORI</a> , the <a href="http://www.outsights.co.uk/">Outsights</a> consulting agency and the United States-based <a href="http://www.iftf.org/">Institute for the Future,</a> took part in it. <br><br>  This document states that: <br><br><ol><li>  Mass production of anthropoid robots will begin in about 20 years.  The robots will have artificial intelligence comparable to human intelligence and will be capable of self-programming and self-reproduction. </li><li>  Robots will turn into ‚Äúdigital citizens‚Äù, unlike things that have legal rights and obligations.  Robots will participate in elections, pay taxes and necessarily serve in the army.  By the way, something like a lawsuit in the USSR ‚Äî all jeeps and shepherd dogs were registered at military registration offices and requisitioned in the event of war. </li><li> Obtaining civil rights by robots will take place in several stages and is likely to be accompanied by great social tension.  Similar to the process of granting civil rights to blacks in the United States. </li></ol><br><br>  The study, or at least in its published part, says nothing about the main problem of a robotic society: anthropoid robots make the existence of the overwhelming majority of humanity socially unnecessary.  In addition, the economic gap between a robotic and a conventional state is so deep that it turns the most modern non-robotic state into a reservation of outdated equipment, outdated culture and outdated social relations. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0b2/da9/fb1/0b2da9fb1e110e60a1817edce0479f21.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Military use of robots - these are soldiers, having a demonstration value.  It is about a global turn in an economy equal to the industrial or even agricultural revolution.  With the emergence of robots, the economy will begin to develop itself, without human participation as a production unit.  Carrying a person from their sphere of ekornomiki will turn him into an absolute consumer, and the cost of goods will make it close to zero. <br><br>  At the same time, the anthropomorphic nature of robots is fundamental, because all of the Earth‚Äôs technology is sharpened to the human standard.  In fact, the robot is not a mechanical person with artificial intelligence, but a free (!) Mechanical person with artificial intelligence.  A toy for a billion dollars can be built - that's not the point.  It's not about the manual assembly of gold carriages for a dozen European kings, it's about the Ford T and the assembly line.  The era of robots, this is when out of 8,000,000,000 people, 7,800,000,000 say: Everything is free.  Eat popcorn, watch cartoons. <br><br>  It is interesting to ask how professionals see the future of robots.  Now, actually, the respondents: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7f2/bb5/576/7f2bb557606f041a047ae2d9cd9f5088.jpg"><br><br>  <b>JUN-HO OH (JUN-HO OH) Professor of the leading Korean Institute of Science and Technology, the creator of the robot Hubo / Korea</b> <br><br>  Over the past ten years, he has created a unique model of the humanoid robot series KHR-1, KHR-2, Hubo and Hubo 2, he also developed Albert Hubo and Hubo FX-1.

The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe programmer was implemented through software that supports the algorithm for the movement of a mechanical arm, which is the design of the robot.  At the moment, the activity of Patrick Tresse is aimed at improving his creation and trying to teach him different manners of drawing famous artists, so that in the future the robot has its own style of drawing. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/20b/80e/957/20b80e9570d7cd5d47cc0d0bb396114c.jpg"><br><br>  <b>ADAM BEN-DROR (ADAM BEN-DROR) / Industrial Designer, University of Victoria, Wellington / Australia</b> <br><br>  He studied industrial design at the University of Victoria in Wellington.
