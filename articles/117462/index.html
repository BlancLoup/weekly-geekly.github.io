  <section class="page js-page"><h1>JavaOne / Oracle Develop: General Impressions</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  On April 12-13, at the Russian Academy of Sciences, for the first time in Moscow, a well-known conference of Java and Oracle developers, JavaOne / Oracle Develop, was held.  I visited both days and would like to share my opinion on the reports, which I managed to attend, general impressions and various household trifles <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  <strong>Day 1.</strong> </h4><br>  1. <em>HTML 5 and Java: New Horizons.</em>  The first report was very weak.  It was discussed about already well-known things in HTML 5 and in general what Java is (why is it for people who already know very well what Java is?), And not a word about how they are connected and what advantages this tandem gives.  Did not like. <br>  2. <em>Report from Deutsche bank</em> on writing applications with low-latency.  In general, a good performance.  How to write in C-style in Java :) <br>  3. <em>Oracle JDeveloper and Oracle ADF: Oracle Fusion software development platform.</em>  Showed all sorts of chips as very quickly to do quite complex applications in JDeveloper, without writing a single line of code.  For 7 minutes, people from scratch made a CRUD application with validation of input data, various graphs.  However, from personal experience, it is hard to believe that everything will be just as beautiful in production.  The saved time will be spent on customization and writing of crutches in places that the developers have not provided. <br>  4. <em>Diagnosing problems and setting up GC in HotSpot JVM for the needs of a specific Java application.</em>  We considered the main models of garbage collectors, when it is better to use which one and in what situations what parameters should be tweaked.  We need to find slides - a very useful reference material. <br>  5. <em>Language Oriented Programming in action.</em>  <em>How we do it in Jet Brains.</em>  In my personal top of all reports - the first place.  Surprisingly cool stuff (even the hand does not rise call it a technology) - MPS.  I don‚Äôt know this is revolution or evolution, but the thing is ahead of its time.  In short - a sort of DSL design system, all sorts of macro constructions, and just the creation and expansion of programming languages.  I will tell you more at the seminar in our office :) <br><br><h4>  <strong>Day 2</strong> </h4><br>  6. <em>JavaFX 2.0.</em>  Somehow initially I did not believe in this technology and the report did not say that I had inspired any hopes about the future of this platform.  They said that 2.0 is actually rewritten from scratch, it will now be a compilation in HTML + JavaScript, like GWT.  Although it may be suitable as a platform for desktop software (UI), well, it will replace String Swing. <br>  7. <em>Development and tuning of a fast-response application for a Java virtual machine.</em>  At first it was all the same thing, that on the GC report and I was even upset that I went, but closer to the end I was told how not to code, so that the application worked well and garbage collection was less expensive. <br>  8. <em>PL / SQL development and unit testing (author's comment: they translated the unit tests in this way) from Oracle SQL Developer 3.0.</em>  We went here because there was nowhere else to go.  I almost fell asleep :) Not a very interesting topic + the lulling voice of a female speaker ... I remember vaguely.  Something about the visual compilation of requests, how to test requests. <br>  9. <em>Developing a compatible API - a genius without villainy.</em>  The second most interesting report, although there were fairly simple things described :) He told what can be done in the API, which is absolutely impossible, what can be done with apprehension.  Quintessence of experience in team testing compatibility of different versions of the JDK. <br><br><h4>  <strong>General impressions.</strong> </h4><br>  In general, I liked it very much.  4 out of 5 points. <br>  <strong>What you liked:</strong> <br><ol><li>  General atmosphere. </li><li>  A large number of javistes, which was not enough for Google Developer Day. </li><li>  Competent and nice speakers with good english.  I did not even take the translation system, although at times it was difficult on GDD without it. </li><li>  Very lively reports in the sense that if they talked about specific things in coding, this was immediately demonstrated live in the IDE. </li><li>  Bonuses in the form of a backpack and other gifts. </li><li>  Afterparty, although also somehow rather weak, I needed more beer, otherwise everyone drank and everyone ran away :) </li></ol><br>  <strong>What did not like:</strong> <br><ol><li>  Catering.  I have not heard any positive feedback regarding nutrition :) Coffee was given only at a certain time, and the Java logo is a cup of coffee.  In addition, the coffee was disgusting, soluble.  Lunch is a separate topic.  150 grams of lettuce, cheese and sausage butters, small Snickers and small juice.  Comments are superfluous.  GDD was a great feeding (barbecue and a bunch of salads for lunch; butera, buns, cookies, soda, natural freshly ground coffee, tea - all this at any time), despite the fact that there was free of charge, but here tickets were bought (not for repulse money, of course, but to weed out freeloaders). </li><li>  Not very good room.  The GDD in this regard was very cool - one big hall with meals, a chill-out and 4 doors along one wall, all on the same floor.  Simple and clear.  Here, even the map did not help.  It was never possible to understand where you are now (this applies to small halls).  If it were not for pointers on the walls - I would hardly have got <br>  generally at least one report. </li></ol><br>  Next time I will definitely go, I hope the organizers will eliminate the annoying flaws! </div>
