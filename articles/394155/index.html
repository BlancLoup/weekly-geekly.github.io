  <section class="page js-page"><h1>RGlobal - automation system of the restaurant network "Receptor"</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hi, we are Alexander Brailovsky, the owner of the <a href="http://cafereceptor.ru/">network of Cafe Receptor</a> and Pavel Smirnov, our IT Director.  Now we have 4 institutions in Moscow, the last two have already opened in the thick of the crisis.  We started and develop with our own money.  As it turns out to grow in all financial and operational parameters even in the aforementioned hell of a crisis, we look to the future with optimism.  Our goal is 100 restaurants in 5 years (both own and open in our franchise). <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ff9/f0a/94b/ff9f0a94b17440e99c0d2bb6dfe9cf50.jpg"></div><br>  To our humble, but from some side and very impressive success, we owe much of our own ERP-system. <br>  About her today we want to talk a little bit. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  We solve the real problems of restaurateurs </h2><br>  Although looking outside at the warm and lamp atmosphere of the ‚ÄúReceptors‚Äù, this is not true, but we rely as much as possible on IT and automation.  We relied on this from the very beginning, so now we have 6 programmers working on RGlobal, a SaaS system for managing restaurants.  Unlike many such decisions, ours was born and grew not in a fevered startup mind, but in a real restaurant.  Therefore, it solves real everyday problems, not fictional ones.  And it does this in the manner that a restaurateur is comfortable, and not a programmer, a startup, an interface designer, or anyone else.  RGlobal is in the development stage, but it has already been implemented in all restaurants of the Receptor chain. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/75c/f3c/d6c/75cf3cd6c68245d88d7707aa0b598bfe.jpg" alt="image">

      We will make this platform part of the ‚ÄúReceptor‚Äù franchise, so that buyers will get a very serious competitive advantage.  This is not something brilliant and overturning the industry, but simply a product that works, rolls around and really helps us manage four restaurants. <br><br>  Since restaurant automation systems perform almost the same role and have a fairly well-established set of features, I will not repeat and just describe the differences of the RGlobal system from all the others. <br><br><h2>  Database level multiplicity </h2><br>  The backend is built on Ruby on Rails, the main feature is support for multi-tenancy at the database level.  In our case, the tenant is not an isolated restaurant, but an enterprise that has a chain of restaurants.  Users on the same page can see and compare various indicators of institutions in real time.  It is also possible to bind a user to different tenants, switching between them takes place in two mouse clicks. <br><br><h2>  Personnel Management </h2><br>  In addition to the banal functions for storing personnel information, recruitment, relocations, rate changes and staffing schedules, there are two very interesting modules in the personnel management section. <br><br>  - <i>Testing staff</i> <br>  Personnel on the site score different kinds of questions for tests on different topics: corporate culture, mnemonics, perfect service, menu knowledge, kitchen standards, etc. Those who are tested can not only take elective tests with a choice of options, but also write their answers.  In the second case, handwriting recognition is used, since not all employees can own typing on the keyboard.  The system gives confidence that all employees possess all the necessary information to work in a single ‚ÄúReceptor‚Äù team. <br><br>  - <i>Chekin system</i> <br>  A useful thing that saves the management from counting the spent shifts of employees and salaries.  To develop this module, it was necessary to get an Apple Developer Enterprise account, with which we were able to publish an application for iPads located in each restaurant.  Upon arrival or departure, each employee enters his personal code, after which the face is photographed with a front-facing camera and time is recorded.  This is all sent to the server through the API, compared with the staffing table of the employee, delays, processing are calculated, the corresponding charges or write-offs occur.  If you have questions about unrecorded shifts, it is enough to show the staff list in which all of his checks will be displayed.  Such accounting is much more stable against particularly tricky employees, than the standard system of time accounting for the access control system. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5ba/f8d/2d3/5baf8d2d384368fcbfe6bd18ab7a330f.png"></div><br><h2>  Nomenclature </h2><br>  The basis of the automation of the restaurant business is the nomenclature, and we have worked very well on it.  As the ‚ÄúReceptor‚Äù is proud of the technological process of cooking, so the IT department is proud of the flow chart system.  For a visual display of semi-finished products and ingredients, we have developed our multi-level tree subsystem.  It also displays the ingredients that make up the semi-finished products, which can also consist of ingredients and semi-finished products.  There are also videotech cards where kitchen staff learn how to cook dishes. <br><br><h2>  Warehouse operations </h2><br>  In developing the cloud storage system, we managed to overcome the need to store and process huge amounts of information.  Here is an example: there are about 1000 ordered goods for cooking, which have their own value for each batch and shelf life.  If you store information for each day at each restaurant warehouse for each tenant, then at the rate of 100 tenants * 10 restaurants * 1000 nomenclatures * 365 days * 5 years = 1,825,000,000 records.  This problem was solved by packing all the information into one JSON record per day for each warehouse, which reduces the number of records by 1,000,000 times. <br><br>  There are real-time elements in the system: for example, when selling dishes via the POS terminal, the RGlobal API is accessed, through which the necessary products are written off, which gives a real picture of the warehouse at any time. <br><br><h2>  Calls (integration with Alloka) </h2><br>  RGlobal is integrated with the Alloka call tracking service.  Restaurants often call, so the owner can both check the speed of responses (and that they pick up the phone at all) and listen to the recordings of conversations. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f46/132/84e/f4613284ef736618e0372d16a52ef29c.png"></div><br><h2>  Accounting Finance </h2><br>  Convenient financial accounting.  Conveniently, everything is visible in one interface, you can easily compare the performance of different restaurants - and even employees.  You can look at the specific checks, the average checks of the waiters ... In general, we are very much confused by the analytics, so in RGlobal there are a lot of reports that reveal business figures in great detail. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6fa/e01/0b0/6fae010b08f355acaef4404bc730b3d7.png"></div><br>  <i>Micro account of all transactions</i> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/fd0/0aa/c71/fd00aac713b3e70eb089c44d34344adf.png"></div><br>  <i>Sales information - every waiter, every table, every check is visible</i> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/545/ad9/2c4/545ad92c4345f47bd7817317b097a2b4.png"></div><br>  <i>Favorite schedule :-)</i> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/eca/dbb/cf0/ecadbbcf06875b018a86b4f7d5ec2bc0.png"></div><br>  <i>Real-time statistics on the work of waiters</i> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9b6/8ef/416/9b68ef416b5dd069cbce3191af499f2d.png"></div><br>  <i>You can even look at paycharte, what dishes the waiter sells most successfully.</i> <br><br><h2>  Conclusion </h2><br>  If you had seen what we started from (tables in Excel and hellish Filemaker), you would appreciate our progress.  RGlobal likes us very much, although, of course, many things are simply not yet ready or not working as they should.  But the system develops with our restaurants and adapts to the management that we implement and cultivate.  If you are also working on similar systems or are simply interested in modern restaurant franchises with a strong IT component, I will be happy to answer your questions.  And I invite everyone to the ‚ÄúReceptor‚Äù :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/394155/">https://habr.com/ru/post/394155/</a></p>
