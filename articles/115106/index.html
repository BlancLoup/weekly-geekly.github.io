Today, Nokia announces the launch of a new mobile phone focused on music lovers and a wide range of users, the <b>Nokia X1-00</b> .  This device will be sold at a retail price of less than ‚Ç¨ 35 and is the best offer in its price category for buyers in emerging markets.  Read on to find out how it stands out from the crowd, even without its distinctive coloring. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  This phone is for a man in love with music.  You probably immediately guessed about this as soon as you saw a massive speaker on the back of the phone with a maximum volume of up to 106 background (the <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A4%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD_%2528%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BA%25D1%2583%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%2529">background</a> is a measure of perceived volume - 106 of them seem to be enough for your window frames to tremble).  The frequency response was tuned in such a way that the sound remains undistorted even at high volume, unlike most mobile phones. <br><br>  Let's see what was created for the Nokia X1-00, and for whom it is intended?  There are two reasons: firstly, due to the fact that the level of ambient noise can sometimes be excessively high, so your phone needs to be a little louder to break through this noise.  Secondly, the field of application of a mobile music player is somewhat broader than is commonly believed - for example, you could use this device as your main home music player.

To control the music capabilities of the phone, it has three separate keys and the ability to create a playlist with one touch.  Also, the device supports microSD memory cards for additional storage of music up to 16 GB.  And finally, the phone has a built-in FM radio for access to news and entertainment programs. <br><br>  We also want to draw your attention to the built-in flashlight in the device.  This is a fairly rare feature in telephones designed for use in the city, where there is always a bit of ambient light, but it is especially important if you live in a place where the power supply system is unreliable or where there is no electricity at all.  For these reasons, the battery life in standby mode reaches 61 days. <br><br>  Another unusual feature is the ability to use up to five phone books.  Why would anyone need such a function?  You may have one phone for the whole family, and it is even possible that your neighbors will also want to use it. <br><br>  Otherwise, the specification of the phone does not contain any special surprises: this is a super-inexpensive and simple device.  The phone belongs to the representatives of the Series 30 line, which can satisfy the basic needs of the buyer and contains the newly created music player application, calendar, clock, calculator, pre-installed games and so on, but it is by no means positioned as a competitor to a smartphone. <br><br>  Dimensions of the device 112.2 x 47.3 x 16 mm, weight 91 g <br><img src="http://admin.conversations.nokia.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Nokia-X1-00_01.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>UPD:</b> I apologize for commenting.
