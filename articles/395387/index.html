      Modern apartments, apartments, cottages, country houses are a complex engineering complex.  The intelligent home is able to take care of the management of energy supply, heating systems, plumbing, ventilation and air conditioning. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  In order for the owner to get the maximum benefit from the use of such systems, their work must be coordinated.  Thus, the batteries will not aimlessly heat the room with the windows open, and the wireless technologies will allow the client to immediately find out about any abnormal situation wherever he is. <br><br>  Smart home technologies have recently attracted an increasing number of people who appreciate comfort and modern technical solutions.  However, it should be noted that the arrangement of the smart home is a crucial step, and the end result largely depends on how well the preparation for the selection, installation and commissioning of all systems was carried out. <br><br>  One of the options for creating a smart home are DIY-solutions, when the user independently assembles and connects smart devices.  Typically, these solutions are offered out of the box, and they do not require adjustment. <br><br>  However, professional systems, which are called Custom Install, are of more interest - professional companies are engaged in their installation and configuration, moreover, the design of such solutions is often consistent at the construction stage of a house. <br><br>  A smart home should not initially be designed as an autonomous system.  It is necessary to foresee ways of its interaction with higher-level systems, for example, building management systems, emergency systems, as well as systems for accounting resources and content delivery.  It turns out that it is worthwhile to immediately lay the opportunity for interaction with the outside world in order to ensure the high quality of the services provided to the user. <br><br>  That is why the design of the smart home system is just as important as the design of the building itself, in which it will be installed.  Of course, in the event of an error, the consequences will not be fatal, but occasional shortcomings in the operation of air conditioners and shutting down the water supply due to an incorrectly installed leakage sensor will not allow full use of the room. <br><br>  Prevent possible problems in only one way: to make a project.  Undoubtedly, there is a possibility that during the time from drawing up to putting the house into operation, the owners may receive additional requests, so a competent plan should always have the potential for some expansion of the system so that it does not have to ‚Äúshovel‚Äù everything that has already been done. <br><br>  In the ideal case, the design of a smart home system should begin simultaneously with the design of the building itself (or apartment), since quite a large number of electrical and signal cables are involved in this system, and it will not work to hide them under plaster. <br><br>  In addition, it is necessary to provide not only places for equipment, which will definitely require ventilation, but also secret hatches for access to cable routes at key points.  Thus, already at the initial design stage, an architect and a design engineer should work together. <br><br>  The first step in this work is the creation of a draft design.  It should describe all the tasks that the system will perform.  This information is necessary for the preliminary selection of equipment, the characteristics of which, in turn, may affect the characteristics of the entire system. <br><br>  The design of the smart home control system is based on customer requests.  The answer to each request is a device that performs a particular task.  The combination of such devices is the periphery of the smart home.  The components of the system are sensors that provide information on the state of objects in the physical world, actuators that provide an impact on the state of objects in the real world according to commands. <br><br>  It also includes data acquisition and command transmission networks that receive data from sensors and issue commands to actuators, and a storage system that stores, for example, the status of sensors and actuators. <br><br>  Another component of the smart home control system is to include the client application and the intelligent core - a software system that is responsible for the operation of smart devices. <br><br>  It is important to remember that one of the important problems is to ensure the connectivity of sensors and actuators with the core of the control system.  The communication system must provide reliable identification of active devices, have sufficient bandwidth, and also support easy integration of new devices. <br><br>  There are three ways to organize such a network: use wireless technologies, lay special wires or use power cables.  Wireless systems come in two forms: fixed topology and mesh networks.  The first option is a classic network that is designed and deployed manually. <br><br>  The second option is more promising and is a self-tuning peer-to-peer network based on Z-Wave, ZigBee, Bluetooth, etc. As for wired systems, they are built on the basis of serial protocols, such as 1-wire.  Their obvious disadvantage is the need to install special cables. <br><br>  Having gathered all the necessary information about the system, it is possible to draw up a technical design assignment - this is the second stage.  It is important that the customer at the time of the preparation of the TOR already has an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe cost of the system and the functions that it can perform. <br><br>  After drawing up the technical specification, the third stage begins - this is the development of a detailed project that includes all the documentation: a set of construction drawings, equipment specifications, a work schedule, etc. Here the installers, adjusters, architect, designer and other specialists work side by side that allows you to quickly take into account the wishes of the owners. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/59a/b81/fc4/59ab81fc4ee84bd587e6cc6ece122399.jpeg" width="500"><br><br>  The result of the project is a complete set of documents on an established system that meets the needs of the owners and takes into account the specifics of a particular house or apartment.  The client receives in his hands a detailed specification of the equipment and functional diagrams, as well as drawings, cable journal, electrical and instrument cabinets, etc. <br><br>  Today, technological progress has brought more and more new goods and conveniences into our lives, filling the everyday life of every modern person with various innovations.  Touched these technological innovations and spheres of life. <br><br>  The natural desire of man for comfort was the impetus for the development of a high-tech system with the help of which it became possible to exercise centralized control of all the equipment in the house.  Competent design systems and the use of technology allows you to fully enjoy the benefits possessed by a smart home, and to equip the home of your dreams. <br><br>  Other materials from our blog: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/gsgroup/blog/276924/">Smart museum and smart hotel as part of a smart city</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/gsgroup/blog/276864/">Integration of smart home with mobile applications</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/gsgroup/blog/276630/">Smart residential monitoring technology</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/gsgroup/blog/276522/">Smart home and television</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/gsgroup/blog/267176/">Smart Home: Development and Trends</a> </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/395387/">https://habr.com/ru/post/395387/</a></p>
