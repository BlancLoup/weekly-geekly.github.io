Philbrick, working at the Foxboro Corporation, developed analog process control simulation models with vacuum tubes and passive elements.  Philbrick developed many interesting circuits, and some were the ancestors of the operational amplifier. <br><br>  Although amplifiers using both feedback and feedback were improved in the late 1930s and throughout the 1940s, several very interesting developments in the field of differential amplifiers are worth noting. <br><br>  In the 30s there was a need for low level signals from living tissue.  For this purpose, various tube amplifiers were used, such amplifiers were often called ‚Äúbiological amplifier‚Äù. <br><br>  In <b>1934,</b> <i>V. HC Matthews</i> , a biologist by profession, described a differential amplifier circuit.  The amplifier did have differential inputs, but since the common cathodes were tied directly to the common power supply, it is not optimized to minimize the difference in the <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A1%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D1%2584%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B7%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25B9_%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB">common-mode</a> voltage at the inputs.  Note that in those days common mode signals are often referred to as push-push signals, to designate phase signals at both inputs. <br><br>  In <b>1936,</b> <i>Alan Blumlein</i> developed the ideas of Matthews, by shifting the common cathodes of a differential pair through total resistance to the ground.  Alan Blumlein received a patent for his amplifier, but the patent concerned broadband signals, not biological ones.  However, this was a definite step forward compared to the Matthews amplifier, as it provides better detection of common-mode error.  Diagrams of the Matthews and Blumlein amplifiers are shown in fig.  2 <br><br> <a href=""><img height="312" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a8c/77f/fd6/a8c77ffd6910af67d6f2448ab9c7cc2f.jpg" width="600"></a> <br><br>  Fig.  2.

Scheme and list of components of the summing amplifier. <br><br>  This design uses three vacuum tubes to achieve a gain of 90 dB and is controlled by a voltage of ¬± 350 V. The circuit has a single inverting input, rather than differential inverting and non-inverting inputs, as is often found in today's operational amplifiers.  Using this scheme in the M9 military computer together with the SCR584 radar system yielded 90% accuracy of anti-aircraft fire.  For the first time this system was used in 1944 during the <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2592%25D1%258B%25D1%2581%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0_%25D0%25B2_%25D0%2598%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B8">landing of Allied forces in Italy</a> . <br><br><br>  <b>1947</b> At the Columbia University in New York, the term <b><i>operational amplifier</i></b> (OU) was developed during research to improve analog computing for military purposes.  Design OU was designed by Loebe Julie Loeb.  This scheme had two major innovations.  Funds have been applied to reduce the zero drift of the amplifier and, more importantly, it was the first design of the operational amplifier, which will have two inputs (one inverting, the other non-inverting). <br><br>  <b>1953.</b> In 1946, after being discharged from the army, George A. Philbrick established a company named after himself, <b><i>George A. Philbrick Researches, Inc., (GAP / R)</i></b> and became involved in the creation of operational amplifiers.  His work played an important role in the development of the OS. <br><br>  Soon, in <b>January 1953</b> , the first commercial OU <b>K2-W</b> was released.  However, its cost was about $ 20.  K2-W used two double 12AX7 triodes and was packaged in a standard eight-pin connector.  OU was built on the design of Loeb Julie.  Operating at a voltage of ¬± 300V, the op-amp could operate at output and input voltages up to ¬± 50V and had a gain of more than 15,000. <br>  If the reader will have to create diagrams on this OS, then he can follow the links on <a href="">page 1</a> , <a href="">page 2</a> .  For the rest, I'll just bring figure 4. <br><br><br> <a href=""><img height="320" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/be9/378/4d0/be93784d09a3312745a7afc4c1330347.jpg" width="216"></a> <a href=""><img height="320" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/62d/d9c/6d0/62dd9c6d014b589aa8647c76a80e0722.jpg" width="280"></a> <br>  Fig.4.

The op-amp had to deal with signals in the ¬± 10V range. <br>  Later, these voltages became a kind of standard. <br><br> <a href=""><img height="170" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/83c/983/884/83c983884ca16dd7310a59874c840718.jpg" width="200"></a> <a href=""><img height="197" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e50/dc1/240/e50dc124040fe2cbbfe84e68336f4fb4.jpg" width="200"></a> <br>  Fig.  7. OU GAP / R P45.  Photography and electrical schematic diagram. <br><br>  <b>1961.</b> George A. Philbrick creates a <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2592%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BA%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580">varactor</a> bridge operational amplifier circuit. <br>  In this circuit, the voltage of variable capacitors (varactors) is used in the input stage of the operational amplifier.  As a result of the use of a varactor bridge, the lowest input current of any opamp was reached.  Even less than the lamps. <br><br>  Fig.  8 illustrates in the form of a block diagram varactor bridge OU.  There are four main components, the front part consists of a bridge circuit and a high-frequency oscillator circuit, an AC amplifier for amplifying the bridge error voltage, a synchronous phase detector for converting the AC error current for the corresponding DC error, and finally, an output amplifier that provides additional DC amplification and load device. <br><br><br> <a href=""><img height="185" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/667/141/be1/667141be106aefaeaa8e7a5dc7dfdeb1.jpg" width="400"></a> <br>  Fig.  8. A block diagram of a varactor bridge operational amplifier. <br>  The circuit works as follows: a small voltage error of the direct current <b><i>Vin</i></b> is applied to the selected varactor diodes D1 and D2 and causes an imbalance of the ac bridge, which is fed to the ac amplifier.  This AC voltage will be phase shifted depending on the DC error voltage.  The rest of the circuit amplifies and detects a DC error.  Philbrick released the GAP / R P2 operational amplifier.  Released in 1966, a modified op amp GAP / R SP2A could amplify an input current of the order of ¬± 10 pA (10 <sup>‚àí12</sup> ). <br><br><br>  In <b>1965,</b> Ray State Matthew Lorber created <b>Analog Devices, Inc.</b>  <b>(ADI)</b> .  Soon, Lewis R. Smith (Lewis R. Smith) created a varactor amplifier model 301, as well as its successors, models 310 and 311. These projects were able to achieve a significant increase in the accuracy of input currents to ¬± 10fA ( <sup>10-15</sup> ) below GAP / R P2).  Interestingly, 310 and 311 models were sold at prices around $ 75.  These amplifiers are still available in limited quantities. <br><br><br>  <b>1967</b> It is also worth noting that <b>ADI</b> has done a lot to popularize the use of OU.  So, in 1967 she began to publish the magazine <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog_Dialogue">Analog Dialogue Magazine</a></b> , which goes to this day.  The online version of the magazine is a forum for the exchange of solutions in the field of circuit design and software for real devices and signal processing systems.  It discusses technologies and methods for analog, digital and mixed signals.  Working as an ADI technology gateway, <b>Analog Dialogue is</b> published monthly on the Internet.  Selected technical articles are also presented in quarterly <a href="http://rutracker.org/forum/viewtopic.php%3Ft%3D3673933">print publications</a> . <br><br><br>  <b>1962</b> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_R._Pearlman">Alan Perlman</a> and Roger Noble leave <b>GAP / R</b> and create a small company <b>Nexus Research Laboratory, Inc.</b>  They were the first to launch OU packaged in rectangular modules with leads adapted for mounting on printed circuit boards.  This design turned the Shelter into a ‚Äúblack box‚Äù, which was easily viewed as a separate element of the scheme.  Modules have become so popular that GAP / R was forced to release its amplifier in a similar package. <br><br> <a href=""><img height="125" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e69/d71/e43/e69d71e4387df08c70bc70281523709e.jpg" width="200"></a> <a href=""><img height="127" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/728/caa/b75/728caab75e306f48804fd03c403081c2.jpg" width="200"></a> <br>  Fig.  9. OU GAP / R PP65.  Photography and electrical schematic diagram. <br><br>  <b>1963</b> <b>ŒºA702</b> of Fairchild Semiconductor Corporation was the first OU monolithic integrated circuit.  ŒºA702 was developed by a young engineer <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A0%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D1%2582_%25D0%2592%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580">Robert J. (Bob) Vidlar</a> .  The professional activity of Vidlar over the course of just seven years (1963-1970) largely determined the development of analog microelectronics.  But his ŒºA702 definitely did not take the world by storm.  It was not well received, because of unusual properties - excess supply voltage, low gain, etc.  However, despite these shortcomings, some important design trends for IP were established for the ŒºA702. <br><br><br>  <b>1965</b> <b>ŒºA709</b> released.  It greatly improved the performance of the ŒºA702.  This is a higher gain (45,000 or ~ 94dB), expanded to ¬± 10V input / output voltage, reducing the input current to 200nA and increasing the output current.  The amplifier was powered from a voltage of ¬± 15V.  Frequency compensation was achieved by two RC chains between pins 1-8, and 6-5.  The ŒºA709 quickly became the standard and has been produced for several decades.  Fig.  10 shows a schematic diagram of the ŒºA709. <br><br><br> <a href=""><img height="305" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e3a/259/5ce/e3a2595cee1209ea1719293c4843328e.jpg" width="400"></a> <br>  Fig.  10. Electrical circuit diagram ŒºA709. <br><br>  Despite the rather strong improvement in the circuit compared to the ŒºA702, the amplifier still had problems. <br><br><br>  <b>1967.</b> Not wanting to rest on the laurels of his OS ŒºA702 and ŒºA709, Bob Vidlar switched to another company, National Semiconductor Corporation (NSC).  Its next integrated circuit design, the <b>LM101</b> , was launched in 1967.  The LM101 used a simple two-step topology that solved the ŒºA709 problems.  In addition, it was the design of operational amplifiers, which was subsequently followed by many manufacturers.  A simplified diagram of the LM101 is shown in Figure 11. <br> <a href=""><img height="285" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b5f/c8c/f97/b5fc8cf97ed59c66a37a0b23ee5b3db2.jpg" width="400"></a> <br><br>  Fig.  11. Simplified diagram of the LM101. <br><br>  The goals of the LM101 project were to eliminate such problems as ŒºA709: <br>  ‚Ä¢ No short circuit protection. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Integrated frequency compensation. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Sensitivity to overvoltage differential input. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Excessive power dissipation and limited power range. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Sensitivity to capacitive loads. <br><br>  The new design of the LM101 solved the problems of the ŒºA709, and added a few more improvements.  Gain increased to 160,000 (~ 104 dB), useful power range increased from ¬± 5V to ¬± 20V.  For easy upgrades, the LM101 used the same pins as the ŒºA709 for input, output, and power. <br><br><br>  <b>1968</b> Less than a year after the release of the LM101, Fairchild in 1968 released the OA <b>ŒºA741</b> , designed by Dave Fallager.  A simplified diagram of the <b>ŒºA741</b> is presented in Figure 12. <br><br><br> <a href=""><img height="298" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/078/5e1/660/0785e16601895b2cfd862c356c0422d9.jpg" width="400"></a> <br>  Fig.  12. Simplified scheme ŒºA741. <br><br>  Although there are obvious differences in the circuits, in ŒºA741 the signal path is equivalent to LM101, and it provides similar behavior in terms of input short circuit and overvoltage protection, and has comparable bandwidth.  A distinctive feature of the ŒºA741 was the presence of a 30pF capacitor compensation in the chip, it soon became the standard. <br><br>  The LM101, with the user-added capacitor, was functionally equivalent to the ŒºA741.  However, ease of use has proven to be more valuable to users than flexibility.  National Semiconductor subsequently made a hybrid packet of an LM101 chip and a 30pF capacitor, but it was the ŒºA741 that became the standard. <br><br>  In Wikipedia this <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2592%25D0%25BD%25D1%2583%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BD%25D1%258F%25D1%258F_%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D1%2583%25D0%25BA%25D1%2582%25D1%2583%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0_%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BE_%25D1%2583%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D1%258F_741">article is</a> devoted to this amplifier. <br><br><br>  <b>1970</b> John AD Cadigan creates a high-speed operational amplifier.  The distinctive ability of this opamp was the use of field-effect transistors in the input stage.  OU was designed as a hybrid integrated circuit.
