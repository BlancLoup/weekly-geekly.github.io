  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What they pay big money for</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In any job, and especially in the IT field, companies love to organize for employees chasing ghostly goals with possible encouragement if they are achieved.  I think many people have heard the phrase ‚ÄúDo more, get more!‚Äù Or ‚ÄúDo faster, get a bonus, slower get a penalty!‚Äù.  And each of us, who was losing his strength and cramming an elephant into the eye of a needle (I am talking about deadlines), attended the thought ‚ÄúIs this the only way to get the money that they promise me?‚Äù.  And the answer is obvious - of course, not the only one.  And I am talking about salary - it is clear that if a person has his own business, his salary is often determined by the income of this business, but the question is how realistic is to become a professional hired employee with a big salary and what needs to be done to do this. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  In my opinion, the reasons why they can pay a really big salary, two are responsibility and qualification.  It sounds somewhat abstract, so I will explain. <br><br><h4>  A responsibility </h4><br>  If the work of any system is critical for a business, then the person responsible for the smooth operation of this system, taking responsibility for its work, should receive more.  At the same time, it is quite possible that in the event of any failure (even at 3 o'clock in the morning) - it is not necessary, but possible, - he will have to break loose and go to deal with the problem.  But the authorities know for sure - they have a guarantee, the person who is responsible for this.  And, as you can see, there is no need to do any more for this.

    <h4>  Qualification </h4><br>  I think that we all understand that not one hundred projects were ruined by the armlessness of the people working there - where something is not connected there, but nobody knows how, it‚Äôs crooked and everything goes in an explorer, the code is not object-oriented and making changes there is hellishly difficult.  And there must be a person who does this neatly, correctly, scalable.  Otherwise, in the end, nothing will work.  For example, many companies have employees who are optimizing work and increasing system performance.  Giving him some deadlines is stupid - ‚ÄúIn 2 weeks you have to increase productivity by one and a half times, otherwise we will fire you!‚Äù.  Most likely, such people receive awards in the case of particularly serious achievements, but otherwise they are given to work quietly.  Well and, quite possibly, they share their qualifications with other employees - for example, they help to write more optimized code under load right away.  And as you can see, there is no need to do more either. <br><br>  But often this separation is somewhat contrived - often these two reasons go hand in hand.  The biggest money is paid to someone who says, "I know how to."  I know how to make the project attendance grow 10 times.  I know how to increase profits.  I know how to grab a big chunk of the market.  Such people are given enough resources - money, labor, because managers know that all this will pay off with interest.  That the high cost of such an employee will lead to even greater profits.  And it is such people in the business environment, in any field, worth its weight in gold. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/89966/">https://habr.com/ru/post/89966/</a></p>
