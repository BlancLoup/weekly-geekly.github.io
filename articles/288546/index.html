And this planet is more and more wonderful.  And the people on it never cease to amaze each other with various forms of hatred and envy.

      Something happened, and last week there were aggravations on the gender front.  Each of the warring parties was marked by provocative messages and gunfights.  Actually, this conflict, Men vs.  Women, already rather fed up with everything.  However, no one gives up, although it is constantly stated otherwise.  Immediately, I note that I am for men, although the feminins like them more.  So, at first a <a href="http://naher-eto-vse.livejournal.com/12720.html">manifesto</a> appeared <a href="http://naher-eto-vse.livejournal.com/12720.html">in support of normal men</a> .  " <em>I am opposed, gentlemen! Against what the peasants have turned into now. Against the state of affairs that has developed around. And now there is a total humiliation of such a biological species as a man. For what is now, can, except for genocide, name A normal heterosexual man is the most powerless creature in our society. The women have become brutalized so much that they can all be driven away to some barge and flooded somewhere in the Mariana Trench</em> .  This manifesto was tested in my second half, which, before reading it to the end, stated that it was written by a loser, offended by life and women, and that such people should be beaten.  As I understand it, I better keep my mouth shut.  It is better to be a henpecked, than dead or simply crippled.  It took about one and a half days, as the previous post was written no less <a href="http://katechkina.livejournal.com/254847.html">monumental answer</a> .  " <em>This is the most masculine" must "appear not from scratch, but from the very time when the feather-down relationship" boy-girl "develops into a reinforced concrete" family ". And notice, this is not a" man must, "but" we there were obligations, "because we made the same" conscious choice. "Moreover, every day you will have more and more. Just like me. Family is not only a spiritual unity</em> ."  Now bloggers can‚Äôt be stopped: a sore subject has been found, everyone should flaunt their thoughts on this.  But then under the distribution fall exclusively men.  First, we are urged to burn the hot iron out of our vocabulary with the question: ‚Äú <a href="http://den-hunter.livejournal.com/186640.html">Honey, and what do we have for dinner?</a> ‚Äù And replace it with: ‚ÄúHoney, will you eat dinner?‚Äù Moreover, it is proposed to check the normality of these two phrases.  Guess which of these two questions should a normal guy ask?  Secondly, our brains are hovering <a href="http://milimani.livejournal.com/264249.html">about proper courtship</a> .  Moreover, this proper courtship, it turns out, depends only on the flowers, which I, you, we will give to our objects of sigh!  Color blind to read strictly contraindicated - upset.  " <em>Red flowers are given either on the anniversary of a middle-aged woman, or actress-singers, or a mistress. White flowers are for a funeral or a bride (yes, I also like alternatives, but that's the way it is)</em> ."  And so on.  There are generally many points that a real man must follow.  Thirdly, if you have not yet become sick of being a real man, in particular, and just a man in general, <a href="http://spinysun.livejournal.com/25062.html">you will be trained</a> to understand and appreciate the fragility of girls.  "The <em>girl really wants to be understood, even if she speaks a mixture of Martian and Nizhny Novgorod. Even if the nebula of her phrases could envy London</em> ."  It seems to me that the one who already asks only: ‚ÄúHoney, will you have dinner?‚Äù - while giving the correct amount of tulips of the right color, he will appreciate a phrase like: ‚ÄúIt seems to me that you do not love me!‚Äù. <br><br>  <strong>‚ÄúFor Belarus!‚Äù Of the week</strong> <br><br>  The fact that Belarusians like to vote is known for a long time.  This week, they, that is, ours, have another reason to show this natural passion to the fullest.  Naturally, like everything else on the Internet, in the end this idea turned into a grotesque parody of real life.  He organized one famous LiveJournal user a prize of his own name and promised the winner in each nomination for a thousand evergreens.  At first candidates were nominated by everyone, then lists for voting were formed.  Almost Oscar, only such shtetl and with constant bickering between the applicants.  And somehow it happened by chance that one of the applicants in the nomination " <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/rykov_premia/10979.html">Writer of the Year in LiveJournal</a> " was our compatriot <a href="http://vinah.livejournal.com/">Vinah</a> .  That's where the fun began.  And I‚Äôm just ashamed of the behavior of some compatriots.  For example, some people for some reason <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/by/548697.html">decided to recall the</a> battle of 492 years ago.  And the slogan for voting is coined idiotic to the impossibility: ‚Äú <em>For the Belarusian people for the people, the rights for the rights of the people</em> ‚Äù.  AAA!  Just not my brain!  As was correctly noted in one of the comments on this post: where is my foil cap?  In theory, this post alone was enough for my brain to flow out through my ears, but almost immediately I came across the <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/fofudja/479311.html">next miracle</a> .  Of course, I understand that all this is such a strange humor and banter, but I already want to have a big round stamp ‚ÄúKG / AM‚Äù for myself, catch some ‚Äúauthors‚Äù and tick it on their forehead like a stigma.  According to Hydrometeorological Center reports, the level of degeneration throughout the country does not exceed the natural background.  In this whole story, as an island of common sense, I am pleased with the behavior of Vinah herself, who in general does not comment on this at all, but calmly looks at the local Eurovision.  We wish all of us peace of mind next year! <br><br>  <strong>Dead weeks</strong> <br><br>  I‚Äôm curious about death rather than fear.  No, of course, I am afraid to die myself, and I worry about my relatives and close ones, but death itself is interesting to me.  Probably for this reason I was interested in the <a href="http://antimil.livejournal.com/70418.html">diaries of the dead people</a> .  Once upon a time I wrote about this post a long time ago, but since then the list has been updated and added.  I‚Äôd better quote: " <em>They say a person lives while memory lives on it. Memory can live forever on the Internet. A person is long gone, but messages from him continue to live on forums, they can be answered. Only the author himself will not answer. Where I a year ago I first encountered the dead man‚Äôs diary. I was looking for some information on the anime and went to the site by the people. The girl wrote, naively, so naively that I became interested and began to read, and in the process of reading I suddenly realized that this girl no longer in the world of the living, that I read the letters of a dead man</em>  <em>Perelez in the guest and was convinced of his assumption - the site is not updated. But the guest lives</em> . " <br><br>  To dispel the impression of the previous paragraph, another story about the dead.  Despite the fact that the man died, the story, however, is very funny and positive.  Moreover, the orthodox father tells her, and she happened to him in the mid-80s.  The story <a href="http://shpol.livejournal.com/49543.html">of the dead man in the obkom</a> . <br><br>  <strong>Excitement of the week</strong> <br><br>  And this is what I worry about for future generations.  Well, young, it seems, but I feel that the comrades following me will be different.  And, of course, worse!  Well, you know, because in our time, the trees were taller, and the grass is greener, and the ice cream tastes better, and the girls are warmer.  Quote: " <em>No one knows what the school history course turns into in children's heads. Fragments of facts, dates, strange names like Tokhtomysh and Methodius are mixed with the flow of information from the TV, books and computer games and sometimes turn into a real alternative history</em> ."  <a href="http://radulova.livejournal.com/451331.html">An alternative story is here</a> . <br><br>  And on this issue of the most evil review of blogs, I think is complete.  Catholics, with the coming! <br><br>  <strong>Standard-bearer Kh.A.</strong> <br><br>  <a href="http://kv.by/index2006510601.htm">Published in "Computer News" (# 51, 2006)</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/288546/">https://habr.com/ru/post/288546/</a></p>
