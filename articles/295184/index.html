And despite the fact that all these tasks are very important and often have to be completed within a specific time frame, we often forget about our duties, and our wardrobe is limited to underwear, and our days are filled with video games and watching all seasons of The Walking Dead "(Oh, not life, but a dream). <br><br>  There are many habits and rituals that can help shape a fruitful day.  But there are also a lot of little things that will help you create an atmosphere conducive to prosperity.

      Here are some of the little things that contribute to more productive homework: <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Open the curtains and open the windows </h4><br>  Work in a well-lit room (especially with natural light) is good uplifting.  Fresh air is another big plus.  This is incomparable with a walk in the fresh air, but still much better than the stale air in your house (no offense).  Fresh air helps our body get more oxygen, gives us extra energy and clears the mind. <br><br>  With regard to natural light, it gives us a feeling of cheerfulness, which in these conditions is stronger than with artificial or dimmed light.  In addition, in the sunlight, we feel relaxed, which has a beneficial effect on our endurance.  And it helps to reduce blood pressure and levels of cortisol, a stress hormone. <br><br><h4>  Listen to music </h4><br>  It is well known that music can give you a good charge of energy for training or cleaning, as well as create a pleasant background while studying or working without distracting you from basic activities.  Listening to musical compositions at a medium level of loudness develops creative abilities due to the processes occurring in the human brain, if you listen carefully.  Listening to classical music in children and stroke victims improves visual attention. <br><br>  According to studies, music during workouts motivates us to work faster and more efficiently, we use less oxygen with the same performance efficiency as without music.  (By the way, 8tracks is a great service for searching for new songs, performers and pre-prepared playlists suitable for each mood. You can also create your own music collections in it) <br><br><h4>  Light scented candles or use incense. </h4><br>  It has been proven that certain odors reduce blood pressure and stress levels, increase clarity of mind, allow you to concentrate and raise your mood.  In both the United States and Japan, companies use various incenses to increase employee productivity, which contribute to concentration, relaxation, and susceptibility and create a general tonic effect. <br><br>  These are the flavors of apple, lemon, rose, cypress, mint, lavender, jasmine, rosemary and cinnamon.  In fact, any smell you like can create a more comfortable atmosphere, which in turn favors good mood and productive work.  So if you can't stand mint, but you love the orange flavor, then use it for health ‚Äî even if there is no science-proven benefit. <br><br><h4>  Do not forget about the correct posture, comfortable pillows and appropriate clothing </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/917/95a/a61/91795aa61d05493491d2bda38620e45d.jpg"><br><br>  <i>"A small laptop is best used when lying in bed, putting it on your hips and bending your knees."</i>  <i>- according to the research of Dave Malouf</i> <br><br>  If you exercise at home, get a good yoga mat.  If you do the cleaning, wear something comfortable, not constraining movements and not interfering with your work (the same with the workout outfit).  If you undertake to study or work, then make your workplace comfortable.  You can sit at the table, wrap yourself in blankets on the bed, or sit on the floor among the pillows.  If you expect that you will be uncomfortable while working on the next project (I personally hate to sit at the table), then you are unlikely to take up at all.  When you are going to work, make sure that your posture does not create excessive tension in any part of your body, especially in the back and neck.  If, due to an incorrect posture, when you work, you get sick of something, then you will get distracted every now and then, even without noticing it at first.  As a last resort, at least try to change positions more often to reduce tension in certain areas of your body. <br><br><h4>  Change the scenery - work in another room </h4><br>  Try to bring your laptop, training materials or dumbbells for training in a new place.  People have a difficult relationship with the routine: it seems that we love and hate it at the same time.  Despite the fact that we are so easily accustomed to the routine, sometimes daily monotony complicates life.  Such small changes in everyday life as yoga in the living room, not the bedroom, can give us the strength to move on.  It seems that this is too little to feel a noticeable impact, but in fact it gives a good effect (at least, this is relevant to me). <br><br><h4>  Maintain optimum temperature </h4><br>  Indoor temperature has a huge impact on our productivity.  If you are cold (or hot), then it‚Äôs not just uncomfortable, it distracts - just as the body‚Äôs uncomfortable position during work, which we talked about earlier.  Your brain will not concentrate properly on your work if it is too busy solving temperature control problems.  In accordance with these studies, low office temperature contributes to a decrease in work productivity.  The optimum temperature in the room, contributing to concentrated work, equal to 25 degrees Celsius.  Again, if you exercise or with excitement you clean the apartment, then perhaps a cooler room will suit you and your activity.  In any case, if you feel uncomfortable, think about changing the temperature in the room. <br><br>  I hope these tips are helpful to you!  If you know any other quick and easy ways to create an atmosphere conducive to constructive activities, then feel free to share them in the comments. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/295184/">https://habr.com/ru/post/295184/</a></p>
