  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Sony Xperia Z5 Compact - after 8 months</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The longer you use your smartphone, the better you will know its small advantages and disadvantages.  We did the Sony Xperia Z5 Compact test in the video format that year, but now the sixth Android flew onto the device, and the whole story happened to the Z5 Compact, so there was a desire to dot the whole thing, to make a fuller review of it and make the final verdict on the pros and cons.  This time without video, only here, on giktaims. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/39f/a9d/c7b/39fa9dc7b4f14e9c8e4e9f5da89877a3.jpg"><br><br>  Sony Xperia Z5 Compact is the last mini-flagship of Sony in the Z line, we recall that now the flagships of the Japanese company are marked with X - X, X Performance, XA Ultra, and then probably will be X2, X3, X4 and X5.  Was the Z line successful?  Perhaps, yes, but, the fifth series of Z-devices cannot be called uniquely successful.  Some critics were not satisfied with the price, others did not like the design and construction.  At the same time, it is impossible to deny that the fifth Z series brought a number of improvements, almost all of which are embodied in the Z5 Compact. <a name="habracut"></a>

      The device itself is small, snatchy, light, thin.  In terms of its dimensions, the smartphone corresponds to the first compact, it is half a millimeter thinner and one gram heavier, but its screen is not 4.3 ", but already 4.6".  This can not but cause approval.  The resolution did not change, 1280 by 720 points. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f7a/6ab/f5a/f7a6abf5a90349d8bd6fe539d52e9e20.jpg"><br><br>  The body is monolithic.  The outer frame is plastic, and the metal plate behind the screen, on which the entire electronic filling rests, is very thin.  When falling, a significant part of the impact energy goes to the screen module.  If the blow is strong enough, the screen cracks and the touch layer completely fails, well, and you have an expensive trip to the service.  We dropped the Z1 Compact and many other flagship smartphones many times, some drops were much harder, and the blows were stronger, but we haven‚Äôt yet managed to beat any flagships.  The only exception is the Z5 Compact, which fell out of the pocket of the jacket onto the asphalt, covered with winter slush.  The first kiss with the ground and the screen was covered with a pattern of destruction.  Yes, it was a shame.  And, a few days before the fall, we were looking for protective films, glasses or covers in Moscow - there was nothing on sale for the new smartphone yet, and the smartphone is slippery and falls out of the hands easily.  It was necessary to take the cover on the Internet, and this, by the way, is valuable advice for all who aimed at this smartphone. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e9b/aec/9d0/e9baec9d072949bd9119c3ef87baf7be.jpg"><br>  <i>It was a shame!</i> <br><br>  Z5 Compact is glued to ensure dust and moisture protection and is disassembled exclusively using a hair dryer and a set of suction cups and special tools.  For reassembly, it is recommended to get a set of plastic clips, good glue and a 2 mm adhesive tape for degreasing.  You will lose some of the moisture protection in any case and, in general, it is better not to disassemble the Z5 ever, if it does not break, and rebuild the master with experienced hands, even if you have some experience in repairing iPhones / guglofonov.  Firstly, a normal master will not damage the trains, and if it does, he will be guilty.  Secondly, the master guesses that if the proximity sensor is not tight to the screen, then the next day you will bring a smartphone to him: ‚Äúuh, master dear, I start the call, my screen turns black and I can‚Äôt do anything until the conversation will not end, come on. ‚Äù- programmatically, without root, by the way, it is not treated, you have to go through the smartphone again and properly press the sensor to the screen.  This is not the only trifle to which attention should be paid when assembling and disassembling, there are many of these, so we do not recommend going through the Z5 on our own, and the master can get tidier and tidier with greater preservation of moisture protection.  We are serious.  The installation price of the screen module is usually one thousand rubles.  But, if there are no normal masters in your city, you can go through yourself - the main thing is to carefully study the manuals, of which there are many text formats and video formats.  In the markets, the screen module for the Z5 Compact costs up to 10,000 rubles (at a smartphone cost from 25,000 rubles), on the Internet the price is just over 3,000 rubles.  We found the cheapest option, in the description of which for some reason it was stated that it was for the Z5 Mini and FullHD, although there is no such phone, and it has the usual resolution - 720p, ordered and installed it.  At the same time ordered a protective glass and cover (with the name "Transparent Dirt-Resistant Plastic Hard Case Cover For Sony Xperia Z5 Compact", if you are interested).  The brightness of the Chinese module is slightly lower, otherwise the visual and sensations are practically the same as the original. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/Shal7U3VklY%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700023,15700043,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgyYcrKJbcPxciV_7MKgu0iVsnPAA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <i>That same video</i> <br><br>  More about dust and moisture protection.  On the old Z-smartphones Xperia, it was also, but all the ports and slots were closed with plugs.  On the Z5, Z5 Premium and Z5 Compact Micro-USB slot of a new standard, it is not afraid of moisture (if you do not charge it under water), but this is not a Type-C.  Hence the lack of a plug on the Micro-USB port for charging while maintaining water resistance.  It‚Äôs the same with the minijack, but the minijack was not afraid of water before.  A single plug protects the slots for the memory card and the Nano-SIM.  Simka, as before, is inserted using an uncomfortable adapter.  Spray gadget is not afraid, and is able to easily survive a short immersion in fresh water - provided that the cap is securely closed.  Z1 Compact we quietly drowned in hot tea without consequences, but this one would not risk.  Especially after rebuilding. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8c1/de7/6e0/8c1de76e050049e4865895354ea763e5.jpg"><br>  <i>With Android 6.0, this thing finally pleases</i> <br><br>  Another difference from the old Z, noticeable to the naked eye - the protruding power button is replaced by a fingerprint scanner.  It works quickly and in our opinion this is one of the main advantages of the new compact for those who care about protecting their data, but have been tortured to constantly enter passwords.  We put the finger and the gadget is unlocked.  On the old firmware in this method, hell and a dirty trick lay - if you put the wrong finger several times, the gadget was blocked and required to enter a password.  Why this is done is completely incomprehensible, you can‚Äôt grow new fingers with other fingerprints?  The only assumption is that you know that someone‚Äôs smartphone was trying to unlock.  On the sixth Android, everything has become face to the user, there is a lock too, but it is temporary, for a minute, and even if your friend decided to shock your Z5, which he took without asking, you will not have to enter your long password when the smartphone returns to your hands . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d6b/224/44e/d6b22444ecd24f8085c17d2082bc8e44.jpg"><br>  <i>Lifelog hints that it's time for a walk</i> <br><br>  Android 6.0.1 flew to the device immediately after the repair.  The first thing that caught my eye, or rather, in the ears, the smartphone stopped twanging fifty times, if fifty notifications came to you.  Scribbled just to be.  It works stably, without departures.  The shell branded today is no worse and no better than bare Android, but this is the shell, and in addition to it, the Z5 has a set of proprietary software preinstalled, including those worthy of the Music (Walkman) program and Lifelog, a fitness tracker from Sony.  Lifelog does not need any bracelets, although it can work with them "to increase accuracy", the software collects daily activity data quite accurately, knows how poorly to distinguish a bicycle from a run, and allows you to save statistics and draw conclusions, isn't it time? then change in life.  The second software is the Walkman player (aka Music) with the only significant drawback, it catches not only music in the Music daddies on the internal memory (32 GB) and MicroSD, but all the music from all daddies where there is no .nomedia file, which means Your playlist will also get ringtones from the Google Talk messenger directory (aka Hangouts).  And nothing can be done about it - there are no settings with the choice of folders with music.  But with a Walkman smartphone sounds like a good hardware player (with the same JetAudio this was not), Z5 Compact is one of the best musical instruments of smartphones.  The device perfectly reveals the sound of the reinforcement headset Creative Aurvana In-Ear 3 Plus, which we have been using for quite some time and suggests the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãselling the stale FiiO X3.  Speaker volume on the z5 compact is higher than on the z1 compact.  In general, for the work on sound Sony engineers want to put down green tea (or whatever it is now customary to put down to decent engineers in Japan). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3ff/abf/e9c/3ffabfe9c4e54b44967ca57ba953edca.jpg"><br>  <i>Walkman player, also called Music, is the best Android player in our humble opinion</i> <br><br>  The quality of communication is impeccable, you can hear the interlocutor perfectly, he, too.  Z5 holds the signal confidently, specially compared with the Lenovo Vibe X2, and in those areas where Vibe has already lost the network, the Z5 Compact still catches something.  There is support for LTE and Bluetooth 4.1.  There is GPS, but Glonass and Beidou can be, and can be locked up. <br><br>  The eight-core Snapdragon 810, in conjunction with the Adreno 530 graphics and non-record 2 GB of memory by today's standards, demonstrates excellent performance on a 720p screen.  Responsiveness of the interface, the speed of switching between applications, the quality of the software work is impeccable.  As for games, of course, everything goes, at WoT Blitz at maximum speeds the average FPS is about 50. Yes, now there are more nimble chipsets, but with such a screen resolution, he doesn‚Äôt physically need more and will not be needed for a long time.  But the fact that the memory is only two gigabytes is, of course, in vain.  In single-task mode, they are enough, but maps and other applications hanging in the background will be unloaded almost immediately, as you roll them up, and the destination address will have to be reset.  Also, the smartphone quickly heats up under load, but here it is impossible to say unequivocally whose jamb is the Sony or Qualcomm engineers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0dc/927/43a/0dc92743a88f4da3b79c3863ca8e2195.jpg"><br>  <i>If you use the Z5c for Pockemon Go, you can not do without an external battery</i> <br><br>  The battery capacity is 2700 mAh (400 mAh more than in the Z1 Compact).  Enough for one full day in normal mode and a little more remains when you put the phone on charge in the evening, but no more.  If you use the Z5 Compact purely as a dialer, of course, enough for more time.  Well, if you are a Pokemon Go lover, the game discharges the battery completely with a mobile connection and GPS in two and a half hours.  World of Tanks Blitz with WiFI - four hours.  A YouTube video with a WiFi connection can be watched for more than 8 hours.  In Antutu Tester Battery Test with the fifth Android, the smartphone scored 6691 points, and on the sixth Android it is too lazy to rework a long test (someone wondering how many points the smart is gaining in this test?).  But it was not too lazy to get rid of Antutu Benchmark 6.1.4 - the smartphone scored 67874 points. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/89d/b6d/a80/89db6da80bf84bee81d70af3d8455337.JPG"><br>  An example of a picture with the Z5 Compact, more photos <a href="https://fotki.yandex.ru/users/treehel/album/490270">here</a> (there you can watch full-size) <br><br>  Photos from the Z5 Compact are excellent, by the standards of mobile phones.  This is probably the best soap dish with such dimensions, but the final images suffer from barrel distortions in thirds.  The focal length of the optics is 35mm equivalent - 24mm at f / 2.0.  Sensor 23 megapixels, 1 / 2.3 ". We recommend shooting in 8 megapixels mode, if you do not collect then process and sprinkle landscapes. And do not be afraid to" zoom in "a little, if necessary - actually trimming the whole image from 23 megapixels to the selected area will work We also tried to install Lightroom to see if the Z5 Compact can shoot in RAW - no, it doesn‚Äôt, people even collected a petition on the Sony website to add RAW, so far to no avail.But 4K-video of the Z5 Compact can write, sorry stub. FullHD writes with software stabilization. Front camera 5 megapixels. Not bad. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/160/e49/c1a/160e49c1a4624c2cbc80e42fa624cfcf.jpg"><br>  <i>Previously, there would be Carl, and now the letter G, by analogy with cool G-lenses for the Sony E / FE system</i> <br><br>  Well, now it's time for conclusions (or sentence) - the Z5 Compact is never an ideal smartphone;  in order to be massive, it is expensive, it has only one SIM card slot, 2 GB of RAM (greedy), a ‚Äúno wow‚Äù screen and fragility, which is partially solved by a good cover and protective glass.  Judging by the reviews on the web, some users also have a battery swell, but this is hardly a mass phenomenon and it has bypassed us, but, the loudest, it happens that those who have the most unfortunate alignment cry.  On the other hand, what can you take if not the Z5 Compact?  The device is small, catchy, many people like it (including the author), at the same time, the screen is 4.6 ‚Äùis not a sentence, you can play with it, and sit on social networks, and surf the Internet.  If we search on the market, then, among similar things, we are pushing into completely new models like Xperia Z1 and Z3 Compact, YotaPhone, Lumia 1020, Highscreen ICE 2 and Micromax Q450 Canvas Sliver 5, well, and a four-inch iPhone 5S, and each one has So let the Z5 Compact concede, but the screen has a smaller screen, and is larger in size.  For 25 thousand rubles, the Z5 Compact is probably the only modern decent-looking smartphone from a normal brand (this is about the smartphone, as image-building things) with a nimble iron and a fresh Android, dust and moisture protection, a good camera and great sound, and regular updates of the software, battery for a full day, a fingerprint scanner and the lack of stability problems or localization curves or unexpected surprises that we have recently increasingly encountered in Chinese smartphones (those with the most attractive prices).  and characteristics).  Therefore, we have fixed the Z5 Compact to change it for no reason.  The main thing is not to crash again :-) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/396163/">https://habr.com/ru/post/396163/</a></p>
