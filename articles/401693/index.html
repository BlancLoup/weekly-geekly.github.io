      <b>Kerim:</b> Things are going well.  We were a little out of schedule - our contractors had a slight delay.  But in general, everything goes according to plan.  Now we are planning a presentation at the end of February.  By this time, everything will be ready. <br><br>  Those experts who will go to the Integrated Systems Europe exhibition in Amsterdam will be able to see the new speakers [it was they who used to create the Audio-cinema theater hall] already at the Ceratec stand. <br><br>  <b>Alina:</b> Theater columns? <br><br>  <b>Kerim:</b> Ceratec cinema lineup. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2b6/719/aab/2b6719aab1e641b7a7fc54b44842dc27.jpg" width="500"></div><br>  <i><font color="#A9A9A9">/ <a href="http://www.audiomania.ru/vstraivaemaya_akustika/ceratec/ceratec_cerasonar_1520_x1.html">Built-in acoustics Ceratec Cerasonar 1520 X1</a></font></i> <br><br>  <b>Alina:</b> Are these so-called ‚Äúinvisible columns‚Äù and ‚Äúvisible‚Äù? <br><br>  <b>Kerim:</b> At Ceratec, the model will now be glad to consist of three large parts.  The first is what they started with, the design columns in aluminum cases.  The second part - the invisible stealth columns, which are mounted in plasterboard structures under the plaster. <br><br>  The third group includes speakers for personal cinema halls, home theaters, for concealed installation, but not into the wall, like a Cerasonar line, but behind an acoustically transparent screen, behind an acoustically transparent decorative wall.  For this we decided to make our cinema. <br><br>  <b>Alina:</b> And at the end of February there will be a presentation only for some special guests?  Or will simple buyers also be able to come and watch a movie? <br><br>  <b>Kerim:</b> We will not invite buyers to this presentation yet.  Projects of cinema halls for which Ceratec acoustics is intended for non-specialists will be hard to implement entirely.  Therefore, first of all, the presentation will be aimed at installers - market professionals, who, I hope, will appreciate these speakers. <br><br>  <b>Alina:</b> If a person is interested in technology, likes to understand everything, he is generally able to master this topic on his own? <br><br>  <b>Kerim:</b> Of course.  If a person has time and interest, and he feels the strength, of course, he will be able to realize the cinema hall on his own.  The question of time and effort. <br><br>  A large number of resources can help here - mostly American ones.  There are many self-build enthusiasts.  People make quite large cinema halls themselves, that's why you can find useful tips.  Many pictures, video, text. <br><br> <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/audiomania/blog/284694/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4e3/501/65c/4e350165cc204561a553234f9a895849.jpg"></a> <br>  <i><font color="#A9A9A9">/ <a href="http://vigorousspace.co/zvoook/00039">Release of the podcast on the construction of cinema halls</a></font></i> <br><br>  <b>Alina:</b> If we are not talking about an enthusiast who does everything himself, he is filling up bumps in parallel, but about the classical scheme, when a person comes to the installers and says that he wants to make a home theater from the basement in the house, how long does it take to create such a movie theater? <br><br>  <b>Kerim:</b> It all depends on the size of the room.  The larger the room, the more constructions in it, the longer it will create.  Further, it all depends on some special solutions, design delights. <br><br>  The designer, who is the author of the project, has a plan.  He believes that everything in the cinema should be implemented that way.  A company that makes a cinema hall project should take all these interests into account. <br><br>  It all depends on the time of coordination.  It is not certain how long it can take.  It can take two months to create such a room as ours.  This is in view of the design, manufacture of structures, the acoustic shell itself, and installation. <br><br>  And then, usually the installers rent everything on a turnkey basis.  It may be that the room is designed, and the equipment is delayed.  This is a complete solution.  Therefore, the issue with the cinema is always tied to the issue of general repair. <br><br>  It rarely happens that the renovation of the house is completed, but there remains an unfinished room in which they decided to make a cinema hall.  Usually all this is created in a complex.  The house is being built, or it is being renovated, and at the same time work is underway on a personal cinema hall. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Pd3cS8R1-2k" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <b>Dmitry:</b> How is the cinema supposed to be used from the point of view of demonstration of the material to the audience?  How will it work?  Record preliminary? <br><br>  <b>Kerim:</b> We most likely have in Audiomania.  By prior agreement, of course, you can come and see.  Since we are a store that is constantly open during business hours, someone may have a momentary desire to come and see. <br><br>  We will always have employees who can hold a demonstration.  But it must be borne in mind that at this moment there may be a demonstration for someone else.  So if you spontaneously end up there, you can either wait or join an ongoing demonstration.  This may not always be complete, because there are people who evaluate the sound of the cinema on different fragments. <br><br>  <b>Dmitry:</b> It‚Äôs difficult [to evaluate everything] here, it seems to me, also because you need the right content. <br><br>  <b>Kerim:</b> Yes.  If a person has some favorite Blu-ray disc, he can bring it with him.  But we will have a fairly wide range of discs with different types of films. <br><br>  These will be both action movies and view films, which are shot with very high quality.  It will be possible to evaluate both brightness and color balance.  And we will have musical material. <br><br>  We will have special discs from Dolby that demonstrate the effects of Atmos, we will have discs from Auro to demonstrate the Auro-3D effect.  So there is no point in bringing something with you. <br><br>  <b>Alina:</b> There will always be a consultant in the hall who can tell and explain how things work, how they work technically? <br><br>  <b>Kerim:</b> Yes.  Part of the premises will be the office where I will be, in particular, I and several other employees.  The head of our installation department will be present, though not constantly, because he often goes to the objects.  But he can get more in-depth advice on a comprehensive solution. <br><br>  <b>Alina:</b> It will be possible to look for a specialist "by ear" - by the sounds of [your] voice.  Navigate the podcasts. <br><br>  <b>Kerim:</b> If a movie is played in our room, you can't get past it, the movie will be heard.  Although quite serious work has already been done on sound insulation. <br><br><hr><br>  <b>Dmitry:</b> The second big topic today is <b>gifts</b> .  Small and big holidays are coming.  It is interesting to know what fresh offers are.  It is clear that people have different budgets, different wishes, different interests.  But maybe there is something to tell and see as a whole? <br><br>  Alina three years ago gave me Denon D-600 headphones.  They show themselves great.  Everything works fine.  In addition to classic things like <a href="http://www.audiomania.ru/naushniki/">headphones</a> , can you advise something else? <br><br>  <b>Kerim:</b> We have very qualified consultants.  They will advise everything you need to buy to get the maximum effect.  Naturally, it is better to buy a headphone amplifier for headphones. <br><br>  Audiomania has a very wide range of gifts.  For those who cannot choose, we have a relatively new service - a gift certificate.  You can give a certificate for a certain amount, and the person will get what he needs. <br><br>  The main gifts for February 23 and March 8 are headphones, <a href="http://www.audiomania.ru/portable_hifi/">players</a> , cases for players.  Then we have a relatively recent direction - these are <a href="http://www.audiomania.ru/muzykalnye_intrumenty/">musical instruments</a> : guitars, guitar amplifiers, effects pedals. <br><br>  I would like to draw attention to <a href="http://www.audiomania.ru/portativnyj_rekorder/">portable digital recorders</a> that novice musicians use to make demo recordings.  Now the level of these portable recorders is so high that in CD quality you can record soundtracks, upload them to the Internet. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/aa7/8c0/c88/aa78c0c889d74f7fa69a1de9da79be2d.jpg" width="400"></div><br>  <i><font color="#A9A9A9">/ <a href="http://www.audiomania.ru/portativnyj_rekorder/zoom/zoom_h6.html">Portable Recorder Zoom H6</a></font></i> <br><br>  <b>Dmitry:</b> Is this the Zoom line? <br><br>  <b>Kerim:</b> This is Zoom, Tascam, we have higher level recorders - Marantz. <br><br>  <b>Dmitry:</b> By the way, Zoom, in my opinion, even made your <a href="http://www.audiomania.ru/portativnyj_rekorder/zoom/zoom_q8.html">camcorder</a> ? <br><br>  <b>Kerim:</b> There is a Tascam video recorder.  Well, this is already a serious gift, it costs about 40 thousand rubles.  But you can record your rehearsal on video.  It is always important when you are not just the fact captured, but also in a certain quality, which people can then appreciate. <br><br>  Audiomania is the official dealer of the most famous <a href="http://www.audiomania.ru/gitarnye_komplekty/">guitar</a> brands: Fender, Gibson, Ibanez, Yamaha.  We have a very wide range of cable products and accessories for guitars.  If a person has a guitar, you can always give him a new cable, belt, picks, effects pedal. <br><br>  <b>Dmitry:</b> Is there anything related to vinyl?  Small components or something related to storage? <br><br>  <b>Kerim:</b> Speaking of vinyl, you can not move away from the records. <br><br>  <b>Alina:</b> In fact, a great gift! <br><br>  <b>Kerim:</b> We have a very wide range of records.  Sales of records are growing.  Last year, we significantly increased sales of vinyl, the range is expanding. <br><br>  Accessories for enthusiasts of analog sound, we also have.  These are brushes, anti-static bags, which I recommend every time I talk to you, this is a very useful thing. <br><br>  We will soon have a new direction, we will deal with vintage, rare old records. <br><br>  <b>Dmitry:</b> As far as I know, even now you can write a consultant, and he will help [with rare records]. <br><br>  <b>Kerim:</b> Yes, we can help.  Audiomania is a consulting site.  If we do not have something, or people cannot buy something right now, they will always get advice.  Including vinyl.  If something is not in the catalog of our distributors, we can always ask to know where it can be bought, how to get it. <br><br>  <b>Alina:</b> If we talk about vinyl, it seems to me, it's also cool that since in Audiomania people do not just do music, but listen with enthusiasm to it, you can always get advice not only about components, but also about genres and directions. <br><br>  For example, if a music lover has a collection of music in a certain genre, advise [for a gift] something close to him, which he does not have yet.  We ourselves thought about buying vinyl as a gift.  And they just thought that a person, suppose, has records: ‚Äúone‚Äù, ‚Äútwo‚Äù, ‚Äúthree‚Äù - what else could he be given such a fourth, what does he not have yet? <br><br>  <b>Kerim:</b> You can get such a consultation.  We have a fairly wide <a href="http://www.audiomania.ru/vinilovye_plastinki/">catalog on the site</a> .  You can pick up something by genre.  Of course, giving a record as a gift is good if you know the tastes of a person.  If a person already has the same, it does not matter, the disc can always be changed to something more necessary. <br><br>  By the way, Audiomania is one of the largest stores that sell products for homemade people - the ‚Äú <a href="http://www.audiomania.ru/shop/cat-10.html">Do it yourself</a> ‚Äù section.  Samodelka.ru is a very famous portal with a forum, with a trading platform.  We have a wide range of electronic components, speakers. <br><br>  <b>Dmitry:</b> Is there a gift certificate for these products? <br><br>  <b>Kerim: The</b> certificate is valid, because all these products are home-made on the Audimania website, too. <br><br>  <b>Alina:</b> In order not to give the tenth set of screwdrivers, socks and shaving foam, it is better to give a gift certificate. <br><br>  <b>Kerim:</b> We have everything for do-it-yourselfers: solders, connectors, cables, speakers from leading manufacturers of dynamic heads, which are suppliers of the best brands of speaker systems.  You can buy from us, on the manufacturer's website, take ready-made column projects and make them yourself. <br><br>  Ahead of the event, I can say that Audiomania has prepared for the release of several <b>sets of speaker systems for the assembly</b> , the so-called kit.  It will be possible to buy a separate speaker case, separately - speakers, separately - parts for the assembly of a crossover.  It will be much cheaper than the finished column of the same level.  For a very modest amount, you can get a column of very high quality. <br><br>  <b>Dmitry:</b> How much will the component base be variable? <br><br>  <b>Kerim:</b> We have to wait for the official release.  As far as I know, there will be 4 or 6 different sets. <br><br>  <b>Dmitry:</b> This is an interesting big topic to try to do something on your own and feel the importance of attention to detail. <br><br>  <b>Kerim:</b> We are generally optimistic about this topic.  Follow the news on our website.  It will be written about this, we will give [the project] to the tests and, for certain, it will be somehow interesting to imagine. <br><br>  <b>Dmitry:</b> It seems to me that a cool gift option for those who would not like to give a certificate and not sure of the recipient's tastes will be a <a href="http://www.audiomania.ru/portativniy_pleer/">player</a> .  This is a win-win thing. <br><br>  This is not an attempt to replace a full-fledged home system.  This is a device that a person can fill himself with what he likes more. <br><br>  <b>Kerim:</b> From personal experience and communication experience in the audio environment: a good gift is a <a href="http://www.audiomania.ru/portativnaya_akustika/">wireless speaker</a> .  They enhance the sound library, which is stored in the phone.  With this column, you can go to the country, to nature. <br><br>  There are a lot of manufacturers of such columns, it doesn't even make sense to list them.  I think this is a good gift.  It is universal [and suitable] for the whole family, and not just for the audioman himself. <br><br>  <b>Alina:</b> I gave this to dad. <br><br>  <b>Kerim:</b> I also give myself such columns from time to time. </cut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/401693/">https://habr.com/ru/post/401693/</a></p>
