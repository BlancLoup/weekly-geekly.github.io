These plants are eaten by other people, after which they, who have never taken this medicine, are again found in the urine.

      The subjects were divided into <a href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.est.5b06256">two groups</a> , one of which ate the first week of products grown in fields using treated wastewater, and the second week - products from fields that do not use this water for irrigation.  The second group had a reverse task - although for the second week the test organizers did not have enough food from the fields where the medicine could meet, so the second group ate the food from the supermarket the second week - where the food could meet with traces of the medicine, but most likely it was mixed with food, where these traces are not. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  At first, one-third of all people had too little carbamazepine in their urine for detection, one-third was on the verge of detection, and the last third was within detectable limits.  After the first week, for those who ate food from the fields irrigated with recycled water, the amount of medication in the urine increased - in all it fell within the designated limits, in some it even increased severalfold.  The second group did not change the testimony. <br><br>  In the second week, the first group began to eat food, where there was guaranteed no medicine, and its amount in their urine began to decrease.  The second group ate food from supermarkets, and the amount of medication in their urine did not increase - despite the fact that some products from the store gave a positive result when analyzing for the presence of carbamazepine. <br><br>  This study confirmed the long-standing suspicions that drugs may be involved in such cycles and fall into the organisms of many people, with unexplored effects on their health.  The test was attended by ordinary people - not vegetarians and non-patients who took carbamazepine. <br><br>  Naturally, the content of the substance in the secondary, so to speak, consumers, is orders of magnitude lower than in patients taking the medicine.  However, this is not homeopathy yet - residual doses may well have a negative effect on the organisms of people who are genetically sensitive to the substance, pregnant women, children, and also those who like to eat more plant food. <br><br>  In places with a shortage of fresh water, where water purified after sewage re-enters the fields (California, Israel, Spain), this situation is much more pronounced and dangerous than in other places where there is no shortage of water.  In Israel, where the study was conducted, 50% of the water used for irrigation is taken from treated effluent. <br><br>  Carbamazepine is an antiepileptic drug from the group of carboxamide derivatives.  It is mainly used as an anticonvulsant for large convulsive seizures and for epilepsy.  The mechanism of action of carbamazepine is not fully understood, but in general it has similarities with antiepileptic drugs of the group of hydantoin derivatives.  Included in the list of essential and essential drugs. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/393223/">https://habr.com/ru/post/393223/</a></p>
