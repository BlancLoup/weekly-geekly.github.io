Let's talk about our common Earth.  More precisely, we look at it from space using various automatic and manned vehicles created by our civilization.  And look at the Earth not from a close, circular or geostationary orbit, but from a distance. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/86f/92e/53f/86f92e53fa8cf9c21ae61575290b6cff.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  This frame was received by the European Space Agency's Rosetta satellite.  This unit hit the road in 2003 and should achieve its goal only in 2014.  Such a long road was calculated so that the device could carefully study the nature of comets.  The vehicle flies to the comet 67P / Churyumov-Gerasimenko and during its journey it returned to Earth three times and once flew past Mars. <br><br>  Solar eclipse May 12, 2012 through the eyes of the Moon <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/511/06b/794/51106b794d2077c4854d7afe405a6f53.jpg" alt="image"><br>  More precisely lunar orbital probe Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter.  To obtain frames of the Earth, the satellite has to maneuver difficult.  But such an event as a ring eclipse could not be overlooked. <br><br>  One of the most famous photographs of the twentieth century <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7e7/ebf/604/7e7ebf6046fa61178ae74c9a471abdf5.jpg" alt="image"><br>  It was made manually by the pilot Apollo-17 on December 7, 1972 during the return of the crew after landing on the moon.  The frame was accidental when the position of the ship successfully coincided with the phase of illumination of the Earth.  It is due to the full coverage of the disk, this photo for a long time was the only photographic illustration of the full globe.

      Similar photos have not received such popularity even in Russia <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b66/5d4/062/b665d40621d6145d8f9d9b025304c7ce.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Although it was made by the Soviet Zond-7 automatic station on August 11, 1969.  In fact, it was an apparatus based on the Soyuz spacecraft and its flight to the moon was part of the "lunar race" program.  But the race was lost, therefore, apparently, the results of this work were not particularly spread. <br><br>  The following composition was obtained from the same ‚ÄúProbe-7‚Äù <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ce6/fd0/528/ce6fd05282b70586492a833829a104b2.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The second frame in the series is ‚ÄúPhotoshop‚Äù, which was artificially added to make the series even. <br><br>  Americans also have a similar view. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/adf/87c/e87/adf87ce873c7ccd7584e07b2c0ea1bb7.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  This photo was taken from the Apollo-8 on December 24, 1968.  ( <i>Someone there complained that NASA is hiding a color photo of the Moon. How is it with color rendering right now?</i> ). <br><br>  The next series of photos relates to the genre of "last look back." <br><br>  The first photo is also recorded in the historical annals <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/672/7a3/ae1/6727a3ae143e0db40418cdaf284c837a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  This is the first in the history of the composition of the Earth and the Moon when viewed from outside our planetary system.  September 18, 1977 Voyager-1 retired 11.6 million kilometers from Earth and took a picture of his homeland. <br><br>  A similar frame from a distance of 8 million km <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/692/ebf/74f/692ebf74fa5dd01e5af8dd3c4abab26c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Made by the European Mars Express, which tested its optical instruments.  In addition to photographing, he was able to analyze the earth's atmosphere and even identified ozone in it. <br><br>  Going to Jupiter turned around and Galileo <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/092/4b7/a95/0924b7a95962e234e53232f7ab36a13a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  He managed to capture the dust storm off the east coast of Australia on December 8, 1992. <br><br>  Proving its undeniable advantage over its European counterpart, the American probe Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter photographed the Earth from a distance of 142 million km. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/251/af8/18f/251af818f1e9b09006f262fde679d605.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  It is this device that allows viewing details of up to 25 cm on the surface of Mars. It also confirms its telescopic abilities in astronomical photography, in particular, on Earth and the Moon. <br><br>  One of the most fascinating photographs of the Earth is not at all like that. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3e5/2e8/14d/3e52e814dd24d65a1fc2934d97752de9.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  A small dot above the left edge of the main ring ... Yes, our baby. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b62/707/59b/b6270759b45e9aad797b4c63939c9d42.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The <a href="">full format is</a> better visible. <br>  This panorama of 165 frames was obtained during a three-hour serial shooting of the Cassini apparatus in Saturn orbit on September 15, 2006.  To Earth - approximately 1.5 billion km <br><br>  And completes our review, a phenomenal shot that is as boring as it‚Äôs incredible. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/292/77a/bf2/29277abf2cb597c6f7e770ba9eeb06f7.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  " <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pale_Blue_Dot">Pale blue point</a> " shot by Voyager-1 from a distance of 6 billion kilometers on February 14, 1990.  At the suggestion of the well-known popularizer of science and space research, Carl Sagan, the device performed the entire ‚Äúfamily portrait‚Äù of the Solar System, which included a blue dot. <br>  This feat may be able to repeat the New Horizons apparatus, but it will happen no less than three years later, so for now this is the most distant image of our common photo with Johnny Depp. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/163433/">https://habr.com/ru/post/163433/</a></p>
