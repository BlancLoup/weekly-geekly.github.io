      If you have a device that participates in the <a href="https://www.google.com/android/beta">Android Beta Testing Program</a> , you will receive a developer preview 4 update in the coming days.  If your device is not included in the program, register it on the <a href="http://www.android.com/beta">site</a> and we will send you an update. <br><br>  Follow the information on the official launch of Android O! <br><br><h2>  What's new? </h2><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Developer Preview 4 is a preliminary version of Android O, which allows you to update and test your applications to the official launch of the new platform.  Developer Preview 4 is already very close to the final version: it includes all the latest fixes and optimizations.  The test system contains API 26 versions, which were available in <a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2017/06/android-o-apis-are-final-get-your-apps.html">Developer Preview 3</a> . <br><br>  We present images of the system Developer Preview 4 for devices, and with it a stable version of Android 26.0.0 Support Library.  The corresponding updates for the SDK, tools and images of the Android Emulator system you will see in the next few days. <br><br>  We also want to share with you an updated version of <a href="http://developers.android.com/testing">Android Testing Support Library</a> , which includes new Android Test Orchestrator, Multiprocess Espresso, and other tools.  Follow the news! <br><br><h2>  Test applications on Android O </h2><br>  The images of the Developer Preview 4 system is a great opportunity to test your applications on the Android O version close to the final one.  Testing will allow you to make sure that your application will work properly after upgrading to a new version of the platform. <br><br>  Register your supported device in the <a href="https://www.google.com/android/beta">Android Beta Testing Program</a> and get access to Developer Preview 4. Then download your app from Google Play and test it - this is what it will look like for a regular user.  Make sure that the interface looks correct, the application starts up quickly and processes <a href="https://developer.android.com/preview/behavior-changes.html">changes in the</a> system <a href="https://developer.android.com/preview/behavior-changes.html">behavior</a> correctly.  In particular, pay attention to the <a href="https://developer.android.com/preview/behavior-changes.html">restrictions</a> on the <a href="https://developer.android.com/preview/behavior-changes.html">transfer of location data in the background</a> , <a href="https://developer.android.com/preview/features/notification-channels.html">alerts</a> , as well as changes that have affected <a href="https://developer.android.com/preview/behavior-changes.html">network connections</a> , <a href="https://developer.android.com/preview/behavior-changes.html">security</a> and <a href="https://developer.android.com/preview/behavior-changes.html">identifiers</a> . <br><br>  If necessary, correct all problems.  Now you can post an update for the app, which will be available after users start receiving invitations to upgrade to Android O. <br>  Enhance apps with new Android O functions and APIs. <br><br>  Users who use the latest versions of Android, as a rule, more often than others, download applications, consume more content and make purchases.  And they are actively reporting that favorite applications should support the latest features of the latest versions of Android.  In Android O, users expect to see in applications such functions as <a href="https://developer.android.com/preview/features/notification-channels.html">notification channels, notification</a> <a href="https://developer.android.com/preview/features/notification-badges.html">points</a> , <a href="https://developer.android.com/preview/features/pinning-shortcuts-widgets.html">dock labels</a> , <a href="https://developer.android.com/preview/api-overview.html">picture in picture</a> , <a href="https://developer.android.com/preview/features/autofill.html">autocomplete</a> , etc. These same functions will help your application in the future to attract new users who will be switching to Android O platform <br><br>  In Android O, shortcuts can be brought to the main screen directly from the application.  This feature will help increase user interest in the application.  (left) <br><br>  Notification points keep users active in the application and allow them to go straight to key functions.  (on right) <br><br>  Improving your application with the new Android O features will help you attract users, offer them new types of interaction, provide them with even higher levels of control and security, and increase application performance.  Features such as responsive <a href="https://developer.android.com/preview/features/adaptive-icons.html">icons</a> , <a href="https://developer.android.com/preview/features/downloadable-fonts.html">downloadable fonts,</a> and <a href="https://developer.android.com/preview/features/autosizing-textview.html">automatic text resizing in TextView</a> will simplify application development and reduce the size of the APK file.  Battery life also plays an important role for users, so they will appreciate the optimization of your application, taking into account the <a href="https://developer.android.com/preview/features/background.html">limitations of background work</a> and other important <a href="https://developer.android.com/preview/behavior-changes.html">changes in system behavior when launching applications on the Android O platform</a> . <br><br>  Visit <a href="https://developer.android.com/preview/index.html">the Android O version for developers</a> to learn about all the new features and APIs, and how to embed them in your applications. <br><br><h2>  Develop faster with Android Studio </h2><br>  When you're ready to work with Android O, download the latest version of <a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2017/05/android-studio-3-0-canary1.html">Android Studio 3.0</a> , available <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/preview/index.html">here</a> .

When you're ready, download the updated alpha, beta or working version of your application. <br><br>  Make sure that the updated application runs on both Android O and earlier versions of Android.
