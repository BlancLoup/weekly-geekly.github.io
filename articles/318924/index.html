  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Problem Statement: Accounting Objects and Modeling Relationships Between Them</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Models are created by the analyst in order to make this or that part of the domain clear.  The model is built using accounting objects and the relations between them.  The object of accounting is understood as everything that we have called: assets, processes, events, structures, sets, etc.  At the same time, it seems that we all know what ‚Äúunderstanding‚Äù is, however, it is worthwhile to talk about this in a bit more detail. <br><br>  As a result of training, a person becomes accustomed to the fact that there are some patterns that are repeated from time to time.  For example, if you lift a stone and let it go, it will fall to the ground.  And so it will be whenever this pattern repeats.  Knowing that an object falls to the ground is an empirical experience that does not require an explanation.  Everyone who lives on Earth, this fact seems obvious, does not require any explanation, no proof, that is, it is understandable.  This knowledge looks like: <br><br><ol><li>  Empirical experience is the set (class) of situations that are regarded by a given subject as being similar to each other (the subject dropped objects).  The new situations are classified by the subject as similar to the previous ones and replenish the class of similar situations. </li><li>  The pattern of situations (the type of situations, or the model of situations) that is present in the consciousness of the subject and in which it is recorded that whenever this happens, the body falls to the ground.  The pattern is associated with empirical experience, or with a class of situations. </li></ol><br>  Total: there are situations whose models are stored in the mind of the subject, there is a model of these models - a pattern that is also stored in the mind of the subject.  All together it gives a person a sense of understanding.

      However, for a person born in space and having spent his whole life in weightlessness, the fact that a stone falls to the ground will not be obvious and will require an explanation. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bea/3cc/f05/bea3ccf0535846358a535bc89b9d97e7.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The analyst, building models for the target audience, reduces something unknown for this audience to patterns known to this audience.  When the reader "reads" this model and sees how the unknown has been reduced to a set of known patterns, he passes the first level of understanding - agreement with the fact that the model is correct.  (In this case, it is necessary to talk separately about the rules of such a conclusion and methods of proof).  Further, the reader can create a pattern that is inherent in this model and practice using it in other places.  When he succeeds, the person moves to the second level of understanding - the ability to use a new pattern.  Therefore, understanding is associated with the following mental functions: <br><br><ol><li>  The ability to allocate accounting objects </li><li>  The ability to build patterns, or types </li><li>  The ability to classify accounting objects in accordance with the constructed types </li><li>  The ability to build relationships between accounting objects </li><li>  The ability to draw conclusions. </li></ol><br>  But before building relationships between accounting objects, the analyst must build a reality model that describes the relations of accounting objects in space-time.  For example, before you say that the bridge's ropes hold the roadway, I must say that there are ropes, there is a roadway, that one end of each rope has a common spatial-temporal part with the roadway, or that the same thing - the ropes and the roadway intersect in space - time.  Only then can the subject interpret these common parts as attachment of cables to a bridge, which transfer the load from the sheet to the cables.  Without highlighting these common parts, it is possible to say that the cables are holding the canvas, but such a model will contain a conclusion without the facts on the basis of which this conclusion was made.  It is as if we knew the decision of the court, but did not know the facts on the basis of which the judge made his conclusions. <br><br>  Very often, metamodels offer modeling of such conclusions without modeling facts, on the basis of which such conclusions could be drawn, for example, in the IDEF0 metamodel, functions are interconnected by object flows, and have no common parts that would allow to conclude that there are streams.  As a result, we are not able to build different interpretations of facts, or we cannot build models that would take into account multiple points of view.  For example, in IDEF0 it is impossible to simulate the fact of rendering consulting services, because by definition, a service is not accompanied by a material carrier, and, therefore, there are no flows of objects.  Relations between accounting objects in 4-dimensional space-time have not yet been carefully studied, so building models in which facts are modeled is difficult.  My task in the following articles is to describe the possible relationships, classify them, and tell what speech turns some particular space-time relationships are hidden.  In the end, I will tell you what a clock function is, how this function is related to an event class, and I‚Äôll tell you about this event class. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/318924/">https://habr.com/ru/post/318924/</a></p>
