      ... And now the lights go out.  The rustle in the hall subsides, and he steps on the stage ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  - Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen!  Did you wait for me? <br>  (Stormy ovations in the hall) <br>  - Have you been waiting for the IT revolution? <br>  (Even louder ovations) <br>  - Have you been waiting for something that will change your ideas about the world? <br>  (Hall rampages) <br>  - Congratulations!  You will witness the incredible! <br>  (Viewers jump up and chant: "James! James! James and his Scrapple!") <br><br>  - Yes, our company starts the new year of 2010 with the introduction of a special revolutionary product, but first I will tell you a little story. <br><br>  ‚ÄúOnce upon a time, Office Man was back in 2010.  Everything, whatever he did, was connected with the IT sphere.  Office Man loved his work, and he was a professional.  Coming in the morning to his office, he, as usual, turned on a stationary computer.  While the work programs were being loaded, while the planners were receiving diffs from the server, while the window with colleagues' contacts was opening, and while the programming environments were running, stuffed with various tools, the Man brought the workplace to its usual form.  First of all, he removed his bag from his shoulder and pulled out a laptop, then he took a communicator from one pocket, from another - a mobile hard drive in a stylish blue box, from the third - a pack of CDs, and one good little player.  All this household Man conveniently located on two desktops.  The laptop has already been introduced to the local network via Gigabit LAN, and the communicator is synchronized with the access point, and the stationary computer has issued a message that it is ready to work. <br><br>  Office Man was a professional in his field, and as any professional, he liked various multifunction devices.  He loved to carry them in his pocket, knowing that he could always use them to create a note, call friends or find out if it would rain in half an hour.  And then, it was so great to just hold in your hands: stylish, round, well in hand, pleasant to the touch and always a little warm - yes, he knew that they would not replace human warmth - but they were so warming him alone soul!  And in his childhood he loved different designers;  connecting devices to each other reminded him of the carelessness of past years and gave a sense of freedom.  Office Man has always been able to access the Internet from his mobile phone and read the necessary information.  If the framework of the small screen became cramped, he connected the phone to a laptop - and now he had at his disposal a full-fledged mobile Internet, limited only by the charge of the batteries of both devices.  When Man didn‚Äôt have any money on his cell phone, he simply went to one of the secluded places and entered the wireless network.  Without the Internet, without IT-news and without colleagues living all over the world, Office Man could not, because in this harsh time, when the idea that occurred to some engineer-inventor was becoming obsolete at that very second, at that moment compressed and time full of information, a person, in order to remain professional, must always be up to date. <br><br>  Then one day, Man walked along a deserted alley, where he loved to wander in quiet evenings.  Look, - and on the track is a strange device.  Most of all, it looked like a medium-sized communicator: a flat rectangular case, rounded edges, comfortable in the palm of your hand, gray metal ... But there was no screen, no slots, no holes, no camera, this device had nothing, only one round button.  Without thinking twice, the Man pressed the button, - and ... Nothing happened.  Or it happened that he, being in this time, space and information field, could not notice.  The man even connected to the Internet, but did not find anything about his unusual find.  He decided that he needed to consult with his colleagues, you see, and the collective mind should overcome the riddle.  And the man went to work. <br><br>  After a few steps, he stopped.  Alley for some reason seemed unfamiliar to him.  Are the houses prettier?  Or the light of the setting sun broke in the trees?  There was some lightness in everything ... Then he suddenly realized that it was his bag that lost weight.  The man was seriously scared.  He sat down on a bench to check if everything was in place.  What was his surprise, mixed with fright, when a neat A4-size tablet with glossy metal edging, with a black border around the screen, devoid of buttons and rough edges was found in the bag ... The tablet - and Man had no doubt that it was a representative of the Tablet PC, - lay under the straps where a laptop was half an hour ago.  Having grieved about the loss, the Man decided to examine the little thing.  Suddenly there is some clue what happened to the laptop? <br><br>  The tablet turned on as befits any decent computer.  A finger-oriented interface of some kind of operating system appeared on the screen.  The main icons immediately caught the eye: Mail, Internet, Movies and Music, Scheduler and Calendar, Text Editor ... In addition, the Information Channels icon was lit in the lower right corner.  She caught the attention of Man.  Pressing it, he felt the screen under his finger slightly bent and "shoved" the surface back: as if it was a real button.  On the screen, meanwhile, a window was opened, divided into two parts.  The upper block was an illustration-links to the latest news of the IT-world.  The news was divided into categories and provided with small announcements.  Obviously, the tablet took them from the Internet;  with several movements, one could tune in to podcasts and video channels, interesting newsletters, add an alert about new topics, and the siren could either emit a sound signal or read the topic header with an electronic voice.  If you are interested in something, then, without taking the tablet out of the bag, you can look at its contents on the phone, browse and, for example, send it to the basket ... Accepted articles automatically accumulate in offline folders, and the most interesting ones flicker quietly on the desktop tablet, waiting for when they are deployed and revered.  In addition, any article could be commented out (and in some cases even edited), made selected or sent to a friend.  And even more interesting is the mail: the letters from the boss that came through the mail channel will be marked as important and they will be an eyesore before reading them ... Something like this Man has already seen, but nevertheless he was surprised by the convenience, pleasant design and intelligence of the interface. <br><br>  He was already captured by the research gadget and did not notice what was happening around.  Having breathed in more air, the Man opened wide the second block of information channels.  What was his surprise when he saw the familiar logos and names!  Here is the cafe "Almalexia", located around the corner;  here is the Drive Internet Club;  and these three points are local computer stores.  Sticking to one of them, the Man saw not only current prices, but also an invitation to inspect the goods on video, and even consult on-line with the store employee!  Yes, these were local information channels that are publicly available.  Each of the channels was unique.  Computer stores allowed you to connect the remote desktop of a laptop in the window and, thus, help in the selection;  from here it was possible to place an order, pay for it with electronic money and, upon entering the store, pick up the goods;  or make a menu in a cafe, while still a few blocks from it;  or download the latest issue of the local e-newspaper, just passing by their office and news distribution points.  Of course, some of the services were paid, but no one and nothing forced to pay for what you do not need. <br><br>  And then he came up with an interesting idea that needs to be urgently written down, otherwise it just disappears suddenly, because the memory is such a capricious thing ... Opening the text editor, the Man saw the QWERTY on-screen keyboard on the tablet screen.  He knew how to type blindly, but he strongly doubted the convenience of the touch panel ... For the sake of experiment, he closed his eyes and pointed his fingers to where there should be risks from the letters F and J on ordinary keyboards. And they were there: slightly convex peas in barely visible frames !  This screen had feedback, which was already a great achievement of engineers. <br><br>  Opening his eyes, the man thought that now he was dragging his fingers across the screen, and there he was already typing heaps of different letters, he would have to delete.  Not at all: in order for the virtual buttons to work, you need to press a little harder, and not just touch it.  And - yes, when pressed, the surface of the screen slightly distends with a pea, announcing that it, pressing, happened ... Without difficulty and inconvenience, Man threw the message, kept it and was pleased with these advanced technologies.  At the fingertips for a long time there was a feeling of bouncing buttons. <br><br>  He sighed.  He could not even dream of such a thing.  He raised his head to look around - and everything was spinning around, his eyes darkening slightly.  Fortunately, it quickly passed, only a slight disorientation in space remained.  The man did not remember whether he had passed Ugdanskaya Street along the avenue, or had not yet reached her.  In the dullness of the evening dusk, he could not distinguish between the names of streets and shops ... But by accidentally pressing a button on the tablet, he saw a map of the nearest local information channels, and it immediately became clear where he was.  And it's true, around the corner - a cafe, and behind - a computer store! <br><br>  The man tried to enlarge the map, but with one finger it was inconvenient.  Then he intuitively turned to multi-touch functions, zooming in and out with the familiar movement of both index fingers.  It amused him so much that in a couple of minutes both hands were tired of the strain.  He lowered them, and the tablet, lying on his lap, suddenly became useless ... Or?  Having pondered, the Man pulled the two edges of the tablet, and two rectangular panels with the size of an average PDA appeared on the darkness.  Sockets separated from the tablet, becoming separate devices.  The man smiled.  Putting the panels so that his hands were above them, but in a relaxed state, he began to control two cursors on the screen.  So, here they are, the external multi-touch panels, the man thought to himself ... <br><br>  ... What did he want?  Oh, yes, exactly, to go to work, there are now several of his colleagues solving an important programmer problem;  It‚Äôs good to talk to them about the emergency.  Not fully aware of his actions, the Man presses "Contacts", selects one of the colleagues and calls him ... They do not take the call, however, the contact status indicates that the colleague is still at the office even at the office and busy.  Well, it's not that much to go to work.  The man wanted to put the tablet in a laptop bag, as he noticed something else in it.  These were special belts spilling over the neck.  On them, the tablet was fixed on four points horizontally: in the ‚Äúacross the chest‚Äù position it looked like a fifth wheel.  And although you could always squint your eyes down and see what is being done on the screen, the feeling that you look ridiculous did not leave.  Sticking the touch panels into his pockets, the Man tried to walk: there was no one around, they would not see.  Hmmm ... On the one hand, it is inconvenient, unusual, and somehow absurd;  on the other hand, I turned on the video without taking my hands out of my pockets, and go on yourselves ... Keeps well, snaps on, will not fall ... Soon he wanted to experiment more.  He turned the straps so that the tablet was on the forearm of his right hand: neither give nor take, a huge watch.  Although for hours he was heavy. <br><br>  ... Here is the building where he works.  Just think about it!  Ordinary locks were changed to electronic ones, authorization on the retina of the eye and thumb print ... It's just fantastic!  Already the usual movement, the Man touches the touch panel in his pocket, and the lock on the door opens, and there ... And there is light, light, light ... " <br><br>  The lights came on in the studio.  The charming voice of James calmed down somewhere in the strong ceiling ceiling.  James himself was sitting in the chair, his chin with his fist thoughtfully.  The audience in the hall slowly began to awaken.  What was it?  Dreams?  Very bright dreams?  Only the presenter knew the answer.  He smiled and stood up: <br><br>  - So, ladies and gentlemen, that Hour has come, Hour, When Everything Changes.  Now you will see this revolutionary device, sales of which will begin tomorrow.  Attention to the screen! .. <br><br>  And a photo appeared on the screen: a flat rectangular case, rounded edges, comfortable in the palm of your hand, gray metal and only one button in the center. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/82299/">https://habr.com/ru/post/82299/</a></p>
