  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The effectiveness of Internet marketing cleaning services</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Interview with <a href="http://www.primex.ru/" title="Primex">Primex</a> ‚Äôs marketing manager (cleaning services), Elena Smirnova: ‚ÄúAbout half of the company's new customers will find out about services via the Internet.‚Äù <br>  <strong>- Elena, in what year did Primex create its website and why at this particular time?</strong> <br>  - We launched the site in 2001.  This was the moment when the level of development of our company and the competitive environment were ripe for doing business on the Internet.  Then it was a matter of prestige - to have a website, i.e.  every self-respecting company has created its own website. <br>  <strong>- Why did you choose Vipro as a site promotion service provider?</strong> <br>  - As far as I remember, we didn‚Äôt even consider other options - we were simply recommended by someone from our partners.  Therefore, we decided not to risk it and trusted Vipro to <a href="http://www.vipro.ru/services/development/">create the site</a> and <a href="http://www.vipro.ru/services/promotion/optimization/">promote the site in search engines</a> .  The start was very successful, and today I am very pleased with the work of Vipro. <br>  <strong>- Nice to hear it, thanks.</strong>  <strong>And tell me more - what part of your customers comes through the Internet?</strong> <br>  ‚ÄúAbout half of our new customers will find out about our services through the site.‚Äù <br>  <strong>- I guess at the expense of what you are trying to achieve ...</strong> <br>  - Absolutely right.  According to key inquiries for us, such as <a href="http://www.yandex.ru/yandsearch%3Frpt%3Drad%26amp%3Btext%3D%25EC%25FB%25F2%25FC%25E5%2B%25EE%25EA%25EE%25ED" title="window cleaning">washing windows</a> , <a href="http://www.yandex.ru/yandsearch%3Frpt%3Drad%26amp%3Btext%3D%25EA%25EB%25E8%25ED%25E8%25ED%25E3" title="cleaning">cleaning</a> , <a href="http://www.yandex.ru/yandsearch%3Ftext%3D%25F3%25E1%25EE%25F0%25EA%25E0%2B%25EF%25EE%25EC%25E5%25F9%25E5%25ED%25E8%25E9%26amp%3Bstype%3Dwww" title="room cleaning">cleaning the premises</a> , etc., we are consistently in the top three search engine Yandex sites.  This provides us with approximately 140 visitors per working day. <br>  <strong>- Not bad for b2b services.</strong>  <strong>And what part of them addresses you by phone or by mail?</strong> <br>  - Unfortunately, we do not keep such statistics yet.  However, I hope that in the near future we will change this. <br>  <strong>- Let's try to compare the effectiveness of online advertising compared to other channels of communication.</strong>  <strong>What other advertising or pr technologies does Primex use?</strong> <br>  - Everything is simple here.  We have 4 main channels to promote services: outdoor advertising, participation in industry exhibitions, the Internet and print advertising.  We publish advertising modules in the magazines ‚ÄúProfessional Cleaning‚Äù, ‚ÄúYour Business‚Äù, ‚ÄúThe Secret of the Firm‚Äù, etc. Plus, from time to time there are thematic publications mentioning Primex in the context of cleaning services or the development of the franchise network.  Recently, a franchising business scheme has been actively developing, therefore journalists who write on the topic often come to us for comments. <br>  - With print and outdoor all is clear.  And at exhibitions - are you renting stands or promotions? <br>  - Of course, we rent stands.  At the same time, especially for participation in exhibitions, we invite and train young employees.  Recently, these are students of economics and linguistic faculties of Moscow State University.  Thus, we kill two birds with one stone - we save time for client managers and prepare qualified specialists for ourselves.  For example, we recruit one of our female student employees to work on the development of the franchise network in the regions.  As in Japan ... only there, from school, do corporations look after the younger generation :-) <br>  <strong>- OK.</strong>  <strong>Now, to more accurately assess the return on investment from online advertising, tell me, what part of the company's budget goes to online promotion?</strong> <br>  - If we are talking about the annual budget, then the last 2-3 years we spend more than 35% of the marketing budget on the Internet. <br>  <strong>Personally, these figures convince me of something - by investing a third of the budget on the Internet, you get 50% of clients!</strong>  <strong>Although the profitability of projects that you receive from customers who come through printing, may be on average higher.</strong> <br><br>  Interviewed by Yury Vilnid </div>
