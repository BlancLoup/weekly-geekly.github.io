  <section class="page js-page"><h1>As we launched a TV channel on the Internet. Equipment</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  This is the third article ( <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/mass_media/126420/">first</a> and <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/mass_media/127119/">second</a> ) of the planned cycle ‚ÄúHow we launched the channel‚Äù.  Today I will talk about the technical support of the <a href="http://dog-channel.tv/">DOG CHANNEL TV channel</a> and how it all works ... The article contains a lot of specialized vocabulary for broadcasting.  If it is clear from the comments that something is not clear, I will clarify and specify specific points as needed. <br><a name="habracut"></a>  So... <br><br><h5>  PART ONE.  AT FIRST, THE INSTALLATION WAS ... </h5><br>  Strange as it may sound, but personally I consider content to be the main asset of such projects.  Channel specialized.  Talk about mass purchases of content is not necessary.  it <ul><li>  expensive due to specificity; </li><li>  virtually no offer. </li></ul>  Therefore, this particular channel was born from hundreds of days spent in the installation, when the next program ‚ÄúJust a Dog‚Äù was born. <br><br>  Now about the technical requirements, on which bitrate to broadcast? 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      On the one hand, you can easily give an SD format picture (this is 720x576 pixels), on the other hand, a larger frame size is a larger bitrate, in order to maintain an acceptable quality.  By trial, error and heated discussions, we stopped at the size of 500x374 pixels, and the bitrate is about 750-800 kbit / s.  On the one hand, it provides an acceptable quality, on the other - anyone who has megabit Internet can watch our channel consistently and comfortably. <br><br><h5>  PART TWO.  THERE WILL NOT BE TURN OUT FROM A SONG, OR ANY FLY WITH ... </h5><br>  It should be said that the site of the program at the time of the creation of the channel already existed.  It is written on the basis of CMS JOOMLA.  And as soon as the broadcast parameters were formulated, the question arose of creating a content delivery system for the end user. <br><br>  It is clear that this was most easily implemented using Flash.  Test broadcasts were going to literally "on the knee."  The scheme was as follows: <br>  The signal source (either just files, or a DV signal from a tape recorder in general) clung to a virtual camera, which was then sent to a free service, such as <a href="http://www.ustream.tv/">ustream.tv</a> . <br><br>  <b>All right ... There is a channel!</b> <br><br>  Yeah, right now, sir ... those who believed - imagine yourself, sitting for days in front of the computer and changing the splash screen-programs forever ... And all this has to be put together, calculated by time, and praying that God forbid you do not turn off the Internet.  In general, as a scheme - yes, but as a base - I had to build everything from scratch and myself. <br><br>  So, what would you like to receive? <br>  - the content lies on a server somewhere in a data center with good thick and reliable channels. <br>  - there is a media server (servers) that distribute content to visitors. <br>  - the scheme should be stable and easily expandable. <br>  - for the future.  Create playlists. <br>  - for the future.  Automation of accounting, verification and content conversion. <br>  - minimization of costs. <br><br>  It is the stage of searching, trial and error.  From what was ‚Äúin sight‚Äù - this is Adobe Flash Media Server, Wowza Media Server, Red5 Media Server. <br>  <b>Adobe:</b> <br>  pros: <br>  - reliable solution <br>  - technical support <br>  - actually, they invented the RTMP protocol <br>  minuses: <br>  - asking for money <br>  - put on WINDOWS <br>  - source is closed <br><br>  <b>Wowza:</b> <br>  - convenient and reliable enough <br>  - technical support <br>  - can be put on Linux <br>  - you can stream for iPhone &amp; Co <br>  minuses: <br>  - asking for money <br>  - under heavy loads "floats" <br><br>  <b>Red5</b> <br>  - is free <br>  minuses: <br>  - ‚Äúfloats‚Äù already at medium loads <br><br>  Something is my personal opinion, something is read on the Internet.  Personally, I was most inclined towards Wowza. <br><br>  But, as always, the case intervened in the case.  Absolutely by chance, I stumbled upon the project of Muscovite Maxim Lapshin of <a href="http://erlyvideo.org/">Erlyvideo media server</a> .  The language of ERLANG, in which it was written - for me - is pure exotic.  But!!!  Basic server functionality is free.  Reliability is high.  Reviews - in general, different, but mostly positive.  And I decided to take a chance.  (What is now not a bit sorry) <br><br>  So <b>Erlyvideo</b> : <br>  - free (or rather, conditionally free. I‚Äôll tell you more about this) <br>  - going from source (which means, with a certain perseverance put, anywhere) <br>  - now it is gaining momentum (on the one hand, the community is not as big as we would like, on the other hand, it‚Äôs enough just to go directly to the creator and get a tip on the issue of interest to you) <br>  minuses: <br>  - additional functionality - for money <br>  - hard to find a good erlang-e programmer <br>  - as a result of free of charge, a possible change in functionality in the new version without warning. <br><br><h5>  PART THREE.  HEROIC ... </h5><br>  We have rented a dedicated server.  It has UBUNTU and ERLYVIDEO installed. <br><br>  On the erlyvideo forum, you can get an answer to the question asked, almost always, on the same day.  For what the author, as they say, respect and respect.  But!  As a rule, the answer contains the direction where to move, and the fundamental possibility or impossibility to achieve the result.  Once again, this refers to the additional functionality!  As for configuring and fixing bugs - here everything is absolutely adequate.  The remaining thirty-three fun - through tech support for licensed customers. <br><br>  The position is absolutely clear to me, although it‚Äôs probably a hot iron melted into our mentality, I would like to be on the list of exceptions.  ))) (Well, sorry. I can't do anything about it) <br><br>  Once the media server has earned, it is time to tweak the functionality for yourself.  What can I say ... Erlang, it turns out, can be learned fairly quickly.  The server is really surprisingly stable.  For me, and now it remains something magical that you can update the version of the server without interrupting the broadcast !!!  And this is the functionality of the language itself.  Awesome scalability and flexibility.  D-ah-ah ... if you are a fan and are ready to slack off time and energy to deal with all this. <br>  We had no money, so we were ready.  First, a playlist broadcast system was needed.  Then I wanted to dynamically generate the program.  Then restart the playlist without breaking the broadcast.  On the way - user authorization and chat for users. <br><br>  The server is really very stable.  Behaves predictably and very adequately, if so you can talk about the server. <br><br>  Almost from scratch had to rewrite the player itself.  Both future authorization and chat require very specific functionality.  If someone needs a decent lightweight and free player, I highly recommend the <a href="http://www.tarantinov.ru/portfolio/detail.php%3FID%3D8">tarantinov player</a> .  It was he who was taken as the basis for creating his player. <br><br>  A serious test in all aspects, including technical, awaits us in early October, during the online broadcast of the German Shepherd Dog Training World Championship in Kiev.  We will be glad to any help or cooperation in holding this event.  Especially with regard to server load capacity, load balancing, etc.  But it is in a personal. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/288874/">https://habr.com/ru/post/288874/</a></p>
