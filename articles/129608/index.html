Not difficult.  Reliably  Handsomely. <br>  With pictures and drawings. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/3d35f909/b39e3da8/8f7f693b/78c3f49c.jpg"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Idea </h4><br>  Many people use laptops at home.  Many with an external monitor.  Some, like me, barely wear it anywhere.  Almost all the time, the laptop lonely collects dust, taking up space next to the monitor tied to it with ropes of wires. <br>  At the same time, the mass of the monitors has a standard (VESA) rear connector for mounting on the wall, which almost no one uses.  It looks like four holes for screws in the very center of the back cover.  In fact, the holes in plastic are holes in plastic, and the thread is in an iron frame inside the case, which will bear the load if you hang the monitor on the wall. <br>  Without thinking twice (almost half a year, then one thing, then another, aha), superficially googling the Internet and not finding anything similar, I decided to combine one with another, since the idea was completely unsophisticated, even for a man who never did anything with his hands, but he was familiar with the computer .

    <h4>  Stage One - Project </h4><br>  VESA specifications were found to be absolutely commonplace - 75x75, 100x100 and 125x125 (almost never found on monitors, only for huge TVs).  Own holes in the monitor of the Samsung P2450H (100x100), measurements of the laptop (MacBook Pro 15) are measured, the length is divided in half, added to half the distance between the holes, and so on, completely trivial calculations for the layout already estimated in the mind. <br>  The model is drawn in an autocade, a three-dimensional model, a flat scan of the workpiece to be cut out and a three-projection drawing.  All 1 to 1 and where necessary with the size.  (files of drawings at the end of the article). <br><br><h4>  Stage two - manufacturing </h4><br>  In general, the plan was to order the manufacture of someone from a heap of firms placed on the Internet ‚Äúcutting and bending metal to order according to customer‚Äôs drawings‚Äù and then a file occurred - all phone companies responded as standard: either ‚Äúnot working with individuals‚Äù or ‚Äúorder from 10,000 rubles. "  At 10,000 rubles at their prices turned out about 100 parts.  It would be possible to salt them.  And in general I was not going to spend that kind of money on it.  Then it seemed to me that the case had died, but my father came to the rescue, with whom I accidentally discussed this pichal.  Though he has been working in commerce for a long time, but in close connection with various labor collectives and craftsmen of them, one of which he promised to give to my drawings.  And he gave.  At first, the truth was enough to make fun of them, because he himself was a natural Soviet engineer of the Moscow State Technical University named after Bauman, and he scolded my scribbles in full.  So if someone wants to tell which lamer drawings - don‚Äôt bother yourself, I‚Äôve already listened to all the bile. <br>  Nevertheless, according to these drawings, I suddenly produced exactly what I wanted and even more surprisingly well.  And fast.  Here's what dad brought back: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/0355d441/a047f7ca/8b1bb40d/29f5042e.jpg"><br><br>  Do not look at the fact that the specimen looks flimsy - this is steel 1.5 millimeters - it is adequately strong. <br>  Holes under 100x100 and under 75x75, if you really do, so universally. <br>  A small indent from the monitor, in order for the laptop not to lean closely, not to warm the monitor and not to warm itself from it. <br>  After that, for a long time, the father who ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt take the checkers in his hands,‚Äù even the part painted by the idea that had caught fire with the idea.  It turned out almost all industrial: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/cba7a047/df2d4cf9/16e5238e/9c1b2457.jpg"><br><br>  After that, on the inner surface of those parts of which the laptop will touch, in order not to scratch it with iron, a loose old leather belt was glued: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/841cad4c/55229242/4cf9106e/17a1be26.jpg"><br><br>  Bottom line assembly: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/6a22ef09/c53e106e/fbd0928a/ebdb1142.jpg"><br><br>  The result has lost a bit of its ‚Äúfactoryness‚Äù, but still it hangs there where no one will see it. <br><br><h4>  Stage Three - Build </h4><br>  Screwed onto the monitor: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/67895224/6472f52d/32f7c435/195f16a2.jpg"><br><br><h4>  The whole assembly is in place. </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/0fbe81ec/8d28a6a1/90d32081/57ad4dd0.jpg"><br><br>  Well, actually, the result: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/6ac109bb/80b737f7/2099a8cd/5834b85c.jpg"><br><br><h4>  A small collection of answers to obvious questions: </h4><br><h5>  Is the laptop warming up? </h5><br>  Not heated at all.  I checked my monitor - it is completely cold behind me, though not a LED.  Well, besides this, the laptop is 1.5 centimeters away from the monitor.  Plus, the ventilation holes of the macbook are strictly behind and in this position they are obtained from above, where hot air tends from it.  In general, with this full order. <br><br><h5>  Did the monitor lean back under the weight of the laptop back losing balance? </h5><br>  My - did not lean back, although I was afraid of this, but he surprisingly remained absolutely still, although he possesses the whole range of branded Samsung "features" - the play of plastic parts, and the bumpiness, if you touch it. <br><br><h5>  Do not pull a heavy laptop mount from the monitor? </h5><br>  Not exactly to throw up.  The VESA mount is a mount in an iron frame inside the monitor that is slightly visible in the holes and which holds almost all the insides on it. <br><br><h5>  And how to turn off and on if the button is inside? </h5><br>  In sleep mode, keep it up.  All from the keyboard.  It's a laptop ... Although this is certainly the most ambiguous moment, if it hangs, it will be necessary to remove, open, turn off, turn on, remove ... But it hangs twice in two years, the work is quite feasible. <br><br><h4>  Drawing files: </h4><br>  <a href="">autocad project</a> <br>  <a href="http://red-stars.ru/backstand_plot.pdf">three projection model</a> <br>  <a href="http://red-stars.ru/backstand_plan.pdf">iron sheet cutting part (with dimensions)</a> <br>  <a href="">piece for cutting from iron sheet (with dimensions)</a> jpeg picture </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/129608/">https://habr.com/ru/post/129608/</a></p>
