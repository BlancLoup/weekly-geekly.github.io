  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Optimal eBay Trading: Research</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The phenomenon of auction trading on the Internet is of undoubted interest for scientists of different profiles.  Such a huge site like <a href="http://ebay.com/">eBay</a> provides rich food for various studies.  Professors of marketing, economics, management and psychology have already published dozens of scientific papers about eBay.  BusinessWeek magazine has compiled a squeeze out of all these monographs: here is a short list of <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/smallbiz/content/sep2006/sb20060907_223337.htm">tips for efficient trading</a> on online auctions.  These are tricks that allow you to sell at the maximum price, and buy at the minimum. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  1. The <b>low starting price</b> attracts auction participants who are psychologically determined to buy goods even after a significant increase in bids.  British economists have discovered that digital cameras for 1 cent are sold much more expensive than usual.  The lower the starting price, the higher the result of the bidding for the lot. <br><br>  2. Many "nervous" sellers are afraid to sell goods cheaply and therefore set the <b>minimum acceptable price for the</b> end of the auction.  In this case, trades attract less participants and the final price is lower. <br><br>  3. Auctions with <b>photos are</b> always much more popular than auctions without photos.  And the higher the traffic - the more active the bidding and the higher the final price.  Scientists from Stanford determined that the appearance of one additional bidder for a product increases the final price of the product by an average of 5.5%.  This is for auctions in which there were at least two bidders before.  If absolutely all auctions are taken into account, the increase will be even more significant: 11.4%.

      4. Advice for sellers: <b>do not flood the market with</b> similar goods.  It is better to sell them gradually.  And not all at once.  This is where the balance of supply and demand works. <br><br>  5. Check <b>grammar</b> .  British scientists found out that Michael Jordan‚Äôs T-shirts are sold much worse if the word ‚ÄúMicheal‚Äù is indicated in the product description with an error. <br><br>  6. Promote the goods with the help of <b>slogans</b> and indicate the high <b>price of goods in the store</b> .  According to researchers, an indication of the high price in the store increases the final cost of the lot by 7%. <br><br>  7. Hold <b>long auctions</b> .  The study showed.  That the price of lots at the three-and five-day auctions practically does not differ, but with an increase in the duration of the auction to seven days, the price increases by 24%, and as a result of the ten-day auction, the price is already 42% higher than the average. <br><br>  8. Do not use <b>peak hours of</b> site <b>traffic</b> as time to end trading.  Although at first glance it seems that at such a time there will be more buyers, but in fact the final price of lots at peak hours is 9.6% lower, because at that time there is a much greater turnover.  Approximately 35% of all goods are sold between 17.00 and 20.59, and only 25% of the rates are made at this time. <br><br>  9. Take a <b>small shipping charge</b> .  Studies have shown that buyers during trading almost do not pay attention to the cost of delivery.  Because of this, CDs with a starting price of 1 cent and shipping charges of $ 3.99 are sold at an average of 21% more expensive than CDs with an initial cost of $ 4 and free shipping.  But if you specify too high a delivery price, the goods may not be sold at all. <br><br>  10. Avoid <b>negative feedback</b> .  Numerous studies show that the presence of positive feedback from the seller increases the activity of buyers. <br><br>  Ten of the above tips are applicable not only for sellers, but also for buyers, only for them the opposite principle applies: you need to buy at peak hours, choose auctions with a higher starting price, goods without photos, short auctions and lots with fewer competitors. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/4388/">https://habr.com/ru/post/4388/</a></p>
