Overview of Recommended Consoles</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Your fidget does not know what to do with you in the queue?  Are there footprints in the father's car already on the ceiling?  Is the child in the spotlight in public transport?  Then this article is for you!  Indeed, to occupy or distract children at times is sometimes necessary, and the devices discussed in this review will help you with this. <br><br>  The question arises: ‚ÄúWhy does the child have a console, when is it easier to give a smartphone or a modern game console?‚Äù The answer is simple, because children do not always treat their things with care and accuracy, what can we say about father's tablet or mother‚Äôs smartphone.  If you have children under the age of 8-10 years, then you probably already burned, and those who have to go through this difficult path, it is better to be in the subject and well prepared! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/627/6e4/5d7/6276e45d7a8a434285fae60a6b8f20a3.png">

The cross is separate, does not cause false positives and complaints.  Want to give your child Mario, Turtles with Batman?  You are welcome!  All the best to children. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/83d/464/31b/83d46431b7284ca4b8cf76686ffc4f54.png"><br><br>  To give away your smartphone or tablet is at best to take it away by stained, and in fact it happens much worse than the situation.  The child gives your expensive device scratched, with a torn usb port or even broken.  In this case, the simplest gaming systems with built-in "without problems" games will come to the rescue.  All you have to do is insert the batteries and give it to the child. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Disassembled device</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/50e/c51/09f/50ec5109f2f243e4b0fe3625e99d0a76.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1c2/05e/1c9/1c205e1c91bb49d18a4c5df9dec33d23.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/967/267/034/96726703408b45c0acf30609bfe3ff7a.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/faf/9aa/ecd/faf9aaecd0bd4ad098877cde716d7411.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a99/fde/b64/a99fdeb64e054b61b26429cd542a9ed7.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/656/cdd/d1e/656cddd1efef4931ab806d5361aa8c56.jpg"><br><br></div></div><br><br>  ‚ñå <a href="http://www.exeq.ru/produkcija/pristavki/detskie/rainbow.html">EXEQ RAINBOW</a> - this console has its own games, somewhat reminiscent of JAVA or FLASH in the amount of 111 pieces, there is an AV output and a connector for a 5V charger.  AV output can be used as a headphone output.  In this model, the speaker is in the front of the device.  The display, unlike TOY, has grown to 2.7 inches, and the resolution, as it were, remains 320x240.  The cross is one-piece, ideal for an adult's thumb, but the child does not feel any discomfort.  This is the only prefix in which there is an AV cable supplied, which, by the way, is also suitable for EXEQ GURU. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d63/a6b/1d5/d63a6b1d5fb64d61afc4888299a3c83d.png"><br><br>  Let's continue the conversation about children.  The price of such devices is rare when it exceeds 1000 rubles, so it‚Äôs not a pity to give them to a child!  Well, I broke or lost, okay, I punished myself.  Upset, will ask her again.  Buy a prefix again - there will be a new reason to rejoice, and the child himself may already be more careful about things, and if this does not help, then you can safely postpone the following gifts until better times. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2bc/9ac/24b/2bc9ac24b3574f989e72c22c77b14753.jpg"><br><br>  Built-in games and ease of use - the key chips of these devices. <br>  Why download or tune something?

AV-output and headphone output for something divided, probably so that during the game on the TV you can connect headphones, otherwise I won‚Äôt think of what it is there for. <br>  Wheel volume on the spot, the feeling that this is the best and most convenient, which could come up with developers for children. <br>  What we liked in this console is that if the touch screen is broken, then the child will still be able to play 133 button games.  The display size is 2.7 inches and the resolution is 320x240, as in the previous model. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d54/4bc/c47/d544bcc47d2a462f9aa7c02e47a17df1.png"><br><br>  The devices have proven themselves in travel, on vacation, in public places.

Included with the EXEQ RAINBOW is such a 3.5mm TRS - RCA cable (minijack - tulips).  This cable is not included with the EXEQ GURU kit, but it fits nicely from RAINBOW and works without problems.  Here it is, the length is 150 cm: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0dd/7f6/bab/0dd7f6bab3c04d59b0ff34a92b40d7b4.png"><br><br>  I connected the EXEQ TOY to the TV via the 2.5mm-3.5mm adapter like this, the issue price is 25 rubles: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2d9/ea1/bf5/2d9ea1bf58fd4cc982fc952baf97dbb5.png"><br><br>  EXEQ GURU <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/BIXjSx4A9Ho%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjbJsDtanO5-yMO0_iug59hhvnUvA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  EXEQ RAINBOW <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/0HdXKyHX-H4%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhh4E6WdBRTzmQkngiGCTfIJzD9xmQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  The picture on TV is displayed from all devices without problems, in TOY it switches to TV entirely, shutting down its own screen, and it saves batteries, in GURU and RAINBOW the picture is duplicated and remains on the set-top boxes themselves, if in the case of GURU this is justified due to positioning the stylus, then in RAINBOW simply provided a connector for connecting the power adapter. <br><br>  ‚ñå In conclusion. <br><br>  All consoles are powered by 3 AAA batteries (mizinchikovye batteries), have a video output and volume control wheel.  The battery life depends on the type of batteries, but in any case, the child uses the cheapest salt batteries, or you can pass an hour or so.  The volume takes the leading position TOY, then the GURU goes, despite its rear speaker and closes the RAINBOW with its front speaker (GURU and RAINBOW are difficult to distinguish by hearing the volume, here the larger frequency range of music plays a role).  On consoles there is a place for mounting a leash on the wrist. <br><br>  The inability to remain, in the case of EXEQ TOY, many players talked about the correctness of such a move, in the original console it was not possible to save progress, and most of the games run for a couple of hours, and sometimes even less.  In two other game consoles with sets of arcades and puzzles, this is not required at all, in principle, similar game consoles are designed for a quick game: turned on, played, turned off.  Flash games are usually beautiful, interesting, and they will take from a couple of minutes to an hour to complete. <br><br>  The lack of headphones can hardly be called a minus, these game consoles are designed mainly for children, and as practice shows, children often make the sound in the headphones louder than they should, and it can harm them.  We do not recommend buying headphones for children, but if there is a need for this, you should explain and show the child the volume needed for his ears. <br><br>  Batteries + or -?  In some cases, batteries are a plus, there are many cases where users require a battery compartment, and not a built-in battery, although there are plenty of battery opponents.  Anyway, battery boxes are cheaper and are more versatile when traveling or on vacation, when it is easier to buy batteries than to charge the built-in battery. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b19/6ab/50a/b196ab50ac8e4a2c2538d9bf39d13d93.png" alt="image">  <a href="http://www.exeq.ru/produkcija/pristavki/detskie.html">Official page on the manufacturer's website</a> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/949/d62/09b/949d6209b0a04223922c2faafd97e85c.png">  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist%3Flist%3DPLbbHbRwLL5zsfMbaKMoaOk1xp9rZwOuVs">Playlist with tests of games of game consoles on YouTube</a> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9d0/9e5/9e0/9d09e59e03c54ac5a024a44e58bfbdbb.png">  <a href="http://vk.com/app4300837_-38061543">Order with free shipping</a> <br><br>  <b>UPD</b> : At the request of workers added photos of disassembled consoles. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/363053/">https://habr.com/ru/post/363053/</a></p>
