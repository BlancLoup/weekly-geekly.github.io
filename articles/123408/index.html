      Of course, all of this is Hollywood fiction.  In fact, nothing like this happened.  But the phrase, and business cards, were more than real. <br><br>  Last year, David Kirpatrick in his book " <a href="http://www.facebook.com/thefacebookeffect">The Facebook Effect</a> " confirmed their existence.  Excerpt from the book: ‚ÄúAs soon as the guys from Facebook began to meet with real business professionals more often, their wild and unruly authority spread in the Valley.  ‚ÄúThe Lord of Flies is over there,‚Äù said one of the managers to a senior recruiter, pointing in the direction of Zuckerberg, who had to be careful about what business cards he took with him to the meetings.  He had two sets.  On one was a simple inscription: ‚ÄûCEO‚Äú.  On the other: ‚ÄûI'm the CEO ... bitch!‚Äú. ‚Äù <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  One of the first employees of the company - Andrew Bozworth (Andrew Bosworth - ‚ÄúBoz‚Äù), later continued this thought, answering the question <a href="http://www.quora.com/Facebook-Inc-company/Whats-the-story-behind-Mark-Zuckerbergs-fabled-Im-CEO%25E2%2580%25A6Bitch-business-card/answer/Andrew-Boz-Bosworth">in Quora</a> .  Let him try to get away from the fact of the existence of such business cards: "I think it was thought primarily as a joke on friends, and tells how insecure Mark himself was that one day he would become an important person in the entire industry." <br><br>  But more recently, Bryan Veloso, a Facebook designer from 2005 to 2006, gave a <a href="http://www.quora.com/Facebook-Inc-company/Whats-the-story-behind-Mark-Zuckerbergs-fabled-Im-CEO%25E2%2580%25A6Bitch-business-card/answer/Bryan-Veloso">detailed answer</a> to the same question in Quora.  In fact, he is the primary source, as the design of the business card was the creation of his hands.  According to Veloso, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe phrase ‚ÄúI'm a CEO, Bitch‚Äù came to him for a reason - Zuckerberg took full advantage of this turn.  And, according to his words, he did this in order to look more aggressive, simulating the behavior of one person: Steve Jobs. <br><br>  Here is the translation of the key part: ‚ÄúAs for Mark, it‚Äôs no secret that at one time he was guided in many ways by Steve Jobs.  Aaron Sittig and I were the only designers of the company at the end of 2005, all our meetings with Mark were held in this classic aggressive style of Jobs.  It was at one of these meetings that I remember how he used this phrase more than once. ‚Äù <br><br>  Veloso also notes that these business cards were in many ways a ‚Äúhappy coincidence‚Äù, because  he had a good relationship with Zuckerberg himself.  It is also said that by the end of his term on Facebook, they were no longer used: ‚ÄúFrom a designer‚Äôs point of view, these business cards that retired best illustrate the culture within the company at that time.  Their replacement symbolizes the changes that the young company had to go through in order to be where it is today. ‚Äù <br><br>  So this inscription on Mark Zuckerberg's business cards did not appear at all after a nightclub party with Victoria Secret models.  But they really were.  And for that you can thank Steve Jobs. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/uC5wVJrhzl0&amp;xid=17259,1500008,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhiX3bNmCsLxI-2ufWZm3jBnuMO6mg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  via <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/06/25/im-ceo-bitch/">TechCrunch</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/123408/">https://habr.com/ru/post/123408/</a></p>
