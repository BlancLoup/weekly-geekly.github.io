  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Link Building for Bing - Unlike Google and Important Nuances</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  SEO in the English segment is not just Google, especially if your potential customers live in the USA.  Despite the fact that in the world Google occupies more than 80% of the market, in the USA its share is about 65%. <br><br>  If you want to reach the hearts and wallets of citizens of the most solvent country in the world, you will have to learn how to optimize your website for other search engines. <br>  The second most popular overseas search service is Bing, with a market share of 33%.  And today we will talk about how to build link building for him. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  First you need to clarify for yourself 2 facts: <br><br><ol><li>  Ranging in different PS may differ.  For SEO specialists from the CIS countries, this is well known through the example of Yandex and Google.  In the case of Google and Bing, the story is similar.  You can easily get to the top 3 in Google, and in Bing is difficult to enter at 10. <br></li><li>  The second news is good.  The general laws of optimization for both search engines are similar, but there are nuances to be taken into account. </li></ol><br><h3>  Reference weight: VS quality grade </h3><br>  We all remember how to buy links "kilograms" and raised the issue in Google and Yandex.  But those times are irretrievably gone.

      Yes, Google still considers PageRank to be one of the main indicators of site quality (along with more than 200 other factors), but every year the volume of the link base loses its value, giving way to quality. <br><br>  Now for Yandex and Google it is much more important to see links from trust sites that are similar to your subject.  And for link spam, you can easily "get it in the neck." <br><br>  What do they think about this in Bing? <br><br>  The quality of links there is also evaluated, but in general, the link building rules are still closer to what used to be with Yandex and Google.  In Bing, you can achieve more by simply increasing the reference mass. <br><blockquote>  Important: both PS are trying to recognize the "junk" links.  Contact spam and make links with pages that are irrelevant to your content in any case is not worth it. </blockquote><h4>  How many links will be just right? </h4><br>  This is a sacred question, which, with 100% accuracy, may not be able to answer even within Google itself. <br><br>  To shed light on the problem, we present the data of one study conducted in the United States.  More than 600 SEO optimizers working in the US market asked a question: how many external links to the site do you make on average per month.  The results were as follows: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/sg/zb/i8/sgzbi88tyvih0krhrek6ryvllum.jpeg"><br><br><ul><li>  The vast majority - more than 70% - put from 1 to 20 links per month.  An indicator of about 20% can be considered optimal for promotion on Google. </li><li>  About 20% more behave more aggressively, making from 20 to 100 external links per month.  It is certain that nearly 100 new links should be alerted by Penguin Google.  But a score of just over 20 links will improve the ranking in Bing. </li></ul><br>  Forming the reference mass, consider the following: <br><br><ul><li>  Bing loyal to a lot of new links.  Google pays the most attention to link quality. </li><li>  In any case, both PS do not like cheap, purchased, temporary, etc.  links.  Pay attention to the donor‚Äôs trustworthiness and its relevance to your landing page. </li><li>  If you buy links on the exchanges, do not forget to check the donor sites with special services, such as SERPSTAT. </li><li>  Try to keep the amount of new links around 20 per month. </li><li>  For Bing, the age of the donor site is more important than for Google. </li><li>  Bing especially likes links from gov, .edu and .org domains. </li></ul><br><h3>  Anchor optimization </h3><br>  Anchor text is important for building the reference database.  Gogle and Yandex do not like when anchors of links are re-optimized.  In other words, if you use keywords as anchor all the time, Google and Yandex will punish you for it.  But Bing is a completely different story. <br>  Bing directly advises in his recommendations for webmasters to use target words in the ‚Äúanchors‚Äù of the links.  This distinction with Google is one of the key. <br><br>  As a result, you can increase the ranking in Bing, using the direct occurrences of requests in anchors, but the same action comes back to you in the Google issue. <br><br>  As you can see, it is necessary to look for a middle ground, and in this you, first of all, will help the analysis of competitors.  Examine those of them who were able to achieve good ranking in both search engines.  See how they use anchors. <br><br>  In any case, we recommend using a set of direct anchors, diluted and natural (bezankornyh) links. <br><br>  It is also important to pay attention to the textual text.  It should be relevant to your landing page. <br><br><h3>  Social networks </h3><br>  Using social networks to promote websites should be the main trend in the coming years. <br><br>  All major search engines (especially Google) are paying more attention to social activity.  The proliferation of neural networks and deep machine learning (on which Google makes maximum bets) will inevitably lead to the fact that behavioral factors will be central to the ranking of search results. <br><br>  How your content is shared on social networks is one of the most important markers of how useful your resource is to users.  And every year the weight of this factor will only grow. <br><br>  Bing assesses social activity.  In the recommendations for webmasters, he directly talks about this. <br><br>  Google, on the contrary, considers this ranking method as abolished. <br><br><h4>  So how to interact with social media? </h4><br>  First, let's look at the results of a survey of the most influential SEO specialists in the United States. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/dn/kp/vi/dnkpviftafrl0_0huy2i9t-7dnk.jpeg"><br><br>  Almost 70% of them believe that the use of social activity brings a real result. <br><br><ul><li>  88% posted links to sites on social networks. </li><li>  81% shared content on a social media site. </li><li>  53% of advanced SEO specialists created viral advertising campaigns, in particular, conducted polls and contests. </li></ul><br>  In addition, we recommend: <br><br><ul><li>  attract ‚Äúopinion leaders‚Äù - find people who are reputable in topics relevant to your site, and try to provide them with quality content for placing it on your page (naturally, with a link to your site); </li><li>  make a quality video (it‚Äôs important that it be placed on your website, not on YouTube), and then ask people to share this video on social networks; </li><li>  look for sites for content and links with special services. </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ze/mc/5j/zemc5jpbo_scogvdukrxuxcz-m0.jpeg"><br><br><h3>  Conclusion: find a middle ground </h3><br>  As you can see, it is easier to get ahead in Bing using the reference base than in Google.  He is much more loyal to a sharp increase in the reference mass. <br><br>  You can still go up to issue Bing by purchasing a large number of more or less quality links.  However, such actions will lead to problems with ranking in Google. <br>  We strongly recommend that you find a middle ground.  In addition, do not forget that the most effective way to promote in modern search engines is to create high-quality content that will most clearly respond to the requests of visitors.  The same is said in the Bing recommendations. <br><br>  Before you start promotion in Bing, be sure to set yourself a webmaster Bing.  Instructions for installing it (in Russian) and its capabilities can be found on the Internet. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/352172/">https://habr.com/ru/post/352172/</a></p>
