  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Hard to be first</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The first thing we do when we have a question is - we turn to the Internet.  It has everything and more.  And the situation, when something cannot be found, causes, if not irritation, then bewilderment - that's for sure.  It seems that if something is not on the Web, then it does not exist at all.  The site address today is a document that most reliably all other documents confirm that this organization or person is quite real.  Here is such a paradox of our time, when your existence in the virtual world makes you much more real and noticeable to many. <br><br>  But there is another problem faced by everyone who wants to get into this virtual real world: some resources are needed.  And everyone solves this problem for themselves in different ways.  With different companies and organizations, and even private individuals, everything is clear: there is money and time, everything is simple and clear.  And what is it necessary for those who are in the Internet space to be necessary, and, as a rule, there is no money for it? <br><br>  Very often, these are those on whom our future directly depends - people who are engaged in our children, their education and development.  Unfortunately, in practice we are faced with a situation where teachers are faced with the fact of having to have their own web resource, but they do not know where to start or how to do it.

      Understanding the importance of the process of integrating modern information technologies in the field of education, the company Masterhost was one of the first in Russia who began to take steps to remedy the current situation and offered free hosting to educational institutions and individuals creating and supporting non-commercial projects on education and upbringing.  For many years, the program for the provision of educational services has been maintained and updated for these purposes. <br><br>  Since the launch of this program, free hosting has been used by over 800 projects.  We have gained extensive experience with educational projects, and therefore the procedure for providing free hosting does not take much time.  I would also like to note that the view that free means bad is wrong in the case of the ‚ÄúEducational‚Äù tariff, since  You get full hosting with 1000 MB of disk space, unlimited traffic, round-the-clock support and backup.  In general, everything that is called ‚Äúprofessional hosting‚Äù is free of charge. <br><br>  Therefore, our dear teachers, teachers - all those who invest their strength, time and talent in the upbringing and education of the younger generation - go ahead!  Masterhost is always ready to help you with this! <a name="habracut"></a></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/178371/">https://habr.com/ru/post/178371/</a></p>
