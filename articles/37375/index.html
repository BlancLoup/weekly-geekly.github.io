  <section class="page js-page"><h1>My plans for a new account. year</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Greetings to all! <br>  This is my topic is a logical continuation of the two previous dedicated to the problems of IT education. <br>  <a href="http://maxh0.habrahabr.ru/blog/26526/">maxh0.habrahabr.ru/blog/26526</a> <br>  <a href="http://maxh0.habrahabr.ru/blog/26592/">maxh0.habrahabr.ru/blog/26592</a> <br>  Now I will try to describe the situation in which I am and my plans for the future. <a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>So, the introductory part.</b> <br>  I am the head (relatively recently, since January of this year) of the Laboratory of Informatics and Information Technologies of the provincial center for scientific and technical creativity.  I supervise the activities of a number of circles located in schools, as well as in our Center.  It is supervised.  Teachers directly depend only on their director, as well as on the director of our Center, but, most importantly, on social order.  It depends on whether they gather in their circle of children or not.  And there is a social order for information technology.  It is so big that under this pretext you can sniff anything.  But I think that if you teach, you need to learn correctly.  Therefore, I appeal to you for help and advice. <br>  So <b>my plans.</b> <br>  In the department to which my laboratory belongs, the learning process is divided into blocks of 3 months (2 pairs 2 times a week = 48 training hours).  Classes are conducted in groups of 12-15 people.  2-3 people in a group go on an individual creative route.  They make reports, speeches, and then creative works. <br>  Based on my own ideas, I formed the following blocks. <br>  9 cl.  (1 year of study) <br>  1. Windows operating system <br>  2. HTML / xHTML <br>  3. Java script / Ajax <br>  10 cl.  (2 year of study - according to 2009 academic year) <br>  1. Linux operating system <br>  2./3.  PHP + MySQL (In principle, I foresee objections, I myself would prefer what Python would be, but firstly, I don‚Äôt know it well, secondly, you can buy a book on PHP + MySQL at every corner, and thirdly, if the site moves for the limits of the school lab, the hosting is easier to find for PHP + MySQL zy. If you fix it and help, I will be glad.) <br>  In parallel, in another group is programming in Pascal + Algorithms.  (We have been giving Pascal for a number of years already, but this year we went to the Russian competitions and took almost the last place). <br>  Second year (C / C ++) and review of other programming languages ‚Äã‚Äã/ paradigms. <br>  In addition, it is planned to give in-depth school informatics, because with this a complete blockage. <br>  Grade 11 is purposefully preparing for admission to university.  Here on programming there are only going on an individual creative route. <br>  In addition, we recommend parents to take the entire following block of subjects: Computer Science (I mean one of the above areas) + Mathematics + English.  This, of course, only in our Center, in schools in circles give everyone - who is in that much. <br>  <b>What has been done.</b> <br>  Few.  Very little.  A lot of time is spent on current work.  Time for self-preparation is sorely lacking. <br>  The Windows course HTML / xHTML is more or less planned out. <br>  The Java-script / Ajax course is in its infancy - I lack experience and good literature.  (Your opinion - what should include 24 (or 12) lessons on Java-script / Ajax?) <br>  I have begun work on the integration of our Center with the Linux community - the opening of the Linux Mandriva Competence Center is planned.  In general, that's all. <br>  <b>For what I address to Habr - to community.</b> <br>  First of all - for advice.  I am not a professional and I can not be a professional in IT.  My task is different - to give knowledge.  Simple, affordable, right.  I hope you will not refuse to share them with me. <br>  Secondly, for moral support.  The funny thing is that if I give up all this, and I sit on the priest exactly, without creating unnecessary movements, it will be more likely appreciated. <br>  And in the third - I'm just wondering - what am I standing for. <br>  Thank you all in advance! <br>  ADDITION after reading a number of comments: It is about ADDITIONAL (circle) education.  This is not a secondary school education. <br>  <b>Comment from 08/31/08</b> <br>  Life has made adjustments.  The main focus of this year is Programming.  On the Web - significantly less than in the past.  Most likely because of the weak study of the courses. <br>  Programming - children ask for Python.  He is even on their cell.  These are the pies. <br>  Life is an interesting thing.  I will try to match her. :) </div>
