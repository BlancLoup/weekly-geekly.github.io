  <section class="page js-page"><h1>My time is priceless</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Like many readers, having read the article <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/my_business/88775/">‚Äú100 dollars per hour‚Äù</a> , I could not pass by and wrote the answer.  My answer will be in the form of an article, I will not build my article according to the principle ‚Äúand here I am - and here it is‚Äù, I‚Äôll just tell you about what I do, what surrounds me and what my time, my life consists of. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  I wake up in the morning ... </h4><br>  Every morning I get up and make coffee and breakfast, I don‚Äôt go to the nearest cafe, I like to drink coffee even in bed, I like to smell the light smell of vegetables, mushrooms and onions, which I carefully peel and after 5 minutes they will be in wonderful fried eggs with onions and mushrooms.  And now my eyes are already sparkling over the fried eggs and this breakfast gives me a charge of cheerfulness and starts my day.  I like the process and the food, this feeling is not bought or sold. <br><br><h4>  Every day I go to ... </h4><br>  Every day I go to work, I go to work on foot.  My path passes through a small section in a residential neighborhood, two bridges and a park along the river. <br>  I pass by fishermen who stand on the shore and try to catch a fish, and that's someone lucky and he pulls the fish, involuntarily, this process captures everyone who is watching.  ‚Äú- Man, give me a landing net?‚Äù And now I'm already a participant in fishing, normal real fishing, I stopped for 2 minutes, the man pulled out a pike and I got my mood boost.  Although I just go to work. <br>  Sometimes, in the summer, after the rain, all the foliage in this park seems to clap on the shoulder with its greenery, snails crawl around and begin their marvelous journeys through the wet soil and trees, everything moves and lives around, every breath of air convinces me that nothing went through the park risking dirtying in fresh puddles.  Can I buy these snails and puddles?  :) Whether I became richer from this walk - certainly, if I had more money - I think not.  Although I just go to work. <br><br>  Winter.  It seems that walking on frozen paths covered with snow does not bring pleasure, every step spends 3 times more effort than in summer, but every step leaves behind a pleasant creak of snow in the air, this is not the starch creak - it's all real.  With each step, the frosty air gives a charge of vivacity.  Here is a cubbyte rolling with the sleds of the children, from the ringing laughter brings back memories of his own childhood - snowballs, skis, sleds ... This winter, the tracks, sleds, snow and memories carry me far back to childhood.  Each step proves to itself that I am not just a biorobot with quantitative and qualitative characteristics, I am part of this world.

      Once, I went to work as usual, the water in the canal was frozen and I did not climb the bridge but walked on the ice, I suddenly heard a loud crying on the bridge, a young girl was standing on the very edge and crying, the most logical decision was to call rescuers I don‚Äôt know her fate, but that day she didn‚Äôt jump from the bridge, I hope that my act gave her more time to think that everyone would probably do it, but that time there was just me and the crowd of hurrying people in cars to the bridge.  Whether this situation is measured by money somehow - I think not. <br>  On average, I spend about 30-40 minutes on the road and I can‚Äôt say that I‚Äôve been wasting it. <br><br><h4>  Work </h4><br>  After a wonderful breakfast and a walk, I come to work, I try to find wonderful moments in every moment - so we created a wonderful, working project, so when solving a specific task, we found an original engineering solution, so we managed ahead of time, but we made a mistake , but she taught us a lot and brought more experience than the previous month without errors. <br>  Every day I do different jobs, with different degrees of interest in her, but in any case, I try to find more than the money I earn.  And I like the things that I do. <br><br><h4>  Good evening </h4><br>  And feeling pleasantly tired from daytime activities, I return home, also on foot, the evening sky is studded with stars, the light of the lanterns pervades the parks, painting the shops with a yellowish tinge, the couple in love tenderly holding hands, drowning in the depths of the park, perhaps with their favorite four hands we will cook a delicious dinner, cultivating culinary fantasies, perhaps we will go somewhere to friends or friends will come to us, maybe we will go aimlessly to wander around the evening city or in a cozy restaurant by the light of a low hanging lamp divides  I have impressions about the day.  And in the evening I do not want to become attached to money, I get emotions, sensations, vigor, joy - without money, just like that, because it is part of my life. <br><br>  This is how my story comes to an end, I could still tell a lot about the people around me (thanks to everyone :)), about the journeys to which I manage to escape, about the places I was able to visit, about what I did with my hands, but I will round out.  Does my story mean that I don‚Äôt count money - no, it doesn‚Äôt mean, with my story I wanted to say that I don‚Äôt measure my life with money and that makes me freer. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/88897/">https://habr.com/ru/post/88897/</a></p>
