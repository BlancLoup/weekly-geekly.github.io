But in HP, too, not fools are sitting and doing everything to stimulate the server economy update - the drivers for the new OS are not being developed, the completion of the firmware has ceased, so you have to drive yourself to the paradise and willy-nilly, but you have to update. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  But we also have our own interest.  To use old equipment, on the tasks that he can afford, is our first duty, especially since there are free licenses for Windows 2008 R2.  Let's try to pull an owl called Windows 2008 R2 on our old DL360 G4p globe (P54). <br><br><h3>  Koloboks are investigating </h3><br>  In the lists of supported systems on the server page DL360G4, OS Windows 2008 R2 is no longer listed.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/92f/62b/10c/92f62b10caaa48d2b577837cd8caa33b.png"><br><br>  If we look in the support matrix, <br>  <a href="http://h17007.www1.hp.com/us/en/enterprise/servers/supportmatrix/windows.aspx">h17007.www1.hp.com/us/en/enterprise/servers/supportmatrix/windows.aspx#.Vufcl-KLTcs</a> <br>  then officially W2K8 R2 is supported only for generations G7 and fresher.  There is no talk about G4. <br>  And yet, if you go to the BIOS page for G4p, you will see the following: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f80/69e/d40/f8069ed4074a486183fedf28f7b23ba1.png"><br><br>  Those.  A BIOS for G4p (P54) (sp30408.exe) that supports the W2K8 installation exists, but is ‚Äúlocked up‚Äù and is available only if you have a maintenance contract. <br><br>  Before starting work should: <br>  1. Go through the server with the latest available Firmware CD for this model or slip it into the dark HP Smart Update Manager and lift the last eyelid. <br>  2. Purchase a system maintenance contract and legally obtain the latest BIOS version for G4p, download and install BIOS 2007.07.16A. <br>  3. Upgrade iLO2 to version 1.92. <br><br><h3>  Mysterious artifacts and special ancient magic </h3><br>  If your server is equipped with an FDD drive, then before inserting floppy disks into it, the drive must be removed and blown with compressed air from dust.  The design of the server is such that a large volume of air is pumped through a disk drive and a CD drive by fans and all the dust accumulates inside the devices.  If the drives are used extremely rarely, then the dust deposits work like a good sandpaper. <br><br>  It is better to deploy updates on a USB flash drive, but when using HP standard tools, a flash drive is required that is NOT MORE THAN 2GB in size! <br><br>  The installation of the W2K8 was done by my colleague, and, according to him, there were no problems there. <br><br><h3>  Crossing the grass with the hedgehog or the horse of Tuguez </h3><br>  But with the union of adapters in the team (team) had to tinker a bit.  The server is equipped with two built-in network adapters NC7782, assembled on a Broadcom BCM5704CFKB chip, which are interesting to unite in a team. <br><br>  Traditionally, the team is going with the help of HP NCU - ‚Äã‚ÄãNetwork Configuration Utility.  NCU is a separate product, and its version under W2k8 is available on the HP website and is available for download without restrictions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/865/e0d/9eb/865e0d9eb42a480ca757f86efcdd1121.png"><br><br>  The Version 10.50.0.0 utility on the server got up, but did not see a single network adapter NC7782.  The latest version 10.90.0.0 and at all issued here is an interesting message: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ed3/9d0/4d3/ed39d04d3c054124820acf1f0d0aa3d9.png"><br><br>  What should be understood as ‚Äúthe software has been installed somehow, but how-it is not clear and doing this is definitely not worth it.‚Äù <br><br>  And what about our drivers?  And we got drivers for network cards when installing W2K8.  It has been suggested that NCUs require drivers from HP. <br><br>  And where to get the drivers, taking into account that formally they are no longer doing them for 2008 R2 for G4p?  ‚ÄúYes, here they are!  <s>Put</s> "it doesn't matter that they are under Windows 2003 x64. <br><br>  cp006193.exe <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/264/a24/3a6/264a243a6bbc40e79e857819e826ddb8.png"><br><br>  Of course, according to the traditional scheme, they will not rise.  cp006193.EXE, when launched, reports that ‚Äúthe grenades are not of the same system,‚Äù and they cannot work here because they do not want. <br><br>  But manually set.  cp006193.EXE is a self-extracting archive that is normally deployed using Winrar.  We decompose it into a separate directory and then "System / Device Manager / Network cards / Driver / Update ... / Install manually / show on the directory.  The driver changes on the fly, even the terminal session is not interrupted.  "2003 x64 on 2008 R2" <br><br>  But this did not help, the NCU did not see its own drivers.  Perhaps an understatement of the NCU version would help, but it was decided to try another solution. <br><br><h3>  And what about u ....? </h3><br>  Other server manufacturers, such as Dell and Fujitsu, use software developed by Broadcom under the name BACS (Broadcom Advanced Control Suite) for teaming.  Version 4 is currently available. <br><br>  HP has one too.  cp022114.exe <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d21/fd1/72b/d21fd172b2964ab2998a23fefcae9e03.png"><br><br>  But HP sees its use somewhat differently - the organization of iSCSI and FCOE targets on the platforms we require.  BACS for HP on G4 refused to start, ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù he says ‚Äî you have the right hardware for me. ‚Äù  Yes, and not really wanted. <br><br>  Where BACS4 is downloaded from the Broadcom website I never found, a link to management applications leads to page 404. Broadcom writes that the package comes on a CD along with the network cards of the vendors.  The entire package is posted on the Fujitsu website: <br><br>  <a href="http://support.ts.fujitsu.com/Download/ShowDescription.asp%3FSoftwareGUID%3D31239D24-69B5-43EB-9C50-C3AA36F1AE80%26Info%3DFTS">support.ts.fujitsu.com/Download/ShowDescription.asp?SoftwareGUID=31239D24-69B5-43EB-9C50-C3AA36F1AE80&amp;Info=FTS</a> <br><br>  Or you can search the Internet for the file FTS_BroadcomAdvancedControlSuite4BACS_14831_1064191.zip. <br>  2011, but it works. <br><br>  Getting started installing BACS4. <br><br><h2>  ‚ÄúHP is not HP, the Subscriber is not a subscriber‚Äù </h2><br>  - BACS4 does not deal with such nonsense.  He doesn‚Äôt care: ‚ÄúFujitsu is not Fujitsu‚Äù <br><br>  Then everything is just ‚ÄúCommands / Create‚Äù.  Call Team1.  Add both available adapters.  (Physically, at the time of assembling the tim, to avoid problems, only one cable is connected to the network. After assembling the tim, connect the second cable and everything works as usual) <br><br>  If he doesn't like the drivers, BACS4 will tell about it.  On HP drivers, he cursed and said: ‚ÄúI want NDIS6, NDIS5 - I do not want!‚Äù <br><br>  On the Broadcom website, we took the latest drivers for BCM5704 (Version 17.2.0.2 of July 03, 2015) and installed them on G4. <br>  This is what the BACS4 interface looks like. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/631/f67/198/631f67198ab4428c8a7e7545e4027325.png"><br><br>  The server is connected to the HP Procurve 2910, so when you install, you must specify 802.3 ad, another protocol of the ports Procurve is not understood (from the switch on the ports assembled LACP). <br><br>  Everything Works, the flight is normal. <br>  About NIC teaming, White paper from HP.  Useful reading. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.hp.com/sbso/bus_protect/teaming.pdf">www.hp.com/sbso/bus_protect/teaming.pdf</a> <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/279395/">https://habr.com/ru/post/279395/</a></p>
