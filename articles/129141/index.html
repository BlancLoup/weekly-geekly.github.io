  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Luxoft Personnel presents the results of a study of the labor market of IT specialists in Russia and Ukraine (June-September 2011)</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <i>The review provides analytical information <b>on the dynamics of the labor market of</b> highly qualified IT specialists, indicates the <b>ratio of supply and demand in the IT</b> labor <b>market</b> , lists the most demanded IT specializations in 2011, and shows the salary expectations of IT specialists in June-September 2011. Also presented main <b>trends in the development</b> of the labor market of IT specialists in 2011.</i> <br><br>  <b>Labor market and the dynamics of salary expectations of IT-specialists in Russia and Ukraine in June-September 2011</b> <br><br>  As the <a href="http://www.luxoft-personnel.ru/labor_market/2_2011/">research results</a> show, the dynamics of salary expectations of Russian IT specialists in 2011 correspond to the traditional behavior of the labor market.  After the summer lull, starting from August-September, both lower and upper boundaries of expectations grow.  It should be noted that, on average, salary expectations of representatives of the most sought-after specializations ‚Äî Java and Oracle developers, iOS and Android mobile applications, highly qualified QA engineers and analysts ‚Äî increased by 15‚Äì20%.  Describing the situation in the IT labor market in Ukraine, the <a href="http://www.luxoft-personnel.ru/">recruitment agency</a> Luxoft Personnel notes that the shortage of highly qualified specialists and, as a result, the competition of IT companies for candidates led to the fact that by mid-September the growth of salary expectations, which had been steadily growing year, averaged 15-20%.

If young specialists and middle-level specialists indicate a fixed amount, then highly qualified specialists can lower their expectations regarding a fixed amount of remuneration, but at the same time they will rely on a high level of total income due to bonus schemes and additional social options.  package. <br><br>  Today, Russian companies are ready to offer not only attractive social conditions.  package, but also internship programs for young professionals in order to ‚Äúgrow‚Äù a professional inside.  A good example is the intensification of such programs in spring 2011, which slightly smoothed the lack of qualified specialists.  For the same reason, companies retain the desire to retain existing qualified employees, at the same time, warming up the market with the willingness to pay more to hire "stars." <br><br>  The labor market in Ukraine is characterized by an active redistribution of highly qualified personnel between companies that ‚Äúhunt‚Äù mainly for highly qualified IT <a href="http://www.luxoft-personnel.ru/slovar/1264/">specialists</a> .  But yesterday‚Äôs students and mid-level professionals find a suitable job a little more difficult.  There is also a clear tendency to retain staff, many companies are willing to bring the salary of a key employee in line with the average salary expectations in the labor market, which tend to be higher than the average for the company. <br><br>  For most applicants both in Russia and in Ukraine, the most important criterion when choosing a job is still high wages.  At the same time, in conditions of high competition, non-material <a href="http://www.luxoft-personnel.ru/articles/motivation_in_it/">motivation</a> significantly influences the choice of candidates: vocational training at the company's expense, overseas business trips, and attractive soc.  package.  Such factors as the company's reputation in the labor market, a comfortable pace and content of work, the ability to work on a free schedule or remotely come to the forefront for candidates. <br><br>  <b>Supply and demand in the labor market of highly qualified IT-specialists in Moscow and Kiev</b> <br><br>  The general situation on the Moscow labor market in the second half of 2011 (June-early September 2011) can be characterized by a steady increase in the number of vacancies with a slight traditional decline in the summer period.  The number of <a href="http://www.luxoft-personnel.ru/cv/send_resume.html">resumes of</a> young specialists remains high, but due to the activation of internship and training programs, the difference in the number of vacancies for young professionals with the number of resumes does not exceed 10‚Äì15% on average. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/63c88927/8e3f2084/5d166cc0/9610379b.jpg"><br><br>  The conducted research has shown that the labor market is filled mainly with young specialists and middle-level specialists.  Highly qualified candidates, as a rule, quickly find a job that satisfies high demands regarding wages and career prospects.  In general, the second half of 2011 is characterized by the fact that the number of candidates entering the market in search of work still exceeds the number of vacancies posted.  At the same time, experts note that the behavior of players in the labor market has slightly changed.  Large companies focus their efforts on searching for ‚Äústars‚Äù; now they are looking not just for ordinary highly qualified specialists, but for high-level managers and proactive professionals who are ready to develop new projects. <br><br>  In Kiev, the number of vacancies exceeds the number of resumes of highly qualified specialists by almost 1.5 times.  As a rule, these are vacancies for high-level specialists with good work experience.  At the same time, there is a significant demand for specialists with knowledge of the English language, who can claim a higher (within 10-15%) salary.  High competition of companies leads to the fact that the labor market is ‚Äúoverheated‚Äù.  In an effort to outbid the best specialist from a competitor, organizations have created the ground for unjustified inflation of candidates' salary expectations.  The number of vacancies is growing at a faster pace than the market is filled with candidates, in connection with which in the near future competition will only increase. <br><br>  <b>The most popular IT-specialists in 2011</b> <b><br></b> <br><br>  According to the results of the analysis conducted, the trends of the second half of 2011 (June - early September 2011) do not bring significant changes in the demand for IT specialists. <br><br>  The most sought-after for Russia are technical specialists - developers, fluent in various programming languages.  The most popular are still Java developers.  Next in popularity are Oracle and .NET developers, respectively.  In third place are mobile application development experts (Android, iOs developers). <br><br>  The number of <a href="http://www.luxoft-personnel.ru/job/">vacancies</a> for IT-sales and Help Desk specialists is at the same level (5% for Sales, 10% for HD), consultants for the implementation and maintenance of ERP systems account for a smaller percentage of vacancies - 6%.  The demand for managers is gradually increasing: CIOs, IT-directors, their deputies, heads of IT-departments and other managers of the industry.  The number of vacancies for IT analysts and testers remains stable, the market offers them about 15% of vacancies. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/ae601110/13633126/5efb690f/8951696a.jpg"><br><br>  For Ukraine, a somewhat different distribution of <a href="http://www.luxoft-personnel.ru/job/city/kiev/">vacancies is</a> characteristic.  As well as in Russia, software developers are popular, they account for more than a third of the market, primarily java-specialists, developers of C ++, .NET, PHP, mobile platforms.  In second place in popularity - software testing specialists.  About 10% of vacancies fall on the share of managerial positions - Program and Project managers, group leaders.  Approximately 15% of vacancies open to Functional and Business analysts, 6 and 7% respectively - vacancies for IT-sales and ERP implementation specialists, and about 10% of vacancies are open to specialists in the accompanying areas - Help Desk and system administrators, database administrators. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.luxoft-personnel.ru/">The recruitment agency</a> Luxoft Personnel concludes that today the situation in the IT labor market is such that more and more companies are striving to grow qualified personnel within the enterprise.  However, the continuing shortage of highly qualified professionals leads to the fact that many are ready to poach employees from competing companies, exacerbating the already high competition. <br><br>  More: <a href="http://www.luxoft-personnel.ru/labor_market/2_2011/">download pdf file</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/129141/">https://habr.com/ru/post/129141/</a></p>
