The device was first brought to light in January, but then it was a presentation for the Japanese market.  Today, the company officially announced the release of the tablet on world markets, including Russia. <br><br>  The 10.1-inch tablet is an independent development of Sony Mobile, a relative of Xperia smartphones - unlike the previous tablets developed by Sony Electronics and being closer to Vaio laptops.

      In principle, those who closely monitor the market for tablets, already aware of the characteristics according to the Japanese premiere.  I wrote about him and <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/169979/">on Habr√©</a> .  However, today for the first time I can talk about him in more detail, as well as answer some related questions. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/495/752/122/495752122f16da4b2babb55de035ebcc.png"><br><br><h4>  Specifications </h4><br>  To be precise, the Sony Xperia Tablet Z is the sibling of the Sony Xperia Z, as the name clearly indicates, and has almost identical fillings - adjusted for the form factor, of course. <br><br>  <b>Processor:</b> Quad-core Snapdragon APQ8064 1.5 GHz <br>  <b>Display:</b> 10.1 "1920x1200 resolution, 224 ppi <br>  <b>OS:</b> Android 4.1 <br>  <b>Memory:</b> 16 or 32 GB, 2 GB RAM, support for microSD memory cards up to 32 GB <br>  <b>Battery:</b> 6000 mAh <br>  <b>Weight and dimensions:</b> 495 g, body thickness - 6.9 mm <br>  <b>Wireless protocols:</b> NFC, LTE <br>  <b>Camera:</b> 8 MP main and 2 MP front <br>  <b>Protection:</b> against water and dust according to IP 55/57 <br><br><h4>  Appearance and Erogomics </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/efc/390/65b/efc39065be2bfe688c840977e8c409ae.png"><br><br>  The first thing you notice when you take it in hand is easier than you would expect.  In the pocket and on the weight of each hundred grams becomes redundant, so the weight less than half a kilogram is recorded in the unambiguous Tablet Z asset. Immediately after the weight you pay attention to how thin it is - 6.9 mm from the display to the back cover. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/50f/82e/1e6/50f82e1e61cb314a14bd0710debec692.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e4f/e97/4ad/e4fe974ad52384adb981d5020c9253a2.png"><br><br>  The back cover, by the way, is made of velvety soft-touch plastic - in contrast to the glass surface of Xperia Z. It must be assumed that this is hello and more shock-resistant, and one of the reasons for the lightness of the entire device.  Along the perimeter of the body is edged with fiberglass to the color of the body - that is, black or white.  Lilac, like Xperia Z, the tablet will not): <br>  Along the perimeter there are connectors: a combined HDMI + MicroUSB MHL port, a 3.5 mm audio jack, connectors for MicroSD and SIM cards. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/108/470/8b6/1084708b64ef2fd8bc142a93ba5432dc.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/db8/b29/8de/db8b298dea4c399ce75dde7ce8d47108.png"><br><br>  All - closed with plugs, this is the price of water resistance.  But you can dive into the bathroom with Tablet Z and your favorite TV show - and there will be more than just a tablet under water more than your windshield (: <br><br>  I already wrote once that the wide experience in the release of protected Sony smartphones was not in vain - with each new generation, the protection remains all the same reliable, but it becomes less and less noticeable, and the devices take on a more civil look.  Tablet Z is not an exception, it is impossible to guess that it is not afraid of water jets or immersion by sight, and the plugs are very compact, elegant and open / close easily. <br><br>  The corners are located speakers.  Do not let their appearance mislead you - on this side the tablet is also reliably protected. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ba2/83d/90b/ba283d90b837be239b57f2a99e2aced3.png"><br><br>  The infrared port is still located on the upper end - after setting the Tablet Z, you can use it as a remote control, and on the side end there is also a volume rocker. <br><br>  Another important ergonomic moment is that the layout of the music player and camera launch buttons on the lock screen is adjusted so precisely that the thumbs literally fall on them.  Their move is also optimal - a short movement with your thumb, and you have a camera or player running. <br><br><h4>  Speed ‚Äã‚Äãperformance </h4><br>  A wide-spread video from the Japanese presentation Xperia Tablet Z caused lively holivary due to slowdowns in the interface when scrolling through the pages.  Since the argument about far from final software did not convince everyone, I recorded a short video in the Sony Mobile office, which shows the tablet in action.  Despite the fact that the firmware is still not final in this case, the situation has clearly become better - pay attention not only to the speed of the interface‚Äôs reaction, but also to the speed of the camera launch: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/rBGIr5q0MFc&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256&amp;usg=ALkJrhgJPkfXi-4rQMAcLn_ulrckdxMloA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h4>  Package and delivery </h4><br>  On sale, we expect the appearance of the Xperia Tablet Z in the second quarter of this year.  The choice of buyers will be available: <br><br><ul><li>  Wi-Fi or LTE version, </li><li>  Black or white hull colors </li><li>  16 or 32 GB of internal memory. </li></ul><br>  On board, the Tablet Z is Android 4.1, which is expected to be updated to version 4.2 in the third quarter.  Prices will be announced later. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/979/e05/cda/979e05cda251abb9182147cff5d63e6d.png"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/170415/">https://habr.com/ru/post/170415/</a></p>
