  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Pirates: to be or not to be</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Brought to you by The Pirate Bay. <br><br>  Now more and more often from owners of rights threats in the direction of torrent trackers in particular and pirates in general are heard.  Their position is clear: they lose profits.  On the one hand, users are good, they need to spend less money, on the other hand, they get a lower-quality product, but many people do not care about that.  But my subjective opinion. <br><br>  I'll start with the products of Microsoft, namely, Microsoft Office.  Of the entire office suite, I actively use Word, Excel, Outlook, and sometimes OneNote and PowerPoint.  But!  Show me the editors of MS Offic, where there are only these products.  There is no such thing, but I don‚Äôt want to overpay for products that I don‚Äôt need.  What prevents Microsoft from allowing users to choose what they need, not what they impose?  So it turns out, that is, desire, but there is no opportunity to buy the right software. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Next come the game.  Honestly, I do not understand people who use pirated versions.  The only advantage is that they are much cheaper.  But is the money saved on launching such games worth the time and nerves worth it?  I think not.  You need to install several applications, run them in a certain order, and only then, if everything goes well, you can enjoy the game.  Again, if it does not take off every 15-30 minutes due to the next crack.  Games are fun, and for him, as you know, you have to pay.  Only, for some reason, few people understand this.

      Music and movies.  With this category of products, everything is much worse.  The quality of even licensed discs often leaves much to be desired, printing also does not please the eye.  I'm not talking about the fact that some discs / movies are simply impossible to buy.  For example, the disc was released in 1998, and it is not republished, but I want to listen to my favorite artist.  After all, you can, for example, republish discs every five years in small editions.  Why does no one do this?  Publishers are afraid that no one will buy, but at the same time they resent the torrent trackers, where you can almost always find the right drive.  I do not understand this. <br><br>  What do we get in the end?  Consumers simply can not buy everything they need because of the same rightholders.  And also ... More mp3 music collections with a beautiful holographic sticker - a license!  Yes, I do not need such a license!  I want to be able to buy what I want, but not what they offer!  Do it first so that there is an opportunity to use legal products, and then fight the pirates! .. <br><br>  The original is <a href="http://blog.e0ne.info/post/Pirats-to-be-or-not-to-be.aspx">here</a> . <br><br>  PS I wanted to write to the blog "Copyright", but there is no karma. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/58160/">https://habr.com/ru/post/58160/</a></p>
