  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Internship programs or the course of a young fighter</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The article was inspired by the article " <a href="http://shakhr.habrahabr.ru/blog/79451/">I have half of the students - future programmers. But they still don‚Äôt know how to program and don‚Äôt learn. They will be taught at the institute :)</a> " <br><br>  In my experience, there are of course nuggets (units) that learn programming languages, technologies are still at school, at the institute.  But more often it happens that you really have to study when you start work as an intern, assistant, etc.  And then you have to quickly, already on real projects and living problems, remember what was taught in school and institute. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  But it is good when certain skills and technologies can be learned at the institute according to a given curriculum.  And if some technologies are specific enough and they are not taught in any institute.  For example, I was engaged in SAP at one time.  I do not know the educational institutions in which the relevant personnel are trained.  Training materials and courses are not freely available.  At least officially.  Not officially - who wants to - he will find :) But again, without a correctly configured system, reading books is pointless.  It is like reading the classics of programming in six months, but without turning on the computer in order to consolidate the knowledge gained and, without checking your own theories that have arisen in the process of reading, say that you have become a guru.

      The company in which I was working at the time organized internship programs for which people were recruited who knew almost nothing about the SAP, but after the training they came out completely knowledgeable in theory.  And after immersing in a practical project, they quickly became good consultants.  But at the same time rarely anyone lingered in this company.  They were lured to other companies that did not invest in training, but received trained specialists at someone else‚Äôs expense.  :( It is impossible to hold people under current legislation, training is at the expense of the employer. A cheap weekly refresher course in SAP costs about 1,200‚Äì1,500 euros. What about two months training? <br><br>  A similar situation was with the introduction of SAP at the Automobile Plant LLC KAMAZ.  It was necessary to train local staff to work with SAP, and not only warehouse operators, but also IT services, who would have to accompany the system after we left there.  Despite the fact that the newly baked sappers had nowhere to move from such a narrow specialization - in Naberezhnye Chelny only SAP worked with Severstal with the production of SsangYong cars, and in the neighboring Nizhnekamsk there are enterprises of the chemical industry which use SAP, which would have to carry water in a colander management had  There was a sad experience of implementing BAAN several years ago, when specialists trained with KAMAZ money left for the capital for much higher salaries.  But the sudden crisis helped to keep specialists from seeking happiness in distant lands, moreover, they even managed to get very good specialists from Togliatti with GM-Avtovaz. <br><br>  In our capitals, it is much easier for an SAP consultant in this sense to change employers, because  There are a large number of companies (it is clear that with different conditions and reputation) who are ready to take advantage of his knowledge, experience and connections. <br><br>  So the whole is a disappointing picture.  I think that few managers will want to train young people without a guarantee that the investment will pay off.  Practically every company wants to get an already ready qualified specialist and not to waste time and money on nurturing a new specialist with an as yet unknown result. <br><br>  Moreover, it may even be profitable for individual companies to offer a former trainee a salary much higher than he currently receives (according to his actual experience) in the company that trained him, according to his actual experience, than to provide training for the same specialist.  At the same time, a reseller company can offer a newcomer the same salary as their specialists with 2-3 years experience.  Which in turn can raise a wave of employee discontent and, as a result, a salary race. <br><br>  Do you have internship programs in your company?  Do you grow young cadres, try to win over from the ‚Äúmarket‚Äù or do you have no need for special training? <br><br>  What to do with a narrow specialized education?  How to do so to prepare a specialist was beneficial to all.  The young man himself is not in a position to invest 20-30 thousand euros in his training ... Is it worth it to give it to the companies themselves that cooperate with training centers of SAP solution providers.  Or do you need to create higher education?  But then there are questions related to financing, accreditation, licensing ... </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/85722/">https://habr.com/ru/post/85722/</a></p>
