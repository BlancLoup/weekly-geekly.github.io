No matter how much you love your work, it is difficult to maintain the ‚Äúburning‚Äù state.  This is especially true of working with clients.  The unforgettable ‚Äúyou are many, and I am one‚Äù is a fair thesis, which hides the main problem of customer service managers and support.  Working with people is not a vocation for everyone, but if it‚Äôs so that you work in a client service, it is important to be able to set up yourself correctly and periodically ‚Äúremind‚Äù yourself about the essence and rules of client service.  I will give below a summary of a small training that will help contact center staff to refresh the basic principles of CS.  Managers - take note. <br><br>  The training consists of three main blocks: <br><br>  <b>1. Why?</b>  Here we will talk about the attitude to work and the "super-idea" of quality service. <br>  <b>2. How?</b>  About overcoming barriers and secrets of conversation management. <br>  <b>3.What?</b>  How to resolve a conflict, how to respond to written claims, how to calm down yourself. <a name="habracut"></a>

      <b>1. Why?</b> <br><br>  First of all, you need to figure out what an excellent customer service is and what are its components.  This is what the employees put on: <br><br>  -quality product <br>  - no errors <br>  -the ability to solve problems <br>  - providing correct information (honesty) <br>  - fulfillment of promises <br>  - quick feedback <br>  -culture service (care, courtesy, availability) <br><br>  As you can see, half the success depends directly on the client department.  It is clear that if we work where we don‚Äôt like and do what we don‚Äôt like, the brain tells us from the self-preservation instinct - don‚Äôt do it.  The quality of work in this case suffers greatly.  You can do well only a favorite thing.  And if you have not dreamed of working in the field of customer service since childhood, and you most likely did not dream, you just have to change your attitude. <br><br>  <i>Exercise "What I do at work"</i> <br>  For 5 minutes, think about what you are doing at work on the scale I, Client, Company, Country-World. <br><br>  Employees should see that what they are doing is not just work, but something more.  In the chosen profession it is important to respect yourself and your work, to identify your role.  The service should come from the heart: when we do not only what is needed, but also what is not necessary to do, we add a piece of ourselves.  But this can be done only if you yourself are full, happy, positively looking at the world. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c13/185/763/c13185763e2944fe80f9bf22848c4894.jpg"><br>  <i>The exercise ‚ÄúI am a genius‚Äù</i> <br>  Tell us what you are genius.  Maybe in cooking borscht or you can get the tongue to the nose?  What are you pros? <br><br>  Summary.  An important human quality for working in customer service is fullness.  The desire to help others will arise when there is a clear understanding: I am free to choose my profession, I appreciate my place and I know for whom and why I do it. <br><br>  <b>2. How?</b> <br><br>  We are on fire and we are already rushing to help everyone like a chipidale, but how to make contact correctly?  How to learn to understand the client and speak in such a way that he understands?  Go ahead and see what tools we use to communicate with customers.  (I make an amendment that we focus on talking on the phone). <br><br>  Here are the main components of speech communication. <br><br>  <b>1. Phonetic.</b>  This includes the tempo of speech, voice modulation, rhythm, intonation, timbre, diction, background noise.  In general, this is how our voice sounds. <br>  <b>The essence of the barrier:</b> Extreme sound prevents the client from understanding what you are saying - too quickly, too low, chomping and chewing, without pauses and semantic stresses. <br>  <b>How to overcome:</b> Overwhelmingly more attractive, smooth, calm, measured speech sounds - golden mean in everything.  Ideally, you need to adapt to the client and be able to "mirror" its sound. <br><br>  <i>Exercise "Expressive reading"</i> <br>  Give the staff a paragraph with text that you need 1. read expressively, like in school 2. read at a given pace / pitch / intonation, for example: slowly, highly, roughly. <br><br>  2. <b>Semantic.</b>  These are the meanings of words. <br>  <b>The essence of the barrier:</b> Here I would highlight two features.  1. People put different meanings in one and the same word 2. Professional slang, incomprehensible to a client.  In both cases, you lose contact because you speak different languages. <br>  <b>How to overcome:</b> It is necessary to understand the peculiarities of a person and use language that is understandable to him  In this case, words that have different meanings need to be clarified, and unknown to the client, to decipher. <br><br>  <i>Exercise "Explainers".</i> <br>  Break employees into pairs or 2 groups.  Hand out cards with your professional terms: some explain them in human language, others guess what it is. <br><br>  3. <b>Logical.</b>  It occurs when the chain of our reasoning is too complicated or does not correspond to the one to which the interlocutor got used. <br>  <b>The essence of the barrier: A</b> dissatisfied customer often gladly complicates and winds up the situation, mixing emotions and side events to the core.  ‚ÄúAnd on this day my cat got sick and I didn‚Äôt sleep all night, I waited for you for three hours, because of this, the Internet broke, as I give my mother-in-law the gift she comes tomorrowaaa!‚Äù.  And sometimes they just refuse to use logic. <br>  <b>How to overcome:</b> Simplify the situation and present it to the client in two or three steps, highlighting only the essence.  Another good way is to simulate a similar situation in the usual conditions for the client.  Let's say a client lost a card and paid her off at an online store.  The client demands that the online store return the amount: I did not buy anything, the money was from you, this is a fraud, you do not watch for security, I will file a lawsuit.  It is possible to expand the logic of the client into the mainstream: Imagine you lost money from your wallet, someone picked them up and bought bread ... <br><br>  <i>Exercise "Case"</i> <br>  To invite employees to unleash a complex chain, take the most difficult case from the practice of your company. <br><br>  4. <b>Stylistic.</b>  The style of speech depends on the situation in which the speakers are located.  At the seminar at the university - the scientific style, at the working rally - business, for dinner at the bar - conversational. <br>  <b>The essence of the barrier:</b> When the seller speaks to you in a boutique, like Aunt Klava from a nearby stall.  The style of communication with the client - the style of your company, your face.  It can be more or less formal depending on who your customers are and what you sell.  Contrary to the opinion of the existence of stop words that provoke a conflict, in fact, the client stresses the impression of incorrect accents, parasitic words, speech errors and the inability to put two words together. <br>  <b>How to overcome:</b> speak correctly. <br><br>  <i>Exercise "Russian"</i> <br>  Disassemble any exercise from the style book. <br><br>  On this we will take a break, in the second part I will talk about verbalization, how to explain to the client myself what he wants and give a simple algorithm to get out of the conflict. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/260633/">https://habr.com/ru/post/260633/</a></p>
