    <h3>  JavaDay sixth - how it will be </h3><br>  Last year's 5th anniversary conference pleased the participants with 5 tracks with interesting sessions from <b>40 speakers</b> .  This year, the event <b>will repeat the success of JavaDay 2015</b> , <a href="https://dou.ua/lenta/articles/results-of-the-2015/">which ranked second among the IT events in Ukraine</a> .  The conference especially the event will please those who want to get as many insights as possible. <cut><br><br>  The purpose of the conference is to give the community the opportunity to effectively learn and to communicate with colleagues.  <a href="http://datacenter.ua/">The conference center ‚ÄúParkovy‚Äù</a> , where the event will take place, will allow developers and speakers to comfortably achieve both goals. <br><br>  Those who are lucky enough to visit JavaDay at least once, are well aware that in addition to <br><br><ul><li>  discover the best and newest methods in working with java </li><li>  chat with leading international and Ukrainian Java-stars </li><li>  make new interesting and useful acquaintances </li><li>  become part of the java community </li></ul><br>  All participants of the conference will have a lot of unexpected and pleasant surprises from the partners of the event, an unforgettable atmosphere and an <b>unconventional approach to the organization</b> . <br><br>  For example, last year the entire series of events was devoted to the 20th anniversary of Java and all participants in JavaDay in Kiev had an incredible opportunity to ask a question personally to James Gosling, who spoke online with conference participants. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/acc/9cd/7df/acc9cd7df95748f4aa1c1394f88d2b06.png" alt="image"><br><br><h3>  Program </h3><br>  The organizers form an interesting and rich program of the event.  At the moment (September 1) it is formed by 98%. <br><br>  A distinctive feature of the conference this year will be the participation of a group of speakers from Pivotal, known for its <b>Spring Framework</b> and the ecosystem of products around it.  We tried to company representatives told about the most popular products to date. <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Juergern Hoeller</b> - the author of the Spring Framework, in his reports will tell about the new version of Spring 4.3, as well as about the opportunities that are expected in Spring 5, which is scheduled for 2017. </li><li>  <b>St√©phane Nicoll</b> - one of the main developers of Spring Boot, will talk about its capabilities, scope and future plans to develop </li><li>  <b>Christoph Strobl</b> - Spring Data Committer, will share the new features of Spring Data to create REST applications, as well as its interaction with Redis </li><li>  <b>Alvaro Videla</b> - Core Developer for RabbitMQ, will give a talk on Distributed Systems, approaches and solutions used to build Distributed Systems </li></ul><br>  To keep the balance, there will also be a series of reports on Java EE.  We hope that by the time of the conference, Oracle will share its future plans regarding the fate of this platform. <br><br>  <b>Reza Rahman</b> is a former Oracle Evangelist for Java EE, and now one of the leaders of the JavaEE Guardian group, at a meeting of JUG UA (which will be held before the conference), will talk about the plans and prospects of Java EE 8 in a live communication format with the audience. JMS 2 master class, and together with <b>Ivar Grimstad</b> (Java Champion and JCP member) will talk about the planned specifications for Java EE Security, HTTP 2, JMS 2.1, Java EE Microprofile for creating microservices. <br><br>  Traditionally, what kind of JavaDay does without <b>Baruch Sadogursky</b> and <b>Zhenya Borisov</b> !  We are waiting for new reports from the battles, puzzlers, and as usual, a lot of positive!  In addition to reports, Eugene will hold a master class on Apache Spark. <br><br>  The organizers are very happy to see that from year to year the number of domestic speakers is significantly increasing.  And according to the results of the voting, their reports are among the five best reports of the conference.  Among the local stars of Java development I would like to highlight: <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Nikolai Alimenkov</b> , organizer JEEConf and XPDays </li><li>  <b>Taras Matiaszewski</b> , founder of Morning @ Lohika meetings </li><li>  <b>Egor Bugaenko</b> , whose reports simply can not leave students indifferent! </li></ul><br><h3>  Subject tracks </h3><br>  The topics the speakers will cover will be as practical as possible and relevant to the current challenges facing Java developers: <br><br><ol><li>  Core JVM platform and Java SE (Java 8) </li><li>  Languages ‚Äã‚Äãand new programming paradigms </li><li>  Web development and Java Enterprise technologies </li><li>  Architecture &amp; Cloud </li><li>  BigData &amp; NoSQL </li><li>  Software engineering practices </li></ol><br>  This year, the organizers have tried to focus more on the subject of <b>Web development and Java Enterprise technologies</b> . <br><br><h3>  How to get to the event </h3><br>  Tickets for the conference can be <a href="http://jdkyiv2016.ticketforevent.com/">purchased online</a> .  So far, Early Bird tickets are available, the number of which is limited and scatters like birds in the morning.  If you have questions about the ticketing system and your ticket, send them to support@ticketforevent.com. <br><br><h3>  Partners </h3><br>  The conference is a traditionally non-commercial event this year is supported by such companies as EPAM (title partner), Globallogic, Luxoft, Levi9, Sigma, Microsoft (golden partners), Red Hat (silver partner) and a large friendly company of media partners. <br><br>  If you suddenly realize the need to participate along with the partners stated above - <a href="http://javaday.org.ua/2015/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/JD_B2B_IT_Kyiv-2.pdf">read the conditions</a> and write to the organizers who will be happy to support the initiative that is so useful for both participants! <br><br><h3>  Useful </h3><br>  You can subscribe <a href="http://javaday.org.ua/kyiv/">to</a> JavaDay 2016 news and updates <a href="http://javaday.org.ua/kyiv/">on the conference website</a> , <a href="https://www.facebook.com/javadayukraine">on Facebook</a> <a href="http://jug.ua/">and on the Java User Group website</a> .
