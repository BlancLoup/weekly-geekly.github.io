KPI HR professionals consider their medal and work.  And almost all of this should not happen with KPI, because it is an ordinary metric that shows the performance of each employee and ensures the conversion of labor results into certain points, and already if you wish, money into money.  Time passes, problems do not decrease, KPI in the IT field is generally a talk of the town.  This time we decided to sort out three important issues of using key indicators in companies.  Give me the right carrot! <br><br> <a href="https://habr.com/company/regionsoft/blog/422241/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2f1/961/20b/2f196120b7a429094d350b4c182fa200.png"></a> <br>  <i><font color="#999999">KPI must be correct</font></i> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  <font color="#cc0000">How to approach the calculation of KPI?</font>  <font color="#cc0000">What is better to consider?</font> </h2><br><h3>  <font color="#cc0000">Let's start with the answer to the second question - what is the best way to count?</font> </h3><br>  <b>1. Probably the most popular way is to read in Excel.</b>  This is a handy tool: you can write various indicators in separate sheets and then calculate the aggregated indicator using the formulas on the main sheet. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

      <br>
      <b>Advantages:</b> simple, affordable, inexpensive (except for the cost of Excel itself). <br><br>  <b>Disadvantages:</b> difficulties in collecting and aggregating indicators, you first have to collect indicators from employees, then the manager checks the data, collect them in one document, transfer data to the accounting department or top manager.  Additional difficulties arise when working with formulas and macros - someone, let him down.  Excel Excel KPI is the easiest to fake. <br><br>  <b>2. Read in a specialized program.</b>  There is software that allows you to calculate KPI based on the characteristics of the data and the desired mechanism of calculation.  These are quite complex programs that are either fully focused on the calculation of key indicators, or contain some other business functionality. <br><br>  <b>Advantages:</b> powerful set of features, ease of data collection, security. <br><br>  <b>Disadvantages: the</b> first is the high cost of solutions, we just cannot explain the prices of some vendors.  The second is the complexity and congestion of the interface.  Third - you need to purchase the next software in your software zoo, and these are additional costs. <br><br>  <b>3. Read in CRM system.</b>  We have tested for several years, used and refactored KPI calculation module in <a href="http://www.regionsoft.ru/">RegionSoft CRM</a> .  The result is an advanced tool that assumes the possibility of calculating both the simplest indicators and complex composite subsidiaries, including those requiring the use of scripting, thanks to which the complexity of calculating indicators actually becomes unlimited.  Thus, together with CRM you get a powerful software for calculating KPI. <br><br>  <b>Advantages: the</b> first is maximum automation.  The second is that you don‚Äôt need to enter data manually, you set up rules for calculating indicators and they take data from a CRM system that knows about all transactions and business processes in a business as they fill in the operational workflow.  Everything works online, in a unified information system and fully automatically. <br><br>  <b>Disadvantages:</b> setting up some complex indicators requires programming skills. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#cc0000">Now how to count</font> </h3><br>  Determine the strategic goals of your company - in general and for each department in particular.  <i><font color="#999999">For example, we have a company RegionSoft Developer Studio and we are developing CRM.</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">Like any developer, we have strategic goals: develop software, update and refactor developed software, sell our software, maintain a pool of users (and there are thousands of them).</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">Accordingly, there should be key indicators (KPI) for salespeople, for technical support staff and for ... and we will leave programmers alone.</font></i>  So, set goals and determine how each unit contributes to them.  In this case, goals can be both financial and targeted, and mixed. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/df1/be3/16f/df1be316f638f468e03748e5aa16aaa4.png"></div><br>  <i><font color="#999999">And this is the only performance indicator that grows.</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">Unfortunately, this is my blood pressure.</font></i> <br><br>  Select measurable, feasible and achievable KPIs ( <a href="https://habr.com/company/regionsoft/blog/308800/">we wrote exactly what they should be</a> ).  Set the measurement: weight, monetary and quantitative expression.  Specify correction factors and periods for analysis. <br><br>  <i><font color="#999999">For example, you want to set a sales plan for hardware in the amount of 12,000,000 rubles per year by three salespeople, while it is your priority that the dowels sell for at least 30% of the amount.</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">We estimate: in a month it is necessary to sell for 1,000,000 rubles, of which for 300,000 rubles.</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">dowels</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">We set a plan for the manager - 333,300 rubles. At the same time, for the sale of dowels, we assign a transaction rate of 0.02 - that is, the manager will receive 2% of the sum of sold dowels, and for the other hardware 0,015 - 1.5%.</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">The result - managers will be motivated to sell more dowels, because for an equal volume of sales from the sale of dowels they will get a big salary.</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">This is KPI.</font></i> <br><br>  With seeming simplicity, the calculation of KPI makes it difficult for companies, and responsible managers either simply divide shares between titles, or move away to matrices with an assessment of loyalty to colleagues, mutual assistance and other ways to get legitimate "-2". <br><br>  In our new <a href="http://www.regionsoft.ru/">RegionSoft CRM 7.0,</a> we tried to eliminate the human factor and carefully reworked the old KPI mechanism, which we <a href="https://habr.com/company/regionsoft/blog/308800/">wrote about in Habr√©</a> .  Now you can use the KPI calculation wizard or configure the scorecard manually.  How it works? <br><br>  In RegionSoft CRM KPI can be customized for each employee based on his personal duties and the goals of his unit. <br><br>  The first step is to analyze the data in the KPI calculation base.  This can be any information registered in the system: <br><br><ul><li>  Targets - incidents (events, results, achievements of any employee) <br></li><li>  Financial indicators - documents (invoices, acts, invoices, orders, payments, etc.) <br></li><li>  Free-form indicators, which are collected using a PascalScript program script. <br></li></ul><br>  Any indicator can be composite and include several types of data.  Next, you set up planning profiles with a set of indicators for each of the employees, for the departments or the company as a whole.  Plans can be set for the day, week, month, quarter and year. <br><br>  Here is how it is done: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/O2oLSg9djPc" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  According to the results of KPI accrual in <a href="http://www.regionsoft.ru/">RegionSoft CRM,</a> you can collect several reports on the achievement of goals in the context of indicators with or without detailing.  By the way, each employee in the CRM interface sees his own personal KPI monitor and can track how fast he is going to fulfill the planned indicators. <br><br>  Also on the basis of the calculation of KPI in our CRM-system, you can calculate the salary: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gGWiCwwDamQ" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  If you need to configure complex KPIs, then RegionSoft CRM can calculate absolutely everything - it would be a skill.  If you need help to set up your KPI system, vendor experts will always come to the rescue and are ready to organize turnkey accounting, and if you want to figure it out for yourself, watch this video: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hJT6FranUd4" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><h2>  KPI hate and that is a fact.  What to do? </h2><br><h3>  Implementing KPI, you can get a sharp negative.  And this is a problem </h3><br>  If the company has a KPI, they most likely do not like it.  This is a common situation, despite the fact that these factors have an initially positive goal - to pay an employee a bonus for his work, to evaluate achievements (we remind everyone that KPI can add money to the salary, but cannot deduct money from the salary!).  Why it happens? <br><br><ul><li>  Employees could have negative experiences at previous workplaces where KPIs acted as an instrument of control and intimidation by a despotic micro-manager (a person who does not work by checking each step of an employee).  Often, managers use the KPI system as a tool to build self-loyalty, a way of blackmail and total control.  In such conditions, employees not only strive to achieve some sometimes completely ephemeral figures (‚Äúfollowing corporate culture‚Äù, ‚Äúinterest in the company's life‚Äù), but also behave like schoolgirl honors, who compare scores and mistakes, trying to find out what wrong teacher.  Such an approach can be imposed by managers and middle managers, and comes to the general in the last place, and sometimes only when the next offended and dismissed employee talks. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b3d/8c5/16b/b3d8c516b609f70db5164db5e5688598.png" width="400"></div><br>  <i><font color="#999999">They worked a bit, wrote a lot of reports - so where are the KPIs that reflect our performance?</font></i> <br><br>  In many respects, KPIs in a CRM system (that is, an automated product) are good because they eliminate such situations - you can easily monitor all KPIs for each employee, view the details of charges, open and see how the indicators are calculated.  Finally, one or two responsible, competent and at the same time independent people who have access to monitoring the performance of indicators can be installed in a CRM system. <br></li><li>  Employees could have negative experience in previous jobs, where KPIs acted as a tool to control employee behavior ‚Äî namely, behavior.  That is, KPIs are aimed not at fulfilling business goals, but at obeying the will of the employee, forcibly introducing him into the corporate culture. <br><br>  <i><font color="#999999">For example, in one company, in KPI, besides the fulfillment of the plan, three behavioral factors were taken into account: ‚Äútotal contactability‚Äù, ‚Äúopenness to a new one‚Äù, ‚Äúnumber of appeals to colleagues‚Äù (if more than three, this is bad and a reduction factor).</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">An additional problem in the company was that the holder of the KPI process was the HR department, who was friends with marketing and hated sales.</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">As a result, the entire system of indicators, which should be tied to a commercial result, was directed against the main part of commerce.</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">Do not do it this way.</font></i> <br></li><li>  Employees are afraid of measuring their failures.  Alas, the KPI system is a mirror of the employee‚Äôs work, and without errors, only the one who does nothing is obtained.  Of course, it‚Äôs very unpleasant to see a zero or lowering coefficient, and here you need to think over the system so that it is encouraging, not punitive.  That is, the logic is as follows: ‚Äúperformed a little‚Äù - ‚Äúearned a small premium‚Äù, ‚Äúperformed a lot‚Äù - ‚Äúearned a large premium‚Äù. <br></li><li>  Employees are afraid not to reach the maximum.  Again, the problem is connected with the formulation of the indicators themselves included in the KPI system.  Employees should be aware of the conditions for reaching the maximum and clearly understand the reason for failure in order to change the situation in the next period. <br></li><li>  The manager measures everything that can be measured (does the right thing) and drags it all into the KPI, shifting 100% of the responsibility for the business to the employees (doing wrong).  Do not confuse analytics with the KPI system - the first allows you to go through the instruments, the second - helps to achieve the main business goals.  In no case, managers should not drag indicators that are not dependent on the employee‚Äôs work in KPIs (for example, put the length of the software product development cycle in a salesman‚Äôs KPI). <br></li></ul><br>  An important point: <b>employees can look for ways to fake odds or correct them</b> before directly calculating remuneration.  All their work will turn into a pursuit of performance indicators.  Productivity from this will not grow.  Be sure to check employee access rights to the file or KPI counting system, protect cells and sheets when it comes to Excel.  Do not hesitate to double-check the data provided, if you do not have enough automation configured.  Good advice: try to avoid working with KPI in browser applications, where you can replace links, transfer false data and find other workarounds. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#cc0000">How to overcome these barriers?</font> </h3><br><ul><li>  To make KPIs measurable, achievable, plans and goals - real and reasonable.  This is the key to avoiding most troubles. <br></li><li>  All employees who are motivated with KPI must understand what the scorecard is made of and how it works.  Show your KPI calculation scheme to your colleagues, explain why each goal is assigned exactly this weight, additionally consider the details for the month. <br></li><li>  Include high-level indicators with high weight in KPI.  So you will get less profanation and poor performance.  <i><font color="#999999">For example, there may be a goal - to make 300 calls per month, or maybe a goal - to make sales of 270,000. If these are equivalent figures, your employees will simply make 300 or even 350 calls, but they will not sell anything.</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">Therefore, the KPI system should be built in such a way that it could not be possible to ‚Äúearn‚Äù as much as with simple tasks, even with a 200% over-fulfillment of the plan.</font></i>  In this way you will avoid cheating and possible frauds with indicators. <br></li><li>  Visualize KPI - this is important.  If an employee has a diagram, diagram, percentages, progress bar before his eyes, it is easier for him to perceive the need to achieve the goal.  This is a kind of gamification mechanism - you are not so much trying to ring around 100 evil companies, fix 60 minor bugs or complete the development of 9 features in time, but try to bring the progress bar to 100%.  It really works, we even wrote this socket - every employee sees it in the main RegionSoft CRM window: <br></li></ul><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/010/906/a8c/010906a8c4ca960bbf05b7eec0248b62.png"></div><br><ul><li>  Make KPI private, not public.  Do not discuss the results for the period in the presence of other employees, do not compare the work of one employee with another, all claims must be made in private.  However, the overall results and the plan / actual indicators for the company (divisions) need to be talked about publicly. <br></li></ul><br>  People play games and seek to get achievements, some of which are transformed into in-game currency.  They like it and they are passionately pursuing goals.  In fact, the same KPI.  But for some reason, KPIs (carrying real money!) Are not loved, but because of the achivok they do not sleep at night.  It seems there is something to think about. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#cc0000">KPI for developers: the truth is somewhere near</font> </h2><br>  We could not get around this topic.  The question that has been raised a dozen times on Habr√© and other IT-related resources can confuse anyone.  This is the question of what a software developer's KPI should be.  There can be no definitive answer here: yes, of course, you can evaluate completed tasks, closed bugs, amount of code (by functionality, not by lines of code, of course), time spent on different projects, but this is somehow ... subjective, whether. <br><br>  KPI is essentially a motivating tool.  For example, for the sale of a product with a higher margin, the company puts the ratio higher, and the salesman seeks to ‚Äúmake‚Äù a plan on these products, and the business gets the desired sales volume.  What can we motivate a developer?  He creates an intellectual product and receives wages (often higher than managers) for closing work tasks.  You can‚Äôt give him a plan for recursive functions, for loops, or for code quality.  Either he did his job or not.  Therefore, a KPI for a programmer can only be unrelated to the main work at the level of ‚Äúhelping colleagues, mentoring, participating in meetings and articles on Habr√©‚Äù.  But this is insanity, you see, to direct the work and time of a person to a non-working course, so that he earns more. <br><br>  Once upon a time, a foreign article on how to make KPI for web-programmers came across a long time ago.  This is what was proposed to be assessed: actual working hours versus hours according to the TOR, the number of errors, the availability of documentation (well, these three points are still far away), explanations with the customer, developer enthusiasm, level of development of the requirements, confidence in the successful completion of the project, communication with members commands, the effectiveness of the selected approaches to programming ... All of this was suggested to be evaluated on a scale from 1 to 10. It seems something like this: if, after talking with the customer, the developer kicked the table, hit the keyboard and said ‚Äúbl ...‚Äù, this is 1 or 2, and glad  stno poured coffee and expressed enthusiasm - 9 or 10. In short, this is not a story that should be followed. <br><br>  And I came across a private <a href="https://medium.com/%40yupyork/the-best-developer-performance-metrics-6295ea8d87c0">research</a> in which 300 developers answered the question of which indicators they consider to be key: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ece/b83/443/eceb83443faf2406c6c8c884a3121cd7.png"><br>  <i><font color="#999999">You, as a developer, what do you think is the most important metric of developer effectiveness?</font></i> <br><br>  Here is how the answers were distributed: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a9c/ed4/342/a9ced4342ad88b741a524938c7346f59.png"><br><br>  <i>The case when you do not need a translation, but you need to wipe your eyes to believe that these items were designated by the developers themselves, and not their team leaders or project managers.</i>  <i>The ‚Äúdeveloper's personality‚Äù from 12.6% and 10.8% of the ‚Äúlines of code‚Äù is somewhat frightening.</i>  <i>But the test coverage and the quality of the code is completely nothing (here, the truth is, another question arises - what is the quality of the code, how to evaluate it?).</i> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/419/712/24a/41971224a974f533423056eaed41e4b1.png" width="500"></div><br>  <i><font color="#999999">But we know how to evaluate quality, we know :-)</font></i> <br><br>  Reaction to results instead of a thousand words: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1c4/26f/80a/1c426f80a61eddd093661428efce31d1.png"><br>  <i><font color="#999999">So the "quick and friendly" won?</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">Idiocy.</font></i> <br><br>  If, in addition to jokes, you can still dig around and find those metrics that are applicable for KPI in development.  (By the way, for those who need it, there is a wonderful <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-are-good-KPIs-for-programmers">discussion on Quora</a> ). <br><br>  If you have Agile (and to some extent it is now for many, just not all with troubles, unnecessary staff and the realization that it is Agile), then you can choose indicators such as reducing the time from idea to launch, changing the duration of the development cycle , change in the quality and duration of the sprint, closed tasks and developed features from the backlog.  But again, we need integrated indicators, because in August you can pull out 7 tasks from the backlog like ‚Äúadd blue font to the interface‚Äù, ‚Äúmake a green fill in the final fields‚Äù, and in September it can be 0.5 tasks, but from the category "Add custom calculator functionality."  Therefore, targets must be correlated with business goals.  For example, in the case of a factor being tied to backlog analysis, each type of task is assigned its own weights.  In KPI, you can include the degree of software fault tolerance and the number of bugs (open and fixed). <br><br>  However, each developer is a unique person with his own approaches, speed of work, quality, parallel tasks, etc.  And even fragments of one project are not similar one to another.  Therefore, to bind a programmer to KPI is still a very bad idea - firstly, if it does not work, it can be seen without indicators, secondly, you can often ‚Äúget stuck‚Äù on something, solve the most important problem for software, but remain without a premium thirdly, the assessment is still subjective.  Therefore, it is better to choose a permanent premium upon ‚Äúfulfilled in time - fulfilled before deadline‚Äù, etc.  Otherwise, you can get demotivation and harm themselves. <br><br>  We have succeeded in such a simple conversation about KPI - without complicated formulas, which are so fond of being quoted in business magazines.  All formulas can be done automatically, using the KPI wizard, manual configuration or scripting in <a href="http://www.regionsoft.ru/">RegionSoft CRM</a> (well, or another software).  This is all a matter of technology.  The main thing is to understand why you need these indicators, how they will work and relate to the goals of the business, and where they will lead you.  Do not treat KPI as something extra complex, it is just a plan, a fact and an assessment of the implementation of this very plan.  Then the staff will perceive KPI as achivka.  Of course, not the one because of which the night does not sleep.  But like the one for which it is pleasant to work. <br><br>  And yes, do not implement KPI where they should not be.  There are enough of such areas in IT. <br><br><hr><br>  <b>‚Üí</b> <a href="http://www.regionsoft.ru/">Our new flagship RegionSoft CRM 7.0</a> <br><br>  <b>‚Üí</b> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DKtqzFNIde80%26list%3DPLqlF-KSlcmZ3ot5t2F0T5ov3jwhUkazF1">Slowly write a video with an overview of the functionality</a> <br><br>  <b>‚Üí</b> <a href="https://t.me/bizbreeze">Our Telegram channel</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/422241/">https://habr.com/ru/post/422241/</a></p>
