Under the cut are a few typical examples of what should not be done on Habr√©.  And what to do if drained. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8c0/d8e/535/8c0d8e5357bd139af68de596c18a49bb.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  According to our internal statistics, last year 656 publications out of 16,711 went down a bit. That's a little less than 4%.  Approximately half of them are removed in drafts, but the rest are still available.  I pulled out some of the brightest and most typical posts so that you can see what exactly should not be done on Habr√©, and how much it will cost in the minuses. <br><br>  Before turning to the experimental subjects I want to make an important remark - the authors of most of the articles written in the article have a lot of other publications that are quite normally estimated by the community.  Yes, and we once again faced the situation when the article of our colleague from one large company, on whose account there were more than a hundred successful posts on Habr√©, was suddenly on the list of those who were mined.  In general, and the old woman is prorukha!

      And, of course, I urge in no case minus the guys from the list below.  Firstly, they have already been minus one for you.  Secondly, it is always better to learn from the mistakes of others, and they have given us this opportunity.  Well, in general, you should always give a second chance.  After all, we are in a cultural and civilized community. <br><br><h2>  -77.  Tight commits </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7cb/5c3/4f0/7cb5c34f06d4087cc9489a96dbc46293.jpg"><br><br>  In <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/417163/">this</a> short narrative, the author jokingly draws parallels between programming and gang fights in one of the initial episodes of Boomer.  Civilized society completely rejects any reference to gopnichestvu and takes the note to the bottom.  "-77" is the anti-record of the year. <br><br>  Does it make sense to say that the parallels themselves are crooked and far-fetched?  Probably not. <br><br>  In general, Habr for cultural communication, and even jokes on this topic are doomed to failure. <br><br><h2>  -74.  How to fix the gender gap in technology </h2><br>  This is a <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/425993/">translation of a</a> feminist article where the author laments that there are few women in IT, and this must be corrected.  In the comments immediately noticed that white men also try not to take nannies just because they are men, but is it worth it to fix? <br><br>  In general, politics, religion and others like them are not without reason listed in the <a href="https://habr.com/ru/info/help/rules/">rules of conduct on the site</a> as extremely undesirable topics. <br><br><h2>  -64.  Sending e-mail from any address </h2><br>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/416573/">Article</a> about the mail function in PHP.  In particular, the fact that the argument "sender" can be any mailing address. <br><br>  The moral here is simple: if you suddenly discovered something, it would be a good idea to take a reference book or google it, isn‚Äôt it America? <br><br><h2>  -56.  Do not read books </h2><br>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/229721/">An article</a> that the world has changed, and in the books now is water, beautification and lies.  In general, radicalism for the sake of HYIP often leads to holivars.  And if you bend, then to the flooded posts at the very bottom. <br><br>  Moral - you always have to be objective and not to row it all together. <br><br><h2>  -53.  Who will save the theory of relativity? </h2><br>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/416781/">The</a> author's <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/416781/">second attempt</a> to refute the SRT.  The first collected one minus more. <br><br>  Moral - if you suddenly swung at the holy, a million times re-checked and working, submit it not as a statement, but as a question of the audience.  In the comments can get an interesting discussion, the results of which can be added to the article update.  Well, you need to understand who you are going against.  Einstein was already a very clever man, and with him there were also millions of practitioners. <br><br><h2>  -42.  Viber, WhatsApp, Telegram - which is better? </h2><br>  This <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/414893/">post</a> does not contain any useful information, but only a survey on the topic "What kind of messenger do you use?"  In most cases, such posts go into the minus due to the fact that in the title about a word.  The reader thinks that inside is comparison and constructive, and there, on the contrary, they will redirect the question to the reader himself. <br><br>  Also a separate problem in the first line of the post. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f30/7cb/148/f307cb1480dcc14c854f1a1eb0e82a51.png"><br><br>  To tell domestic developers that they have not created anything worthwhile except the Telegram (with the eccentric Durov at the head) is to turn everything inside out.  Russian developers have created many world-class products and platforms, in addition to the west, a meme about Russian hackers and Russian programmers is firmly rooted. <br><br>  In general, you should not do polls in posts with their only content (without specifying it in the title).  And if you want to throw a stone in the garden of colleagues, politeness, fact-checking and constructive things just do not interfere. <br><br><h2>  -42.  Social rating </h2><br>  This is a detailed <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/417333/">retelling of</a> one of the Black Mirror series.  On Habr√©. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9fe/635/a3e/9fe635a3e26f019caa8ee2b36111ed5d.png"><br><br>  In my understanding, the series are looking to rest.  If you start to retell someone a series from the series, then the first thing you can hear in response is: ‚Äúwait, do not say anything, let me see!‚Äù.  In general, the alien rest steal is not necessary.  And if you want to raise an important problem, it is better to look at it through the eyes of facts or results.  For example, <a href="https://ria.ru/20190519/1553583356.html">here</a> clearly has something to discuss on the topic of social rating.  And this in spirit is much closer to Habr. <br><br><h2>  -41.  To new meetings </h2><br>  Worse than welcome posts can only be a <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/neurodatalab/blog/425727/">farewell</a> .  Both those and others do not contain a constructive and bring into the expert community half unrealizable promises, rivers of tears and self-advertisement. <br><br>  On the other hand, a welcome post may well come in if it comes from a recognized leader.  But again, there must be something useful and valuable in it. <br><br><h2>  -40  TOP 5 things that can be printed on a 3D printer [video] </h2><br>  Posts consisting of only one <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/3dtool/blog/418075/">video</a> , almost always go into the minus.  Video is a special format, and the reader does not always have the opportunity to ‚Äúconsume‚Äù it.  In addition, Habr is always texts.  And "alien" elements are quickly discarded here.  In this video can be a good addition to the full post. <br><br><h2>  -33.  Tale of coursework </h2><br>  In journalism, there is a good rule - to respect the reader's time and not waste it, and, at the same time, not to waste your personal time pouring water into regular texts.  Win-win.  And in <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/430794/">this</a> text water is 80 percent. And although it is issued as a ‚Äúspecial‚Äù style of presentation, this does not change the essence.  Well, speaking of styles, one must be able to flow the stream of consciousness. <br><br><h2>  -31.  Riddles resume.  Part 2. Font also matters </h2><br>  On Habr√© there are many posts from HR specialists, which tells about the noticeable influence of any secondary factors when applying for a job or at interviews.  Developers also believe that the assessment of their professional qualities should be based, for the most part, on the results of their work and demonstrated skills.  To me, this situation seems to be a conflict between humanities and techies.  And because of the numerical superiority of one over the other, the <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/359465/">victims</a> are known in advance. <br><br><h2>  -27.  What is mining, and why mine on video cards </h2><br>  It is a very indicative <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/smileexpo/blog/409671/">case</a> when, as a whole, everything seems to be true, but in individual details it is full of seams.  There is a lack of fact-checking from the terms used to the description of individual technologies. <br><br>  There is only one conclusion from this story: if you use a term, describe a process or mention an entity, you must be ready to answer all the questions, and you need to clarify in advance whether you have mixed up something in the wording.  You can easily burn on the little things. <br><br><h2>  -27.  Artificial intelligence is also wrong.  As in the US, we cheated Amazon Go - the store of the future without cashiers and sellers </h2><br>  Rarely, but it happens that at the end of articles on Habr√© come across phrases like " <i>there are no technical details and never will</i> "!  And most often such posts fly in a minus, because Habr is just technical stories.  And so, judging by the content of the above <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/429656/">article</a> , it just has to start with this phrase.  But no.  In addition, its main content is hidden in a video, where two people not versed in the technique tell Habr about such a high-tech product as a shop without sellers and cashiers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/202/e61/a2e/202e61a2e13f572ab58a72c72be577b5.jpg"><br><br>  No comparisons, accurate data, descriptions of technologies.  In general, some such first impressions about the store from video-blogger marketers, with a logical result. <br><br>  Habr - these are technical stories.  And if you want to tell a marketing one, you need a technical / scientific approach to it (facts, figures, comparisons, research). <br><br><h2>  The bottom line </h2><br>  If you started reading from here, here are the main things you should pay attention to when writing posts: <br><br><ul><li>  Habr is a cultural community; </li><li>  do not touch politics, religion, national, gender and other similar topics; </li><li>  to be objective when emotions are overwhelmed; </li><li>  check if I discovered America; </li><li>  factcheking is an expert's best friend; </li><li>  not to make posts consisting of only one video or questionnaire; </li><li>  not to write welcome and farewell posts (and generally posts that do not contain useful or practical information for the reader); </li><li>  use a technical approach. </li></ul><br>  And one more thing that caught my eye when studying the list of mined articles: you should not try to separate the junas from the seniors, rank, sum up any basis or method.  Most of the previous attempts ended in cons, which generously poured those and others.  No one likes when they begin to "count." <br><br>  If you consider these moments to be captains, you can see above exactly how many minuses each of these mistakes will be evaluated. <br><br><h2>  What if something went wrong </h2><br>  Hide post in drafts until all details are clarified or until errors are corrected.  At the same time, do not panic, if suddenly, immediately after the publication, someone slapped a couple of minuses.  Perhaps it was criticized (a couple of very minus accounts at Habr√© I watched personally).  But in general, according to our internal statistics, there are five times more pluses on Habr√© than minuses. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d52/331/e92/d52331e9244b324d4d0052320841ed68.png"><br><br>  Therefore, it is necessary to wait for comments or the moment when the final assessment of the post reaches the threshold, for example, at -7, and then clean up. <br><br>  And it is also important to remember that there is a rupture on the old woman.  For example, the author of one of the posts I took above has an article in his asset with 260 pluses. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/456358/">https://habr.com/ru/post/456358/</a></p>
