      In general, stock up on popcorn, sit back, and let's get down to business. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#1565c0">What is the problem HDD drives?</font> </h3><br>  The problem is that the usual HDD drives that we still use in computers have not changed since the 1990x <sup><a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2596%25D1%2591%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9_%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA">wiki</a></sup> , when it was first decided to make HDDs working on 4300 rpm and 5400 rpm (revolutions per minute) <br><br>  It was 2016 - 20-25 years later, we still have the same 5,400 rpm disks running at 60-90 MB / s, but user needs have changed a long time ago, now we are working with huge projects and a large number of files in multitasking mode, requiring large bandwidth and responsiveness of the disk, even if several other programs are already doing the work in the background. <br>  Beginning in 2001, some manufacturers began to produce custom segment discs operating at 7200 revolutions per minute, instead of 5400, but this did not change anything, the increase from 90 MB / s to 120 MB / s (33% - 5400-7200) no significant effect. <br><br><br><h3>  <font color="#1565c0">Tests |</font>  <font color="#1565c0">synthetic (potential drive speeds)</font> </h3><br>  Below is a synthetic test comparing the performance of the most important aspect - the work of the disk with small blocks of data (in particular 4 KB): <br>  With read operations <br><ul><li>  HDD <b><font color="#1565c0">is 94 times</font></b> slower (0.68 MB / s versus 63.6 MB / s) compared to SSD </li><li>  HDD <b><font color="#1565c0">is 53 times</font></b> slower (0.36 MB / s versus 19 MB / s) compared to SSD </li></ul><br>  With write operations (write) <br><ul><li>  HDD <b><font color="#1565c0">is 178 times</font></b> slower (0.78 MB / s versus 139 MB / s) compared to SSD </li><li>  HDD <b><font color="#1565c0">is 86 times</font></b> slower (0.64 MB / s versus 55 MB / s) compared to SSD </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5bc/c57/9cc/5bcc579ccb8f45c48597533af4f15f78.png"><br><br>  Why are we mainly interested in the result of the disk with small blocks of data? <br>  The fact is that whether you open a browser, or import a project consisting of hundreds of files into a program like the Unreal Engine, it doesn‚Äôt matter what you do, in all such cases, the computer processes a huge number of small data blocks (reads mainly so read speed is usually more important than write speed) <br>  The sequential speed (‚ÄúSeq Q32T1‚Äù and ‚ÄúSeq‚Äù in the screenshot above) is important when writing / reading large file sizes (MB or GB), which occurs less frequently and does not affect the responsiveness of the system, as much as working with thousands of small blocks. <br><br><br><h3>  <font color="#1565c0">Why are Apple computers much more responsive than ordinary PCs and ‚Äúnever‚Äù slow down?</font> </h3><br>  In the world of computers, there is an opinion that the whole trouble in the operating system - Mac OSX on Apple computers is ‚Äúoptimized‚Äù, ‚Äúnever slows down‚Äù, ‚Äúthere are no blue screens of system failure‚Äù <br><br>  Maybe this is because: <br>  <b><font color="#1565c0">Apple computers (not counting the cheapest configuration):</font></b> they have all the same components, except one - the disk m.2 SSD / proprietary analogs: <br>  - Working at speed (700 - 1100 MB / s) via NVMe, having the ability to handle 65,000 wait threads, performing 65,000 commands each <br>  - Having data loss prevention systems, overheating protection systems that help prevent errors and freezes when working with several GB of data consisting mainly of small blocks in multitasking mode <br>  - etc.  etc. <br>  <b><font color="#1565c0">While, experience with Windows PC was</font></b> formed when working with computers that have: <br>  - Normal HDD 5400 rpm (noisy and vibrating during operation, due to the presence of moving parts) having the ability to handle 1 idle stream, performing 32 commands <br>  - Working at speed (60 - 110 MB / s) <br>  - Constantly forcing all users to observe the state - ‚ÄúNot responding‚Äù, to observe the mockingly slow response when working in multitasking mode, not only with small but also with relatively large blocks of data. <br><br>  Leaving all other components of the computer in place, swap the drives, putting 5400 rpm HDD on Apple, and m.2 SSD on Windows PCs, and it turns out that the disc is really the most important (for speed and responsiveness) part of the computer, since  A normal HDD disk is very slow, and makes the whole system wait until it finishes processing all task queues from programs and OS, which slows down a lot when working in multitask mode, having, moreover, applications that do the work in the background, which can be quite a lot - from auto-updating of project dependencies to tasks assigned for processing by the user. <br><br>  Now, move on to the tests!

You no longer have to stop the work of one application in order to speed up the responsiveness of others, because  it loaded the disc at 100%.  You do not have to wait a few seconds after each action in the Unreal Engine, in any aspect of the work, from importing files, before applying and testing assets. <br>  Not to mention the system reboot speed after updates, which occurs in seconds, instead of minutes, and the opening of applications, which is now happening "relatively" instantly. <br><br>  And so on and so forth. If you have come across all of this, you understand me well and have no sense in continuing to write resolved problems, if you don‚Äôt understand what it is about, you will most likely get bored reading a couple of hundred more problems resolved with SSD, anyway. <br><br>  From personal experience, I noticed that while working on a computer with HDD, you do not notice how much work is not productive and irritable because of constant expectations, and the status does not respond, especially if your work at the computer is not limited to climbing on the Internet. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#1565c0">Bottom line - do you need an SSD?</font> </h3><br>  If you need a disk: <br><ul><li>  Working absolutely silently (unlike HDD, having moving parts, creating noise and vibration) </li><li>  The disk, which does not make you nervous, because of the endless expectations and slow work of programs from the opening stage of the program - working in it - and before closing it, only because, unlike all other PC components and programs, the speed of the HDD drives The segment has not evolved over the past 20 years. </li><li>  If you need a drive that has the advantage of speed and responsiveness to the HDD several times in all types of tasks, from browsing the Internet to multitasking, proper development of code / games, working with 3D graphics, animation, particle simulation / video processing, audio / etc. </li></ul><br>  In that case, SSD is for you. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#1565c0">Poll</font> </h3></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/394135/">https://habr.com/ru/post/394135/</a></p>
