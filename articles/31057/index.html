  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Ten endangered IT professions</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Looking for an afterlife you don't have to go far - look at the computer industry.  Older systems live out in basements and back rooms.  Novell NetWare network engineers and OS / 2 administrators are finding it harder and harder to find helpers.  But just recently it seemed that these were very promising technologies and very promising professions. <br><br>  After consulting with IT recruiters, we compiled a list of computer skills, professions and technologies that, although not completely dead, are definitely approaching death.  Their universal popularity forever left behind. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>1. COBOL</b> <br>  The Y2k problem created a second gold rush for COBOL programmers.  In 2000, their abilities were worth their weight in gold.  But now, six and a half years later, there are no chances to save this profession.  This language has practically ceased to be taught at universities.  At the same time, practitioners claim that thousands of enterprises across America need COBOL programmers to maintain outdated but working systems.  Until now, COBOL is considered the programming language in which most lines of code were written. <br><br>  COBOL course is taught at Southern Illinois University.  The two largest Illinois companies are working with COBOL business applications and still need coders with this programming language.

      <b>2. Non-relational DBMS</b> <br>  In the 1980s, there were two main classes of database management systems: hierarchical systems such as IMS from IBM and System 2000 from the SAS Institute, as well as network-based DBMS, such as IDMS from CA and DBMS from Oracle, the former VAX DBMS.  Today, both of these types have been supplanted by relational databases, such as DB2, Oracle and Microsoft SQL Server. <br><br>  <b>3. Non-IP network</b> <br>  TCP / IP has conquered most of the networked world, and virtually no demand remains for IBM Systems Network Architecture (SNA) network specialists.  Recruiters claim that the value of this skill is close to zero.  Knowledge of SNA will add no more than 1% to the salary of a network engineer.  Although many banks, insurance firms, and other companies have invested heavily in the SNA network infrastructure, students in this specialty are almost never taught. <br><br>  <b>4. cc: Mail</b> <br>  The mail program for local networks, created in the 80s, had an audience of 20 million people at the peak of its popularity.  However, over time, email applications have been integrated into more complex groupware systems, such as Lotus Notes and Microsoft Exchange, so cc: Mail's popularity has waned.  In 2000, this program was completely removed from the market.  It disappeared as a class, because nowadays email clients are necessarily bundled with other corporate software, and cc: Mail has been isolated and therefore extinction is doomed.  The support of this product Lotus is now taken over by the company Global System Services from California. <br><br>  <b>5. ColdFusion</b> <br>  The once very popular and easy-to-learn web programming scripting language was created in the mid-90s by Allaire, which was later bought by Macromedia, which, in turn, was acquired by Adobe.  This language could not compete with other web development platforms, including Microsoft Active Server Pages and .Net, as well as Java, Ruby on Rails, Python, PHP and other open source languages.  The controversy is still going on as to how reliable and scalable ColdFusion applications are compared to competitors, while at the same time, in the web programmers market, the premium for knowledge of ColdFusion has significantly decreased. <br><br>  <b>6. C programming</b> <br>  As the web approaches, the C family of languages ‚Äã‚Äãbecomes less relevant.  And although C ++ and C Sharp are still alive and actively used, but knowledge of only the base language C is not enough to find at least some work. <br><br>  <b>7. PowerBuilder</b> <br>  A little more than ten years ago, PowerBuilder programmers were handled by employers like hotcakes.  In the early 90s it was a very relevant and promising technology.  In 1994, Sybase, a powerful competitor to Oracle, bought a client-server development system from Powersoft. <br><br>  Today, PowerBuilder developers are at the bottom of the ranking of hot jobs.  They have minimum salaries, which can be compared with the salaries of COBOL programmers.  This is all the more surprising because the PowerBuilder product continues to evolve: this year, the release of the PowerBuilder 11 version is expected, which will be able to generate .Net code. <br><br>  <b>8. Certified NetWare Engineers</b> <br>  In the early 90s, each of all the forces sought to obtain a trademark certificate from a NetWare engineer.  This is not surprising, because the company Novel controlled 90% of the PC server market.  The situation changed very quickly.  In just a couple of years, everyone switched to NT, so since then, CNE certificates have rapidly lost their value in the eyes of employers. <br><br>  <b>9. PC Network Administrators</b> <br>  As more and more networks are switching to servers under Windows, network administrators who are familiar with IBM servers (for example, AS / 400) are becoming less popular. <br><br>  <b>10. OS / 2</b> <br>  A rough but quite adequate assessment of OS / 2 would be: ‚Äúa mistake of nature‚Äù.  This unfortunate child of Microsoft and IBM was born into the world under loud fanfare in 1987, but very soon the parents quarreled and abandoned the unwanted child to the mercy of fate.  IBM officially ceased distribution of OS / 2 in 2005, and the small company Serenity Systems International is involved in the sale and maintenance of the system.  The unfortunate ‚Äúsemi-axis‚Äù is sold under a different name eComStation. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/31057/">https://habr.com/ru/post/31057/</a></p>
