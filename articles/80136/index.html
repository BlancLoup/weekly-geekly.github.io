  <section class="page js-page"><h1>PSP Go Review</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="http://img94.imageshack.us/img94/9523/pspgom.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  At first glance, it seems that the Sony PSP does not look like something radically new for the family of the PSP series.  Yes, it is more compact than the previous three generations of portable gaming and multimedia devices.  Yes, there appeared such new features as Bluetooth, a sliding controller, as well as a smaller and portable size of the device itself.  But the real change here is a radical deviation, i.e.  - it is a fact that Go became the first portable gaming system that became completely digital and abandoned cartridges and optical discs. <br>  Is this a good idea?  Well ... with the success of Apple's iPhone and iPhone Touch, which were not designed as gaming systems, Sony has no other choice but to leave this fact unnoticed and take the next step.  As they say, it's better late than never (you can ask if Sony should have taken this step 4 years ago, but that's another story). Nevertheless, although we welcome the transition to digital systems based on Internet connectivity, this is certainly a challenge, and how Sony will overcome them will go a long way in determining the success of Sony. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Design </h2><br>  Although the list of features is not much different from previous versions of the PSP, the PSP Go suffered a complete redesign, with the main focus on the retractable controller.  For now, the PSP Go is only available in black and white;  Do not be surprised if you see a large range of colors in the future in the markets. <br>  First, Sony got rid of the UMD connector and placed 16 GB of internal memory.  The screen also decreased: from 4.3 inches to 3.8 inches, while maintaining the same resolution at 480x272 pixels.  In addition, the Memory Stick Pro Duo slot has been replaced by a smaller slot - the Micro M2, which is also a development by Sony.  And finally, a sliding controller was added that hides the controls when you do not need to use them. <br>  This entire redesign has made the PSP Go 5.4 ounces easier than its predecessor, and its dimensions are now as follows: 5 inches wide, 2.75 inches high (when closed), and a little more than half an inch thick (about the open state of the device in width is about 4 inches).  In the closed state, Go looks very cute and minimalist, and we are pleased that this is the first PSP that easily fits in your pocket. <br><br><img src="http://img3.imageshack.us/img3/6829/45663098.jpg" alt="image">

      The screen seems much livelier and slightly brighter than 3000. A smaller screen size gives us less visual space, but since the resolution remains the same, some graphical details look sharper and clearer. <br>  The case of the PSP Go is made of black glossy plastic, as in all previous versions, and, all the same, fingerprints remain on the case.  However, the plastic around the buttons and the D-pad has a more matte finish.  The back side of the device has retained a glossy surface, but two rubber bands have appeared, which help you to hold the device in your hands. <br><br><img src="http://img697.imageshack.us/img697/5540/20890592.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  PSP Go is very comfortable to hold in your hands, but I definitely have some complaints about the button layout during the game.  We checked our PSP Go with MotorStorm: Arctic Edge and could not help but notice that the new position of the buttons is a bit inconvenient.  While this may not be a hindrance to newcomers, PSP veterans will most likely notice the changes. <br>  Analog Stick also became smaller than in previous PSP models, but at the same time more durable and durable.  Also, the friction in a circular motion has become more sensitive than in the PSP 1000-3000. <br>  For the most part, the buttons began to be felt and controlled very well.  The front control buttons are a little smaller compared to 3000, and now they are not as free as in previous models. <br>  The L and R buttons have become much more pronounced.  As for the Select and Start buttons, they became too close to each other and it became much less convenient to use them, especially during the game, when one of these buttons needs to be pressed quickly. <br>  The buttons of the display, the sound of the buttons and the volume were also transferred: they are now in the intermediate space between the L and R buttons. They all seem to be conveniently located and work well, but unfortunately, you will have to look at their location when the controller is pushed down. <br><img src="http://img94.imageshack.us/img94/148/99182385.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Most of the other buttons and switches remained in the same places as in previous versions of the PSP: the on / off switch is still in the lower right and the wireless communicator is on the lower left side, immediately below the new Micro M2 card slot. <br>  As already noted in the PSP Go added connection via Bluetooth 3.0.  This should make it easier to connect wireless devices, although I could not connect a stereo Bluetooth headset to it, which on the iPhone was no problem.  Nevertheless, the addition of Bluetooth gave Go a few interesting possibilities, one of which is the ability to control the PSP using the PS3 controller, although this needs to be configured. <br>  Like the PSP 3000, this model has a built-in microphone for applications such as Skype calls via Wi-Fi, etc.  The microphone is located between the analog stick and the Start and Select buttons.  (You can also choose: use the built-in microphone or Bluetooth headset microphone). <br>  Two things that you will not find in the PSP Go: a second analog joystick and a touch screen.  Which have long been in the wish list for the PSP.  This would make control in first person shooters much easier.  The lack of a touch screen is noticeable, since rival DS / DSi and iPhone / iPod touch gaming platforms have been using it for a long time.  The touch screen on the PSP will also be indispensable for a crane keyboard for web surfing and data entry. <br><br><h2>  Games and multimedia. </h2><br>  After removing the UMD socket, all multimedia applications and games must be accessible from 16 GB of internal memory or Micro M2 flash cards.  Users can download software from PlayStation Store directly to PSP Go (this is done using Wi-Fi) or when transferring data from a PC or PS3 via USB. <br>  Sony will sell multi-budget downloadable games (which will also be available on the UMD) and for this type of game I recommend downloading games on a PC or PS3 and then dumping them on the PSP Go instead of using the Wi-Fi connection on your PSP.  For example, loading of Motorstorm: Arctic Edge (520MB), via Go is more than 2 hours.  While on the PC, the jump took less than 20 minutes. <br>  PlayStation Store is not the most convenient online app store service I used.  You will not be able to see screenshots of the games, and, for the most part, they are not sorted in the most convenient and logical way.  Plus, as soon as you start downloading the game, your PSP Go essentially becomes blocked, i.e.  you cannot use it for any other purpose until your download is complete. <br>  If you have content on several Sony devices, and you are going to sync it with the PlayStation Network online service in order to be able to play everything that you downloaded or bought on all devices (games, videos). This is not the most convenient way, but it works, and the fact that you can sync up to 5 Sony devices (PSP and PS3) really pleases.  The best examples of this are games originally developed for Psone, which can be run on both the PS3 and PSP.  By purchasing them once you can synchronize them with other PSP or PS3 devices by downloading the game to your account at no additional charge. <br>  Those PSP owners who make the transition to Go will have to manually move the saved files from Stick Pro Duo to your new system.  This, of course, inconvenient.  But if you want to continue the game, which was synchronized with the online service - this should be done.  Also, the lack of a UMD drive prevents you from playing your old UMD games.  This is another reason the current owners of the PSP think twice before upgrading. <br>  In addition to the game, PSP Go is also a solid multimedia device.  In addition to playing video, digital music and viewing photos, a built-in web browser also appeared here.  In addition, a special Internet radio player appeared (although setting up access to the Internet and to music is something more confusing than it should be). <br>  Cords for connecting PSP Go to a TV (for watching videos and games) must be purchased separately. <br><br><h2>  operating system </h2><br>  The PSP Go seems to have a slightly modified OS than its predecessors.  My review was on a system running software version 5.7, while my PSP 3000 is updated to version 6.0.  In my opinion, there are small differences between the two versions, but most likely this is because the retractable controller affects the behavior of the device. <br>  For example, when Go is closed, the device enters standby mode, and a screensaver displaying an analog clock and date appears on the screen.  You can press both side buttons to enter the calendar menu and scroll through the months when you press R or L. When you open the device, you will be taken to the menu.  You can change the way PSP Go behaves when the screen is closed.  Instead of displaying the clock, you can send the device to sleep mode.  When playing a video, you can close Go and continue watching without a glitch.  (If you really want to turn off Go, you have to hold down the button for 3 seconds.) <br>  The only significant improvement in PSP Go firmware is the ability to pause the game and return to the menu.  During the game, when you click on the button with the PlayStation logo, in the lower left corner of the screen, a menu will appear similar to what appears when you press the Home button in older versions of the PSP.  By selecting ‚ÄúPause game‚Äù, you can pause the game for a long time, and then by clicking on ‚ÄúResume game‚Äù continue from the suspended moment. <br><br><h2>  Performance and battery life </h2><br>  Although there are some rumors that the PSP Go has acquired a faster chipset that can offer future performance benefits, I did not notice any noticeable differences with the PSP 3000 I currently had. Playing the digital version of Motorstorm: Arctic Edge, loading the game was almost identical on both devices. <br>  Moreover, the PSP as the iPhone has never stood out with a large battery charge.  And while the PSP Go uses the same battery as the PSP 2000 and PSP 3000, it is important to note that the user cannot change it on his own, which means that you can‚Äôt have 1 more battery left with you to replace it when discharged.  It seems that this was a deliberate step by Sony in the fight against piracy, since in previous PSP models it was possible to replace the battery. <br>  Sony claims that a full PSP Go battery should last between 3 and 6 hours during a game.  I managed to squeeze a little more than 5 hours in Motorstorm: Arctic Edge with brightness at the lowest level, and with a volume level of 25%.  Of course, your results may vary depending on the display settings.  I was hoping for a longer Go battery life in the closed state, but unfortunately, it is not very different from the PSP 3000. <br>  I also noticed that on previous PSP models, you can manually check the current battery charge status, but I still could not find this option in the PSP Go settings.  The option may appear in future firmware updates 5.7, although the current version of other PSP models is version 6.0. <br><br><h2>  Accessories </h2><br>  Included with the PSP Go, you get a charger, USB cable, Media Go software and instructions for use.  Unlike previous models, PSP Go does not provide a standard mini-USB port.  The place for this, everything must be connected through its own port: network adapter, USB cable, as well as the aforementioned PSP Go accessory - an AV cable that allows you to watch games and videos on the TV screen. <br>  Media Go's built-in software allows you to convert most video formats for playback on PSP Go and can rip audio CDs.  The program acts as an intermediary (like iTunes and iPod) between your computer and PSP Go.  (Many other programs, such as Format Factory, are also available for converting video in PSP format.) <br><br><img src="http://img519.imageshack.us/img519/4517/5555bx.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h1>  <b>Conclusion</b> </h1><br><h2>  Liked: </h2>  Elegant, slim design, 16 GB of internal memory, memory card slot, Bluetooth, good PS3 compatibility, easy access to several downloaded games without having to keep bulky UMDs at hand, the ability to pause and resume the game. <br><br><h2>  Did not like: </h2>  Expensive, despite the lack of a touch screen and a second analog., A smaller display size (but the same expansion is preserved), inconvenient placement of the joystick, no use of old PSP accessories, use of an obscure and expensive Memory Stick M2, non-replaceable battery, slow loading time "Games, online store is not very convenient (unlike, for example, from the App Store). <br><br><h2>  Conclusion: </h2>  PSP Go is a small and sexy toy with a new design, but its high price and some minor disappointments mean that there is no need to update your PSP. (At least for now). <br><br>  As I said in the introduction, the PSP Go is a bold move for Sony.  In terms of design, this model is the most compact of the PSP family.  And it is very attractive, although not without some flaws.  I will say this: you can either fall in love with this model or hate it (in terms of design).  However, its success will largely depend on the software that runs on it and on the number of game developers at Sony in order to produce more low-cost games with stunning graphics and take advantage of Go to the full. <br>  We still have to see what Sony will offer: PSP Mini services or additional nongaming applications, while it is difficult to make a final decision on switching to Go.  But for now, it's safe to say that this is a sexy toy for an overpriced $ 250.  And it remains a reality, because at the moment it is very difficult to get people to buy Go, which is limited in the number of games, and very few people will agree to this. <br>  Do not draw conclusions like: PSP Go is still under development.  Buy it if it blows your fancy, but make a conscious and thoughtful choice.  But it is worth remembering that in time it will cost much less, and it may be shifted by the new model. <br>  Although, if Sony now throws off the price for Go, I would recommend you to purchase PSP Go rather than PSP 3000. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/80136/">https://habr.com/ru/post/80136/</a></p>
