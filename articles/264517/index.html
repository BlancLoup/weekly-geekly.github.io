There is little specific mentality, ability to think in the abstract, well-developed logic, the main thing is to be aware that work is not only a way to make money.  Not many people meet all the conditions, and it is about this minority that will be discussed.  Before you - a collection of frank conversations with well-known programmers, system administrators and other "IT people."  The heroes of the book profess different views, belong to different social groups, can operate with millions of dollars, be the heroes of glamorous parties or simple office workaholic programmers.  Unites these people the ability to use their passion, passion and love for the profession as a lever to achieve fundamentally new heights in the development of themselves and their business.  We tried to find the brightest "stars" of the computer-networked subculture and convey to you the most diverse opinions, so that the reader, whatever his personal tastes, would not be bored with this colorful kaleidoscope of characters. <br><a name="habracut"></a>

      In the American business environment, there is a well-known and old as an assembler joke that the English word job (‚Äújob‚Äù) is actually an acronym, which stands for just over broke (‚Äúa little better than bankruptcy‚Äù).  Business likes to make fun of their employees, there's nothing you can do. <br>  Unfortunately, for most ordinary people, this is true - you need to live ‚Äúto pay your bills.‚Äù  There is nothing bad or shameful about this, besides the endless ‚Äúrat race‚Äù is liked by many ambitious and confident people of their youth.  These people are constantly in sight, seeking to achieve more, inject late into the day and are guided by the now popular strategy "grab and run."  The modus operandi for all this ‚Äúwhirlwind‚Äù is the ultimate and only compensation for all the effort spent, the opportunity to earn ‚Äúgood money‚Äù. <br>  If we speak in relation to the IT industry, which has recently seen a large flow of random people who have heard about the large salaries of IT people, this is a real disaster.  Such a casual person for the profession will look for workarounds and wonderful silver bullets in the form of powerful books and courses, having mastered which, it seems to him, he can become a true programmer in order to finally begin to row money with a shovel.  The bad news for IT-lost cowboys is that making a programmer‚Äôs career is much harder than just being one.  It will require a specific mindset, the rare gut of an introvert and the ability to think abstractly, a developed logical apparatus, and much more, including a cast-iron fifth point. <br><br>  <i>But what do we know about the minority that does otherwise?</i> <br><br>  It is about this "eccentric" minority and will be discussed in the book.  The interview heroes can practice different views and have different social statuses, be dollar millionaires, famous and public people, as well as simple office laborers, programmers, but they all have something in common.  Most of the interviews in the book are the stories of real IT people whose work is built on the principles of non-material motivation and denial of the already familiar motive of ‚Äúmaking money‚Äù as the central dominant of human activity. <br>  It is about using your dedication, passion and love for the profession as a lever to achieve fundamentally new heights in the development of yourself and your business (even if it is programming for hire).  In numerous interviews and life situations, I try to show with real examples: this motivation works against all odds and brings the joy of creativity into our office-plastic life. <br>  I did not rely on communicating exclusively with famous people (although a couple of heroes from the list are certainly world famous), but I tried to select interlocutors according to their degree of ‚Äúgeekiness‚Äù and ‚Äúdriving‚Äù, so that through their inspiring example make the reader at least think about how the maximum is to look at the familiar IT world with other eyes, thereby prompting one to rise to a qualitatively different level of one‚Äôs professional growth, firmly riding the ‚Äújust for fun‚Äù formula. <br><br><h5>  What was this book written for? </h5><br>  With a huge amount of motivational literature, which quite successfully pedals the theme of a positive way of thinking, in Russia there is practically no similar book entirely devoted to IT.  I am amazed that with today's number of success stories, it is in the field of IT, where many IT Jedi change countries and companies like gloves (earning millions of dollars along the way), they still have not become heroes of epic books telling about their first-hand adventures (a few success stories of Durov, Zukenberg and Jobs figures of caliber do not count).  Despite the huge interest in the sub-culture of "ah-ti", primarily from the youth, there is not even an attempt to give the floor to an ordinary computer programmer, and this despite the fact that the success of modern IT people among the people has already become the talk of the town, and the profession of the "accomplished programmer" gives a touch of elitism. <br>  The second aspect of any motivational literature (except for the correction of the habitual way of thinking to a new and ‚Äúsuccessful‚Äù by attracting vivid examples of destinies) is an emphasis on action.  And this book is no exception - it contains a lot of practical tips on interviewing and finding effective development vectors packed in an informal, everyday format: ‚Äútips from IT people for IT people‚Äù (part II is mainly devoted to this). <br>  In conclusion of this introduction, as the main conclusion of the book, I would like to wish the reader the following: realize your interest, perfectionism or excitement with maximum benefit, while the fixed idea, as they say, ‚Äúburns‚Äù, and youth allows you to ‚Äúmove mountains‚Äù while working around the clock mode.  It is the sincere passion and unrestrained enthusiasm that become the very ‚Äúcritical mass‚Äù that allows the miracle to happen in your life. <br><br><h5>  about the author </h5><br>  Having completed his studies in the special class of English, Igor Savchuk graduated from the Physics and Mathematics Department and served in the Airborne Forces.  He worked as a programmer for more than 9 years, in recent years he worked as a ‚Äúsystem administrator with extended powers‚Äù ‚Äã‚Äã(DevOps).  Currently, leaving programming in the past, working as an IT journalist and blogger.  His author's "tehnoblog" was one of the Top-100 of the most popular standalone blogs of Runet according to the version of Yandex Blogs rating. <br><br>  More information about the book can be found on <a href="http://www.piter.com/collection/biblioteka-programmista/product/otyavlennyy-programmist-layfhaking-iz-pervyh-ruk">the publisher's website.</a> <br>  <a href="http://storage.piter.com/upload/contents/978549601806/978549601806_X.pdf">Table of contents</a> <br>  <a href="http://storage.piter.com/upload/contents/978549601806/978549601806_p.pdf">Excerpt</a> <br><br>  For Habrozhiteley a 25% discount on the coupon - <b>Programmer</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/264517/">https://habr.com/ru/post/264517/</a></p>
