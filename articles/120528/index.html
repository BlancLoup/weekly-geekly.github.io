  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Write primarily under platforms that are popular in the United States, and do not waste your strength on the rest</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Good day, <br>  I was approached by a novice mobile developer asking for advice on which mobile platform is better to do.  I decided to publish my advice, can anyone else help. <br>  My advice is this: <b>write first of all for those platforms that are popular in the US and do not spend your strength on the rest</b> . <br>  Why? <a name="habracut"></a><br>  Because Americans are accustomed to pay for everything.  And they pay.  In addition, Americans believe in advertising and therefore I click well on banner ads, which can also bring good income. <br>  And I also like Americans because they are very grateful people.  Even if they are dissatisfied, they are not offensive in the case (I judge it from my own experience, I have published the application 250+ Solitaires Collection on the market). <br>  Europeans are more pragmatic, a European will think several times before buying something.  From my own experience I can say that in Europe it is best to buy applications in France and Germany, a little worse in the UK. <br>  In the US, of course, popular iOS and Android.  Blackberry is still popular, but it has recently significantly passed and improvements have not yet been foreseen. <br>  I work for the American company PSA (we have management in the USA, and all the developers are in Belarus).  I participate in the evaluation of all orders for mobile development and I can judge the mood in the US mobile development market. <br>  So, corporate customers, for their internal services, are interested in iOS (primarily iPad) and Android, sometimes Blackberry, but less and less.  Just do not think that in American corporations use iOS and Android entirely.  On the contrary, services for iOS and Android are still not widely used.  This sector is very conservative and does not pursue fashion.  But for new projects, it is still iOS and Android that is most often chosen. <br>  Notice I'm writing iOS and Android everywhere, not iOS or Android.  This means that, as a rule, the customer wants a version for both iOS and Android.  In this case, recently the emphasis is on tablets. <br>  The second type of customers are those who order the development of programs for sale.  Here orders can be divided into two types: <br>  1) Porting to Android (sometimes even Blackberry) iOS applications.  These are the most difficult customers, as they almost always want iOS applications to be transferred one to one, and we have to prove for a long time that the application should not look alien on Android, that the menu does not need the ‚ÄúCancel‚Äù button, etc.) <br>  2) Developing programs for iOS and Android (note again ‚Äúand‚Äù, not ‚Äúor‚Äù) and, again, sometimes for Blackberry. <br>  Now about other platforms.  At this time, none of the American customers are not interested in either Windows Phone 7, or Symbian, or Bada, or WebOS. <br>  If everything is clear with the last three, then I would like to express my opinion about Windows Phone 7.  Apologists for this system say that Android was also not popular at first, and then turned around and also will be with WP7.  However, the experience of the company in which I work, says the opposite.  The first customer for Android appeared before the release of the T-mobile G1 (for the young, this is the first android), the second customer ‚Äî a month after its release.  In the first case, it was a startup, and in the second, a large corporate customer.  Although it must be admitted that at first there were not many applications for development and significant growth began only after the release of the Motorola Droid.  But there no less American customers showed interest in Android as soon as Google announced it. <br>  With WP7, the situation is completely different.  Already 8 months sold a number of models of WP7.  But not a single one of our current customers or new ones showed interest in it. <br>  WP7 apologists also say that the Nokia WP7 will release a smartphone and then ... And then nothing will change in the US anyway.  Nokia's perception of the Nokia brand is zero, the market share is a fraction of a percent.  Nokia can help Microsoft in other countries around the world, but not in the United States. <br>  WP7 is not popular in the US, so don‚Äôt waste your time on it. <br>  Choose iOS or Android.  And you will be a sought-after specialist and, if luck smiles, you can earn good money. </div>
