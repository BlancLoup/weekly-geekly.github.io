  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Take the keyboard, take a sledgehammer ...</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Once upon a time I read on Habr√© a note about the Logitech keyboard Illuminated Keyboard.  Due to the fact that I like laptop notebooks, and besides, I often have to do something at night, this keyboard was just the perfect solution to the problems.  Not only is it well illuminated, it also turns out that its edging is metallic.  Ie the keyboard is pretty heavy.  She does not crawl on the table, which is very convenient.  Although something I got carried away.  The point is not that at all. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So I bought this miracle of technology.  There was only one minus - both alphabets are white.  But you get used to it.  Damn ... again suffered. <br><br>  In short, after half a year, the glitch went.  The keys began to turn off. (Do not be surprised if these letters are not everywhere in the text) And the most annoying that these were the right keys.  Ctrl, D, F, I, C, Y  Those.  completely suddenly they stopped working and also suddenly started working again. <br><br>  At first, like a real Jedi, I tried to solve the problem myself.  Sinned on the power supply, such as not enough power on USB2.  I changed draver.  Even I put the clave in all the computers, up to the laptops, in my apartment.  Everything was repeated on all computers.  At some point, the keys are turned off.

      And now the time has come when you need to do what any Pindos would do in the first place - to call the manufacturer's support.  I crossed myself, prepared myself for an erotic walk, and called. <br>  In view of the fact that I often had to communicate with the Melkomyagkie saport, I was not surprised that a person with a strong accent spoke to me and who really experienced my problem with me.  The wonderful girl Katarzyna Debska listened to me attentively, wrote down all my complaints, gave me the client number, explained to me that this product has a 3 year warranty and I can‚Äôt worry about replacing it.  After a half-hour conversation, we decided this: I will try to change the clave and the seller, and if that doesn't work, then I can contact them directly.  Whereupon and say goodbye. <br><br>  I called the seller where I was naturally sent, referring to the fact that "this is a technically complex product and it is dear to you at the Logtech representative office."  Well, okay.  Why rush it.  I will address.  Time is another 2.5 years.  But logiteki pushed me. <br><br>  Just a week later, I get soap: <br><blockquote>  You did not receive a response regarding your request for support within 168 hours from the time you sent your answer.  Thus, the status of your question has been changed to "ELIMINATED". </blockquote><br><br>  OPA!  Here I did not understand humor a bit and foolishly replied to this letter: <br><blockquote>  No problem is solved.  The online store that has sold your keyboard to me does not want me to change it at all.  Sends to you, and you are the opposite to them.  And what should I do now?  The problem so periodically appears.  The D, F, S, I and Ctrl keys are disabled. </blockquote><br><br>  Honestly, I did not expect an answer.  Because  I sent this text at 21.12 SK. <br>  But it was not there. <br><br>  At 22.15 I receive the first letter: <br><blockquote>  Created an account with the following user code and password ... </blockquote><br>  And the next day at 12.15 the following: <br><blockquote>  You have sent a request for assistance on an individual basis from our online support center.  Below is a summary of your request and our response. <br>  If you have not received a response within 7 days, it is considered that your problem has been resolved. <br>  Thank you for letting us provide you with our services. </blockquote><br><br>  And then the song ... <br><blockquote>  Dear Alexander, <br><br>  Thank you for using the Logitech Electronic Technical Support. <br><br>  This case is a warranty.  Keyboard Illuminated Keyboard has 3 years manufacturer's warranty. <br>  If the store refuses your warranty service, and you have kept the purchase documents, we can change the keyboard as part of the technical support <br><br>  You need to do the following: <br><br>  On a A4 sheet of paper, write with a handwriter number the client number xxxxxx-xxxxxxx, put a keyboard on this sheet so that the client number is visible. <br>  On the documents of the purchase you write with a handwriter marker the number of the client xxxxxx-xxxxxxx. <br><br>  Take photos, send them to us and call us back phone +7 495 641 3460 <br><br>  <b><u>Burste keyboard, burste sledgehammer or equivalent tool, and with its help bring the keyboard into a non-working state.</u></b> <b><u><br><br></u></b>  <b><u>Bc what remains with the help of a brush and a scoop transfer to an existing A4 sheet of paper with the client number, so that the client number is visible.</u></b> <br><br>  Take a photo, send it to us and call us back phone +7 495 641 3460 <br><br>  After receiving the photos we will send you the Illuminated Keyboard Keyboard. <br>  <b><u>This is the only way to change the keyboard.</u></b> <br><br>  Please send your exact address with an index and mobile number. <br><br>  If you have any other questions please contact us. <br>  For more information about your product, we invite you to visit our website on <a href="http://www.logitech.ru/">www.logitech.ru</a> or contact us by phone +7 495 641 3460 <br><br>  If within 7 days you have not received an answer, your status will change to "ELIMINATED". <br>  The survey will be sent to you as soon as the status changes to "ELIMINATED". <br>  Please share with us your impressions after contacting Logitech Technical Support, this information will help us better understand your needs and improve our quality of services. <br><br>  respectfully <br>  Katarzyna D bska <br>  Logitech Europe SA <br>  European Customer Support </blockquote><br><br>  And now here I am sitting and thinking, and can I really ask them for the herbs that they smoked?  Because according to the Russian legislation, they have to change the ‚Äúwhole‚Äù product for the same to me only working.  Klava beat hammer pipets as a pity, and dumb.  Knowing Russian validity, I would send nafig after such photos.  Although the method itself is entertaining. <br><br>  <b>What do you think to beat or not to beat?</b> <br>  In principle, I wrote to them that I would not beat, because in that case I would have nothing to work with. <br>  If interested, I can continue the story of how this will end. <br>  Thanks for taking out :-) <br><br>  PS: I apologize in advance for the errors, if they are present, and the non-harmonious syllable.  Because I still have no neighbors and I do not know what to do. <br><br>  UPD: Transferred to techsapport. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/68179/">https://habr.com/ru/post/68179/</a></p>
