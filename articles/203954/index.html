  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Review of the registrar AdvoCam-FD5S Profi-GPS: "witness" with a 3-inch screen and wide-angle optics</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  About a month ago, the brand AdvoCam updated the line of recorders, it released three models - FD5S Profi-GPS, FD6S and FD7S.  All three have already visited me, so I would like to consistently share my impressions, I will start with AdvoCam-FD5S Profi-GPS.  I think the "predecessor" in the face of AdvoCam-FD5 Profi-GPS is familiar to many motorists who are faced with the question of choosing a registrar.  At the time of release the model looked very attractive.  Now the requested 7,490 rubles (~ $ 234) seem to be somewhat overpriced, since the new AdvoCam-FD7 with Ambarella A7 and (so-called) Super Full HD costs 7,090 rubles (~ $ 221). <br><br>  I am attaching KDPV.  Interested (in the registrar) invite under the cat. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a3b/fbf/c80/a3bfbfc8052b6eed64630f7b7261dfbd.jpg"><a name="habracut"></a>

    <h4>  Meet on clothes </h4><br>  The boxes of the two recorders are standard, made of thick cardboard, with good printing. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0bc/460/a32/0bc460a322399c64b49cda4c7793f9ff.jpg"><br><br>  The new design of the AdvoCam recorder packs is more appealing to me, since a jumble of different colors and fonts is more appropriate to look on an advertising poster. <br><br>  What you liked especially - with more, if this is your second registrar, you will not have to open the instructions.  Aspects of model management are painted on the back of the box.  However, AdvoCam-FD5 has the same explanations, only on the side of the package. <br><br>  On the box with AdvoCam-FD5S Profi-GPS there is a sticker indicating sympathy for the registrars of the brand Viktor Travin, president of the board of legal protection for car owners.  I‚Äôll say right away that a brochure is attached to the registrar, in which Travin explains the procedure for using the recorder‚Äôs video in the event of an accident.  It is clear that the same tips Travin can be viewed on YouTube, but not all motorists and the Internet somehow know how to use. <br><br>  The configurations are almost identical: exactly the same long power cords (4 meters), very similar vacuum suction attachments.  The slight difference is that the AdvoCam-FD5‚Äôs external GPS antenna is removable and, in the AdvoCam-FD5S, is built into the mount.  I see no reason why the GPS module should be withdrawn, so I think the second option is more logical. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8fa/f23/79b/8faf2379ba22c05ac11cab4bccc63566.jpg"><br><br>  The materials of the device's case are similar, in both cases there is soft touch plastic.  Only in AdvoCam-FD5S it is diluted with a glossy insert covering the right / left ends and the area around the screen. <br><br>  One of the main differences between the models is the diagonal of the screen; for AdvoCam-FD5S, it has grown from 2.7 inches to three.  This is mainly reflected in the height, in comparison with its predecessor, this parameter for the model has grown from 32 mm to 52.8 mm.  But AdvoCam-FD5S slightly decreased in length and "lost" almost "ten" to 71.5 grams. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5a4/45a/56e/5a445a56e3c74be46dfabc05abb2b503.jpg"><br><br>  In terms of management, working with AdvoCam-FD5S looks simpler, the number of buttons has been reduced from six to four.  Saved quick access to popular features - control of sound, backlight, emergency mark of the file, menu and instant photo.  The buttons are located on the top and right ends.  Thus, space was saved on the sides of the screen. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/34f/2c8/431/34f2c8431fa479e3aefa4e8e4c5fabe0.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bd2/fcd/d73/bd2fcdd734333c22090f220d4cd1af4d.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/54d/f77/407/54df7740718db2e8e76bd54b567c27ad.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c43/6e2/49c/c436e249c5bbe571aad1c350a129ee1c.jpg"><br><br>  Separately, it should be noted hinged bracket.  This mounting option is used in all AdvoCam models, and in the registrars of other brands, it is now regularly encountered. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/85a/860/c81/85a860c819a64f81b90227f6bec01af4.jpg"><br><br>  Plus number one is compactness; at the expense of an extremely short leg, the holder with the recorder forms the most compact design.  Plus number two is a hinge, with which the camera position is adjusted quickly and conveniently.  All sorts of screw options still seem to me archaism.  Plus, if you have a AdvoCam-FD5S hinge, you can turn to the side without any problems in an instant.  That will never be superfluous when communicating with the inspector.  Plus number three - power through the bracket.  Since the recorder is removed / installed faster, you do not need to connect the cable every time.  And it is even better if it is completely powered from the ceiling. <br><br><h4>  Check by Record </h4><br>  AdvoCam-FD5 shoots video with a viewing angle of 120 degrees, whereas AdvoCam-FD5S - 170 degrees, which gives a small fish-eye effect, however, it is not very noticeable when watching videos.  In the end, we are not shooting a film, but the most informative video material with an eye to use in court.  I recently reviewed a selection of lovers to jump sharply under the wheels and portray a downed pedestrian - once again questions about the relevance of wide viewing angles of the recorder have disappeared. <br><br>  By the way, a microSD memory card with a capacity of 4 GB is attached to both recorders in the kit, which is enough for approximately 40 minutes of Full HD shooting.  In my opinion, with cyclic shooting of files for 3 minutes (options for 1 or 5 minutes are also available) this is quite enough.  As a rule, the entire episode with an accident in extreme cases takes 2-3 minutes.  If anything, the recording will continue due to the built-in 130 mAh battery.  Well, how it will continue - just one minute, exactly for the correct completion of the recording in an emergency. <br><br>  I‚Äôll add that I got the test AdvoCam-FD5 without a memory card, and I decided to insert a 2 GB card found on the shelf by chance.  The result was intermittent shooting due to low write speed.  The manufacturer specifically states that the memory card should not be a class 4 niche, and puts into the box the ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù e 4 GB cards. <br><br>  Now about the video.  The AdvoCam-FD5S is equipped with a 3 megapixel matrix of 1/3 "size, manufactured by Aptina. The lens is 5-lens, of course, glass. With a processor, the following situation is indicated by the SunPlus brand, but it is not clear what model it is. AdvoCam-FD5S‚Äôs path from analog to digital is initially favorable to good quality regardless of weather and time of day. Files are recorded at a high variable bit rate of 12-13.4 Mbps. Alas, the weather didn‚Äôt work from the first days of autumn, because the shooting was carried out exclusively in conditions  high clouds and "gloomy" clouds. I would not mind a little increased exposure, though, and so the picture is good, the real distance readability rates reached up to ten meters. I suspect that on a clear sunny day, you can easily add another five meters. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/prue7qdfz1s%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700043,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700255&amp;usg=ALkJrhj00BYzOFUrbyRZXbyoZyDe4jq7PQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/-bYYtzB_SpA%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700043,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700255&amp;usg=ALkJrhiHSZD8HE5qM19Fpj8zyA_uMEFIDg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  I liked the night recordings by the almost complete absence of ‚Äústars‚Äù from headlights and lanterns, and in general, the contrast and color rendition left a positive impression.  If the digital noise is smaller - it would be quite cool.  When viewing numbers, the situation is standard, there are many lubrications, but they are typical in such conditions for almost any registrar.  Specifically, in the given example, AdvoCam-FD5S clearly showed the numbers of almost all passing cars. <br><br>  Just in case, I will give a head-on comparison of the night shooting AdvoCam-FD5S and AdvoCam-FD5. <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/oI3Bgi8abgA%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700043,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700255&amp;usg=ALkJrhgqzAoVFluDMLNnmZaeurX6N9CSKw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/4ao0mmB98zw%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700043,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700255&amp;usg=ALkJrhidJl2IvWqItsTDoBTIegHnYjTOFA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Overall, I did not notice a serious difference in the quality of the AdvoCam-FD5 and AdvoCam-FD5S recordings. <br><br>  PS A few words about useful "buns".  In the presence of an accelerometer, eight levels of sensitivity are available.  GPS, as it should be, records the movement coordinates for later viewing of the route on Google maps.  The complete disk has a player for viewing video, maps and data from the accelerometer.  Stamps on top of the video - date, time, coordinates, speed and registration number.  There is a motion sensor (not the one that is a G-sensor), and with it a parking mode with shooting when moving objects are detected in the frame.  The thing is useful and has repeatedly helped citizens catch criminals. <br><br><h4>  Escorted by the mind </h4><br>  I can‚Äôt say that AdvoCam-FD5S is some kind of innovative recorder, but nowadays it‚Äôs not easy to find a simple ‚Äúhard worker‚Äù for shooting.  In the plus model, first of all, I will write down the stable operation, the loss of files or unreadable content, no GPS ‚Äúglitches‚Äù were noticed.  For a set of functions there is a complete "stuffing" - and the accelerometer, and GPS, and parking shooting are included.  When compared to its predecessor, AdvoCam-FD5S has gotten a larger 3-inch screen (instead of 2.7 inches) and a 170-degree viewing angle (against 120 degrees).  Significant deficiencies could not be found, only depressed battery life depresses.  It is clear that there are models for 10,000 rubles without a battery at all, but nonetheless.  The price of the issue is 5,490 rubles (~ $ 171), the version without GPS is slightly cheaper - 4,590 rubles (~ $ 143). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/45f/f9a/44a/45ff9a44a9bd8a40c7c25921b27ba21c.jpg"><br><br>  PS I still do not lose hope that I will be able to get to the factory of the ByteErg company (owner of AdvoCam) in the city of Aleksandrov (Vladimir region) and talk about how registrars are developing, as well as carry out quality checks on finished lots. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/203954/">https://habr.com/ru/post/203954/</a></p>
