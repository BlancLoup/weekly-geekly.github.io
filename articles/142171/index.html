  <section class="page js-page"><h1>StartUp Sabantuy! - new IT park project</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Kazan IT Park with the participation of the investment fund Runa Capital announces the launch of a new project - StartUp Sabantuy!  From mid-May to mid-June this year, a team of experts from Kazan IT-Park will travel through all the capitals of the Volga Federal District (13 cities - Izhevsk, Yoshkar-Olu, Cheboksary, Nizhny Novgorod, Saransk, Penza, Samara, Ulyanovsk, Kirov, Perm, Ufa, Orenburg, Saratov) in search of promising IT startups. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7e7/f70/7df/7e7f707dfa9fd5374db0be7de9143f0e.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Elevator pitches will be held in each city, following the project the winners will receive invitations to the <a href="http://binkubator.timepad.ru/event/21549">final DemoDay</a> in <a href="http://itpark-kazan.ru/">Kazan IT Park</a> , where they will be evaluated by specially invited experts, they are also potential investors: representatives of large investment funds are numerous friends and partners of IT Park First of all, experts of the fund Runa Capital. <br>  Ramil Ibrahimov, Deputy Director of IT Park (curator of the Business Incubator): ‚ÄúOn Friday, April 13 of this year, the 6th selection for the right to place in the IT Park Business Incubator took place, which was attended by 117 projects from 13 cities of Russia and Of Ukraine: Moscow, St. Petersburg, Kiev, Donetsk, Yekaterinburg, Nizhny Novgorod, Orenburg, Izhevsk, Ulyanovsk, Yoshkar-Ola, Kazan and Naberezhnye Chelny.  The interest in the IT park is high, and we decided to take a proactive stance and go to the regions ourselves to find interesting projects that could successfully join the IT ecosystem of Tatarstan. <br>  We already have a number of positive examples - the same Real Speaker - a project from Yoshkar-Ola, which, being in the IT business incubator with a very raw project, just six months with our help made a huge leap forward: became a Skolkovo resident, won in several competitions, won a number of grants, initiated a procedure for obtaining a patent in the United States, received extensive expert support from a significant number of mentors representing the world's leading investment funds, currently negotiations with the potential  th investor, plus the entire decision of the expert commission of the project was among the first 10 startups that Kazan IT-Park in May this year sends a technological internship in Silicon Valley.  The task minimum for the project StartUp Sabantuy!  - Find 13 such Real Speakers: one in each city.  Plus, we are eager to share with our neighbors our experience in creating a fully functioning IT ecosystem. ‚Äù <br>  In some cities, colleagues from the Runa Capital investment fund will join the team of IT park experts.  This is not the first project where the interests of IT Park and Runa Capital coincide.  In March of this year, Kazan hosted a forum of heads of 22 leading global investment funds with a total portfolio of managed assets in the IT industry of over $ 20 billion. <a href="http://itpark-kazan.ru/ru/node/528">Runa VC off-site meeting</a> , initiated by Runa Capital.  The resident of the IT Park Business Incubator is the Ulyanovsk startup Ecwid, in which Runa Capital recently invested $ 1.5 million. Experts of the Runa Capital Foundation regularly provide expert support to Kazan startups. <br>  Ramil Ibragimov: ‚ÄúFor many, the name of the project is StartUp Sabantuy!  - can cause a smile.  In choosing the name, we focused on our Finnish friends from <a href="http://aaltovg.com/">Aalto Venture Garage</a> - the creators of the project <a href="http://startupsauna.com/">StartUpSauna</a> .  They chose ‚Äúsauna‚Äù as the most famous Finnish brand in the world.  What is associated with Tatarstan better than Sabantuy?  Plus Sabantuy itself is a great holiday that every year the Tatars, who live all over the world, are eagerly awaiting. <br>  By the way, we are planning to hold our DemoDay right on the eve of the real Sabantuy, which will be held in Kazan at the end of June, and we will definitely have a real holiday for the project participants so that those who come to us can appreciate not only the IT ecosystem, but and understand that Tatarstan is a great place to live.  By the way, our friends from Aalto Venture Garage are seriously interested in the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãholding StartUp Sabantuy!  and we are ready to invite the 3 strongest projects that will be interviewed by their experts to the Aalto Venture Garage business incubator for a 6-week intensive course in Helsinki. <br>  By the way, Finns also send the best projects from their intensives to Silicon Valley, so the potential winners of StartUp Sabantuy!  the chances of being in Silicon Valley are doubled. ‚Äù <br>  StartUp Sabantuy!  starts on May 11 in Izhevsk.
