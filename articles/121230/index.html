Under the cat information about glasses, types, a review of several frames and information about the RX-program. <h6>  In parallel with the discussion of this article, the user <a href="https://geektimes.ru/users/rroyter/" class="user_link">rroyter</a> from the United States, <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/gadgets/121852/">took up his own testing of</a> GunnarOptiks points. </h6><h6><a name="habracut"></a><br></h6><h1>  Review of points on the example of models Edge and Wi-Five </h1><br><h6>  The overlooked samples were purchased last year at different times and in different stores.  All accompanying materials were filmed yesterday and today. </h6><br><br>  After I became convinced of the desire to buy glasses, the problem grew before me: <i>- "How not to be mistaken with the choice of frame, because the rim is a purely individual accessory?"</i> .  On the one hand, I wanted to give up thinking <i>- ‚ÄúIf I don‚Äôt guess, I‚Äôll wear them only when I work on a PC</i> . <i>‚Äù</i>  But the total amount of the order in ~ 4500r.  evaporated this lightheadedness. <br>  At that time, I focused only on the official store, and on the reviews, most of which people surveyed without EDGE.  Their form suited me perfectly, and the lack of a rim around the lenses made them unusual.  But I never wore such a frame, so I printed out all the necessary sizes, walked through the thicket of an urban optician, trying to find something similar.  It took about three days to search, since in most cases the same ones are sold in all optics.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/ca9ed1e5/ff29611d/f20b9222/d24314df.jpg"><br><br>  In my case, the nameless setting costing 1,800 rubles was approximately similar.  I took a few photos for a fitting and showed them to friends and a girl who approved the form. <br><br><h2>  Shops, purchase, delivery </h2><br>  Taking Visa Classic, opening the coveted <a href="http://www.gunnars.com/shop/cart.php">Online Store</a> , I chose the model I needed and came across the ‚ÄúOUT OF STOCK‚Äù banner.  All attempts to choose something else were also unsuccessful, even practical <b>Wi-Five</b> were sold out.  And then I started picking up the list of retailers, and to my surprise I found out that from the entire list (all geographically located in the USA), only two provided international shipping.  These are <a href="http://www.framesdirect.com/">FramesDirect.com</a> and <a href="https://www.thinkgeek.com/">ThinkGeek.com</a> .  <b>FramesDirect</b> also had neither <b>EDGE</b> nor <b>Wi-Five,</b> but <b>Halogen, which</b> cost 200 USD, I could not afford.  And then I placed an order on the <b>ThinkGeek</b> website.  But even there it wasn‚Äôt a problem.  First, they have a manual verification of the cards during the first registration, and they process the answers for several days.  Constantly demanding a photo of the last digits from the card, then a closed card with your fingers against the background of the holder‚Äôs documents.  The second problem was the inability to deliver goods to a private address. <br><blockquote>  Our address will not be shipping.  Honestly, it‚Äôs not a problem.  You can‚Äôt get it shipped to Russia </blockquote><br>  With grief in half, having spent about a week, my order went to processing.  Delivery was made by <b>UPS Express</b> , but in fairness, I note that the cherished white box turned out to be with me in just 5 days.  She was well packaged in a triple layer of bubble polyethylene. <br><br>  In the box were: Themselves glasses on the stand;  - White bag for carrying and wiping glasses;  - Gunnars logo sticker and coupon for free download of 1 songs from iTunes. <br><br>  Although I was hoping to get a bigger box, what suppliers are guided by and what it depends on in which package the glasses will be, I have not figured out.  But for reference, there are about 4 options. <br><br>  1. A big black box with a technology book, a compact disc, a plastic case and a special recess in the shape of glasses. <br>  2. Plastic transparent or black small box / case. <br>  3. Plain white cardboard packaging like me and all friends and acquaintances. <br>  4. In the usual bag. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/0802a872/cf0db3ea/d929e5fe/c1253ecc.jpg"><br><br>  Literally in a few months, based on my impressions about the glasses, my friend also decided to buy glasses for himself.  The second purchase was also a creak: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/a585f625/4611fe62/59171be6/190c7206.jpg"><br><br>  First, <b>ThinkGeek no longer worked with Russia</b> , Ukraine was on the list of the nearest country. <br>  Secondly, <b>FramesDirect</b> spent a long time confirming the credit card, ~ 3-4 days.  Then it turned out that the <b>Wi-Five</b> for which the choice fell, are not in stock.  after much deliberation, we again returned to the official store.  On the official website, the delivery is no longer <b>UPS and FEDEX Interational is</b> not 45 as we expected, but 50 USD.  The points themselves were worth a good $ 20 more than retailers.  Total total amount was 175 USD, but there was not enough money on the card.  And the inquisitive Russian mind got into the Internet for information as if to cut costs. <br><br>  The solution was very simple: <br><blockquote>  1. Google.com <br>  2. <i>Gunnar.com promo code</i> <br>  During the search, codes on FramesDirect were also found. </blockquote><br>  Thus, we won back $ 25 and returned to the original amount of $ 150. <br><br>  Delivery as the first time was carried out fairly quickly, within a week.  And we got our hands on brand new <b>Wi-Five</b> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/4ace5d12/c0854d2f/0c748528/5e8acb97.jpg"><br><br><h2>  Review and impressions * </h2><br>  The first thought that comes to mind is not the quality check of the assembly and assembly, but the desire to put on these wonder-glasses and see for what money was given. <br><br>  <a href="">The picture is clickable</a> <a href=""><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/4f633636/72ae5035/3e6fb40c/1e3d1eab.jpg"></a> <br><br>  <b>And so, impressions:</b> <br>  - no effect <br>  - Terrible disorientation, <br>  - Everything is unusually yellow, sharp and confusing. <br>  I immediately doubted the ability to work with flowers, but I remembered that such a reaction of the eyes and the body is absolutely normal.  You just need to get used to and give the brain to adapt to new conditions and increased contrast.  In the end, this is what happens, in half an hour - an hour, you forget that you are wearing glasses, your eyes get used to it, adjust the ‚Äúwhite balance‚Äù, and everything returns to normal.  The glasses turned out so light that at first I tried to put on my usual glasses over Gunnars, and even tried to rub my eyes through the glasses several times, not to mention falling asleep in them. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/fb145e75/4e4e090f/0564a0e2/80988aff.jpg"><br><br>  I don‚Äôt know the weight of the glasses, but they are so light that they don‚Äôt show themselves, in other matters, any pressure on the ears, or the bridge of the nose.  To understand how easy they are I can only say that putting the glasses on the table can be blown away without effort.  But at the same time they are quite tight to the head due to the flexibility of the arms. <br><br>  The arms are made of durable but flexible plastic, to the touch ‚ÄúSoft touch‚Äù.  They bend strongly enough, but take on their original appearance - accidentally breaking them is quite difficult, but the strength of the nose bridge is in doubt.  Most likely, if you accidentally sit on them, the glasses will break just in the region of the nose bridge. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/65d48b3c/1b94425c/cbf88696/c0033772.jpg"><br><br>  The lenses of the glasses have some approximating effect, despite the fact that they are not diopter, but the medium is visually still closer.  This functionality is surely appreciated by people with myopia to -0.5, who do not want to wear glasses.  I, in turn, bought glasses for contact lenses.  and for a very long time I got used to such a way of life, - to put on lenses, to put on glasses, and at first I was confused, because in my entire life I was used to wear only glasses.  In the end, I'm used to it, but the desire to buy Gunnars from RX retailers still does not leave me.  Although such an acquisition with lenses from Carl Zeiss raises the cost of glasses up to 300 cu, and in Russia there are no such laboratories. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/b3ae9d6c/6da13190/48056234/58961311.jpg"><br><br>  Further more, literally in the first two weeks, I began to notice that I could read the text of both books and from the iPhone longer than I could have done without efforts before.  The increased clarity of perception really takes place, and already a month later I was experiencing discomfort being in lenses without these glasses, or working in old glasses without having time to wear lenses in the morning. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/f2989fcd/4d54987c/3b567fc4/c5435c93.jpg"><br><br>  The most significant for me is still morning: if I wake up and immediately go to the PC, I feel a burning sensation in my eyes, before I needed time to wake up and get used to it, now it‚Äôs enough just to wear glasses. <br><br>  <b>The microclimate</b> about which it was told earlier also takes place to be.  and I noticed this with the acquisition of lenses: Without glasses, the eyes get very tired and dry in the evening, because the air and the wind dry the eyes, and the natural moisturizing of the eyes is complicated by the presence of contact lenses.  Putting on contact lenses with these glasses, I walk in lenses without removing them for <b>up to 4 days</b> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/9ba6a1b5/43ddee63/2e4d799e/dcc32d23.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Scratches:</b> <br>  As for the scratches, they are simply not present either on the first or the second pair of glasses so far.  The weak point of Gunnars EDGE, I would note the place of attachment of the handle-lens.  They often clog up the dust, which is difficult to wipe without cotton buds, the lack of doubtful but against the backdrop of clean lenses, rather annoying the fact of its presence. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/90aaca9f/6311cb78/c709e8bf/3f1ecdcd.jpg"><br><br>  In the case of <b>Wi-Five, the</b> lack is also more likely a nagging: there are traces of dirty / greasy fingers on the nose from the outside, and create the impression of a metal rubbing.  But all this is erased with a cloth without any effort. <br><br>  <b>Water.</b> <br>  Nobody called water-repellent lens coatings, although sometimes this is just not enough.  Of course, there are drops, but they are much smaller in comparison with drops on ordinary glasses.  The lenses sweat from sudden changes in temperature, but quickly return to normal.  There were no divorces after the rain. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/af113ac8/57d980af/28e91629/837876c6.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Traces:</b> <br>  In spite of all the coatings and the absence of smears of fingerprints, depending on the intensity of wearing, if you take them off often, you will still need a rag just in case.  If you wear it in the morning and take it off before going to bed, then with this use you will not have to wipe them more than once every two or three days. <br><br>  <b>And in the end I will answer the most important question:</b> <br>  Yes, glasses relieved of visual loads, increased productivity and visual acuity.  They have become indispensable, and at the first opportunity I will get myself a second pair with the RX.  to get rid of contact lenses. <br><br><h2>  Comments </h2><br>  1. In the article to a greater extent, I considered my <b>EDGE</b> frame (on the left), and used <b>Wi-Five</b> (on the right) for comparison.  They have identical lens properties.  The owner of Wi-Five has no problems with vision. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/3b75748e/dbb49b52/6d7fbf27/654f8eaf.jpg"><br><br>  4. Black photos taken without using Photoshop - this is the effect of the lenses themselves and reflections.  The photos were taken in a dark bathroom, against the background of a black fabric, using the usual b / w pattern in Corel, and the underside of the back screen of the laptop on which this pattern was opened. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/b784172e/df293244/70032c54/8819c52a.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Cameras:</b> Sony CyberShot and Apple iPhone <br><br>  <b>UPD:</b> If you think that the whole thing is not specifically in the manufacturer and the usual yellow filter.  Then pay attention to the possibility of buying absolutely transparent glasses with the same characteristics, designed for designers <br><br><img src="http://=&quot;http://habrastorage.org/storage/5d19e511/96346728/6c2d6eed/2ce39b0c.jpg&quot;"><br><br>  <b>UPD1:</b> Habraphoser <a href="https://geektimes.ru/users/abyss/" class="user_link">abyss</a> , also advised to use the program <a href="http://stereopsis.com/flux/">f.lux ‚Ñ¢</a> with action similar to the points surveyed.  Maybe someone will come in handy. <br><br>  <b>UPD2:</b> EugeneGavrin <a href="https://geektimes.ru/users/eugenegavrin/" class="user_link">has</a> found out that there is a possibility of ordering points by the RX program, with delivery to the Russian Federation.  Pricing is as follows: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/fb13ab89/7d74e3a5/074443e2/5e31a458.png"><br><br>  GunnarOptiks Support Official Response <br><blockquote>  Since we‚Äôre not a prescription, however, there are a few issues: <br>  1. You won't be able to make sure they fit. <br>  2. There is no need to fix it. <br>  3. Shipping will be expensive <br><br>  This is why it isn‚Äôt any way to fix anything.  However, if you are a prescriber.  If you want to go ahead and go ahead, go ahead and leave. <br><br>  Just to clarify international shipping is actually $ 59.95.  Please note that you have signed the app. <br></blockquote><h6>  In short: We can make you a prescription lens, but since you are outside the US there are a few problems: <br>  1. You do not have the opportunity to try on the frames before manufacturing. <br>  2. There is no guarantee for repair / exchange / correction of lenses after manufacture. <br>  3. Expensive Delivery <br><br>  These factors are risky in the manufacture, because there is no possibility to fix anything after manufacturing.  But if you are confident in the desire, and agree with the risks, you are happy to make glasses on the RX-program. </h6><br><br>  You are sent a form that you need to fill out and sign it.  Then attach it to the order and actually pay for the order itself.  Shipping cost 60 USD <br><br>  Useful links: <br>  <a href="http://www.gunnars.com/technology/fractyl-microclimate.php">Video technology</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results%3Fsearch_query%3Dgunnars%2Breview%26aq%3D0%26oq%3Dgunnars%2Bre">Video reviews</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.gunnars.com/">Official site</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/121230/">https://habr.com/ru/post/121230/</a></p>
