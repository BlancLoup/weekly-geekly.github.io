  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Computer on Elm Street</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><h5>  Is there life outside the computer? </h5><br>  I just want to warn you, I wrote this text in front of the luminous window of the monitor, so the intellectual virus will do everything possible to make this text appear stupid to you or push it away.  But just think about it ... <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h5>  Man and computer, is there life in real life? </h5><br>  A major problem is brewing in the world.  An increasing number of people are being drawn into electronic networks.  More and more people spend most of their lives in front of a luminous monitor.  This is a prisoner.  If your profession is computer related, for example, you are a programmer or designer, then you are reborn.  Without realizing it, you grow together with the machine.  After a couple of decades, you will begin to understand that this is a man-made leech on your living body.  And I would like to get rid of it, but it does not work.  This is what I want to talk about. <br><br><h5>  Communication </h5><br>  One way or another, people in our time seem closer.  You always have a ‚Äúhandy‚Äù messenger where you can write a couple of lines to a loved one who may be hundreds of kilometers away from you.  You can meet and communicate with any person on Earth, regardless of status or nationality.  At the same time, be alone, without family, without children in your lonely apartment or indoors with silent zombies who stare all day like you on the screen.  This has already been said, this is not news. <br>  Why did I say "I want to get rid of"?  Indeed, with a well-organized interaction with the instrument of labor (and the computer was originally always a tool, like an ax or a bat in a primitive person) everything should be fine.  It must be, and what we have in reality?  Everyone knows which computer people are autists.  In the "live" with them can be very difficult to communicate.  A programmer perceives a living person as imperfection; he does not understand how it works and why it reacts to commands from his side differently than a car or a program.  And it‚Äôs hard on people.  And they prefer cars.  I must say that autism is not only computer scientists, but also any people who spend most of their lives with dead matter: machines, machines, etc.

    <h5>  What's next </h5><br>  Let's see what's going on.  The number of computers and the share of virtual life will only increase.  In the near future, what an ordinary autistic person looks like now will be.  It‚Äôs no secret that being a living person, for example, a programmer has the same need for emotion as any other.  However, he does not receive them.  A lack of emotions and feelings leads a person to mental disorders.  To put it briefly, he is "riding the roof." <br>  We, those who were the first to take the blow of technocracy, who were the first to encounter the unexplored effects of a computer and virtual life on a person, can judge the real state of affairs.  And things are bad. <br>  Imagine that after a decade, there were few people on the streets, cars as well.  All sit in their cells and are connected by electronic filaments.  Does the amount of contentment increase from this?  Not.  Will the amount of joy and happiness in a person increase?  Not.  As long as we are a living organism, inscribed in nature and generated by nature, we cannot be happy without movement, real communication, trees, grass, rain, smells and sounds. <br>  Of course, we are an information glutton.  If we could draw an analogy with ordinary food, and intellectual food, we would see that a computer programmer is such an informational fat man who suffers from an invisible overweight.  Try to take his hamburger from him! <br><br><h5>  How to be? </h5><br>  I propose for the beginning to understand that the path to the computerization of society is a dead-end path for the living.  Maybe, I‚Äôll open a secret for someone, there is a war of intellect (it is also called Satan) with living matter.  And the computer, robots and other mechanisms, seemingly more sophisticated tools, and there is the same cancer that will devour itself, and the whole body as a whole. <br>  After we understand that this is so, we can tell those who are following us and are still rejoicing at the new gadget or tablet, to which everything goes.  We can begin to reduce the share of "iron" in our lives.  Do not think that you can easily get rid of this infection.  She has already firmly entered our lives.  Modern society does not think of itself without the Internet; it has enveloped the octopus and penetrated into all spheres of our life. <br>  Now, when we gradually nullify or greatly limit the presence of dead intellectual matter in the life of everyone and society as a whole, we will come to the roots.  To nature. <br>  We will appreciate the emotions of people, the smell of hay or the moisture of rain on our face.  We will listen to the voice, its intonation, rejoice in the colors of the sky.  We may understand that only these things bring true happiness to man.  The feeling that he is alive. <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c82/db9/12c/c82db912c89e297f129955f68375fd26.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Finally, I recommend to review very thoughtfully such films as: ‚ÄúAvatar‚Äù, ‚ÄúTerminator2‚Äù, ‚ÄúLawnmower‚Äù, after which, click ‚ÄúShut Down‚Äù and think about how to continue living without a computer. <br><br>  Good luck! <br><br>  We broke the net, <br>  In space rocket <br>  Tearing the sky <br>  Iron head. <br>  In the wake of us waving children <br>  "Stuck" on the Internet. <br>  Shrouded in cobwebs, <br>  The earth globe is spinning. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/162073/">https://habr.com/ru/post/162073/</a></p>
