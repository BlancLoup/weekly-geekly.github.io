By the first round 2000 participants were selected, by the second - 400, and 50 people reached the final in Moscow.  The level this year was clearly higher than in the past: either the training and the fact that the tournament is gaining popularity, or that guests from other countries joined the game, had an effect.  Participants arrived finals of past years.

      16 Muscovites, 14 Petersburgers, two residents of Ekaterinburg, Nizhny Novgorod, Saratov got into the final, one participant came from Novosibirsk.  Also, three out of Belarus, Poland, Ukraine and even one person from Japan reached the final.  According to the rules of the tournament, we paid the road to everyone except the residents of Poland and Japan, and paid for the accommodation for each participant. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The average age of participants is about 24 years.  There were students and graduate students: the tasks were quite complex.  The level of players was very high: for all the time of Codeforces programming tournaments (of various levels), the first place in the world rating belongs to the winner of the championship Gennady Korotkevich (the nickname on CF is <a href="http://codeforces.ru/profile/tourist">tourist</a> , below him), and the second is just to our guest from Japan ( <a href="http://codeforces.ru/profile/rng_58">rng_58</a> ). <br><br>  Alas, the girls this time did not pass the final, although this happened a couple of times in past years. <br><br><h4>  Who has won? </h4><br>  Gennady Korotkevich (Gomel, Belarus, a student of ITMO St. Petersburg), he took home 100,000 rubles.  The second and third places are Egor Kulikov and Evgeny Kapun (Russia).  Full results are <a href="http://codeforces.ru/contest/308/standings">here</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/671/3ae/ae2/6713aeae2db915e3ee2933aa6452b9a7.jpg"><br>  <i>Winner</i> <br><br>  Makoto Soejima from Japan had a very busy schedule: departure from Sheremetyevo was at 8 pm, and he finished programming at 16:30.  He was accompanied by two gaydzinsky girls-promoters so that they would take him, help him, print boarding passes, etc., put him on the subway and see that he got to the aeroexpress train, which was sent literally an hour after the end of the tournament.  The fact is that with English he is not very good, but he comes to Russia for the 4th time for the sake of programming.  He found out the results already in Japan: he came in 5th place: his solution to task ‚ÄúA‚Äù failed in the final testing. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/151/ca7/bb8/151ca7bb85f815afa509a6be88ba02d9.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Finals </h4><br>  Tasks finals were only five.  <a href="http://codeforces.ru/contest/309">Here they are</a> .  Algorithm solutions can be <a href="http://codeforces.ru/blog/entry/7749">found here</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6b2/c9f/10e/6b2c9f10ef2a7e0b902b87e2b56a776a.jpg"><br><br><h4>  This year's surprise </h4><br>  We have a tradition: each final of the All-Russian Open Programming Championship begins with a mini-competition, a kind of surprise from KROK.  It is optional for participation, but it brings a lot of pleasure and experience, plus we give a small nice prize and a cup.  This year it was necessary to program the management strategy of hockey players. <br><br>  Each team had two field players and one goalkeeper.  The goalkeeper is controlled by the system, and the field players by a written strategy.  That is, each participant wrote a strategy for two players and played against another participant.  The task was to write such an algorithm so that the team would best protect its gates and attack the gates of the enemy.  There was an opportunity to send the puck into the goal and take away the puck, striking the player with a stick, for example. <br><br>  Individual test, one participant plays for one team and programs two hockey players.  The game was on the tournament scheme.  Each team played two matches, according to the results of which the first 16 passed to the second round.  After the one-eighth final, there was a quarter-final, a semi-final and a final series, with 4 participants left.  They played three matches, that is, each played with each.  Whoever scored more and missed less, he won. <br><br>  First, for 4 hours, everyone wrote the algorithm, and then in the main hall we arranged a tournament - they displayed the participants' games on the screen, and it was clear who played what, how who scored, etc.  For an hour everyone watched the matches without stopping: it was fun ‚Äî everyone shouted, they hurt and so on.  Gennady won too (who won the championship final). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d64/0f9/bc5/d640f9bc51a99808b7d2ab683d0f22e5.jpg"><br><br><h4>  How did it go? </h4><br>  On the first day, we arranged breakfast for them in the KROK cafeteria - the participants arrived early, at about 9 o'clock. The participants slowly had breakfast and tuned in to the game.  At 13 o'clock we gave a speech to the organizers, everyone went up to the computer class, and at about 13:45, the game round began at 4 o'clock.  After that - dinner in our dining room.  For those who wish, at the same time, they conducted an excursion in a protected outsourcing data center of KROK (where, alas, it is impossible to photograph due to the security requirements of customer companies).  Then he held the award on the results of the game round.  We also wanted to go bowling together on the first day.  However, there were only five people, of whom only one after the tour was ready to actually play - everyone was tired, it seemed. <br><br>  On the second day, they arrived later, after a good sleep, at about 11 am  After a snack, the competition began.  The final round was held according to standard Codeforces rules and took two and a half hours.  After it, participants had lunch and waited for results.  Ended all hours at 7 after the award.  Many then stayed in the dining room to play board games (they were sitting until 8 o'clock), a crocodile or something, I did not quite understand.  Someone went to see the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/croc/blog/165963/">office</a> , since we have a lot of interesting things. <br><br><h4>  How in general?  Will there be another such tournament? </h4><br>  In general, everything went very well.  Two words tournament described Dmitry Matov from Saratov: <br>  ‚ÄúI take part in the CROC Championship for the second time.  There are not so many such competitions in Russia - you can count on your fingers those companies that support sports programming in this way. ‚Äù <br><br>  Yes, next year there will be another big programming tournament.  Plus, we regularly hold various contests - for example, this year there was an Olympiad on system administration, now there is a competition of flying robots, there will be a couple of very interesting events, about which I will not tell you yet. <br><br>  If you do not want to miss - subscribe to the CROC corporate blog on Habr√©, we are going to continue to talk about the most interesting and publish announcements of major events. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/180617/">https://habr.com/ru/post/180617/</a></p>
