Let not everyone still got his own blogging tool, but almost everyone reads strangers.  In this regard, I began to receive letters in which readers are interested in what aggregator I use.  Actually, more than a year ago, the best newspaper on the planet published an article by the author of my beloved <a href="http://crazyhamster.livejournal.com/168564.html">Aggregator State</a> , moreover, a little later, Vitaly Krasilnikov presented to your attention two whole articles under the general title ‚ÄúHow to subscribe to RSS feeds‚Äù aggregators and not only were considered from all sides (## 36, 38, 2005).  Much time has passed since that time, but the situation with aggregators has changed little.  So you should just read these texts and choose what suits you best.  As for me personally, I have been using the RSSOwl program for about two years and am not going to change it. <br><br>  Let's return, finally, to the review!  This time, let's take a look at interesting blogs that are hosted by livejournal.com or just LiveJournal.  Much to my chagrin, these blogs are an order of magnitude larger than stand-alone.  Naturally, high-quality and interesting diaries are much more common.  And here are a few that I suggest you read. 
      <br>

      <br>
      First of all, we dive into the diaries of our compatriots (for whom how, but for me they are Belarusians).  Solemnly presenting LJ with the name " <a href="http://vinah.livejournal.com/">Dictionary of strange words</a> ."  A rather famous person in our Palestinians leads him, and I even know who it is, but I won‚Äôt tell you, because I‚Äôve been banned.  Once I, however, called these names and surnames, but I was waylaid in the alley in the evening and for this I was cruelly abused internal organs.  All off Hitchcock.  Since Live Journal is conducted by a journalist, all messages are already considered interesting by default.  And since the author also approaches them creatively, the pleasure of reading is guaranteed.  Until now, with warmth, I remember the story of a dead hamster, which I read in this LiveJournal. <br><br>  We are still in Belarus.  Therefore, it is vital for you to read a diary with the cute name " <a href="http://stopka.livejournal.com/">Che?</a> ".  Yes, also a journalist, I will not tell you what my name is either (the information in the blog is not written - it means we don‚Äôt need to know).  By the way, be sure to take a look at the ‚ÄúUser Information‚Äù section - there the author himself collected links to interesting, in his (her?) Opinion, messages in his journal.  There are a lot of links, in other words, so you will be more than enough for the next review. <br><br>  Probably, it is necessary to rush at a gallop along the significant Belarusian communities?  Through time and space I hear your friendly hum of approval.  First, the most heated discussions always take place in the <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/minsk_by">community of the glorious hero-city of Minsk</a> .  By the way, in the information about the community you can find links to other Belarusian communities.  Secondly, kind people <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/otdam_darom_by">donate</a> things they don‚Äôt need in the community of the same name, the main thing is to have time to take over all the bang for themselves.  Thirdly, for those who constantly search for work, the community <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/rabota_by">Jobs_BY is intended</a> , there, basically, of course, freelance.  Fourthly, the <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/music_by">music_by</a> music community, where posters of upcoming cultural events are constantly published.  Well and, fifthly, I will note the community for <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/by_foto">Belarusian photographers</a> , where there are very beautiful works. <br><br>  Alexandrov Maxim Sergeevich keeps a blog called " <a href="http://scandal-max.livejournal.com/">Joys and sorrows of the old fart</a> ."  The author is not at all old and certainly does not suffer from flatulence, but his LiveJournal is good.  Basically, the messages in this diary are an internet digest, links to various places on the web that interested the author.  In most cases, these links will interest you.  Occasionally, evil articles also appear, thanks to which Maxim Sergeevich has already made a notable handful of enemies.  It's already interesting, right? <br><br>  The next issue in our program is the blog of a wonderful photo artist <a href="http://users.livejournal.com/_ef_">Evgeny Kozhevnikov</a> .  Naturally, in this LiveJournal many original works of the author.  Some, first of all, appear precisely in LJ.  To interest people pimply period, I note that Eugene works with nudity.  Although, photos like not only teenagers, but all people with a sense of beauty. <br><br>  With such bears, armed with preds, we attack unsuspecting bloggers.  True, few of them are afraid of us, but we have time to learn.  Andrei Goncharov is the author of the blog " <a href="http://andrey-g.livejournal.com/">Should not be to</a> anyone."  Here is what we read in the information about the user: ‚ÄúA film producer, author of several Russian full-length cartoons that are in the production of various Russian companies.  From 1993 to 2003 - Head of large Russian distribution companies for CD and DVD sales.  Music producer.  Five-year experience in journalism: from correspondent to deputy.  editor.  Not very modest, but honestly.  In addition, Andrew is the creator and almost permanent author of the beautiful nostalgic community " <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/chtoby_pomnili">To Remember,</a> " this community is about actors who have already passed away. <br><br>  How do you like the blog of a priest?  For example, I like it because it‚Äôs not a fanatic who leads him, but a completely sane and interesting person.  The priest of the Holy Protection Church in Minsk (Vesnyanka) <a href="http://priestal.livejournal.com/">Alexander Shramko</a> .  And the name of the blog is good - "Do not believe, but believe."  No one will teach or guide you on the path of truth.  Just the thoughts of an intelligent person, and the life of the church from the inside, so to speak.  I confess that I don‚Äôt like churches, whatever they are (just don‚Äôt think of me as a militant atheist, I just believe in God), and at first I was skeptical about this blog, but I‚Äôve been reading it for more than a year now pleasure. <br><br>  So, after the blog of a priest, the blog of a deputy of the Russian State Duma is logical.  <a href="http://roizman.livejournal.com/">Yevgeny Roizman</a> is a deputy of the State Duma of the Russian Federation, a member of the State Duma Committee on Security, the former president of the Foundation "City Without Drugs", the owner of the only private museum in Russia, Nevyansk Icon.  The blog, in my opinion, is not politicized at all, which only appeals to me.  Most often, Eugene deals with topics related to the work of his foundation, and then, reading some of his reports, his hair stands on end from human cruelty.  Should I write that this blog from the category of those that need to bring in their aggregators? <br><br>  Literally in one line, especially since I mentioned this magazine in one of my previous reviews, <a href="http://samoleg.livejournal.com/">Oleg Kuvaev</a> is the creator of Masyan. <br><br>  I will take advantage of my official position and mention the blog of one of my good friends, a wonderful photographer <a href="http://tamriel.livejournal.com/">Andrei Dubinin</a> .  By the way, now an exhibition of his works is taking place in Minsk, which you can read about in this blog.  Well, to see there is a lot of wonderful things - photos for every taste.  Come and admire, well, and Andrei owed a bubbly drink "Buratino". <br><br>  Interesting communities will become a pleasant dessert today (this time not only Belarusian ones).  Firstly, the community for those born under the sign of the zodiac <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/telec">Taurus</a> , I pay special attention to this community, because now it is the time of <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/telec">Taurus</a> , and I myself have a direct relationship to this sign.  Find the community of other characters you do not make much effort, use this form - <a href="">livejournal.com/interests.bml</a> .  Secondly, the nostalgic community <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/76_82">76-82</a> seems to be for those who were born from 1976 to 1982, but no one forbids joining it and all others.  Thirdly, I can not pass by two communities dedicated to hamsters: the <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/homiachok">Hamster</a> <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/cult_of_hamster">Cult</a> and the <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/homiachok">Hamster</a> .  Have you already come to terms with the fact that hamsters are higher creatures and decide in all respects?  Fourth, <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/ulov">Catch</a> - links to LJ's favorite entries, that is, if you are not interested in what I am writing about, then maybe in this community you will find something to your taste? <br><br>  Professional <b>blogologist Lesha Kaletsky</b> <br><br>  <a href="http://kv.by/index2006170604.htm">Published in "Computer News" (# 17, 2006)</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/288050/">https://habr.com/ru/post/288050/</a></p>
