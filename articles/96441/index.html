Most recently, this topic was raised on Habr√©: <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/Itv/90048/">link</a> .

    <a name="habracut"></a>  I can only say that according to the terms of the contract under which I was provided with a prefix for digital television for free use, I only got acquainted after this contract was signed, the prefix was installed, and the installer was away from my door. <br><br>  This was my first and fatal mistake in this whole story.  In general, I was not satisfied with just one item under the terms of which I myself had to return the set-top box to the provider, otherwise the charge-off was not suspended.  And it was necessary to return the prefix by all means on a weekday and by all means during working hours.  The fact that many people find it difficult just to take time off from work, none of the Beeline employees naturally thought of. <br><br>  Since this is the case, I decided to use it and certainly find the advantages of this service, it may not be necessary to return the equipment.  But after a month of use, I realized that I didn‚Äôt need this service, I wouldn‚Äôt use it, and all the more so.  I disconnected from the ‚ÄúDigital TV‚Äù service without difficulty, but with the ‚ÄúEquipment rental‚Äù service everything turned out to be more difficult. <br><br>  I called Beeline, asking: <br>  - Could you take the equipment from me yourself. <br>  - Well - the girl answers, on that side - the courier will contact you and specify the date and time of arrival. <br>  - How soon? <br>  - Usually couriers arrive in a week. <br>  - Well, it suits me. <br><br>  And now guess, comrades, how many weeks have I been waiting for this wonderful courier?  Well, place your bets: <br>  - Two? <br>  - Four? <br>  ‚ÄúEight weeks?‚Äù <br><br>  Gentlemen of the jury and assessors did not guess - two and a half months passed.  During this time, I called technical support several times, in addition to my phone number I left my spouse's phone number.  He wrote several letters.  And every time they tell me the same thing: "The courier could not reach you, the phone was not available."  This is despite the fact that I don‚Äôt leave Moscow from anywhere, I never disconnect my phone, if my phone was not in the access zone or busy while someone was dialing me, I received SMS ‚ÄúYou got a call ...‚Äù.  But I did not receive any SMS. <br><br>  With the phone number of the spouse all the same.  And it is true that she sits at home, does not go to the subway, does not exist in the basements. <br><br>  - How?  Explain to me how it can be in non-access areas? <br><br>  As a result, I pay 2 months for renting a set-top box, which I do not use.  And I do not know when it will end? <br><br>  UPDATE: I would like to clarify that I have no complaints against Beeline to impose services.  In the modern world, this has become the norm.  The claim is that they do not reckon with me as a client, deceiving me and not fulfilling my promises. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/96441/">https://habr.com/ru/post/96441/</a></p>
