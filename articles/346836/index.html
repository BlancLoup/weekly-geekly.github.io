Let's rock them, folks! <br><br><h2>  REGARDLESS vs.  IRREGARDLESS </h2><br>  The <i>term “all”</i> means: <i>“I don’t care,” “in principle, it doesn’t matter</i> . <i>”</i> 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"

      <br>
      Example: <br><br> <code>Regardless of what ur sayin' now, I'm not changin' my mind, man. <br>   ,    , ,   . <br></code> <br>  However, some English speakers will say: <i>“Irregardless of what ur sayin 'now”</i> , because <i>“irregardless”</i> sounds emotionally and expressively.  Everyone wants to seem smart &amp; intelligent, alas, it does not always work. <br><br>  By the way, this American dialectism appeared in the 20th century, probably from <i>“irrespective”</i> (irrelevant) and <i>“regardless”</i> .  However, the word has not yet earned the respect of most neytivov, therefore it is found only in colloquial speech. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  WELL vs.  GOOD </h2><br>  Example: <br><br> <code>— Hey, how did ya little sis do in her Chinese exam, dude? <br> ,        , ? <br> <br> — Lucy did good / well. Thanks 4 askin', bro. <br>   . ,  , . <br></code> <br>  In fact, all easy-peasy: <i>“good”</i> is an adjective that is used to describe nouns;  <i>"Well"</i> - adverb, is used after the verbs.  When you understand the difference in use, the expression <i>“Lucy did good”</i> sounds grammatically incorrect.  After all, <i>“did”</i> is an auxiliary verb, which demands after itself a faithful friend in the person of the adverb “well”. <br><br>  However, every day we have to answer <i>“Oh, I'm good.</i>  <i>Thx. ”</i> To the question <i>“ Heyo, mate, how r ya doin '? ”.</i>  Although, according to the grammatical tenets, it is impossible to say this, but this expression is so often used in lively English-speaking speech that it sounds completely appropriate for most neutivs. <br><br><h2>  ANYWAY vs.  ANYWAYS </h2><br>  Using the expression <i>“anyway</i> ” is a way to change the subject of conversation or to complete it altogether. <br><br>  For example: <br><br>  <i>“I went to the library on Friday.</i>  <i>Anyway, it's better to finish off this task</i> . <i>”</i>  In short, we changed the topic of conversation from the library to work. <br><br>  Alternatively, anyway will be used at the end of the sentence: <br><br>  <i>“Well, babe, the movie is a waste of time anyway.</i>  <i>“Well, baby, the movie is a waste of time anyway,”</i> and by that we put an end. <br><br>  However, the slang word <i>“anyways”</i> is quite popular now <i>,</i> especially among English-speaking youth.  In itself, the expression means "time is up, of course, you can continue, but this is no longer interesting to me." <br><br>  The question is: right or wrong to use <i>"anyways"</i> .  In fact, there is no definitive answer.  On the one hand, there is a grammatically correct alternative in the form of <i>“anyway”</i> .  But, on the other hand, conversational speech allows you to move away from all the usual rules. <br><br><h2>  AUXILIARY VERBS OF THE DOWN </h2><br>  In English-language films, characters often ask questions without having to use the full form for construction, namely, auxiliary verbs at the beginning of a sentence.  So instead of <i>“Do u have a laptop?”</i> Appears <i>“U have a laptop?”</i> . <br><br>  The same manner of communication applies to correspondence in the network.  It can be assumed that this is due to the fact that neyty to the edge of lazy to prescribe all parts of the proposal.  In fact, this is a living example of the impact of lifestyle changes due to urbanization on the English language. <br><br>  Time is a valuable resource in the life of modern people, so all sorts of cuts are a great way not to waste it.  However, it is important to understand that, even colloquially, the expression <i>“What doin '?</i>  “Instead of <i>“ What u doin '? ”</i> Or <i>“ What ur doin'? ”</i> Sounds extremely impolite.  So, always be careful when using abbreviated questions. <br><br><h2>  EVERY DAY vs.  EVERYDAY </h2><br>  And, finally, one of the most common mistakes that native speakers make.  Even in elementary schools, teachers often teach children that the word <i>“everyday”</i> means what happens every day.  In reality it is not.  By <i>“everyday” is</i> meant “habitual”, “everyday”, “routine” and “ordinary”, as this is an adjective. <br><br>  Example: <br><br> <code>Mina is so fed up with her everyday life that she went hitchhiking all over the globe. <br>        ,       . <br> <br> I drink a big mug of americano and eat a donut every day to cheer up. <br>          ,  . <br></code> <br>  <i>It is important to remember that English is a living thing that constantly changes depending on the people who use it, so do not be afraid to break the rules.</i>  <i>But only sometimes;)</i> <br><br><h2>  Reader Bonuses </h2><br> <a href="https://www.englishdom.com/prices/xabra3/%3Futm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_source%3Dhabra%26utm_campaign%3Dmistakes1701"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/e9/tf/yz/e9tfyzko4el0o2eyab8drkgqeim.png"></a> <br><br>  Catch free access to three months of learning English with our online courses.
