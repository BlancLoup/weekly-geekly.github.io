  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Umbrella monitoring of IT resources</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Any modern business depends on IT.  However, nowadays IT is supported not only by individual IT resources or IT processes, they at least ensure the provision of IT services as the maximum quality IT support for business processes.  It is this service model that requires an integrated approach to IT management.  Therefore, customers are increasingly turning to the use of scattered to a centralized umbrella monitoring, covering all information systems and all equipment in a single "control panel". <br><br> <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/hpe/blog/278883/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/19c/01f/d6a/19c01fd6a15c48e580ab21429f700cc1.jpg"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Umbrella monitoring allows businesses to identify the real effectiveness of IT and their direct impact on the performance of the company as a whole.  This is achieved by collecting information from all sources of IT infrastructure and information systems, building service-resource models, linking key performance indicators to these models and visualizing these models in near real-time mode.  In companies and organizations that use disparate monitoring tools, there is no single understanding of the IT infrastructure and, as a result, the impact of an event on the quality of the provision of IT services.  Umbrella monitoring allows you to tie everything together and organize management from a single console. <br><br>  With regard to business benefits, the introduction of an umbrella monitoring system allows, first of all, to reduce the time to identify possible problems that may lead to equipment malfunctions and information systems.  System administrators do not need to navigate between several open windows of various monitoring systems, trying to reduce several graphs and visually assess certain patterns and relationships.  The solution for umbrella monitoring itself provides such analytical information, as well as signals the root causes of incidents in the operation of equipment and software.

      In addition, the consolidated provision of information will avoid redirecting requests from the administrator to the administrator, from department to department, which often happens.  Thus, a business can reorient its IT professionals from routine work to solving more important tasks, because from 70 to 90% of the IT staff working time is spent on supporting the existing infrastructure, so there is not so much left to introduce new technologies. <br><br>  The HPE Operations Bridge, from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, which is an evolutionary milestone in the development of the ‚Äúclassic‚Äù HPE Operation Manager monitoring system that has been on the market for many years and has versions for various operating systems, can be called one of the most advanced integrated solutions for umbrella monitoring of the company's IT assets. systems.  Despite the many years of popularity and a huge number of customers, the HPE Operation Manager uses already obsolete technologies, such as, for example, Java-console.  In turn, HPE Operations Manager I, the HPE Operations Bridge event console, are based on HTML5 technologies, new agent management techniques, new approaches to data visualization, etc.  One of the most striking innovations is the support of Big Data.  Thus, the methods of the HPE Operation Manager not only improved technologically, but also enriched integration capabilities for interaction with external systems.  It is important to note that users of the HPE Operation Manager can safely switch to the HPE Operations Bridge with the help of developer technical support, by installing new components and gradually transferring functionality to new products. <br><br>  In addition to the HPE Operations Manager I event console, the HPE Operations Bridge includes basic components such as Monitoring Automation, a multi-tier monitoring subsystem, the Service Health Reporter, an information collection and reporting system, a TBEC event correlation mechanism, and HPE data collection agents. Operations Agent and HPE SiteScope Agentless Monitoring System.  If earlier HPE had a number of disparate products for gathering information and monitoring IT assets, today they are presented as an integrated integrated solution. <br><br>  Features HPE Operations Bridge can not only monitor the status of the equipment, but also to analyze the performance and performance of the applications used, both system and application from the point of view of the real user.  Monitoring is built on the basis of a multi-level model, and at the highest level a service-resource model is formed, reflecting the state of the service that IT provides to its users. <br><br>  At the heart of the HPE Operations Bridge is a modular architecture and collectors - data collectors that collect information from various systems.  For example, the Cloud Optimizer collector is used to obtain information on the operation of the virtual infrastructure.  Storage data collection manager is responsible for collecting data on the operation of the storage system.  The Network Node Manager I collector is engaged in obtaining information about the operation of the network. In fact, based on the data flow received from collector collectors, a service-resource model is formed.  All collectors are optional.  If necessary, the customer can connect any external monitoring system to the HPE Operations Bridge, including from a third-party manufacturer, and developers offer a number of adapters for this purpose.  In this case, the information obtained from this system will also be involved in the construction of the service-resource model.  Supported third-party systems include IBM, CA, BMC Software, as well as the open source applications of Nagios and Zabbix.  BSM connectors can be used to integrate unsupported systems.  Customers who have signed up for HP Operations Bridge technical support receive these integration services for free. <br><br>  The HPE Operations Bridge is installed on the customer's IT infrastructure, but if necessary, customers can use the cloud-based IT asset monitoring services that are provided by numerous Hewlett Packard Enterprise Russian partners or the company's IT-monitoring SaaS services. <br><br>  HPE Operations Bridge is available in three editions.  Junior Express provides for the installation of the HP Operations Manager I console and a number of data collectors, the Premium edition, also provides for the possibility of accumulating metrics and statistics in a database based on Big Data and building on analytical reports using the Operation Bridge Reporter component, as well as the possibility of correlating services -resource model.  Ultimate Edition includes, in addition to the above, the HPE Operations Orchestrator IT infrastructure management system and the Business Value Dashboard visualization system for business. <br><br>  Initially, among potential customers of the HPE Operations Bridge, Hewlett Packard Enterprise saw representatives of medium and large businesses.  But with the advent of the affordable Express edition, this solution may also interest small businesses interested in supporting and monitoring their IT infrastructure.  The minimum licensing limit is 50 servers, so this offer may be especially relevant for technology companies that have a large server park and a limited staff - Internet and telecom services providers, commercial data centers, etc.  The first implementations of the HPE Operations Bridge in Russia have already taken place.  Customers were representatives of the banking sector. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/278883/">https://habr.com/ru/post/278883/</a></p>
