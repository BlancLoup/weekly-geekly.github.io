  <section class="page js-page"><h1>DIY music in the bathroom</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Good day. <br><br>  In the spring, hands finally reached the repair in the bathroom.  When collecting the requirements for the future functionality, the idea was born, and not whether to add the ability to listen to music in the bath?  For example, play media content from a home NAS.  I liked the idea of ‚Äã‚Äã‚Äúmusic in the bathroom‚Äù, and I went to Google to see what solutions exist. <br><br>  At the end of the event I decided to share information and the results of my work. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  At home, like most of you, there is a local area network with Wi-Fi. <br>  Home NAS (Synology) stores the entire collection of photos, music and movies. <br>  TV, Home Theater Receiver, PS3 - all have a LAN-out and content from a NAS, and can be played on any monitor from any device, from TV to phones.

      Google issued several workflows, and a couple of forums where issues were resolved on their own. <br><br><h3>  0) Best advice - first advice </h3><br>  To the question ‚Äúhow to organize music in the bathroom?‚Äù Google said: <br>  <i>Leave your door open.</i> <br>  Can not argue. <br><br><h3>  1) Bring a radio or tape recorder </h3><br>  I do not know which tape recorders are being released, but for sure, portable devices, online radio and even docking stations for phones can solve the problem of listening to music anywhere with a certain level of sound quality and safety for devices. <br><br><h3>  2) Active Bluetooth speakers </h3><br>  Lots of different options for implementing this scheme.  And built into the ceiling, and freestanding, and even floating in the bath with you.  There are many of them, and by <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Hipe-Waterproof-Bluetooth-Handsfree-speakerphone/dp/B005Z3GINK">the</a> way, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Hipe-Waterproof-Bluetooth-Handsfree-speakerphone/dp/B005Z3GINK">this option</a> may please someone.  And this <a href="http://www.amazon.com/IDuck-Waterproof-Radio-Wireless-Speaker/dp/B001U3B1K4/ref%3Dsr_1_1%3Fs%3Delectronics%26ie%3DUTF8%26qid%3D1348314122%26sr%3D1-1%26keywords%3Dwaterproof%2Bspeakers%2Bduck">Utia is</a> simply superb.  The sound quality is not talking. <br>  Separately highlight the product Ishower ( <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results%3Fsearch_query%3Dishower%26oq%3Dishower%26gs_l%3Dyoutube.3..35i39l2.1482.8479.0.8578.21.14.7.0.0.0.88.741.14.14.0...0.0...1ac.1.aQneMD0R0N8">issuance of YouTube</a> ).  Take a look. <br><br><h3>  3) Use power DC </h3><br>  Uses an existing receiver from a home theater with zone switching.  Two sets of acoustics are connected to one amplifier, one located in the hall, the other (for example) in the bathroom.  Frankly, I was tempted to implement such a scheme on my Denon 1912. It has the ability to zone broadcast, and an informal, but nicely working application for android, allowing you to manage it from your phone.  But I prefer the principle of system independence, so I did not dare to impose additional functions on the receiver. <br><br><h3>  4) Zoning </h3><br>  Solutions are not collective and relatively expensive.  The first step to "smart home". <br><br>  <b>Sonos</b> ( <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DZV31ZX68Ygk">manufacturer's video review</a> ) <br>  Allows you to install a single content translator and local wireless players in each room (in each zone).  Further, the music is broadcast independently on each zone of its own (or for all common).  Everything is controlled from a phone, tablet or special console.  Expensive, but worthy.  I must say, a couple of days licked at this option, but the hypnotoad won. <br><br>  <b>Iport</b> ( <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DgrN5S5pIUwM">component</a> <b>minidizer</b> ) <br>  For fans of a little more confusion - I recommend to look at the components of Iport. <br>  The prices for the components in total exceed the comfort ones, and the scheme is a bit complicated for me, but it does its job.  The phone becomes not just a remote control, but also a source of content. <br><br>  None of the ready-made schemes I liked.  Either pathetic or expensive.  And if with the second I can measure in part, then the first did not want to have.  Therefore, having assessed my strength, I decided to assemble the installation myself. <br>  The scheme is as follows: <br>  - Tablet on the wall as a control monitor <br>  - Built-in ceiling speakers <br>  - Stereo amplifier for sound quality <br><br><h3>  The tablet </h3><br>  Without thinking up the bike, I took the Chinese tablet Ainol (I bought a new one on the forum ad on w3bsit3-dns.com). <br>  Attracted: <br>  - the lack of buttons on the front. <br>  - screen size (7 "), <br>  - front camera (2mp) <br>  - Android 4.0. <br>  - Price <br>  <b>Cost - 5000 rubles</b> <br><br>  Fitting. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/50d/df8/2af/50ddf82afc0edd87869c8819bb237253.jpg"><br><br><h3>  Speakers </h3><br>  The choice is small, I bought a built-in waterproof speakers.  I took a couple of Visaton FRS 10 WP / 8 in a famous store.  Did not forget 15 meters of normal audio cable and 4 terminals for attaching the cable to the speaker contacts <br>  <b>All together in the area - 5000 rubles</b> <br><br><h3>  Amplifier </h3><br>  The speakers are passive, so you need a stereo amplifier.  On request "miniature stereo amplifier" - found FiiO A1.  Cool toy with good potential and reviews.  In this unit (IR) and, in addition to RCA-inputs, there is a linear.  It was possible to use it, but I did not. <br>  <b>Price - 5500 rubles.</b> <br><br>  Scheme assembled and tested. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/212/eaf/057/212eaf05771e942acecbd4ec8764b4cd.jpg"><br><br>  In the ceiling, where the hidden light will be laid, put the hatch, invisible from below, to have access to the equipment in the future.  Behind this door there will be an amplifier, and immediately one of the speakers is built under it.  In the wall vertically down will go a thick 32nd corrugation.  It will be laid audio line and power for the tablet. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5db/34d/847/5db34d84751147316f88b43b193e27ad.jpg"><br><br>  The corrugation could have been thinner, but I thought that an extra duct to the integrated technology would not hurt.  I did not regret a single second, because then twice I had to replace the cables in the already bricked corrugation. <br>  Made a seat for the tablet and the future frame for the desired size.  Both the tablet itself and the frame are held on magnets (I have to keep a good hold on it), so you don‚Äôt have to peel or break anything to disassemble the whole structure.  Magnets bought in a hardware store in the department of fasteners.  White wires to the left of the tablet - an electrician. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/dc8/3ac/2c6/dc83ac2c63d2d423be3da784b1fa7639.jpg"><br><br>  The tablet was placed flush with the tile, and then I took the appropriately sized penny photo frame and finished it (extended from the reverse side to the right places) so that the frame on the magnets pressed onto the tile on the wall as close as possible, closing all the seams and covering all the connectors.  It was worthy only with the third attempt. <br><br>  Everything is ready for the first run. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cdBzM0BFBkw" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  We achieve the rest of the space around with tiles, and it is possible to assemble the entire structure. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/03e/6be/886/03e6be886c04073fa275c2f866581fe7.jpg"><br><br>  From the first time, it also failed beautifully: the power cord of the tablet had a straight plug and did not want to fit into the framework (well, you understood me).  Therefore, it had to be taken out and found an L-shaped adapter (the 32nd wide corrugation was useful here). <br>  After the final check, the installation can be disassembled and hidden until all the dirty repairs in the bathroom are completed. <br><br>  Well, that's what happened in the end. <br><br>  Sound <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/405/ca4/b92/405ca4b92dabd3236a1e55fe8549f245.jpg"><br><br>  Monitor <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/149/623/958/149623958d6ac4255147cca595626599.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Pros and cons of the month of practice: <br></h4><br><br><h5>  pros </h5><br>  - Playing any content (streaming audio, video from NAS). <br>  - Good and loud sound, bathroom acoustics contributes. <br>  - In addition to music, all other features of any tablet are available (google market, twitter, weather, clock, YouTube, traffic jams, voice search) <br>  - Thanks to the IP surveillance camera (it is connected to the NAS), I can see a picture from the street without leaving the bath.  Open the truth, I can not. <br>  - Multitasking.  Music plays in the background while I watch traffic jams or watch is on. <br>  - Stylish, although made with his own hands. <br>  - Easy replacement, repair.  You can easily pull out, wipe, replace. <br>  - Not heated (checked specifically) <br><br><h5>  Minuses: </h5><br>  - No remote control (remout) <br>  - If the tablet breaks - I will have to change a hole in the wall, if I don‚Äôt find the same one. <br>  - There are no power buttons on the face, if you need to ‚Äúput it to sleep‚Äù - you have to remove the frame.  It is not difficult, but magnets are not very fond of often. <br><br>  Thank you for your attention, I have only one question left for a respected audience.  Are there programs (app) for remote control of one android using another?  Maybe this will solve the issue with a remote control? <br><br>  <b>Upd (09/14)</b> <br>  Greetings. <br>  Exactly 2 years later, I will be noted for those who asked about the reliability of such a system. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/25d/b0c/8ce/25db0c8ce00546c3bcfece8d443a9c7c.jpg"><br><br>  Everything is good.  Everything is working. <br>  The most commonly used applications: <br>  - MediaHouse (Pro) for streaming music from your home NAS-a. <br>  - PlanetLounge and Something Classic - for relaxing music from Internet radio stations <br>  - Youtube - by appointment <br><br>  + Maps, Mail, Clock and Metronome (for musical rehearsals). <br><br>  I continue to be pleased as an elephant, for brushing my teeth under Ska-p or Trivium is better than in silence. <br><br>  <b>Upd (09/15)</b> <br>  Salute, the Internet. <br>  3 years, normal flight.  But compared to my latest phones and tablets, well, it works very slowly. <br>  Google.Music did not start, Yandex.Music - has no horizontal orientation. <br><br><img width="800" src="https://habrastorage.org/files/858/cc1/c7d/858cc1c7d79b4f1293d7d07d4eb8c260.JPG"><br><br>  <b>Upd (09/16)</b> <br>  Good evening.  I will continue the tradition. <br>  4 years without a single break.  I am already inclined to think that the tablet will most likely become obsolete and stop supporting modern programs, rather than die of dampness. <br>  Google Music, by the way, did not work. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f20/49a/79a/f2049a79afcb46d08de70424132814c1.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Upd (09/17)</b> <br>  And again an update from my boudoir.  The system works like a clock.  Slowly but surely. <br>  Five years have passed, but I have never climbed into the flap at the top to check the amplifier. <br>  He, probably, had already gained reason in the dust and darkness of so many years. <br>  Everything works except Google Music. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/ce/29/59ce29750b64a194377815.jpeg"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/151988/">https://habr.com/ru/post/151988/</a></p>
