  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Internet for people with impaired color perception and not only. The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãsolving the problem at the global level</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> Hello, dear habouksoobschestvo!  A couple of days ago, at night, I was visited by one very interesting thought, namely, how to make the Internet more accessible for the visually impaired and people suffering from color impairment (color blind).  How we can help them (developers, designers, <abbr title="User interface">UI</abbr> / <abbr title="User eXperience">UX</abbr> specialists) and browser creators can be found under the cut.  So, perhaps, Habrahabr looks for some of us. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/52c/8db/b78/52c8dbb7881dfb2d20370cc29f211396.png" alt="Type mark"><br><br>  And how do you see Habrakhabr, <code>{userName}</code> ? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  About the state of affairs </h4><br>  Today, when search engines and websites know almost everything about you, in order to give you targeted issuance, advertising and anything else, except what you are actually looking for (maybe I exaggerate, but many adhere to this point of view).  At this time, visually impaired people still need to manually look for a link to the transition to an adapted version of the site.  At this very time, designers and <abbr title="User interface">UI</abbr> / <abbr title="User eXperience">UX</abbr> specialists are trying to choose colors so that they are equally well perceived by ordinary users and color blind.  Thousands of copies broken on this field.  This is not an easy task, considering how many types of color perception disorders exist:

    <ul><li>  Protanopia (Red-Blind) </li><li>  Deuteranopia (Green-Blind) </li><li>  Tritanopia (Blue-Blind) </li><li>  Protanomaly (Red-Weak) </li><li>  Deuteranomaly (Green-Weak) </li><li>  Tritanomaly (Blue-Weak) </li><li>  Achromatopsia (Rod Monochromacy) </li><li>  Blue Cone Monochromacy </li></ul><br>  You can read more on wikipedia: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_blindness">Color Blindness</a> .  Most color-blind people have problems with the perception of red or green color, but for this reason the others are somehow wrong to ignore.  But if you try to please everyone (this approach never works), then nothing will come of you, adapting the colors for one variant of the violation, we will spoil the perception for the other.  Such are the cases.  And this is what rainbow colors <sup>*</sup> look like for people with some color perception disorders: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/065/a93/a5b/065a93a5b3cb02bbddde11336ae0ddf0.png" alt="Colors of rainbow"><br><br>  Well, now you know what the <abbr title="Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender">LGBT</abbr> flag for color blind people looks like.  Although it is also the flag of the world, the <strike>Jewish Autonomous Republic of the Russian Federation</strike> (as I was corrected, there are still 7 colors) and, as it turned out, there is a lot more.  But now for some reason he is associated with only one person ... <br>  <b>UPD:</b> I was surprised when I saw this flag as an example on Wikipedia, but trolling is actually valid.  By the way, they don‚Äôt have the same rainbow color on the flag, guess what =) <br><br><h4>  About the scale of the problem </h4><br>  Or maybe figs with him, because they didn‚Äôt pay attention to this before, which means now it is possible?  Well, firstly, earlier these problems were also paid attention to, but, unfortunately, not as often as they should.  From the recent we can recall how the Moscow metro scheme was adapted, you can read about it in Ludwig on <a href="http://grosslarnakh.livejournal.com/39527.html">LiveJournal</a> .  But I repeat that the scales are not the same, well, I don‚Äôt really make a version of the site with an alternative color scheme, in fact ... although we will come back to this.  Now let's see how many people around us have color perception disorders. <br><table><tbody><tr><th>  Gender </th><th>  Protanomaly </th><th>  Deuteranomaly </th><th>  Protanopia </th><th>  Deuteranopia </th></tr><tr><th>  Male </th><td>  1.08% </td><td>  4.63% </td><td>  1.01% </td><td>  1.27% </td></tr><tr><th>  Female </th><td>  0.03% </td><td>  0.36% </td><td>  0.02% </td><td>  0.01% </td></tr></tbody></table><br>  The label is taken from the book <b>‚ÄúColor Vision: From Genes to Perception‚Äù</b> (Karl R. Gegenfurtner, Lindsay T. Sharpe). <br>  Total, we have about <b>8% of the male</b> population and <b>0.5% of the female</b> .  For comparison, the population of Russia is about 2% (140 million / 7 billion).  Draw your own conclusions. <br><br><h4>  How to make the Internet better </h4><br>  So, what came to my mind at 2 am?  The idea was to add additional settings to all browsers (a couple of extra checkboxes) in which a person, if desired, could choose the desired item (visually impaired, such and such kind of color blindness).  And then this mode / property / attribute could be used by developers on sites.  You could use it through <code>JavaScript</code> , but even better, in my opinion, add a new <code>media type</code> for <code>media queries</code> so that you can adapt the content through <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> .  By the way, there are already types of <code>aural</code> (Used for speech and sound synthesizers) and <code>braille</code> (Used for braille tactile feedback devices), so why not add a couple more?  Here I want to focus on the fact that this approach will help <b>different</b> categories of users, and not just blind and visually impaired.  This is me to the fact that now and then there are unusual I / O devices and this can also be taken into account, but this is the topic of a separate article. <br><br>  Now, about why I am writing all this in Habr√©.  There are people who can influence the development of browsers!  At a minimum, this is <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/pepelsbey/" class="user_link">pepelsbey</a> (Opera) and <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/forgotten/" class="user_link">forgotten</a> (Yandex), there are representatives of other companies.  And <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/forgotten/" class="user_link">forgotten</a> is also a member of the <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> <abbr title="Technical Architecture Group">TAG</abbr> .  There are also a lot of people here who directly decide whether to adapt the site or not.  And I don‚Äôt say how many people are involved in web-design in one way or another.  Well and the main thing, if it is possible to adapt simply by writing an additional <code>media query</code> , the number of adapted materials in the network should increase significantly.  After all, if it is possible to improve something with small forces, why not do it?  And this is the main point. <br><br><h4>  Dry residue </h4><br>  The essence of my idea lies in targeted content delivery, as far as we implement the option proposed by me, I propose to discuss in the comments, I would also like to see criticism, other solutions, and so on.  From the experts I would like to hear the viability of this idea and options for technical implementation.  In general, let's make the Internet a little better <b>together</b> ! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/195532/">https://habr.com/ru/post/195532/</a></p>
