In the center of the criminal case is a contract between the FSUE ‚ÄúNPO named after Lavochkin‚Äù and LLC ‚ÄúScientific and Production Enterprise‚Äú Dauria ‚Äù.  In the criminal case, only two names were mentioned - the general director of the Lavochkin Scientific-Production Association, Viktor Hartov, and the general director, Dauriya Aerospace, Sergei Ivanov. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/50f/db9/f1a/50fdb9f1a9d568124123001658a0b2cc.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The beneficiary of the Dauria Aerospace group of Russian companies is the Cyprus offshore, which is known to have Mikhail Kokorich and Dauria top managers, Sergey Ivanov and Dmitry Khan, as well as I2BF Global Ventures fund co-owners of the company‚Äôs founding co-owners. .

      In 2013, the NGO them.  Lavochkina signed a contract for 1.016 billion rubles with Dauria Aerospace, which provided for the implementation of the development work of the Space Platform "Karat-200" (ROC "Karat-200"). <br><br>  In July 2014, Dauria Aerospace submitted to the Lavochkin Scientific and Production Association the acts on the work and managed to get 10 million rubles for the projects, which is a particularly large scale within the scope of the Criminal Code. <br><br>  The essence of the criminal case is as follows: <br>  The expert group drawn from the enterprises and scientific organizations of Roskosmos, drawn to assess the work done, wrote a conclusion in which they indicated a number of signs of fictitiousness in the documentation for the transaction.  In particular, the technical characteristics of devices in different parts of the same document differ significantly, and the interdependent characteristics contradict each other.  Some of the materials were copied without editing from various sources and there was a formal formation of the text with minor editing, and not design.  The conclusion also says that by the time of attracting Dauria Aerospace to the design, the development of the unified space platform "Karat-200" was almost completed by the Lavochkin Scientific-Production Association at the expense of the Federal Space Program. <br><br>  Sergei Ivanov <a href="http://izvestia.ru/news/583760">told Izvestia</a> that he is not yet aware of the initiation of a criminal case. <br><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúYes, we participate in research and development projects and development projects commissioned by third parties, we conduct our own developments,‚Äù says Ivanov.  - I can assure you that we work strictly within the law. </blockquote><br><br>  Mikhail Kokorich, president of the private Russian satellite company Dauria Aerospace, said on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/mkokorich/posts/10205959236840990">his Facebook page</a> that he did not have information about a criminal case: <br><blockquote>  We have read this news ... having learned for the first time about the initiation of a criminal case.  Therefore, especially details yet. </blockquote><br><br>  <u>[UPDATE]</u> <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B--LHRmY12t2WU1IaW1GdnRhYkU/view">Cosmic Digest</a> journal found today <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B--LHRmY12t2WU1IaW1GdnRhYkU/view">.</a>  <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B--LHRmY12t2WU1IaW1GdnRhYkU/view">April 2015 No14 (117)</a> with the article devoted to ‚ÄúDauria Aerospace‚Äù - ‚ÄúDauria is the end.  Mikhail Kokorich fled to California. ‚Äù <br><blockquote>  On April 17, the article ‚ÄúMikhail Kokorin:‚Äú After the Crimea and Boeing, investors said bluntly: guys, forget about the money ‚Äùwas published in the Slon.ru publication.  Unfortunately, the publication publishes only a third of the article in the public domain.  The whole text can only be read by subscribers.  Therefore, knowing that for the sake of one publication, our readers are unlikely to subscribe to "Elephant", right in the body of this article we will link some of Kokorin's answers to the comments of the journalist Mard Totsky (highlighted in blue) so as not to violate the copyright of the Slon.ru publication </blockquote><br><br>  <u>Publications in the media:</u> <br>  <i>March 7, 2015</i> <br>  <a href="http://izvestia.ru/news/583797">We were unable to clearly state our arguments to the Investigative Committee.</a> <br><blockquote>  As part of the release of the draft, alternative options should be considered, this is a standard requirement.  Presented solutions should be compared, and then a specific option is selected.  So the order for the design of the same platform is not a violation.  Two works were carried out in parallel then, so that the scientific and technical council of Roskosmos received an alternative point of view - what the same solution looks like, executed in the conventionally ‚Äúwestern‚Äù version, that is, from imported components and on Western design ideology.  That was the meaning of attracting "Dauria", which has all the licenses, production facilities, qualified personnel, quality system <br></blockquote><br><br>  <i>April 8, 2015</i> <br>  <a href="http://izvestia.ru/news/585130">MIA found in the NGO them.</a>  <a href="http://izvestia.ru/news/585130">S.A.</a>  <a href="http://izvestia.ru/news/585130">Lavochkin criminal community</a> <br><blockquote>  Chief Designer FSUE "NPO them.
