  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Important points when linking to your site</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Optimizing the site so that the quality content placed on it is well represented in the search engines is a complex and time consuming task.  Unfortunately, sometimes site owners direct their efforts in the wrong direction, asking for help from unscrupulous agencies, losing wasted time and money. <br><br>  High-quality and unique content over time will attract visitors by itself.  Despite this, some search engine optimizers offer link building mechanisms, promising to increase their ranking in a short time and bring the site to the top positions in search results.  One of these mechanisms is the paid or free placement of links on sites that are specifically designed to participate in such schemes.  Since the quality of the content on these sites is usually very low, they do not represent any value to users. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Not quite clear what is at stake?</b>  <b>Consider an example:</b> <br><br>  <i>Bed - great furniture, because you can sleep in it.</i>  <i>Most of us sleep at night.</i>  <i>In the shops you can buy a <a href="http://www.example.com/">cheap blanket</a> .</i>  <i>The blanket will not allow to freeze at night.</i>  <i>You can also buy a heater.</i>  <i>It is better to buy a heater, because it gives more heat.</i>  <i>And in the summer it can be turned off when you are going <a href="http://www.example.com/">on holidays to France</a> .</i>

      Perhaps we have a little bit of paint, but in general the texts on the sites for link placement are just that - non-informative, optimized for certain keywords and link texts that are repeated on the page many times.  Often you can see a set of articles that are completely unrelated.  For example, after an article about a blanket, an article about credit cards can be posted, and then about tires.  This is very low-grade content, useless for users. <br><br>  This type of content can be hosted on <a href="http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.ie/2009/09/recommendations-for-webmaster-friendly.html">free hosting</a> or in newly created domains whose names have common keywords.  It can also be found on old sites whose owners have not renewed ownership of their domain.  Google is constantly improving link analysis algorithms.  Even if such methods of creating links initially lead to a positive result, this effect does not last long.  In the end, these links will no longer be taken into account, and the time and money spent on their creation will be wasted. <br><br>  To achieve a sustainable positive result, we advise you to make efforts in another direction.  Create unique and interesting content, actively use social networks and other communities, conduct traditional marketing events, and they will link to you.  Of course, for this you need to make an effort, but as a result you will receive high-quality natural links that will withstand the test of time.  Here are some <a href="http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.ie/2010/06/quality-links-to-your-site.html">tips on how to get quality links</a> . <br><br>  If you are not sure about the quality of your links, <a href="https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/home%3Fhl%3Dru">check backlinks in the Webmaster Tools account</a> .  View all links and their sources.  What is the page that contains links to your site?  Is its content of high quality and useful to users?  Does it relate to the theme of your site?  How was this link obtained?  Is this related to the quality of the content?  If there are many links from low-quality sites or sites containing spam (or any other type of unnecessary links), try removing them.  Links that cannot be deleted can be <a href="http://support.google.com/webmasters/bin/answer.py%3Fhl%3Dru%26answer%3D2648487">rejected</a> in Webmaster Tools. <br><br>  There are other reliable ways of "white" search engine optimization.  For example, a webmaster can make a site more convenient for users and search robots, as well as optimize the <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/%3Fhl%3Dru">speed of the site</a> .  This will achieve the desired results at no extra cost.  If you do not know where to start, refer to our <a href="http://goo.gl/Q3FFG">Search Engine Optimization Guide</a> , where you will find tips on improving your site. <br><br>  If you decide to <a href="http://support.google.com/webmasters/bin/answer.py%3Fhl%3Dru%26answer%3D35291">bring in a search engine optimization specialist</a> to optimize your site, try to make an informed choice and find out what methods he intends to use. <br><br>  As always, you can ask your questions to the participants of our <a href="http://goo.gl/BmbLH">webmaster forum</a> , who will be happy to answer them. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/175643/">https://habr.com/ru/post/175643/</a></p>
