  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Control of inventory in systems 1C</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  By this article, the author would like to raise the issue of the weak points of the typical 1C ‚ÄúSCP, UT, Complex‚Äù systems, methods of eliminating them, and determine the interest of the audience in the problem as a whole. <br>  The first of these addresses the issue of ‚Äúcontrol of commodity balances‚Äù. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>How the system controls the excess residue.</b> <br>  In the terminology of 1C, there are two types of conducting documents <b>Operational</b> and <b>Non-</b> operational implementation. <br>  <b>The operational</b> mode of conducting means that the fact of a business transaction is recorded at the current time and the <b>non-</b> operational mode means that the business operation is reflected in the past, even a second ago from the current time. <br>  I will not reveal the big secret that, in the ideology of typical configurations of 1C programs, it is not considered necessary to check the goods in <b>non-</b> operational mode. <br>  I will not be given right now in the reasons for the lack of full-fledged mechanisms for controlling residues in early versions of systems, I will only note the fact that controlling residues only in operational mode is not very suitable for real workflow.  Often documents are made as they are received and usually backdating. <br><br>  <b>How it works.</b> <br>  In my article, as a basic configuration, I will consider the SCP (management of a manufacturing enterprise) since it contains the largest number of subsystems.  The presented method is also suitable for other 1C systems in which there is a register of ‚ÄúFree residuals‚Äù. <br>  The system contains demo data and the ‚ÄúFree balances‚Äù control mechanism is enabled. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5df/ec0/f61/5dfec0f61dbb2d371c39d7639eaff6ed.png"><br><br>  It is a little about the register <b>Free Remains</b> . <br>  This register appeared in the SCP not so long ago and its appearance is due to the need to consolidate data on commodity balances in one place; it also separated commodity balances from the party registers due to the strategic promotion of RUAZ (extended cost analytics) where the lots were not used. <br>  In the further development of the entire control of commodity balances is based on it.

      But back in our problem.  Having conducted several documents in the past period with a deliberately inflated amount, it can be found that the system does not respond to exceedances. <br><br>  Let's see what really happens. <br>  For all system documents in the posting module, there is a processing residue control block.  Usually it looks like this: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7dd/c4a/1c9/7ddc4a1c96df613788cc817fcea3e8cb.png"><br><br>  All is well.  Control seems to be there.  But falling into the implementation ( <b>F12</b> key).  We see all that is written above.  The system only controls the operating balance. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b25/842/14e/b2584214ee21eabca315208e69e01247.png"><br><br>  The system without control skips most of the documents that were acquired in the past period.  It would be logical to report data errors at the time of its occurrence, when the operator has a primary document on his hands, and not at the time of closing the month, when documents in the archive and to find out the truth is not possible. <br>  Every time starting a completely different project, the first thing that had to close this particular gap in the control of residues.  Only this one action can significantly improve the quality of system data and its usefulness in general. <br>  We supplement the non-operational processing. <br>  Now for the good news. <br>  There is no need to refine anything. All improvements are reduced to 4 lines. <br>  1. Block the exit from the procedure if the conduct is not operational. <br><pre><code class="1c hljs"><span class="hljs-comment"><span class="hljs-comment">//  &lt;&gt; .  // ; //;</span></span></code> </pre> <br>  2. Add a parameter to the request that determines which date we want to receive the balances. <br><pre> <code class="1c hljs"><span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">| ..(&amp;,</span></span></code> </pre><br>  3. Additionally, we pass this parameter to the request. <br><pre> <code class="1c hljs"><span class="hljs-type"><span class="hljs-type"></span></span>.(<span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">""</span></span>, ?(=<span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-class"></span></span>.,<span class="hljs-built_in"><span class="hljs-built_in"></span></span>(),<span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword"></span></span> (..(),<span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-class"></span></span>.)));</code> </pre><br>  We are checking. <br>  Let's form a document in the past period and make sure that the system blocks its implementation when the excess balance is exceeded.  Additionally, we use the report "Analysis of the availability of goods in warehouses." <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/984/ab5/46f/984ab546f19dabea4cfc738b45e1f7dd.png"><br><br>  Findings. <br>  This article covers one of the methods for improving typical 1C systems.  It is told about the methods of holding documents and their features.  It is shown how a few strokes can significantly improve the quality of system data. <br>  Thanks for attention. <br>  PS The solution proposed by the author is characterized by simplicity and accessibility, but does not claim to be 100 percent guaranteed as in the following articles. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/174673/">https://habr.com/ru/post/174673/</a></p>
