  <section class="page js-page"><h1>WD MyBook Live - Standard Feature Extension</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  It is no secret that at this time the presence of several computers at home and other devices working with the network in one way or another (phones, televisions, iptv-set-top boxes, media players, etc) has become for many things the norm.  Usually, in this case, all such hardware is connected to the network with a general Internet connection.  The question arises about some kind of general storage of information, in the role of which a permanently turned on computer, a router with an external disk or a specialized device usually acts.  In general, a NAS is organized in any way, on which family and personal photos, favorite music, films, and many other things already live.  How exactly NAS is organized is a matter of personal choice of everyone.  For example, I purchased <a href="http://www.wdc.com/ru/products/products.aspx%3Fid%3D280">WD My Book Live</a> on 2TB, about which I will lead the further story. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  After reading a few reviews of this device, I found out that ‚Äúinside‚Äù is a full-fledged Debian Linux with the ability to access via ssh.  My joy knew no bounds - not only do I get 2TB of network storage mod my modest needs, so there is still an opportunity to expand the factory functionality, for example, put a web server there, raise my Internet radio, well, everything that comes to mind and implemented in linux.  As a last resort - to collect or write the necessary program most. <br><br>  Reality, as usual, broke the next pair of rose-colored glasses.  To begin with, what's inside is Linux.  Debian 5 Lenny (which is already oldstable).  It cannot be updated, since the support for the SoC iron on which the device itself is implemented may fall off.  Installing the programs I needed was also quite problematic - some of them are either still missing in Debian 5, or have so old versions that I don‚Äôt need any functionality, or they simply don‚Äôt install because the package manager cannot install the dependencies they need without destroying the running system. <br><br>  The result of the ‚Äúautopsy‚Äù turned out to be sad, of course, but not lethal - it's Linux, in it you can solve the same problem in different ways.  My next step was to create a backup copy of the current firmware, so that my experiments would not lead to a software "death" of the device and a trip to the SC, which in my city, it seems, does not exist at all ...

      Having tormented the search engines, I came across an <a href="http://mybookworld.wikidot.com/backup-images-of-mybook">instruction for backing up a backup copy</a> , the main part of which is given here: <br><br>  1) Get ssh access <br>  http: // &lt;IP-OF-YOUR-MYBOOK&gt; / UI / ssh - enter the url by hand, there are no links in the interface <br><br>  2) Go through PuTTY to the device <br>  user = root <br>  password = welc0me <br>  (Of course, you should change the password to your own, with the passwd command) <br><br>  3) Save the MBR and information about the free space at the beginning of the device disk (save quickly, the archive size is 440 bytes): <br><pre><code class="bash hljs">dd <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">if</span></span>=/dev/sda bs=15728640 count=1 | bzip2 &gt; /DataVolume/shares/Public/SDA_MBR_FREESPACE.bz2</code> </pre> <br><br>  4) Save the partitions (there are two of them, since the soft-raid is used) with the current firmware, I warn you, the process is long: <br><pre> <code class="bash hljs">dd <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">if</span></span>=/dev/sda1 | bzip2 &gt; /DataVolume/shares/Public/SDA1_IMA.bz2 dd <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">if</span></span>=/dev/sda2 | bzip2 &gt; /DataVolume/shares/Public/SDA2_IMA.bz2</code> </pre><br><br>  Must give something like: <br>  1 - SDA1_IMA.bz2 file: <br>  3999744 + 0 records in <br>  3999744 + 0 records out <br>  2047868928 bytes (2.0 GB) copied, 2212.34 s, 926 kB / s <br>  filesize = 595MB <br>  2 - SDA2_IMA.bz2: <br>  3999744 + 0 records in <br>  3999744 + 0 records out <br>  2047868928 bytes (2.0 GB) copied, 1914.37 s, 1.1 MB / s <br><br>  5) We merge the received archives on your computer or in another safe place ... <br><br>  So, the backup copy is made and saved on another medium, we will continue. <br><br>  On the site with the backup instruction I <a href="http://mybookworld.wikidot.com/optware">came across the mention of Optware</a> , but mpd from there did not want to work in the broadcast mode, although htop and mc were installed and earned correctly.  Optware seemed to me clearly not enough.  I wanted more. <br><br>  Instructions for auto-installation of various feature-packs I, for some reason, frankly did not like.  Probably by adding an abundance of various web configurators, in which I did not see the need.  At that moment, a thought came to my rather tired head, after which I felt wildly ashamed of the fact that I sometimes consider myself to be a Linux user - chroot. <br><br>  Chroot with a full system inside will allow me to run everything in the repository of the selected distribution!  With a grief in half (for some reason, the Lenny repositories were unstable, and then they stopped giving out the list of packages altogether) I installed <a href="http://wiki.debian.org/Debootstrap">debootstrap</a> , with which I installed normal Debian (testing - in pursuit of "fresh" versions), I wrote scripts that mounted my balls are inside the chrut and they run the services I need. <br><br>  It seems to be all right and I can calm down, but then I remembered that updating the firmware completely erases the entire system partition and destroy all my crutches and supports.  Well, everything I did was transferred to the data section and mounted to the working system via mount --bind, another script was written that returned all the settings to the site, since the firmware update did not remove ssh access. <br><br>  Thinking that other owners of similar glands could have the same problems, I <a href="http://code.google.com/p/mybooklive/">laid out my creation on googlecode</a> with the possibility of easy installation.  Maybe someone will come in handy, although still damp, of course. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/141120/">https://habr.com/ru/post/141120/</a></p>
