    <blockquote>  ‚ÄúAll university programs are very long-term projects at EPAM, a lot of energy has been invested in them, and now it‚Äôs very nice to see how highly this work is evaluated by an international jury.  In Central Europe, no company has such large-scale educational initiatives.  But the most important thing is gratitude from the listeners of these trainings.  We are pleased to help people grow in the profession, develop, we have a lot of experience and we are happy to share it.  This is our contribution to the global market, because these people are competitive in any country in the world. ‚Äù </blockquote><br>  Today, EPAM collaborates with <b>18 universities across the country</b> . <br><br>  For students, we give lectures at universities, conduct laboratory work in our offices, participate in organizing competitions and workshops, supervise production practices.  Those who want to continue to develop can apply for our <a href="https://www.training.by/">training</a> . <br><br>  Our knowledge is the experience of a 25-thousand team, the quintessence of the best solutions to real business problems. <br><br>  But first things first. <br><br>  There are two main areas of cooperation with universities: <b>joint laboratories and branches of departments</b> . <br><br><h3>  <b>What is a branch of the department and why is it needed?</b> </h3><br>  Universities understand that they do not always have time to rewrite curricula for new technologies.  We are interested in the fact that education does not just have time, but also outpaced the demands of the market.  That is why for more than 7 years we have been sharing knowledge and developing the IT community. <br><br>  Experienced coders, BA, testers become teachers for a few hours a week and give lectures to students.  This is not a theory from books, but examples from real projects.  Workshops are carried out in the walls of EPAM. <br><br>  These classes are a full-fledged part of the university program and are automatically available to all students of a particular specialty. <br><br>  In total, the company oversees 13 departments in 6 Belarusian universities.  In the leading universities of the IT-sphere, three departments are open: in BSU production, specialists teach 6 subjects from 2 to 5 years, in BSUIR - 3 subjects from 2 to 4 years of study. <br><br>  Every year, teachers from EPAM at the branches of the departments train from 700 to 1000 students annually. <br><br><h3>  <b>What is a laboratory and why is it needed?</b> </h3><br>  The external laboratory is another educational project.  The company will equip a class in the university, from computers to furniture.  After - the university uses this laboratory during study time, we conduct trainings in the evenings. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/373/66a/cc0/37366acc069a71ec3c85a913189ffc06.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In order to get to the training it is not necessary to be a student.  <a href="https://www.training.by/">Training</a> is an external program where everyone can apply.  But everyone needs to be selected, and he is the same for both the student programmer and the former English teacher. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/10d/542/b6a/10d542b6a3bdc16fbc774c7212e333f4.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>!</b>  <b>Technical interview is not conducted for all trainings.</b> <br><br>  <b>!</b>  <b>The recruiter may ask questions in English.</b> <br><br>  If all stages are completed successfully, you become a student of the laboratory.  Classes are held from 2 to 4 times a week.  Practicing professionals also teach here.  Classes last from one and a half to three months. <br><br>  And this is a real chance, with no experience, to get a first job in IT.  Here they monitor the progress of everyone, assess the questions asked by the listener and his involvement.  It can not be played. <br><br>  When the training is completed (although, of course, you need to continue to study all your life) - the student is invited to the final interview.  This is an opportunity to get an internship in the internal laboratory.  And this stage can hardly be called study in the classical sense: you need to work 5 days a week for 4-8 hours.  Here it is important to show whether you can work in a team, get to know the projects and capabilities of the company closer.  Tasks are as close as possible to "combat".  In the laboratory you will spend about 4 months, each case is individual.  Following the results, another interview is waiting for you, but this time with the project manager, who decides whether he will take you on his team. <br><br>  All steps take an average of six months, but you can go through them faster or slower - it all depends on you. <br><br>  Recruitment for training is ongoing, so the application <a href="https://www.training.by/">can be submitted</a> right now.  All training in EPAM in any direction is <b>free</b> . <br><br><h3>  <b>And some statistics</b> </h3><br>  Similar labs are now open in 4 countries.  In addition to Belarus, students are expected in Kazakhstan, Russia and Ukraine. <br><br>  In 2017, more than 4,200 students passed through these laboratories.  Nearly 2,300 of them received a job offer at EPAM.  Only 13 years of the existence of training laboratories, we have trained <b>17 thousand students</b> . <br><br>  61% of them got jobs at EPAM.  And with it - 25,000 reasons to grow and learn with colleagues around the world. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/348758/">https://habr.com/ru/post/348758/</a></p>
