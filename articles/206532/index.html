I want to share with you a story about how I went to several interviews for the position of "manager" in various companies. <br><br>  I immediately warn you that I am a little over 20 years old, and I can hardly be called a professional in the IT field, but I have quite a lot of experience in IT related fields.  And so we begin. <br><br>  I have a higher business education "In the field of the gambling industry", so that everyone understands why I can not work on the diploma.  I live in a small town that is very far from Moscow.  I am engaged in the fact that I am leading a couple of my portals, where texts are the main value.

      I work as a freelance writer of articles (I will throw a stone at someone who writes texts and calls himself a copywriter), and also partly engages in website promotion and I pray that they will come up with something with spam in the search engine.  I have money that is sufficient for a carefree life, and the prospect of promoting my projects and capturing the whole world. <br><br>  So, the father does not share my lifestyle and believes that I should go to work, work as an employee, get money for work, spend it on creating a family.  It was pointless to argue, and I decided to find a job.  Given the image of a lone wolf, I could afford to work during the day, and I promoted my projects in the evening.  And if there were adequate orders for freelancing, then they.  Having placed my resume on hh, I waited for a miracle. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h3>  Miracle number one.  "A pale young man with burning eyes" </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/25d/fa6/e6e/25dfa6e6e5df4c64a537b5c5520e434b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  I got a call from a local company that has a group of sites through which they sell goods from China (specific to the region).  It was necessary to fill their sites with texts.  At first I thought that they needed a girl on maternity leave, who would be sitting at home filling in the names of the goods.  But no, the requirements were suitable for journal articles with analysis, illustrations, tables, graphs and other set. <br><br>  What distinguishes a good author from a copywriter.  The copywriter writes that he does not know at all.  Well, that's about the same thing, as programmers in Hollywood movies show.  When he opens the command line, writes some kind of nonsense and in 5 seconds hacks the Pentagon.  Most likely, you read such texts of ‚Äútypical copywriters‚Äù with some captain statements and stereotypical presentation of the material.  So, to write a good text you need to understand what you are writing about.  And this takes time to collect and analyze the material. <br><br>  And they offered me to write 12 weighty texts a day, 6 days a week and receive 8300 rubles without official registration.  Perhaps many people do not understand the specifics of the author‚Äôs business, but this is about how to hire a Senior Developer for 100 bucks a month and set him the task of making a Facebook clone in one evening. <br><br>  After I tried to make a smart look with a reasonable look, so as not to show a smile, the employer began to ‚Äúpush‚Äù the speech of a real winner.  He does not need quitters who will sit at work and do nothing.  He needs people who will take the initiative, who themselves will take on the solution of problems.  Leaders who will relate to work as their business, which, if it is necessary to stay at work, but finish their work.  And that's all for 8300 per month.  Super, smile, refuse and move on.  And so, the price for one good text is from 1500-2000 rubles. <br><br><h3>  Miracle number two.  "Even death is not a reason to retreat." </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0df/94a/a19/0df94aa1938d21ad915b3ab9e050c398.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  I got a call from a man who confused me a little.  Solid, calm, but full of epithets from "places not so remote."  He offered to meet and talk, if everything is true, what is written in my resume.  You probably already understood what awaited me. <br><br>  The situation was such that he has a certain business that brings good dividends, but he activated competitors who began to provide the best conditions.  And so he decided to find a person who can not only "convince by force", but also think with his head. <br>  He offered me to head up the ‚Äúimprovement of his business‚Äù, as I am young and I understand all modern gadgets.  In general, the amount offered by him allowed me to forget about high morality. <br><br>  But in his speech, the phrases began to slip: ‚ÄúYou will not have a second chance,‚Äù ‚ÄúI need everything to work out.  You must do, not try, ‚Äù‚Äú You will be responsible for everything with your head, ‚Äùetc.  I decided that such work is not worth it to go to the cement basin to the bottom in case of any deviations. <br><br>  I decided that the cookies on the dark side are not so good.  After my refusal, he began to tell me phrases that are worthy of Al Pacino in the Devil's Advocate: "There are two types of people: one go in front, and the second look them in the ass."  "If you are afraid to lead people, then how can you expect people to follow you." <br><br><h5>  Miracle number three.  ‚ÄúWe have a lot of work!‚Äù </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/af7/f9c/ae1/af7f9cae15cfdb6642c646d9c4d77fdf.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  I was sent to the post by the guy who invited me for an interview.  He recently bought out a closing firm and began to promote it.  More precisely, how to unwind: purchased goods and some equipment and all.  And he realized that he was not very interested in the implementation, and he needed a person who would be responsible for it. <br><br>  He told me that now he has a ‚Äústupid and loafer‚Äù who sits on the phone all the time and does not want to do anything.  He paid him 15 thousand rubles for the work, but the results did not suit him.  The funny thing is that as a businessman, the business owner himself did nothing.  There were no clear instructions, no instructions to the work, but somehow everything was invented by myself, but if you do something wrong, then all the losses are deducted from you. <br><br>  <b>And what were the official obligations:</b> <br><br>  1) Maintenance of the company: special equipment, test bench, company website (system administrator in one word). <br>  2) Filling the site with content.  (Texts, photos, description of the goods - all by myself). <br>  3) Work with the incoming channel of consumers. <br>  4) Active customer search by means of: state.  tenders, work with networks, work with SEO, SMM, publications and collaboration with portals. <br>  5) Preparation of contracts, catalogs, promotional materials, press kits and other literature. <br>  6) Conducting accounting statements and invoicing by bank transfer. <br>  7) Organization of warehouse space.  Participation in the unloading of goods. <br>  8) Work with transport companies and private drivers. <br>  9) Receipt of goods from suppliers, testing of incoming goods, work with return and claims. <br>  10) Organization of office cleaning and work with the documentation for the rental and the Internet. <br><br>  And this is all for 15 thousand rubles.  To be honest, I know few entrepreneurs who agree to do this amount of work on their own.  And this, given that they take every ruble of profit for themselves.  And here everything is in one hand and for pennies. <br><br>  After my refusal, he somehow became sad and offended at me.  That's what I am so bad, I do not agree to work in such a cool company for the sake of its bright future. <br><br><h3>  Miracle number four.  ‚ÄúMore Words, Less Things‚Äù </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d5a/51e/689/d5a51e689eca316e5f3bcde9bed95a26.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  I got a call from a friend who, in his time, earned a good deal on a dill in the form of building a network of doorways and other nonsense.  And now he got a job as a developer in a firm that planned to release specialized software.  He said that with them all the development stopped and does not go, because the owner of the company can not perform the duties of a project manager. <br><br>  The situation is as follows: a narrow and very specific niche.  It is necessary to develop software for specialists in this field.  No one except specialists from this field understands how document flow and other processes should take place.  The owner of the company is an expert from this sphere, but he cannot or does not want to explain.  Calls all programmers rams who do not understand the obvious things, and can not do anything.  And the developers actually ran in a circle, not giving results, but receiving a salary.  It suited them. <br><br>  I was offered to become a project manager and satisfy the requirements of the project sponsor.  After spending a week sitting behind the documentation on a large drawing paper with a pencil, I was able to create an approximate step-by-step algorithm for the operation of the service.  But since I did not know all the specifics, I needed to clarify all points with the owner of the company. <br><br>  But all my questions were followed by phrases like: "Are you that stupid?", "You don't understand anything."  In general, he sat and pulled into his pants on their importance.  I decided that I was not going to tolerate such an attitude towards myself and left. <br><br><h3>  Results: </h3><br>  - I realized that without a clear technical specialization in the West there is nothing to do.  Since it requires good specialists, not a jack of all trades. <br>  - The situation with work in the regions is now hellish, since ‚Äúthere is a lot of work‚Äù, and the requirements are at the level of Google, with wages, like polomoyka. <br>  - I decided to continue to sit at home, do my own projects and write texts for freelancing. <br><br>  I hope you do not have to deal with such employers. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/206532/">https://habr.com/ru/post/206532/</a></p>
