      Under the cut, we will once again briefly describe what the event was devoted to this year, for those of you who have not seen our previous invitation. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/6c6/f28/6f0/6c6f286f0f08aa049323c93f14c0b811.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>What and for whom is this Forum</b> <br>  Together with our partners, we will tell you about the four major trends of today's market and how to use them to give a new impetus to the development of your business. <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Transform</b> </li></ul>  Until now, we have seen a steady increase in the performance of computing resources and storage systems, as well as network bandwidth; .  The primary task is to organize the management of applications in such a way as to ensure their quick and secure deployment on new platforms or in the cloud, without affecting the core business of the enterprise. <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Inform</b> </li></ul>  The development of enterprises leads to an increase in the amount of data that must be stored and processed in the data center, the task of quickly extracting useful information from increasing amounts of information using standardized hardware and software for users who do not have special skills.  How can organizations cope with data growth, the speed of new data, the variety of data sources and the benefits that all this data can bring to the enterprise? <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Protect</b> </li></ul>  Maintaining confidentiality and compliance with laws and regulations are critical tasks for each company.  Organizations of any size are constantly at risk: one message on the social network is enough to let the whole world know about their secrets.  In 79% of the surveyed companies, some kind of information security breach occurred last year.  For businesses that do not care about protecting their systems in advance, data loss costs an average of $ 1.1 billion. <br>  The risk is even greater because data access can be obtained anytime and anywhere, while fewer access points are controlled by the company.  At the same time, legal requirements for personnel and systems are becoming tougher. <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Connect</b> </li></ul>  According to Gartner, in the next ten years, the most important trend in the field of information technology will be consumer orientation.  This trend is due to the emergence of simple, affordable and common technologies that allow people to work on their mobile phones, tablets, laptops or personal computers anytime and anywhere.  In order for the IT department to control such devices and protect the organization from security breaches, it will need a single set of tools for managing mobile devices, managing applications, protecting data, and ensuring information security. <br><br>  We will dedicate the Dell Solutions Forum day to discussing these four trends, as well as offering solutions ‚Äî technologies, methods, strategies ‚Äî that will help you tick the box below: <br><ul><li>  get the most out of your organization using the BYOD model; </li><li>  accelerate the processes of virtualization, convergence and transition to cloud technologies; </li><li>  turn corporate data into a valuable asset; </li><li>  provide comprehensive protection of IT infrastructure and its compliance with industry standards. </li></ul><br>  Like last year, the Dell Solutions Forum will be most useful and interesting to those who make decisions in the field of IT, including CIOs / CIOs, heads of IT departments, consultants from system integrators. <br><br>  During the Forum, you can chat with Dell experts, colleagues, and partners, both in thematic sessions and in informal meetings. <br><br>  Who will perform?  Of course, the Russian and European representatives of Dell, our partners (Microsoft, Intel, VMWare, etc.), as well as customers with their cases and success stories.  Also the <a href="http://www.dsf2013.ru/ehome/71559/agenda">detailed program of the day of the Forum</a> will help to answer this question. <br><br>  <b>How will it all go</b> <br>  The whole program of the day is divided into two large blocks. <br><br>  In the morning, from 10:00 to 13:00, we will hold several general lectures with Dell representatives, experts and partners. <br><br>  In the afternoon, from 2:30 pm to 5:00 pm, we will divide into groups and work on parallel thematic sections, each of which will be devoted to discussing one of the four main trends of the current market. <br><br>  Well, after 17:00 - <s>dancing!</s>  An informal cocktail party where you can chat with friends, colleagues and competitors (if you want, of course) and share your impressions of the day. <br><br>  <b>How to get to the Forum</b> <br>  To apply for participation in the forum, click <a href="http://goo.gl/jlFqv3">on this link</a> and register.  Do not forget to indicate that you learned about the forum through social networks (point ‚Äúwww.habrahabr.ru‚Äù in the application).  As we process applications, we will confirm invitations. <br><br>  If for some reason you don‚Äôt succeed in getting to the Forum (by the way, the earlier you submit an application, the greater the chance of success), it will be insulting, but not terrible - a report on the results of the Forum with materials will be published in our blog. <br><br>  And yes.  Participation in the Forum, as a year ago, is free. <br><br>  If you have questions, ask in their comments or you can directly contact your Dell representative, <a href="">Marat Rakayev</a> . <br><br>  <b>Fastening material</b> <br>  <b>What:</b> Dell Solutions Forum 2013. <br>  <b>When:</b> October 17, 2013, Thursday, from 09:00 to 19:00. <br>  <b>Where:</b> Moscow, Radisson SAS Slavyanskaya Hotel, Moscow, pl.  Europe, d. 2 (m. "Kiev"). <br>  <b>How much:</b> for free. <br>  <b>How to:</b> register <a href="http://goo.gl/jlFqv3">here</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/196338/">https://habr.com/ru/post/196338/</a></p>
