  <section class="page js-page"><h1>If you are in Kazan or Novosibirsk and you want to design chips like in Cupertino</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Lord  In the photo, Irina, a girl from Novosibirsk, is considering a museum exhibit about personal computers of the 1980s.  It was then, in the 1980s, that there was finally a rather unpleasant gap between Western electronics and Soviet.  If in the 1970s, Soviet electronics just lagged behind at 7 years (judging by the release dates of DEC PDP-11 and SM-4), then in the 386th region, it just died. <br><br>  At the same time, in the late 1980s, logical synthesis technology from Verilog and VHDL hardware description languages ‚Äã‚Äãappeared in the West.  This technology became mainstream in the 1990s and ultimately led to iPhones and neuro-accelerators in the 21st century.  Logical synthesis was introduced in all sorts of MIT and Stanford, along with labs on FPGAs in the 1990s, but in Russia and Ukraine of that time, defeatism and disbelief in Russian electronics led us to fix the situation now. <br><br>  In order to build an electronics development ecosystem in Russia, with hundreds of companies, not a dozen, as it is now, you need to do what the USA did in the 1990s and now they do in China: to learn a bunch of young engineers to understand the principles of logical design of digital circuits register transfer level.  Even if not all of them will design microprocessors and network chips, and half will go into pure programming, this knowledge will not be wasted: the time to increase the speed of computers by reducing transistors is coming to an end, and everywhere there are hybrid software-hardware solutions with specialized hardware computing blocks - John Hennessy, the chairman of the board of directors of Alphabet / Google, even made a speech about this recently.

Held from 2 to 5 October 2018 in the Novosibirsk State Technical University. <br><br>  Contact: Makukha Vladimir Karpovich, makukha@epu.ref.nstu.ru. <br></blockquote>  For this school, Vladimir Makukha invites Stanislav Zelio, an engineer who is currently designing Russian neuro accelerators and network chips at IVA Technologies.  Stanislav will use materials that in the past few years have translated, developed and implemented a group of Russian and Ukrainian teachers (MEPI, ITMO, KPI, etc.), Russian engineers of American companies, etc. into Russian education. <br><br>  Here is what Stanislav plans to show in Novosibirsk: <br><blockquote>  The program of the event: <br>  Total duration: 4 days for 8-10 hours. <br>  Day 1. Introduction to digital circuitry.  Simulation and synthesis.  Basics of make, Modelsim, Icarus Verilog, Intel Quartus Prime, Xilinx Vivado.  Combination logic.  Multiplexer  Practical task. <br>  Day 2. Sequential logic.  D-trigger  Registers.  Metastability.  Practical task. <br>  Day 3. State machines.  Practical task.  Basics of pipelining. <br>  Day 4. Architecture.  Assembler  The simplest processor core schoolMIPS.  Microarchitecture.  Practical task. <br><br>  Recommendation for students: <br>  Before attending the course, read the sections Harris &amp; Harris ("Digital Circuit Design and Computer Architecture"): 1.3-1.5, 2.4-2.5, 2.8-2.9, 3, 4, 5.1-5.4, 6.1-6.6, 7.1-7.3, or better - chapters 1- 7 or the whole book. <br><br>  The program is preliminary.  In the process we will make adjustments. <br>  The practice-oriented course: in 4 days it is physically impossible to give everything that is in Harris &amp; Harris.  Therefore, I set myself the goal of giving them the theory necessary for understanding the practice.  Plus show an approach to development (make and non-project mode), which greatly simplifies the work, but about which people most often learn from fellow developers. <br></blockquote>  Stanislav will also use lecture slides, which I read on Skype from California to 150 students of Kazan Innopolis - first in January-February, and then recently.  The rector of Kazan Innopolis Alexander Tormasov asked me to do the lecture in English, since they have foreign students.  But in Novosibirsk everything will be in Russian.  These slides are: <a href="http://bit.ly/2018-01-25-verilog-1-innopolis-yuri-panchul">Lecture 1</a> , <a href="http://bit.ly/2018-02-01-verilog-2-innopolis-yuri-panchul">Lecture 2</a> . <br><br>  Examples Stanislav holds <a href="https://github.com/zhelnio/ddec">on githaba</a> . <br><br>  Here is about a similar school at Tomsk State University last year: <a href="https://habr.com/post/345286/">Severe Siberian and Kazakh microelectronics in 2017: Verilog, ASIC and FPGA in Tomsk, Novosibirsk and Astana</a> . <br><br>  But the photos of young people from St. Petersburg, who learned the design on the FPGA and won the European finals and second place in the world finals of the Intel InnovateFPGA competition.  In August, Intel invited them to Silicon Valley.  In their time, they also began with exercises like those that will be in Novosibirsk: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a44/136/35e/a4413635eb359ee6375dccd425eeca86.jpg"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/423843/">https://habr.com/ru/post/423843/</a></p>
