Hi, Randy! </h4><br>  Hello! <br><br><h4>  Randy, you came to Moscow to speak at DevGAMM.  Your report was yesterday ... or the day before yesterday.  (A couple of days ago) What did you talk about at the show? </h4><br>  I talked about different things.  DevGAMM had Russian game developers, mostly indie developers, like Gearbox.  The best I could do was share the experience I gained in my work.  The one that helped Gearbox achieve current results.  That would be useful to the audience. <br><br>  I talked a little about Gearbox history, a little about my entertainment philosophy and relationships that we need to maintain with the audience.  He told about our values, our mission, that they are used by me and my company as a guiding star.  So that we can always understand where we are going and what our goals are.  It really helps us for 20 years.  Gearbox Studios is already 20 years old, and this is a great achievement for a game developer. <br><br><h4>  Oh cool.  I'm a little surprised, because I read that you will talk about Borderlands 3, but you talked about game developers for young developers ... unexpectedly! </h4><br>  Of course, I talked about Borderlands 3, I even showed a trailer. <br><br><a name="1"></a><h2>  <font color="#3AC1EF">Borderlands as a perfect hybrid.</font>  <font color="#3AC1EF">Randy and Nikolai</font> </h2><br><h4>  I was going to ask you about the Borderlands, (of course, ask about the Borderlands) but since we talked more about the industry, let's start with that. </h4><br>  At the speech, I presented Borderlands as the highest grossing project of Gearbox.  In many ways, Borderlands has become a transitional project for us, allowing us to grow and try new things - for example, to become a publisher.  Prior to Borderlands, Gearbox depended entirely on other publishers who supported us and helped reach the audience.  But with Borderlands, we have the capacity and resources to come to the audience directly and help others do it as a publisher.  This includes various activities - from marketing to production and distribution of physical copies of games in stores, direct interaction with different platforms: Steam, Xbox, Playstation, Nintendo.  And of course, Apple, Google, and indeed with all the platforms where they play games.  Borderlands became a kind of pivot point with which we achieved the right balance. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9a6/54c/949/9a654c9499e13285bbbc9878beb15a92.jpg"></div><br><h4>  Tell us, did you start the Borderlands from scratch?  Have you invented it entirely, its whole world? </h4><br>  Well, this is teamwork.  It all started with an idea.  She did not appear in the offices of Gearbox, she was in my head and among those who came to Gearbox.  The idea was this.  All fan first-person shooter is made up of individual episodes.  It occurs at specific moments of the game, when you move, dodge, aim, shoot at a target, see the result.  This fun comes in bursts, and at such times you like to play first-person shooter. <br><br>  But there are completely different games.  I loved these games before Wolfenstein 3D changed everything for me.  I'm talking about role-playing games.  In them, the fun never concentrated in specific moments, it was with you all the time - when you received new levels, experience, equipment.  For example ... did you play Diablo? <br><br><h4>  Yes of course. </h4><br>  For me, Diablo is a graphic version of one of my favorite games, Hack.  Or NetHack.  In it, directly with the help of text symbols, you drew a hero and monsters in dungeons.  The plus sign was a door, and when you opened the door, there was another door behind it or something else. <br><br><h4>  This is similar to the next generation of text quests. </h4><br>  Yes it is.  Think about the principle of the game in Diablo?  You move the cursor, press the buttons.  Just like when you move the cursor on the desktop and click the icons.  In Diablo, the whole point is not in motion, but in getting new things, getting stronger, discovering something new. <br><br>  And that's what I thought.  Fan first-person shooter - aim, dodge, shoot.  He does not exclude the fan of role-playing games, more long-playing.  You can connect episodic and long-playing fan together in one game.  This was the beginning of the Borderlands. <br><br>  All the games I worked on in their concept combine some history, style and design.  Sometimes it all starts with a story ‚Äî like, for example, Brothers in Arms.  What if we became soldiers of World War II and fought with other soldiers?  It all started with a story, and then style and design were brought up.  Sometimes it all starts with style ... did you play in Mirror's Edge? <br><br><h4>  Yes, I adore Mirror's Edge.  I do not like Catalyst, it sucks, but the original Mirror's Edge is great. </h4><br>  I think ... I do not know for sure, but I suppose that this game began with style.  Rendering and art direction pulled the design and history behind them.  I did not work on this project, but I think that this was the case.  The idea is that the idea can start with one element, and the rest will follow.  In Borderlands, everything exactly began with design, with the principle of combining a first-person shooter and role-playing game.  It was as if Doom had met Hack.  Or Halo with Diablo, if we talk about more modern games.  Nobody did that before.  And we thought that we could do it, that it needed to be done.  The universe and history have already appeared after him, as well as style. <br><br>  If we make a first-person shooter, and part of the game is to kill everyone and pick up their belongings, then we need to make sure that you remain a good guy.  And the Borderlands universe allows it.  We combine science fiction and western. <br><br><h4>  Yes, western.  I thought it was some kind of futuristic western. </h4><br>  I was asked why the game is called Borderlands.  It makes no sense.  When we imagine what Borderlands means in English, it does not appear as a planet.  This is part of some place.  But I called the game so not because I wanted to show exactly this place.  I put a broader meaning.  The story and the universe of the game lie between science fiction and the western. <br><br><h4>  That's the problem‚Ä¶ </h4><br>  And in terms of game design, Borderlands is between the role-playing game and the shooter.  Even her style is also in a borderline position, between the realistic and the surreal.  The art direction is fantastic, it's almost a graphic novel.  But at the same time everything is absolutely according to the rules of the game universe.  You start and immediately feel the universe with style. <br><br>  In general, a borderland is such an uncomfortable, uncomfortable position between two things.  For example, there is a road, and grass grows along the road.  In some places the road cracked, the asphalt crumbled and grass made its way through it.  And this part is more like a road, the road is broken.  But it is also not grass, there is both here and there.  Something third, and his name is borderlands. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1db/6e1/b19/1db6e1b19e09263de9374851acf9baec.jpg"></div><br><br><h4>  <font color="#78a2b7">Oh, you explained how cool and lively I now understand more.</font>  <font color="#78a2b7">Maybe you should go back to Borderlands 2 (thanks!) And play it before leaving Borderlands 3.</font> </h4><br>  We made Borderlands 3 so that you can play it, even if you don't know what happened before.  If you are a fan of Borderlands, then you will find many discoveries.  If you‚Äôve never played Borderlands before, we‚Äôll take care of you.  We made it so that people who had not played before in Borderlands, plunged into the game as if they did not miss anything.  They are perfectly mastered and live a new story.  But if you have played in the Borderlands before, the characters and the universe will give you more. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6ff/1c7/0c2/6ff1c70c2fb10eb98669e7d60e8ce8a7.jpg"></div><br>  So if you have not played Borderlands 2, then I recommend: it is very fun!  In such matters, I use my wife as a litmus test.  She is a gamer, but she doesn't always like the games I do.  We work in a team, and there are a lot of amazingly talented people around me.  I am proud to work with them, that we do something as a team.  But sometimes something that does one does not like another.  Some like some games, others like other games.  And I felt that we did it when my wife - and she is a fan of Borderlands, went through the second part six or seven times - in the last two weeks she returned to the first Borderlands and began to replay, now several times. <br><br><h4>  <font color="#78a2b7">Oh, here is a fan!</font> </h4><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/69c/001/05d/69c00105de12f5fa3df76d9178ddbb2b.jpg"></div><br>  Yes, it's awesome when your wife likes what you work on with the team.  But this is not always the case, this is not always the case. <br><br><h4>  <font color="#78a2b7">Let's continue about Borderlands, but let's move on to more controversial issues.</font>  <font color="#78a2b7">I know that you will release Borderlands 3 on the Epic Store, and only six months later there will be a release on Steam.</font>  <font color="#78a2b7">Tell me why you decided to do this?</font>  <font color="#78a2b7">As far as I know, you can sell much more on Steam.</font>  <font color="#78a2b7">Why did you decide to make it exclusive for six months?</font> </h4><br>  I do not want to upset you, but this is not my decision.  The game is published by 2K Games, it has publishing rights.  and 2K Games is Take-Two Interactive brand.  My company is Gearbox Software, we own the Borderlands, and we created the game.  But the publishing license belongs to 2K, and they decide where the game will be published, on which platforms. <br><br>  They decided to enter into an exclusive agreement with Epic.  Take-Two - public company;  at least it was when I checked it.  They are businessmen, unlike us, artists and creatives.  They love to make money.  I‚Äôm sure they did this because it was the best way to make money.  I also think that they work in the interests of buyers.  A business like 2K cannot be successful without taking into account the interests of customers.  I think many more factors are involved. <br><br>  As for me ... I am not upset about their decision.  I remember when Steam was launched, and many were against it.  I remember how I bought Half-Life 2, and I could not play it until I installed Steam and went online.  Changes are hard to come by, in life everything goes by inertia. <br><br>  Do you know what inertia is?  This is a scientific term, it has two meanings.  If the object moves, then by inertia it will continue to move.  If it stands still, it will.  And it suits everyone.  But inertia works not only in physics, but also in our character, in personality and in activities.  Many people fear change.  But without change the future does not come.  So it will be fun.  Anyone who wants to play, in the end can do it on any desired platform. <br><br>  I remember when we did Borderlands 2 ... or 1 ... the main complaint was that we do not have a version for Linux.  We made Borderlands 2 for Linux!  The number of people who played this version ... very upset.  Very little.  I do not know if this example is appropriate, but it seems to me that if people are interested in content, they will search for it and find it, wherever it is.  Let's see what happens.  I want everyone to play our game.  As a creator, I want everyone to try it, because this is our mission in the world of entertainment. <br><br>  In general, I am often visited by such paradoxical thoughts.  On the one hand, I have to be at the forefront, motivate for change.  On the other - I just want people to have fun, this is what gives meaning to me and my company.  Let's see what will happen. <br><br><a name="2"></a><h2>  <font color="#3AC1EF">Addons to Half Life, or how we shuffled the protagonists.</font>  <font color="#3AC1EF">Randy and Nikolai</font> </h2><br><h4>  <font color="#78a2b7">You did Borderlands, where you had free rein, but at the beginning of Gearbox history, you made two games in the Half-Life universe, the Opposing Force and Blue Shift.</font>  <font color="#78a2b7">Here you have already been limited to a ready-made setting.</font>  <font color="#78a2b7">The plot, too, I think, was almost ready, all the characters.</font>  <font color="#78a2b7">But you did something cool, even twice - Opposing Force, Blue Shift.</font>  <font color="#78a2b7">These games were similar, but people liked it, and they bought both.</font>  <font color="#78a2b7">How could you do it in such conditions?</font> </h4><br>  It was so fun.  Half Life itself, history, art, content - everything was beautiful.  This work was a privilege for us, we were very pleased.  When we first started, I went to Valve and threw an idea to them: what if we play on behalf of opponents, a soldier?  Not on behalf of Gordon and scientists, but on behalf of those people who broke in and should destroy everything? <br><br>  I liked the idea and sent me to Sierra Online - then the rights to Half-Life belonged to them.  Here the idea also came, we made an agreement and now we could do what we want.  We were able to pack our ideas into the world of Half Life, we loved Half-Life and wanted to do everything very carefully.  Of course, our progress was observed from the outside.  And if we did something that nobody would like, or were not consistent enough, then the project would probably be interrupted.  But almost no one indicated anything to us, there were almost no restrictions. <br><br>  I want to remember also the third game in the Half-Life universe - Half-Life: Decay. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7b9/657/7c3/7b96577c3be5ac52522757c84269ff8d.png"></div><br><h4>  <font color="#78a2b7">Did he come out for PS2?</font> </h4><br>  Yes, she was cooperative and came out for PS2.  It was fun.  In Opposing Force you were a soldier, in Blue Shift - a security guard, and in Decay I wanted ... did you play Half Life? <br><br><h4>  <font color="#78a2b7">Yes of course.</font> </h4><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/db3/ff8/509/db3ff85090dca1c356958ff3c5e5cf29.jpg"></div><br>  Remember when Gordon Freeman gets a HEV suit?  There are three capsules, and only in the center there is a suit, and the two extreme ones are empty.  Who took these costumes?  In Decay, you play for those who took them.  You already know one character - this is Gordon's trainer, Gina.  She was present earlier in the form of a hologram, but a real person was hidden behind her.  One costume was with her, and the other was with a new character, Colette Green.  The two remaining costumes were Gina and Colette.  In Half Life: Decay was a cooperative game - one played for Gina, the other for Colette.  We could play together, solve puzzles to go on. <br><br><h4>  <font color="#78a2b7">Together on the same screen?</font> </h4><br>  Yes, on a single screen, divided, this is a console game.  We saw each other, but the screen was divided.  I do not remember, horizontally or vertically, it seems we were giving a choice. <br><br><h4>  <font color="#78a2b7">Oh, that's great.</font> </h4><br>  We did everything consistently.  Remember when, at the beginning, Gordon slides the sample into the reactor, and this causes a cascade resonance that has created a breakthrough between our world and the world of Zen.  The sample rises from the bottom through the elevator.  In Decay, you become a scientist who delivers a sample to Gordon.  You're down!  You prepare the sample, push it in, press the button, the sample rises - and you can hear everything happening from the side. <br><br><h4>  <font color="#78a2b7">That is a cool story from any point of view.</font> </h4><br>  Yes, we had a lot of fun making it all.  You see the story from different perspectives, it turned out a real crossover.  When we started Gearbox, our first project was Half Life: Opposing Force.  There were only five of us, and by the time the game appeared in stores, it was already twelve. <br><br><h4>  <font color="#78a2b7">Good growth!</font> </h4><br>  Imagine.  We are 12 people.  In the Opposing Force there seemed to be 45 cards.  The original Half-Life was 88 or so.  The Opposing Force addon was half the size of a Valve game.  Valve had 40-50 people, and they spent 3 years on the game.  We finished in 8 months with 12 people.  Incredible.  Each of us played different roles at once.  I was a screenwriter, designer, producer and director.  About a third of the levels I did myself as a level designer.  The game had terrible code and scary textures that I made myself.  The cool people on our team did a great job, for example, Stephen Bal made all the soldiers and about two thirds of all the monsters and weapons.  Several types of monsters and weapons made Landon, along with some textures.  Brian also created monsters, as well as many textures that we used later.  Rob made a lot of sound effects that we used - and he was also a left-handed designer, made about a fifth of all levels.  Everyone did everything. <br><br><h4>  <font color="#78a2b7">Indie studios at the beginning of their history - this is complete madness.</font>  <font color="#78a2b7">How do you think how many things everyone does ...</font> </h4><br>  Yes, and today 400 people work on Borderlands 3.  The scale is great, and we are working on the game ... the first time I did something for the third part five years ago.  The scale is completely different. <br><br><a name="3"></a><h2>  <font color="#3AC1EF">Duke Nukem Forever is a game that should not have come out.</font>  <font color="#3AC1EF">Randy and Nikolai</font> </h2><br><h4>  <font color="#78a2b7">Okay, let's talk about another old title - Duke Nukem.</font>  <font color="#78a2b7">Everyone was waiting for the new Duke Nukem from the very release of Duke Nukem 3D, rather, soon, rather, but Duke Nukem Forever was released only in 2011.</font> </h4><br>  Yes, it was almost "forever".  Not really, but almost. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8cc/990/906/8cc990906502b24349e4057b5c7e8027.jpg"></div><br><h4>  <font color="#78a2b7">In 2011, the game came out and received ... mixed reviews.</font> </h4><br>  I would not even say mixed, the reviews were pretty bad.  It was a crazy situation.  I left 3D Realms in 1997 ... yes, in 1997, and we‚Äôve been working on Duke Nukem Forever for several months.  I left 3D Realms, joined another company, the company went broke, then I founded Gearbox.  The whole company managed to open and go broke.  In 1999, I founded Gearbox.  We developed all the Half Life games, all versions for different platforms, all add-ons, James Bond game, Tony Hawk's ProSkater game, Samba de Amigo, Halo for PC, Brothers in Arms, Borderlands.  They did all this while 3D Realms continued to work on Duke Nukem: Forever.  Throughout the history of Gearbox, even after the release of Borderlands, 3D Realms worked on Duke Nukem: Forever. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0c9/284/68d/0c928468dcdf1556da103962d267ab08.jpg"></div><br>  I remember when I was still working in 1997 in 3D Realms, we were developing another game - Prey.  She used a new technology that was just emerging - a graphic 3D accelerator.  This is the board that you inserted into the PC, and it accelerated the 3D graphics.  Prior to this, everything was processed by the processor at the software level.  When I got my first 3dfx graphics card, I thought: this is incredible!  I launched the original Tomb Raider and thought: wow!  3D graphics!  I had a Matrox video card, and I ran one of the versions of Quake on it.  As a developer, I needed Matrox cards. <br><br>  I remember, we somehow worked on Duke Nukem: Forever - I was actually not in the team at that time.  We only got 3dfx and Matrox.  And at one point, it was then decided: we will make Prey for 3D maps, but Duke Nukem will be released earlier and will be adapted for software rendering for now.  Imagine: 3dfx appeared, gave a good start to the industry of 3D-cards, passed the whole development cycle and was eliminated.  3dfx no longer existed as a company, all within the Duke Nukem: Forever development cycle. <br><br>  I remember at the dawn of Gearbox in Wired magazine - do you have a Wired in Russia?  - then Wired used the term "vaporware".  ‚ÄúVapor‚Äù is about something that really isn't, like a ghost.  And "ware" is from software.  Vaporware is a software that was promised, still ghostly and unreal.  Someone wrote an article about Duke Nukem and called it ‚Äúvaporware‚Äù.  Now this term may already be in the dictionaries, it is settled. <br><br>  The following year, <a href="https://www.wired.com/2011/06/duke-nukem-forever-review/">Wired</a> made a new article entitled ‚ÄúVaporware of the Year Awards‚Äù.  They made an award that was given to all the developers of such software.  There was a lot of awards for technical, specialized software.  Wired talked about one vapoware, a friend, a third one and so on until the end of the article, where they presented the ‚ÄúNo. 1 Vaporware of the Year Award‚Äù award ... Duke Nukem: Forever. <br><br><h4>  <font color="#78a2b7">This is victory.</font> </h4><br>  They handed it to Duke Nukem the following year.  And a year later.  And a year later, for now ... <br><br><h4>  <font color="#78a2b7">How many did they award the Duke Nukem award?</font> </h4><br>  10 years!  A whole decade!  And after 10 years in Wired they wrote: we give Duke Nukem: Forever a lifetime reward, we will not talk about it anymore, this is the king of vaporware, which no one will overthrow.  Yes, Duke will not do anything in half and even among the vaporware will be king. <br><br><h4>  <font color="#78a2b7">But he still came out.</font> </h4><br>  Yes, even though this should not happen.  The guys ran out of money, and they closed. <br><br><h4>  <font color="#78a2b7">So what is the reason that the game is badly accepted?</font> </h4><br>  I think it's all about expectations.  Well, in the game itself.  It reflects the history of its creation.  I am not objective: I believe that I owe much of my Duke Nukem career.  When I joined the Duke Nukem 3D team in 1996, it was my first commercial game.  When I was working on Duke Nukem Plutonium Pak and Atomic Edition, which were shipped in a bundle, these were my first commercial games.  I worked in 3D Realms just a year before I set up my company, but I felt I owed it a lot.  I can not be objective. <br><br>  When 3D Realms closed and left the employees with nothing, the company management thought that you could just raise your hands and say "well, that's all."  But the publishers - we had previously discussed the difference, the publishers are promoting the game, deciding where to sell it and are interested in money - the publishers began the trial with 3D Realms, with George Broussard and Scott Miller.  It was impossible to just get up and leave. <br><br><h4>  <font color="#78a2b7">And who was the publisher?</font> </h4><br>  Take-Two, as well as Borderlands.  They filed a lawsuit against George Broussard and Scott Miller.  ‚ÄúYou can't just go and leave.  We have invested millions in this game. ‚Äù  You have obligations. <br><br><h4>  <font color="#78a2b7">It's almost 15 years to invest!</font>  <font color="#78a2b7">And then they just quit!</font> </h4><br>  Yes, the development took 15 years, and Scott and George thought they could just drop everything.  But there was a problem.  They made a deal and pledged to make the game - but did not make it.  In addition, they personally took a lot of money from Take-Two, a lot of money.  Take-Two said that the money must be returned, but the guys have already spent the money. <br><br>  So, 3D Realms has problems.  Big problems.  We started discussing them with George and Scott. <br><br><h4>  <font color="#78a2b7">You said you already left 3D Realms.</font>  <font color="#78a2b7">What was your role?</font> </h4><br>  Yes, I already worked at Gearbox, it was 2009 or 2010. <br><br><h4>  <font color="#78a2b7">What was the gearbox role here?</font> </h4><br>  No.  Absolutely none, since I left 3D Realms in 1997 until the time when George, Scott and I sat down in 2010 to discuss the closure of Gearbox.  George and Scott had problems.  They got a lawsuit and needed help. <br><br>  What I felt about this.  Imagine yourself driving alone on a highway in Siberia.  No one for miles around.  And suddenly you see a car accident: fire, blood, corpses.  What will you do?  Stop or go further? <br><br><h4>  <font color="#78a2b7">Of course I will stop!</font>  <font color="#78a2b7">People need help!</font> </h4><br>  Of course, most will stop.  Now imagine: you recognize the car, and this is the car of people close to you.  For example, your first boss who sent you to the profession.  And while you head a whole column - an ambulance, tractor, utility vehicles.  There is no one around. <br><br>  That was us.  We have agreed that I undertake obligations under the claim to them.  I went under the bullets.  Take-Two no longer suing 3D Realms, George Broussard and Scott Miller.  They sued me. <br><br><h4>  <font color="#78a2b7">Brave step!</font> </h4><br>  I relied on two things.  The first is my relationship with Take-Two, because they have already published Borderlands, which has become a big hit.  I thought that in this situation they would go forward.  I knew that Take-Two wanted the game.  And I knew something else - Scott and George in a personal meeting told me that.  They fired all-all developers and shut down the company.  But there are a lot of people in the team, and they have been working on Duke Nukem for more than 10 years.  They devoted themselves entirely to this game.  And what happened was not their fault - George and Scott did not know how to handle the money and were forced to dismiss them.  It was a big surprise for everyone. <br><br>  But no one wanted to throw.  Everyone was eager to make a game.  And some guys still had money to continue - even without a salary.  And one of the employees - Allen Bloom, who stood at the origins of Duke Nukem even when it was a side-scroller - he, producer David Rigal, and several other guys continued to work.  They were fired from the studio, the studio was destroyed, they did not have access to work computers.  They took computers from home, brought them to someone, set up and continued to work. <br><br><h4>  <font color="#78a2b7">Wow!</font>  <font color="#78a2b7">Home studio!</font> </h4><br>  Almost half of the staff did this.  I do not remember the exact figure, but they continued to work.  And you know what you did?  They sewed together everything that they had and got the game, with the beginning, the end, the middle and all the necessary content. <br><br>  And they let me play.  I played.  And it was pretty cool!  I could not even believe that this game exists, because for me Duke Nukem was the one that helped me get into the industry in 1997.  I looked at the new Duke and understood - here he is!  I did not expect anything like it.  I know how to make games, I know how difficult it is for a 3D Realms company to compete in the market. <br><br>  I thought it would be a nightmare, but when I played, I saw something cool there.  It was fun to play!  It was Duke Nukem.  I could not believe that I play it.  My expectations were about here [shows], and the game was at this level [shows].  For me it was wow! <br><br>  The condition that Take-Two will take the claim was that the game will appear in stores.  So we needed producers.  We signed a contract with the producers to finish the work - and they finished!  Our producers and their developers have finished the game.  When you run it, you see "Gearbox Software presents a 3D Realms game" <br><br><h4>  <font color="#78a2b7">It is generally a miracle that she came out!</font> </h4><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7ea/061/12b/7ea06112b2ba13c1c98df59a7e06b0c9.jpg"></div><br>  Yes!  Then we went with her to <a href="https://kanobu.ru/pub/110001/">Penny Arcade Expo</a> .  Everyone thought that Duke Nukem will not work, because the studio was closed.  By the time the game has already become a legend, people have been talking about Duke Nukem for more than ten years.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We took a big stand and closed it with a black cloth so that no one could see anything in advance. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And as soon as the exhibition opened, we removed the fabric.</font></font><br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/12c/74b/f87/12c74bf875b55d29c2e5de21cfd6c0fe.jpg"></div><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There are videos on the Net, as people run into the exhibition, straight to the next game show, run past Duke Nukem, turn around, slip, double-roll back to return to Duke Nukem. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For 15 minutes, an eight-hour queue has assembled. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The game has become the number one topic on Twitter. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Trailer became the most popular gaming trailer for the year, ahead of Call of Duty. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Everyone was crazy with thoughts, what kind of hit they have prepared.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Everyone gladly tried our craft, and it tasted pretty good. It could be done cooler. Maybe it would be different if I were a publisher. This is all a matter of waiting. The game turned out the way it was supposed to be - popcorn shooter, bi action movie. But she was funny, crazy, funny, sometimes absurd. There is a moment where you fall off and run around the diner, jumping on french fries. The game is absolutely absurd. This is not the best game of all time, but it is fun.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If you expected it to be the best game of all time, you get a critical difference in expectations, think ‚Äúto hell!‚Äù And your personal assessment of the game becomes lower than fair. My situation is reversed, as we remember, my expectations were low. What had to be done was not to sell this game as AAA for the full price. It had to be sold in a brown cardboard box and called Duke Nukem Forever: Bootleg Edition. She was not supposed to exist. After closing 3D Realms, the game consisted of individual pieces that the team collected and stitched together.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It was worth selling bucks for 20. And writing something like ‚ÄúIt should not have existed. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But if you are interested in how the last 15 years have passed, then hold on. ‚Äù </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Then the initial expectations would be completely different, and we would have a better chance of success. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I think if today people come back and look at the game, given the realities of the market and what the team went through ... Duke Nukem will look charming.</font></font><br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img

Nukem fueled great expectations. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">10 years, George and Scott told everyone that this would be the best game of all. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">When you say that, and then you don‚Äôt, that‚Äôs all, the end. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">You're in deep trouble. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But the game had to come out necessarily under the contract, it came out, and now we can do something further.</font></font><br><br><h4> <font color="#78a2b7"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font

cost five dollars. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">She's funny, I'm sure you will have fun. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">You will remember how you had fun in this game,

<font color="#78a2b7"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I am interested in this. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I haven't worked in the gaming industry for more than 10 years, and you are the CEO of Gearbox's big studio. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">During the ten years that I retired, I managed to play around with Unreal and Unity. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Tools for creating games during this time greatly developed. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Anyone can make games, and there are a lot of indie developers like that. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">How do you feel about this, is it good or bad in your opinion?</font></font></font> </h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I think it's great! </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I remember - and you remember - when everything was just beginning, it was available to very few people. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">You had to have access to the technology, to the tools, or to create the necessary tools yourself. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Today, computers are available to everyone, because everyone has a telephone.</font></font><br><br><h4> <font color="#78a2b7"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And the Internet is.</font></font></font> </h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Yes, everyone has a telephone and Internet access. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And that means you have access to everything. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We live at a time when all the information is available, you can find it and use it for your work. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">You can study on your own. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Therefore, we now have more game developers than ever. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In game development, interaction is very important, so this situation is only for the better.</font></font><br><br><h4> <font color="#78a2b7"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Agree with you. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There are more bad games, but at the same time more good ones.</font></font></font> </h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">You can't do something good until you have tried it many times. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Many start, do some shit, understand why it happened, do it again, repeat, repeat and finally come to the fact: oh, I'm already good at it! </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Here we need practice, we need to repeat.</font></font><br><br><h4> <font color="#78a2b7"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Another question about the gaming industry. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I left there because I was already old.</font></font></font> </h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> This is not a problem at all. </font></font><br><br><h4> <font color="#78a2b7"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Yes, I know, I left AAA tiles and now I love casual games. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In general, the games have become so complicated, so you work on Borderlands 3 ...</font></font></font> </h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The way it is. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The team Borderlands 300-400 people. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">(Yes, this is a lot) This is really a lot! </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Do you remember how we all could stay in one room?</font></font><br><br><h4> <font color="#78a2b7"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">8 people, 8 people.</font></font></font> </h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Yes, now a lot of time is spent on the organization, but do you know what? Thanks to this, specialization is now developing. One person can focus on one thing and do it very well, because he doesn't need to worry about everything else. The main thing here is to know that everyone is doing his own business, so that we can put everything together and take a step forward. This is very cool, this is just what I like today.</font></font><br><br><h4> <font color="#78a2b7">  . . ,        .      .   .       .      .     ,   .   ,   ,    ,  .     ,   -      .</font> </h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Yes, the whole level design has changed since we started. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But level designers still exist, and some of them are involved in level geometry. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">They bring together what others are doing and are more concerned with designing the gameplay, the gaming space. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Now we divide the creation of the game world into two parts - this is the design of the game level and the environment. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And the design of the game level is divided further - the creation of architecture and scripts. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And the environmental specialists put all the pieces together, from the elements. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Everything is constantly divided by specialization.</font></font><br><br><h4> <font color="#78a2b7"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I still think that in this state of affairs I would not be happy.</font></font></font> </h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Hah, Richard, you unhappy man! </font></font><br><br><h4> <font color="#78a2b7"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Yes, and my vanity is too great, I do not like to share toys.</font></font></font> </h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Actually, I understand you. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">When we made the first game in Gearbox - it was Half Life: Opposing Force - as I said, there were only 12 of us. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And I had to do a lot, I actively invested in the game, because I had no choice. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Now I am only one of the 400 participants in the project.</font></font><br><br><h4> <font color="#78a2b7"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">400 people ...</font></font></font> </h4><br>  Yes.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And even though I bear the greatest responsibility, my role is one four hundredth. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This is the work of the team. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Everything we do is a common result. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I made some contributions entirely by myself - I drew a logo, came up with a name. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">These are little things that everyone knows about.</font></font><br><br><h4> <font color="#78a2b7"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Yes, it turned out great.</font></font></font> </h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But most of my work is behind the scenes, it is not easy. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For example, when it comes to design principles or a game design system that extends beyond the same level. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I don‚Äôt decide, for example, whether to put this door here - I don‚Äôt remember when I last put the doors on levels. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I operate with larger entities and systems that must exist together.</font></font><br><br><h4> <font color="#78a2b7"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">As a designer.</font></font></font> </h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Yes.

Three people worked on it. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Three persons! </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The game is great! </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I played it and thought: God, that‚Äôs what the Borderlands would look like if we had ...</font></font><br><br><h4> <font color="#78a2b7"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Three‚Ä¶</font></font></font> </h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">No, if we had 20 people. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Those three did so well. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Great thing, play, very fun.</font></font><br><br><h4> <font color="#78a2b7"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Yeah, she's on Steam, and I already have the key.</font></font></font> </h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Yes, you know who to contact. </font></font><br><br><h4> <font color="#78a2b7"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Last question. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">He is connected with the rest. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">When we last worked together, it was 25 years ago. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I'm still a level designer ...</font></font></font> </h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Are you sure that 25 years old? </font></font><br><br><h4> <font color="#78a2b7"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Yes, exactly, three years ago!</font></font></font> </h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Let's go back for 25 years. </font></font><br><br><h4> <font color="#78a2b7"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Let's go back to 25, when you were still a boy, and I am a respected developer. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">You started as a level designer.</font></font></font> </h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Well, at first I was a programmer. </font></font><br><br><h4> <font color="#78a2b7"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Yes, you were a programmer before you came to 3D Realms to work on Duke Nukem. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There you were a level designer - this is a very creative job. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And now you are the CEO of a company of 400 people. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I do not think that this is a creative work - it is more focused on business, on management.</font></font></font> </h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> This is the other side of creativity. </font></font><br><br><h4> <font color="#78a2b7"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">She is creative, but in a different way. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">How do you combine everything together? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Do you miss those days?</font></font></font> </h4><br>  I will be honest: I'm not the CEO.  Technically, I'm not a CEO, we don't have a CEO.  I just do not argue with people when they call me the CEO, I do not want to interrupt the conversation.  I started a company, I own it, and that makes me someone. <br><br>  In fact, I feel happy when I create something.  I have two offices - an administrative office and a development office.  My participation depends on the stage of the project.  At an early stage, I immerse myself deeply in the project in order to clearly understand what we are doing.  But in what we do, I'm not the best anymore.  There are people who create art levels much better than me. <br><br><h4>  <font color="#78a2b7">Yes, they are younger, faster ...</font> </h4><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1ca/9e8/afb/1ca9e8afbc61121e1e1ce72e6dcc8c8f.jpg"></div><br>  Here it‚Äôs not even about age, but about specialization.  I need to focus on different things, control everything at a much higher level, so I‚Äôm not so good at the levels below.  Not like I did it every day.  And I think that if I did this every day, I would be able to maintain my skills.  If you do something, your skill grows in it.  In my case, this is always a compromise. <br><br>  One of the coolest things that appeared in Gearbox from the very beginning is that the reward system, the distribution of profits does not depend on your position in the company, but on the time you spend on the project.  The producer receives the same portion of the profits per day as the level designer.  This is cool. <br><br><h4>  <font color="#78a2b7">Yes, it's great, it unites.</font> </h4><br>  Thanks to this, we can work where we are most effective.  We do not think where exactly we will earn more money - everyone will receive the same.  There are no compromises here. <br><br><h4>  <font color="#78a2b7">Let's remember Duke Nukem: 20th Anniversary Edition.</font>  <font color="#78a2b7">For me, this was the first project since I retired from Ritual Entertainment, which is no longer there.</font> </h4><br>  I pulled you back! <br><br><h4>  <font color="#78a2b7">It was so fun working with Allen ...</font> </h4><br>  And what you did is one of your best work! <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/dbd/379/dcc/dbd379dcce72a52d3f738654e14e9699.jpg"></div><br><h4>  <font color="#78a2b7">Allen with Randy Pitchford, Doug Wood &amp; Dirk Jones.</font> <font color="#78a2b7"><br><br></font>  <font color="#78a2b7">Yes, here Allen distinguished himself, I always liked how he works.</font>  <font color="#78a2b7">With Ritual, we received more money from games than we invested in them, but I never received a check depending on royalties.</font> </h4><br>  Oh, I'm glad you still got it! <br><br><h4>  <font color="#78a2b7">We received money there, here, most of the money went back to the company.</font>  <font color="#78a2b7">And then I received the first royalty-check ... it seems, for $ 250,000. I received it in Moscow from you from Texas via mail.</font>  <font color="#78a2b7">I look and think ... what is it?</font>  <font color="#78a2b7">My God, this is a check from royalty!</font> </h4><br>  Yes, you can earn thanks to your creativity, why not? <br><br><h4>  <font color="#78a2b7">I printed it and hung it on the wall.</font>  <font color="#78a2b7">It was nice!</font> </h4><br>  Yes, I was also glad when our financiers said: ‚ÄúOh, we paid off.  This game makes money. ‚Äù  This is a great feeling. <br><br><h4>  <font color="#78a2b7">Let's do more.</font> </h4><br>  Yes, let's do more.  In Duke Nukem 3D six episodes, you can think of something else. <br><br><h4>  <font color="#78a2b7">Of course.</font>  <font color="#78a2b7">The world needs more.</font> </h4><br>  And thanks for taking the level in London!  I started drawing this map but I realized that I didn‚Äôt have enough time for that. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/88d/007/c29/88d007c29bdc23bc1642cb8fab9e6823.jpg"></div><br><h4>  <font color="#78a2b7">I put it all together, and at this level I got two puzzles.</font>  <font color="#78a2b7">And then your Q &amp; A guys said they are too complicated.</font> </h4><br>  Yes, that's my problem!  I always do the most difficult puzzles. <br><br><h4>  <font color="#78a2b7">Level designers love this.</font> </h4><br>  And people themselves are like their puzzles. <br><br><h4>  <font color="#78a2b7">And I love it when the fun starts right away, I'm here to shoot.</font> </h4><br>  I remember the puzzle that I put on the first level of the Shadow Warrior.  Everyone said that I was crazy and nobody would pass the first level.  That's my problem ... <br><br><h4>  <font color="#78a2b7">I do not like puzzles, I like to shoot.</font> </h4><br>  I perceive everything as Tetris, my brain collects everything as a puzzle. <br><br><h4>  <font color="#78a2b7">Great game.</font>  <font color="#78a2b7">She came up with in Russia.</font>  <font color="#78a2b7">I don‚Äôt know if he is here or in America ...

I have such a way of thinking. <br><br><h4>  <font color="#78a2b7">Tetris is one of my favorite computer games.</font>  <font color="#78a2b7">Together with Colossal Cave.</font> </h4><br>  So great to be with you here.  I still can not believe that you are in Moscow. <br><br><h4>  <font color="#78a2b7">Yes, I still can not believe that I am in Moscow.</font>  <font color="#78a2b7">I walk, look around and think: well, the Kremlin, St. Basil's Cathedral ... okay, I'm here, I'm here.</font> </h4><br>  This is my first time in Moscow, and it's nice here.  Thank you for telling me something and spending time with me.  I want to come back again and come back.  Let's meet again. <br><br><h4>  <font color="#78a2b7">Yes of course.</font>  <font color="#78a2b7">Super.</font> </h4><br>  See you later. <br><br><h4>  <font color="#78a2b7">Since we're here, I want to ask you.</font>  <font color="#78a2b7">I used to have some idea of ‚Äã‚ÄãRussia.</font>  <font color="#78a2b7">I came here in some fright, not knowing what to expect.</font>  <font color="#78a2b7">And the point is not propaganda, but the fact that we simply do not have enough information.</font>  <font color="#78a2b7">But I, and another 30-40 of my friends come here and say: Russia is a great place, people are excellent, cities are fantastic.</font>  <font color="#78a2b7">What do you feel before leaving home?</font> </h4><br>  I really like.  The more I travel the world, the more I understand: all people are the same everywhere.  We want to be loved, we want to have fun, rejoice, be happy.  The more I understand this, the more I think politics and all this crap don't matter.  People are important, and we all want the same thing.  Have a good time and be loved. <br><br><h4>  <font color="#78a2b7">Have a roof over your head, food, start a family ...</font> </h4><br>  We want to feel in comfort and safety, have fun.  And I am pleased that the creation of entertainment has become my job.  This industry creates joy and happiness. <br><br><h4>  <font color="#78a2b7">And connects the world.</font> </h4><br>  Yes, I felt it perfectly on DevGAMM when I saw all these young independent gaming developers.  They are the same as me, and it does not matter that we speak different languages.  I - they are in 20 years.  They are me 20 years ago.  This is a wonderful feeling, and I'm already waiting for the moment when I return. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/909/f69/ae5/909f69ae5ce6345346cd645683940f18.jpg"></div><br><h4>  <font color="#78a2b7">Yes, we will definitely call you again.</font> </h4><br><a name="6"></a><h2>  <font color="#3AC1EF">Why quit college and how to do chic settings.</font>  <font color="#3AC1EF">Christy Pitchford and Nikolai</font> </h2><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d1e/5a8/6e4/d1e5a86e41f521a671325ac46cda633e.jpg"></div><br><h4>  <font color="#78a2b7">We are delighted to welcome Christie Pitchford.</font>  <font color="#78a2b7">Christie is CEO of Nerdvana Game Studios, Nerdvana Spirits Bar and Nerdvana Coffee Shop.</font>  <font color="#78a2b7">As many as three companies.</font> </h4><br>  Hey.  Thanks for calling! <br><br><h4>  <font color="#78a2b7">Christie, on your twitter I read that in 29 years of your life with Randy, he never drank coffee or alcohol.</font>  <font color="#78a2b7">Although you have your own bar and coffee shop.</font>  <font color="#78a2b7">This shows great mutual respect.</font>  <font color="#78a2b7">But sometimes ... I know that you are doing a number of projects together, and you are working together.</font>  <font color="#78a2b7">Maybe sometimes you have conflicts, there are even disputes, your interests overlap.</font>  <font color="#78a2b7">If this happens, what do you do to make a decision?</font> </h4><br>  I think where we intersect ... he does not drink coffee and alcohol, I like both, but he does not care.  He likes what I do, board and video games are closely related.  But when we have disputes ... I can't even call it disputes.  We have different management styles.  I am very attached to my employees.  He, too, is close to them, but for Randy this is less of a friendship than for me.  I do not think that we are arguing - we simply complement a friend, including in the style of company management. <br><br>  It is more difficult to travel.  We both travel a lot.  We can not see for a long time.  He does not tell me that he is going somewhere, but I have joint plans, but he did not know ... this is possible here.  But we have an assistant who tries to match our calendars so that we know where everyone is and our plans do not overlap.  In general, we do not argue.  We do not argue often. <br><br><h4>  <font color="#78a2b7">I know that your latest project in my game studio is a board game in the Borderlands universe.</font>  <font color="#78a2b7">Can you tell me her story?</font>  <font color="#78a2b7">I know people love board games, including in Russia.</font>  <font color="#78a2b7">But why now?</font>  <font color="#78a2b7">As far as I noticed, at least in Russia, the boom of board games passed 5-10 years ago.</font>  <font color="#78a2b7">Why did you come to this now?</font>  <font color="#78a2b7">That was the plan?</font>  <font color="#78a2b7">Tell us about it.</font> </h4><br>  I think it was a natural development.  Randy has his own game development, there are board games in my bar and coffee shop.  And I have a team that is having fun with board games.  Together we play a bunch of games. <br><br>  We have a great opportunity to work with the Borderlands franchise.  My own office is inside the Gearbox office.  I can easily consult with artists, screenwriters, I make a single picture out of it.  I am in the best position to give Borderlands life in board games.  In general, working with someone else's intellectual property is a struggle.  And I myself worked on the first part, and on the second, and in general a sick fan of the series.  For me, this project has become a natural development.  And again, my own team loves board games.  So it all came together. <br><br><h4>  <font color="#78a2b7">What genre did you make the game?</font>  <font color="#78a2b7">What does she look like?</font> </h4><br>  We made this game very quickly, because we wanted it to be released on the day of the announcement of Borderlands 3. I needed to make it all in four months.  We worked with a company in Chicago that makes this funny game about robots [it‚Äôs about XYZ Games and RobotLabs - approx.  trans.].  We took this game, changed it and turned it into a Borderlands card game, where you build different Claptraps - Kleptrap-gentleman, Kleptrap-pyroman.  And you must prevent others from building their Claptraps.  You give your opponents details that they don‚Äôt need, and you get the ones you need ... it's a pretty casual card game with beautiful artifacts from Borderlands.  She can learn very quickly - we did it so that the gameplay was very dynamic. <br><br><h4>  <font color="#78a2b7">Starting with Claptrap is a great idea.</font>  <font color="#78a2b7">Everyone loves Claptrap.</font> </h4><br>  Yes, and this game Tiny Tiny, which everyone also loves, like Claptrap. <br><br><h4>  <font color="#78a2b7">Is it a set of cards in a small box?</font> </h4><br>  Yes, this is a small box with ordinary cards, action cards, robots - this is such a game. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e46/af3/16f/e46af316f834c06bb9b605e01a2902b0.jpg"></div><br><h4>  <font color="#78a2b7">Any plans for future games in the Borderlands universe?</font> </h4><br>  Yes of course. <br><br><h4>  <font color="#78a2b7">Can you give me some teaser?</font> </h4><br>  No, I can't say anything, but we really enjoy working in this setting and bringing Borderlands to board games.  This is my favorite intellectual property, I know this universe well, and we have plans for the future. <br><br><h4>  <font color="#78a2b7">Perfectly!</font>  <font color="#78a2b7">Let's go back to the times when you were just starting the Borderlands universe.</font>  <font color="#78a2b7">Randy said it all started in a mix of RPG and shooter.</font>  <font color="#78a2b7">But we also love Borderlands for the setting, a post-apocalyptic, crazy universe.</font>  <font color="#78a2b7">I know that basically you did it.</font>  <font color="#78a2b7">Can you tell us any secrets of a cool setting?</font> </h4><br>  You know, this is such a big collaboration between different people.  I was in charge of the dialogue.  In the original Borderlands, I wrote replicas of Patricia Tannis and other characters.  My work was not the most exciting.  You have an NPC, he gives you a direction, tells you what to do.  But if you come back and do not complete the quest, the NPC asks, ‚ÄúDid you do it?  You did it?".  But you do not want him to denounce this idea the same way every time, so I wrote a table where there were four variants of this replica.  "You did it?  How is it?  Did you do it?  It turned out? "And at the same time it is necessary that all the replicas correspond to the character of the character.  This is a rather tedious part, but it is necessary that the player does not get bored by repeating the same actions. <br><br>  I must be able to get used to each character in order to understand how he speaks.  Will he be impatient, will he become frantic, will he be frivolous ... this is necessary to create individuality through dialogues.  It's very funny. <br><br><h4>  <font color="#78a2b7">You have to get used to each character's head, to say the same thing forty to fifty times in different words on his behalf.</font>  <font color="#78a2b7">Crazy experience!</font>  <font color="#78a2b7">You need to live right in the universe of Borderlands.</font> </h4><br>  Yes! <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6ef/511/84d/6ef51184d1ff6196bc1a6caedf24e89c.jpg"></div><br><h4>  <font color="#78a2b7">And what do you say about the creation of sequels?</font>  <font color="#78a2b7">You made the first Borderlands, character set, cool world.</font>  <font color="#78a2b7">What about Borderlands 2 and 3?</font>  <font color="#78a2b7">How to make people want to return to the game world?</font> </h4><br>  I think the beauty of Borderlands is that everyone can find themselves in one character or another.  They are all very different.  I believe, instead of having a limited set of similar characters, Borderlands offers truly unique characters.  This is very attractive to players, they want to go back to each character, learn more about it.  This is what makes Borderlands replayable - a large number of dynamic characters.  Even more such incredible characters are added to the DLC - Moxy, Mr. Torrg.  These characters were not in the original game, but they became the hallmark of Borderlands. <br><br><h4>  <font color="#78a2b7">That is, in each new part of the game you integrate new characters, new stories.</font>  <font color="#78a2b7">You have no problems with the docking of the characters, placing them inside the world, where their connections and rules have already been established?</font>  <font color="#78a2b7">How do you place each new character in such a way that it looks organically, as if it were always in the game?</font> </h4><br>  These gearbox writers are more experienced writers.  But I think, due to the fact that the whole world is so crazy, you can be bolder and more unusual in introducing new characters.  No need to strictly adhere to any rules.  You can add road with cars in the middle of the desert, all sorts of crazy things (like Earl).  No need to follow the exact rules, this is Borderlands, everything is strange here.  This planet comes from everywhere, which gives us a crazy world in which there is a sense. <br><br><h4>  <font color="#78a2b7">There are no rules in Borderlands, there is only style, yes?</font> </h4><br>  No, it has its own rules, but Borderlands does not play by the rules. <br><br><h4>  <font color="#78a2b7">There are rules in Borderlands, but they are not strict, you can break them.</font> </h4><br>  Yes, you can deal with them more freely, this is the style of the game. <br><br><h4>  <font color="#78a2b7">Okay, the games are cool, but let's go back to the times when you first met Randy.</font>  <font color="#78a2b7">You also studied as a lawyer ...</font> </h4><br>  No, did not study. <br><br><h4>  <font color="#78a2b7">You were not going to be a lawyer.</font>  <font color="#78a2b7">Where did you study?</font> </h4><br>  I was in college, but Randy met back in school.  And he just graduated.  I got a job at an ice cream shop on the beach, and he was already working there.  We became friends, started dating.  He went to study in Los Angeles, and I went to Santa Barbara.  Between them 90 minutes drive.  We were together, we went to different colleges.  When he received an invitation to 3D Realms in 1996, he was still studying.  In the video game industry then it was very difficult to get through, we decided that this was our chance, we dropped out of colleges and left for Texas.  That's how it was.  And now, after more than 20 years, we are sitting here ... <br><br><h4>  <font color="#78a2b7">And it's cool!</font> </h4><br>  Yes, everything goes like clockwork. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/eec/64c/a03/eec64ca038dfe543c5bb64f0d3e29c57.jpg"></div><br><h4>  <font color="#78a2b7">I heard that you played a big part in getting Randy to leave the legal profession and start doing what he really likes.</font>  <font color="#78a2b7">What was the story here?</font>  <font color="#78a2b7">Was there a moment when he clearly decided to change everything?</font> </h4><br>  I think we are both not looking for proven paths.  We love to risk.  There was a big risk of dropping out of college, leaving many states away from home, not knowing exactly what lies ahead.  But we both love adventure, it captures us.  And I think Randy would not be happy being a lawyer.  It did not suit him.  He was already engaged in magic, tricks most of the time, programmed, worked in the editors of Doom and Duke Nukem.  He did this all the time, so it simply didn‚Äôt make sense to ignore that passion and study for a lawyer.  We then only recently turned 20 - it's time to risk in life, as long as there are no children and a lot of responsibility.  I think we both wanted to start the adventure and get off the safe path. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/194/ff2/fe1/194ff2fe1b6014c857762d6b4bfe6cd9.jpg"></div><br><h4>  <font color="#78a2b7">It's great.</font>  <font color="#78a2b7">Today, many are arguing about education, university education in Russia.</font>  <font color="#78a2b7">For example, some sites with vacancies exclude education from user profiles, leaving only lists of skills.</font>  <font color="#78a2b7">Do you think that classical education will cease to be necessary?</font>  <font color="#78a2b7">Maybe people just need to look for themselves?</font> </h4><br>  Well I do not know.  I returned to college and graduated five years ago, received a degree in psychology.  And this after 14 years!  I like to go to school, get an education.  But this did not allow me to achieve what I achieved.  But it helped me focus, I got an incredible experience.  It seems to me that there is no right way here, everyone must choose for himself.  For those who do not know what to stop at, college is perfect - you can visit different subjects and understand what you need.  But if you already know the direction, and you do not need a formal education, all that remains is to gain experience.  Especially if we talk about art and entertainment, where the portfolio is much more important than education. <br><br>  The first time in college I did not like.  I was too young and did not understand what I was doing.  But when I returned, I liked it.  So I do not know. <br><br><h4>  <font color="#78a2b7">Wow</font>  <font color="#78a2b7">Back to college after building a career in another field ... Are you still in college?</font> </h4><br>  No, I finished five years ago. <br><br><h4>  <font color="#78a2b7">Oh, right, you already finished.</font>  <font color="#78a2b7">Does it help you in your work?</font> </h4><br>  Yes, I have a degree in psychology, and I think psychology is useful in any interaction with people.  You can better understand people's motives, and I find this very useful.  I have about 48 employees, and psychology helps me a lot.  I interact with everyone, from dishwashers to managers, and my psychology degree helps a lot.  And also, of course, in communicating with customers.  So for me it was great.  If I came back and got a degree, for example, in history, it would not be so useful, but a degree in psychology would be useful to me everywhere. <br><br>  And Randy is also helped, in decisions regarding the games of the company.  I came home, told him about what I had learned, and it perfectly intersected with his work. <br><br><h4>  <font color="#78a2b7">You share your experience and knowledge.</font> </h4><br>  Yes. <br><br><h4>  <font color="#78a2b7">It's great.</font> </h4><br><a name="7"></a><h2>  <font color="#3AC1EF">The most important advice.</font>  <font color="#3AC1EF">Randy and Nikolai</font> </h2><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/db4/273/6bc/db42736bc82ddcb416ed5ab5248831dc.jpg"></div><br><h4>  <font color="#78a2b7">Randy, I know that you have a computer in the late 70s - early 80s.</font>  <font color="#78a2b7">And then you were still a child.</font>  <font color="#78a2b7">How could this happen then?</font> </h4><br>  Well, my father was like me.  He was nerd.  He worked for military intelligence, made computers and communications equipment ‚Äî probably to spy on you guys. <br><br><h4>  <font color="#78a2b7">The Cold War and its tricks.</font> </h4><br>  Yes, and we had computers all over the houses, just like when you were growing up.  Technology has always been a part of my life. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/aef/cf0/009/aefcf000980c3aa25fb3f1bfe35769d3.jpg"></div><br><h4>  <font color="#78a2b7">Can you describe your first computer?</font>  <font color="#78a2b7">He probably occupied the whole room, the garage?</font>  <font color="#78a2b7">How big was he?</font> </h4><br>  In fact, I remember the computer that my father made in Xerox - it was <a href="http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/sds/sigma/sigma7/900950J_Sigma7_RefMan_Oct73.pdf">Sigma 7</a> .  It was a huge mainframe.  But the first computer he gave me was based on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zilog_Z80">Z80 processor</a> and was quite compact.  It was one of the first home computers. <br><br><h4>  <font color="#78a2b7">And what could he do?</font> </h4><br>  He had only 2 kilobytes of RAM - this is a bit.  I could program on BASIC.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> My computer was not bad, he could do more than it seems, but I always lacked memory. </font></font><br><br><h4> <font color="#78a2b7"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Randy, what's next?
