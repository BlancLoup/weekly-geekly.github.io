Employees have a wide choice, and companies and start-ups often aggressively fight for the same candidates.  For early-stage companies to succeed, their founders must create an effective recruiting process - and the sooner the better. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  From this will depend on the face of the company, its philosophy and the future of a startup.  Dan Portillo of Greylock Partners (one of the leading venture capital firms in Silicon Valley), who recruited companies such as US Digital Service, Rypple and Mozilla, said that he had to watch more than once The process of hiring employees had a strong influence on the evolution of the organization. <br><br>  Portillo is of the opinion that the most important thing in the reception of employees from what an entrepreneur can do is to find and hire a first-class recruiter.  When companies are in the early stages of their development, the founders are inclined to take to the headquarters of those people with whom they worked before, were familiar, went to school, were in the same environment.  But with the growth of the company, you need to look for people who are able to jump above their heads, and to draw attention to companies with a well-established brand and product that is not yet fully developed.  Moreover, startups do not have to hope that the project will be able to attract employees with an excellent reputation established over the decades or high wages.  Young firms need to try to focus the attention of candidates on the prospects of the company and an excellent team.

      According to Portillo, startups need to abandon the standard job descriptions, adopting a more dynamic approach to the issue.  Startups should look for potential candidates, study what kind of people they are interested in, and see if this is consonant with the company's mission. <br><br>  Growing companies constantly have new vacancies and change teams.  They change and evolve with the company to fit it.  Founders should pay special attention to ensuring that potential candidates fit the corporate culture of the company and meet its goals and missions. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/297216/">https://habr.com/ru/post/297216/</a></p>
