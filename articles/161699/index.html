  <section class="page js-page"><h1>A new vector in the development of the system - a stable version of ImageCMS 4.0</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/169/551/9ec/1695519ecdc484f4d9ffdece18279494.jpg"><br>  Over the past four weeks, we have subjected ImageCMS 4.0b to extensive testing in order to eliminate all existing bugs in the stable version (corrected in four approaches) and shortcomings.  All departments of the company, our community, Clients, bug tracker were connected to the error detection process.  Such a tense, but, hopefully, fruitful teamwork allowed us today to announce the full launch of a stable <a href="http://www.imagecms.net/">ImageCMS 4.0.</a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  In addition to fixing bugs, we also worked out a few open questions about modules: </h4><br>  <b>- User data management</b> .  We have combined data on users of the basic version and the Shop module in a single table.  The solution was implemented only now, although the idea appeared a long time ago.  The previous approach made development difficult, forcing to constantly monitor the relevance of user data in the Shop module when updating or inserting data, and there was a risk of data loss due to difficulties in synchronizing it with the module table.  All these problems are already in the past - the information is now always at hand, and the possibilities are open for writing a standardized API for access to it from the side of the modules. <br><br>  <b>- Filter goods</b> .  Fully reworked filter mechanism and category controller.  The new filter works about 4 times faster, it is also more resistant to high loads.  All database queries are implemented through the net without using Propel, which gave a significant performance boost. <br><br>  <b>- Improved SEO support.</b>  Regarding this aspect, the system has changed to the following: <br><ul><li>  There is an opportunity for flexible management of the process of creating templates for meta title; </li><li>  updated social buttons module - now they have become even more.  User activity on the site is monitored using Yandex. Metrics; </li><li>  it is possible to set the URL for the product card in CNC format.  Now the product name will be displayed by transliteration instead of ID. </li></ul>  All changes will positively affect the results of the store promotion.

      <br>
      <b>- Changed the system to work additional fields for the basic version, and for the module Shop.</b>  Now it is possible to add the same property to several groups ( <a href="http://idea.imagecms.net/topic/130328-vozmozhnost-odno-i-to-zhe-dopolnitelnoe-pole-ispolzvat-v-neskolkih-gruppah-polej/">http: //idea.imagecms.net/topic/130328 ...</a> ) In addition, we enabled the default WYSIWYG editor for the ‚Äútextarea‚Äù type field and added the ability to upload documents to online store properties.  The latter function is very convenient to use when loading documentation or certificates to the goods. <br><br>  <b>- Import-export system.</b>  In this version, we refined the export of goods in accordance with the available fields.  Property fields for import and export have also been added.  Improved scheme parser robots increased the fault tolerance and speed of the script. <br><br><h4>  Edits touched on other aspects of the system: </h4><br><ul><li>  <b>E-mail alert.</b>  The logic of a single entry point has been added: now all letters are sent using the work of one module and the transmitted data.  The function is convenient for setting up an e-mail alert system, for example, when setting up work via a specific protocol. </li><li>  <b>Properties of the goods.</b>  Fixed the conclusion regarding the position, other minor bugs. </li><li>  <b>Discounts.</b>  The logic of the work of discounts by user groups, product categories, temporary discount, taking into account the range of reality, has been reworked. </li><li>  <b>Recalculate the amount of goods.</b>  The ability to indicate the need for decrementing the amount of goods available in stock after payment of the order. </li></ul><br>  Especially for our developers, we have created a kind of assistant - a system of behavior.  The goal is to provide the ability to quickly respond to events that occurred during the operation of the system.  On the appearance of each new comment, order or payment confirmation, you can run your own events in response.  For example, you can now send an e-mail alert about the appearance of a new comment in the desired format, without going beyond the scope of its module.  In addition, if you are the developer of the module for ImageCMS, from now on you have the opportunity to provide your colleagues with the same original API, giving them the opportunity to also respond to everything that happens during the operation of the system.  More details about this feature we will post in the following posts. <br><br>  And, of course, on the eve of the New Year holidays, following the best world traditions, we let go of everything old, and let in the life of the company fresh and new.  In parallel with the release of the system, we present you the updated <a href="http://www.imagecms.net/">official website of the system</a> .  We hope he will continue to contribute to our users, community members and partners in their work!  Updating the documentation of the ImageCMS system on the official <a href="http://wiki.imagecms.net/%25D0%2597%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D1%2586%25D0%25B0">Wiki</a> site will also be a good addition to the transformed site. <br><br>  We are already starting to fulfill all your wishes related to the improvement of ImageCMS.  In the next version, wait for even more improvements for the most flexible and convenient system operation. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/161699/">https://habr.com/ru/post/161699/</a></p>
