      Take, for example, <b>Bill Gates</b> .  Many people dislike it because of untold riches.  But do you think the main purpose of the formation of Microsoft was precisely enrichment?  Not.  Gates loved computers, and he liked to make things. <br><br>  Another good example is <b>Steve Jobs</b> .  He became incredibly wealthy and famous for the founding of Apple, but he never sought wealth.  His goal was to produce world-class goods.  First came the love of design, and then came the money and fame. <br><br>  Of course, there are people who are not interested in anything but money.  For example, managers with WallStreet.  But people of this type as a result may be poorer than all of us. <br><br>  Today, you will learn about a few bright signs of success that have nothing to do with money or fame. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">You are free</font> </h2><br>  Success comes when you are free from a life in which you have to please everyone around.  Success arises when you are freed from the need to listen to external noise and can <a href="http://testutor.ru/blog/kak-nauchitsya-sebya-kontrolirovat-i-nachat-zhit-toj-zhiznyu-o-kotoroj-vy-mechtaete/">concentrate on what is important to you</a> .  Success comes when you move away from thinking that reality is very far from your desires. <br><br>  Become free from the perception of the world through the prism of prejudice learned in the process of growing up.  Free yourself from the need to be "realist."  Get away from worry and start living. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">You take on projects with unpredictable results.</font> </h2><br>  All the most prosperous people in the world were forced to experiment, not knowing what the consequences would be.  Even if the attempt fails, you will receive a valuable lesson: the world has not collapsed.  You can try again and again. <br><br>  Successes and failures are intertwined.  Take anyone who has succeeded, and you will find a whole <a href="http://testutor.ru/blog/pyat-sekretov-vospitaniya-sily-voli-ot-agenta-fbr/">string of failures in his path</a> . <br><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúIt doesn't matter how many times you fail, you only have to be right once‚Äù </blockquote><br>  - Mark Kuban <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">You are polite</font> </h2><br>  One of the most successful books on self-improvement of all times, ‚ÄúHow to win friends and influence people,‚Äù offers such simple tips for success: <br><ul><li>  smile; </li><li>  be polite; </li><li>  praise others for their good work; </li><li>  do not argue with others. </li></ul><br>  It's amazing how many people are unfamiliar with good manners.  Attitudes toward people produce immediate results.  Every person you meet is in his own eyes the most important person in the world. <br><br>  Successful people know about this, and they relate to others precisely from this position. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">You often forget about everything</font> </h2><br>  In a well-lived life many moments spent in a state of flow <sup><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Flow-Psychology-Experience-Perennial-Classics/dp/0061339202/ref%3Dsr_1_1%3Fie%3DUTF8%26qid%3D1456841774%26sr%3D8-1%26keywords%3Dflow">‚òÖ</a></sup> <br>  Such a deep immersion in work gives you a sense of satisfaction. <br><br>  Remember the moments when you lost the sense of time doing something - this is the flow. <br>  Your task is to find a job that will allow you to face such situations as often as possible.  The value of passion exceeds the value of money.  Look for a job that you can dive into completely. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">Someone thanked you for what you did.</font> </h2><br>  Has anyone ever wanted to thank you for your work?  This is a success. <br><br>  No matter how much you crave for success, you will never achieve it unless you find a way to benefit other people.  Your business is not focused on you, but on the consumer. <br><br>  Your creativity is not meant for you, it should cause a response from others.  Every time someone leaves a kind comment or sends a message with gratitude for the publication, the professional gets an incentive to continue working.  Gain success by giving something to others. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">You annoy someone</font> </h2><br>  Because you believe in something.  Because you have (reasonable!) An opinion with which others may disagree.  Because you have the courage to say what we all fearfully silent. <br><br>  Successful people do not seek to maintain the status quo.  Seeing that the system is not working, they are looking for ways to correct the situation and find like-minded people willing to help them. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">You do what inspires you</font> </h2><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúThe opposite of love is indifference, and the opposite of happiness is boredom‚Äù </blockquote><br>  - Tim Ferris, "4-hour work week" <br><br>  For most people, life is not so bad, but it is terribly boring.  That is why they constantly need entertainment TV shows. <br><br>  You are successful if you change the comfort for enthusiasm, work with a decent salary and compensation for vacation, a monotonous existence for a full vivid impression of life. <br><br>  Successful people collect memories, not bank notes. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">Your life meets your expectations.</font> </h2><br>  Here is a description of happiness in two words: the only thing you need to do to succeed is to live by your own standards.  Not by social norms.  Not according to the requirements of friends or relatives. <br><br>  Your dream should not be based on money or status.  All you need is the ability to do what brings you joy, and the opportunity to embark on all the interesting adventures. <br><br>  If you want to be a world-class chef, then be prepared to cook.  If you want to be a writer, create texts.  If your dream is to raise children, and you cope with it well, then you have succeeded. <br>  We all deserve full realization - a life that is more satisfying than provoking discontent. <br><br>  Money and position are great, but they usually serve as by-products of quality work on something important. <br><br>  Give your definition of success and do everything necessary to achieve it! <br><br>  PS We recommend another useful article on the work on oneself - the <a href="http://testutor.ru/blog/nauka-o-tom-kak-razvit-duxovnuyu-stojkost-v-rabote-i-v-zhizni/">science of how to develop spiritual endurance in work and in life</a> . <br><br>  The author of the translation is Vyacheslav Davidenko, the founder of the <a href="http://testutor.ru/">TESTutor</a> company. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/299938/">https://habr.com/ru/post/299938/</a></p>
