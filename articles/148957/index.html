      After 8 years, we will most likely use low-power processors, and all calculations will be performed in the clouds, in fully automated data centers with a flexible, scalable architecture. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/0c6/cce/ac8/0c6cceac84e5dbbef455bba6f89f4de1.jpg"><br>  <i>What form will cloud technologies take in 2020?</i> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The Forrester analyst group believes that the global cloud market will increase from $ 35bn (¬£ 22.5bn) in 2011 to $ 150bn in 2020, as clouds become a key part of the IT infrastructure of many enterprises. <br><br>  Along with the increase in demand from enterprises, there will surely be progress in technology that supports clouds, which is likely to make cloud technologies faster, more powerful and cheaper. <br><br>  And, of course, by 2020 there will be a change of generations of enterprise managers, and representatives of the new generation will undoubtedly pay more attention to the development and use of new cloud technologies. <br>  Given all the above trends, we present you 10 differences between future and modern cloud technologies. <br><br>  <b>1. Software floats away from hard drives</b> <br><br>  John Manley (John Manley), director of HP's Automated Infrastructure Lab, believes that the software will be removed from the equipment, more and more technologies will be used as-a-service.  ‚ÄúCloud computing is what makes computing completely invisible,‚Äù says Manly. <br><br>  As a result, in 2020, the IT director will not be able to draw a company's infrastructure map, says David Merrill, <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/hitachi-companies-have-horrible-storage-utilisation-3040155148/">chief economist at Hitachi Data Systems</a> .  He will be able to explain who his suppliers are, but he will not be able to depict an infrastructure diagram.  The reason for this situation will be the complexity of the scheme, according to which, before getting into the computer, the program will pass through several third-party filters.  This means that interface applications or applications based on a platform-like-service will be completely independent of the hardware. <br><br>  <b>2. Modular software</b> <br><br>  To use all the capabilities of cloud equipment, individual applications are configured to perform more complex and voluminous operations, as they are sharpened for scalability. <br>  As the size and complexity of individual programs grows, developers will pay more and more attention to modular software, whose components can be changed independently of others, without harming the entire program. <br><br>  As a result, cloud applications will require a new type of thinking in programming, especially when interacting with multiple systems. <br><br>  Manly also claims that managing the integrated services will be one of the main difficulties of 2020, since applications will not only be built in the cloud, but also use other cloud applications. <br><br>  In other words, the component parts of the application will ‚Äúfloat around‚Äù the core.  Providing the necessary level of application consistency will not be easy, says Manly. <br><br>  <b>3. Social software</b> <br><br>  In addition to modularity, software can get some of the features of modern social media applications, such as Facebook.  ‚ÄúThis will be the evolution of social media,‚Äù says Marill.  ‚ÄúThe infrastructure and software of the processing centers will form the necessary tasks.  Developers will no longer need to worry about servers and data storage, it will all happen automatically. ‚Äù <br><br>  <b>4. Equipment changes</b> <br><br>  By 2020, the transition to cost-effective equipment will be in full swing.  Most likely, many processes will be managed not only by Facebook and <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/aws-looks-set-for-massive-cloud-datacentre-expansion-but-where-7000001721/">AWS</a> , but also by other, smaller companies.  ‚ÄúServers and storage devices will look like small, easily replaceable parts,‚Äù says Frank Frankovsky, vice president of equipment design and supplies for Facebook, as well as chairman of the <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/facebook-opens-out-open-compute-project-3040094309/">Open Compute Project</a> . <br><br>  The separation of infrastructure into basic components, their replacement and upgrade can be made quickly.  The target audience of this service are large corporations that manage huge data flows.  ‚ÄúI would say that by 2020 the fastest-growing market for the cloud will be the technology market,‚Äù says Frankowski. <br><br>  <b>5. Low power processors and cheap clouds</b> <br><br>  It remains about a year before the introduction of <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/arm-you-think-our-servers-are-good-now-just-you-wait-7000001553/%3Fs_cid%3D458">low-power 64-bit ARM chips</a> , and as soon as they appear, a real revolution will occur, as companies will be able to use efficient processors in their data centers, which means they will reduce the cost of electricity by an order of magnitude. <br><br>  HP created a pilot Redstone platform within the <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/hps-project-moonshot-aims-for-power-thrifty-servers-3040094344/">Project Moonshot scheme</a> to try to offer ARM to its customers, while Dell has been selling ARM-based servers to a huge number of cloud clients for many years through Data Center Solutions. <br><br>  By 2020, low-power chips are likely to be everywhere.  And it will not be only ARM - Intel, fearing this threat, is actively working to develop a more economical chip that focuses more on mobile devices.  Facebook representatives believe that the introduction of ARM will begin in the field of equipment for storing information, and then spread to the servers. <br><br>  ‚ÄúI really think it will seriously affect the amount of‚Äú perfect work ‚Äùof every dollar,‚Äù says Frankowski.  This should help cloud providers, such as AWS, reduce their electricity bills.  Moreover, if they have to wage a price war with competitors, they will be able to lower prices a little bit at the expense of cheaper development. <br><br>  <b>6. Quick connect</b> <br><br>  The need for mass distribution of applications and the growth of the total number of high-performance processors will undoubtedly require a faster connection. <br>  Joseph Reger, CTO of Fujitsu Technology Solutions, predicts that by 2020 we can expect that the connection speed to data centers will be measured in hundreds of gigabytes per second. <br>  Reger says that he expects that there will be a rapid increase in the quality of Internet technologies, which will lead to a cheap and fast Internet connection.  This will allow much faster transfer of information between data centers at lower costs, allowing companies to create huge applications using much less powerful equipment. <br><br>  <b>7. Data centers will become ecosystems.</b> <br><br>  "Cloud data centers will look like living organisms," says Reger.  The processing centers should operate as a large ecosystem, effectively managing equipment using software with hardware control.  But at the same time, they should grow and shrink depending on the load. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/fe8/fd8/a48/fe8fd8a4804617339dde4b43696c0ef2.jpg"><br>  <i>‚ÄúCloud data centers will look like living organisms‚Äù, Photo: Jack Clark / ZDNet</i> <br><br>  ‚ÄúAutomating core tasks, such as repairing and updating equipment, will mean that processing centers will become similar to biological systems,‚Äù he says, drawing attention to the fact that changes and corrections will occur automatically. <br><br>  <b>8. Clouds merge</b> <br><br>  Due to the huge costs associated with the use of clouds, it is likely that there will be some kind of consolidation in the cloud technology market. <br><br>  Tough competition between several major suppliers may be good for society, as it will push them to develop new technologies and implement them as competitive advantages.  Google, for example, recently transferred its entire internal network to the new <a href="http://www.openflow.org/wp/learnmore/">OpenFlow standard</a> , which seems to shake up the entire market, because more and more people are accepting it. <br><br>  Manly claims that there will be a multitude of clouds targeting specific targets.  ‚ÄúThere will be diversification,‚Äù he says, ‚ÄúPerhaps everything will even end in monopolies if a product satisfies absolutely all non-functional [infrastructure requirements] of these complex services.‚Äù <br><br>  <b>9. Change of generations</b> <br><br>  By 2020, a new generation of managers will create new companies that will be actively involved in the ‚Äúcloud world‚Äù.  They will be well aware of the availability of all as-a-service, and will be much more active consumers than modern companies. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThis new generation could lead to a revolution in the entire IT business,‚Äù says Manly. <br><br>  1 <b>0. Clouds will accumulate</b> <br><br>  Today, the clouds differ in the services provided, it can be infrastructure, platform or software.  But by 2020, more likely, more specialized clouds will appear. <br><br>  According to Forrester, in 2020 we should expect things such as, for example, ‚Äúmedium virtualization tools‚Äù or ‚Äúdynamic BPO services‚Äù.  In other words, along with major providers offering technologies such as storage and computing, several more highly specialized ecosystems will emerge that will allow companies to send the most specific tasks to the clouds. <br><br>  Merrill says that clouds, like any utilities, will differ in infrastructure in a number of classes.  ‚ÄúClouds evolve like energy production, from coal to oil,‚Äù says Meryl. <br><br>  What do you think will be the ‚Äúcloud world‚Äù by 2020? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/148957/">https://habr.com/ru/post/148957/</a></p>
