There will be positive feedback - I will continue, there is something to continue. <br><br>  Once upon a time there was a young robot assembler Yin da Vyn. And she had seven robots, a little smaller, and the youngest was the smartest.  Every morning she was going to the assembly line, and severely punished in her absence no one could open the entrance hatch, and then trouble would happen.  And when I come, I will sing you a code song: <br>  - Robotushki guys, your mother came, brought electrodes! <br>  On the trouble lived next hacker.  The tricks are huge, the software package is the most advanced for three terabytes, and the neurodec is black and terrible!  He put the bug-wiretapping, but about those cherished words and found out. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  And only my mother started singing the Hymn of the Corporation - the hacker quickly ran to the robots, and let's connect the neurodec to the communication socket.  Joins, and he sings in a hacker voice: <br>  - Robot guys, your mother came, she brought electrodes! <br>  Robots heard that song, and how they would cry out: <br>  - Go away, not our mother you are!  Our mother has a thin neurodec, the Sony company, and your black and horrible one is immediately obvious - samopal! <br>  And the youngest blocked the opening servos. <br><br>  The hacker got angry terribly, let him go to the Master of Neural Interfaces.  Tells him: <br>  - Make me a thin deck, otherwise I will hack you and encrypt the key for 16384 bytes, the password will be sent via SMS after paying a fine! <br>  He was frightened by the Master of Neural Interfaces and made him a new neurodec - so thin that they didn‚Äôt see anyone in Sony.

      But only the robots immediately told their mother about the visit of the hacker.  My mother was frightened, and the children charged up and soiled, and then said: <br>  - I need to go again, but this time to the Director of the Corporation himself for a briefing with foreign partners.  And if anyone connects a black deck, and not singing in my voice - do not open it for anything! <br><br>  Hacker listens to all this on short waves, but know yourself is recording in hi-fi quality.  Hacker went to Chipodela, yes, and says: <br>  - Set your voice to me according to the attached sample, otherwise I will hack you and encrypt the key for 16384 bytes, the password will be sent via SMS after paying a fine! <br>  Frightened Chipodel, and set up. <br><br>  A hacker comes to the robots, gets a white neurodec, and sings in her mother's voice: <br>  - Robot guys, your mother came, she brought electrodes! <br>  Robotists thought that mother had returned, and that they had to turn on servos. <br><br>  The hatch opened wider than the mouth of the fan, who saw the idol, the hacker slipped into it, and attacked the robots.  They scattered all over the house, and everywhere he overtook them and dismantled them, only the youngest, the most intelligent, managed to get into the blackbox, so much so that he did not find him. <br><br>  Mom came home from work, and the access door was wide open, and throughout the house only the skeletons of robots remained in disrepair.  My mother sat down and burst into tears of burning tears ‚Äî gasoline and kerosene.  Yes, only the youngest robot kid got out of the blackbox is the smartest, and tell your mom what trouble it is. <br><br>  She then took a faithful laser soldering iron, and plastic brackets that were in use, and went into the darkest stone jungle.  He sees that the bar ‚ÄúAt the Forgotten Sysadmin‚Äù stands in the deafest alley, and under it lies an evil hacker, trained on the blue Nortons, and in his belly all the processors and the memory of the robot are built in, which is a serious upgrade! <br><br>  She grabbed a laser soldering iron, and dismantled the hacker, and then sealed the empty sockets with old plastic clips and made a radical modification of the behavioral settings.  At the same moment, the hacker was disappointed in the hacks and saw that the beauty was in front of him ... they mounted the public access interfaces and lived happily ever after, and the youngest robot, the smartest, often played with the newfound dad in the ‚ÄúMerry programmer‚Äù and the black mark of the unconditional transition ". <br><br>  And the fairy-tale is over, but whoever saintly holds the login, and his password is good. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/375269/">https://habr.com/ru/post/375269/</a></p>
