  <section class="page js-page"><h1>WebPagesThatSuck.com suckiness tests</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Some time ago, a terrible thing happened - my colleague and I talked about raising the structure of the new site for almost an hour with raised tones, how and where to place the menu.  We had diametrically opposed opinions, and no mention of beautiful words like ‚Äúusability‚Äù could reconcile us.  After our morale dried up, we decided to look for some practical information on usability.  So, I came across the <a href="http://www.webpagesthatsuck.com/">site of</a> a certain Vincent Flanders, which has been collecting slop sites for 11 years.  So, for those who have trouble with English, or just too lazy to understand, I provide a translation of the most interesting information. <br><br>  <strong>My Site - Sucks?</strong>  <strong>Introduction</strong> <br>  <strong>148 Moral Sins, 82 Possible Moral Sins and 2 Designer Super-Duper Testa.</strong> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  ‚ÄúMy Site Sucks?‚Äù <br>  Of all the letters that I receive, these surprise me the most.  Perhaps because I'm used to face it.  When I look in the mirror, I see a balding, fat, aging white guy.  When looking in the mirror, Tom Cruise does not smile at me - I am much taller than him.

      I respond to these emails, pointing people to the FAQ, where it says: ‚ÄúSince I receive a huge number of requests, and I don‚Äôt have enough time for everyone, I cannot criticize your websites.‚Äù <br><br>  I personally didn‚Äôt like this answer, and I found a solution - I‚Äôll give you a tool that will allow you to do everything yourself.  Just look at two simple quizzes and see if your site sucks. <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://www.webpagesthatsuck.com/does-my-web-site-suck/does-my-web-site-suck-checklist-part-one.html">Test number 1</a></strong> <br><br>  This test is so simple that even a <strike>stupid</strike> manager is able to find out if his site sucks.  You ask, how is this possible?  I will answer you. <br><br>  <strong>So, the answer is: If you put at least one tick in this test, your site sucks!</strong>  <strong>Point.</strong> <br><br>  Although, of course, everything is not so simple.  In order to take the test, require some knowledge.  You need to know how your site is made, you also need some knowledge of web design.  If you don‚Äôt know what the MARQUEE tag means (by the way, I don‚Äôt know :), you need to ask the layout designer, comment), or if you don‚Äôt know that the content for the site was made in Word and saved in HTML, Can you take the test? <br><br>  <strong>Note number 1:</strong> <br>  I think no one likes ‚Äúmany bukav‚Äù, so I did not paint what was happening, and did not put links in these tests.  I have been looking at crooked designs for 11 years, and I made a mistake only once (ha! Comment). But this is a completely different topic. <br><br>  <strong>Note 2:</strong> <br>  Yes, you thought correctly - WebPagesThatSuck.com in life will not pass this test.  This site has always been a shit. <br><br>  <strong>Test number 1:</strong> <br>  <strong>First impression / Picture</strong> <br><ul><li>  Our site is made to meet the requirements of our organization (sales, supply), and not the requirements of our visitors. </li><li>  Our site is trying to say what a great company we are, and does not explain how our company will solve my problem. </li><li>  A person from Mars needs more than four seconds to understand what our site is about. </li><li>  A man from Mars cannot determine what to focus on on the main page. </li><li>  A man from Mars cannot determine what to focus on on the current page. </li><li>  Judging by our site, we are not professionals who can be trusted. </li><li>  Looking at our site, users do not have confidence. </li><li>  Our main page (and any other), loads more than four seconds. </li><li>  Looking at the page of the site, users do not really understand why she is. </li><li>  Design elements are located in unexpected places. </li><li>  We still have not decimated unnecessary design elements. </li><li>  We do not yet know which design elements are unnecessary. </li><li>  Our site tupit when javascript is disabled. </li><li>  There is a phrase ‚ÄúWelcome ...‚Äù on our homepage. </li><li>  Our site is made on Flash (and that's how it looks without a flash ...) </li><li>  Navigation on the site is done in Flash. </li><li>  There is a ‚Äúsplash screen‚Äù on our site (unless we sell alcohol, to porn, we are not a casino or a tobacco factory, and our site is not multilingual). </li><li>  The site is required to register before entering. </li><li>  On our site more than one screensaver. </li><li>  The TITLE tag on our site contains something like ‚ÄúNew Document‚Äù or ‚ÄúIndex‚Äù, and not the name of the company, or other things useful for search engines. </li><li>  There is an audio file on our website that starts fonit as soon as the page loads, but we are not a record label and not musicians. </li><li>  I have no idea whether our site looks the same in different browsers. </li><li>  Our site really looks different in different browsers. </li><li>  The most important content by no <a href="http://www.artlebedev.ru/kovodstvo/130/">means fits</a> on the main page (ha! <a href="http://www.artlebedev.ru/kovodstvo/130/">Www.artlebedev.ru/kovodstvo/130/#03 comment per</a> .) </li><li>  There is too little empty space on our pages. </li><li>  On our site there are pop-ups. </li><li>  Our site asks users to install some stupid plugin. </li><li>  A button like ‚ÄúDownload the latest browser‚Äù is hanging on our website. </li><li>  Our site is persistently trying to convey to users what software and equipment we used to develop it. </li><li>  The design of our site was ‚Äúborrowed‚Äù from another site. </li><li>  There are no instructions on our website how to place an order, fill out a form, etc. </li><li>  Our website blocks clicks from the right mouse button because we have paranoia, and we believe that our content deserves to be stolen.  We are also sure that visitors are so stupid that they will not be able to steal it. </li><li>  Our site is made on a template containing an ugly code that is difficult to upgrade and which, frankly, is crooked. </li><li>  We do not label PDF files with the corresponding icon. </li><li>  We do not analyze logs. </li><li>  We have never conducted user testing. </li></ul><br>  So this is just the first part of the first test.  I think that although there are several very contradictory points, still this test may be useful to someone, or at least it may lead to some sensible thoughts. <br><br>  For anyone who wants to get acquainted with the continuation of this test, I ask <a href="http://www.habrahabr.ru/blog/design/3060.html">here</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/1376/">https://habr.com/ru/post/1376/</a></p>
