As a result, IBM gained access to new technologies related to the processing of meteorological data. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  After concluding the original agreement, IBM President Inhi Suh realized that the Weather Company was working on a terrific technology innovation that could turn the world around.  According to Inshi, the merger of this technology with the IBM Watson supercomputer, which can analyze and make predictions, will result in a powerful combination of advanced ideas that will help foresee even small changes in climate.  These technologies can be used in the e-commerce sector, as well as useful to ordinary users.  ‚ÄúI had to get to the new developments and evaluate the technical capabilities of the Weathe Company,‚Äù said IBM's president. <br><br>  According to Inshi, their "meteopartner" found a solution to very difficult technological problems, and work is now beginning on mapping the entire atmosphere, as Google had once created maps of our planet.  The complexity of this process lies in the fact that the climate is not static - the state of the atmosphere is constantly changing, and therefore, to make accurate forecasts, it is necessary to analyze a huge amount of data.  According to Ms. Su, the ability to get accurate information about the weather is very important for the business sector, because every day only because of the quirks of nature companies all over the world lose half a trillion dollars.

      IBM finance director Martin Schr√∂ter also shares Su's positive vision, considering that this platform is good not only for tracking the weather, but can also be scaled in other areas of IT.  As an example, Martin cited wearable gadgets or smart home technology. <br><br>  ‚ÄúWeather Company created a product that processes 4 GB of data every second,‚Äù says Mr. Schr√∂ter about the project.  - This is a huge amount of analytics, which is stored in the cloud.  When the user clicks on the weather forecast for the location he needs, the platform instantly sends him the relevant data.  As a result, the platform processes 30 billion interactions daily. ‚Äù </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/296728/">https://habr.com/ru/post/296728/</a></p>
