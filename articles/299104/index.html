Someone shifted from the position because of the merger of companies, promising a bright, but misty, future.  And someone received a "special" appointment. <br><br>  Someone was ‚Äúfired‚Äù by rumor, someone, on the contrary, left the position twice.

      "Megamind" invites readers to recall these events and make a "commit" of the changes that have occurred. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  1. Ilya Nagibin, deputy editor-in-chief <a href="http://www.kommersant.ru/">of Kommersant,</a> became chief editor of <a href="http://www.forbes.ru/">Forbes.ru</a> . <br><br>  Before him, this post was occupied by Maxim Tovkailo.  Since February, the director of Forbes digital projects has already <a href="https://roem.ru/17-09-2015/207009/kommersant-live-on-rbc-ru/">been working on</a> another Kommersant member, Andrei Konyakhin. <br><br>  2. <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rambler%2526Co">Rambler &amp; Co has</a> <a href="http://rambler-co.ru/live/elena-konstantinova-naznachena-direktorom-po-offlajn-marketingu-ramblerandco">divided</a> the marketing department into two departments responsible for online and offline marketing. <br><br>  The direction of strategic and online marketing will remain under the leadership of Mikhail Dobrov, the offline marketing division will be headed by Elena Konstantinova from Championship.com (part of Rambler &amp; Co holding). <br><br>  The main tasks of Konstantinova will be marketing activities on TV and radio, in outdoor advertising and the press, as well as participation in sponsorship events. <br><br>  3. The French network of media studies <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ipsos">Ipsos</a> united its Russian offices - <a href="http://www.ipsos.ru/ru">Ipsos</a> and <a href="http://www.comcon-2.ru/">Synovate Comcon</a> .  Now the permanent director general of Synovate Comcon, Elena Koneva, no longer manages the business established back in 1991. <br><br>  On the merger under the common brand Ipsos Comcon, research companies announced on Friday, March 4th.  Dmitry Shulgin, who headed the Russian office of Ipsos since 2005, and in 2014 became the regional director of Ipsos in Central and Eastern Europe, will lead the joint structure. <br><br>  Taking into account her [Ms. Koneva] vast experience and authority in the industry, Ipsos is currently considering other positions with Ipsos Group with Elena, <a href="http://ipsos-comcon.ru/content/ipsos_i_synovate_comcon_obedinyayutsya_pod_brendom_ipsos_comcon">according</a> to a company press release. <br><br>  4. In October 2015, the media <a href="https://roem.ru/13-10-2015/210107/stepanov-cut-then-paste/">reported</a> that Yandex had demoted Dmitry Stepanov, who led Mediaservices at <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25AF%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA%25D1%2581">Yandex</a> , to the level of the head of one resource, <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259A%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%259F%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA">KinoPoisk</a> .  <a href="https://megamozg.ru/post/20188/">The story of</a> the unsuccessful restart of "KinoPoisk" just was the cause of personnel changes. <br><br>  But, as it turned out, his departure was far-fetched exaggeration. <br><br>  ‚ÄúI continue to occupy the position of head of the marketing department and head of the direction of Media Services, but now I give up KinoPoisk 90% of the time.‚Äù <br><br>  5. Founder and CEO of <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zynga">Zynga</a> game developer Mark Pincus, who returned to the company in April 2015, again decided to leave his post.  This is <a href="http://blog.zynga.com/2016/03/01/ceo-update-7/">stated</a> in the official blog Zynga. <br><br>  He will be replaced by Frank Zibo, a member of the Zynga Board of Directors, who previously worked at Electronic Arts ( <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Arts">EA</a> ).  Pincus himself will remain in the company as executive chairman of the board of directors. <br><br>  Mark Pincus founded Zynga in 2007.  In April 2014, after a sharp fall in the value of the company, Pincus left her.  Then his place was taken by a native of Microsoft, Don Mattrick.  In April 2015, Pincus returned to Zynga and again headed it. <br><br><h4>  Agent "special" destination </h4><br>  The chairman of the board of directors of the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet_Inc.">Alphabet</a> holding (the parent company of Google), Eric Schmidt, has been appointed head of the innovation council at the US Department of Defense, the department <a href="http://www.defense.gov/News/News-Releases/News-Release-View/Article/684201/statement-by-pentagon-press-secretary-peter-cook-on-the-establishment-of-the-de">said</a> in a March 2 statement. <br><br>  The council will include 12 heads of companies and public organizations.  They will be selected by Schmidt and head of the ministry Ashton Carter. <br><br>  The Council will, if necessary, conduct independent consultations for the leadership of the Ministry on the development and introduction of new technologies.  Representatives of the ministry stressed that the council would not take part in the discussion of military operations. <br><br><h4>  The attraction of unprecedented generosity </h4><br>  The CEO of <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/LinkedIn">LinkedIn, a</a> professional social network, Jeff Weiner, refused the compensation package intended for him for 2015 in favor of the company's employees.  Weiner made this decision after the fall in the value of LinkedIn shares by 40% in February to support employees, Re / Code <a href="http://recode.net/2016/03/02/linkedin-ceo-jeff-weiner-is-passing-his-14-million-stock-grant-to-employees/">writes</a> , citing documents from the US Securities and Exchange Commission. <br><br>  The compensation package of shares is paid to the top managers of the company annually.  The company did not specify what the size of the package.  The source of the publication in the social network, claims that its value reaches $ 14 million. <br><br>  The size of Weiner's compensation package for 2014 <a href="">was</a> $ 13 million. <br><br>  In October 2015, Megamozg <a href="https://megamozg.ru/post/20544/">reported</a> that <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A2%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580">Twitter's</a> chief executive of the microblogging <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A2%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580">Twitter</a> service gave Dorsey $ 200 million worth of company shares to employees.  This is about 1% of all shares issued at that time.  At the same time, Dorsey noted that it is better to be content with a small part of something large than with a large part of a small one.  He believed that the company's affairs would go faster thanks to his ‚Äúwide gesture‚Äù. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/299104/">https://habr.com/ru/post/299104/</a></p>
