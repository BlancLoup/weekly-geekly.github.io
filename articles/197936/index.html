  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Lexand A802 review: 8-inch tablet with non-standard "iron"</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> Until recently, inexpensive tablets of Asian origin, sold under local brands, were mostly based on Allwinner, Rockchip and Amlogic processors.  This ‚Äútrinity‚Äù has very tightly occupied the budget segment, but lately MediaTek processors are increasingly appearing on tablets at the price of 5-8 thousand rubles.  This is not surprising: the platforms of the manufacturers listed above are mostly not highly integrated, which results primarily in the absence of Bluetooth and GPS support.  You can add these modules (as well as the 3G modem), but this requires some effort from the developers.  Therefore, with rare exceptions, they don‚Äôt bother - all the more so because local brands often do not insist on such a ‚Äúcomplete set‚Äù.  In the solutions MediaTek there is also Bluetooth, and GPS, and - in some models - also 3G.  At a comparable price. <br><br>  So, when I first saw the Lexand A802 tablet specs, I decided that it was using some of the latest MediaTek chipsets - this was hinted at by the presence of 4 cores, a Bluetooth adapter and a GPS receiver.  However, after a little closer examination of the performance characteristics, it turned out that Huawei's platform, HiSilicon K3V2, was installed in A802.  For understanding: previously it was used only in smartphones and tablets of Huawei itself, but the Chinese manufacturer didn‚Äôt supply it to the side (correct, if I am mistaken). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ad9/6fa/2ba/ad96fa2bad8671b63bd4e8d9dcedc9d3.jpg"><a name="habracut"></a>

      Well, the more reason to get acquainted with the Lexand A802 closer.  I will not specifically spread the thought on the tree, since this tablet is nothing extraordinary.  This is the usual "workhorse" without any particularly striking features.  However, it was not without curious little things.  For example, after the release of the iPad mini, the B-brands (and even some first-tier companies, for example, Acer and MSI) started to rivet clones of the Apple model, but only on Android.  All these clones have 7.85-inch screens - well, to fit the ‚Äúipad‚Äù in design and in size.  Lexand A802 is slightly different: it has a screen with a diagonal of 8 inches.  Yes, the difference seems to be small.  But, I remember, a couple of weeks ago I had the opportunity to hold in my hands something that's so nameless 7.85-inch.  And now I am holding an A802 in my hands.  And I must say that the difference in convenience is still there (albeit small) in favor of a larger model. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f01/0ae/961/f010ae961356590efeb96c8890a84fd4.jpg"><br><br>  Lexand A802 attracts the quality of the case.  Behind - metal, on the sides - pretty sane quality plastic.  I have a personal first-generation Nexus 7, and so it looks like a much cheaper thing on the background of the A802 (precisely in terms of the case). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/93e/56e/368/93e56e368f5daa4ae9c1dc72adaf09cb.jpg"><br><br>  It's nice that the microSD slot has a plug.  Not once I saw open sockets in tablets, and even insufficient depth - because of this, a piece of flash drive sticks out of the case, which is unaesthetic. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/63c/8bc/04f/63c8bc04fe8c25ea253e238146b84ab2.jpg"><br><br>  Screen A802 is not particularly impressed.  Typically, these tablets IPS-matrix (that some brands are instilled and called "ah-pi-esom" cheap "ti-en", I will not tell - this is a separate story), but here it is just TN.  If you look at the screen below and to the left, then the picture almost does not fade, but if it is to the right and from the top, it is inverted to the full.  Well, in general, the colors are some faded and not too natural - it is clear that the display is not expensive. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3ef/e4f/8e8/3efe4f8e82897970d575b8b62fb6fc7d.jpg"><br><br>  However, in the process of testing the A802, I came to the conclusion that an extremely small number of users can evaluate the quality of the screen.  I showed the Nexus 7 and Lexand A802 to my parents, wife, and one buddy;  showed - and offered to choose the best screen.  In Nexus 7, only a friend jabbed his finger, but the first "trio" pointed to Lexand.  How so?  The answers are about the same: well, he's MORE.  But the quality of the picture all, it turns out, the drum. <br><br>  However, I noticed that the color of the screen is quite comfortable for reading.  I myself prefer to study literary works on the E Ink screens, but on the Lexand A802 from time to time you can also read something.  Especially if the "twist" the brightness to a minimum.  In this mode, the device can hold on a single charge of the battery for about 7 hours. <br><br>  Like almost all tablet computers with a diagonal of 7.85-8 inches, the Lexand A802 display has a 4: 3 aspect ratio.  The resolution is 1024 x 768 pixels.  The screen covering, apparently, is plastic, and it gets dirty almost instantly. <br><br>  As I said above, A802 interested me primarily with its chipset.  In practice, I tell you, the special advantages of Huawei K3V2 does not have.  Yes, of course, Bluetooth and GPS are great (and support for Wi-Fi Direct was also found in this LeXande), but everything else is average.  So, the computational cores here have the ARM Cortex-A9 architecture (40 nm process technology) - it has been used in ARM processors since 2011 (or even earlier).  The graphics accelerator is also, to put it mildly, non-standard - Vivante GC4000.  By itself, it may be not bad, but only because of the rarity, game developers do not always sharpen their products for it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/599/420/3c7/5994203c78e543ee0041d471f09fb05a.png"><br><br>  For example, Real Racing and Dark Meadow did not start at all.  "Iron Man 3" starts with brakes, but, fortunately, in the game itself there are almost no lags (that is, there are fading pictures, but rarely).  Dead Trigger stretches to full screen, slightly upsetting the proportions of characters and controls (I don‚Äôt know here - maybe this game simply doesn‚Äôt have a version for 1024 x 768 resolution, which is why all tablets have a 4: 3 aspect ratio and the corresponding resolution loaded option under 1024 x 600);  However, it does not interfere with play. <br><br>  For a number of reasons, I now can‚Äôt buy games on Google Play, so different versions of Asphalt could not be driven.  I read the forums - people write that on Huawei tablets with a K3V2 chipset they go without problems.  Most likely, these toys will earn on Lexand A802. <br><br>  Benchmarks: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a9f/43f/f26/a9f43ff26b0f4ba410da5ec8746a8a3f.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/efb/9a0/900/efb9a0900f72d7d9113a72ee4755f2b5.png"><br><br>  Something like this.  In general, with the games Lexand A802 is friendly, but you can wait for "tricks".  (However, the situation with toys on models based on Allwinner, Rockchip and Amlogic chipsets is often no better.) But there are no lags in the interface - everything is fast and smooth.  Video in Full HD 1080p plays without problems, and it can still be output to the TV - the tablet has a microHDMI port.  True, if you watch a movie on the A802 screen, then the HD720p resolution will be quite enough.  In this mode, the battery lasts about 4 hours with a hook.  Not very much by modern standards, but I also saw tablets for comparable money, which ‚Äúdied‚Äù after one and a half hours of video. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/98b/b8d/c48/98bb8dc486cdc78752b82cd3aae1a6bd.jpg"><br><br>  Cameras in the Lexand A802, as usual, two - by 0.3 and 3.2 megapixels.  I will not talk a lot about the results of their efforts - I have never seen a budget tablet that would be acceptable (not even ‚Äúgood‚Äù or ‚Äúexcellent‚Äù, but at least ‚Äúacceptable‚Äù) I would photograph.  Here the situation is exactly the same.  The rear camera can record video in the HD720p, its quality is also not very high. <br><br>  Photo examples: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/78a/dce/628/78adce628473cf71dae6e0f73bdc82fa.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6f0/26b/236/6f026b236cfa37f8e35f939012164c29.jpg"><br><br>  With software the situation is as follows.  The Lexand A802 is Android 4.1.2 Jelly Bean.  However, some Huawei products with K3V2 come with Android 4.2, so that the corresponding assembly for the specified chipset is created.  I do not know whether the firmware will be released with the new version of the OS for the hero of this review, but I would not completely rule out this possibility. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/31d/c72/f26/31dc72f2615af3978e618d2aae31035e.png"><br><br>  Soft, meanwhile, quite familiar.  Well, that is, as usual - this is not quite ‚Äúpure‚Äù Android, but a certain version for the 4: 3 aspect ratio.  From the usual Android, which is, for example, in the ASUS Nexus 7, the variant from the A802 differs in the arrangement of some panels and virtual controls.  So, the button to call the application menu is not at the bottom, but in the upper right corner of the screen.  If you hold the tablet horizontally, this arrangement is quite convenient - it is just under your thumb.  If you take it vertically, then you have to reach for the key. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/68b/2d3/0db/68b2d30dba9113078d1628182bf64d7a.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/afa/ce6/373/aface63733090f330a1f2f2736c8f677.png"><br><br>  Otherwise, there is nothing to ‚Äúprofit‚Äù here.  Well, Android and Android.  It looks like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d7f/276/bb7/d7f276bb7e69f6b290d8906a73afb975.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/810/99c/024/81099c024168ae92abb5c7c537657aa8.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b73/5d8/391/b735d8391912acdf3e61807cda8a8e5c.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4d5/350/4f2/4d53504f2d56f21166ee5466878ee8c3.png"><br><br>  Additional software missing.  In order not to list the applications, the names of which, and so everyone has long been known for the mass of other devices, made them one screen on the screenshot above. <br><br>  Only Navitel Navigator stands out against the general background.  True, in the Lexand A802 it is presented only in the 30-day demo version.  Then either demolish or buy. <br><br>  Well, I praise the developers for the sane set of software.  And then I saw in separate tablet computers a full set of free Yandex services, Mail.ru and so on. <br><br>  Summarize the experience.  Lexand A802 - a product that does not cause vivid emotions, but does not have any frankly "failing" features (against the background of analogs).  I wouldn't take it myself, because I like more ‚Äúcharismatic‚Äù gadgets.  But if suddenly some friends come to me and say - they say, we are standing in the store and choosing a cheap tablet, there is an A802 and a model X, then I would advise you to look towards Lexand.  Because tablets of this level are always a lottery, but not always a lottery with a win.  There is a gain here, albeit not a huge one: the device is at least stable and well assembled.  At the same time, I can not fail to note that the A802 is still a little expensive: 8,000.  He would fall in price for a thousand and a half - just for justice. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/197936/">https://habr.com/ru/post/197936/</a></p>
