Norbert Wiener's seminar poured oil on fire, where Liklider became infected with ‚Äúcybernetics‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/975/c2a/d68/975c2ad6860724302afb183b9122888b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In 1957, Lieblider became vice president of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBN_Technologies">Bolt Beranek and Newman, Inc.</a>  (BBN), a research center for military orders, where he acquired the first <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-1">PDP-1</a> computer and for the first time demonstrated the principle of time-sharing. <br><br>  In 1959, on the basis of the experience gained in working with the PDP-1, Liklider wrote the book Libraries of the Future, and in 1960 he received an even more widely accepted article ‚ÄúMan-Computer Symbiosis‚Äù.  This essentially philosophical article contains speculative answers to some of the questions posed at the time in the first seminars organized by Norbert Wiener.  The article became a kind of ideological basis for the creation of the first time-sharing systems, and subsequently for computer networks. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ecd/43e/962/ecd43e9623a1e89d9d15e0243b028680.jpg" alt="image" align="right">  Published articles attracted the attention of the then Director of ARPA Jack Ruins (in the photo), he set himself the task of not just improving the existing military computing systems, but of making a fundamental breakthrough in this area.  By that time, it was obvious that the methods of human-computer interaction (packet mode, perfovod) were hopelessly outdated. <br><br>  Liklider was one of the few who spoke about this, and the choice fell on him.  He recalled his decision to accept the offer as follows: <br>  ‚ÄúI realized that Jack aimed not only at using interactive computing for defense management, but much more widely, so in October 1963 I moved to the Pentagon and became the director of IPTO.‚Äù <br><br clear="right"><h5>  Man ‚Äì computer symbiosis </h5><br>  <a href="http://memex.org/licklider.pdf">PDF</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/73e/a8f/cb1/73ea8fcb10bc20966eb0972507c9fbae.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Unlike many supporters of AI, Liklider never believed that there would be a war against cars.  He wrote in the article: ‚ÄúPeople will set goals, formulate hypotheses, define criteria and carry out assessment.  Computers will do routine work to clear the way for technical and scientific discoveries. ‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1e0/458/f02/1e0458f02ae7da2482abbe007a73362d.jpg" alt="image" align="right"><br>  <i>‚ÄúPeople are noisy, narrow-band devices, but in their nervous system there are a great many parallel and simultaneously active channels.</i>  <i>Relative to humans, computers are very fast and accurate, but they are limited by the ability to perform only one or a few simple operations at a time.</i>  <i>People easily adapt, having the ability to ‚Äúprogram themselves according to circumstances,‚Äù based on the incoming information.</i>  <i>Computers are straightforward, limited to those that have been programmed in advance. ‚Äù</i> <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">original</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  "Men are noisy, narrow-band devices, but they have very many parallel and simultaneously active channels.

It is decoded in different ways: ‚ÄúMan and Computer‚Äù (Man and Computer), ‚ÄúComputer as a tool of knowledge‚Äù (Machine-Aided Cognition) or, finally, ‚ÄúComputer with Distributed Access‚Äù (Multi-Access).  MIT had a healthy mainframe that was designed so that up to 30 users, each sitting at its own terminal, could work at the same time.  Liklider also opened similar projects at Stanford, University of California, Berkeley, University of California, Los Angeles. <br><br>  As part of the MAC project, Minsky and <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259C%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8,_%25D0%2594%25D0%25B6%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD">McCarthy</a> worked on artificial intelligence.  Here they wrote the first lines of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multics">Multics</a> operating system code. <br><br>  The MAC project has become the world's first online community in which there were prototypes of chat, email, forums, and free software exchange. <br><br><h5>  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intergalactic_Computer_Network">Global computer network</a> </h5><br>  Liclider made a half-joking newsletter addressed to "Members and Affiliates of the Intergalactic Computer Network". <br>  He described a picture of an open electronic intermediary system for the information interaction of governments, institutions, corporations and individuals. <br><br clear="right">  Liklider shares memories of "those times." <br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/SN--t9jXQc0%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhiWLJ2EFRD6CD6vCq_NPRVEC8V-cA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><hr><br>  Together with the company <a href="http://www.edsd.ru/ru/uslugi/poektirovanie">Edison we</a> continue the spring marathon of publications. <br><br>  I will try to get to the primary sources of IT-technologies, to understand how they thought and what concepts were in the minds of the pioneers, what they dreamed about, how they saw the world of the future.
