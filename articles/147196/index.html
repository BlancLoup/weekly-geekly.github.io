Of course it is difficult to find a balance between constant endless rapid and prolonged sales, which you are obliged to call in your customer base.  On the other hand, a client who is tired of numerous, senseless and incoherent mailings may be disappointed not only in life, but also in you.  How to find a balance between the two poles - mandatory sales and the formation of the brand image? <br><br><h4>  How not to do </h4><br>  From some point of view, branding for mailing lists is absolutely not needed.  We already anticipate a comment in the comments that you can expect from you (and we always welcome your comments and opinions), namely: you might say that in conditions of weak competition, when you do not need to fight for a client, he will come.  In this case, you can absolutely not think about such subtleties as the formation of your brand. <br><br>  Indeed, the client is looking for the store on the Internet where it will be cheaper.  Then looks at usability.  And last but not least - whether you have a brand or not.  This situation is also possible, and due to the client‚Äôs rather low need for sophisticated service, he simply does not wait for him.  And if he doesn't trust anyone - why will he trust you? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  However, it is not necessary to go to the other extreme, when the client is literally sent to three letters in response to any claim on his part.  Do you not like something in us?  Get out, others will come.  Such statements made in clear text can scare off potential customers.

      When creating this article, I really wanted to find examples of extreme neglect of brand management in the mailing list, but apart from the erroneously indicated gender or other data, I could not find any requests like ‚ÄúDear Username‚Äù.  However, examples of unsuccessful communication with the client were found on open resources and in correspondence with some CRM that followed the mailing list. <br><br>  In this regard, the <a href="http://www.specstalprokat.ru/vopros-otvet-7.html">answer of one of the online stores</a> was quite epic: when a client asked why the price offered to him was significantly different from the price indicated initially, he received the answer that as long as he doesn‚Äôt understand anything, he can only go broke there are such unlucky clients.  It is logical to assume that if such a company started a newsletter, there would be no talk of branding. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/88f/b98/d17/88fb98d175b5305d71a31d182babb143.png"><br><br>  Not only private companies often treat the client as if ‚ÄúI am innocent, he came.‚Äù  Although the client actually came by himself.  But after he was shown this, he is unlikely to return.  When your humble servant wrote on one of the television channels to the support service to find out why my favorite TV series was replaced by another one, and, having come from work, I can no longer enjoy my favorite series, the answer came like this: <br><blockquote>  If you don‚Äôt like the NAME OF THE SERIAL, ABOVE THE REPLACE, don‚Äôt look through force. <br>  Both series very well "shot" and found their huge audience. <br>  If you do not like it, it means that you are not the audience of the series, but you should not blame the series. <br>  It is easier and more correct to say ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt understand this series‚Äù or ‚Äúthis series is not interesting for me‚Äù. <br>  Respectfully, <br>  site support team. </blockquote>  Nice, pleasant letter, but its essence comes down to the fact that if you don‚Äôt like it, we still have a huge audience that everyone is happy with - what do you stand out for?  After such support, I, perhaps, will really look at something else, and I will download new series of the series from torrents - my favorite actors are not to blame for the support team of the website‚Äôs channel was wrong. <br><br>  I have to communicate with the support service of the site or mailings of foreign-language companies, and in such cases the answers come in completely different.  The so-called soft skills of customer service sometimes strongly influence my psyche, which is not spoiled by Russian realities.  I could not understand the English wording on one of the sites and wrote in support that they had not clearly written.  I think they could well answer - ‚ÄúEveryone understands, but you do not understand.  You did not try to open a dictionary, learn English, or even use a Russian site instead of torturing yourself and others? ‚ÄùThe answer came something like this: <br><blockquote>  You are right, the formulation of the function does not sound quite clear, we also paid attention to it.  It means that you can ... &lt;...&gt; also you can ... &lt;...&gt; We hope that you will be comfortable using our resource in the future.  Contact us! <br>  company customer service </blockquote>  Do we need this when there are not 100 TV channels, not 20 door stores in each city, and so on?  No, in conditions of weak competition, with a small amount of the company, you can continue to neglect communication with the client.  You can easily afford to respond to the client in the style of "he was a fool, where did he look?" However, only for the time being, until this "freebie" is over.  Another question is whether to think about the distant future in a quite convenient present.  We think it's worth it! <br><br><h4>  What is worth thinking about </h4><br>  Each of your letters causes certain emotions in the client.  Most often, we do not enter into communication with the client after distribution, however, if we see such an opportunity, then the more dissatisfied the client is, the more emotionally he treats us.  So, he practically gives us all the cards in his hands: comfort his irritation, and you can win the trust of the client on an emotional level. <br><br>  Do not neglect the use of soft skills in solving conflict situations in particular, but also use them in normal situations.  In fact, your every letter in the mailing list is an act of communication with a client.  It carries several functions: <br><br><ol><li>  Informational </li><li>  Commercial </li><li>  Emotional </li></ol><br>  Information function is expressed in the fact that you bring to the customer information about the new service, sale, product.  The commercial component is manifested in a competent call to action and its implementation.  The emotional component is directly related to creating a relationship with your company, its image, image, and its brand.  So each of your letters is a tremendous opportunity to both play into the hands of your reputation, and ‚Äúwet‚Äù it. <br><br>  In order to properly implement an emotional function and make a contribution to the formation of your brand's perception, the simplest thing you can do is recall the biblical truth: ‚ÄúDo to others the way you want them to do to you.‚Äù  Remember this, and do better with the client.  What causes confidence in you?  What treatment will alienate you?  What will make you feel comfortable in communicating with this company?  Answer these questions and correct the text of your regular mailing with the conclusions that you make. <br><br><h4>  Why is this necessary? </h4><br>  Every small company dreams of one day becoming one of the leaders and capturing the minds of people.  And the credibility of the brand allows you to take root in the minds.  If your goods are of adequate quality, if you communicate with your customers at the proper level, do not drive them away and do not point them at the door, you allow them to feel comfortable in your territory.  So, you encourage desire and need to come back and stay still. <br><br><h4>  What can I communicate with the client? </h4><br>  It is easy and simple to quarrel with a client, because you have a reason to talk, which both actively support.  But what to talk with him in everyday life?  Do not worry if you encounter this problem.  For the same reason, relatives often quarrel: there are no topics for conversation, but I want to talk.  Swearing is also a kind of communication. <br><br>  In order for the client to have the opportunity to speak, give him informational reasons.  Offer the client: <br><ol><li>  Leave a review after purchase (posted on the site, they also help to build confidence in you) </li><li>  Share Product Related Story </li><li>  Share your opinion about the service (for example, in the form of a survey) </li><li>  Share your feedback on the usefulness of mailing </li><li>  The experience of social networks shows that customers are happy to participate in contests where you need to "post photos." </li><li>  Let the client tell you what he would like to see on your site, in your range of goods or services. </li></ol><br>  Enter into a dialogue with the client, take into account his wishes, make this communication public.  The first step to this can be made through your regular newsletter, and this trend can be supported by special sections of the site.  And, of course, in any response to a comment or request from your client, no matter how angry he is, do not snap.  Imagine that this dissatisfied client is not an ungrateful boor at all, but simply a person who has not understood you who is tired after work and from the first call.  If you can only help him a little and - sympathize - he will be able, like everyone else, to make sure what a delightful online store, service or TV channel you have.  In the end, everyone wants to feel like someone needed.  This natural human need can be a marketing tool for generating demand for your products and services.
