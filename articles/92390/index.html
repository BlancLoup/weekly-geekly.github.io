The fact that this is a contest and why it is needed here has already been written more than once, with much more worthy and enlightened authors.  If you have not heard of it yet, I recommend following <a href="http://software.intel.com/ru-ru/articles/contest-atom-developer-challenge/">the secret link</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/aa2/1e6/8b8/aa21e68b84b98ef2c6895be0365c8d46.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  And here - about the main thing.  In the category of "Home and Style" won Russian Dmitry Ryzhkov.  His application My Little Artist won the hearts of the jury and brought the author a very weighty prize - $ 10,000. Dmitry lives in Tolyatti, and as soon as the results became known, I contacted him by phone to ask a few questions, including the most important one. <br><a name="habracut"></a>

      <i>Dmitry, let's start from afar - how did you get to the competition?</i> <br><br>  I think everything turned out quite harmoniously here.  I once started to participate in the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/intel/blog/69377/">"Five weeks with Intel"</a> , which were held in Habr√©.  And this was my first experience of this kind, because I had never participated in any competitions before, I considered it a waste of time.  I always thought that there would be someone smarter, luckier than me, and since victory does not shine, so why waste time?  He is already missing.  In general, he did not believe in his own strength or good luck.  And then I decided to try it, thankfully, as Intel itself somehow organized the competition correctly, making it very ‚Äúfavorable‚Äù to participation.  All I had to do was to ask interesting questions, which I always did well.  Employees of the company answered them, and it was very interesting, which was already a kind of reward!  In general, I won that competition, and it became for me a kind of incentive that helped to believe in myself. <br><br>  <i>And then?</i> <br><br>  And then, in the tenth of December last year, I, as an ISN user, ‚Äúdropped‚Äù a message into the box.  They say that there is a competition among applications for devices on the Atom platform.  Being intrigued, I registered with the Intel Atom Developer Program community and started to figure out what it is and what this SDK is eating ... First I was a little confused by the name of the SDK - the Intel Atom Developer Program Software Development Kit.  I thought that there was something that would help write applications optimized for Atom.  But no, this is a set of libraries that allows you to integrate the ‚Äúembedded‚Äù key check, the toolkit for generating error reports, etc. <br><br>  I already had one application, quite suitable for mobile devices, and I decided that I would set it up.  I did everything according to the instructions, downloaded the SDK, integrated it into my application and sent the application to the competition.  I waited, I hoped.  The first date for the completion of the contest was set for January 4th, then it was moved to the 20th.  Finally, the winners were announced and ... I was not among them.  However, I was not very upset, because among the first hundred developers who sent their applications, I received a consolation prize - a netbook.  Plus, they immediately announced that in March we will be waiting for new contests. <br><br>  March came, Intel kept the promise, announced the conditions of the competition.  And for me began a month of sleepless nights.  As it turned out, the most difficult thing is not to write, but to come up with an application that will be popular.  I needed some kind of idea that distinguishes my programs from those of competitors.  In total for the month I sent 7 programs ... And one of them - My Little Artist - won. <br><br>  <i>I launched it yesterday and at first I was a little ... surprised.</i>  <i>However, imagining myself in the role of a child, I understood the logic of the judges.</i>  <i>Do I understand correctly that you wrote a program for yourself?</i> <br><br>  To be honest, the program that won the competition was not originally intended to be sent out of the family.  I wrote it for my two-year-old son, a great lover of fumbling on the touchpad.  For his entertainment, a netbook won on Habr√© was highlighted.  It gave me a chance to do some work on my laptop while my son was drawing something. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/307/2f0/f56/3072f0f56686ac523f42bf4eca2db95c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  At first, we didn‚Äôt dabble in Paint, but then I decided to write, let's say, a program written under a netbook, i.e.  make the most of its screen, leaving only the minimum set of tools and colors for drawing. <br>  Posted  The tests were successful.  The son, of course, did not begin to draw something meaningful, but she took it clearly more than Pait, plus he had less chance to get on the menu or accidentally quit the program. <br><br>  Again, I didn‚Äôt want to send My Litle Artist to the contest, arguing - ‚Äútoo simple, who might like this?‚Äù.  But, looking at how the son is messing with her, I thought something else: well, yes, simple, but on the whole screen and without complicated palettes with a choice of color.  And without a heap of rarely used tools for drawing, confusing and simply stupid any child.  It‚Äôs quite childish, netbook in the full sense of the word, as I understand it.  Apparently, the judges pondered, just like me, choosing her for the simplicity and effective use of the small size of the screen netbook.  Probably, they also have children of the same age :) <br><br>  <i>As you know, even better than me, Atom is used not only in computers with Microsoft operating systems.</i>  <i>Any plans to make My Little Artist multi-platform?</i> <br><br>  Currently, there is only a version of the program created under Windows, but nothing prevents to port it under MeeGo.  What I may do in the future. <br><br>  <i>And how difficult is it to enter the program?</i>  <i>Doesn't "prelude" discourage all desire, as often happens?</i> <br><br>  No, it seems to me that the entrance to the program is quite easy.  All you need to do is download the SDK, integrate it into your program and send it for review ( <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/development/81438/">I already wrote an article on this topic on Habr√©</a> ).  If you do everything according to the instructions, there are practically no questions. <br><br>  If they do, then the answers to almost everything can be found in the forum.  The main thing is not to be lazy to search.  If you are interested in something unique, about which no one has yet asked, you can ask your question.  At the forum there are both program participants and representatives of Intel, and they are not just registered there, but lead very lively discussions.  Representatives of the company themselves answer any questions, are ready to participate in discussions and welcome any suggestions and suggestions. <br><br>  <i>According to a personal feeling, is this a program for amateurs, or for harsh professionals, whose application development is a matter of life?</i> <br><br>  In my opinion, the Atom Developer program may be interesting to developers as such, it does not matter whether you are a professional or an amateur.  Although lovers it may seem more interesting or, to be more precise, useful.  Given that the store is just opening, you can have time to send an application that can not only, for example, win the competition, but will also be successfully sold in the future.  The first to get to the right place at the right time is always easier.  It is important to understand what place is necessary.  Contests are contests, but Intel's main goal is to create a store selling apps.  Contests are now needed only for intensive filling of the store with interesting programs. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e67/1f5/344/e671f5344ab9f59523916ae3dd38c34e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  My experience shows that such programs can be effectively using the capabilities of a netbook or Atom-based devices, creating new areas for the use of the latter.  In my case, this is the transformation of a computer into a good educational toy for a small child. <br><br>  <i>Between us, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãbuying software with one click on a PC has not yet gained any particular popularity.</i>  <i>And yet, seeing the seriousness of Intel's intentions, one can understand that everything was thought out and invented there.</i>  <i>But in your opinion, AppUp will manifest itself on mobile platforms, or on relatively large computers too?</i> <br><br>  I think that AppUp, no matter on which device, is a fairly convenient way to buy software for users and, accordingly, a promising way to sell software for developers. <br>  For buyers, I see convenience in the fact that there is no need to surf the Internet in search of the desired program.  It is enough to register once and buy the necessary programs in AppUp - with a normal description, with screenshots, with reviews of other users.  Plus, if you had to, for example, reinstall the system, then the newly purchased programs can be returned to the site directly from AppUp.  You can also check for updates.  Centralized solution, which in my opinion looks quite promising. <br>  For the developer, this is another ‚Äúshowcase‚Äù with which you can sell your programs.  Considering that this project belongs to Intel, I personally have no doubt that it has a great future. <br>  Now Intel is promoting the store mainly among developers, and, let's face it, not very many users.  But I have already earned my first ten bucks.  :) <br><br>  <i>Main question.</i>  <i>Tell me honestly, how will you spend $ 10,000 in prize money?</i> <br><br>  You know, while I was sending the programs, there were a lot of ideas on this subject, and after I won, I was a little confused.  I want to travel, go somewhere with my family, where I have not yet decided.  Given this, I want to give advice to those who are just going to participate in Intel contests - be prepared for anything, especially for victory.  :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/92390/">https://habr.com/ru/post/92390/</a></p>
