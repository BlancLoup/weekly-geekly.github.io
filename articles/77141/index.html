But now I would not like to discuss who did what and when or did not.  I would like to discuss what we have now and where we can move on.  After all, if you think about it, the problem now is not at all in the fact that we have few young and talented scientists.  And not even that in our country there is no money.  The thing is a huge, bottomless abyss, which was formed between science and those who are able to implement and sell its results. <br><br>  Now it is very popular to blame all the problems on the crisis, but as for innovation, I personally noticed a significant increase in interest from investors.  The fact is that those who were engaged in industrial production before the crisis (whether concrete or metal) are now sitting with huge amounts of cash and do not know where to put it, because their usual business has not given signs of life for a year. <br><br>  Continued under the cut <br><a name="habracut"></a>

      In addition, the constant hype in the press around nanocubays stirs interest in innovation.  But the thoughts of small funds and business angels are always reduced to the question: ‚ÄúWhere can I get them?‚Äù.  You can certainly talk a lot about grants and interaction with educational institutions, but this is more the way of large companies and the state.  And how will the authors of the idea meet with those who are willing to invest amounts from $ 100,000 to $ 1,000,000. Because now, there is often a situation when an investor expects the author to come to him himself.  And the author is waiting for someone to pay attention to his grandiose development, although no special efforts are being made to this.  And if the Internet startups are becoming increasingly popular in recent times, then the matter with chemists, physicists and the list does not improve further.  As a result, funds are taken for the implementation of extremely dubious projects, and inventors are starting to do business and due to lack of knowledge / money / experience / leadership skills fail. <br><br>  Therefore, from the position of the representative of the investor, I would like to ask the habrasoobschestvo.  If you do not take the Internet and software startups, then how do you think, in what direction should investors move?  What initiatives should be taken?  And the same thing from the position of the authors of ideas.  What initiatives should be taken? <br><br>  I want to understand where that intermediate meeting point should be.  After all, many investors anyway what to invest.  In quasi-nano-vazilinovye tubes or lenses for the telescope.  The main thing is to collect a diversified and potentially highly profitable portfolio of projects.  And very often, most of the applications received are reduced to ‚Äúcreating an Internet portal of the city N‚Äù </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/77141/">https://habr.com/ru/post/77141/</a></p>
