  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Is it worth explaining the strategy to your employees?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <i>It turns out that of all the strategies developed, only 10% are implemented.</i>  <i>What is the difference between successful organizations and what stops the rest?</i> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/86c/c21/7ac/86cc217acc138505108140bc2f56df3b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Ten years ago, I was quite surprised when I learned that only 30% of ERP system implementations are considered successful.  Three years ago, I learned that only 20% of corporate social networking implementations are successful (now more, because we have taken up this business).  And so, last week, reading Jim Houden's The <a href="http://www.ozon.ru/context/detail/id/5647239/"><u>Art of Involvement</u></a> , I learned that there are things that are being introduced even worse.  These are company development strategies.  And of all the strategies developed, only 10% are implemented. <br><br>  And the main problem lies in the fact that the strategy is created by the leaders, and their ordinary employees are implementing them.  And inept leadership, inefficient teamwork, unwillingness to take initiative, inability to adapt to change kill a good idea.  For the strategy to be implemented, it is necessary that all people in your organization understand, accept and apply new ways of working.  The task is extremely difficult, and I really want to know in advance that all your efforts are not aimed at nothing.  But, alas, your name is not Martin McFly and Doc Emmett Brown, and you cannot predict the future.  So let's at least try to estimate the costs. <a name="habracut"></a>
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>

      So, each employee must understand and adopt for himself a new strategy.  What happens if you just force - you can see in the picture above.  This is not our way.  We believe that the employee should independently come to the formulation of the strategy, independently participate in its comprehension.  To do this, you must provide the necessary conditions.  The most suitable - group workshop with a break from production. <br><br>  In assessing the budget, we will reject the costs of developing and conducting seminars for all external trainers.  Discarding the likelihood that working employees will come to the wrong conclusions about the company's strategy, this is not the question now.  The question is how long it will take to conduct workshops.  My rough estimate is two days.  The first day of work on the independent formulation of the strategy, the second day on at least some reflection and consolidation of the material.  Within two hundred business days of one fiscal year, this amounts to 1% of the net loss per event.  But we need a constant process and an <a href="http://supereon.ru/cases/%3Fe%3D21"><u>intracorporate community</u></a> for the permanent involvement of staff in the implementation of the strategy. <br><br>  So maybe the game is worth the candle and not worth it?  Who is ready to consciously refuse from 1% of the annual turnover on the simple understanding of the essence of the new strategy by people?  It is hardly necessary for organizations operating in the established stable industry.  Or for those who have not yet finished their time with 10% of the lucky ones who successfully implemented their strategies.  So we live on the sly, until we feel the onset of personal disruption (*).  And then the transformation begins for real.  Here are some examples. <br><br>  At some point, PepsiCo realized that it was either collapsing or becoming a company offering a full range of beverages.  And the staff did not accept the new strategy.  Then, for several tens of thousands of their employees, they had a specially created strategic game under the slogan ‚ÄúRevolution in the street of drinks‚Äù.  And they ensured that employees not only agreed with the new strategy, but also gained confidence in the ability to change their approach to business at the level of their duties. <br><br>  When Hong Kong sensed competition from Singapore, Shanghai and Sydney, they sent 14,000 of their employees for four days to discuss competitiveness issues under the slogan "Typhoon of Change."  As a result, 80% of employees recognized the need for significant changes and acquired a positive attitude towards turning Hong Kong into an international center. <br><br>  When German Oscarovich Gref realized that his main competitor was not any bank, but Google, he simply began to fully buy out the departments of the best universities to create the corporate university of Sberbank.  And see how Sberbank is changing!  I‚Äôm seriously thinking about whether to become their client? <br><br>  *** <br><br>  Total.  Most strategies are not implemented in practice.  To implement a strategy, you need to involve all your staff in change.  This is an expensive process.  It is implemented by those organizations that truly feel threatened by their business.  We help <a href="http://supereon.ru/services/%3Fe%3D14"><u>create an intracorporate community</u></a> to support strategic change. <br><br>  <i>(*) Disruption.</i>  <i>Translated into simple Russian language - the word of four letters, of which it is usually proposed to make the word "happiness."</i>  <i>It comes when someone else starts doing the same thing as you, better than you, and at lower cost.</i> <br><br>  <b>Vladimir Ivanitsa</b> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ivanitsa"><u>Facebook</u></a> |  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vivanitsa"><u>LinkedIn</u></a> <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/295194/">https://habr.com/ru/post/295194/</a></p>
