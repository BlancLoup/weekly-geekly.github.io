On the one hand, tablet reviews are already there.  There is a video.  "Anboxing" on YouTube too.  What for?

      So that you can understand how much the author has a biased opinion of the device, available for comparison: a stationary computer (full stuffing).  A laptop for games, a dozen for work on the road (Sonya weighs under a kilo).  Nedonout Asus EEE (reader with translator + putty and company).  To draw the Vacumu bamboo.  And Microsoft Surface Pro bursts into this idyll ... <br><br><h4>  Part Two, Positive </h4><br><br>  Odes are sung to the device all over the Internet, the device is supposedly ‚Äúfire‚Äù.  The device is really "Fire".  When the snow fell - he warmed the bed before bedtime.  If you lie on the couch watching a movie by putting it on your knees and putting it on your belly - in half an hour, to the climax itself, you begin to feel the heat of passion with your whole body.  To the credit of the tablet, I can say that for all the time I have never been able to catch it by forcibly reducing the frequency of the processor due to overheating.  And if it is installed on the table as expected, then the problem of the hot back wall of the device will not worry you. <br><br><h5>  Charging </h5>  Charging device quickly.  Really fast.  That is, the charging speed of it is higher than the discharge rate and this distinguishes it favorably from some smartphones.  Very convenient - you can charge and work! <br><br><h5>  Pen </h5>  A lot of words have been said about the ‚Äúpen‚Äù, but in the positive part I would like to note that you would not want to, but it‚Äôs not realistic to miss this pen.  As soon as the pen tip is five to seven centimeters from the screen, the device catches it and draws a ‚Äúpoint‚Äù under it, which works like a ‚Äúmouseover‚Äù, and you can look at the ‚Äútitle‚Äù, say, at the input field.  Word immediately switches to writing, in general, no problems.  In this mode, the device stops responding to finger presses.  You can lean your palm on the screen when writing with a stylus and not be afraid to poke something.  Someone claims that the device looks too cheap for a tablet for a thousand green ... I pofik.  But you can buy it is not expensive if it breaks or children lose.  There is handwriting, but I only found English recognition.  The response speed is amazing.  It is seen that there is a slight delay, but this does not interfere at all when writing.  You can quite adequately take notes if you are having problems with typing.  Also on the stylus there is a button, used as PCM. <br><br><h5>  Form factor </h5>  The tablet is monolithic.  Holding smartphones in your hands you always somehow feel that there is a screen, there is a case, there is a cover that flies away and is lost when it falls.  Everything is made from different materials.  Surf in his hand is like a brick.  From dangling - only the stylus on the magnet is on the side.  The stand leans back in two positions and in no one play.  There is no fear that now it will "develop" or jump from one mode to another.  It's amazing how it was done without clips or latches.  Somewhere on the Internet there is a video with analysis, it says that much is glued inside.  Tactile, it seems as if it is flooded with lead through the ventilation slots.  Fully filled, to the eyeballs.  But about weight in the third part ... <br><br><h5>  Battery </h5>  Perhaps, the Achilles heel of the device.  I note that if you turn on the ‚Äúhibernation‚Äù of the device when you press the power button (and the default is ‚Äúsleep‚Äù), if you turn off the bluetooth, then for some reason the Surf is no longer so dependent on the outlet.  For the test, I launched the third heroes ... 5 hours is enough.  I can not imagine a case (it is now customary to replace the ‚Äúsituation‚Äù with the same fashionable word, yes?) In which I would have 6-7 hours to spy heroes without interruption for recharging.  Vaio showed approximately the same results. <br><br><h5>  Axis </h5>  About Windows I will not, so as not to holivarit.  I note only after installation, she asked me for a username and password from the account, and then offered to download the installation from any other device registered to this name, and ... did everything on the tablet just like on a laptop.  The same arrangement of tiles, system settings.  Even the screen saver on the desktop and the screen lock are copied.  Naturally, the office and stuff had to be put in handles. <br><br><h5>  Onedrive </h5>  Integrated into the system very deeply.  It does not interfere in the absence of the Internet (although it pushes a little when opening and saving, but this is not critical, because in return you get backup files + access directly from your other devices).  For most users, it will become just an inconspicuous gadget. <br><br><h5>  Keyboard </h5>  Praise Gates is sold separately.  For example, I don‚Äôt really want to stick another 120 g of a keyboard to a device weighing 900g, which will be eating my backlight with my own backlight.  And turn the tablet into another laptop and pay 130 green rubles for it.  Therefore, for a penny, I bought a wireless mini-clav battery-powered, and it lies in the semi-working place.  And I took the tablet at any time and went with it, say, to the kitchen.  In addition, during operation, you can keep the keyboard on your lap or anywhere in the table.  USB is engaged ... you say.  But ... you can buy a bluetooth keyboard, this time.  The keyboard is needed for large amounts of typed text, and not when watching videos from a flash drive - these are two.  The on-screen keyboard immediately comes in three options.  "Standard", "adaptive" and "under the thumbs" is not under the thick, namely under the big.  Two pieces on the edges of the screen. <br><br><h5>  Other </h5><br>  %  4300U.  1.9-2.5 GHz.  Hurray, what else can I say. <br>  USB3.  The flash drive sticks out in the device is extremely small.  It copies really fast, but it‚Äôs more convenient for me to change cards.  Buy several microSD at once, and life will become easier.  If you do not lose them =) <br>  Wifi  Very decent transmitter.  Catch the waffle where it should not be.  Does not lose connection and does not cause censures at all.  If you no longer have WiFi devices at home, switch the point to ‚Äún-only‚Äù mode.  Well, the battery is not childish. <br><br><h4>  Part Three, the dark side of the moon </h4><br><br><h5>  Power Supply </h5>  Comes with a removable wire (the one that plugs into the outlet) But this wire with two holes, and not like all computer with three.  I was lucky - the same power connector was on the camera.  The rest will have to buy a separate cord for the reserve.  If that - from a computer or monitor standard cable will not work.  In addition, there is a chance to buy this cord with a "flat" plug.  It makes sense to clarify this nuance in advance from the seller. <br><br><h5>  Pen </h5>  Fits into the power supply connector.  Yes, the connector is magnetic, and can hold either a power cord or a pen.  That is, you either charge the tablet and hold the pen in your hand, or ‚Äúplug‚Äù the power connector with the stylus.  About ... losing a pen in this situation is a matter of time.  Therefore, the pen is cheap.  Probably, Microsoft first wanted to make the tablet waterproof and it was a plug.  But then they installed batteries, fucked up the gap formed (about it below) and decided to make a stylus out of the plug, and call the slot itself ‚Äúventilation‚Äù.  The pen from the Vacum bamboo was not recognized, which is not surprising.  But I didn‚Äôt really try, I just poked it right after I bought it.  This stylus is two times thinner and therefore more comfortable and familiar.  Just an ordinary pencil in hand. <br><h5>  Form factor </h5>  If someone wants to try to hold the device in your hand before buying, and there is no one available for sale, go to the Tile shop.  Take in the left hand a ceramic tile for a bathroom 40 * 20.  Walk with her.  Look at the drawing.  Move your finger over it.  Feelings will be similar, working with a tablet on weight is almost impossible.  Theoretically, yes.  But practically - no.  A kilogram of mass is distributed in the device in such a way that it can be kept on weight only as a baby when feeding - putting the gadget on the forearm, so that the main weight falls on the shoulder, and the palm only holds Syurf horizontally.  But in any case, 40+ degrees of the back cover will not let you enjoy this process for very long.  If you want complete immersion, stick any handle from the nearest kiosk from the right end to the gum.  This is so that you do not create a false sense of ‚Äúwell, with two or two hands to keep the norms‚Äù. <br>  He is tall.  Or wide ... it is not clear how correct, but in his hand he looks more like a book than a notebook.  The surface is slippery.  On the one hand glass, on the other a metal wall.  Drop - with a half kick.  I wanted to tie a lanyard to him, but did not find what to hook. <br><br><h5>  Ventilation ... oh yeah baby </h5>  If you have at least something homely (cat, dog, hamster, child), Surf sucks up everything he gets.  I don‚Äôt know if he is collecting it for DNA analysis and sending it to the NSA or just like that, but ... Considering that he practically doesn‚Äôt understand it, establish connections in the nearest service with the compressor.  Otherwise, I can not imagine how to clean it. <br><br><h5>  Screen </h5>  The screen is wide.  The height of the screen is clearly not enough, and in every possible way I want to somehow fix it.  It is good that I have already got used to holding the "start" panel on the side.  On Syurf it really saves the day, otherwise nothing.  Sometimes the keyboard for entering the login that has opened on the floor of the screen shields a field for entering a password ... I did not find how to turn off the auto-tuning of the monitor brightness when the lighting changes. <div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">But they helped me</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/cagami/" class="user_link">cagami</a> : <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b0c/dc9/059/b0cdc9059354ac1bebf83766585a48f1.png"><br><br></div></div><br><br><h5>  Axis </h5>  I did not put ubunt.  Not all devices could recognize, so for now the eight.  A tablet without a wifa is a useless brick.  And this is a minus of the tablet, and not the Nix, because they might be puzzled by the drivers, and not spread the source of the Word! <br><br><h5>  Onedrive </h5>  Unlike the dropbox, which immediately shakes you locally everything that it has, and then it just downloads updates ... This infection does not shake anything until you ask.  And, as a rule, you begin to ask on a trip, when something is needed in a car on the road, but it is ‚Äúnot available offline.‚Äù  Be vigilant with this vile little animal. <br><br><h5>  Other </h5><br>  Icon "win" on the bottom of the case.  Not critical, but sometimes grabbing the tablet you press randomly ... since this is a button, it turns out. <br><br>  Camera nedomegapikseli.  On the one hand, this is shameful, on the other - less Skype traffic will be consumed, less charging is spent on image processing.  Seen really not very high quality ....  But the saddest thing is the trolls with the latest nokiyami. <br><br>  <b>USB</b> port is only one.  Although the seats are still under three nearby.  Pure water marketing.  Like the lack of a microphone jack. <br>  <b>4GB</b>  Well, Microsoft, well, ...! <br><br><h4>  Part Four - Impressive </h4><br><br>  Surf - for work.  Not for the consumption of content, but for its creation.  But for a comfortable creation, for an open office, or work in the country.  When it is possible to connect the tablet to the projector and sit with the keyboard in the chair.  At the table, I feel more comfortable working on a regular computer, when you can not soar your head about what and how much you opened and launched.  On departures in offices - for the laptop.  No, he does not lag.  But just by what I understand, you don‚Äôt have to open 100,500 programs on it.  Still, 4GB of RAM put an end.  Yes, this is a fast hibernation.  Yes, this is a little more free space, but this is not just a minus, this is a division into two, for me personally. <br>  If you are a student and want to take him to lectures - this is your choice.  Even in the most minimal configuration.  Having all the lectures and labs in one brick is the dream of any bot.  Again, you can merge cards from course to course or from stream to stream. <br>  If you work - the device will pay for itself somewhere in six months.  At least by the fact that I started to work where I used to, because of inconvenience.  The laptop is on its knees ... brrr ... and the little clave is quite self. <br>  If you learn languages ‚Äã‚Äãor read documents in foreign languages, it is not the easiest to read, but with the possibility of installing translators. <br>  If you are a housewife, a schoolboy, or earn money not on a computer, but, say, do a massage at home, or a staff, or are engaged in sales - buy an iPad, a Samsung with a stylus.  You will look more elegant with them and get real pleasure from using. <br><br>  In general, in the tablet you can feel the user setting for the purchase of gadgets after the purchase of the device.  Few yusb ports?  Buy a docking station.  Not enough disk space?  Buy a subscription to OneDrive.  Those 200 gigs that go in the box with Surf (there are two pieces of paper with codes next to the instruction) will end in two years.  There is a feeling of buying salty nuts in a brasserie.  Although of the necessary things to work really - only the keyboard and external monitor.  Do not break your eyesight if you take Surf for permanent work. <br><br>  It seems to have read the text twice, but for certain he missed something.  Squeeze in a personal typos and stylistic shoals, pliz.  Or ideas on the correct hub.  Or hint that this is not a technical article, and it does not belong here. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/218721/">https://habr.com/ru/post/218721/</a></p>
