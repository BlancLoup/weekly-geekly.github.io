  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Professional ethics and ‚Äúcoochackers‚Äù</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I am writing a post "on the topic of the day" - for yesterday a certain folk craftsman <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blog/startup/47052.html">found a hole</a> in the berspersons.ru aggregator.  Found - and behaved in the highest degree ugly.  Not only did he set up a bug in Habr√©, he also spammed users' accounts through a hole (even if he did not do it, but his followers, it was necessary to think before putting it into the public domain).  As a user of the service, I also came under the distribution, yes - I already cleared all the ‚Äúviral‚Äù messages from blogs, I change passwords everywhere right now ... and, as they say, I think a lot. <br><br>  When he was the programmer of the ‚Äúyouth portal‚Äù (read: kindergarten) <a href="http://zontik.ru/">http://zontik.ru, he</a> had to deal with such characters all the time.  For the site‚Äôs code is unusually leaky (and written, for the most part, not by me) - it‚Äôs not a secret to anyone that SQL-injections and XSSs were like holes in a colander, and now, surely, a lot remains .  And, given that the main contingent of this site were teenagers with all their inherent set of adolescent problems, such as the ego that was infringed - all these bugs were used only by them for the purpose of self-affirmation and settling accounts with enemies.  In general, I have seen video tutorials posted on the network ‚Äúhow to break an Umbrella‚Äù, and ‚Äújust like that‚Äù banned users, and messages on behalf of others, and even my own password, so I learned to set passes of 25 or more characters) .  And for each such find, essesna, blushing in front of the authorities, and even snatch up the lyuley.  And if I myself made all these mistakes, it would be at least not so offensive.  I would even know that I deserved it ... <br><br>  So what am I writing this for?  I don‚Äôt understand the hysterics, the universal hocking-hooting and the desire to ‚Äúlower‚Äù the service with all the forces, like ‚Äúoh, what they are all suckers, that's what they need, he himself retired and I wish everyone, burgaga‚Äù.  If this is the expression of the opinion of Habrapublic, then its level, alas, has fallen dramatically.  As correctly written in the comments, only the coder who writes nothing is not mistaken.  Well, or writes something like hellowworld on BASIC (c) me.  And all are so straight right that just a star.  Of course, it‚Äôs wise to talk about the prospects of multinational IT corporations (like ‚Äúif Microsoft Buys Microsoft so much‚Äù) or about the great and terrible FREELANCE (isn't it because they simply don‚Äôt take a permanent job?) Is a pleasant experience.  And when someone really does something, creates some useful services (at least BP is really useful to me) - you definitely need to ‚Äúdrop the upstart.‚Äù

      Know, than normal black hat differs from a kulkhatsker?  Black hat-ohm is driven by anything - the desire to earn extra money, the slogan ‚Äúinformation must be free‚Äù is just a sporting interest - but it is unlikely that it will be a desire to show off, to assert itself at the expense of others and to shout about yourself to the entire Network.  If only because with a good scale of hacking (and not just ‚Äúspamming someone else's blog‚Äù) it is simply not safe to glow once more.  And kulhacker (most often young) is exactly what the "you are all suckers trying to show, and I am a cool coder."  Perhaps I am too emotional - but I myself have always been wanted by this.  Found a hole, got a bonus with it - either use it yourself, or report back to the admin.  And to spread it in public, and even with similar comments - I think this is precisely a manifestation of bloated ChSV.  I would not like to give such hands to such people - I would have spat in a face when I was in person.  For I prefer to communicate with professionals, not with banderlog. <br><br>  PS Well, in support of the service (no, I do not pay for it) - <a title="ad-astra on the Internet" href="http://ad-astra.bestpersons.ru/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ae6/684/45a/ae668445a2c5193ce0a11ba04b8f3fa5.png"></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/29696/">https://habr.com/ru/post/29696/</a></p>
