  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Reflections on misunderstanding future perspectives</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  This morning, while reading this <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/187318/">article</a> , I involuntarily had a few thoughts that I would like to share. <br>  Now there is no scale projects, which was observed in the 60s.  Young people are no longer so inspired by the flights into space, now it has ceased to be something distant and unknown, all romance has left it.  Not that all, but its lion‚Äôs share - for sure.  And now there is a most interesting phenomenon - the youth has reached IT.  I do not know why it is there that pulls every single person.  Maybe someone is attracted by money, but I have a suspicion that the very ‚Äúromance of the unknown‚Äù that computers present - the freedom of endless creativity, ‚Äúlife in a dream‚Äù - when everything you do lives only with in your head  Perhaps I am idealizing, and perhaps I am not at all right.  But I think so. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  There is no visible scope that was in the twentieth century - people were eager for what they see and feel: into space, into the depths of the ocean, into the structure of the atom, they tried to increase the speed of movement, improve housing conditions, create something grand.  This is something that captured young and living minds, making them tremble.  After all, each person is laid out as much as possible only if he is really interested.  He does not need extra money, does not need fame and does not need recognition - he creates what completely captured his imagination, becoming an obsessive idea.  And if before these ideas were clear to everyone - people saw what was going on around and that something fundamental was being created, which one could, if not touch, then see for sure. <br>  And now (or rather, a little more than ten years ago) the moment has come that most ordinary people who once admired such people as Gagarin, stumbled upon a wall of misunderstanding.  They are not able (or unwilling) to understand what is happening in the IT world and what occupies the minds of young people who have come to this sphere.  I do not want and do not try to say that ordinary people are stupid.  No, not at all.  The only thing I want to convey is that they are different.  It is impossible for them to understand how an abstract text, highlighted in different colors, can turn into some kind of abstract structures that interact with each other, as whole complex systems grow into programmers' heads, divided into modules and functioning only in imagination.  Once someone from the habrovchan very well said: ‚ÄúDo not wake the programmer‚Äù and was completely right, because all our work is a dream that can be so easily dispelled if you distract a person. <br>  They say that humanity does not solve global problems, that we have dug and are marking time in one place.  But perhaps we are simply not aware of the width of our steps - after all, being on the verge of progress or, in other words, considering systems in too great an approximation, we are not able to realize how far we are going.  After half a century, it will be noticeable what this ‚Äúclapping on the spot‚Äù has achieved.  And now - we just can't notice it. <br>  See how beautiful space rockets or the splitting of an atom are - a triumph of engineering thought, which cannot but capture its beauty and breadth of thought.  Look at what was created in the twentieth century.  Each invention strikes with its beauty, both from the point of view of mathematics and from the point of view of its functional purposes. <br>  And now look at what has been done over the past 50 years, at modern technologies and at what will be ahead.  Think about how amazing and beautiful things were created by engineers in the "imaginary" world - every time I wonder how many abstractions and the number of mechanisms involved is behind entering the browser address habr.ru, starting from pressing keys on the keyboard (phone / tablet) and drawing characters on the screen, to the most complex system of turning text into bytes, which, in turn, into impulses and routing of these impulses.  I really involuntarily feel a thrill and enthuse that people were able to achieve this. <br>  Now it has become possible to dream in reality, and dreams, as you know, are very peculiar to young people.  And now the opportunity to create their own dreams with their own hands.  Previously, they discussed and calculated the trajectories along which the rocket would ideally bring down the enemy ship.  Now we have four days discussing how to make a dropbox for perfect user use. <br>  Did we shred or did the knowledge gained in the last 13 years of the new millennium spread us to a new, ‚Äúinvisible‚Äù side of science and progress? <br>  I think neither one nor the other, I think this is just a new round, which will bring many wonderful discoveries.  It's only the beginning. </div>
