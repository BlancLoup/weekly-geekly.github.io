  <section class="page js-page"><h1>I ask for help</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Dear Habrasoobschestvo. <br>  My topic is caused by the article <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/i_am_advertising/78757/">‚ÄúOperation Blow Up the Swamp‚Äù. ‚Äù</a> Under the cut are my rampant fantasies about informatization of education. <a name="habracut"></a><br>  Now I appeal to all those who are not indifferent to the fate of modern Russian education.  I do not know, maybe this is somewhat pretentious, but I consider the situation to be corrected.  And, in my opinion, all the prospects were formed for the solution of this problem: the crisis state of education, the technical possibility, and the political will of the supreme power. <br>  I work at the Republican Center for Further Education of Children.  And I see the situation in education firsthand.  Over the past 10 years, the level of education in fundamental subjects has dropped significantly.  But most importantly, the prestige of education has fallen.  Educational institutions have really turned into a stagnant swamp, where the only movement is squeezing out ‚Äúvoluntary‚Äù material assistance.  I think the situation should be changed, and I think I know how.  But I understood - this is beyond my abilities.  Therefore, I appeal to you for help. <br>  The idea lies, so to speak, in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe popular trend - the virtual provision of the state.  services.  After all, education is one of the services on a par with medicine and utilities provided by the state. <br>  My idea is that, on the basis of the Centers for Continuing Education, to form Internet portals coordinating the work of students.  And now I am ready to answer questions that you are ready to ask :) <br>  <b>Why additional education, and not schools?</b>  IMHO, the bet in the development should be done on enthusiastic children.  And such children are traditionally concentrated in circles and sections in additional education. <br>  <b>Why your center?</b>  I recently returned from a business trip to Rostov to the regional Center for scientific and technical creativity.  There were presented all the CNTs in the Southern Federal District.  I talked with people, looked at the level of presentations - our Center at the general level in the field of Information Technology looks very worthy.  2 computer classes (10 apple + 9 PC).  Author development programs teaching programming, but not stupid "mouse-cracking".  All departments are computerized.  In general, we are not hopeless. <br>  An important feature of the Center is the sum of contracts with universities for which we carry out targeted training.  Those competitions and contests in which we participate. <br>  <b>What do I want to get as a result?</b> <br>  The uniform informational methodical complex includes: <br><ul><li>  The Center's site is a static rarely adjustable part + calendar of events. </li><li>  Pages of the Olympiad and Contests. </li><li>  Blogs of teachers and students.  And both teachers and students of the Center itself, as well as ‚Äúguests‚Äù. </li><li>  Electronic portfolio of students and teachers. </li><li>  Distance learning system. </li><li>  The system of remote writing creative works (electronic office). </li><li>  Social network of graduates. </li><li>  Electronic document management system. </li><li>  Periodic electronic edition - electronic magazine + children's online newspaper. </li><li>  Experimental platform for the introduction of secondary vocational education in additional education. </li></ul><br>  <b>Where did you find these mushrooms?</b>  No, it's not about them.  Just working with children on creative projects develops unrestrained fantasy :) <br>  <b>What is our interest in participating in this project?</b>  This project is extremely relevant.  As it seems to me, the President made it clear that we will move along the path of further informatization of society.  i.e. If you manage to create a worthwhile product, you can really sell it. <br>  <b>And then why do you need us?</b>  <b>You, as already said, you are not an IT specialist.</b> <br>  In addition to technical work, you need to do a lot of work on the methodological support of the project.  All this is the pedagogical ‚Äúblah blah blah‚Äù of which modern work of the teacher consists.  Without this, it will be another "spherical horse in a vacuum" - like a school portal.  Ie, the project should be done on a live educational institution. <br>  <b>Good.</b>  <b>And what else you will have wishes for the project?</b> <br>  I would also like it to be written in Python.  I think this language has long been asking for our education. <br>  <b>P / S</b> <b><br></b>  <b>These are dreams!</b>  But actually the idea appeared almost a year ago.  But to do something on the basis of ready-made engines did not work.  The closest thing that came close to Drupal, but still, this is a stillborn version.  The design will not fly: ( <br>  If nothing happens, I'll probably start all over again.  Slowly himself.  I agree to any help.  But I am an amateur, but I want a professional product. <br>  I discussed the issue with the general - he gave the go-ahead.  If you need more people pull up. </div>
