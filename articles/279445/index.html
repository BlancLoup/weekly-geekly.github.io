This post is about how to make participation in the conference turned into a cool weekend in the city we love. <br><br>  We will not write about the program‚Äôs charms and speakers, but we‚Äôll tell you about the Yeltsin Center, the keyboard monument and constructivism.  We hope the post will be useful for those who are still wondering whether to go to him at DUMP.

Imagine that you arrive on Thursday evening (and you can also work halfway on Thursday), you are at the conference all Friday, after-party night, you can walk around the whole Saturday and half of Sunday and look at the city, on Sunday evening - home.  On Monday, full of impressions, you begin to implement new ideas at work. <br><br>  Now the points. <br><br><h4>  <b>What's in this year's DUMP program?</b> </h4><br>  Here is the <a href="http://dump-conf.ru/section/8/%3Futm_source%3Dnews%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_term%3Dhabr%26utm_content%3Dhabr%26utm_campaign%3Dhabr">program for</a> this year.  55 reports in the sections FrontTalks, Serverside, Mobile, Web-design, DevOps, Testing, Management.  It seems to us, it will be interesting and useful.  What do you think? <br><br> <a href="https://fotki.yandex.ru/next/users/it-people-ekb/album/480748/view/993770%3Fpage%3D12"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4af/aab/c2f/4afaabc2f05a294e0d2040b888874298.jpg" width="800" height="533" title="DUMP257.JPG" alt="DUMP257.JPG"></a> <br><br><h4>  <b>What to see in Yekaterinburg?</b> </h4><br><h5>  <b>1. Yeltsin Center</b> </h5><br>  The main cultural and social event of 2015 in Yekaterinburg is the opening of the Yeltsin Center.  Now this is a must-see place for all visitors.  And the center is not so much about Boris Nikolayevich, as about time, about the nineties: here are the wrappers of the first imported chocolates, and Dendy, and the poster of the film ‚ÄúIntergirl‚Äù and even the nuclear briefcase.  In addition to the main museum, the center has a gallery, an excellent bookstore ‚ÄúPiotrovsky‚Äù, a cafe ‚Äú1991‚Äù, and if you're lucky, you can even get on one of the lectures (you can follow the schedule <a href="http://yeltsin.ru/events/">here</a> ). <br><br>  But one museum will be enough for a couple of hours: interactive, modern, well thought out and realized.  There is no second such place in Russia right now. <br><br>  The museum is open from Tuesday to Sunday, from 10:00 to 21:00.  Ticket price - 200 rubles. <br><br> <a href="https://fotki.yandex.ru/next/users/it-people-ekb/album/169532/view/1325912"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f4b/ecc/0de/f4becc0de04d683bcb7ae9b4cc1e0264.png" width="524" height="601" title="Screenshot 2016-03-15 at 17.36.35.png" alt="  2016-03-15  17.36.35.png"></a> <br><h6>  <i>Liberty Hall in the Yeltsin Center</i> </h6><br><h5>  <b>2. Monument Keyboard</b> </h5><br>  The most interesting sight of the city.  The monument itself is a copy of a concrete keyboard at a scale of 30: 1.  Consists of 104 keys.  The monument is included in the route ‚ÄúThe <a href="http://www.ekbredline.ru/">Red Line of Yekaterinburg</a> ‚Äù, which runs through the line of 30 main cultural sites in the city center.  Be sure to visit all IT professionals :) <br><br> <a href="https://fotki.yandex.ru/next/users/it-people-ekb/album/169532/view/1325874"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/94e/25b/fb3/94e25bfb3fdd1d0af074ee04125e02b6.png" width="718" height="684" title="Screenshot 2016-03-15 at 17.13.53.png" alt="  2016-03-15  17.13.53.png"></a> <br><h6>  <i>Excursion for speakers and participants of the conference PyCon Russia 2015</i> </h6><br><h5>  <b>3. Observation deck at Vysotsky</b> </h5><br>  To see the whole city from a height is part of the program of any model tourist.  In Yekaterinburg, this can be done from the 52nd floor of the Vysotsky business center.  And, by the way, ‚ÄúVysotsky‚Äù is the tallest building not only in Yekaterinburg, but in all of Russia outside of Moscow. <br><br> <a href="https://fotki.yandex.ru/next/users/it-people-ekb/album/169532/view/1325913"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/032/947/246/032947246e2c86eb67231c0fc51dbcd3.png" width="598" height="600" title="Screenshot 2016-03-15 at 17.37.12.png" alt="  2016-03-15  17.37.12.png"></a> <br><h6>  <i>Beautiful views of Yekaterinburg are not visible, but Benjamin Peterson and Gael Voroko are visible - PyConRu-2015 speakers</i> </h6><br><h5>  <b>4. Europe-Asia</b> </h5><br>  In Yekaterinburg there is a unique opportunity to visit simultaneously in two parts of the world: one foot in Europe, the other in Asia.  Near the city there is a symbolic border with a pedestal, where you can go.  There are many versions of where this true border passes, dividing Europe and Asia, but we know which answer is correct :) <br><br> <a href="https://fotki.yandex.ru/next/users/it-people-ekb/album/169532/view/1326004"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6b9/015/5f0/6b90155f0e6a4a317b933a5440d21422.jpg" width="800" height="600" title="f03fed0f29683cea27e35ac1b45f12f2.jpg" alt="f03fed0f29683cea27e35ac1b45f12f2.jpg"></a> <br><br><h5>  <b>5. Constructivism is our all</b> </h5><br>  In Yekaterinburg, about 140 constructivist buildings, sometimes occupying entire neighborhoods.  Such concentration of monuments of Soviet constructivism, perhaps, you will not see anywhere else: the complex of the town of the Chekists, the First House of the City Council, the General Post Office, the house of Uralsnabtorg on Lenin Avenue, the sports complex Dynamo.  We even have a house-tractor and a sickle house (they can be clearly seen from the observation deck). <br><br>  Walk along the main street - Lenin Avenue - and see for yourself. <br><br> <a href="https://fotki.yandex.ru/next/users/it-people-ekb/album/169532/view/1325918"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fed/752/d4c/fed752d4cbd92d6c37dfa620346d551b.jpg" width="600" height="400" title="IMG_4158 (1) .jpg" alt="IMG_4158(1).jpg"></a> <br><br><h5>  <b>6. And yet</b> </h5><br>  The only Russian monument to The Beatles, the Temple on Blood (in its place in 1918, the last Russian emperor Nikolai II and his family were shot), a monument to Vladimir Vysotsky, a monument to radio inventor Alexander Popov, a monument to Michael Jackson and that's not all. <br><br><h4>  <b>How much is it?</b> </h4><br>  Let‚Äôs estimate how much will be spent on the trip. <br><br>  1) To come to Ekaterinburg, in fact, is not as expensive as it may seem.  For example, from Moscow to Yekaterinburg and back you can fly for 5,400 rubles (April 7 here, April 10, back). <br><br>  Chelyabinsk, Perm, Ufa, Kurgan - it‚Äôs more convenient for you by train or car (by the way, we can get you and countrymen together to cooperate, all of a sudden, someone has empty seats in the car). <br><br>  2) Accommodation: from 400 rubles to ... per day. <br><br>  If you are for the budget option, <a href="http://www.sky-hostel.ru/">here</a> , <a href="http://arthostels.ru/hostels/ekaterinburg/lenina/">here</a> and <a href="http://www.bbhostels.ru/">here are the</a> good hostels. <br><br>  The <a href="http://dump-conf.ru/">partner hotels</a> are listed on the conference site, if you say the code word ‚Äúdump2016‚Äù when booking, then the price for you will be much lower than on the site.  Each of the hotels has its own buns.  In the Ramada, for example, the room rate includes a visit to the pool, sauna and Turkish bath at the Ramada Royal SPA, and it is convenient to live in Angelo if you arrive late because it is connected to the airport by a corridor and you don‚Äôt have to go anywhere else. <br><br>  To the Expo (conference venue) we organize a free transfer from the center in the morning and back in the evening. <br><br>  3) The cost of a ticket to the conference - 5,000 rubles.  If the company pays for participation in the conference, the costs are significantly reduced. <br><br>  And for students there is a special price - 2500 rubles.  To get a discount, send a student scan to om@it-people.ru, in response we will send a code for registration. <br><br> <a href="https://fotki.yandex.ru/next/users/it-people-ekb/album/480748/view/993777%3Fpage%3D12"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/aa3/c83/15e/aa3c8315e6c3dc516c8bdfcf5284edff.jpg" width="800" height="533" title="DUMP264.JPG" alt="DUMP264.JPG"></a> <br><br><h4>  <b>How to get the most out of the conference?</b> </h4><br>  Spend time studying the program: identify the reports that interest you, study the speakers (perhaps they will be interesting not with this topic, but with some other), see the reports in the ‚Äúnot your‚Äù sections.  And there will be a lot of options to talk with the speaker and any interesting person: in the block of questions and answers, during breaks, on afterparty. <br><br>  We know that programmers are guys and they always take a responsible approach to attending conferences and choosing reports, so we suggest that you take part in creating a schedule so that you don‚Äôt have to break between the reports. <br><br>  In the <a href="https://conferra.org/Event/90e44b2b-97c0-437a-a0c5-3a1140dd835d/">conference</a> application <a href="https://conferra.org/Event/90e44b2b-97c0-437a-a0c5-3a1140dd835d/">,</a> mark the reports that are interesting to you, we will see where more participants want to go, much less, and depending on this we will make the most convenient schedule. <br><br><h4>  <b>Let's sum up</b> </h4><br>  It seems to us that a trip to the DUMP can be an excellent project ‚Äúhow interesting and to spend a weekend‚Äù: a conference, after-party, the best Russian museum about the nineties, a monument to the keyboard and other places of interest in Ekaterinburg. <br><br>  By the way, reports are not all that will be at the conference.  It so happened that the sponsors on DUMP always present themselves interesting and bright.  Let's open some secrets of this year: there will be a photo zone with crutches and bicycles from <a href="https://kontur.ru/">SKB Kontur</a> , an online quest from <a href="http://www.centre-it.com/">the IT Center</a> , slot machines from <a href="http://www.naumen.ru/">Naumen</a> and ... the seals are back! <br><br> <a href="https://fotki.yandex.ru/next/users/it-people-ekb/album/346598/view/638638%3Fpage%3D6"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/eb0/5a0/1c6/eb05a01c69b5deec12bda65f0f2a5a6a.jpg" width="800" height="533" title="IMG_7556.jpg" alt="IMG_7556.jpg"></a> <br><br>  <a href="http://dump-conf.ru/section/8/%3Futm_source%3Dnews%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_term%3Dhabr%26utm_content%3Dhabr%26utm_campaign%3Dhabr">Register</a> and come to Ekaterinburg.  We are good. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/279445/">https://habr.com/ru/post/279445/</a></p>
