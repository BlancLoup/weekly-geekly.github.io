      The founder and head of the coworking movement, Jelly in Austin, founded Conjunctured, a marketing and development company, along with four independent figures who met at the co-destructors in Austin. <br><br>  They created a joint company by inventing a new term co-company (from a collaborative company; does anyone have any idea how this abbreviation sounds in Russian?).  This allowed them to formalize their business and independently operate under a common brand. <br><br>  This model of business organization has evolved from the local coworker movement, known as Jelly, the largest network of independent coworkers in the world. <br><br>  From the very beginning, the creation of the co-company was discussed in an open Google group, encouraging interested readers to participate in the discussion.  The co-company will continue to be built as a transparent business model in which members of the organization and observers will be equally involved in development. <br><br>  The next step for Conjunctured will be the creation of a production environment based on membership in Austin and managed by the community. <br><br>  <strong>Manifesto</strong> <br><br>  1. Transparency.  Conjunctured members, customers and all who support this organization, are committed to being completely open to each other. <br>  2. Honesty.  No one should exploit the community for personal personal gain. <br>  3. Freedom of choice.  Participants themselves choose which projects they want and which they do not want to participate in. <br>  4. Communication.  Direct communication in any way that simplifies the workflow. <br>  5. Build human relationships.  The organization and its members should work on something that is irresistible for one person. <br>  6. Work is built on trust.  To make the community and its members do what they do best. <br>  7. Monitoring.  The community should identify participants who are not doing their job. <br>  8. Reviewing.  The co-company members criticize and evaluate each other‚Äôs work in an open forum. <br>  9. Free working time.  Participants can spend 5 minutes or 200 hours on work and rest.  In any case, whoever works more, he rests more. <br>  10. Granular workload.  All work should be distributed throughout the community. <br>  11. Financial sustainability.  The company and its members must make money. <br><br>  <strong>Opinions</strong> <br><br>  ‚ÄúInstead of working for someone else, I myself choose what to advertise and how.‚Äù Caesar Torres, co-founder of Conjunctured. <br><br>  ‚ÄúAs an entrepreneur, I have a natural need to try and bring everything to the end myself.  The co-company model I created allows independent entrepreneurs like me to help each other in our respective projects. ‚ÄùDavid H. Walker, co-founder of Conjunctured. <br><br>  ‚ÄúI like being part of the newest research center in Austin.‚Äù John Eric Metcalf, co-founder of Conjunctured. <br><br>  ‚ÄúYour guys have something others haven't seen.‚Äù Kevin Coim, head of Enterprise Teaming. <br><br>  ‚ÄúAustin, remaining Austin, is going to do everything in its own way.‚Äù Butcher, <a href="http://notanmba.com/">notanmba.com</a> . <br><br>  "What can I say, this is wonderful!".
