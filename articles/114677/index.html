  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Something about the specifics of the freelancer's relationship with others</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Here we will not talk about the relationship of freelancers and tax, with the customer, about self-organization as such.  Here you will see thoughts about the communication of a remote employee with other people and everything that follows from this. <br><br>  When a person has an entry in the workbook and an 8-12-hour working day to workload, all questions about his capacity somehow disappear by themselves.  Well, he works, well done.  Every month brings a fixed amount of money home.  Plus or minus is not considered, the basis is still the salary, as a rule. <br><br>  There is a reverse situation when a person is a freelancer.  Earns, as necessary.  Someone more stable, someone less.  But the bottom line is that he is constantly in good shape, always looking for new customers and has no bosses and a fixed working day.  And the freelancer does not have an employment record (sometimes, he doesn‚Äôt have the book itself) and any evidence of his financial viability.  This inevitably creates some problems in communicating with relatives and generally positioning oneself in society.  Let's say this communication is specific in its own way. <a name="habracut"></a>

      Our society is not accustomed to such kind of activity as freelancing.  It would seem a paradox - because more and more freelancers every day.  However, the essence does not change.  If we respect the freelancer in the West, here he is perceived as a bummer and a freeloader.  Again, the paradox, because work remotely implies payment for the fact of the work done.  Worked more - earned more.  Not everyone understands this, but you need to communicate with these non-understanding people and even live under the same roof. <br><br>  It just so happened that I was married.  My wife is conservative, despite her youth.  And it is hard for her to get used to the idea that if I am sitting at home, this does not mean that I do not work.  Even direct evidence ‚Äî money ‚Äî does not change her mind.  Say, you never know how much you will earn and by what time.  I think the situation is familiar to many. <br>  The surest decision is to ignore any comments on this issue and do what you yourself consider necessary.  We are free people?  Immediately I warn you: be prepared for a spoiled relationship with your loved ones, because they believe that they are right, and you don‚Äôt listen to their opinion.  But this is not a very big price for its formation and development in the world of freelancing.  After all, the main thing is your goals, aspirations.  It is on the realization of their own goals in life that the well-being of the family depends, just as personal happiness contributes to family happiness. <br><br>  If you follow the above advice, you will definitely have to prove everything by deed.  And then you really need to achieve your goals, because you have taken responsibility.  And to be responsible for your actions in front of your close ones is, perhaps, a stronger motivation than the fear of superiors.  Personally, I even had to somehow argue with a friend that I could earn a certain amount in a month.  If you like to communicate and have a lot of friends and relatives, such a bet you can not avoid. <br><br>  You can go the other way.  Say, you yourself or your husband / wife can make a plan for you with strong points, where it will be indicated by what time what amount and what will need to be earned.  Believe it helps.  When there are clear goals, it works much easier.  Moreover, it turns out that both spouses are involved in this case and act together.  What is called, and the wolves are fed and the sheep are safe. <br><br>  The most interesting thing is communication with older relatives, especially with parents or grandparents.  They are experienced and can give advice.  True, their advice often comes down to the fact that they say, you need to officially get settled and earn experience, otherwise there will be no pension.  I already wrote about ignoring, but they can be offended.  If peers are easily withdrawn, then the problem of fathers and children lasts a lifetime.  We live in a new world where other laws apply.  And this is better to reduce their communication on the topic of freelancing with seniors.  It is better not to go into details - all the same, many mothers-grandmothers will miss everything, because they will understand little or will not listen anyway, because, they say, they are experienced and wise, and we are young and stupid.  This is already laid on the subconscious. <br>  I will make a reservation: not all people of the older generations remain in the old world, this is only a trend. <br><br>  And finally, what to do with everyone else?  Everyone will get tired of explaining the essence of our work, therefore, we can limit ourselves to specifying the specifics of our activities, adding that you are an entrepreneur.  But this is the case.  A freelancer is an entrepreneur, it's just that his activities are often not registered with the authorities.  By the way, what's stopping you from registering your business?  Immediately, a lot of questions from others will disappear, because you can show documents to especially unbelievers.  Yes, and transfer to the Pension Fund to do.  However, everywhere there are pros and cons.  And to open a business or not - you decide.  But as they say, that's another story. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/114677/">https://habr.com/ru/post/114677/</a></p>
