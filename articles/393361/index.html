As one of the main selection criteria, it was possible to carry in a bag not only a sports uniform, but also at least a tablet, and even better, an ultrabook.  On <a href="https://geektimes.ru/">Geektimes</a> there are a couple of articles about choosing a backpack for a geek ( <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/medgadgets/blog/245626/">1</a> and <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/airbnb/blog/245240/">2</a> ).  And <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/shopozzcom/blog/236953/">one</a> was even found on <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/">Habrahabr</a> .  But I just needed a sports bag, and therefore, having discovered the <a href="https://www.google.ru/">great and terrible,</a> I began to search. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  <b>First mistakes and getting on the right track</b> </h4><br>  At first I began to conduct my search by entering the phrase " <i><b>sport bag</b></i> " in the search field.  However, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/">Amazon</a> immediately told me that the <b><i>gym bag</i></b> would be right.  Walking through a couple of pages, I realized that the sample should be narrowed down, and asked the search <b><i>term</i></b> " <b><i>gym bag tablet</i></b> ".  Although the sample began to look like what I needed, it was still not that.  As a result of several more experiments, it was found that the query " <b><i>gym bag with tablet pocket</i></b> " was ideal. <br><br><h4>  <b>First hope</b> </h4><br>  The first lack of business (this is more likely a backpack), to which I noticed was the <a href="http://www.aersf.com/duffel-pack-00001/"><b>Aer Duffel Pack</b></a> . <br>  I found even a good review of it: <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/4ahbJIJW-Mg%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700043,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhiQSriPXZ8NJf4_w1p71bMuSkL03A" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  It quickly turned out that this bag is the result of a <b>sturt-up</b> and running on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/aersf/aer-duffel-pack-the-gym-bag-for-the-modern-lifesty"><b>Kickstarter</b></a> and buying it in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia"><b>Default Country is</b></a> very problematic.  I did not want to wait for the delivery (if it is). <br><br><h4>  <b>Deepening in literature</b> </h4><br>  After studying a few more such instances, such as <a href="http://www.dsptch.com/collections/packs/products/gym-work-bag-black">this</a> bag from a firm with the unpronounceable name <b>DSPTCH</b> (if this name is derived from the word <b>Dispatch</b> , then perhaps the company began with a form for postmen), I sat down to read articles like <a href="http://www.fitnessvote.com/best-gym-bag/"><b>Best Gym Bag</b></a> and <a href="http://hiconsumption.com/2015/04/best-gym-bags-for-men/"><b>Best Gym Bags for Men</b></a> .  They prompted me to the idea that perhaps you do not need to look for something unique, but it is worth contacting eminent manufacturers of sports accessories.  Having studied the range of three manufacturers, I settled on <a href="http://www.reebok.ru/sportivnaia-sumka/AJ6802.html">this</a> bag which I purchased.

    <h4>  <b>Exit winner</b> </h4><br>  Photos, unfortunately, I did not have time to do (and I don‚Äôt have a suitable place for this), and therefore I will describe all the advantages of this model from the photo from the official site. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7dd/6fb/cbf/7dd6fbcbf1435a043c851e947460bab3.jpg" alt="front" align="left" width="350"><ul><li>  On the right is a shoe compartment.  Honestly, for the eight years that have passed since I bought the previous bag, I was not interested in this type of accessories, and for me it was a discovery, the presence of such a special department.  It is very convenient and practical: you no longer need to shove shoes into the bag and dry at home, it may well dry up during the journey to the house. </li><li>  A small fiber lined compartment is located at the front.  Wearing a phone there is not safe, but for sunglasses - just right. </li><li>  The main branch opens from the top.  The flap consists of two zip-sealed parts with neoprene.  This is the laptop compartment.  <b>13</b> 'there go with a bang, for <b>15</b> ' check, unfortunately, I can not. </li><li>  Two straps allow you to carry your bag as a backpack.  In this case, the compartment with the laptop is pressed to the back and protected from penetration from the outside.  The only thing is that the straps have to be moved aside so that it is convenient to handle the contents of the bag. </li></ul><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/dd2/c4c/b0e/dd2c4cb0e4c6979d799d71dc9f57dff9.jpg" alt="back" align="right" width="350"><ul><li>  From the second end is a pen.  For it is convenient to hold the bag, for example, in public transport, when a lot of people and the vertical location of baggage is preferable. </li><li>  Why do I need a Velcro badge? It remains a mystery to me! </li><li>  Inside there are two mesh compartments.  I adapted one for bandages, and in the second I put flash drives and charging. </li><li>  The most interesting!  Inside there is a compartment covered with insulating material like a refrigerator in a bag.  A lot of things do not fit there, but a half-liter bottle of water is easy. </li></ul><br>  The bag costs quite reasonable money.  Everything is done soundly: the seams do not diverge anywhere, the central zipper looks for centuries.  Handles for carrying the hand do not cut, carry a bag as a backpack is also convenient. <br><br><h4>  <b>Results</b> </h4><br>  She is very pleased with the bag, although she has not yet passed the field tests.  Perhaps some in mind have other worthy specimens.  I would be glad if my article will help at least someone who is in a similar situation with my situation. <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/393361/">https://habr.com/ru/post/393361/</a></p>
