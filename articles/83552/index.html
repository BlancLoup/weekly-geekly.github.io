  <section class="page js-page"><h1>We optimize working time, experiment</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  After reading the article ‚Äú <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/arbeit/82641/">Sleep a little, but right?</a>  "Imbued with the theme.  I am very grateful to the author.  He did not say anything new, but he gathered everything together and correctly picked up the words to bring them to the public. <br>  I agree with the author about coffee, cigarettes and energy drinks.  I never had a passion for power engineers, smoked 1 time in my life and quit after 10 seconds, and even so took a sip of coffee, burned my lip and hawked a nasty taste during the day.  However, the stumbling block to the ‚Äútoday‚Äù for me was not only alcohol, as for the author, but also the regime.  The last 6 years I have been working in a permanent job for periods.  When because of money, when because of boredom.  My main income has always remained remote, hence the downtime schedule. <br><br>  Ps The system provides for the registration of time, and not a decrease in sleep.  More precisely, a time tracking system for people with a downed work schedule.  Before you write a comment - read the post. <br>  pps The time of "rash" for each person is unique, do not believe in tales of 3, 6 or 8 hours.  There is an average number, but in general it is unique.  Someone from the great slept for 4 hours, someone for 10, but that did not stop them from being great =) <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Previously, several times planned to draw up a daily routine, as in lower grades, and follow it.  However, it was literally lost on the first draft.  It is easier to work 36 hours and complete the logical domain in one sitting, than to try to remember what and where in the morning.  Impressed by the article of the author, and then heaps of articles on Wikipedia and open NIs, I went to bed and noticed that I had lost my watch on my cell phone.  It was too lazy to go to the company, and then it dawned on me: ‚ÄúWhy not put the clock on the phone at 00:00?‚Äù.  I have problems with insomnia as soon as I started working for myself.  In fact, you go to sleep when you turn it off, you fall asleep quickly.  Therefore, it is enough just to put the clock at 00:00 before bedtime, the alarm at 06:00 and lie down.  During the day I have other time sources on my computer, desktop clock, PDA, etc.  And also my own hours.  At the moment, at 02:56 Moscow time, my watch shows 21:04.  I understand that people living under the regime will not understand me.  But I can firmly say by my watch that in 3 hours I will be quite vigorous.  At any time during the day, I can look at my ‚Äúown‚Äù hours and evaluate my capabilities and costs for this or that work. <br>  I live on this scheme for the third day, not much.  It should be noted that at one time I tried to reduce sleep to a minimum, used a bunch of techniques or tried to use them, and 100% of them did not take root.  In this case, although I like this technique, I cannot be subjective, because  I invented it for myself (I am sure that not only did I get to this, but I have never seen anything like this before), but the fact is that it doesn‚Äôt bother me the way it was with others. <br>  Of course, it is too early to talk about its effectiveness or inefficiency, but if anyone is interested, I advise you to try.  If I suddenly jump off this technique, find a flaw or immerse myself completely in it, I‚Äôll let you know =) The feedback is very interesting. </div>
