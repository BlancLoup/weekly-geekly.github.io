For this purpose, reports on the global network of arms dealers will be used. <br>  00:10 We will show how territorial, temporal, social, and some other analyzes can answer intelligence questions about this network. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d69/369/f93/d69369f9392e450c932d4aa421679350.jpg"><br><br>  00:17 These icons on the graph represent about a hundred reports from our investigation. <br>  00:25 ‚ÄúText Cloud‚Äù (textcloud) will help us identify keywords from these reports. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e4b/5d3/a01/e4b5d3a018434115b985055259e65931.jpg"><br><br>  00:28 Some terms appear: gun, barrel, buy, Karachi, Pakistan, and so on - which suggests that this network is connected to the Middle East and South Asia. <br>  00:37 Let's transfer these documents to the card. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cc3/fa0/5e1/cc3fa05e14e140f0a40b26c2b0a8e56c.jpg"><br><br>  00:42 Documents were distributed according to the geographical names indicated in them.  We can also use the Timeline here to view the location of documents by creation date. <br>  00:50 Now let's clear the map and look for documents from Pakistan, one of the most popular text cloud results. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/000/a39/56b/000a3956bb2448e5bbaac18f41a5e5ae.jpg"><br><br>  00:57 This search brings a number of documents, let's see them through the browser. <br>  01:01 In the browser, an analyst can structure information by assigning tags to it.  Let's highlight Malona Hag Bukhari. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/284/629/785/284629785484462eb2848c09d4f7e02f.jpg"><br><br>  01:10 Palantir automatically searches for objects that are already in the database, we can also create a new object, and select special properties for it to assign the tag appropriately. <br>  01:19 The blue line below the text shows an entity to which we just assigned a tag. <br>  01:23 Double clicking on a tag opens a complete file of the object, its properties, associated media files, the history of the object and a list of all data sources. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/453/bed/10e/453bed10e9cd43ce979352923d954bb4.jpg"><br><br>  01:35 To create links between objects with tags in the text, we simply drag one onto another, and then select the resulting connection with special properties. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/df4/880/679/df4880679584499fad125a52e5abefee.jpg"><br><br>  01:45 In a fully tagged document, color and lines indicate links to existing entities, events, and relationships. <br>  01:51 Now let's add the data we structured in the documents related to Pakistan to the graph. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ca0/bff/bd5/ca0bffbd5a884befb1ad017d4c2ed95b.jpg"><br><br>  01:57 On the graph, the analyst uses various tools to analyze data. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8b5/0ad/46f/8b50ad46fd41491993569a657f11bc1a.jpg"><br><br>  02:00 Here entities and events from Pakistan tags.  Using the histogram, we filled the graph with people, and the analyst can now use the tool for finding relationships between entities that can manifest from documents tagged by other analysts from our company. <br>  02:17 After constructing a graph of key entities and events of the Pakistani network, we can use the timeline to understand the temporal aspects of network activity, which include flights, meetings, payments, and the like. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/058/9db/e1c/0589dbe1cf00407a9d2ad44c8197fdbf.jpg"><br><br>  02:30 The analyst can also share the graph with other analysts of the company, here we can see shared graphs from Pakistan, Latin America and Dubai. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/50f/b5f/fed/50fb5ffed6ea474d929732717044645d.jpg"><br><br>  02:40 Let's look at the graph of the world network of arms dealers, which includes the entities and connections from all the tags of documents assigned by our team. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/72b/02d/c3b/72b02dc3bed24971b44a32531aee344e.jpg"><br><br>  02:49 We use a social networking assistant to identify key points for future investigations on our worldwide network. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2f6/287/beb/2f6287beb90446f8bbb99834a4ec96d9.jpg"><br><br>  02:56 Let's add a highlight color.  Now we see that Dubai, Bukhari, and Dombrowski are important intersection points on this network. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d5d/67d/851/d5d67d851fc246bbae55e27b3f9df769.jpg"><br><br>  03:03 By dragging all this onto the map, we can see all network activity geographically and in time if we use the Timeline. <br>  03:10 It gives a broad look at when and where each cell acts. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8c1/054/01c/8c105401cb334b6ab4f8cadb970a308e.jpg"><br><br>  03:15 For example, the UAE plays an important role, many of our goals met here in April. <br>  03:21 By structuring data from unstructured reports and using Palantir data analysis tools to achieve a goal, our team has made a clear display of the arms trade network in several countries and indicated the place where the network managers negotiated. <br><br><h4>  VAST 2010 Challenge, Pt.  2 </h4><br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/QMPQrRvLhaY%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhVq1RKKA_OLPIUNSmtJwiLzIIexQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Hospitalization records: Characteristics of the spread of the pandemic. <br><br>  00:00 This presentation will show how we use the Horizon analysis at Palantir to analyze the spread of the virus during a national pandemic. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c75/cda/1f0/c75cda1f02544eed88451e9b51dbc8d5.jpg"><br><br>  00:05 Horizon is designed for analyzing large amounts of data and will now be used to quickly visualize and analyze fifteen million records of hospital visits and three hundred and fifty-seven thousand death records.  Baseline data was divided by symptoms and entered into the system. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fb4/451/1c1/fb44511c1965446f8d7d962bd15c924d.jpg"><br>  It is written: "Horizon" is designed for analysis on two screens.  The video will switch between the analysis tree window and the visualization window. <br><br>  00:20 Please note that the time to process requests is not included in the video. <br>  00:23 Let's start by looking at a few basic histograms to get a general view of the data. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/438/d29/076/438d290764f64009af647c3725660d2a.jpg"><br><br>  00:27 This is a bar chart of hospitalization by age, which gives an almost perfect distribution chart with a peak at forty-four years. <br>  00:33 This is not normal, as we expected more visits to the hospital before the age of forty, based on data on the typical distribution by age and state of health. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2a9/bb9/d6b/2a9bb9d6b4394756996e77fbb1f9a9df.jpg"><br><br>  0:43 Now we use a batch histogram of visits to the hospital for patients who later died to determine the symptoms that most often led to death. <br>  00:53 Tremor and hearing loss, as an example of the symptoms associated with death. <br>  00:56 To investigate the temporal patterns of the disease, create a histogram of visits to the hospital by day, filter by death, and create another histogram of deaths by dates. <br>  01:12 There is a slight increase in the number of hits in May, and at the same time the number of deaths has increased. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ad6/fac/647/ad6fac64771e434f8ebda98c647e0613.jpg"><br><br>  01:22 In order to identify the temporary patterns of the disease, it will be useful to know how much time elapsed between the time of hospitalization and death. <br>  01:29 We can do this by adding a new property that finds the difference between the date of death and the date of treatment. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6a0/311/78d/6a031178dd5341dbb715c5725c6f3dee.jpg"><br><br>  01:38 We can now create a histogram with this new property.  It shows that almost all deaths occurred on the eighth day after hospitalization, which, hypothetically, could be a characteristic of a pandemic virus. <br>  01:51 By focusing on these deaths, we can create a histogram of the most common symptoms. <br>  01:58 Vomiting and abdominal pain are the most popular results. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cee/64d/919/cee64d91959e4a5282768020ef8c66e2.jpg"><br><br>  02:05 Let's use a heat map to see which geographic areas have the most fatal outcomes. <br>  02:12 In Pakistan, there are many deaths, while in Thailand and Turkey there are relatively few. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8a6/345/cb1/8a6345cb1677468e80189b3abb9acf02.jpg"><br><br>  02:20 Let's create a scattergram of days and places, which will give an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe intensity of the disease over time. <br>  02:34 We can see that the number of deaths in Thailand and Turkey is constantly low, while in other places the death rate peaks and decreases. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/92a/396/51a/92a39651aa38465885611a9cb0416722.jpg"><br><br>  02:45 By comparing the resulting graph with the histogram of the distribution of deaths by dates, we can understand when the pandemic began. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8ed/d84/73a/8edd8473a6564c8383506a0bd8eb9d88.jpg"><br><br>  02:57 With this new subset, we can create a new scatterplot for hospitalization to see how the disease has spread over time across the locality. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c71/625/c89/c71625c897844b9b8bd8d7652fd899b9.jpg"><br><br>  03:07 We see that Kenya, Pakistan and Syria are the countries with the earliest outbreaks of the disease. <br>  03:15 For more accurate information about the distribution of the disease in time and place, we can refer to the data on deaths in each territory. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8a0/572/776/8a0572776ace412e97ef2b833bb40447.jpg"><br><br>  03:25 By selecting data for Pakistan, for example, we can create a histogram of hospitalizations by date from a subset of patients who we suspect have died from a pandemic. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/452/da6/2f2/452da62f2bd34bc7b9b7a73a539167fe.jpg"><br><br>  03:38 Using the Palantir Horizon, we were able to quickly import, analyze and visualize pandemic data, identify anomalies and characterize the nature and development over time of this disease. <br><br>  <b>More about Palantir:</b> <br><ul><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/edison/blog/280434/">Palantir and money laundering</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/262837/">Palantir, PayPal Mafia, special services, world government</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/271883/">Palantir 101.
