  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Rolls-Royce among scooters - Ninebot KickScooter ES4 by Segway</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In this review, someone will discover a great electric scooter, someone will think, ‚Äú <i>Oh, they write about my scooter, I read it!‚Äù</i>  ", Someone will ask in the comments" <i>What are you just now talking about him?</i>  <i>He is no longer new, and January is outside</i> . ‚Äù  Yes, not new, yes, January, but yesterday was New Year's Eve, and today is already the middle of January - you will not notice how the asphalt becomes dry again.  Therefore, welcome to the cat - there is an overview of the most powerful version of the scooter Ninebot ES series. <br><br> <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/gearbest/blog/435656/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ae4/a79/810/ae4a79810252171e6b53a341388562e8.jpg"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Immediately a small blot about the title.  We all know Rolls-Royce cars primarily as rare, very expensive and comfortable cars, but a priori it is difficult to call a scooter a comfortable means of transportation.  But when this scooter first appeared on the playground of one small town near Moscow, one grandfather walking with a child could not hide his amazement and called the scooter that way :) I remember and liked it. <br><br>  And one more blot, rather even the necessary introductory, which could not find another place in the article.  This scooter in stores and the Internet can be found under different names - Ninebot ES2 or ES4, Ninebot KickScooter ES2 (or ES4), Ninebot ES2 by Segway, and in some places even write that this is Xiaomi.  And the thing is.  Segway Inc.  you all know - surely each of you had a chance at least once in your life to ride on their main product of the same name.  And it so happened that in 2015, the company filed a lawsuit against Ninebot (a Chinese manufacturer of hoverboard), who used similar technologies in their products (and they were patented by Segway).  The patent war soon ended with the fact that Ninebot simply bought the entire claimant company (with all its 400+ patents), which allowed solid pumping and taking an advantageous position in the market.  Well, Xiaomi (and several funds) gave the money for this purchase, so it‚Äôs already difficult to figure out who the dad is: Xiaomi, Ninebot or Segway.  Correctly we consider to call as written on the package - Ninebot Kickscooter.  The exact name of the model is ES2 (with ES4 now we will also figure it out), and ‚Äúby Segway‚Äù is rather just a marketing line, mentioning a more well-known brand in the spirit of ‚ÄúFrom the creators of the movie Titanic‚Äù.

      There are three models of the Ninebot KickScooter ES series on the market - this is the first (ES1), the second (ES2) and, as you might have guessed, the fourth (ES4) :) Functionally, they have a lot in common, outwardly they look almost the same - only the fourth model (due to an additional external battery), which is obtained by adding an external battery to the ES2 model.  But there are some minor differences.  And in order to immediately understand them, take a look at the summary table of characteristics. <br><br><h2>  Ninebot KickScooter ES Technical Specifications </h2><br><table><tbody><tr><td></td><td></td><th>  Ninebot ES1 <br></th><th>  Ninebot ES2 <br></th><th>  Ninebot ES4 <br></th></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">  Dimensions <br>  (L √ó W √ó D) </td><td>  Folded </td><td colspan="3">  113 √ó 43 √ó 40 cm </td></tr><tr><td>  Unfolded <br></td><td colspan="3">  102 √ó 43 √ó 113 cm <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Weight <br></td><td>  Net <br></td><td>  <font color="green">11.3 kg</font> <br></td><td>  <font color="orange">12.5 kg</font> <br></td><td>  <font color="red">14 kg</font> <br></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="3">  Rider <br></td><td>  Load capacity <br></td><td colspan="3">  25 - 100 kg <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Recommended age <br></td><td colspan="3">  14+ years <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Required height <br></td><td colspan="3">  120 - 200 cm <br></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="7">  Device parameters <br></td><td>  Max speed <br></td><td>  <font color="red">20 km / h</font> <br></td><td>  <font color="orange">25 km / h</font> <br></td><td>  <font color="green">30 km / h</font> <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Power reserve * <br></td><td>  <font color="orange">25 km</font> <br></td><td>  <font color="orange">25 km</font> <br></td><td>  <font color="green">45 km</font> <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Maximum slope <br></td><td>  <font color="orange">ten%</font> <br></td><td>  <font color="orange">ten%</font> <br></td><td>  <font color="green">15%</font> <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Types of surfaces designed to ride <br></td><td colspan="3">  asphalt, flat surfaces, obstacles up to 1 cm, slots and gaps up to 3 cm <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Working temperature <br></td><td colspan="3">  -10 - + 40 ¬∞ C <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Storage temperature <br></td><td colspan="3">  -20 - + 50 ¬∞ C <br></td></tr><tr><td>  IP rating <br></td><td colspan="3">  IP54 <br></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="6">  Battery <br></td><td>  Rated voltage <br></td><td colspan="3">  36VDC <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Maximum charging voltage <br></td><td colspan="3">  42VDC <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Charging temperature <br></td><td colspan="3">  0-40 ¬∞ C <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Rated power <br></td><td>  <font color="orange">187 Wh</font> <br></td><td>  <font color="orange">187 Wh</font> <br></td><td>  <font color="green">374 Wh</font> <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Battery management systems <br></td><td colspan="3">  overheating, short circuit, overcurrent and overcharge protection <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Number of batteries <br></td><td>  one <br></td><td>  one <br></td><td>  2 <br></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">  Motor <br></td><td>  Rated power <br></td><td>  <font color="orange">250 W</font> <br></td><td>  <font color="green">300 W</font> <br></td><td>  <font color="green">300 W</font> <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Maximum power <br></td><td>  <font color="red">500 watts</font> <br></td><td>  <font color="orange">700 W</font> <br></td><td>  <font color="green">800 W</font> <br></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="5"> Charger <br></td><td>  output power <br></td><td colspan="3">  71 W <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Input voltage <br></td><td colspan="3">  100-240 VAC <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Output voltage <br></td><td colspan="3">  42 VDC <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Output current <br></td><td colspan="3">  1.7 A <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Dhtvz charging <br></td><td>  <font color="green">3.5 hours</font> <br></td><td>  <font color="green">3.5 hours</font> <br></td><td>  <font color="red">7 h</font> <br></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="8">  Special features <br></td><td>  Frame material <br></td><td colspan="3">  Aluminum <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Wheels <br></td><td colspan="3">  8 ", with airless polyurethane rubber <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Shock absorber <br></td><td>  Front <br></td><td colspan="2">  Front and back <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Brake <br></td><td colspan="3">  Electric with E-ABS and foot <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Headlight <br></td><td>  Missing <br></td><td colspan="2">  LED (1.5 W) <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Stop signal <br></td><td>  Reflector <br></td><td colspan="2">  LED taillight <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Backlight <br></td><td>  Not <br></td><td colspan="2">  Custom color <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Driving modes <br></td><td colspan="3">  Economical, standard and sporty </td></tr></tbody></table>  <i>* Tested at full load (weight 75 kg), temperature 25 ¬∞ C, 60% of maximum speed on an average sidewalk.</i> <br><br>  The table above is very similar to the unique case: on a small plate, the manufacturer has combined the characteristics of all modifications and indicated almost all possible (more precisely, necessary) information about them - including details of which vacuum in which the power reserve was measured.  Respect <br><br>  According to the characteristics (load capacity and height) the scooter is suitable for both children and adults, but the weight, to put it mildly, is not for children.  And the dimensions - they are a little more than the usual scooter. <br><br>  <i>Interestingly, what's in the box ... even if the drum set.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/02f/908/7f5/02f9087f5ca642a7adb559b077512639.jpg"><br><br><h2>  Unpacking </h2><br>  If you are a pessimist, then the device comes in a semi-disassembled state, and if an optimist, then in a semi-assembled state. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/13f/daf/b3b/13fdafb3bbcc2316c3ef8ff1fee33e02.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4c1/3e7/5cd/4c13e75cd73e777cc8d6bcb438e0f090.jpg"><br><br>  Inside a half-ton box of shipping carton, which is laid out neatly: <br><br><ul><li>  Himself electric scooter (while it is more correct to call it a frame) </li><li>  Steering wheel (to be connected to the frame) </li><li>  Papers: user manual, quick start and warranty </li><li>  Charger </li><li>  Trivia: 5 M4 screws (for fastening the steering wheel) and a hex key for them </li></ul><br>  An optional external battery can be supplied - in this case, ES2 will turn into an elegant ES4.  In my case, the battery was an additional option - because if you ride, then all the money? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/21f/eb1/a2b/21feb1a2bc05989465025a096a4345c6.jpg"><br><br>  For full ammunition there is not enough helmet, but even before the new year it would be too naive to wait for it in the box, and that‚Äôs all individually.  So the complete set is quite self-sufficient, even the spare screw was carefully laid. <br><br><h2>  What is useful in the instructions </h2><br>  Included with the Ninebot ES4 is a small (in the size of a box from under a CD) instruction in various languages, among which Russian is also available.  20 pages of text (each language takes up so much) are divided into 15 sections - all on the shelves, it's a sin not to become familiar  Separate respect for schematic illustrations, especially in the ‚Äúhow not to do‚Äù section - 16 pictures on 4 pages.  Much of the following seems obvious, but surely they drew from someone‚Äôs life experience: <br><br><ul><li>  Do not drive on public roads or other motorways. </li><li>  Do not drive through speed bumps and other rapids at high speed </li><li>  Watch the speed when moving from a hill, brake with both brakes </li><li>  Do not ride up and down stairs and do not jump over obstacles (there are trick scooters for this) </li><li>  Do not ride at temperatures below 0 ¬∞ C (harmful to the battery, and the rubber will tan) </li><li>  Do not touch the motor-wheel with your fingers after riding (as it may be hot) </li><li>  Do not operate the scooter with one hand, do not remove your hands while riding </li><li>  Do not turn the steering wheel while driving at high speed. </li><li>  Do not push the throttle while walking next to the scooter </li><li>  Keep your head out when driving through doorways </li><li>  Do not carry heavy objects on the steering wheel. </li><li>  Do not ride a scooter on one leg only. </li><li>  Do not drive through puddles deeper than 2 cm </li><li>  Do not ride a scooter in the rain </li><li>  Do not step on the folding pedal while driving </li><li>  Device for one person only, do not drive together (especially with children) </li></ul><br>  And yet again about the helmet - I recommend to attend to this in advance.  It's all as with backups, only more serious. <br><br><h2>  Assembly </h2><br>  Get ready for the assembly to take about 5 minutes, no less.  First, you should attach the steering wheel: remove the cap from the top of the main pipe (it is correctly called the stem), carefully place the inside of the wiring, connect the connector from the steering wheel to it, insert the steering wheel itself. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/acb/b00/14d/acbb0014db86395206be283a26cab4b7.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/efe/213/d62/efe213d6298749ff4eca8cc60464dcde.jpg"><br><br>  Next, fix the 4 cogs. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/520/7fc/6b9/5207fc6b9fcf4d9fe46a3cbc5310be14.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2eb/59e/89a/2eb59e89aa904f35599713c47c5334d6.jpg"><br><br>  Done :) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2f6/be6/0d6/2f6be60d66f4bd4239d3f202dd1f0e2d.jpg"><br><br>  The remaining 4 minutes will go to the installation of an optional additional battery, but there the process is not much more difficult.  First, three standard screws on the rod are unscrewed and the cover near the charging port is removed.  After that, three screws (10 mm) fasten the bar, which comes with the battery. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6cf/4a0/92f/6cf4a092fe14105b7f38c7d1aee4c097.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1a9/c7f/090/1a9c7f0901606525ca2a15b0889edfc3.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/779/5ae/9c4/7795ae9c4f7b45dcb3840f6b23b05787.jpg"><br><br>  Next, simply hang the battery on it, fasten it with two screws from the kit (20 mm) and plug the holes with rubber plugs.  Next you will need to conjure in a mobile application, but more on that later. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0c7/7ed/8f8/0c77ed8f8cd95d5a43b7184905f77ff4.jpg"><br><br><h2>  Appearance </h2><br>  Two pipes, a board and two wheels - this is if with graphics on minimum salary. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d69/fb3/22a/d69fb322aeb068db05b57f3bc13c70cd.jpg"><br><br>  There are high-quality rubber grips installed on the steering wheel (as opposed to not very comfortable in the ES1), between them there are two mechanical switches with rubber inserts: an electronic throttle is located on the right (if the throttle knob is simple), an electronic brake is on the left. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/533/5e2/9b7/5335e29b72896858bcd24b39b9240b6c.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e39/bba/49d/e39bba49d53ab351c1f93cb64b43c2f0.jpg"><br><br>  In the middle there is an onboard computer on the steering wheel - it displays the current speed (or an error code if something went wrong), bluetooth status, power mode and power level.  The computer screen is harmoniously combined with the multi-function button: it turns on the vehicle and the light on it in (s), and also changes the driving mode. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/12a/5f5/afc/12a5f5afc3f771a2ff84426cff8ad250.jpg"><br><br>  The power level is represented by 5 divisions - each approximately 20%. <br><br>  In the front, under the steering wheel, there is a small but bright LED flashlight (1.5 W).  This is a very useful option: firstly, there is no need to buy additional accessories ( <i>it would be strange if we had to buy something else at the cost of the device</i> ), and secondly, it looks harmonious and does not bulge.  Well, it shines pretty well. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/090/c21/23b/090c2123bc85182fbfc92d15990c206c.jpg"><br><br>  If you want something to get in the way while you are moving, then in this case there is a small hook under the lamp, on which this ‚Äúsomething‚Äù can be hung.  But in general, it is needed primarily for fixing the scooter in the folded state.  The rod itself is a metal pipe (with a not quite circular section - it has ‚Äútriangular‚Äù thickenings for greater rigidity), which is chock-full of batteries and various electronics. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/024/068/7da/0240687dabe0df0583510b909729ab75.jpg"><br><br>  The role of the battery inside is performed by two series-connected blocks of 10 lithium-ion LG batteries, size 18650 (each capacity is 2600 mAh, maximum operating current 10A) - a total of 5.2 Ah.  Connector for charging is even lower.  As mentioned above, the killer feature is the ability to hang an extra battery (of the same capacity) through the standard charging connector: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8c5/20a/54d/8c520a54d125f7b29f1f5d691df53c70.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/793/59d/03a/79359d03ae9fc07afaa590bd1dad1e56.jpg"><br><br>  The steering rack ends up with a shock absorber boot that will smooth out minor irregularities - there will not be enough of it for big ones.  But let it be better than not. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c6e/a86/a10/c6ea86a101454b27b4b16254a36c0004.jpg"><br><br>  The two wheels, of which the front is leading (300W motor-wheel), are of pleasant nuances: they are rather large and with thick rubber - this favorably affects the ride comfort and the durability of the structure as a whole. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/46d/f0e/b51/46df0eb51012a2c6b2896b25c33879ca.jpg"><br><br>  And the front wheel doesn‚Äôt even have spokes, everything is covered with plastic - this way the structure gets less dirty and easier to clean. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a61/564/8b3/a615648b3ab0b5f5c477bc0466270eec.jpg"><br><br>  Pedal for folding scooter.  If the scooter is often folded, the wire may be damaged inside due to the sharp parts - in order to avoid trouble, it is desirable to additionally protect it immediately after purchase.  Pedal can be pressed to the body, so as not to accidentally press while driving. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/115/1fa/a65/1151faa650bcd9931ab628df1e33405e.jpg"><br><br>  When folded, the stem hook clings to the rear fender - in this (assembled) state it can be rolled (more precisely, ‚Äúpush‚Äù, on the front wheel), worn (holding the rod) or thrown into the trunk of a car.  To disassemble the scooter, you need to press the rear fender and pull the steering rack. <br><br>  Deca ("board") is quite elegant - thin, but durable.  And very wide (15 cm).  With a corrugated rubberized coating - accidentally jump off this will not be easy.  It gets dirty instantly (even if you drive in shoe covers), but it is also quite easy to wash (unlike sandpaper) - the dirt does not eats into the coating itself. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c25/ff1/e17/c25ff1e1780b9aee48babb40f15ae903.jpg"><br><br>  At the end of the deck, the rear wheel shock absorber is installed - again, unpretentious (with a hard spring and the ability to adjust it slightly with a hexagon), but again, it is there!  Everything that could be done here for comfort, the manufacturer did. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/884/b65/999/884b65999c6a4dc8af91f09583fd43f7.jpg"><br><br>  The rear wheel has knitting needles - this allows you to use <a href="https://www.gearbest.com/Bicycle-lock-_gear/%3Flkid%3D15321579">bicycle locks</a> , of which we have a car. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6c9/40e/03c/6c940e03c36efbe3d773553da0c95926.jpg"><br><br>  There is a footboard on the deck below - it is not very convenient to lower it, but the scooter stands on it quite safely. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/658/77f/646/65877f6465eb143f941221015e04d42c.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a4e/19a/d45/a4e19ad4555c86decc6e4204c93b466a.jpg"><br><br>  Both wheels have plastic wings, and at the rear it performs the function of a foot brake (in addition to the electronic one on the steering wheel).  It has a small depression (in the folded state - for the steering hook). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b10/cd0/50c/b10cd050c60b2bf0de7e12bc45863b31.jpg"><br><br>  There are luminous inserts on the dropouts (at first it seemed that they were just reflectors), which glow when braking or constantly (like dimensions; if the main lamp is on).  But on the rear wing it is the reflector. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b58/4fb/87d/b584fb87d53b59c66fb62d84e768386e.jpg"><br><br>  A nice feature (downright killer features) of the ES2 and ES4 models is the presence on the bottom of the scooter LED backlight (of 16 LEDs) with customizable special effects.  How filips embilayt :) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/32e/7d9/3e0/32e7d93e0b281e8af16b8ff50e469a8b.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a28/12a/b72/a2812ab7232a62d7d95ee5c92ce231b9.jpg"><br><br>  By the way, the external battery also has a backlight - pulsating red stripes on the sides. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/117/8e7/f5f/1178e7f5f1d1bf46939accc2742bbb8d.jpg"><br><br>  Agree, beautifully turned out?  Like a regular scooter - no sticking wires, everything is hidden inside, nothing outside.  We invested in the design :) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/96a/cfc/86e/96acfc86e136b96d7e70e26101ccf47c.jpg"><br><br><h2>  Mobile app </h2><br>  We scan the QR code from the manual and now the Segway Ninebot application (available for iOS / Android) appears in the smartphone.  We press the button on the scooter, turn on Bluetooth on the phone and scan the air for electric transport. <br><br>  The devices pair and the application immediately offers to update the scooter firmware - why not?  It's great when the manufacturer does not throw support for their products. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e45/375/6c1/e453756c1234221dd28196b10aa24a25.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5dc/27c/fd1/5dc27cfd1a0659f1c4e9d0a631565ddc.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9a1/b6d/bd5/9a1b6dbd532da67d33c90792dbd95080.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/19f/3dd/5ca/19f3dd5ca92063cb4183c4e389080979.png"><br><br>  On the main screen - the speedometer, the direction of travel and other tsatski, on the next - tsiferki (power reserve, speed, device temperature, etc.), in the corners - the menu button.  Everything is neat and beautiful, again on the shelves. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c67/867/c42/c67867c42295b7e1d76c5bbd0209fc60.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/740/44e/59f/74044e59fecc66e0ce2c3d9d2cfb6f7b.png"><br><br>  If you click on the "lock", then the anti-theft system will turn on: if you move the scooter, it will start pinching the built-in speaker and resist movement :) Trifle, but nice. <br><br>  In the settings you can change the name of the scooter, specify the level of recovery, activate the cruise control, set the maximum speed for the eco-mode and turn the tail light on a constant (and not only when braking). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/883/5b5/b2b/8835b5b2b6d9956cbbd9a88439cf69e9.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9b7/21e/805/9b721e8059ec2bc7735f4bfdcf99da10.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/602/a57/ab7/602a57ab7fb151dd5cd45eeb30311a45.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6c6/fb2/2b6/6c6fb22b60360d2f35b8361e45545953.png"><br><br>  In a separate section, all information on the battery (or even both) is displayed: up to their temperature! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b7e/310/eee/b7e310eee7ac29ca93181dd3ad57e3e3.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ffa/91b/025/ffa91b02512f9f0d39d77f834ddcb268.png"><br><br>  But as mentioned above, the most pleasant and wow-spectacular is the backlight, which with a clearance of 8 cm is clearly visible.  The choice of about 10 different modes of operation, for each through the color-picker you can adjust the required colors.  It can burn as a simple light, as a gradient, as a wave (as the light gradually moves from one LED to another), as a ripple, as a siren, etc. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/859/8b1/afc/8598b1afc066d2f316e4f53699e8d9d3.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/949/d32/283/949d32283c8b4bc97a0170fab22ea5d7.png"><br><br>  In my opinion, the coolest option is the two-color siren (from blue and red LEDs) - it is the most noticeable (especially among drivers), which will favorably affect your visibility in the dark. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1af/55e/1d0/1af55e1d0ba738b27f4f8cd1224efa79.jpg"><br><br><h2>  Tests </h2><br>  The screen shows the power mode, which is switched by double pressing a single button.  The choice of three modes: <br><br><ul><li>  White "S": standard mode (speed limit - 25 km / h, current consumption - 10 A) </li><li>  Red "S": sport mode (maximum speed and power - like Ludicrous mode in Tesla; current consumption - 20 A) </li><li>  No ‚ÄúS‚Äù: economy mode (minimum power, speed limited to 16 km / h; current consumption is 4 A) </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/821/6c6/503/8216c6503e7274d4ec17bbc696deb09d.jpg"><br><br>  Let's try small.  We get up on the scooter with one hand, press the acceleration button - hmm, zero reaction.  Let's try another mode ... hmm, silence again.  Something broke?  Oh, no, it could not be so fast, although anything can happen.  Aah, they wrote in the instructions that to start moving you need to push off - you need to ‚Äúsink to the floor‚Äù after giving a little acceleration (or rather, when reaching a speed of 3 km / h).  On the one hand, this is a bug - after all, I want to tear the claws away :) On the other hand, this is a feature - a similar restriction is just for safety (and this is also stated in the instructions). <br><br>  They learned to get under way, but what about braking?  Ohh, yes everything is fine - just press the left petal and the devil-machine starts to slow down intensively, the harder we press, the more it slows down.  In principle, for most cases this braking will suffice, but the manufacturer recommends not to forget about the foot brake (which, if you have an electronic one, you don‚Äôt really want to use it) - it is also very effective (due to the fact that from the back of the rear wing) a profile with a large number of edges is used). <br><br>  By the way, electrical braking is reversible here, due to the fact that a current is fed to the motor winding in the opposite direction (counter-current).  Accordingly, there is no recovery during braking - the battery charge is spent, including braking.  As there is no ‚Äúholding a scooter‚Äù on a slope, without moving and with a dead battery.  Although recovery in the scooter is still there - when riding coasting, that is, every time the gas trigger is released.  Moreover, the recovery level can be specified in the application settings (there are three levels available; you cannot completely disable it) - it is extremely difficult to drive at the maximum, and even at the minimum the roll is not very large. <br><br>  Acceleration is pretty fierce - electric motors can give this still unusual feeling of "vzhuha", even if we are talking about a scooter.  You just pulled the trigger, and you already suffered - speed dialing is pretty fast.  It should be admitted that 30 km / h on a scooter is a bit too much - if you decompose at that speed, then there will be very little enjoyment.  Therefore, do not choose a scooter on the principle of "just to quickly" - think first of all about safety (and how to slow down). <br><br>  Maximum speed, judging by the speedometer - 31 km / h, although the manufacturer promised 30 (did not keep the promise).  The ES2 models and even more so the ES1 can't do it - the speed is more modest there.  And with an external battery, but in sport mode ... the scooter turns into some kind of rocket, it goes much more vigorously. <br><br>  Cruise control is another spoon of honey.  If you turn it on in the app and hold the accelerator trigger for 5 seconds, then the scooter will go on itself at the speed at which you were driving - until you click on one of the hammers.  Fans of ‚ÄúDalnyak‚Äù will definitely appreciate it :) <br><br>  Turning is pretty easy - turn the steering wheel and a slight tilt.  Like an ordinary scooter - nothing to do with turning on a segway or mono-wheel is not here (and it was not expected, just the word ‚ÄúSegway‚Äù in the title still cuts the eye). <br><br>  It is a pleasure to drive on smooth asphalt, on tile it is another.  It is worst of all to drive on the killed asphalt (or with protruding pebbles), as well as on any other road with a large number of irregularities - it is not very comfortable to drive there even with two shock absorbers. <br><br>  On a solid dirt road, you can also go.  But in winter, pokatushki had to be paused: driving in the snow is definitely inconvenient - the drive wheel at the expense of a small area of ‚Äã‚Äãcontact simply digs into the snow, the snow gets hammered under the wing (to which a very small distance) and then the equipment rises.  On the ice, the wheel slides.  On the whole, there is no pleasure in driving in the frost. <br><br>  As for the power reserve, instead of the stated 45 km (with a rider weight of 75 kg), in actual conditions it was 33-35 (with a weight of 85 kg) in a rather ‚Äúhot‚Äù mode, but no direct measurement was made.  30-35-40 km - is it a lot or a little?  For example, the diameter of the Moscow Ring Road (from the western to the eastern point) is just about 30 km - you can drive through the whole of Moscow and still remain. <br><br>  When the last percentages of the battery charge remain, the speed starts dropping, but still the potentials of the electric motor and the batteries leave an exceptionally pleasant impression. <br><br><h2>  Advantages and disadvantages </h2><br>  It turned out that there were so many pluses that we would have to ram them tightly at every point so that the cons were not so offensive.  Let me remind you that the review was about the model Ninebot ES4 (aka ES2 + battery). <br><br>  <b>Advantages:</b> <br><br><ul><li>  Good equipment, detailed and visual instructions </li><li>  Reliable design, protected motor-wheel, the ability to install additional.  battery </li><li>  Availability of front and rear shock absorbers, as well as foot and electronic brakes </li><li>  Quite a powerful motor, high speed and a large supply of autonomous stroke </li><li>  Steep appearance, as well as the presence of a lantern, stop-lamp and custom lights </li><li>  Understandable, informative and convenient mobile application </li></ul><br>  <b>Disadvantages:</b> <br><br><ul><li>  Heavy (if something goes wrong, then wearing 14 kg is not very comfortable, especially for a child) </li><li>  Handles do not fold handles, no height adjustment </li><li>  Even with shock absorbers, there is not enough ‚Äúcross-country vehicle‚Äù </li><li>  High price </li></ul><br>  The advantages could be attributed to: availability of warranty, spare parts and additional accessories, as well as a large user community (= there are already solutions to all possible technical problems).  Useful links below. <br><br>  As for the high cost, it is not so high :) The scooter itself costs between 25,000 rubles and about 12,000 more worth the <a href="https://www.gearbest.com/skateboard/pp_1598113.html%3Flkid%3D15321579">original battery</a> for it.

But at the same time, it also has drawbacks - you cannot put an extra battery, there is no display, the second shock absorber and other structural details. There are also controversial points, for example, the absence of a rear brake at the syokat and its pneumatic wheel - yes, it adds a bit of comfort, but in this case, you will sooner or later encounter punctures, their repair or replacement of rubber. As for the problems, they eventually appear in both models (despite the fact that Ninebot came out later and could take them into account), but they are generally minor and most of them already have solutions. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Take a </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">look at w3bsit3-dns.com -
