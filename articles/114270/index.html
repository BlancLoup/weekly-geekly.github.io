Most likely, when you learned to program, you used it.  Then you learned that it was bad, and you forgot about it.  Although sometimes with complex error handling ... no, no, there try ... throw ... catch.  Or to exit nested loops ... no, there are flags and a lot of difficulties.  Or when nested switches ... no, no, no, there the same flags. <br>  And yet, sometimes in the stillness of the night you would allow a sinful thought into your subconscious mind - ‚Äúwhy not use <em>the</em> goto <em>here</em> ?  And the program seems to be slimmer, and optimally out.  Yes, it would be good ... But no - <em>it</em> is <em>impossible</em> , they forgot! ‚Äù. <br>  Why is it so? <br>  Under the cut - a small investigation and mine, based on years of practice and different platforms, attitude to this issue.  This article is an analogue of <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/cpp/114211/">the same for C ++</a> , but here moments for C and for microcontrollers are highlighted. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Request to goto's ardent opponents - do not overthrow me into hell fire minus karma just because I raised this topic and I am a partial supporter of goto!</b> <br><h4>  A small historical excursion </h4><br>  Those who, even without me, know perfectly well what a combinational circuit is, a circuit with memory, and how an assembler grew out of it - you can safely jump further - to a conclusion. <br><br><h5>  It all started with combinational circuits </h5><br><br><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/89cf247e/4d12e83c/0c626244/b2455977.jpg"><br>  At the beginning there was a word - and the word was a function.  It is not so important that it was a Boolean function of a logical variable - then, in this basis, they managed to implement all (almost) mathematics, and then texts, graphics ... Anyway, it turned out that with the help of computer technology it is very convenient to do arithmetic, and then trigonometric and other actions and find the values ‚Äã‚Äãof the functions of the variable.

      In other words, you had to make a device that, by the value of a variable (variables), found the value of a function. <br><br>  To solve this difficult task, a <em>sequential</em> algorithm was built to perform arithmetic operations (in the case of a given accuracy of calculations in such an algorithm, each arithmetic operation can be performed in one clock). <br><br>  Having an algorithm, it is easy to construct a combinational circuit - a circuit that instantly (up to the response of logic devices and signal propagation time) gave the answer at the output. <br>  The question is - do you need any transitions?  No, they are simply not there.  There is a consistent course of action.  All these actions can be implemented ultimately in a single cycle (I don‚Äôt argue, it will be very, very cumbersome, but given the digit capacity of all the data, any student will build such a scheme for you - and even more so a synthesizer for VHDL or Verilog). <br><br><h5>  But then the memory circuits intervened. </h5><br><br><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/5ffa26b3/8c6a5f4b/9b26d921/99d64404.jpg"><br>  And then someone's clever head came up with a scheme with feedback - for example, an RS trigger.  And then the <em>state of the</em> scheme appeared.  And the state is nothing but the current value of all the elements with memory. <br><br>  The appearance of such memory elements made it possible to make a revolutionary leap forward from hard-coded devices to firmware automata.  Simply put, there is a command memory in firmware automata.  There is a separate device that implements the current firmware (addition, subtraction, or something else).  But the choice of "current" firmware is a separate device - let it be a "sampling device". <br><br>  The question is - are there any transitions?  Definitely yes!  Moreover, there are unconditional transitions (the address of the next command does not depend on the current state of the data) and conditional (the address of the next command depends on the state of the data). <br><br>  Is it possible to do without them?  No way!  If we don‚Äôt use transitions, we‚Äôll go back to the memoryless combinational circuit. <br><br><h5>  As a result, we come to the assembler </h5><br><br>  The apotheosis of such computing devices are micro, simple and super computers.  All of them are based on a language of codes, which is rather easily converted into an Assembler with an approximately identical set of instructions.  Consider a certain averaged assembler of microcontrollers (I am familiar with the assembler for ATmeg-i, PIC and AT90).  How does his transition work? <br><br>  Transitions are unconditional (just go to the next address, go to the subroutine, exit it) and conditional (depending on the state of the flags). <br><br>  I declare with all responsibility - <em>it is impossible to do without transition operations in assembler!</em>  Any program in assembly language is just full of them!  However, there is no one to argue with me here, I think it will not. <br><br><h5>  Total </h5><br><br>  What can be summed up?  At the microprocessor level, transition operations are used very actively.  It‚Äôs almost impossible to write a real program that doesn‚Äôt use them (maybe it can be done, but it will be a super-mega perversion and certainly not a real program!).  Nobody will argue with this either. <br><br>  But why, then, in languages ‚Äã‚Äãof a higher level - let's concentrate on C for microcontrollers - did the goto operator suddenly fall into disfavor? .. <br><br><h4>  Little about algorithms </h4><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/310934fc/181ed3b3/fe6a96d8/3b25af0c.jpg"><br>  And now we will look at the cunning algorithm.  I have no idea what this nonsense is, but it must be implemented.  We assume this is the TK. <br><br>  Here A, B, C, D, E are some <i>operations</i> , not a function call!  It is possible that they use a lot of local variables.  And it is quite possible that they change their state.  That is, in this case we are not talking about calling functions - some actions will not be detailed. <br><br>  Here‚Äôs what it looks like with goto: <br><br><pre><code class="cpp hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">if</span></span> (a) { A; <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">goto</span></span> L3; } L1: <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">if</span></span> (b) { L2: B; L3: C; <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">goto</span></span> L1; } <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">else</span></span> <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">if</span></span> (!c) { D; <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">goto</span></span> L2; } E;</code> </pre> <br><br>  Very concise and readable.  But - <em>no!</em>  Let's try without goto: <br><br><pre> <code class="cpp hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">char</span></span> bf1, bf2, bf3; <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">if</span></span> (a) { A; bf1 = <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">1</span></span>; } <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">else</span></span> bf1 = <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">0</span></span>; bf2 = <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">0</span></span>; <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">do</span></span> { <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">do</span></span> { <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">if</span></span> (bf3 || b) bf3 = <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">1</span></span>; <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">else</span></span> bf3 = <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">0</span></span>; <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">if</span></span> (bf3 || bf2) B; <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">if</span></span> (bf3 || bf1 || bf2) { C; bf1 = <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">0</span></span>; bf2 = <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">1</span></span>; } <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">if</span></span> (!bf3) { <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">if</span></span> (!c) { D; bf3 = <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">1</span></span>; } <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">else</span></span> { bf3 = <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">0</span></span>; bf2 = <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">0</span></span>; } } } <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">while</span></span> (bf3); } <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">while</span></span> (bf2); E;</code> </pre><br><br>  Did you understand anything from the logic of the second listing? .. <br>  Compare both listings: <br><br><ul><li>  I spent the first listing 5 times less than the second. </li><li>  Listing with goto is shorter at least 2 times. </li><li>  Listing with goto will be understood by any person with the most minimal preparation in C. The second I tried to make it as accessible and obvious as possible - and still, one must go into it for a long time. </li><li>  How long will it take to debug the first option and how much to debug the second? </li><li>  And in general, if we assume that the algorithm we have drawn up is a problem statement, then the first listing is 100% correct.  About the second one, I'm still not very sure ... at least in the order of checking conditions and flags. </li><li>  Compare the resulting assembly code of the first and second listing. </li></ul><br><br>  But in the second listing there is no goto! <br><br>  I was also <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/cpp/114211/">offered</a> this algorithm to implement something like this: <br><br> <code><br> if a <br> A <br> C <br> <br> while b or not c <br> if not b <br> D <br> B <br> C <br> <br> E <br> <br></code> <br><br>  It seems to be beautiful, yes?  Why not make a copy-past, why not wind up additional checks, why ... <i>do anything except goto !!!</i> <br><br>  Well, okay, in life such algorithms almost never occur.  Better talk about life. <br><br><h4>  goto in real programs </h4><br><br>  In my more than 20 years of experience, I went through several hardware platforms and a dozen programming languages, participated in writing a large <a href="http://www.aldec.com/activehdl/">ActiveHDL</a> software product, made a commercial database and many small programs for debugging equipment used in the Olympics, and also made devices for this Olympiad itself (already several Olympiads, to be exact).  In short, I am fiddling with programming.  And, yes, I forgot - I graduated with an honorary diploma from <a href="http://kture.kharkov.ua/opencms/opencms/KNURE/index.html%3F__locale%3Den">KNURE</a> - I mean, in theory, I am also a secular. <br><br>  Therefore, my subsequent reflections and situations ... let's say, I have a moral right to them. <br><br><h5>  Implicit use of goto </h5><br><br>  In C, there are many operators that are actually banal goto - conditional or unconditional.  These are all kinds of for (...), while (...) {...}, do {...} while (...) loops.  This is an analysis of numeric variables switch (...) {case ... case ...}.  These are the same interrupt / branch statements in the break and continue cycles.  In the end, these are calls of funct () functions and exiting return. <br><br>  These goto are considered "legal" - what is the goto itself illegal? <br><br><h5>  What goto is accused of </h5><br><br>  He is accused of the fact that the code becomes unreadable, poorly optimized and errors may occur.  This is about practical cons.  And the theoretical - it's just bad and illiterate, and that's it! <br><br>  As for unreadable code and poor optimizability, take another look at the listings above. <br>  As for the probability of errors, I agree, such code is perceived somewhat more complicated due to the fact that we are used to reading the listing from top to bottom.  But that's all!  And what, other means With safe and cannot create errors in the code?  Yes, take at least type conversions, work with pointers.  There to screw up - for nothing to do! <br><br>  Do not you think that a knife is a very dangerous thing?  But for some reason in the kitchen we use it.  And 220 volts - how terrible it is!  But if you use it wisely, you can live. <br><br>  Same goto.  You need to use it wisely - and then the code will work correctly. <br><br>  And about the theoretical arguments - forgive me, this is a dispute about tastes.  Do you use the <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2592%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F">Hungarian notation</a> ?  I - no, I can not stand her!  But I'm not saying that she is bad because of this!  Personally, I think that a variable should carry a meaning - for which it was created.  But I will not prohibit other people from using this method of naming! <br><br>  Or there are aesthetes who believe that writing a = ++ i is illiterate, it is necessary to write i = i + 1;  a = i.  And now, ban it too? <br><br><h5>  Error processing </h5><br><br>  Take the processing of input packets from some external device: <br><br><pre> <code class="cpp hljs">pack = receive_byte (); <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">switch</span></span> (pack) { <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">case</span></span> <span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">'A'</span></span>: <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">for</span></span> (f = <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">0</span></span>; f &lt; <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">10</span></span>; ++f) { ‚Ä¶ <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">if</span></span> (timeout) <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">goto</span></span> Leave; ‚Ä¶ } <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">break</span></span>; <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">case</span></span> <span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">'B'</span></span>: ‚Ä¶ } Leave: ‚Ä¶</code> </pre><br><br>  We received a package header.  Analyzed  Yeah, the package 'A' means we have to do something 10 times.  We do not forget to control the time of work of this area - and suddenly the second side is stuck?  Yeah, it‚Äôs still hanging - the timeout condition worked - then we‚Äôre going out - out of the loop, out of the switch. <br><br>  The same can be done with all sorts of flags - but it will work slower, plus take up such a deficient memory cell.  It's worth it? <br><br>  This case is simple.  But receive_byte () can also be a macro function with timeout processing.  And there will also be such sharp exits here. <br><br>  This is exactly the case where I actively use goto.  This allowed me not to fall into a ‚Äúfreeze‚Äù in case of problems with external devices, UART, USB, etc. <br><br><h5>  Exit nested loop out </h5><br><br>  See the program below: <br><br><pre> <code class="cpp hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">char</span></span> a, b, c; <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">for</span></span> (a = <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">0</span></span>; a &lt; <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">10</span></span>; ++a) { <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">for</span></span> (b = <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">0</span></span>; b &lt; a; ++b) { <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">if</span></span> (!c) <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">goto</span></span> Leave; } <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">for</span></span> (b = <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">10</span></span>; b &lt; <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">15</span></span>; ++b) { d (); } } Leave: e ();</code> </pre><br><br>  What is happening - you understand?  There is a nested loop.  If any condition comes, we leave all subsequent processing. <br><br>  This code with flags looks different: <br><br><pre> <code class="cpp hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">char</span></span> a, b, c, f1; f1 = <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">1</span></span>; <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">for</span></span> (a = <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">0</span></span>; a &lt; <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">10</span></span> &amp;&amp; f1; ++a) { <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">for</span></span> (b = <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">0</span></span>; b &lt; a &amp;&amp; f1; ++b) { <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">if</span></span> (!c) f1 = <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">0</span></span>; } <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">if</span></span> (f1) { <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">for</span></span> (b = <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">10</span></span>; b &lt; <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">15</span></span>; ++b) { d (); } } } e ();</code> </pre><br><br>  What happened in this case?  At each iteration, we now check the flag.  Do not forget to check it further.  These are trifles, if there are few iterations and it is about the "dimensionless" memory of the PC.  And when the program is written for the microcontroller - all this is already becoming significant. <br><br>  By the way, in connection with this, in some languages ‚Äã‚Äã(if I‚Äôm not mistaken, in Java) there is an opportunity to break out of the loop by a label like break Leave.  The same goto, by the way! <br><br>  I can give the exact same example with processing in switch (...) {case ...}.  I often come across this when processing incoming packets of unequal structure. <br><br><h5>  Automatic code generation </h5><br><br>  Do you know machine programming?  Or any other automated code generation?  Say, the creators of lexical handlers (without using the cumbersome boost :: spirit).  All these programs create code that can be used as a ‚Äúblack box‚Äù - it doesn't matter to you what's inside;  It matters to you what he does.  And inside there goto is used very, very often ... <br><br><h5>  Exit in one place </h5><br><br>  On C, sometimes you have to write something like: <br><br><pre> <code class="cpp hljs"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">int</span></span></span><span class="hljs-function"> </span><span class="hljs-title"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-title">f</span></span></span><span class="hljs-function"> </span><span class="hljs-params"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-params">(‚Ä¶)</span></span></span><span class="hljs-function"> </span></span>{ ‚Ä¶ <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">if</span></span> (a) { c = <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">15</span></span>; <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">return</span></span> <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">10</span></span>; } ‚Ä¶ <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">if</span></span> (b) { c = <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">15</span></span>; <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">return</span></span> <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">10</span></span>; } ‚Ä¶  = <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">10</span></span>; <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">return</span></span> <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">5</span></span>; }</code> </pre><br><br>  This code will look much more accurate like this: <br><br><pre> <code class="cpp hljs"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">int</span></span></span><span class="hljs-function"> </span><span class="hljs-title"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-title">f</span></span></span><span class="hljs-function"> </span><span class="hljs-params"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-params">(‚Ä¶)</span></span></span><span class="hljs-function"> </span></span>{ ‚Ä¶ <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">if</span></span> (a) <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">goto</span></span> Exit; ‚Ä¶ <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">if</span></span> (b) <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">goto</span></span> Exit; ‚Ä¶  = <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">10</span></span>; <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">return</span></span> <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">5</span></span>; Exit: c = <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">15</span></span>; <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">return</span></span> <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">10</span></span>; }</code> </pre><br><br>  Is the idea clear?  Sometimes you need to do something at the exit.  Sometimes a <em>lot of things</em> have to be done.  And then goto helps a lot.  I also have such examples. <br>  It seems to have listed everything, now you can let it down ... <br><br><h4>  Total </h4><br><br>  This is <strong>my</strong> point of view!  And she is fair to me.  Maybe - for you, but I will not force you to follow her! <br><br>  So, for me it is obvious that goto helps to solve some problems more optimally and with better quality. <br>  And it happens the other way around - goto can cause a lot of problems. <br><br>  <b>UPD</b> : Having read a lot of comments, I selected for myself the positive aspects of using goto and the negative ones. <br><br>  <b>Advantages of using goto</b> : <br><ul><li>  the most optimal (with so-called listing and result code) output from several nested loops and switch ... case </li><li>  C: the most economical (by listing and result code) error handling </li><li>  <i>in individual cases, the</i> most optimal construction of the algorithm </li><li>  saves memory and ticks when used <i>carefully</i> , which is sometimes of paramount importance </li></ul><br>  <b>Cons of using goto</b> : <br><ul><li>  code unusualness </li><li>  violation of the sequence of reading the listing from top to bottom and standardized bypass of blocks in the code ( <i>in the sense that it is possible to go to the center of the block, as well as exit from it</i> ) </li><li>  complication to the compiler (and sometimes impossibility) of the code optimization process </li><li>  increase in the probability of creating subtle errors in the code </li></ul><br><br>  Who else will tell the pros / cons?  I will enter if they are justified. <br><br>  Once again I pay attention: <b>I do not call Tuli goto everywhere</b> !  BUT in some cases, it allows you to implement the algorithm much more effectively than all other means. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/114270/">https://habr.com/ru/post/114270/</a></p>
