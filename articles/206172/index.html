According to her, in general, her expectations were met, but the most important event in the domain, not only of domains, but of the entire Internet, came as a surprise. <a name="habracut"></a><br>  But first things first: <br><br>  <b># 10 Registry protection vulnerabilities detected</b> <br><br>  This year, a record number of registry security system hacks were recorded: 23 cases.  Popular national domains <a href="http://domainhit.ru/news/1634/">.CN (China)</a> , .BE (Belgium) and .MY (Malaysia) were subjected to cyber attacks using DDoS, social engineering and brute force (Brute Force) technologies.

      <b># 9 The overall growth of the domain market continues</b> <br><br>  According <a href="http://www.verisigninc.com/assets/infographic-dnib-Q32013.pdf">to the VeriSign report</a> , at the end of the third quarter of 2013, 265 million second-level domains were registered.  The number of registered domains increased by 8% compared with last year.  Growth in national zones was 14%. <br><br>  <b># 8 DNSSEC remains unclaimed</b> <b><br></b> <br>  The DNSSEC security protocol successfully protects domains from pharming (hidden user redirection to other IP addresses).  But despite the fact that the technology has become widely available, even in the US it is used by no more than 1% of industrial companies and 5% of universities. <br><br>  <b># 7 ICANN Improvements</b> <br><br>  Through the mobilization of additional resources and increased accountability within the organization, ICANN has become better at fulfilling its DNS support tasks.  In particular, violations of the registration agreement were found by one of the largest registrars in the world and the possible consequences of this were eliminated. <br><br>  <b># 6 FBI continues to select domains</b> <br><br>  According <a href="http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2013/06/domains-seized/">to</a> the 2013 <a href="http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2013/06/domains-seized/">White House report</a> , over the past three years, US law enforcement agencies have seized more than 1,700 domains whose owners were not only selling fake drugs and other goods.  The police also closed many domains through which sports competitions were broadcast illegally, as well as music, videos and other materials protected by copyright. <br><br>  <b># 5 Secondary domain market has stabilized</b> <br><br>  The number of domains <a href="http://www.dnjournal.com/ytd-sales-charts.htm">sold at high prices</a> this year has remained steadily high.  Stabilized domestic market between domain investors.  It is worth noting the decrease in the number of attempts to seize a domain by illegal means. <br><br>  <b># 4 Future Whois Unknown</b> <br><br>  This year, ICANN announced its intention to create a <a href="http://domainhit.ru/news/1642/">new replacement service for Whois</a> .  This will be a centralized service, through which access to the maximum amount of personal information will be available only to brand owners and law enforcement agencies.  For other users, most of the information will be hidden.  However, the development of a new service will not begin soon. <br><br>  <b># 3 Many registrars suffered from failures and cyber attacks</b> <br><br>  This year, a number of the largest registrars fell victim to technical failures and hacker attacks.  For example, one of the registrars was forced to temporarily suspend work due to a failure of the name server.  In another case, the registrar was hacked using social engineering, as a result of which, when visiting many sites (including sites of large firms), the site was redirected to a site created with the aim of promoting political interests. <br>  According to Eliza Cooper, this could have been avoided if registrars and domain owners used the domain lock service at the registry level (Registry Locking). <br><br>  <b># 2 New gTLD program is finally running</b> <br><br>  After many years of waiting and numerous delays, the program for registering new domain zones has finally been launched.  Already, companies must decide on which domains and in which zones they will register, as well as take care of <a href="http://domainhit.ru/news/1679/">protecting their trademark</a> . <br><br>  <b># 1 ICANN focuses on Internet governance</b> <br><br>  Pressure from states, the desire of international organizations for globalization, as well as Snowden‚Äôs revelations that the US authorities interfered with Internet governance, violating users ‚Äôpersonal privacy rights, motivated ICANN and some technical organizations to conclude <a href="http://www.icann.org/en/news/announcements/announcement-07oct13-en.htm">an agreement in Montevideo</a> . <br><br>  ICANN is now focused on creating such a mechanism for managing the Internet, which will take into account the interests of all parties, but in which the Internet will not be entirely in the hands of politicians: management must be engaged in organizing a technical focus, to which ICANN itself belongs. <br><br>  The next year, according to Eliza Cooper, will be marked by the successful launch of dozens of new domain zones and the success of branded top-level domains. <br><br>  Problems with network security are likely to remain at the same level, but it is quite possible that the number of violations will be reduced, since now they are actively working to eliminate these problems. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/206172/">https://habr.com/ru/post/206172/</a></p>
