  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Tool for quick website creation</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  So, you have already decided.  You need a website!  What's next?  Order a long and expensive development?  Ask a student or system administrator to work?  Of course, this is not an option.  After all, there are more effective solutions.  One of these solutions will be discussed in this article. <br><br>  To date, the fastest option to create a site is the use of online-designers.  Such a system, with very limited functionality, is the site builder on Narod.ru.  Of course, this is a free solution, and I would even say, it‚Äôs rather the designer of individual pages of the site, rather than the whole site.  What is terribly uncomfortable. <br><br>  The site designer is a management system that, with simple interaction with a person, forms all the stuffing, all the functionality of the site.  The user is only required to enter information (text, pictures), the system does the rest for him.  Traditional site designers have always been executed in the form of programs that were installed on your computer, and created a set of files for the site.  To test the functionality of all site functions, it was necessary to install a web server on your computer and test the site.  The second option is to buy a domain name and suitable hosting, download your website to a remote server, and after that check the operation of the website.

      Modern solutions offer us a 3 in 1 system - website builder, hosting and domain name.  And the most advanced solutions do not require the installation of additional programs, it is enough just to connect to the Internet to the administrative part of your site - the editor.  Thus, you can log in to your site under an individual login and password, and enter the necessary information. <br><br>  The functionality of such solutions is very different.  It can be free designers (like Narod.ru), which do not have additional features, as well as paid systems. <br><br>  I want to introduce you to the intellectual system of e-Gloryon.  Why ask intellectual?  Because I have a feeling that she knows everything that I need.  I want to make a photo album on the site - and by clicking on the mouse button, a photo album appears.  I wanted to make a catalog of goods on the site with prices and the possibility of placing an order through the basket - please.  Opportunities are many.  A lot of additional settings, services, and all this at a reasonable price. <br><br>  There are also disadvantages to which I personally closed my eyes.  The site, managed via the Internet, is stored in the company that provides this service.  At first it bothered me, because I used to store all the data on a computer disk, when they are all at hand, I'm so much calmer.  But then, I somehow deleted the necessary information on my website, contacted the support service, and I restored the site the previous day.  Thus, every day there is an automatic backup of my site.  After that, I began to worry much less about data integrity. <br><br>  The on-line constructor of the e-Gloryon website can be trusted.  Judge for yourself, the service was opened in 2002 and over 5 years more than 5,000 sites have been created.  It says a lot.  Perhaps large corporations that require complex architecture, such a site is not suitable, but for small and medium businesses - the most it.  For individuals, professionals is also very convenient. <br><br>  I created my own website using this system.  His address is <a href="http://pervyshag.ru/">pervyshag.ru</a> - As you can see, I have already tied a second-level domain name to it.  With the help of this service it is done within 5 minutes.  Very handy thing, I recommend it to everyone! <br><br>  <a href="http://pervyshag.ru/sites"><strong>Register a free demo site</strong></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/10861/">https://habr.com/ru/post/10861/</a></p>
