      <em>‚ÄúAtari fueled expectations from its gaming machine.</em>  <em>The Atari 2600 gaming console was a real gadget of the year, and games that attracted large crowds were displayed on the Atari stand. ‚Äù</em> <br>  <em>- Michael Tomczyk</em> <br><br>  After the presentation at CES in January, Atari continued its marketing promotion, including the largest television advertising campaign in its history.  One of the very first advertised games of this campaign in January was <em>Space Invaders</em> , written by Rick Maurer (who had previously worked on Fairchild Channel F) and turned out to be a loud hit.  Simply put, <em>Space Invaders</em> saved the VCS. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <em>‚ÄúVCS was not doing so well - they sold only a few million cars, and it seemed that the console was dying.</em>  <em>But then</em> Space Invaders <em>came out</em> <em>, and bam!</em>  <em>- the market exploded.</em> <br>  <em>- Larry Kaplan</em> <br><br>  Although the licensing of <em>Space Invaders was</em> handled by Manny Gerard and Ray Cassar, it was Morera who had the idea to create a version of the game before anyone ever thought of it.  Morer began working on <em>Space Invaders</em> in 1978, when he was just beginning to learn VCS programming, and this process was not easy for him. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1c4/374/bde/1c4374bded0e3914c32d8bd13af54d58.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <em>"When working with VCS, it was necessary to forget about all the good programming practices that I learned."</em> <br>  <em>- Rick Morer</em> <br><br>  Development began well, but then it seemed that Morer was stumped.  The game worked, but it seemed that no one in the consumer equipment department was interested in the <em>Space Invaders</em> version for VCS. <br><br>  <em>‚ÄúAfter a few months, the game was already interesting to play.</em>  <em>But almost no one was interested in her, no one wanted to play it. ‚Äù</em> <br>  <em>- Rick Morer</em> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/34a/363/59f/34a36359fb93d487988f63fed759a6f8.jpg"><br><br>  Morer went on to create the <em>Maze Craze</em> (also released in 1980), because he thought that programming the <em>Maze Craze</em> would help him develop development skills for VCS and prepare for <em>Space Invaders</em> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/cd2/6a4/e2a/cd26a4e2a2a9d93ab0a362d9885489dc.png" alt="image"><br>  <em>Maze craze</em> <br><br>  Much later, in early 1979, Manny Gerard persuaded Ray Cassar to license Taito to play for VCS. <br><br>  <em>‚ÄúCassar flew to Japan in 1979 for the sole purpose of getting Space Invaders.</em>  <em>He achieved this by turning a brilliant deal that earns Atari millions of dollars and launches 2600 into orbit. ‚Äù</em> <br>  <em>- Kevin Bowen, GameSpy, 25 Smartest Moments In Gaming</em> <br><br>  This allowed Morera to continue working on the game, this time officially.  Developing <em>Space Invaders</em> at 2600 was more difficult for Morera.  As a graphic, he used a rudimentary ‚Äúprogrammers' graphic,‚Äù but he wanted the cartridge box designer to draw his illustrations of enemies on checkered paper to transfer to the game.  This did not happen, so Morer used his own drawings. <br><br>  Initially, <em>Space Invaders</em> took 7 KB, but it needed to be trimmed to 4 KB, so Rick rewrote the code for three more months, fighting to save every single byte. <br><br>  By the end of the development process, its beautifully structured code had become a maze of JMP branches, but was as concise as possible. <br><br>  The finished product looked amazing.  The game had 112 variations, Morera managed to shove all possible <em>Space Invaders</em> variants into a VCS cartridge.  Although the game did not completely copy the original, it was played surprisingly similar.  Morera's fellow programmers were delighted with the game.  Rob Fulop put it better than anyone else: ‚ÄúFucking brilliant.‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/de6/115/152/de6115152a4746ee4e0d9ea70077943d.jpg"><br><br>  After the release of <i>Space Invaders</i> on VCS in early 1980, it instantly became a hit.  Total game earned for Atari more than 100 million dollars. <br><br>  The game was so successful that it proved the possibility of a long life for VCS.  Ray Cassar realized that VCS may not be just a seasonal product.  The release of games, previously scheduled for the holidays, stretched out for the whole year. <br><br>  In addition, it pushed Atari's marketing department to experiment with other arcade games.  Began to develop new adaptations for VCS, such as <em>Asteroids</em> and <em>Super Breakout</em> .  Simply put, <em>Space Invaders</em> was the turning point for home video games.  She prepared the stage for a revolution of arcades on home systems.  By Christmas 1980, VCS with <em>Space Invaders</em> became an obligatory holiday purchase. <br><br>  <em>"... it is expected that one of the biggest blockbusters of this Christmas season will be the electronic game</em> Space Invaders <em>Atari, which collects lines every day at the Woodward &amp; Lothrop store."</em> <br>  <em>- Douglas Chevalier,</em> Washington Post <em>, November 10, 1980</em> <br><br>  However, the success of <em>Space Invaders</em> had one sacrifice: Rick Morer.  Both <em>Space Invaders</em> and <em>Maze Craze</em> were widely recognized as one of the very best games created for VCS, but they were the only games written by Morer.  After the resounding success of <em>Space Invaders</em> , who saved Atari and made possible the future of home video games, Morer received a prize of only 11 thousand dollars.  Disappointed with the industry, Morer left the company and never again made games for the Atari VCS. <br><br>  Atari has a new goal: launching games throughout the year and selling them to hundreds of thousands of new customers.  For this it was necessary during the 1980s to throw into the market as many VCS games as possible. <br><br>  One of the first was written by Mike Laurenzen ( <em>Circus Atari)</em> , released in January.  <em>Circus Atari</em> was a rewritten version of <em>Breakout</em> (and an almost complete copy of the Exidy <em>Circus</em> arcade game) in which the player launched clowns bursting balls from a platform into the air.  Despite its simplicity, <em>Circus Atari</em> was a pretty good game. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d51/eff/0d0/d51eff0d0f9eb98490aecdbe71571aff.png"><br><br>  Many other inconspicuous games followed <em>Circus Atari</em> and <em>Space Invaders</em> .  These games were basically a repetition of the old and an attempt to fill in the gaps in the VCS lineup, and not to become big hits.  They were <em>3D-Tic-Tac-Toe</em> and <em>Video Checkers</em> (both created by one of the first programmers for VCS Carol Show), exclusive to Sears <em>Golf</em> , new games <em>Steeplechase</em> , <em>Stellar Track</em> and <em>Othello</em> . <br><br>  <em>‚ÄúI did the Othello version for the 2600 by myself, until my boss caught me at work when I made the last changes before releasing into production.‚Äù</em> <br>  <em>- Ed Logg</em> <br><br>  One really unique game of 1980 was the <em>Championship Soccer by</em> Steve Wright.  Although the limited football possibilities were not much better than other stripped-down VCS sports games such as <em>Home Run</em> and <em>Football</em> , the goal score was unprecedented: a salute salute. <br><br>  <em>‚ÄúWhat about the fireworks in honor of a goal scored - isn't that cool?‚Äù</em> <br>  <em>- Bill Kenkel (co-founder of Electronic Games magazine)</em> <br><br>  It was a stunning graphic effect that takes the game to a different level of quality.  Some players simply let each other score goals to enjoy the explosions of fireworks.  Not surprisingly, programmer Steve Wright no longer created a single game, but instead became a respected and successful guru of digital effects and computer graphics for films and television. <br><br>  One of the best games of 1980 was <em>Night Driver</em> , written by Rob Fulop and released in August.  In this port, from the Atari <em>Night Driver</em> arcade, a pseudo-three-dimensional perspective was used to simulate a fast ride. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/00b/56a/367/00b56a3678e20b9fe54af6f155aa045b.png" alt="image"><br>  <em>Night driver</em> <br><br>  <em>"My first project in this group was</em> Night Driver <em>, which began when Larry Kaplan handed me a bunch of code and said:" Maybe you can make it work, but for now it looks like an extra headache "... I think then in my heart he was ready to leave the company and did not want to start a new game. ‚Äù</em> <br>  <em>- Rob Fulop</em> <br><br>  The year 1980 witnessed the growing trend of a new type of game for VCS: the unreleased treasure.  Atari's marketing team shifted the focus from development and unique concepts to licensed brands.  Some finished games for VCS were put on the shelf and never released.  Bob Polaro's <em>Stunt Cycle</em> (Bob Polaro) was one of the first such games. <br><br>  It was originally developed as a version of the game from an Atari arcade machine, but the marketing department tried to turn it into a game under license from <em>Dukes Of Hazzard</em> .  As a result, the project has not been released.  Another such game in 1980 was Chris Crawford's <em>Wizard</em> , which fell victim to the transition from 2-kilobyte to 4-kilobyte games for VCS. <br><br><h1>  1980: home competition </h1><br>  On April 25, 1980, the Fantastic Four announced that it would create games for Atari VCS in its new company, Activision.  At first, there was almost no reaction from Atari.  The company announced four games: <em>Boxing</em> , <em>Fishing Derby</em> , <em>Dragster</em> and <em>Checkers</em> .  The statement of Activision was not too loud, and very few people paid attention to it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3eb/b66/147/3ebb66147d71254f77036214de527100.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Mattel intellivision</i> <br><br>  A big problem for Atari was the emergence of several serious VCS competitors.  The test version of Mattel Intellivision was launched on the market in 1979, and mass production began in 1980.  In total 200 thousand devices were sold, and in many respects this console was considered better than the Atari VCS.  This competition could have been avoided (or at least postponed for a while) if Ray Cassar followed Nolan Bushnell‚Äôs strategy to block the production of SLI chips. <br><br>  <em>‚ÄúWhen I sold Warner to the company and after I left, Ray Cassar studied the situation and said:‚Äú Bushnell is a real idiot, why does he need five projects for the production of different chips? ‚ÄùHe canceled all but the best ones.</em>  <em>One went to Texas Instruments, the other to Bally, and the third to Mattel.</em>  <em>And so, with one stroke of the pen, he created three serious competitors for himself. ‚Äù</em> <br>  <em>- Nolan Bushnell</em> <br><br>  All this has always been from a legal point of view in the "gray" area.  Mattel Intellivision equipment specifications were very similar to a project called the Atari 3200. The 3200 was supposed to be the successor system to the 2600, but the development did not start until 1981. <br><br>  <em>‚ÄúAccording to development logs, in 1981, Atari began work on a new video game console that could replace the Atari 2600 Video Computer System.</em>  <em>In the process of developing a new console has changed a lot of code names: Sylvia, Super-Stella and even ... PAM (with a note next to it: ‚ÄúSuper-Stella: Multipurpose‚Äú).</em>  <em>This new console should be based on a 10-bit processor and have more memory, high-resolution graphics and improved sound, while maintaining compatibility with all Atari 2600 games released. ‚Äù</em> <br>  <em>- Curt Vendel</em> <br><br>  The most obvious similarity between 3200 and Intellivision was the addition of 10-bit internals, which were unusual, because 8-bit systems were the norm. <br><br>  The 3200 console was never created, and Atari switched to other projects for the successors of the 2600. However, if this is so, it means that Ray Cassar‚Äôs disdain for development and his misunderstanding of Bushnell‚Äôs strategy led to fierce competition with Atari VCS in the early 80s. <br><br><h1>  1980: Atari Electronics </h1><br>  By 1980, the future of the Atari electronics department was very bleak.  <em>Touch-Me was</em> not successful, and new products under development looked doubtful at best.  El Acorn, Roger Hector and Harry Jenkins ran a team that developed <em>Cosmos</em> , a separate console that combined an LED screen with holographic images.  The holograms looked interesting, but were simple decorations.  The games themselves took place on the LED screen. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/dca/c8b/505/dcac8b5050c3331b32b53296a5c80ad1.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Atari cosmos</i> <br><br>  <em>"... you played a board game, and then a hologram appeared. They suggested that GAMES would be holograms!"</em> <br>  <em>- Bill Kenkel</em> <br><br>  But still, the public had a great interest in Cosmos, and the team was keen to demonstrate the product at 1981 CES. <br><br><h1>  1980: home computers </h1><br>  Atari 8-bit computers in 1979 had very little time for sales, so 1980 was the current year of their distribution. Several games for the platform were released at the beginning of the year, including <em>3D-Tic-Tac-Toe</em> , <em>Super Breakout</em> and <em>Space Invaders</em> .  <em>Space Invaders</em> was especially interesting. <br><br>  Although Atari was licensed from Taito, and 8-bit computers had enough power to reproduce the game accurately, programmer Rob Fulop decided to create a completely different version. <br><br>  <em>‚ÄúThe reason why the Atari 800 version was different from the original was simple and somewhat annoying.</em>  <em>I was then 23 years old, and I have already created one ‚Äúport‚Äù (</em> Night Driver <em>for 2600).</em>  <em>I decided that I was too cool to make a complete copy of an existing game with machine guns.</em>  <em>You have to remember that in Atari no one approved the programmers for the plans.</em>  <em>In essence, people like me were given complete freedom in creating any kind of products.</em>  <em>There were no approval processes, meetings and requirements.</em> <br><br>  <em>In retrospect, such freedom was, in my opinion, awesome given the current production requirements.</em>  <em>But at that time everything was decided by the programmer.</em>  <em>Nobody asked me to do</em> Space Invaders <em>, it was my choice.</em>  <em>I decided to change the original, but not because it was ‚Äúbad.‚Äù</em>  <em>I just wanted to sign my name, whatever that means. ‚Äù</em> <br>  <em>- Rob Fulop</em> <br><br>  The game was so different that independent developer Joe Hellesen (who would then create many other games for 8-bit systems, ST and Amiga, including <em>Pac-Man</em> for Atari 8-bit computers) created an almost perfect copy in 1981 arcade game. <br><br>  However, after the initial release of games for 8-bit computers, Atari was ready to stop all the development of games for the machine.  Atari leadership sought to emphasize that this is a computer, and to stop comparing with VCS. <br><br>  <em>"One of the very rare decisions we were confident about was the decision to clearly separate the home computer from the video game console ... The rule was simple: no more games."</em> <br>  <em>- Chris Crawford</em> <br><br>  Instead of creating games, Crawford began work on several entertainment and educational projects, including a simulator of an energy company called <em>Energy Czar</em> and a nuclear reactor simulator <em>SCRAM</em> .  His fellow programmers worked on accounting and business programs. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f56/84b/71d/f5684b71dabe38250bb5a826daaeb5e7.png" alt="image"><br>  <em>SCRAM</em> <br><br>  However, despite the desire of Atari to separate the line of computers from video games to become a serious competitor in the market, the company made one huge mistake that almost destroyed this idea: it released the game <em>Star Raiders</em> . <br><br>  The game, written by Doug Neubauer, was released in March 1980.  Atari hired Neubauer in 1979 as a chip design engineer, but he worked on the <em>Star Raiders</em> third-party project, developing the game on a wire-wrapped 8-bit prototype before models were ready for production.  <em>Star Raiders</em> was a 3D version of the game, very popular on college campuses and computer rooms in the 70s. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3ba/c3e/a63/3bac3ea63a7d0a61db4f5f10ac705d46.jpeg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Star raiders</i> <br><br>  <em>"</em> Star Raiders <em>was supposed to be a 3D version of the Star Trek game that was played on mainframes at the time. Star Trek was completely text-based and not real-time, but it contained concepts of damage to the ship, sector scanners and charts." .</em> <br>  <em>- Doug Neubauer</em> <br><br>  Three-dimensional graphics and gameplay <em>Star Raiders</em> did not resemble any previous game.  The finished product simply shook Neubauer's Atari colleagues. <br><br>  <em>‚ÄúThe company's employees were stunned by the game, which was the first real three-dimensional video game ... The visual effects were dazzling, especially the stars flying through the screen while accelerating, and four types of opponents appearing in front or behind.‚Äù</em> <br>  <em>- Michael Tomczyk</em> <br><br>  After the release of <em>Star Raiders</em> was the first "killer application" in computer games.  It was the first computer game that could be called a "car seller". <br><br>  <em>‚ÄúThe game was amazingly exciting.</em>  <em>I think it was the first game that combined action with a strategic screen.</em>  <em>Fortunately, this concept worked very well. ‚Äù</em> <br>  <em>- Doug Neubaur</em> <br><br>  Even the mainstream press has come down to the excitement of the game. <br><br>  <em>"</em> Star Raiders <em>is the most important game. This is the best combination of shooting gallery and planetarium. That is why I played it yesterday until one o'clock. It costs about $ 530, provided that you already have a color TV."</em> <br>  <em>- Henry Allen, Washington Post, September 2, 1980</em> <br><br>  Of course, the success of <em>Star Raiders</em> turned out to be a big hindrance to the Atari home computer department: he reinforced the misconception that 400 and 800 were not serious computers. <br><br>  <em>‚ÄúWho will buy a serious computer from the most successful video game and arcade company in the world?</em>  <em>Many customers thought that the Atari 400 and 800 were more expensive versions of the Atari 2600 video game machine. Some even doubted that the Atari 400 and 800 were real computers. ‚Äù</em> <br>  <em>- Michael Tomczyk</em> <br><br>  One of the main problems of Atari 8-bit computers was the prevailing stereotype about the lack of software for them.  Atari simply could not create enough products on its own, so that a relatively expensive computer purchase would be justified for someone other than keen gamers and game programmers. <br><br>  <em>‚ÄúUnfortunately, Atari prevented her own advantage.</em>  <em>To everyone's amazement, they decided to keep secret the basic technical information, such as memory allocation and bus architectures, which programmers need to write software.</em>  <em>They even attempted to blackmail programmers, saying that they could get technical information only if they signed an agreement to create software under the Atari brand.</em>  <em>This scared off an independent community of amateurs and programmers, and as a result, many serious programmers began to write software for other machines.</em>  <em>When Atari realized its mistake and started attracting programmers, it was already too late.</em>  <em>The only programmers loyal to her were game developers. ‚Äù</em> <br>  <em>- Michael Tomczyk</em> <br><br>  The internal development team continued to discuss the situation with third-party software, trying to convince management that it was making a mistake. <br><br>  <em>‚ÄúThe management attitude was:‚Äú We want to earn all the money for the software.</em>  <em>We don't need competitors. "</em>  <em>They had competitors for VCS and programmers tried to explain: ‚ÄúNo, things are not being done this way, you need a large library of programs, you need to attract creators,‚Äù and I was one of those who talked about this. ‚Äù</em> <br>  <em>- Chris Crawford</em> <br><br>  By the end of 1980, third-party software began to appear for 8-bit Atari computers.  Despite the fact that most of it was written in BASIC and had a text-based interface, for example, <em>Midway Campaign</em> and <em>Lords Of Karma</em> of Avalon Hill, many were still on the way. <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Despite Atari‚Äôs tremendous efforts to close the gaming capabilities of the computer, there were programmers, amateurs, hackers and coders who wrote quality games and brought them to the market. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">By the end of 1980, Atari had sold 35,000 computers, and by December sales had grown so much that the cars had to be divided into small lots and transferred to merchants throughout the country. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But even so, the computer business lost 10 million in sales of 10 million, forcing Atari to separate the computer department from the consumer equipment department in October so that it would not harm the huge success of VCS.</font></font><br><br><h1><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 1980: arcade machines </font></font></h1><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The Asari arcade business at the beginning of 1980 was still dominated by the </font></font><em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Asteroids</font></font></em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . It was created at least two versions of this machine, so that the game could fit in the halls, in which it was impossible to put a standard arcade machine. The "cocktail" version with a seat was released in April 1980. Machines of this version were sold about the same as other arcade machines sold (produced 8,725 devices and sold for $ 1,746 each). </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In addition, a new "cabaret" version was released in May.

New games were released almost every week, and the most successful added new interesting tasks and gameplay patterns. <br><br>  All this led to the fact that by 1981 the business of arcade machines grew into the world's largest entertainment market. <br><br>  <em>‚ÄúIt was a crazy, highly competitive business.</em>  <em>I participated in it when coin-operated automats earned $ 8 billion a year in quarters.</em>  <em>These games have surpassed the musical and film industries in terms of revenues combined, and this is at a quarter price! ‚Äù</em> <br>  <em>- Dan Pliskin (engineer of Atari arcade machines)</em> <br><br>  Arcade machines quickly spread beyond the gaming halls.  By the summer of 1981, in every fifth of approximately 40,000 minimarkets in the US, an arcade video game machine was installed, and many of them had Atari products. <br><br>  <em>"The players threw 10 million quarters into the</em> Asteroids <em>machine</em> <em>every day."</em> <br>  <em>- Frank Laney (Frank Laney Jr.) (Ernie Katz), Electronic Games magazine</em> <br><br>  After the success of <em>Asteroids</em> , <em>Missile Command</em> and <em>Battlezone</em> in 1980, the name Atari and the Fuji Mountain company logo became synonymous with quality gameplay.  The Atari arcade department entered in 1981, armed with new vector equipment developments and continuing to work on the design of games. <br><br>  However, the year began in the wrong direction, with a series of failed ideas and missed opportunities.  The first in March was <em>Asteroids Deluxe</em> - not a very good sequel to the most successful Atari game at that time. <br><br>  <em>"</em> Asteroids Deluxe was <em>done by Dave Shepherd. I didn‚Äôt put anything into the game, except the code for the first part with which he worked."</em> <br>  <em>- Ed Logg</em> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/da9/d76/842/da9d76842ba915f47efd4f5349fcfc5b.jpg"><br><br>  <em>Asteroids Deluxe</em> with its automatically shooting shields and killer satellites was too complicated and not good enough to outperform the original <em>Asteroids</em> game.  However, it was still selling well, it was shipped 22 thousand cars. <br><br>  <em>‚ÄúBut wait, is this approaching because of that big asteroid?‚Äù</em>  <em>This is a flying saucer zailorov, for which you were sent.</em>  <em>By dodging and maneuvering, you suddenly realized that they had become much smarter.</em>  <em>And this strange asteroid is chasing you?</em>  <em>Wait, this is not an asteroid!</em>  <em>This is a huge ship!</em>  <em>Ambush!"</em> <br>  <em>- Advertising</em> Asteroids Deluxe <br><br>  At about the same time, the first three-dimensional vector flight simulator Atari: <em>Red Baron</em> appeared in the arcade halls.  The game was a bit like the aviation version of <em>Battlezone</em> (in fact, the game was released in the body of the <em>Battlezone</em> machine gun), but with ground and air targets.  In total, 2 thousand machines were sold, the game did not become a big hit. <br><br>  Soon the next arcade game Atari suffered the same fate.  <em>Warlords</em> was a favorite, innovative <em>Breakout</em> style game that could be played by up to four players.  It was very interesting, but simply could not gather a mass audience to break through the flow of games of many other manufacturers, flooded the limited space of the gaming halls.  It sold only 2 thousand machines. <br><br>  This was unfortunate for the release of three undervalued games in a row.  By the middle of 1981, the competition for arcade machines was becoming increasingly fierce.  Atari had to contend with the hits of the golden era, set in all corners of the gambling halls.  Released in 1980, Namco's <em>Pac-Man</em> and Williams <em>Defender</em> captured the attention of the mainstream market, as it would later happen to <em>Ms.</em>  <em>Pac-Man</em> Namco. <br><br>  <em>Donkey Kong</em> Nintendo, <em>Galaga</em> Namco and <em>Frogger</em> Sega (licensed from Konami) captured attention in the second half of 1981.  These hit games attracted women ( <em>Pac-Man</em> , <em>Ms. Pac Man</em> , <em>Frogger</em> ) to the arcade halls, but also liked serious players ( <em>Defender</em> , <em>Galaga</em> ).  To stay in the game, Atari needed to find a new hit. <br><br>  However, she found two. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ec4/667/513/ec466751365734253875c013f67ebdd2.jpg"><br><br>  The first game was released in June, and had tremendous success.  <em>Centipede</em> was a garden "insect shooter" designed and written by Ed Logue and Dona Bailey (one of the first female developers of arcade machines).  There are some contradictions in the question of authorship of the idea. <br><br>  <em>‚ÄúThe idea of</em> Centipede <em>emerged as a result of one of the brainstorming sessions held annually by Atari.‚Äù</em> <br>  <em>- Ed Logg</em> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bfb/80c/a60/bfb80ca600e0d3fe865458a4ccab1c1e.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <em>Centipede</em> <br><br>  The playing field was a lawn with mushrooms.  To save the lawn, it was necessary to destroy centipedes, spiders and other garden insects.  Most of the mushrooms could be destroyed, which gave the game a sense of infinite possibilities, and also made it possible to create different strategies for setting records. <br><br>  <em>‚ÄúToday,</em> Centipede <em>would be considered, at best, a‚Äú casual ‚Äùgame, which makes me very happy, because it was not at all like that.</em>  <em>It was an active game with a story, although by modern standards there is no narrative at all!</em>  <em>I think today they wouldn't even let her out. ‚Äù</em> <br>  <em>- Dona Bailey</em> <br><br>  A total of 54,000 automata were sold, and for Atari the game was the second best selling ever.  In addition, it was very popular with women, which gave Atari an advantage due to the increase in the number of visitors to the arcade halls. <br><br>  <em>‚ÄúMany theories have been proposed.</em>  <em>One of them argued that the success of women game is obliged to a woman developer.</em>  <em>Another is that the destruction of insects is well suited to female psychology.</em>  <em>I think women like this game because it doesn‚Äôt discriminate on the basis of sex, like fighting games, RPGs or sports games. ‚Äù</em> <br>  <em>- Ed Logg on why Centipede liked women</em> <br><br>  The second major game for Atari in 1981 was <em>Tempest</em> .  Originally developed by <em>Missile Command</em> creator Dave Terehr as a 3D version of <em>Space Invaders</em> , it eventually became a three-dimensional battle around the boundaries of a constantly complicating geometric field. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e38/1e8/86f/e381e886f10af797a8927c3ce239253d.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <em>Tempest</em> <br><br>  <em>‚ÄúOnce I walked in and suddenly saw this round pipe with some things going up along it.</em>  <em>I asked: "Dave, what the hell is this?".</em>  <em>He replied: ‚ÄúI do not know myself.</em>  <em>Maybe aliens from the center of the earth? ‚ÄúIt seems he said that he had a dream like that.</em> <br><br>  <em>I asked: "How does it work?".</em>  <em>He answered: ‚ÄúI do not know.</em>  <em>They climb the edges of this thing, and I try to shoot them. "</em>  <em>He just started with this concept and gradually developed it.</em>  <em>I understand why he considers</em> Tempest <em>as his best achievement.</em>  <em>He worked incredibly hard on her.</em>  <em>It is completely a creation of his thought. ‚Äù</em> <br>  <em>- Rich Adam</em> <br><br>  The <em>Tempest</em> had a controller handle that moved the player‚Äôs ship along the boundary of each of the geometric levels.  It also used the latest Atari color vector generator (‚ÄúColor Quadrascan‚Äù) and the vector math box to create three-dimensional graphics that have never before been on arcade machines. <br><br>  The combination of great graphics, intense action and innovative design has created a terrific hit Atari.  The game was so hypnotic that some players entered a trans-like state without noticing anything around. <br><br>  <em>‚ÄúThe management at</em> Tempest <em>was good enough, having studied it, one could practically become one with the machine.</em>  <em>That is, a good player in</em> Tempest <em>turned the knob and fired at the right moment, synchronizing with the machine and getting into the rhythm.</em>  <em>I do not know what to call it, but the player was so close to the action on the screen that it became part of it.</em>  <em>He forgot about what is happening around and where he is. ‚Äù</em> <br>  <em>- Lyle Raines</em> <br><br>  Approximately 30 thousand <em>Tempest</em> machines were sold, only 8 thousand more than <em>Asteroids Deluxe</em> , but the most important advantage was not numbers, but popularity.  Thanks to <em>Tempest,</em> Atari looked like a company moving forward and not looking around for its old hits for inspiration. <br><br>  Teenagers and experienced players who grew up on <em>Pong</em> and <em>Space Invaders</em> , now craved a more complex and disturbing gameplay, and thanks to <em>Tempest</em> Atari met this demand. <br><br>  Along with the released games, in 1981, the Atari arcade department had several false starts and abandoned games, including <em>Force Field</em> , <em>Hyperspace</em> , <em>Space Shoot</em> (Howard Delman game), <em>Time Traveler,</em> and <em>Thogs</em> . <br><br>  Even with hits, in 1981, the Atari arcade machines did not go very well.  The founding engineer of all this work, El Elcorn, left the company after Atari failed to release the holographic electronic game <em>Cosmos</em> , on which he worked.  Despite the fact that Elcorn received thousands of orders at CES, Atari still decided not to release it, thus practically closing Atari Electronics. <br><br>  <em>"Ray Cassar was too afraid to tempt fate in the market of portable / board games, he believed only in the Atari 2600 VCS."</em> <br>  <em>- El Elcorn</em> <br><br>  Disappointment was unbearable for Elkorn.  1981 Atari ceased to be the company he helped create in 1972.  It is time to leave. <br><br>  <em>‚ÄúI left Atari because under Mr. Cassar‚Äôs guidance, she became uninteresting to me.‚Äù</em> <br>  <i>- El Elcorn</i> <br><br>  It was followed by other engineers.  The most painful loss was the departure of a trio of Ed Rotberg, Howard Delman and Roger Hector, who decided to create their own video game development company. <br><br>  <em>‚ÄúIn 1981, I, Roger Hector and Ed Rothberg left Atari and founded Videa, Inc.</em>  <em>We sought to become a respected developer in the video game industry, as well as in other markets in which we could use our skills.</em>  <em>As a result, we developed the arcade game</em> Gridlee <em>for Gottlieb, the</em> merchant <em>company ByVideo, and a couple of games for Atari VCS. ‚Äù</em> <br>  <em>- Howard Delman</em> <br><br>  Such losses had a bad effect on the morale of the arcade department and on its ability to create hit games.  However, Atari found a couple of ways to replace this brain drain, but not by hiring the best and smartest game designers. <br><br>  She began licensing games from other manufacturers.  Atari has always had close relationships with Namco, and in November 1981 they entered into an agreement to license several Namco arcade games for sale in the United States.  However, these games did not appear in the Atari production schedule until 1982. <br><br>  Another way was to use third-party software developers to create games.  In mid-1981, the opportunity to expand the arcade machine department by a third-party developer literally came into the hands of Atari itself. <br><br>  In June, a small company GCC (General Computer Corporation), assembled by MIT students, created for the Atari <em>Missile Command</em> arcade machine a ‚Äúmodification kit‚Äù called <em>Super Missile Attack</em> , and began selling it for $ 295.  The modification kit allowed game room operators to change the game, add options and make it more difficult for players. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7c1/063/65f/7c106365f2ffa26691f2a0b55a06c7a1.jpg"><br><br>  Atari found out about this bundle, and since it was in the legally ‚Äúgray‚Äù zone, the company was worried about its impact on the integrity of its products.  She filed a lawsuit in the amount of 15 million dollars against the GCC. <br><br>  <em>"The kit (General Computer modifications) was offered to our customers and the public as an Atari product, which caused confusion and loss of legitimate profits from our research and development investments."</em> <br>  <em>- Frank Baluz, vice president of marketing for Atari arcade machines</em> <br><br>  It turned out that GCC engineers have good skills in developing arcade games.  They created a modification kit for <em>Pac-Man</em> called <em>Crazy Otto</em> , which Namco sold.  He later turned into <em>Ms.</em>  <em>Pac-Man</em> . <br><br>  Atari could recognize talent.  The lawsuit never got to court, and Atari reached a peace agreement with the GCC. <br><br>  <em>‚ÄúThey were very annoyed that we were not retreating, and finally a light bulb lit up over their head:‚Äú GCC can develop games for us, ‚Äùso Atari withdrew its lawsuit ... We signed an agreement on developing games for Atari.‚Äù</em> <br>  <em>- Steve Golson (GCC engineer)</em> <br><br>  Atari signed a contract with GCC for the development of new arcade machines for the company.  GCC began work on <em>Quantum</em> arcade games, <em>Food Fight</em> and <em>Nightmare</em> (not released), VCS games such as <em>Ms.</em>  <em>Pac-Man</em> and <em>Vanguard</em> , on a new <em>Atari 7800</em> console project, as well as on some of the first games for the system. <br><br>  However, unlike Grass Valley a few years ago, GCC never integrated into Atari and obeyed instructions from people like Ray Cassar and Manny Gerard.  It seems that Atari's management was reinsured with respect to the development department.  If you can not find allies inside, you can always buy them outside. <br><br>  <em>"Our contract was not with Atari, we concluded it with Warner, who owned Atari ... Whatever we did, all these Atari guys had to put up with."</em> <br>  <em>- Steve Golson</em> <br><br><h1>  1981: computer business </h1><br>  Even despite the fact that Atari hid most of the technical documentation needed for third-party software development in the 8-bit computer line, the developers found their own resources for researching machines. <br><br>  Journals such as Compute began publishing articles about 400 and 800 back in January 1980.  They investigated the work of the machine and how to create software for it.  Some of the articles were written by Atari employees who desperately wanted the world to learn about their new cars. <br><br>  <em>‚ÄúAnyone who saw the</em> Star Raiders <em>at Atari knew that this personal computer has much better graphic capabilities than all the others.</em>  <em>Owners of these computers wondered if they could get their cars to do what</em> Star Raiders <em>was capable of</em> <em>.</em>  <em>The good news was that it was really possible to write programs with graphics and animation, as good as</em> Star Raiders <em>. ‚Äù</em> <br>  <em>- Chris Crawford, Compute's first Book Of Atari, 1981</em> <br><br>  Even better news for owners of Atari computers was the release in January of the first specialized magazine ANALOG on 8-bit Atari machines.  Thanks to ANALOG, Atari owners have an independent news source that can bring the platform closer to computer fans ... <br><br>  <em>‚ÄúAtari is also a popular computer of the eighties.</em>  <em>At the January Consumer Electronics Show in</em> <em>Las Vegas, the</em> <em>most frequently asked questions were: ‚ÄúWhat is the best restaurant here, how to get to the toilets and where is the ATARI stand?‚Äù "</em> <br>  <em>- The first issue of the journal ANALOG</em> <br><br>  ... and double the pressure on Atari and computer stores to support the platform. <br><br>  <em>‚ÄúCompared even with the 400 color, the TRS-80 looks like a joke.</em>  <em>APPLE II technologies are archaic compared to the 800, and no other microcomputer on the market can compete with the computing power of Atari.</em>  <em>Many computer stores do not acquire 400 and 800 ... "there is no software for them," but we at the ANALOG office receive programs and new products almost every day, and we don‚Äôt have time to review them all.</em>  <em>I am very impressed with the amount of really good software that has appeared in just a year. ‚Äù</em> <br>  <em>- The first issue of the magazine ANALOG</em> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4f8/d9b/772/4f8d9b7721365b544bf22e48976f97f4.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  One of the reasons for the emergence of a specialized magazine was a significant increase in computer sales in the late 1980s and early 1981s. <br><br>  <em>‚ÄúWe were told that Atari sales are increasing, and this is not just a gradual increase that we have seen since summer.</em>  <em>The stream has definitely turned into a river, it seems that the conveyor does not have time to produce computers: in mid-December, merchants across the country were selling cars faster than buying them. ‚Äù</em> <br>  <em>- Robert Lock (Robert Lock), Compute !, February 1981</em> <br><br>  However, much of this was made possible thanks to the cult status of <em>Star Raiders</em> .  Atari computers provided graphics and gameplay, far superior to everything that was previously, and hardcore gamers bought them just to play games. <br><br>  <em>"If you have an Atari 800 computer, do not forget - there are other game cartridges besides</em> Star Raiders <em>"</em> <br>  <em>- Robert Baker, Compute !, April 1981</em> <br><br>  Even despite Atari‚Äôs desire to prove that its machines are capable of more than games, the company in 1981 began to release its games again, including an almost perfect copy of the <em>Missile Command</em> arcade game, surprisingly low-quality <em>Asteroids</em> (with raster graphics) and decent <em>Super Breakout</em> , as well as two educational games by Chris Crawford, <em>Energy Czar</em> and <em>SCRAM</em> . <br><br>  Atari still complemented these games with a bunch of serious software (Conversational Spanish, Bond Analysis, Stock Analysis, Stock Charting, Mailing List, Touch Typing, Calculator, Graph It), but whether she wanted to or not, it was the games that became the lure for new users. <br><br>  The unique idea of ‚Äã‚ÄãAtari of that time, which allowed supporting the 8-bit platform even more, was the APX software, the Atari Program Exchange.  APX became the brainchild of Dale Yocam.  The idea was to take the best samples of software created by the Atari user community and sell them to users. <br><br>  <em>‚ÄúDale Yokam, who came up with this idea, tried to explain to management that there are many people ready to write programs, and if we can publish them, it will be beneficial for both parties.</em>  <em>The manual is not very interested.</em>  <em>Dale prepared a business plan and said: "Look, we need quite a bit of money for this, the system will support itself, and it can also bring profit."</em>  <em>The management very reluctantly agreed.</em>  <em>He realized his idea and very quickly she received a huge success.</em>  <em>She became the main source of income Atari.</em>  <em>The management "awarded" Dale with inviting another person to the position of his boss.</em>  <em>Frustrated, Dale retired about a year later. ‚Äù</em> <br>  <em>- Chris Crawford</em> <br><br>  It is interesting to note that APX has become a resource not only for Atari customers.  Many VCS internal development staff wrote games like APX <em>Lemonade Stand</em> , <em>Mugwump</em> , <em>Preschool Games</em> , <em>Reversi</em> , <em>Space Trek</em> and <em>Dice Poker</em> were written by Bob Polaro.  <em>Avalanche</em> and <em>Chinese Puzzle</em> created by Dennis Coble.  <em>Centurion</em> , <em>Castle</em> , <em>Alien Egg</em> and <em>Tact Trek was</em> written by Rob Zdibel.  <em>Lookahead was</em> created by Bob Johnson (Bob Johnson), and <em>Load N 'Go</em> - Brad Stewart. <br><br>  However, the most popular game created by the Atari programmer for APX was the <em>Eastern Front (1941) of</em> Chris Crawford, released in September 1981.  <em>Eastern Front (1941)</em> was a tactical wargame simulating a battle between German and Soviet troops in World War II. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/aa6/137/e60/aa6137e6049de0fd9d211bea6483a59f.png" alt="image"><br>  <em>Eastern Front (1941)</em> <br><br>  Unlike other tactical wargames of the time, <em>Eastern Front</em> boasted color graphics and joystick controls, which completely simplified the game's interface.  Although there were no animated battles in the <em>Eastern Front</em> , it was a cinematic masterpiece compared to text games Avalon Hill.  The gameplay was also interesting. <br><br>  <em>‚ÄúWithout doubting for a second, I will call this game one of the best wargames for a personal computer.</em> <em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In addition, it has become a masterly demonstration of Atari‚Äôs amazing built-in capabilities. ‚Äù </font></font></em> <br> <em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Creative Computing</font></font></em> <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Thanks to such games, Chris Crawford seemed (almost) the only one who was able to simultaneously tell the world about the capabilities of Atari 8-bit computers and show the magic that can be created in them. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Sales were good too. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Even with a share of royalties of 10%, Crawford earned $ 90,000 on this game. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Immediately began to appear games and applications from third-party sources. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">One of the best games of the </font></font><em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Caverns of Mars</font></font></em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">was created by high school student Greg Christensen. He sent it to APX, and the game sold very well. It was a multi-level vertical scrolling shooter. The player was deep under the surface of Mars, fought with aliens, until they reached the center of the planet. The game used the capabilities of Atari 8-bit computers in much the same way as </font></font><em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Star Raiders</font></font></em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . </font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/73d/bdd/c4d/73dbddc4d43029c09c08f9c6f2977d1b.jpg" alt="image"><br> <em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Caverns of Mars.</font></font></em> <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Christensen's game won a prize of 3 thousand dollars from Atari and the first check for royalties of 18 thousand. He received a total of 100 thousand dollars for the game as royalties. In 1982, Atari turned it into a line of computer games. Christensen continued his successful career as a game developer and released two </font></font><em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Caverns of Mars</font></font></em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> sequels </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">: </font></font><em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Phobos</font></font></em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">and </font></font><em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Caverns of Mars II</font></font></em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">During 1981, more and more third-party developers learned to program Atari computers and release software. Where did they learn the technical information necessary for programming the machine, which they kept in secret? From insiders from Atari, such as Chris Crawford.</font></font><br><br> <em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúInitially, no one specified exactly what should be kept secret. I was an Atari programmer who came from the outside world and had more contacts with outsiders. Sometimes it happened that I was working on Atari software, a phone call rang and someone from Indiana asked: ‚ÄúCan I get technical documentation?‚Äù. I went to the main office, took away the documents, photocopied them and sent them by mail ... there were many tricks by which I could send the documents and not be dismissed. ‚Äù </font></font></em> <br> <em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Chris Crawford</font></font></em> <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> During the year, quality games from the largest software companies of that era began to appear. In March, Automated Simulations (Epyx) released its first three games for 8-bit Atari computers: </font></font><em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The Datestones of Ryn</font></font></em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> , </font></font><em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Rescue at Rigel,</font></font></em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> and</font></font><em>Invasion Orion</em> .

Dozens of other games from small producers (including from the ANALOG magazine itself) and amateur programmers were released. </font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8c7/baf/96a/8c7baf96af996936bca1126c90c94d5d.jpg" alt="image"><br> <em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Rescue At Rigel</font></font></em> <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> To further stimulate new developers, the Atari home computer department created a new Software Support Group that was supposed to help developers from other platforms work on software for Atari 8-bit computers.</font></font><br><br> <em>¬´        .      . ,     :       .       ,  ,       Atari.       .    .

The Atari development team (with the participation of Chris Crawford) has published (via APX) the book De Re Atari. It contained most of the technical details needed to develop software using all the functions of the 8-bit Atari platform. Later, in 1982, finally released a full set of technical documentation. </font></font><br><br> <em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúI sent to developers any insignificant information, and once‚Äú the dam broke through, ‚Äùthe official policy changed and turned around 180 degrees.

Commodore already had PET on the market before the 400 and 800 appeared, and the company announced the release of the VIC-20, a more powerful computer than the standard Atari 400, but with a much lower price of $ 299. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Atari responded in May, lowering the price of the Atari 400 to $ 399 and doubling the amount of memory, from 8 KB to 16 KB. The plan worked, and sales of Atari computers skyrocketed throughout the year. </font></font><br><br> <em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúThey still sell them as fast as they produce.

In addition, it allowed to convey to consumers a sort of message: although there are other systems on the market, such as Intellivision, only Atari VCS can you play real arcade games. However, if </font></font><em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Missile Command</font></font></em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> simply conveyed this message, then another very significant game of the year for VCS, </font></font><em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Asteroids,</font></font></em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> announced it loudly </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">To place the arcade game </font></font><em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Asteroids</font></font></em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> in the cartridge volume was not so easy. This task was assigned to Brad Stewart, a </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">VCS </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">version of </font></font><em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Breakout</font></font></em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> , and it turned out to be difficult. To fit all the graphics and gameplay </font></font><em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Asteroids</font></font></em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A standard 2 KB cartridge was impossible. In fact, the game wouldn't fit even in a 4 KB cartridge. </font></font><br><br> <em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚Äú</font></font></em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Asteroids </font></font><em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">needed 8k. When the game was over, Bob Smith and I used all the tricks we knew to fit it into 4K, but it ... just ... didn't ... fit! ‚Äù </font></font></em> <br> <i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Brad Stewart</font></font></i> <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> To get access to 8K, Stewart used a newly developed scheme under The name ‚Äúbank switching‚Äù (originally invented for the VCS </font></font><em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Basic Programming</font></font></em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> cartridge </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">). It allowed the programmer to access several 4K banks of memory. For VCS, this was a breakthrough.</font></font><br><br> <em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúThe proposed invention creates a memory with bank switching and a way to increase the number of individual addresses that a digital system can access. The invention extends the available memory beyond standard addressing, in which one memory cell is associated with a unique address. In particular, the invention is used to expand the number of ROM memory addresses stored in the game cartridge of a video game system without requiring additional address trunks. " </font></font></em> <br> <em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Carl Neilson (Carl J. Neilson), patent for a memory system with switchable banks, registered on May 7, 1981.</font></font></em> <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Switching banks opened a completely new world of clearer and more elaborate graphics for VCS. It allowed to realize </font></font><em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Asteroids</font></font></em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">on VCS, which in turn turned the Atari VCS into a compulsory Christmas present for 1981. </font></font><br><br> <em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúYou will not find the best electronic toy in the toy department.

She shook the air the largest television and newspaper campaign in the history of the company.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In total, Atari spent $ 18 million on television advertising in 1981, almost tripling the 1980 record. For the massive Christmas of 1981, Atari put everything on the line. She even forced retailers to order large quantities of games that they would otherwise not have bought, ‚Äúto the load‚Äù to popular Atari products. </font></font><br><br> <em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúAtari has enjoyed its dominance over the years for distributors to operate.
