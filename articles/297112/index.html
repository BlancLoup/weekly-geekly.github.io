Send resumes everywhere (many, many)</b> </h4><br><h6>  If it seems to you that every second job is right for you, then you are wrong.  Spray, of course, can be any number.  But why do you need it?  The chances of this do not increase, because you spend time irrationally.  It would be better to have conducted a study and identified two among the ten favorite jobs.  Or three. <br>  It is necessary to adjust the resume for each employer, as well as to write a covering letter.  It's also great if you explore corporate culture and look for suitable values ‚Äã‚Äãfor yourself, and not convulsively press the ‚ÄúSend‚Äù button every 10 minutes. <br>  It is even worse if you saw several vacancies suitable for you in one company, and immediately a resume was sent to each of the specified addresses three times.  By this you simply told your future employer that you do not know yourself what you want.

      <b>Quality, not quantity</b> <br>  No, just imagine that you decided to throw tangerines (well, soon the New Year).  What is the probability that throwing 10 tangerines at the same time into the basket will get you?  Throw one at a time - or rather it will be. <br>  And it is better to just make a short-list of companies in which you would like to work, and maybe it will be more convenient for you to indicate the specific position that you would like to take.  If you do not specifically decide, you will confuse grapefruits, oranges, lemons and tangerines.  And throw them all into the trash. </h6><br><br><h4>  <b>2. You need to send a resume urgently ASAP RIGHT NOW</b> </h4><br><h6>  You are so well done and created your list of dream companies.  And one of them publishes a vacancy, from which your heart beats rapidly.  And you start writing a letter quickly, sculpt a resume and you think that you need to send a resume right now, today, otherwise tomorrow they will find a suitable candidate and you will miss the opportunity.  Of course, there is truth in your thoughts.  But still know that you have a few days.  They will be useful to you, do not rush to make a decision right away, try to get the most complete picture of the company, vacancies, prospects and about yourself ‚Äî all this is simply necessary if you want to stand out among the candidates who ‚Äújust sent a resume‚Äù. <br><br>  <b>Give yourself a day</b> <br>  Right here, sit down for two hours.  Only you and your resume.  Nothing more.  And start exploring the situation: who is needed?  why are you coming?  How would you like to develop in the company?  Why is this area so interesting for you?  Do you have a story you can tell? <br>  The person who sent his resume and was in the top ten / hundred, will not have any privileges.  Remember this, agreed? </h6><br><br><h4>  <b>3. You need to send your resume to everyone who is related to your dream company.</b> </h4><br><h6>  You have mastered the science of networking ( <a href="http://icanchoose.ru/blog/8-mifov-o-netvorkinge/">and if not, here is our material to help you</a> ) and even met someone who works in a company that you like.  It's straight cool, great!  But suddenly stunned a person with whom you recently met with a message like ‚ÄúHere is my resume!‚Äù. <br>  First of all, why spoil relations with a person so immediately?  :) <br>  Secondly, why do you think that he wants to help you - maybe it is worth discussing with him in person?  Or at least call before throwing all your career prospects at him? <br>  Thirdly, it is still worth a professional approach to the issue - first of all you must be a professional, and then just a pleasant person who you can take to the team. <br><br>  <b>Make friends, but do not overdo it.</b> <br>  Ask for advice - these are people willing to share.  And it will be much more useful to you.  Ask about how best to approach the HR department, who you can personally write and so on. </h6><br><br><h4>  <b>4. Send a pathetic letter and resume to a position for which you do not have enough experience.</b> </h4><br><h6>  There are situations when fanfare does not change the situation.  And this is the case.  It is not necessary to describe how much you like the company, if it is obvious that as long as you do not pull this position.  This is a bit humiliating and will not allow you to use this chance again if a suitable vacancy appears. <br>  However, there is a difference between the ‚Äúposition I will ever borrow‚Äù and ‚ÄúI do not hold out a bit‚Äù.  We told you that sometimes you may suddenly discover that you are qualified enough for this job.  In general, try to approach rationally. <br><br>  <b>Do not waste your strength in vain</b> <br>  It is not harmful to dream, it is harmful to spend your emotions on what you should not spend on them.  The disappointment that covers you when you are not answered is comparable to defeat, so just don't let yourself get upset if it's not worth it.  Be prudent. </h6><br>  <a href="http://icanchoose.ru/blog/kak-sozdat-chelovechnoe-rezyume/">Remember that your resume must be human</a> .  This is really very important. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/297112/">https://habr.com/ru/post/297112/</a></p>
