KickBrick competitors</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d48/3c2/9fd/d483c29fd0274ddbbe47ee270bec40fc.png"><br><p><br>  The story of the development of the gadget for shock sports manager of the most middle managers.  Under the cat analysis of the market for martial arts trackers and a summary of the progress in the development of KickBrick. </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/195/bfb/94f/195bfb94f53041f7970f5d58be365b78.jpg" alt="image"><br><p><br>  After the publication of the last post, I received a lot of letters with offers of assistance.  Thank! </p><a name="habracut"></a><br><p>  It turned out to be quite difficult to find fitness trackers for percussion martial arts, especially a comparative review.  I considered 5 gadgets: Corner, Hykso, Moov, Striketec, SportSense.  If you have information about any other martial arts gadgets, please write to me. </p><br><h3>  Corner </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fff/822/c3a/fff822c3ab41403481c29c414a871fcd.jpg"><br><p><br>  The device was presented at the London's Wearable Technology Show 2016. Athletech, a UK start-up, states that their gadget is the first system in the world that is completely ready for use by athletes at various levels and is able to determine the strength, speed and accuracy of the strike. </p><br><p>  The system is based on the performance of a 3-axis accelerometer.  The gadget is fixed on the arm.  All readings in real time are displayed on the screen of the device associated with the gadget.  This device is exactly the activity tracker in its pure form, since it only reflects your activity, without introducing a significant innovation into the training process. </p><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LdYBVoEFauA" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><p>  Pre-order is available at a discount of 40% - ¬£ 79.99 (6,100 rubles.) </p><br><h3>  Hykso </h3><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/916/279/09f/91627909f309466598b7564d7e2a86c7.jpeg"></div><br><p>  The <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/medgadgets/blog/271704/">Hykso</a> gadget is much like the Corner.  The gadget is also mounted on the hands under the bandages. </p><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5OkNvEWkQQY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><p>  The system consists of small sensors and a mobile application, which in real-time monitors all the important indicators - the number of strikes delivered per battle, their speed, intensity, and so on. </p><br><p>  An important difference is gamification and the overall rating, which can be displayed on the monitor.  During group training, the rating system is an additional incentive for athletes and amateurs to give their best during the training session.  In the US, more than 6 gyms are already equipped with these systems. </p><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6H4JdR3dPKQ" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><p>  The cost of a set of two sensors is $ 249.95. </p><br><h3>  Mooo </h3><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fe1/e4e/e85/fe1e4ee85f5b4456be9d45fac8316b78.png"></div><br><p>  Fitness tracker Moov is a multifunctional tracker of various activities.  Information is collected from the accelerometer, gyroscope and magnetometer. </p><br><p>  Acting as a digital personal trainer, Moov can analyze your activities.  In this case, the gadget understands what exactly you do: running, weightlifting, boxing, swimming, cycling, boxing and much more, providing real-time audio advice and feedback.  This is a significant difference Moov from other trackers.  You do not just get information about what you have already done, with you a coach who tells you what to do next and forces you to do another round or another approach ... just one more time. </p><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/00pa676oiOg" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><p>  <b><a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/medgadgets/blog/262080/">Moov</a> technical specifications</b> </p><br><ul><li>  Water and dust protection </li><li>  Strap: removable, 2 colors are available to choose from (black and white, depending on the color of the device itself) </li><li>  Compatibility: Android 4.3 devices with Bluetooth 4.0 LE, iPhone 4s and newer, iPad 3 and newer, all iPad mini and fifth generation iPod touch </li><li>  Connection: Bluetooth 4.0 LE </li><li>  Sensors: nine axis motion sensor </li><li>  Indication: color lights </li><li>  Battery: up to 100 hours </li><li>  Weight 25 g </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bc8/830/6c6/bc88306c65b448bf93519653296eaee7.jpg"><br><p>  The essence of the training comes down to the fact that on the screen of a smartphone or tablet we see something like a treadmill going off into the distance, and circles appear on the left and right on it.  When approaching two static circles corresponding to your fists, they must be ‚Äústruck‚Äù with blows.  The stronger and more accurate the blow (accuracy is determined by hitting the center of a moving circle and by how much you hit it in time), the more points you get. </p><br><p>  <b>Cost: 5.000 rubles.</b>  <b>in Russia, $ 59 on Amazon</b> </p><br><h4>  Striketec </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ced/666/0c8/ced6660c85da4e7390219208cd686da1.jpg"><br><p>  This device is in many ways similar to Corner and Hykso, while the significant difference is the ability to use the option for wrapping in bandages, and the version on the bracelet.  The developers have focused on the spamming gamification, this makes the broadcast of fights more spectacular, and the training process is quite interesting for subsequent analysis of behavior in the ring. </p><br><p>  In several publications it is mentioned that this gadget has successfully passed a crowdfunding campaign.  In fact, on Indiegogo I did not find information about this project, and on Kickstarter this project <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1334413244/striketec-wearable-fitness-technology-for-boxing">closed</a> with the amount of 1% of the required.  It may well have been used later another site, but I did not find information about this. </p><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/isyuqHmIi_c" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><p>  The BTLE information is transmitted in real time to the paired device to display and save information about the training process or the fight. </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/36d/569/664/36d5696646f04880a6a49fd4530dded6.jpg"><br><p>  Since 2014, information on the development of the project has not yet appeared, most likely Striketec has not received funding and proper development. </p><br><h3>  Sportsense </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b71/2ff/454/b712ff4540b340c5bcc4beb1a71294fd.jpg"><br><p>  This system is a Russian development.  SportSense consists of two sensors, with one mounted on the wrist, the other on the belt of the athlete.  The system registers the speed, strength and type of impact.  Data is transmitted to the device to view information about each beat and the progress of training. </p><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1eEIxYsH6tY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><p>  An interesting experience of cooperation SportSense with Reebok.  It is safe to conclude that it is not the readings themselves that are interesting, in kg or parrots, the comparison with the readings of other athletes and the rating system are interesting. </p><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MfIsa5lcEvA" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><h3>  comparison table </h3><br><table><thead><tr><th>  Device </th><th>  Information on-line </th><th>  Gamification </th><th>  Tips </th><th>  Crepe </th><th>  Price </th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>  Corner </td><td>  Yes </td><td>  Not </td><td>  Not </td><td>  Arm </td><td>  6.100 rub. </td></tr><tr><td>  Hykso </td><td>  Yes </td><td>  Yes </td><td>  Not </td><td>  Arm </td><td>  15.600 rub. </td></tr><tr><td>  Mooo </td><td>  Yes </td><td>  Not </td><td>  Yes </td><td>  Arm </td><td>  5.000 rub. </td></tr><tr><td>  Striketec </td><td>  Yes </td><td>  Yes </td><td>  Not </td><td>  Arm </td><td>  - </td></tr><tr><td>  Sportsense </td><td>  Yes </td><td>  Not </td><td>  Not </td><td>  Arm </td><td>  - </td></tr></tbody></table><br><p>  Existing fitness trackers are not suitable for training without a trainer, as only the information is displayed.  We are planning to create an ecosystem in the center of which will be our device.  On our resource, coaches will place sports programs to train certain strokes or combinations.  Users will be able to purchase from the application their favorite sports programs, which consist of video instructions and a training script.  After watching the video, the user turns on the gadget, hangs on the bag and starts training on the projectile, while receiving voice commands about what kind of punch you need to make and what you should fix.  The social component of the application allows you to post brutal photos with workout metadata to all social networks.  This will form a stable ecostructure around the software and hardware complex and will give a commercial advantage in the future. </p><br><h3>  [Made in GeekTimes] KickBrick </h3><br><p>  Printed the first version of the case for the version of the pear (bag).  In the future, we will make a master model and the test batch will be poured into silicone. </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c17/88f/52b/c1788f52b40a4500a83404dee9d73726.jpg"><br><p> A clear conclusion from the comparative table is the need to manufacture a wrist version.  All the work on design, modeling and design was done by <a href="https://geektimes.ru/users/nikitakhvoryk/" class="user_link">NikitaKhvoryk</a> .  The entire electronic filling will completely duplicate the versions for the bag with the exception of devices indicating the need for an impact. </p><br><p>  <b>Sketches version for the wrist</b> </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f19/288/b37/f19288b3751140a2843d64a02e7db92c.jpg"><br><p>  We consulted and decided to choose the concept number 3. </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a0b/cce/119/a0bcce1191e94f75a75ee38819adc0ea.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/007/68b/8be/00768b8bee4247069834652948a02aff.jpg"><br><p>  <b>In the meantime, we are going to us 3 options boards.</b>  <b>They are coming, and we are all waiting for:</b> </p><br><ul><li>  board for arduino pro and ready-made modules </li><li>  board for atmega32 </li><li>  board for stm32 </li></ul><br><p>  <b>We are preparing the first version of the application for mvp</b> </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/718/266/2c7/7182662c762844a0aca662e30f440f5b.jpg"><br><p>  <b>In the future, we plan to add the ability to:</b> </p><br><ol><li>  Scorbord.  Comparison with friends, overall rating </li><li>  Comic achievements.  They really motivate and lure.  An example of titles that you need to try to earn: "Blow the thugs from a nearby bar", "Almost a fighter of MMA", "You have to go to the UFC". </li><li>  Music under the rhythm of training. </li><li>  Tips for improving data based on sensor readings. </li><li>  Synchronization with popular programs counting calories, and other information </li></ol><br><p>  We also plan to make the paws, which fix the time from the coach‚Äôs ‚Äúlifting on the kick‚Äù, before the kick with the transfer of all data to the information board.  In the future, the application will support third-party bracelets, adjusted for their functionality.  All this will allow to carry out trainings more effectively and safely. </p><br><h3>  If you are ready to help </h3><br><p>  From each batch of ordered boards, 7-8 will remain unused in the testing process.  If you want to get one of them, just email me hp and in social networks. <br>  If you are ready to help with the development of the application, your help is very necessary. <br>  If you are an investor, philanthropist, philanthropist or avid backer - I am open to dialogue. <br>  If you want to design a version on another hardware: intel, cortex, baikal ... I'm waiting for your messages </p><br><p>  <a href="https://geektimes.ru/users/webzuweb/topics/">Post 2</a> , <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/279986/">Post 1</a> </p></div>
