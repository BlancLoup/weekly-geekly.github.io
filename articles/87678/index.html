This thing was created a few months and is now turning indicators 6000-12000 sites daily. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b2c/008/69b/b2c00869bf0baa328cbfde3fdc764431.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  Frankly speaking, the very idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe project is not very unique, but I tried to take not an idea, but a relatively large number of functions (including unique ones) and quality of implementation.  The beta version was created for about 3 months, but the whole thing will be finalized for the next six months (at least).  Several dozens of American IPs ‚Äúwork‚Äù on the subject; if necessary, I increase their number.  What is interesting - the number of pages in Google - one is displayed from the American IP, and another from the Russian.  Therefore, I plan to connect and Russian IP.

      The purpose of this review will be to clarify the following questions - ‚Äúhow convenient?‚Äù, ‚ÄúWhat is missing?‚Äù And ‚Äúcrooked somewhere?‚Äù. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Overall, the development process was pretty routine.  As you understand, to check information from third-party resources like search engines, directories, statistics, etc.  - you need to adjust the parser for each, then test for a long time.  If a third-party resource is changing something in terms of structure, it is necessary to redo the parser.  For example, the Alexa service has already changed the principle of issuing the Alexa Rank indicator, and Technorati has completely disabled its Rank. <br><br>  It was developed (by <a href="http://samborsky.com/">Evgeny Samborsky</a> ) all on CodeIgniter using the MVC pattern, quite convenient and effective.  There are all sorts of trendy pieces like transfer tabs - like shortcuts on the desktop. <br><br>  The purpose of the panel is to combine site statistics from everywhere.  For example, satellite grid owners and optimizers have a need to constantly monitor various information from Yandex.Webmasters and Sape Exchange, where there is no sensible history of changes in the number of backlinks and increase / decrease in spending on website promotion.  Now we are just completing this, we want to meet this need.  And for the sake of password security of users on the same Sape, this information is immediately sent encrypted to a third-party hidden server - on which there is nothing more. <br><br>  In addition, there will soon be a paid function for the sake of automating the process (yes, you need to pay for the project, while advertising in it is not for sale).  Daily automatic update.  This is for lazy + too busy + for vacation. <br><br>  I will explain in steps - what to do to check the site / sites in the panel.  Let's say registered.  Immediately after registration, you must get into this interface (clickable): <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d24/c82/046/d24c8204636a60cd8d66e137842fed22.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  What's next? <br><br>  Step <b>1</b> .  Create a tab by clicking on the "+".  The trick is that for each tab you can set your preferences, which site indicators should be defined in the ‚Äúmy sites‚Äù tab, and which ones in ‚Äúmy clients‚Äù or ‚Äúmy satellites‚Äù should be decided by you.  If the tab that by default (‚Äúmy sites‚Äù) is enough, then go ahead. <br><br>  Step <b>2</b> .  Customize tab.  Being in the right tab, click on "customize tab."  Will appear: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/970/d46/cf4/970d46cf437d0e20957ed107026d6a79.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  So, what is there.  There are all indicators of sites / domains that the socket can identify.  To each his own.  Activate what you need.  Notice that the ‚Äúabbreviation‚Äù column allows you to select what you want to display in reduced mode, and what, respectively, in full.  For example, maybe once a week you need to check only the most-needed parameters, and once a month there are others. <br><br>  Suppose you activated the following options: <br><br>  TCI (by the way, in the case of an update TCI, new results are recorded instantly); <br>  Yandex.Catalog (presence in it); <br>  PR (PageRank); <br>  Alexa Rank; <br>  LI (LiveInternet counter) + LI.Hosts per day (attendance per day); <br>  Memori (how many social bookmarks saved on the site); <br>  Tweets (how many links from Twitter to the site); <br>  Page size; <br>  Domain age (how many days is the domain); <br>  Approved on News2 (how many news from the site approved on news2.ru); <br>  Employment (employment of the site name in 7 popular domain zones). <br><br>  Step <b>3</b> .  Adding a site / sites to the desired tab.  You can add one site at a time, and you can immediately several tens or hundreds through the mass addition.  Let's say you decided not to add your sites, but for the sake of interest 3DNews.ru, iXBT.com, CNews.ru, Ferra.ru, Computerra.ru.  Get this picture (clickable): <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b2c/008/69b/b2c00869bf0baa328cbfde3fdc764431.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  You can update the result once a day.  As I have already said, in the future it will be possible to set up auto-update on a schedule, as well as the absence of a limit on the number of checks of the same per day. <br><br>  What else can the panel?  I will list the main: <br><br>  - Sort sites by decreasing / increasing the value of a certain indicator (such as doing TOP); <br>  - export result to Excel; <br>  - history of changes in indicators; <br>  - the average result of the indicator for the sites (this is seen in the screenshot); <br>  - create a button with a TCI and / or PR under the site, for placement anywhere; <br>  - create an informer with website indicators, which is much better than a button ( <a href="http://maulnet.ru/archives/10009">more</a> ). <br><br>  <a href="http://maulnet.ru/tools/registration">Sign up</a> . <br><br>  PS I recommend not to click on the shard! <br><br>  PS2.  What is the registration for?  In order to preserve the history of checking indicators.  The subject is designed (first of all) for those who constantly monitor the performance of the necessary sites. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/87678/">https://habr.com/ru/post/87678/</a></p>
