  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Tablet Overview</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <em>Hello.</em>  <em>This topic will focus on the choice of such a thing as a tablet.</em>  <em>Below you will find short reviews, specifications and prices for tablets from manufacturers such as <strong>Wacom</strong> , <strong>Genius</strong> and <strong>Hanvon</strong> .</em>  <em>The following models will be considered - <strong>Wacom Bamboo Fun</strong> , <strong>Wacom Intuos3</strong> , <strong>Genius G-pen m712</strong> and <strong>m609</strong> , <strong>Hanvon Art Master</strong> , <strong>Hanvon GraphicPal</strong> .</em> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Introduction </h2><br>  I am a novice designer.  Not so long ago, I was excited to buy a tablet for myself, and then I began to look closely at tablets from different manufacturers and choose. <br><br>  To begin, I'll tell you what criteria will be used to evaluate and compare tablets: <br><ul><li>  the size of the active surface is directly the area that is sensitive to the pen; </li><li>  tablet resolution (number of lines per inch) - characterizes the sensitivity of the tablet to the movement of the pen; </li><li>  the number of sensitivity levels when the pen is pressed on the tablet; </li><li>  sensitivity to the angle of inclination of the pen and to the rotation of the pen; </li><li>  the presence of auxiliary keys and other input tools; </li><li>  the presence of a battery in the stylus (re). </li></ul><br>  And so, let's proceed directly to the review. <br><br><h2>  Wacom </h2><br>  No one doubts that <a title="Section with tablets on the official website" href="http://www.wacom.com/index2.php">Wacom</a> is the market leader in tablet makers.  Their tablets are considered the best and as a result the most expensive.  Tablets from Wacom are represented by such lines: <strong>Bamboo</strong> , <strong>Bamboo Fun</strong> , <strong>Intuos3</strong> , <strong>Cintiq 12WX</strong> and <strong>Cintiq 21UX</strong> .  Wacom Bamboo will not be reviewed in this review, as  It is hardly suitable for design purposes (positioned as a business model).  Cintiq12WX and Cintiq21UX will also not be considered because of their high prices - these are tablet displays (the cost on the official website: Cintiq12WX is $ 999, Cintiq21UX is $ 1999).

      <br>
      It should be noted that the Bamboo Fun and Intuos3 tablets come with a wireless mouse. <br><br><h3>  Wacom Bamboo Fun </h3><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img alt="Wacom Bamboo Fun" src="http://www.wacom.com/lightbox/images/bambooFun_1.jpg"></div><br>  <a href="http://www.wacom.com/bambootablet/bamboofun.php"><em>Tablet page on the official site</em></a> . <br>  Although this model is not positioned by the firm as a professional, it seems to me that it should be given attention.  The model is presented in two sizes (meaning the size of the active surface) - Small (5.8 "x 3.7", A6) and Medium (8.5 "x 5.3", A5).  As for me, the A6 is not enough, so I would not buy a tablet of this size.  Also presented are different colors of the model - white, gray, blue, black.  The tablet comes with a stylus, a stand for the stylus, a mouse, CDs with software, 3 interchangeable tips for the stylus. <br><br>  Specifications: <br><ul><li>  <strong>Levels of sensitivity when pressed:</strong> 512; </li><li>  <strong>Resolution:</strong> 2540 lines per inch; </li><li>  <strong>Input:</strong> 4 programmable express keys, touch circle. </li></ul><br>  The cost on the official website: Small - $ 99, Medium - $ 199. <br><br>  <strong>Advantages:</strong> to be honest, it's hard for me to find any.  Bamboo Fun Samll has a relatively small price, but for designers it will probably be too small.  The advantages include the fact that, like the other tablets from Wacom, does not have a battery in the stylus. <br>  <strong>Disadvantages: a</strong> rather low level of sensitivity of the pen, and a weak resolution of the tablet.  It is not sensitive to tilt and rotation of the pen.  Bamboo Fun Small is small, Bamboo Fun Medium is expensive for a tablet of this class. <br><br><h3>  Wacom Intuos3 </h3><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img alt="Wacom Intuos3" src="http://www.wacom.com/lightbox/images/intuos3_6x8_1.jpg"></div><br>  <a href="http://www.wacom.com/intuos/index.php"><em>Tablet page on the official site</em></a> . <br>  This is the best tablet presented in this review (and as a result the most expensive).  Intuos3 is a professional tablet for designers, artists, people working with advanced graphic editors, 3D visualization software, etc.  They are sold in 6 sizes - 4 "x 6" (A6), 6 "x 8" (A5), 6 "x 11" (A5 wide), 9 "x 12" (A4), 12 "x 12" , 12 "x 19" (A3).  Included with the tablet is a five-button wireless <strong>battery</strong> - <strong>free</strong> mouse, a stylus, a stylus stand, 2 tips for a stylus with different textures, 3 spare ordinary tips, a CD with software. <br><br>  Specifications: <br><ul><li>  <strong>Levels of sensitivity when pressed:</strong> 1024; </li><li>  <strong>Resolution:</strong> 5080 lines per inch; </li><li>  <strong>Input:</strong> all tablets have 4 programmable keys and a touch strip on both sides (except for a 4 by 6 inch tablet that has these keys and a strip on one side only). </li><li>  <strong>Pen tilt sensitivity:</strong> ¬± 60 ¬∞. </li></ul><br>  The cost of the official website: <br><ul><li>  4 "x 6" - $ 219; </li><li>  6 "x 8" - $ 329; </li><li>  6 "x 11" - $ 369; </li><li>  9 "x 12" - $ 449; </li><li>  12 "x 12" - $ 529; </li><li>  12 "x 19" - $ 749. </li></ul><br><br>  <strong>Advantages:</strong> what can I say, Intuos3 is the best tablets.  High sensitivity to pressure, high resolution of the tablet, sensitivity to the angle of inclination of the pen and to its rotation, the pen works without a battery.  It was a great surprise for me that the <strong>mouse also works without a battery</strong> .  The back of the stylus also has a sensitive tip (1024 levels of pressure sensitivity), which can be used as an eraser.  Included are 5 additional tips for the pen. <br>  <strong>Disadvantages:</strong> high price.  In Russia and Ukraine, the prices for Intuos3 tablets are at least <strong>one and a half times</strong> higher than the prices presented on the official website.  For me personally, buying this tablet at home is out of the question, because of the very high price.  You have to look in the direction of eBay, where you can buy Wacom Intuos3 6 "x 8" for about $ 320, Intuos3 4 "x 6" for about $ 240 (the price includes delivery). <br><br><h2>  Genius G-pen m712 and m609 </h2><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img alt="Genius G-pen m712" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/52c/a54/895/52ca54895c011ff8d0b93c9227ee1df1.jpg"></div><br>  <em>Tablet pages on the official website: <a href="http://www.geniusnet.com/geniusOnline/online.portal%3F_nfpb%3Dtrue%26productPortlet_actionOverride%3D%252Fportlets%252FproductArea%252Fcategory%252FqueryPro%26_windowLabel%3DproductPortlet%26productPortletproductId%3D672182%26_pageLabel%3DproductPage%26test%3Dportlet-action">Genius G-pen m712</a> and <a href="http://www.geniusnet.com/geniusOnline/online.portal%3F_nfpb%3Dtrue%26productPortlet_actionOverride%3D%252Fportlets%252FproductArea%252Fcategory%252FqueryPro%26_windowLabel%3DproductPortlet%26productPortletproductId%3D672242%26_pageLabel%3DproductPage%26test%3Dportlet-action">Genius G-pen m609</a></em> . <br>  Genius is not very famous for its tablets.  In any case, in the market of professional tablets, Genius is not a serious player.  G-pen m712 and G-pen m609 tablets are the most advanced of all Genius tablets.  They have the same characteristics except for the size (and due to the size a different number of hot keys).  The G-pen m712 has an active surface size of 12 "x 7" and the G-pen m609 has a size of 9 "x 5.5".  Included with the tablet are the stylus, the stylus holder, spare tips for the pen (how many are not specified), the refill tweezer (could not translate) and the battery for the AAA stylus. <br><br>  Specifications: <br><ul><li>  <strong>Levels of sensitivity when pressed:</strong> 1024; </li><li>  <strong>Resolution:</strong> 4000 lines per inch; </li><li>  <strong>Input:</strong> 5 hard buttons on the top of the tablet, one rotating disk in the top corners of the tablet, 34 macro keys for the m712 (26 for the m609). </li></ul><br><br>  <strong>Advantages: the</strong> main advantage of this tablet is its price.  In the Russian online stores G-pen m712 can be purchased for approximately 7300 rubles.  (in Ukrainian for about 1300 UAH.).  As it was written in one foreign review of this tablet: "For 25% of the cost of Wacom Intous3, you get 90% of its functionality."  Of course, one can argue with these figures, but in comparison with the price-quality ratio, the G-pen clearly wins over the Wacom Intuos3.  And with Wacom Bamboo Fun, he wins both in price and performance. <br>  <strong>Disadvantages: the</strong> stylus has a battery (finger).  Rumor has it that the stylus is not very comfortable shape, too big and inconvenient.  Unlike the Wacom Intous3, the stylus has only one active end.  No sensitivity to the angle of the stylus and to its rotation.  The resolution is 1000 units lower than Intuos3, but I can‚Äôt judge if you can really feel the difference while working.  I also read that some people had problems with the drivers for this tablet, which is why it didn‚Äôt work as it should (I don‚Äôt know if this is a pressing issue at the moment).  Well, that seems to be all. <br><br><h2>  Hanvon art master </h2><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img alt="Hanvon art master" src="http://www.hanvon.com/images/product/pic_am0605.jpg"></div><br>  <a href="http://www.hanvon.com/products/PenTablet%26Display/ArtMaster-0806.html"><em>Tablet page on the official site</em></a> . <br>  This is a very mysterious tablet.  I have a strong opinion that it is almost impossible to buy this tablet model from the company Hanvon :).  In runet there is no mention of Hanvon Art Master.  I would generally doubt its existence if I had not stumbled upon this <a href="http://cgi.ebay.com.au/HANVON-Graphic-Tablet-ArtMaster8x6,-BatteryFree-5080lpi_W0QQitemZ250376929267QQcmdZViewItemQQimsxZ20090221%3FIMSfp%3DTL090221175001r13433">tablet on eBay</a> (there a model of 6 "x 8" in size costs about $ 230).  According to the characteristics - this is a complete clone of Wacom Intuos3.  Please note - not the image of the stylus of this tablet is the same as that of Wacom Intuos3.  Only the appearance of the tablet itself is different.  The tablet has four buttons and a touch strip.  And the rest seems to be the same as that of the Intuos3: 5080 lines per inch, 1024 levels of sensitivity of the pen, pen battery-free, sensitivity to tilt, etc.  If someone has more detailed information about this tablet, then please dissuade me that this tablet has nothing to do with Intuos3 :). <br><br>  Hanvon Art Master tablets come in five sizes: 12 "x 9", 11 "x 7", 8 "x 6", 6 "x 5", 5 "x 4". <br><br><h2>  Hanvon GraphicPal </h2><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img alt="Hanvon GraphicPal" src="http://www.hanvon.com/images/product/pic_gp0806.jpg"></div><br>  <a href="http://www.hanvon.com/products/PenTablet%26Display/GraphicsTablet-0806.html"><em>Tablet page on the official site</em></a> . <br>  Also a mysterious character.  There is no mention of him in runet.  In foreign online stores you can buy, but for some reason, the characteristics on the official site do not correspond to those listed in online stores and other sites where you can buy this tablet.  The tablet comes in three sizes: 8 "x 6", 6 "x 5" and 5 "x 4". <br><br>  Characteristics from the official site: <br><ul><li>  <strong>Levels of sensitivity when pressed:</strong> 1024; </li><li>  <strong>Resolution:</strong> 4000 lines per inch; </li><li>  <strong>Input: there are no</strong> buttons for input on the tablet. </li><li>  <strong>Sensitivity to pen angle:</strong> ¬± 60 ¬∞; </li></ul><br><br>  In all other sources stated that the tablet has a resolution of 2540 lines per inch and 512 levels of sensitivity when you press the pen.  The pen does not have a battery.  A 8 "x 6" tablet abroad can be ordered starting at $ 100 (excluding shipping costs).  Honestly, I find it difficult to compare this tablet with the others due to the fact that I don‚Äôt know its characteristics, but if the official website doesn‚Äôt lie, then this is a pretty good tablet for that amount.  Otherwise, it can only be with Wacom Bamboo Fun. <br><br>  PS By the time I finished the article, I could not resist and decided to buy Wacom Intuos3 on eBay.  Won an auction for a brand new, fully equipped, packed 8 inch by 6 inch tablet.  The auction was won with a bid of $ 212.5 plus $ 51.5 for delivery to Ukraine (a total of $ 264 - the price for this tablet is very low!).  Waiting for when it comes and I hope that the box will actually be Wacom Intuos3 :). <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/52029/">https://habr.com/ru/post/52029/</a></p>
