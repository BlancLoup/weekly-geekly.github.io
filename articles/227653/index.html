  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Start of construction in the village of programmers</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The idea to build a cottage settlement for remote workers in the outback has finally reached the construction stage.  We did not manage to get land from the administration and investments from developers, so we bought the land and started building the infrastructure with our own money. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  The essence of the idea </h4><br>  Living in a modern Russian city is a dubious pleasure.  In an ordinary Russian village, all the more.  And moving abroad "with the ends" is suitable only if you are ready to give up the Russian mentality and to talk to your children in Thai before the end of your life. <br><br>  Therefore, the idea arose to make a cottage village in the nature, ‚Äúsharpened‚Äù for remote workers - with all the necessary infrastructure and adequate prices.  More information about the concept of the village can be read <a href="http://poselok-programmistov.ru/">on our website</a> .

      Just want to make a reservation that we did not focus on proximity to Moscow.  Life in such a village is suitable only for those who have really moved to a remote place and are not dependent on regular work meetings. <br><br>  Initially, we planned to agree on the allocation of land with the local administration, and about investments - with some developer or venture capital fund, but we failed.  Having ceased to run with the presentation on different offices, it was possible to concentrate on the main work and earn money for the land and the initial development. <br><br><h4>  Land </h4><br>  As a result, we bought a small plot of 17 hectares in a couple of kilometers from the town of Slobodskoy, Kirov region.  It is a glade on the shore of Skokovsky pond, surrounded on three sides by a pine forest, on the fourth - limited by a coastline.  All photos can be viewed <a href="http://instagram.com/it_poselok">in our Instagram</a> , and the location of the site - <a href="http://goo.gl/3alOrU">on Google Maps</a> . <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c9c/3da/0a1/c9c3da0a1d65db264cbbb31be4aa5c8c.jpg" alt="View from the site to the pond"></div><br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/420/cd0/7d5/420cd07d5d99cddf28cd17c01751514a.jpg" alt="View from the site to the pond"></div><br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/041/1c4/a16/0411c4a16bf0818865ecdf74fedf1720.jpg" alt="View of the plot from the pond"></div><br><br>  When planning, we wanted to keep the shape of the horseshoe as much as possible, which the plot suggests.  The result was 60 residential plots of 12 acres and three large public areas.  The site has a <a href="http://poselok-programmistov.ru/">detailed description of the layout</a> . <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0d0/556/ab0/0d0556ab0ee20e73bb80b33302ef37db.png"></div><br><br>  These plots will be sold at cost (cost of land + communications, divided by the number of plots).  The price will include road access, water supply, sewage, electricity and wired internet.  The exact cost price will be known closer to the beginning of sales, while we can only orient - something around 150-200 tr.  for the plot. <br><br>  The plots will be sold only with a contract - with the purchase you will have to choose a house project and pay for the first stage of construction work. <br><br><h4>  Construction site </h4><br>  Construction will be carried out by our construction company.  The proposed technology is a frame with a mineral wool as a heater.  The whole village will be in the same architectural style, but each house will be made on an individual project. <br><br>  We are building a construction company from scratch - now we are just getting used to each other on the mini-hotel project and infrastructure for a large subsidiary project - IT camping.  The preliminary price we hope to offer is from 15 to 20 tr.  per sq.m.  in a state of "fine finish".  This price is due to cheap lumber (Kirov region - the largest supplier of wood) and the low level of margins, which we lay in the company. <br><br><h4>  IT camping </h4><br>  To make a decision whether our housing offer suits you or not, it would be nice to live a week or two on the spot in human terms and calmly weigh the pros and cons.  To do this, we are building several mini-hotels, a small cafe on the site, and we carry out Internet there. <br><br>  In addition to ‚Äúfitting‚Äù housing, this project is an opportunity to break out of Moscow for a week with the whole family, live in nature, and at the same time not spend vacation at work ‚Äî there will be full Internet access in the camp. <br><br>  As an architectural prototype for a mini-hotel, we took the structure of the <a href="https://www.google.ru/search%3Fq%3Dcamping%2Bpods">camping pod</a> , greatly increased it and adapted it to our conditions.  Now the first "number" in the stage of construction.  Here is what it looks like at the moment: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e4e/74b/87e/e4e74b87ec8036577f8184f5eddac4f3.jpg"></div><br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/051/d7c/2f4/051d7c2f41b3ecad716210097a076d2c.jpg"></div><br><br>  By the way, the semicircular roof offers significant advantages - saving construction materials, simplifying the process and better thermal insulation.  If the end result is really worthy in terms of quality and price, we can offer this technology for the construction of individual residential houses. <br><br><h4>  Startup accelerator. </h4><br>  It seems to us that IT camping in nature is a great opportunity for some startup accelerator.  Most accelerators work with start-ups with short intensive sessions - and we suggest holding these sessions in the field format.  This will save money and increase the productivity of startups. <br><table><tbody><tr><th>  Office rent in Moscow </th><th>  Camping with us </th></tr><tr><td>  Startups at home are distracted by common household problems. </td><td>  Hotel option domestic problems eliminates </td></tr><tr><td>  Startups spend time in traffic jams </td><td>  Office near the hotel </td></tr><tr><td>  They breathe exhaust, wither and faint. </td><td>  After work - fresh air, beach, forest walks </td></tr><tr><td>  Worth a lot of money </td><td>  Double room just 5000r per week. </td></tr></tbody></table><br>  At the moment we are looking for an accelerator who is interested in such an opportunity.  In the case of successful negotiations, we will be able to quickly scale up and accept dozens of startup teams and mentors. <br><br><h4>  Dates and contacts </h4><br>  Now we have a land survey procedure, until the end of which we cannot sell plots even under a preliminary contract.  According to the plan, the survey should be completed by mid-July.  A full launch of IT Camping is planned for next year. <br><br>  To make a preliminary application for housing or contact us, <a href="http://poselok-programmistov.ru/">fill out the contact form</a> on the site.  We also recommend to subscribe to our <a href="https://twitter.com/it_poselok">twitter</a> and <a href="http://instagram.com/it_poselok">instagram</a> <br><br><h4>  Answers to the most frequently asked questions </h4><br><ul><li>  The medicine.  The village is 5 minutes drive from the town of Slobodskoy with the central regional hospital and an hour‚Äôs drive from Kirov, a city with a bunch of clinics, a new perinatal center and dozens of commercial medical centers. </li><li>  School and kindergarten.  The answer is similar to the question of medicine with one small exception - in the very near future we would like to make a school and a kindergarten in the village itself. </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/227653/">https://habr.com/ru/post/227653/</a></p>
