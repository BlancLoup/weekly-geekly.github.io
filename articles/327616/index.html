  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Extrasensory ability in design, which I have lost</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Imagine: you wrote a program and present it in the office of the customer.  You worked a lot on it, overcame the problems that were not obvious at first glance, met all the limitations and technical requirements.  And you, with excitement and pride, launch the program, the main menu appears.  You are already ready to show functionality, when suddenly you hear that someone passing through the office said: "I would write in another language."  In my head flashes: "What?  What was it?!  Does anyone know what language my program is written in?  Are there programmers in this office?  Fuh, no, it probably seemed. "  Throwing away the silly thoughts you are preparing to start a presentation, when suddenly someone from the audience leans towards the monitor and clearly says: "This program will not work, it is full of bugs."  You are shocked - you have to be a genius to make such a conclusion from the first screen.  Another viewer is less restrained: ‚ÄúWell, and g * clearly.  Couldn't do something normal? ".  Viewers say you are in a panic.  When someone passing through the office says: ‚ÄúThe code should be more native,‚Äù you immediately run up to it with the question: ‚ÄúAre you a developer?‚Äù.  He replies: ‚ÄúNo, I'm doing repairs in this office.‚Äù  Obviously - either the world has gone mad, or you are surrounded by geniuses who see much more than you. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I design all my life.  At first he did it himself, then he opened a logo design company, began to systematize knowledge and write about design.  Every day I look through hundreds of logos, read books on the subject, try to distinguish truth from nonsense, and make notes.  Many designers at this stage are starting to make a cosmic neo-revolutionary NLP-design that only their colleagues understand - I am not one of these guys.  I want the design to have more specifics and less hoaxes. <br><br>  An example, which the developers will forgive me, I gave at the beginning, looks ridiculous.  People who do not know the problem and are not even interested in programming, make far-reaching conclusions and give thoughtful advice.  But this is exactly what happens in the design. <br><br>  You don‚Äôt need to go far - I saw a comment on the logo on Habr√©: ‚Äúthey would do something recognizable‚Äù  Oh god  I would give a lot to be able to immediately determine the degree of recognition of the logo and improve it, without getting up from behind the computer.  But recognition is not something that is embedded in the logo from birth.  We will recognize the green mermaid with its legs ... hmm ... tails, if we show it at every corner.  If I knew how to feel recognizable as this commentator, I would make each logo 100% recognizable, not otherwise.

      "This is a bad logo."  "This is a good logo."  "This design is not worth so much."  "The logo should be remembered, recognizable and beautiful, but what is this?"  There are plenty of such comments under any design news.  So I see an ad: ‚Äúan expert in design will diagnose on one glance‚Äù.  I envy such abilities - I do not know how. <br><br>  Do not misunderstand me - I do not urge anyone who has no relation to design to shut up, not at all!  On the contrary, the more opinions about design will be around, the clearer it will be how it is perceived.  But I am opposed to the taste served under the guise of knowledge.  There is a design with frankly bad graphics, noticeable to everyone - an unreadable font is not planned to spoil the perception exactly.  For deeper conclusions about the schedule you need to spend years on the development of artistic taste.  But in order to draw conclusions about recognizability, memorability, success, failure or cost of a design at first glance, one must be a genius, not otherwise.  As Paul Rand said, design becomes design only during use.  And looking at the design can only honestly say "I like" or "I do not like." <br><br>  I hope I managed to give a fairly vivid and understandable example.  And if someone really feels the degree of recognition and the exact cost of design - write, I have a lot of work for you! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/327616/">https://habr.com/ru/post/327616/</a></p>
