  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Leaked data - who is to blame? Perhaps so conceived</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Today at 9:30 the call to the mobile <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/micro/" class="user_link">MICRO</a> , called it by name and asked: " <i>Is it true that you have achieved success in the last 2-3 years?</i> ".  At 10 I got a call with the same question.  I had a little more patience (and interest in what was happening), so, unlike the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/micro/" class="user_link">MICRO</a> , I did not immediately get angry, but decided to find out what they wanted from me. <br>  To the question about where my name and telephone number are from, I was told that I was registered on their website (a specific, unknown to me site was named).  When I said that I didn‚Äôt know anything about their website, they asked me: ‚Äú <i>And you don‚Äôt know anything about the 20th of December?</i> ‚Äù  I showed no interest.  Meanwhile, on the site you can read that even some ministries of the Russian Federation participate in the organization of the propiar event, among others. <br><br><h4>  And now attention, the question is: where did they get the ‚Äúphone number + name‚Äù bundle? </h4><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5d9/ab7/38f/5d9ab738f317ad8396b5a1d2ce49f9dc.jpg" width="249" height="300" align="right"><br>  There are two links between me and <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/micro/" class="user_link">MICRO</a> : it is a university and a job.  It is unlikely that the company scattered such data.  Yes, and the university is no need.  <b>It turns out, the data from social networks</b> .  But at least my page is closed.  <b>More suspicious operators.</b>  But we have different telecom operators, so this option seems to me unlikely. <br><br>  <b>In any case, the conclusion suggests itself that some structures have enough karma to view inaccessible data by simple metric ones.</b>

    <h4>  In the comments I propose to unsubscribe to those who have received a similar call in recent days in order to draw joint conclusions about the source of information about us. </h4>  And there we will decide whether to fall into paranoia or not :) <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <u>UPD 13:10</u> : one more person to whom called was responded.  Now three have one coincidence: university.  Comments from him: <i>This is the only number registered to me, but I rarely use it (only outside Moscow).</i>  <i>It should not be on the Internet at all, as in the dean's office.</i> <br>  <u>UPD 14:37</u> : +1 people from my university <s>, +1 people from another university</s> . <br>  <u>UPD 15:01</u> : the only person at the moment from another university has been deleted from the list: other people called him for other reasons. <br>  <u>UPD 15:27</u> : +2 people from the same university. <br>  <b>The current data on the connection between the phoned around: 6 people, all students of the same university, everything is VKontakte.</b> <br>  There is a <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/infosecurity/77500/">version</a> that the data are ‚Äúmerged‚Äù by a university employee.  <s>Not yet confirmed.</s>  <s>There is an argument against: one of those who are ringing around claims that his number is not only in the university, but in general, on the Internet is not "lit up."</s> <br>  There is no longer any argument against this version: it was the ‚Äúmerged‚Äù number that was called from this number. <br><h4>  The investigation is over.  The data were issued by a university employee.
