Mavic 2 Pro - the world's first copter with an integrated camera Hasselblad and Mavic 2 Zoom - the world's first folding copter with optical zoom.  News created yesterday was largely written "on emotion," so now it's time to look at it in a little more detail and describe its functions and capabilities. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f8d/7c5/4ae/f8d7c54aeed5367d6cfdfd421cc9207a.jpg" alt="image"><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <a href="https://coptertime.ru/catalog/dji-mavic-2/"><b>DJI Mavic 2</b> - the most advanced DJI copter</a> ever produced, designed for professionals - photographers, cameramen and other creative people.  Based on the design of the world's most popular Mavic Pro copter, Mavic 2 has a powerful platform with a new, stabilized camera and advanced shooting features such as Hyperlapse and ActiveTrack for easier and more dynamic shooting.  Impressive flight time - up to 31 minutes and more advanced video transmission system Mavic 2 allows you to get great shots with unsurpassed convenience and stability ... <br><br>  ‚ÄúTwo years ago, when the first Mavic Pro appeared, it forced users to reconsider their view of the copters and expand the possibilities of shooting people around the world,‚Äù said Roger Luo, president of DJI. ‚ÄúToday we are entering a new era of aerial photography with the flagship Mavic 2 series ‚ÄúMavic 2 Pro and Mavic 2 Zoom will allow photographers and operators to raise their inspiration into the air quickly and bring their creative ideas to new heights.‚Äù <br><br>  <a href="https://coptertime.ru/catalog/dji-mavic-2/dji-mavic-2-pro/">Mavic 2 Pro: Superior Hasselblad Image Quality</a>

      <b>A camera</b> produced in partnership with <b>Hasselblad</b> , the leader in medium format photography, Mavic 2 Pro is the first quadcopter with an integrated Hasselblad camera to take photos of superb quality and color. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c2b/a23/013/c2ba230137ec7e07c9c4e382f6b42244.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>The 1 "CMOS matrix</b> has a 10bit Dlog-M color profile. This camera is capable of recording 4 times more color gradations per channel than the Mavic PRO camera, providing maximum processing flexibility and the amount of data received. Mavic 2 Pro allows you to get 20 megapixel photos with believable colors, using Hasselblad's unique technology (Hasselblad Natural Color Solution (HNCS), besides allowing you to adjust the aperture in the f / 2.8-f / 11 range to work under different lighting conditions. With support for 4K 10-bit HDR, Mavic 2 Pro can be connected  n to the 4K TV c HLG enabled to view material with realistic color display. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/715/0b9/c4a/7150b9c4a23fb8dc74b290a2025667ec.gif" alt="image"></div><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c37/d27/474/c37d274744710d1230dd94b948b57232.gif" alt="image"></div><br>  <a href="https://coptertime.ru/catalog/dji-mavic-2/dji-mavic-2-zoom/">Mavic 2 Zoom: Dynamic perspective due to optical and digital zoom.</a> <br><br>  Equipped with a 1 / 2.3 "matrix, the Mavic 2 Zoom is the first <b>DJI</b> consumer <b>copter with an optical zoom camera</b> to dynamically change the focal length for more creative shots. With the <a href="https://coptertime.ru/catalog/dji-mavic-2/dji-mavic-2-zoom/">Mavic 2 Zoom,</a> you can show an object closer by combining the optical and digital zoom. 96mm focal length equivalent, shooting video without loss in quality with resolution up to 1080r. Hybrid autofocus of the new camera combines phase and contrast methods, which is 40 percent faster than before.Photography is done with a resolution of 12MPi  with or in the new regime "super resolution", which uses optical zoom for automatic recording and gluing 48mp images inside the copter, which is ideal for landscape photography. <br><br>  Exclusive feature Mavic 2 Zoom - <b>Dolly Zoom</b> (sometimes called Transtrav) - a new feature previously available only to professional operators.  This function creates a changing perspective with automatic zooming and flying away from the object, while maintaining the same object scale in the frame. <br><br>  The Mavic 2 series is a new DJI flagship with powerful camera capabilities. <br><br>  Both cameras shoot 4K video with the highest details with a bit rate of 100 Mb / s and using the H.265 codec to ensure the highest quality during post-processing. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/181/e09/c36/181e09c36fbb74cc3fbd6636565b7c03.gif" alt="image"></div><br>  For photographers, new possibilities of expanding the dynamic range have appeared - shooting and stitching together several frames without ‚Äúphantoms‚Äù.  In the version of Mavic 2 Pro, this allows you to get a range of up to 14 steps, and in a Mavic 2 Zoom up to 13 steps. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/90a/582/2ba/90a5822baefcdcce196fc3ea041bb4ed.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>New tools for cinematic frames.</b> <br><br>  Mavic 2 is a great tool for producing aero-content with the help of new flight modes that make it possible to get professional results almost without effort.  New feature - Hyperlapse allows you to get video with the effect of accelerated time and immediately send it to the social network.  JPEG and RAW photos will also be saved to the SD card or built-in storage, leaving the possibility of post-processing.  The choice between the ‚Äúcircle‚Äù or ‚Äúfixing the course‚Äù, ‚Äúpoint flight‚Äù or ‚Äúfree mode‚Äù modes will allow you to create timelapse by simply pressing a button in DJI Go 4. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/29d/08f/bcb/29d08fbcb98ef6a6153bb8ed242988c6.gif" alt="image"></div><br>  <b>Free</b> - control the copter manually while shooting a Hyperlapse video. <br><br>  <b>Circle</b> - automatic flight in a circle with the choice of the object around which the shooting is conducted. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9e5/a07/953/9e5a07953b642f8440f103a4c80195c5.gif" alt="image"></div><br>  <b>Course Lock</b> - fixes the camera on the selected object, while allowing the copter to fly in any direction. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f2d/eba/83b/f2deba83bcf32722f99d42967593dcb0.gif" alt="image"></div><br>  <b>Waypoint</b> - plan your flight using altitude and GPS coordinates. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/21b/b21/09c/21bb2109cb9658bd09e32829136366df.gif" alt="image"></div><br>  Holding an object in the frame is now even easier with the new ActiveTrack 2.0 system.  This is an improved version of tracking an object thanks to a combination of sensors previously not used on DJI copters.  I use the main camera and 2 additional Mavic 2 creates a three-dimensional map of the space in front of you and 3 seconds ahead.  Following the object, the system analyzes the movement and predicts the trajectory, while not forgetting to avoid obstacles on the way.  The system also does not lose the object even if it hides for some time from the frame after another object and can follow it at a speed of up to 72 km / h. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/483/e91/037/483e910377818a3924f519aa4aed4098.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Safer, smarter, more stable</b> <br><br>  Mavic 2 has an updated autonomous flight system.  which transmits more data to a more powerful processor for a more accurate and accurate flyby of obstacles.  Now, as many as 10 sensors ensure the safety of flight from almost all sides.  The extended APAS system allows you not only to analyze the obstacles and stop, and fly around them.  In addition, a backlight is provided on the bottom of the case for an accurate fit in low light conditions. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5e3/398/ba7/5e3398ba7e67fa4b14ed3bb02c213d5e.gif" alt="image"></div><br>  <b>The updated OcuSync 2.0 system</b> supports 2 frequencies - 2.4 and 5.8 GHz and allows you to control and receive video with a resolution up to 1080p at a distance of up to 8km, and also to save everything that is shot directly into the memory of a smartphone with a resolution up to 1080p and photos in JPEG with original resolution. <br><br>  <b>Aerodynamic design and increased flight time.</b> <br><br>  The new copters have an updated hull, which is 19 percent less windy than the Mavic Pro, thanks to which the speed can reach 72km / h, and the flight time now reaches 31 minutes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/846/fdf/afa/846fdfafa872d44353e3f74d0aeca08c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  To get clear photos and video without jitter, Mavic 2 received a new ultra-accurate three-axis mechanical suspension, which provides stabilization of the camera even with very fast movement.  Photos and videos can be saved not only to an external microSD card, but also to the built-in 8GB of memory. <br><br>  The redesigned control panel also got removable sticks like for Mavic Air for easy storage and more convenient carrying. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d58/b31/a92/d58b31a928cd8c593c88de18ebb04c5e.jpg" alt="image"><br>  DJI Mavic 2 has also, like the previous version, <b>compatibility with <a href="https://coptertime.ru/catalog/dji-goggles/dji-goggles/">DJI Goggles</a> glasses</b> , as well as the ability to control the camera position by turning the head in the range of -75 ¬∞ - + 75 ¬∞ along the YAW axis. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/421213/">https://habr.com/ru/post/421213/</a></p>
