The main goal of the project is to create rules for vulnerabilities that are widespread and high level of danger (high impact).  The repository contains files for integration with <a href="http://oinkmaster.sourceforge.net/">oinkmaster</a> - a script for updating and deploying rules in the specified IDS.  And for the test of the rules themselves are attached pcap-files with traffic.  It is worth noting that the repository has already scored over 100 additions to favorites, and over the year added about 40 new vulnerabilities, including BadTunnel, ETERNALBLUE, ImageTragick, EPICBANANA, SambaCry.  All announcements about new threats are published on <a href="https://twitter.com/attackdetection">Twitter</a> . </p><br><h3 id="positive-js">  Positive JS </h3><br><p>  The tooling development community (primarily the web) used in PT products. </p><br><h3 id="libprotection">  Libprotection </h3><br><p>  An organization that brings together members of the Positive Development User Group community, <br>  working on LibProtection library implementations for various languages ‚Äã‚Äãand platforms. <br>  This library provides developers with a secure string handling facility. <br>  and takes over the entire routine of sanitizing input data and automated protection <br>  applications from injection attacks.  In more detail the principles of work and functional <br>  LibProtection opportunities were described in Vladimir Kochetkov's report <a href="https://assets.contentful.com/9n3x4rtjlya6/3TBySNqcnKC4ASYkacY6Cy/98e0b6379de9176d8c116a5a825ad7de/Vladimir_Kochetkov.pdf">‚ÄúWinning injections‚Äù</a> . </p><br><h2 id="proekty">  Projects </h2><br><h3 id="ptpmhttpsgithubcompositivetechnologiesptpm">  <a href="">PT.PM</a> </h3><br><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/web/ea0/a08/bf2/ea0a08bf26a345999aed3cd448c481f6.png" alt="PT.PM Logo" hspace="15"><br><p>  <strong>PT Pattern Matching Engine</strong> is a universal signature code analyzer that accepts custom patterns that are described in a special language as input.  This engine is used in a free tool for checking web applications for the presence of vulnerable components of <strong><a href="https://approof.ptsecurity.ru/">Approof</a></strong> , as well as in the source analyzer <strong><a href="https://www.ptsecurity.com/ru-ru/products/ai/">PT Application Inspector</a></strong> . </p><br><br><p>  The analysis process consists of several stages: </p><br><ol><li>  Parsing source code to parse tree. </li><li>  Convert a tree into a unified format. </li><li>  Map the tree with custom patterns. </li></ol><br><p>  The approach implemented in the project makes it possible to unify the task of developing templates for different languages. </p><br><p>  PT.PM introduces continuous integration, supports building and testing project modules for both Windows and Linux (Mono).  The development process is organized using tagged tasks (Issues) and pull requests.  Along with the development, the project <a href="https://github.com/PositiveTechnologies/PT.PM/wiki">documentation</a> is maintained, and the results of all significant assemblies are published in the format of both <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/PT.PM/">NuGet</a> packages and ‚Äúraw‚Äù <a href="https://ci.appveyor.com/project/KvanTTT/pt-pm/build/artifacts">artifacts</a> .  The organization of PT.PM can probably be considered exemplary, to which I would like to strive for in all other projects. </p><br><p>  For the first stage, namely, source code parsing, ANTLR based parsers are used.  This tool generates them for various languages ‚Äã‚Äã(runtimes) based on formal grammars for which there is a repository.  Our company is actively developing it.  Currently, generation under Java, C #, Python 2 and 3, JavaScript, C ++, Go, and Swift is supported, with support for the last three added recently. </p><br><p>  It is worth noting that ANTLR is used not only in the PT projects of the Application Security direction, but also in <strong><a href="https://www.ptsecurity.com/ru-ru/products/mpsiem/">Max Patrol SIEM</a></strong> : there it is used to process the DSL (Domain Specific Language) language, which is used to describe dynamic asset groups.  The exchange of experience in this area made it possible not to waste time on tasks that have already been solved earlier. </p><br><h3 id="grammatiki-antlrhttpsgithubcomantlrgrammars-v4">  <a href="https://github.com/antlr/grammars-v4">Grammar ANTLR</a> </h3><br><p>  With the participation of Positive Technologies, grammars for PL / SQL, T-SQL, MySQL, PHP, Java 8 and C # have been developed and improved. </p><br><h4 id="plsqlhttpsgithubcomantlrgrammars-v4treemasterplsql">  <a href="https://github.com/antlr/grammars-v4/tree/master/plsql">PL / SQL</a> </h4><br><p>  SQL grammar have extensive syntax with lots of keywords.  Fortunately, the PL / SQL grammar existed under ANTLR 3 and porting it under ANTLR 4 was not very difficult. </p><br><h4 id="t-sqlhttpsgithubcomantlrgrammars-v4treemastertsql">  <a href="https://github.com/antlr/grammars-v4/tree/master/tsql">T-sql</a> </h4><br><p>  No decent parsers were found for T-SQL, not to mention open ones, and we have long and painstakingly restored the grammar from the MSDN documentation.  However, the result was decent: it already covers many common syntactic structures, looks neat, runtime-independent and covered with tests (examples of SQL queries from the same MSDN).  Since 2015, more than 15 third-party users have contributed to it.  Moreover, this grammar is now already used in <strong>DBFW</strong> , a firewall prototype at the level of database management systems, the <strong><a href="https://www.ptsecurity.com/ww-en/products/af/">PT Application Firewall</a></strong> subproject.  <strong>Denis Kolegov</strong> with <strong>Arseny Reutov</strong> told about him on PHDays VII: <a href="https://youtu.be/TzvB21GZgEY">‚ÄúHow to develop DBFW from scratch‚Äù</a> . </p><br><h4 id="mysqlhttpsgithubcomantlrgrammars-v4treemastermysql">  <a href="https://github.com/antlr/grammars-v4/tree/master/mysql">Mysql</a> </h4><br><p>  The grammar developed by the above team, primarily <strong>Ivan Khudyashov</strong> and Denis Kolegov, based on T-SQL.  It is also used in DBFW. </p><br><h4 id="phphttpsgithubcomantlrgrammars-v4treemasterphp">  <a href="https://github.com/antlr/grammars-v4/tree/master/php">Php</a> </h4><br><p>  This grammar was translated from Bison grammar to ANTLR.  It is interesting because it supports parsing immediately PHP, JavaScript and HTML.  More precisely, sections of JavaScript and HTML code are parsed into text that is later processed by parsers specifically for these languages. </p><br><h4 id="javahttpsgithubcomantlrgrammars-v4treemasterjava">  <a href="https://github.com/antlr/grammars-v4/tree/master/java">Java</a> </h4><br><p>  Grammar with Java 8 support was developed quite recently.  The grammar of the previous seventh version was taken as a basis.  However, the new test cases with different syntax (AllInOne7.java, AllInOne8.java) have been significantly expanded and improved, and the results of performance tests for popular Java projects (jdk8, Spring Framework, Elasticsearch, etc.) have been added. </p><br><h4 id="javascripthttpsgithubcomantlrgrammars-v4treemasterjavascript">  <a href="https://github.com/antlr/grammars-v4/tree/master/javascript">Javascript</a> </h4><br><p> Built on the old <a href="https://github.com/antlr/grammars-v4/tree/master/ecmascript">ECMAScript</a> grammar without exacting standard compliance.  When developing grammars, we are primarily guided by practical application and comprehensibility, not formal compliance.  Another significant difference is the almost complete support for ECMAScript 6, as well as outdated constructions (Html ‚Äã‚Äãcomments, CDATA sections). </p><br><p> Not all syntactic constructions can be described only with the help of grammar rules.  In some situations it is convenient and necessary to use code inserts in the target runtime language.  For example, in JavaScript the <code>get</code> token in some cases is a regular identifier, and in others it is a keyword describing the property <code>getter</code> .  Those.  This token can be parsed as a common identifier, and in the parser you can check the value of the token when processing the property: </p><br><pre> <code class="hljs objectivec"><span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">getter</span></span> : Identifier{p(<span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">"get"</span></span>)}? propertyName ;</code> </pre> <br><p>  This grammar is interesting in that these code inserts are <em>universal</em> , at least for C # and Java runtimes, thanks to the <br>  <a href=""><code>superClass</code></a> . </p><br><p>  Those.  In C # code, the <code>p("get")</code> function is described in the parent class of JavaScriptBaseParser.cs: </p><br><pre> <code class="hljs cs"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">protected</span></span></span><span class="hljs-function"> </span><span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">bool</span></span></span><span class="hljs-function"> </span><span class="hljs-title"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-title">p</span></span></span><span class="hljs-function">(</span><span class="hljs-params"><span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-params"><span class="hljs-keyword">string</span></span></span></span><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-params"> str</span></span></span><span class="hljs-function">)</span></span> =&gt; _input.Lt(<span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">-1</span></span>).Text.Equals(str);</code> </pre> <br><p>  In Java, this function looks like this (JavaScriptBaseLexer.java): </p><br><pre> <code class="java hljs"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">protected</span></span></span><span class="hljs-function"> </span><span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">boolean</span></span></span><span class="hljs-function"> </span><span class="hljs-title"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-title">p</span></span></span><span class="hljs-params"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-params">(String str)</span></span></span><span class="hljs-function"> </span></span>{ <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">return</span></span> _input.LT(-<span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">1</span></span>).getText().equals(str); }</code> </pre> <br><h4 id="chttpsgithubcomantlrgrammars-v4treemastercsharp">  <a href="https://github.com/antlr/grammars-v4/tree/master/csharp">C #</a> </h4><br><p>  This is mostly an experimental grammar created for comparing the speeds of parsers based on ANTLR and Roslyn parser. </p><br><h4 id="razrabotka-i-perspektivy">  Development and prospects </h4><br><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/web/669/661/07d/66966107d79e4b23a45fe1c6371f8d3d.png" alt="ANTLR Logo" hspace="15"><br><p>  Details of the development of grammars can be found in our last year‚Äôs article <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/pt/blog/210772/">‚ÄúTheory and practice of source code parsing using ANTLR and Roslyn‚Äù</a> . </p><br><p>  As can be seen from the change history and a large number of accepted Pull Request ( <a href="https://github.com/antlr/grammars-v4/pulls%3Futf8%3D%25E2%259C%2593%26q%3Dis%253Apr%2Bis%253Amerged%2Blabel%253Atsql%2B">tsql</a> , <a href="https://github.com/antlr/grammars-v4/pulls%3Futf8%3D%25E2%259C%2593%26q%3Dis%253Apr%2Bis%253Amerged%2Blabel%253Aplsql%2B">plsql</a> , <a href="https://github.com/antlr/grammars-v4/pulls%3Futf8%3D%25E2%259C%2593%26q%3Dis%253Apr%2Bis%253Amerged%2Blabel%253Amysql%2B">mysql</a> ), these grammars are refined not only by the efforts of Positive Technologies, but also by a large number of third-party developers.
