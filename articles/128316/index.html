I wonder what will happen with the projects written in CakePHP 1.x.  And the most exciting question is what will happen to Croogo - a great development tool for CakePHP.  Plans for the future is shared by the developer Croogo CMS. <br><br>  Free translation of a small interior with Fahad Ibnay Heylaal (developer of Croogo CMS). <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <a href="http://croogo.org/">Offside croogo</a>

      <i>- Where do you work and what position do you occupy?</i> <br>  Currently working in <a href="http://skylightit.com/">Skylight Interactive</a> .  This is in London.  I'm a web developer. <br><br>  <i>- Why did you choose CakePHP?</i> <br>  It was easier for me to understand Cake in comparison with other MVC frameworks.  And so I could make my code more understandable and usable. <br><br>  <i>- Do you take part in the development of the framework itself?</i> <br>  No, for the time being I'm not part of the developers.  However, I think this is possible in the future. <br><br>  <i>- Write a CMS - is it difficult?</i> <br>  It all depends on what you need.  If you need an all-inclusive-multi-functional (shared bus :)) CMS, then this is difficult.  But I tried to make everything simple and understandable. <br><br>  <i>- How did you get the idea to write a CMS on CakePHP?</i> <br>  I designed the site on CakePHP, and I needed a simple CMS for my needs.  So it all began. <br><br>  <i>- And now the most interesting and exciting question: when will the stable release of the Croogo CMS be?</i> <br>  As soon as all tickets for version 1.3 are closed in Lighthouse.  Already with the next version, Croogo should come out of beta. <br><br>  <i>- The wiki on the site already has a section for version 2.0.</i>  <i>How much will the new version differ from 1.3.x?</i> <br>  The entire system will be migrated to CakePHP 2.0.  Perhaps the terminology will be changed to make life easier for administrators.  I will post my ideas for version 2.0 in the Google Group, as soon as version 1.3 is stable.  And only after that development will begin. <br><br>  <i>- How many people are working on the development of Croogo?</i> <br>  No one works permanently and full time.  But there were already more than 20 people made changes to the core. <br><br>  <i>- Do you plan to use CakePHP 2 for the new version of Croogo?</i> <br>  Yes, Croogo 2.0 will work on CakePHP 2.0. <br><br>  <i>- Do you use Croogo in your daily work?</i>  <i>And how often?</i> <br>  At the moment my job is skylightit.com, a project management application for CakePHP.  So, now I do not use Croogo at work.  But I use Croogo in side projects. <br><br>  <i>- In your opinion, what is the most successful Croogo project?</i> <br>  Not many people let know where and how they use Croogo.  But I know how many sites built on it.  These are mostly blogs.  But I happened to work on one project - <a href="http://www.customartonline.com/">Custom Art Online</a> , which later turned out to be a good business. <br><br>  <i>- Where to start, if you first see the Croogo CMS?</i> <br>  Before starting, you should read the <a href="http://wiki.croogo.org/">wiki</a> to understand the basic principles and ideas.  But I hope that the admin interface is clear and intuitive.  It remains only to understand the terminology. <br><br>  <i>- Can third-party developers take part in the work on this CMS?</i>  <i>And what is needed for that?</i> <br>  Anyone can fork Croogo on <a href="http://github.com/croogo/croogo">GitHub</a> and send requests to the pool.  If I like the code, then there is a high probability that this code will fall into the master. <br><br>  <i>- For which projects can CroogoCMS be used?</i> <br>  Those that require a CMS :).  But given the powerful ACL functionality that works out of the box, the CMS can be used for a wide range of CakePHP-based applications. <br><br>  <i>- What is the future of Croogo?</i>  <i>What are your plans?</i> <br>  The main task is to keep everything simple.  This system should be the starting point for any CakePHP projects.  This is why it all started.  But needs are changing and open source projects are evolving.  I would really like Croogo to become the choice of not only CakePHP developers, but also PHP developers in general. <br><br>  <i>- A few words to developers who are just starting to work with Croogo</i> <br>  If you are a developer who works with Croogo, you should know CakePHP.  The best recommendation is <a href="http://book.cakephp.org/">to teach</a> CakePHP, and of course read the <a href="http://wiki.croogo.org/">wiki</a> in the documentation of Croogo itself.  Also, you should look into the Croogo code.  This will help to understand how everything works and teach the correct code. <br>  If you have an interesting idea or have encountered a problem, you can write about this to the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/croogo">Google Group</a> where you can always be helped. <br><br><hr><br><br>  We are waiting for croogo transition to CakePHP 2. <br><br>  <a href="http://tvorzasp.com/blog/interview-s-razrabotchikom-croogo">Original</a> <br><br>  PS If the Hubs community is interested in the CroogoCMS topic, which incorporates the best from WP, Drupal, joomla!  (and all this at normal MVC!), then there will definitely be a series of articles. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/128316/">https://habr.com/ru/post/128316/</a></p>
