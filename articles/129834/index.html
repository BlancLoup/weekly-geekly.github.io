There are two kinds of comments that I would like to answer: <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  1) ‚ÄúIt seems he is pretty bothering - he really delves into everything and hacks.  I have no idea how this could be simple, and certainly it is not something that the ‚Äúend user‚Äù may encounter. ‚Äù <br>  Such a response can only come from users who work exclusively on well-defined platforms - HTML, iOS, Android, Flash, Ruby, Node, Python, Java.  Having the opportunity to work at this level is, of course, wonderful - but in order to really enjoy the process, you need to work at the POSIX-level - it is not confused, it is normal.  Using LD_LIBRARY_PATH or volatile variables is common to many programmers.  I did not say anything about "end users".  We are all users. <br><br>  2) ‚ÄúWelcome to adulthood!‚Äù, ‚ÄúLoch developer NodeJS whines that UNIX turns out to be complicated.‚Äù <br>  I am not new to programming.  In my company, where most people work on KVM, ZFS, or Solaris Zones, my modest status in the world of system development is clear.  However, something I understand in such matters.  This post was not a reaction to the first steps in exploring a dynamic link search.  And he wasn‚Äôt about D-Bus infuriating me all week.  I fight systems like this every day.  I deeply respect professional software developers such as Robert Mustacchi, Trent Mick and Dave Pacheco, who every day dive into the shit without complaining, and come up with success.  Day after day, I strive (mostly successful?) For the same silent slope.  So yes, I'm really a sucker when it comes to software, but not in relation to the things I've listed. <br><br>  I understand that our software infrastructure is extremely powerful and flexible, and that all the difficulties with it pay off in full.  On my team, we pretty much stick in to provide Node users with a friendly working environment.  They create useful sites with its help - they enjoy working with Node - so we don‚Äôt waste time.

      From time to time it is interesting to step back and look at bedlam in general.  Are you really so numb that you can't think of anything better?  Can't you imagine a world in which a person could work with his own code without the principle of volatile variables?  Can't imagine an operating system with just an integrated IPC-Bus?  Do you really believe that this can not be done otherwise? <br><br>  The POSIX software infrastructure is not perfect, but it gets better with every new addition we make for it: be it the glib object model or special characters in your tester.  We have to program it as if we are sitting on a pile of crutches as tall as a twenty-story house - because, as a user, Unix is ‚Äã‚Äãlike that. <br><br>  And although I am embarrassed by the flow of words that is obviously rich in epithets, I do not regret that I spoke.  The infrastructure of our software is hard to handle.  Could be better.  And it seems to me that nine hundred +1 says that people agree with me. <br><br>  Original: <a href="https://plus.google.com/115094562986465477143/posts/VZJbdwwfiAD">plus.google.com/115094562986465477143/posts/VZJbdwwfiAD</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/129834/">https://habr.com/ru/post/129834/</a></p>
