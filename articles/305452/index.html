Many people understand that VKontakte groups have a half-dead audience.  Even if you have 100 thousand subscribers, this does not mean that you will receive several thousand clicks on the links in your post, even in the next hour. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5ea/f54/436/5eaf54436d614ca3bb816bbc386766f2"><br><br>  This arises from the fact that one person has several hundred subscriptions at once, and in order for him to see your post, it must happen: <br><ul><li>  By happy coincidence, go to VKontakte at the moment when you made the post, or scroll to your post - completely cut off 70-90% of your audience.  If your post goes into working hours, and your audience is very busy people, then only a few will see your post. </li><li>  Your post should be interesting and go through the algorithm of smart tape - even if a person enters the tape at the right moment, he will not see your post with some probability. </li></ul><br>  Thus, your 100 thousand subscribers easily turn into 100-200 live, which often make repost, write comments and so on.

      Many solve the problem by telegram, they say, by default, the push will come - plus can be seen in the dialogues, but not everything is so simple, <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bb7/1ef/817/bb71ef8173ad319dbbbaa163ffe04c5f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  Telegram is not a platform for reading news </h2><br>  You will not believe, but people put telegrams to communicate.  In other words, most of the telegraph‚Äôs huge audience has nothing to do with your bots or channels - they communicate there.  There is no general news feed in the telegram, it is impossible to filter information or reduce its volume - the user is unpleasant to hold many subscriptions and see it all. <br><br>  In this case, I fully support VKontakte in their endeavors to make a smart tape - this is a good automatic filter, but it also has disadvantages, but about them later. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6be/b85/736/6beb85736579b4d7240a586afc91c8e8.png" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  ‚ÄúMy audience is geeks - they love bots and telegrams‚Äù </h2><br>  This is a fallacy, although not entirely.  Even if your target audience is geeks, then you will actually have a higher conversion than usual, but geeks are people too and they like to communicate, even more than ordinary people. <br><br>  The geeks have more connections in the set, more friends on technical issues and work.  Geeks spend more time online.  But your channels and bots prevent them from communicating.  They are in the same dialogues as their own dialogs.  Therefore, each time you write a new post in a telegram, you shift its list of dialogs. <br><br>  As a result - in reality, any person, whether he is a geek or a regular user comes to 3-10 channels - no more.  The rest they either do not read, or do not have at all.  Well, of course there is an exception, but imagine what will happen if it is subscribed to 100 channels and a couple of dozen bots, you have to jump between the dialogs and constantly use the search <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e1f/6aa/986/e1f6aa986e024e57b8a84203199c1fa3.png"><br><br><h2>  Alternative - news or universal delivery service to the user. </h2><br>  Vkontakte is quite a good and well-thought social network, but smart tape has a huge number of flaws.  In this section, we describe why PushAll has more user-friendly tools for handling content. <br><br>  <b>1. Priority</b> Vkontakte you have a choice - either a smart tape or ordinary.  It is impossible to make so that the sender himself decides - whether a high priority post or not, the user cannot set up a whitelist for certain public places, as well as some public ones cannot ‚Äúmuffle‚Äù.  PushAll currently has a priority setting from low to high - when choosing each of the priorities, they are delivered to devices in different ways, the user can set the sound for high priority.  And for example, low priority pushes are not delivered to the device if it is locked (Android) <br><br>  <b>2. Pushes is a good container for information. The</b> user never reads all the posts in the feed, moreover - if you write a huge post - it may just be too lazy to read it at once - the reader will even miss your headline.  A push notification always has a more or less fixed length.  This means that each channel has a certain number of letters to draw attention to your content.  You can lure the user - and then he will already read the article in your source - it can be for example the same VC <br><br>  <b>3. Pushi - return traffic to your site.</b> For quite a long time, Vkontakte began copying an article into its interface, or people stopped following links because most often everything is in the post.  Due to the limitation of the size of the notification and the absence of any interface for reading large pieces of text, the user is forced to go back to your site.  And in the case of pushing it is all native - the notification comes in the browser and the person simply clicks on it.  This is equivalent to the fact that the user has deployed a post in VK <br><br>  <b>4. Information is fleeting.</b> News of an hour ago is no longer news.  When someone wins the championship - in 15 minutes the whole world already knows about it.  However, rotten posts continue to hang in your tape, making it difficult to gain access to more long-term posts, innovations, etc.  PushAll has a custom notification lifetime, that is, if you connect to the network after the notification lifetime expires, you will not receive it, and further settings will also be made in the notification ribbon - do not show expired, and in normal mode, overdue will be shown translucent . <br><br>  <b>5. Choice</b> We are constantly improving our notifications so that the user has a choice.  For example, about 15% of users receive email notifications in batches every few hours, someone daily.  For notifications, there will also be settings for quiet hours that prohibit the reception of notifications of medium and low priority, and after the expiration a summary will soon arrive - how many notifications of which priority are skipped - they can be read by clicking. <br><br>  <b>6. Versatility</b> Using Vkontakte you can not send a post to a specific group of people among all your subscribers - you can send a post only to <b>all subscribers</b> .  Telegram channels also do not allow it.  You can not use the same channel of communication with the user and to deliver new news to him, and to inform him about the need to pay.  You will definitely have to spend time and money to establish several sources of communication with the user, and the user will have to subscribe to you in different places, confirm data, etc.  However, even if you send notifications to everyone - users already on their side can filter your notifications by keywords. <br><br>  A small example: <br>  1. There is a public in the VC MKD (the first thing I met, I apologize, but significant) 400 thousand subscribers in the VC, 1500 subscribers in the telegraph - the official telegraph channel.  About 300-400 views of posts judging by the channel. <br>  2. Baibako groups - 60 thousand subscribers, 3300 subscribers in PushAll, of which about 2000 are active (receiving in the last 2 weeks) <br>  I think there is no need to even specifically explain here - the audience of the baibako in VK is almost 7 times less, while the subscribers in almost the same channel are 2 times more.  This means that the effectiveness of PushAll in this example is 14 times greater than the efficiency of Telegram. <br><br>  We are going in the direction of custom algorithms, plus everything will be automatic, which will take into account the priorities and lifetime described above.  This is a much newer level of content management, more lively and suitable for the realities of the modern world, where there is a lot of information and it is constantly changing.  The current telegram channels are more like a step back - there are even fewer amenities than in the VC tape, but yes - if you manage to recruit a lot of people on your telegram channel - you will play a significant role in the lives of these people. <br><br>  However, we must remember that users go to hundreds of sites, dozens of which they visit every day.  You always send information that is tagged not to your entire audience, but to a certain part of it - PushAll can help you deliver your information to the very people who need it, our goal is to reduce information noise, forcing the publisher to interact with the audience more precisely. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/305452/">https://habr.com/ru/post/305452/</a></p>
