They give an excellent analogy at the end - the icons are like adjectives and adverbs in the text;  The text should not lose connectivity without them, but they can add emotionality and accents in moderation.

This is a big breakthrough in integrating core OS solutions and third-party applications, making the ecosystem even more holistic. <br><br> <a href="http://www.apple.com/ios/ios10-preview/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/132/449/536/1324495367f5d4643edb28412fabe8eb.jpg" alt="iOS 10" width="780" height="378"></a> <br><br>  Applications have several presentation formats and call points.  First, the notifications on the lock screen and in the very center of the notifications have changed - they became similar to those in the clock, and the content is not so limited in height.  Moreover, now right from here you can call general information through 3D touch (which is interactive), plus the usual quick actions in a new form.  And the notification center itself finally displays the usual list of incoming chronologically, without stupid grouping by application.  Android and iOS are even closer. <br><br>  Secondly, the applications have widgets (by clicking on the 3D touch icon), which can be quickly added to the widget ribbon (available via a swipe to the left on the lock screen).  Third, they are integrated into Siri.  Fourth, third-party applications can be integrated into the main interfaces - for example, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016/06/13/ios-10-will-transcribe-voicemails/">dialers</a> can appear on the lock screen as a standard phone call and get into the history of calls. <br><br>  Interestingly, a large piece of the presentation showed fairly tight work with the incoming information without leaving the lock screens and notifications, and this is a sound way to abandon the endless process of managing an eye ... ugh, running applications.  This is what Windows Phone tried to do and what Golden Krishna says in its #NoUI. <br><br>  According to the updated applications, it seems that the very emasculated visual language of the platform after iOS 7 will finally add character.  In the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016/06/13/apple-music-redesign/">new music</a> appeared bold headlines, tiles and savory shadows on the covers.  The controls have come to a common denominator based on the quick action menu (and even the quick action panel that has been denounced by everyone has become slimmer with them).  The titles of photo albums have a lot of options for the inscriptions, the messages so generally triumph with expression in the form of animated special effects.  The news application and smart home control is vividly looking.  Apparently, it‚Äôs not just that Joni Ive disappeared from the radar - his soulless monochrome unification was not much better than the Gypsy region of Scott Forstal. <br><br>  From interesting interface solutions: <br><ul><li>  Shared clipboard with all iOS and macOS devices.  Copied on a laptop, pasted in the phone. </li><li>  Fast translation from Emoji language to the usual and vice versa  They have become slang, not everyone understands, so it will simplify communication. </li><li>  Tips for the nearest places in the maps, tied to the calendar and habits. </li><li>  CarPlay somehow was able to display maps on the central toolbar, while usually automakers are strongly clamped third-party integration. </li><li>  When typing on the keyboard, the contact data is suggested, this is the next step in their usefulness. </li><li>  Voicemail will finally have a text transcription. </li><li>  The photo viewer has learned to distinguish people in the photo, and it works without the Internet. </li><li>  An inactive phone responds to a raise - the screen lights up automatically. </li><li>  <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016/06/13/apple-pay-is-coming-to-the-mobile-web/">Apple Pay will work in the mobile web</a> , so <a href="https://twitter.com/lukew/status/527108944834351104">Luke Wroblewski can put one more check mark in the list of successful concepts</a> . </li><li>  Hours will allow to be authorized on the Poppy, just being near to it.

Identity in isolation from the product is less and less important, so that the bottom-up approach is more and more used when the interface team identifies the identity. <br><br> <a href="http://www.fastcodesign.com/3061384/are-branding-agencies-still-relevant"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7e9/108/647/7e9108647946e7741615b010a575af61.jpg" alt="Are Branding Agencies Still Relevant?" width="780" height="439"></a> <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S240587261530037X">DesignX - Complex Sociotechnical Systems</a></strong> <br>  Detailed article by Donald Norman and Pieter Jan Stappers on DesignX.
