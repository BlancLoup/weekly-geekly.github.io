The anti-piracy group BREIN from the Netherlands considers the plugin "an illegal application" and demands that the administrators "immediately stop distributing Torrents Time"). <br><br>  The plugin is really convenient - it allows you to watch movies from torrents online, without the need to download a video file to your PC.  At the same time, torrent clients like uTorrent or Transmission are not required for viewing.  Developers have downloaded the plug-in code on <a href="https://github.com/PopcornRepos/PopcornTimeOnline">GitHub</a> , so that any user who wants to do something based on an existing project can easily implement his plans. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Torrent trackers quickly appreciated the benefits of the plugin, and added support for it.  The most famous resource that made it is ThePirateBay.

If the plugin is not installed, you can download Torrents Time to your PC via the same link.  The video player is quite simple, but at the same time it provides most of the functions needed by the user. <br><br>  The plugin is distributed through <a href="https://torrents-time.com/">the site of the same name</a> , which became the target of anti-pirates.  And BREIN requires the administration of the resource to close it, stopping the distribution of the plugin.  In addition, the group requires the creators of the plugin to reveal their identities and specify the address of residence.  What for?  To have leverage on developers "in case you continue your illegal activities."  If the administration of the resource refuses, BREIN <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2016/02/08/anti-piracy-group-brein-demands-torrents-time-cease-and-desist/">will seek</a> from the hosting provider to block the resource and provide personal data to all administrators.  And yes, BREIN believes that the Torrents Time team "is responsible for all (further) expenses of the case, including the payment of legal fees." <br><br>  The plugin development team sent its answer to BREIN, which was clearly prepared by a lawyer.  Here is the beginning: ‚ÄúFrom the very beginning, I would like to inform you that my clients deny all the assumptions and assumptions stated in the letter, including the fact that BREIN represents the interests of the right holders, and you have the right to act on behalf of unnamed and unidentified individuals.‚Äù  The compiler of the letter also states that the whole team is very well acquainted with the legal side of the matter, working in this field for about 30 years.  The entire answer is in the same vein, and the full text of the letter from the BREIN team can be <a href="https://www.scribd.com/doc/298575385/BREIN-to-Torrents-Time">found here</a> (English). <br><br>  Will BREIN succeed in getting the group behind Torrents Time to shut down its website and project by stopping the distribution of the plugin?  Perhaps, but the probability of this is small. <br><br>  The Torrents Time team has already stated about its intention to continue the work: ‚ÄúThis [our appearance] means that any user who knows how to work with Facebook, from today, can enjoy almost any movie or show that has ever been created in this the world.  Torrents Time revolutionizes the world of torrents, here and now.  And since this is a revolution, you can expect blood to spill like during other revolutions. ‚Äù </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/371759/">https://habr.com/ru/post/371759/</a></p>
