  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Laboratory assistants</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Once upon a time there was a scientist.  A researcher, a practitioner, in general, an active person.  He had, as expected, his laboratory, where he spent most of his life.  It is clear that, since he gave all his time to work, there was no time for him to be in a lab order.  Therefore, he hired lab assistants.  They wrote down his notes on the fields, napkins and other pieces of paper, erased acid stains from the tables, washed the flasks and, in general, tried to maintain order. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The time has passed.  The scientist invented a lot, did a lot.  Most of his developments began to be used in practice.  He didn‚Äôt spend much time in the laboratory, but the technicians (who eventually became quite good performers) still put things in order, changed things, and rearranged something from place to place. <br><br>  And the scientist got married.  He abandoned his work, but he continued to pay his assistants, according to the old memory.  And they themselves refueled in his laboratory.  We brought to perfection his discoveries, made minor changes, cleaned up and corrected his notes.

      Time kept going.  The scientist died long ago, other people lived and worked in his house.  Only in the laboratory, where the children of his assistants already worked, everything was also seething with activity.  Of course, they could not come up with anything fundamentally new, but that small, tedious, but necessary work helped a lot - those who used the discoveries of a scientific husband, those who were somehow connected with this.  But most of all, this work gave the lab assistants themselves - they had jobs and an interesting occupation. <br><br>  That just did not appear more discoveries - there was no one to open.  There was nothing to rule, there was nowhere to restore order.  The laboratory began to work for the laboratory.  And the lab technicians gradually ceased to understand that their work was only help.  They arranged fights because of the geometry of the location of the flasks on the shelves.  Swore because of the best location of the cabinets with the works of the scientist.  For a long time they found out in which hand it is better to make edits and in what color to emphasize important places in the texts. <br><br>  It got to the point that when there was nothing left to do, they began to let anyone into the laboratory, hoping that one of the visitors would be a talented scientist.  But those were only students, minor officials and other people who tried to prove to themselves and the world that they were talents.  And many outside the laboratory, perceived this writings as something new and revolutionary.  Neddureno - all this pile of text was ideally extinct and sorted, and the work of the scientist - rewritten beyond recognition.  Simple truths and laws were distorted and turned out, and the creations of new people were written easily and understandably.  The originals of the old works were hidden, they all prayed, but no one read. <br><br>  Gradually, people forgot that it was once decided to look at the content, and not at the design.  Well, and the former lab assistants, who were now called new names ‚Äî checkers, picture makers, printers, distributors, and so on, replaced former scientists and researchers. <br>  Everyone tried to follow the rules established by them, to consult with them on every little thing and try to write and arrange their works so that even a child could understand them. <br><br>  The caste of former lab technicians rules the ball ... <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/26031/">https://habr.com/ru/post/26031/</a></p>
