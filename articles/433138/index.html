When I first arrived, there were only fifteen product designers at Booking.  To date, this number has grown to three hundred.  During this time, product managers also became much more.

      In my report, I will talk about five basic principles that define the design of our products. <br><br><h3>  Five principles of Booking in design </h3><br><h4>  1. Design for people </h4><br>  The name speaks for itself, but sometimes the understanding can be distorted.  The ultimate goal of design is the person and his personal experience. <br><br><h4>  2. Details - there is a design </h4><br>  At Booking.com we design on a huge scale, but this does not mean that we ignore the niche needs of users in the product. <br><br><h4>  3. Do what is right, not what you can </h4><br>  It is often easier to go the easy way, but this can negatively affect the user experience (UX).  Therefore, we always strive to do what is important to our users in the first place. <br><br><h4>  4. Rely on data and be guided by empathy. </h4><br>  We often hear that food teams to perform daily tasks are based on data.  In Booking we use data, but we definitely support it with empathy.  First of all, we empathize with our users, that is, we study their pain, and only then we look at the statistical data. <br><br><h4>  5. Design - team sport </h4><br>  Not only designers are responsible for the design.  Designers, product managers and other professionals should work as a team to create a product and gain valuable experience. <br>  Everyone is a UX designer.  Whether you are a project manager, a marketing director, a CEO, a restaurant waiter or a taxi driver, everyone has the opportunity to create or influence user experience.  This can also be considered a personal experience.  Because people are what really matters.  I mean not only the user experience, but also experience, whatever it is. <br><br><h3>  What if you want to create a good UX? </h3><br>  <b>Ask more correct questions</b> <b><br></b> <br>  Most encountered the following questions: <br><br><ul><li>  How do I increase my income? </li><li>  How do I reduce costs? </li><li>  How do I increase sales from existing customers? </li><li>  How can I increase the number of new customers? </li><li>  How do I increase the value of shares? </li></ul><br>  These are fairly common questions, especially when we talk about growing products.  But we consider it wrong to ask these questions, although they, of course, are important and require an answer.  If you want to create a good UX, do not start with these questions. <br><br>  A recent example is Snapchat.  The product has a large user base, which continues to grow, but does not make a lot of money.  We could go back to one of the questions and ask how to increase revenue, for example.  But this, as I mentioned, would not be the right decision.  Snapchat's design changes caused a flurry of discontent on the part of users.  Over a million people have signed a petition to reverse these changes. <br><br>  Below is a fragment of data from HubSpot, which refers to the most important factor in site design.  More than 76% of surveyed users said that a good site makes it easy to find what they want. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/po/y3/oc/poy3ocnqir4fhj76qlbkomzq2du.png"><br><br>  <b>Chat with your users</b> <b><br></b> <br>  At Booking.com we try to regularly communicate with users, using various tools: <br><br><ul><li>  online survey tools; </li><li>  street tests; </li><li>  usability tests; </li><li>  user research; </li><li>  diary study; </li></ul><br>  As an example, I was working on a chat bot.  We had a business idea: we wanted this chat bot to help customers easily get answers to recurring questions without having to contact the service.  To test the idea, we went to Starbucks and showed visitors prototype designs.  We just talked to people, not all of them were even users of Booking.com.  But it allowed us to test our idea and get real feedback. <br>  Practice empathy. <br><br>  We also regularly work on the problems that people have with the product.  For this we do a diary study study.  They help to reveal the emotions of users.  We have been watching users since the moment they thought about booking, and we are watching the emotional state at every stage of booking.  Based on the information received, we draw conclusions as to why the situation was successful or brought disappointment. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/5k/fk/ua/5kfkuakbrh-td-3lm2tlryurzge.png"><br><br><h3>  What can we do to improve user experience? </h3><br>  One way is to create a collection of various tools for testing your products by people.  Examples include the following tools: <br><br><ul><li>  design sprints; </li><li>  brainstorm; </li><li>  travel cards; </li><li>  points of contact; </li><li>  jobs to be done; </li><li>  question: how could we ..? </li></ul><br>  I like the last item.  We are trying to complete the phrase in such a way as to understand how we can help users.  After that we generate a hypothesis. <br><br>  <b>Hypothesis generation</b> <br><br><ul><li>  what does success look like? </li><li>  understanding what we plan to achieve? </li></ul><br>  If you have an idea, you must prove its value at the business level and at the user experience level.  It is very important to calculate that the business and the user will receive in return.  When you work with proof of hypotheses, it is important not to forget: what you think does not matter.  The contribution of your team's ideas is great, but product design is based on facts, and not just on the opinions of people who know the theory of product creation. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/1p/ha/_f/1pha_fwz9qfvoclbkv4e9oevewo.jpeg"><br><br>  The design development process becomes a continuous cycle: we prove hypotheses, create prototypes, test, and learn from the experience.  The main task of this cycle is to learn from the experience gained, be it successful or unsuccessful. <br><br>  Everything I have said is the basis and will work for any company of any size.  This will work for you and for your own products and, in fact, accompany their growth. <br><br>  More product marketing reports available on the <a href="https://t.me/epicgrowth">@epicgrowth</a> Telegram channel.
