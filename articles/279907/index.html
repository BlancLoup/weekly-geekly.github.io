  <section class="page js-page"><h1>NetApp ONTAP Cloud: Amazon & Azure</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The advantage of any cloud service is that it is the actual service.  You do not bother where the equipment lives, who services it, etc.  But this is also its dark side: who has access to your data, how many copies of your data are stored in backup copies and backup data centers and where?  For a long time all these questions have repelled some large companies and government agencies. <br><br>  Having solved these issues, many companies would be able to start using cloud services.  To solve this problem, the <a href="http://cloud.netapp.com/cloud-ontap">ONTAP Cloud Cloud</a> Storage System was developed - a virtual machine living in a public Amazon or Azure cloud with built-in encryption function.  Now you own and manage your data and only you.  Read more on the <a href="http://www.netapp.com/us/products/platform-os/cloud-ontap.aspx">official website of NetApp</a> and official documentation on <a href="https://mysupport.netapp.com/documentation/productlibrary/index.html%3FproductID%3D61908">the product itself</a> and on <a href="https://mysupport.netapp.com/documentation/productlibrary/index.html%3FproductID%3D61906">OnCommand Cloud Manager</a> . <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/43d/789/8d5/43d7898d5ecc4e838ad78b6ba5be7cfa.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  From a management and interface point of view, this is a regular ONTAP with a few limitations, like the <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/279875/">ONTAP Edge</a> and <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/303146">ONTAP Select</a> twin brothers in ONTAP Cloud there is no RAID-DP and FCP.  But otherwise this is a full-fledged storage system, just living in a cloud.  You can <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/279911/">replicate your data from a productive FAS system</a> to the cloud to create a DR site and development environment.  And in case of an accident, switch to the backup site and start all or at least the most important services. <br><br>  This is very convenient from a financial point of view: after the accident, you just before-order the necessary resources in the cloud and start your services, there is no need to buy equipment and maintain it on the second backup site.

    <h3>  High availability </h3><br>  ONTAP Cloud supports both mono-mode and HA mode, when two uplaens are located in different Availability zones to provide fault tolerance inside the cloud.  Despite the fact that almost all cloud providers assure their customers of high availability of their data centers, multiple paths, component duplication, etc.  all decent cloud providers also highly recommend backing up regularly.  Somehow it does not fit in with one another, right?  The fact is that all the same, no matter how cool inside the cloud, there are accidents.  And there are such accidents when customers either temporarily do not have access to their data or lose data in whole or in part, for a certain period of time.  There are examples of this, because of this cloud providers recommend backing up to the cloud.  Thus, ensuring high availability of data within the cloud is a very demanded feature. <br><br>  The High Availability feature allows you to ensure high data availability in the cloud by placing two nodes of the HA systems in two different Availability zones, which will allow you to survive in the event of a data center crash, automatically switch transparently and provide data access for applications using this data. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/365/033/b3f/365033b3ff294ecaa86fdebd7727ba59.gif"></div><br><h3>  Disaster Recovery site in the cloud </h3><br>  A DR site is only needed when a replica is running and when it is necessary to switch to a DR site, all the rest of ONTAP can be turned off and save you money, because in public clouds AWS / Azure payment is hourly.  Work schedules can be configured with ONTAP for Cloud to save budget. <br><br><h3>  Intra &amp; Inter Cloud Replication </h3><br>  With SnapMirror technology, you can replicate data from ONTAP for Cloud to <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/303146/">ONTAP Select</a> , FAS, and <a href="http://cloud.netapp.com/netapp-private-storage">NPS</a> , as well as between several ONTAP for Cloud within one or even several public providers. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c42/73e/e37/c4273ee37f7843bcbdc33f7f832212f5.png"></div><br><h3>  Cloning </h3><br>  Another useful feature of ONTAP is the ability to finely clone data without affecting the performance of the cloud storage system.  This will allow you to deploy in the public cloud, in seconds, a lot of duplicates of your data for such tasks as testing, development, analytics, checking and cataloging backups, regardless of their size. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bbe/ed2/7f8/bbeed27f88c04415adeb5f822f77d339.png"><br><br><h4>  Cloud manager </h4><br>  Allows you to manage these features ONTAP Cloud: <br><br><ul><li>  Replicas between FAS, <a href="http://cloud.netapp.com/netapp-private-storage">NPS</a> , <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/303146/">ONTAP Select</a> and ONTAP for Cloud </li><li>  Manages encryption keys for ONTAP Cloud </li><li>  Displays the amount of computing resources consumed and storage in Amazon &amp; Azure </li><li>  Manage storage space: Create volums, aggregates, moons, file balls </li><li>  Update ONTAP version </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/73f/b46/4ad/73fb464ad38545cda1ed5786853b1564.gif"><br><br><h3>  Encryption </h3><br>  Two types of Data-at-Rest encryption are supported: AWS or ONTAP.  In the second case, you can store the encryption key in your home, which allows you to increase the security of your data and unlock data in the cloud using the KMIP protocol at the time of launching ONTAP. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DixAXqlocu4" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h3>  NetApp Private Storage (NPS) </h3><br>  This is a service that is related to the ONTAP Cloud product, but does not necessarily go along with it, I want to say a few words about it, since this is also a near-cloud product.  Yes, yes it is "NEAR-cloudy".  This is essentially a colocation service ( <a href="http://www.equinix.com/partners/net-app/">in Equinix data centers</a> ), where you can place your own or temporarily rented FAS ‚Äúnear the cloud‚Äù.  ‚ÄúNext to the cloud‚Äù means that the cloud provider has a direct connection to your storage: in the cloud, applications that use your storage are running and running.  only the computing service is paid from the cloud provider.  The data itself is located on your storage, not in the cloud, i.e.  the data is owned and controlled by you and only you.  And since ONTAP software (operating system) is used on this system, you can use SnapMirror or SnapVault to replicate data both ‚Äúon it‚Äù and ‚Äúfrom it‚Äù with any other system / platform using ONTAP: <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/303146/">ONTAP Select</a> (VSA SDS), <a href="http://cloud.netapp.com/netapp-private-storage">NPS</a> , FAS, AFF, another ONTAP Cloud. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/130/305/e4d/130305e4d8494127b52665ff2ecbc600.png"></div><br><br><h4>  Data Fabric Cloud Sync </h4><br>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/302810/">Data Fabric</a> is NetApp's development strategy and vision, and Cloud Sync is an implemented part of this strategy.  Cloud Sync service is also related to ONTAP Cloud, as well as to any other platform based on ONTAP software.  <a href="http://cloud.netapp.com/cloud-sync">Data Fabric Cloud Sync</a> allows you to synchronize NFS file sphere data in Amazon S3.  The service can serve as an archive of data that can be used for analytical processing within Amazon.  Data lying on the NFS ball on one of the platforms with ONTAP software is converted into objects and sent to the Amazon S3 storage.  Further, data in Amazon S3 can be processed by analytical algorithms for extracting reports (such as MapReduce, RedShift). <br><br>  I will give examples of the application of this service and data types for which analytical processing may be required: <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Healthcare:</b> Genomics, Pharmaceutical industry, patient records, disease analyst; </li><li>  <b>Oil and gas:</b> Seismic analytics, machine analysis, forecasting the demand for goods and services; </li><li>  <b>Finance:</b> Trading performance, loans and market risk management, fraud detection; </li><li>  <b>Automotive:</b> Behavioral analytics, supply chain management systems, predictive analytics. </li></ul><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2ac/1cb/022/2ac1cb02227c40d89ff716978a08d902.png"></div><br><h3>  Protocols </h3><br>  CIFS (SMB) v2 / 3, NFS 3/4 / 4.1, pNFS, iSCSI are supported. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c8c/dda/fd6/c8cddafd679641338ab709b2958328cf.gif"></div><br><br>  Like <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/303146/">ONTAP Select, the</a> ONTAP Cloud product has many useful features and integrations. <br><br><h3>  Licensing </h3><br>  There are two licensing schemes: when a customer pays for all services at Amazon / Azure.  The second scheme, when the customer buys from the provider only computing and storage space, and the license for ONTAP Cloud software is purchased through NetApp. <br><br><h4>  findings </h4><br>  With ONTAP Cloud, you yourself own and manage your data in the cloud and get the opportunity to replicate your data to other data centers and rich ONTAP functionality.  Deploying a backup data center will be cheaper in the cloud due to the fact that there is no need to maintain a backup site.  Based on the replicated data, you can deploy development and testing due to the functionality of thin data cloning.  Thin replication to the cloud will load network channels less and is an easy way to migrate your infrastructure to a public cloud. <br><br>  ¬ª <b>I ask to send messages on errors in the text to the <abbr title="Private message">LAN</abbr></b> <br><br>  ¬ª <b>Comments, additions and questions on the article on the contrary, please comment</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/279907/">https://habr.com/ru/post/279907/</a></p>
