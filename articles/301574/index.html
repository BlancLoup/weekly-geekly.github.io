In the article we will tell you what the uniqueness of our training program is and what specialists who graduated from the course ‚ÄúCorporate Laboratories‚Äù receive. <a name="habracut"></a>

      The program "Corporate Laboratories" is developed taking into account the materials and practices used by both hackers and employees of the information security departments of various companies.  Listening to the wishes of specialists attending our training, we regularly update the course content so as to ensure comfortable and high-quality training.  For these purposes, we have developed our own platforms: a convenient personal account, a functional service for viewing webinars, unique pentest laboratories built on the basis of corporate networks of real companies. <br><br><h2>  Corporate laboratories - only relevant material </h2><br>  Information security is an extremely dynamic area.  New methods and tools for penetration testing are updated at such intervals that it becomes extremely difficult to track them. <br><br>  Unlike foreign courses adapted for Russia and updated about once a year, the material of the course ‚ÄúCorporate Laboratories‚Äù is updated every 1.5-2 months.  For example, with the advent of Kali Linux 2.0 and the Kali Linux Rolling edition, our program was quickly updated to reflect the features of new distributions. <br><br>  In addition to the strongest practical training in the laboratory, which constitutes 80% of the course, we are very demanding of the instructors. <br><br>  Pentestit instructors who develop practical laboratories and webinar programs regularly upgrade their skills: <br><br><ul><li>  search for vulnerabilities on the most secure Internet resources as part of penetration testing; </li><li>  analyze the actions of cybercriminals in the framework of investigating cyber-crimes (forsensica); </li><li>  study and adopt the experience of foreign colleagues; </li><li>  conduct their own research and studies in the field of practical information security; </li><li>  write articles in the field of information security on popular resources and publications; </li><li>  develop tools and methods for conducting attacks and building effective protection; </li><li>  Adapt the OWASP methodology to the Russian language; </li><li>  regularly undergo internal training programs; </li></ul><br>  In addition, we are developing unique penetration testing laboratories Test lab, in which eminent experts in the field of practical information security from around the world take part.  This experience provides not only an understanding of the nature of modern vulnerabilities, but also good skills in protecting systems.  The important point is to maintain a balance between the inherent vulnerability, the ability to withstand the simultaneous exploitation of hundreds of participants and prevent compromise of the technical base of laboratories. <br><br>  Every day we are confronted with various types of attacks and methods of exploitation, which allows us to keep our knowledge base up to date, and prompt response and prediction of attack vectors of this infrastructure allow us to develop thinking flexibility and respond quickly to information security incidents. <br><br><h2>  Training </h2><br>  The course is completely remote.  For maximum comfort of students, we have developed a specialized webinar platform, a convenient personal account and a virtual lab environment, which is connected via a VPN connection. <br><br>  The consolidation of knowledge gained through the unique courses of ethical hacking and penetration testing from Pentestit is performed by completing tasks for hacking and protecting systems of varying complexity in conditions close to real ones.  In the process of training, employees study the nature of vulnerabilities, exploitation tools, get acquainted with the psychology and tools of the attacker and with the ways of protection. <br><br>  Most of the specialists who have already been trained in Pentestit Corporate Laboratories are active employees of large organizations (banks, state institutions, the largest Internet projects) and regularly raising their professional level in the field of practical information security. <br><br>  Learn more and sign up for the next courses can be on the <a href="https://www.pentestit.ru/labs/corp-lab">link</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/301574/">https://habr.com/ru/post/301574/</a></p>
