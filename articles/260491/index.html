As always, bug fixes plus a small update for Obj-C.  A larger update for the Swift language: version 2.0, finally with support for handling errors / exceptions.  Added SDK for watchOS 2.0 in the kit, if you are not eager to collect something new, not yet embodied on the watch from Apple.  Support iOS 9, well, it is, in working order. <br><br>  We turn to the heavy artillery.  So, new tools are included in the battle to optimize application resources!  Bitcode support has been added: optionally, it is possible to send an application that is not compiled for all architectures to itunesconnect, but an intermediate code that is already assembled on Apple‚Äôs servers under the user's target platform and already shipped in such a ready-made form.  And the application will be assembled with all the fresh libraries and updates that will be on Apple's servers at that moment (we don‚Äôt know at what time and how often this build will take place).  From the point of view of reducing the executable file, this is good, but from the point of view of stability, it can be both good and bad, depending on how the application is assembled without your control, so it may be worthwhile to be careful. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  What else?  Slicing: you can specify how much of the application resources on which device will be required, and the Apple server will give the user only what he needs.  First of all, it's a good thing, no more overhead for a start-pack app! <br><br>  On demand resources: built-in App Store the ability to load the necessary and delete unnecessary at the moment content for the application.  The most controversial innovation for games is if the content download server already exists and is the same for all platforms ... Well, let it be, maybe it will come in handy.  In addition, we will not be chauvinists, non-game native applications can benefit from this.

      And, finally, the most important, the most revolutionary change for such a conservative apple company: Free Provisioning!  Now, to build and debug the application on your device, you no longer need to buy a subscription to the Apple Developer Program.  No trouble, no doubt, just take the device, XCode and launch. <br><br>  I do not know who came up with this great idea, but nevertheless - the threshold for entering the development for iOS has dropped significantly.  Apparently, the competition with Android is paying off.  Although, maybe, you just need more developer <s>gold</s> .  ‚ÄúDevelopers! Developers! Developers! Developers‚Äù - knocking the ashes in our hearts, Steve! <br><br><br><h3>  <b>Mobile game in the Fallout universe</b> </h3><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/HY4jCjufLG8%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjC867PoZNdhkjup5Bcn6BkMk0ugQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Recently, the company Bethesda introduced to players a mobile game in the Fallout universe.  The game turned out to be a mixture of a city builder and a time manager and personally reminded me of another game according to the famous cinema franchise Tiny Death Star.  In essence, the player needs to manage the residents of a post-apocalyptic refuge, who, in the best traditions of the Sims, extract resources, pump skills, get tired and multiply. <br><br>  The game is not very demanding on Donat and in many respects thanks to this was very well received by the fans of the franchise.  However, paying players can still get some advantage by investing real money in the game. <br><br>  Fallout Shelter can already be downloaded from the App Store, but the Android version, as often happens, is late.  Looking forward to see you soon! <br><br><br><h3>  <b>May rating from Newzoo</b> </h3><br>  Analytical company Newzoo continues to publish its monthly reports on the state of the mobile market.  In the <a href="http://www.newzoo.com/insights/new-the-top-ios-games-in-the-us-china-europe/">May report</a> , tops are presented for downloads and revenue of mobile games for the App Store of three regions: the United States, Europe and China.  Suppose the report presents an analysis of only one platform, but a monthly analyst from Newzoo comes out earlier than that of the closest competitors of App Annie. <br><br>  So, the top 10 gaming iOS apps of May 2015 in three regions: <br><br>  <b>USA</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d1a/b86/cad/d1ab86cad2d24ff0bf92cc4f0fa64582.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Europe</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b27/115/f95/b27115f954704c1581db41375ce4de7c.jpg"><br><br>  <b>China</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b62/776/d59/b62776d592554219b74b8b0677212b2e.jpg"><br><br><br><h3>  <b>What Apple Features: Ratings, Price, and Categories</b> </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/faa/b3e/253/faab3e2537534e05868ce17b9595032d.jpg"><br><br>  Appbot demonstrated the <a href="http://apptractor.ru/deploy/app-stores/chto-ficherit-apple-otsenki-tsena-i-kategorii.html">results of the analysis of</a> applications for the iPhone, which are now finished in the American App Store.  As a result, 3 diagrams are presented showing the percentage by rating, price and categories of applications that are on the main App Store page. <br><br>  The application does not have to have a rating of 5 stars to get into the feature - about 70% of applications with a rating of 4-4.5.  Also, there are games with a rating of 3 stars and below - user ratings are important, but one unsuccessful update, which will spoil the overall rating of the application, will not cut off the path to the feature. <br><br>  Despite the fact that most of the fake applications are free, still more than 35% of applications are paid.  If we consider applications whose cost is below $ 5, then it can be seen that they are approximately equally found on the main App Store page. <br><br>  In the categories of the game do not leave a chance to anyone, although not a few applications from the sections: "Lifestyle", "Education", "Photo and video." <br><br>  The average age of applications that are featured is 1.3 years.  You can find applications with the release of 6-7 days ago, and there were those who are already 6 years old. <br><br><br><h3>  <b>Twitter shows ads for user-installed applications.</b> </h3><br>  The new Twitter tool, available to advertisers, <a href="http://apptractor.ru/marketing-monetization/ad-networks/twitter-pokazyivaet-reklamu-po-ustanovlennyim-u-polzovatelya-prilozheniyam.html">helps</a> target ads by category of applications, which makes it possible to select those users who are interested in a particular topic. <br><br>  For example, advertisers who promote a task management application can select the Productivity category and reach users who have recently installed similar applications, Twitter writes.  They can also select the Finance category, as there may also be people interested in the application. <br><br>  But it‚Äôs too early to talk about the use of this tool for game developers.  The category of games is not divided into any specific genres or subcategories, and this does not provide much assistance in targeting an advertising company.  Perhaps in the near future, Twitter will somehow independently process the information collected by applications, and in particular games, and offer a more accurate selection of users who may be interested in one or another game. <br><br><br><h3>  <b>From games to cartoons, designers and parks</b> </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b81/3a6/712/b813a671220c44b08da5cbcf38501939.jpg"><br><br>  It is very interesting to watch the development of character brands created by games.  Rovio is actively promoting its birds in various niches: they have already moved from the series to the <a href="http://app2top.ru/industry/v-seti-poyavilis-foto-posterov-k-fil-mu-angry-birds-58465.html">full-length film</a> and even open their theme parks.  Here I wanted to sarst, but their actions are quite natural and logical.  If it is impossible to make good and profitable games, then it is necessary to develop and consolidate the achievements that already exist. <br><br>  Apparently, Rovio finally accepted themselves, realizing all the advantages and disadvantages, decided to move away from the image of the publisher in the direction of an entertainment company.  Even with Lego collaborate, released <a href="http://app2top.ru/games-2/rovio-i-lego-vy-pustyat-konstruktor-po-motivam-angry-birds-58332.html">branded designer</a> .  Lego actively go to the games, and Rovio - to the real world. <br><br>  Afterwards, ZeptoLab decided to follow a similar path - together with Blockade Entertainment they <a href="http://kanobu.ru/news/sozdateli-cut-the-rope-delayut-multfilm-pro-am-nyama-376678/">shot a cartoon</a> about their most epic freak Om Nom.  Such are the movements of heroes from cartoons to games and from games to cartoons.  We are waiting for the final merger of the film and gaming industries :) <br><br>  ************************************************** ************************************************** ***************************************** <br>  If you liked the material and you had time to evaluate the professionalism of the authors of this blog - there is an opportunity to join them.
