The solution has flexible tariff plans (including a free tariff) and a set of extensions that allow you to select the required modules depending on current needs.  We offer you a review of the new Panda Dome. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  What is Panda Dome </h4><br>  Panda Security has released a new anti-virus Panda Dome - a comprehensive solution for the security of home devices with support for Windows, Mac and Android.  This solution has replaced the Panda 2017 home antivirus product line. The solution is based on a new engine, includes a number of changes and additions to the protection options, and also includes a new VPN module.  All changes were made in order to further increase the level of protection, performance and usability.

      <br>
      The main difference in the Panda Dome concept from the previous Panda 2017 home product line is that the new solution is not a line of individual products with its own functionality, but a <b>single</b> product, i.e.  A single platform, which, depending on the chosen tariff plan, provides the user with access to certain protection modules and services.  Thus, Panda Dome is a flexible structure that adapts its behavior to the specific needs of the user.  As a result, the user can build the product "by himself": for example, free Panda Dome Free + paid Panda CleanUp extension to optimize PC performance + paid Panda VPN Premium extension, etc. <br><br>  The Panda Dome solution is based on the next generation engine.  The main difference is the use of Big Data and Artificial Intelligence, which allows continuous monitoring of absolutely all active processes and their interaction with each other, regardless of whether these processes are legitimate (reliable) or not.  The new engine allows you to provide reliable protection against new, improved and unknown threats. <br><br>  By the way, it influenced the choice of the name.  Dome, translated from English, among other options, means the dome, cap.  Thus, the user of Panda Dome is under a strong dome, protecting it from digital threats. <br><br>  So let's move from words to deeds and see what the Panda Dome really is.  In today's article we will mainly talk about Panda Dome for Windows as the most common operating system.  However, be sure to mention the capabilities of the solution to protect Android and Mac. <br><br><h4>  Installing on Windows </h4><br>  Panda Dome, like previous versions of Panda's home antivirus software, is a very light product, justifying its ‚Äúcloudiness‚Äù.  If we talk about protection for Windows, then installing the solution requires a processor with a clock speed of at least 300 MHz and at least 128 MB of RAM, as well as Windows XP (SP3, 32-bit), Vista, 7, 8 and 10 (32 and 64-bit).  As you can see, such modest system requirements allow you to install the product on almost any computer. <br><br>  We downloaded the Panda Dome distribution from the global website <a href="http://www.pandasecurity.com/">www.pandasecurity.com</a> .  It turned out to be a small online installer of about 2 MB in size. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/iy/y7/x9/iyy7x9nblsqueex_dfp0pu6hoje.jpeg"><br><br>  At the very beginning of the installation, you must specify the activation code.  But if you do not have it, you can continue without it - in this case the product will be installed in the free version.  After that, you need to specify the installation folder (or accept the default one), and also choose the interface language (by default, it is taken from the operating system) and specify the Panda Safe Web extension options settings for your browser, which allows you to organize safer browsing. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vz/au/go/vzaugoad13rdrvgr-vnylginbua.jpeg"><br><br>  After that, the online installer begins the process of installing the product on your computer, during which it downloads all the necessary additional files from the cloud.  It is for this reason that an Internet connection is required to install the product. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/h8/m8/1s/h8m81s0ikjeaavquyqij4n72yoq.jpeg"><br><br>  Although standard offline distributions of more than 60 MB are available, which can be installed without the Internet, the convenience of the online installer lies in the fact that when using it you are guaranteed to receive the latest version of the product. <br>  I must say that the installation was quick and without any problems.  By the way, if your PC has the .NET Framework version lower than 4.6, then during the installation you will be asked to update its version. <br><br>  After installing the product, you will be asked to enter your Panda account, which is linked to an email address.  You can either immediately create a new account (if you don‚Äôt have one yet or need to bind the license to a new email address), or specify an existing account and log in to it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/m-/31/pa/m-31pajlrpaq6xemcqp1fc6vhfc.jpeg"><br><br>  We have indicated your existing account and tied this product to it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/2k/bo/xa/2kboxa3j_y06w84783neabsitm4.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/yu/bz/fr/yubzfrm180elqwvgaiodtvagfxc.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/lf/ok/m3/lfokm30w0klbyjsog2fvoahstby.jpeg"><br><br>  After installation, you can also activate your product with an activation code (if you have previously purchased it), or you can continue using the product as a free trial version. <br><br>  Since  we tied the product to an existing account, then we decided to activate Panda Dome to use the activation code from the paid product Panda Global Protection 2017, and therefore we received a new Panda Dome Complete with an almost complete arsenal of protection modules and services. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/9e/nf/6t/9enf6tpnbj0mlroh1vbt87pl5nk.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/a_/6c/as/a_6casrdtdgc94ttounf3jrpbfm.jpeg"><br><br><h4>  <b>Interface</b> </h4><br>  The first thing you immediately notice in Panda Dome is the new modern design, which, in our opinion, has become more comfortable.  And, despite the fact that, on the whole, the arrangement of elements repeats the previous line, access to modules and services in the new Panda Dome has become easier. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/hw/x8/96/hwx896ikjjsbi7z5xyt96nhrtp0.jpeg"><br><br>  For example, all modules are available directly from the main window. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/j0/o1/z3/j0o1z39hwj37ileggmldsmf3zei.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zb/rs/ip/zbrsipfakao1fkugkhk60ne1dta.jpeg"><br><br>  In the upper left corner a standard button with horizontal bars appeared to display the service menu instead of the Start button in the previous line, which looked somewhat out of place and incomprehensible.  And if you are inside a partition, the Back button is always shown in the upper left corner to return to the previous window. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wk/20/25/wk2025gcorckirmxz2wh57betnk.jpeg"><br><br>  At the top of the window in the center is the product name of Panda Dome, by clicking on which you can always immediately return to the main interface window.  In the upper right corner is the account icon, when clicked, you can go to your account or open the <b>My Products</b> section. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rv/eq/hh/rveqhhs2rtvevjgfgtxe3rkgyj4.jpeg"><br><br>  Next to the account icon is the notification icon.  When new notifications, warnings or reminders are available, this icon will inform you about it with its modified appearance.  Clicking on the icon opens a window with available notifications. <br><br>  The creeping line with the latest news from the Panda Security Media Center is located at the bottom. When you click on it, you will be taken to a window with announcements of the latest news on information security. <br><br>  Separately, of course, I want to say about the background design of the main window.  If all the other solution windows remained in a businesslike and strict design, then in the new Panda Dome the main window has a beautiful background that immediately attracts attention and tries to convey the most pleasant feelings to you.  At the same time, it is possible to change the background image in the product settings and enable the option of automatically changing the background of the application. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qy/ui/kf/qyuikfeqhk_sgvr0g8mkjorihw4.jpeg"><br><br>  In addition, the interface is based on new modern technologies, which allows it to work more quickly, which is really noticeable compared with the previous line. <br><br><h4>  <b>Basic Security Modules for Windows</b> </h4><br>  To write this review article, we used the Panda Dome Complete tariff plan (we will tell you more about the composition of the plans at the end of the article), within which almost all the functionality of the new solution became available. <br><br>  So, here are the main security modules: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>Antivirus</b> - offers automatic protection against all types of threats, including viruses, trojans, cryptographers and other malicious programs <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>Firewall</b> - protects your computer from hacker intrusions and attacks <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>Data protection</b> - monitors the access of certain applications to protected folders and files, providing protection from unknown cryptographers <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>Application Control</b> - allows you to configure allowed and restricted applications <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>Safe browsing</b> - additionally protects the user when browsing sites on the Internet <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>Process Monitor</b> ‚Äî analyzes computer-active processes. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>VPN</b> - a built-in utility that allows access to the Internet through secure proxy servers, providing privacy and additional protection from hackers and other intruders <br><br><h4>  <b>Antivirus</b> </h4><br>  This module offers protection against all types of threats, including viruses, trojans, cryptographers, and other malicious programs using all available techniques: cloud knowledge base, Collective Intelligence, local signatures, cloud heuristics, behavioral protection, technology to protect against exploits. <br><br>  The very first icon in the main window allows you to open the option of checking the PC on demand. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/td/lx/ye/tdlxyez6qlrwdsknmkfdvej_99u.jpeg"><br><br>  Panda Dome offers three types of scanning: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>Critical zones</b> for quick check of memory, current processes, cookies, etc.  Scanning is quite fast, allowing you to check the main system elements that are more likely to be infected. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>Full scan</b> allows complete and comprehensive verification of the entire PC. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>Custom scan is</b> designed to scan individual folders and files. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wr/ir/d5/wrird5x-mhvq7tbe3xyy7vmie-i.jpeg"><br><br>  When you start a scan, a corresponding window opens in which information is displayed about the scanned object and the total number of scanned objects and detected threats.  You can pause the check at any time or cancel it.  There is also an option to automatically turn off the computer after the scan is completed, which is very convenient if you, for example, set to check PCs at night and quietly went to bed.  The option "show details" shows additional information with the ability to go to the full report. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rt/hc/fn/rthcfncucvgvna7mzimpnfo7tl4.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/4q/m4/9e/4qm49ejukyxdx50tbhzksdciry4.jpeg"><br><br>  Clicking on the <b>Anti-Virus</b> icon in the main window opens a window with brief information about the results of the last scan by request, the presence of scheduled scans, the status of quarantine.  Also in this window is a brief statistic of detection of different types of threats for the current day, week, month or all the time with the possibility of moving to a detailed report. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ct/5u/xy/ct5uxyw6eex7mgqa_66okytlj6i.jpeg"><br><br>  The antivirus module allows you to manage a number of settings for detecting and blocking threats.  Depending on the settings you choose, Panda Dome can block potentially unwanted programs, analyze the behavior of applications and processes, and block them depending on the behavior model.  You can also specify the maximum allowed time interval during which Panda Dome will wait for the result of additional analysis from the cloud before allowing the launch of this process. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/6r/ay/4b/6ray4bbstlhxl7n9he7wtvks1gg.jpeg"><br><br>  In addition, you can configure the frequency of cleaning quarantine, as well as specify files, folders and extensions that will be excluded from anti-virus checks.  If you consider any of them to be exactly safe and reliable, then excluding them from the scan, you can significantly reduce the time required to perform a deep scan of your PC, although you must be extremely careful when setting exclusions so that it does not affect the decrease in security.  Here you can also manage exceptions for objects restored from quarantine. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/af/q_/33/afq_33crnuhhhsvkacsiixl5lro.jpeg"><br><br><h4>  <b>Firewall</b> </h4><br>  Another extremely important protection module that is difficult to manage without is a <b>firewall</b> that protects your PC against hacker intrusions and attacks. <br><br>  It should be noted that, like other protection modules, the firewall works in an automated mode, and therefore it is extremely easy to use and configure.  This module allows you to configure firewall rules for each application you use, allowing or disabling its connections using computer ports.  In addition, the firewall offers a set of rules recommended by the manufacturer, although their priority in any case will be lower than that of the user rules. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/1d/kh/1k/1dkh1kkrnjofvt-y3vgvqcnst68.jpeg"><br><br>  By default, the firewall independently sets the rights to incoming and outgoing connections for each application depending on the degree of its reliability, peculiarities of its operation and many other parameters.  Therefore, if you are not an advanced user, you may well rely on the default settings.  Otherwise, you can always customize any rule, add a new one or delete an unnecessary one, and also place them in order of priority. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/p3/8j/01/p38j01o9qf7attvlf-x0cyrtaqi.jpeg"><br><br>  In addition, Panda Dome offers a static rule-based intrusion prevention system.  By default, almost all of these rules are enabled, but you can always customize whether each rule is turned on or off (if you understand this). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/he/pe/-b/hepe-bn7vxwdgek_f1kyjckbemu.jpeg"><br><br>  It must be said that this intrusion protection is highly effective: all the attacks we simulated against computers with the Panda Dome installed were stopped before we could gain control of the devices. <br><br>  The Firewall module also allows you to choose one of three basic ways to connect to the Internet: at home, at work, or in a public place.  Depending on this, the firewall rules may change, allowing it to be more aggressive, for example, when connecting to the Internet via free WiFi in a cafe.  The module also shows statistics on blocked processes and intrusions with the ability to go to a detailed report of the firewall operation. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/h-/tm/m6/h-tmm69c3qjeekubqq18yezxhc4.jpeg"><br><br>  So if you are afraid of hackers and you need an application to protect against them with the possibility of very simple setup, then a firewall in Panda Dome would be the best option. <br><br><h4>  <b>Data protection</b> </h4><br>  The <b>Data Protection</b> module controls the access of certain applications to protected folders and files, providing protection from unknown encrypters.  This module is really extremely effective: an unknown cryptographer, even if it is not blocked for some reason, simply cannot physically access your data file, and therefore encrypt it. <br><br>  By default, when installing Panda Dome, this module is turned off, and therefore we highly recommend to activate it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ph/l-/ht/phl-htgze2wq-w9w5_vyqw7sc5s.jpeg"><br><br>  The settings of this module allow you to specify folders with user data and file extensions that must be further protected.  Among the latter, almost all the most commonly used types of user files are offered by default (archived formats, MS Office documents, images, sound and video files), but you always have the opportunity to add, change or delete something. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gp/o8/h-/gpo8h-lmyopn0_fsogqjr0latgm.jpeg"><br><br>  In addition, you can specify which applications are allowed to work with protected objects, and which are not.  As a rule, such a list is generated automatically, but you always have the opportunity to add, change or delete. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/oq/yo/kb/oqyokbz4mognwwawi_lfgqt_tum.jpeg"><br><br>  There is also a convenient option to configure the module for unknown applications: depending on the setting, when an unknown application tries to access protected objects, Panda Dome may ask you for permission to access or automatically block such attempts. <br><br>  In addition to this, the Data Protection module shows a brief statistic of the last blocked attempts to access protected objects with the ability to view a more detailed report. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/b_/zk/p8/b_zkp8turl3vufglboxktqr48tu.jpeg"><br><br><h4>  <b>Application control</b> </h4><br>  Another extremely useful and efficient module that provides a high level of PC security.  It allows you to specify which applications are allowed to run and which ones are not.  It also allows you to protect your PC from unknown online programs that can harm it (and therefore you) harm it.  When you first launch Panda Dome, this module is turned off by default, although you can quickly and simply turn it on.  After this, the module automatically starts its work, blocking prohibited applications. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/mb/vt/nf/mbvtnf1npgdjkpfbx2ua_gyvfcc.jpeg"><br><br>  The list of allowed and prohibited applications is formed in various ways, including automatic mechanisms of formation, but again you always have the opportunity to add or remove required applications on your own, as well as change the rights of previously configured applications.  In addition, you can always customize the operation of the module with respect to unknown applications: in this case, Panda Dome will either ask for your decision or automatically block their attempts to launch. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/oz/wz/3r/ozwz3rafb1ax09asw-jfunzgt60.jpeg"><br><br>  For verification, we decided to ban the harmless WordPad.  After that, Panda Dome immediately responded to the attempt to launch it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/yg/ks/m0/ygksm0iimproqrgbhwru-7fscie.jpeg"><br><br>  The <b>Application Control</b> module also shows a brief statistic of the last blocked attempts to launch prohibited applications with the ability to view a more detailed report. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zw/rs/qf/zwrsqfcodokcrh0enyp6zrblnpa.jpeg"><br><br><h4>  <b>Secure browsing</b> </h4><br>  Another easy-to-configure, but very useful web protection feature in the Panda Dome, which allows you to safely visit various websites.  In the event that the site is infected with malware or viruses, this module will automatically block access to it.  The <b>Safe Browsing</b> module also protects you from phishing attacks thanks to a huge database of phishing sites, which is updated in real time from the cloud. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rm/c4/g3/rmc4g34698ri5fvkqgthz4txt_k.jpeg"><br><br>  This module works almost completely in automatic mode, I suggest the user only the ability to add allowed addresses and domains. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/cq/ce/jz/cqcejzywfrt870s9is3bqbdbpva.jpeg"><br><br><h4>  <b>Process monitor</b> </h4><br>  Surely you always wondered what was happening in the background when you were using a PC.  Panda Dome as part of the <b>Process Monitor</b> module offers detailed reports on all ongoing processes.  It also monitors processes that are dangerous to your computer.  All processes are divided into several sections.  The most dangerous processes are highlighted in red and blocked. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vk/x3/ty/vkx3tynchejljzcdv__8ntbqqm4.jpeg"><br><br>  In the detailed report on each process, you can check its classification and status with the possibility of its manual blocking / unlocking, as well as view all the web addresses to which this process was connected. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ih/cc/te/ihcctezewovwtlqef2nsmp3e4z4.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/4n/th/fv/4nthfvywmwm3ky7j15nx_zi7nk4.jpeg"><br><br><h4>  <b>VPN</b> </h4><br>  In home antivirus Panda has a new built-in <b>VPN</b> module, which allows you to secure connections and prevent them from being intercepted by both intruders and controlling state authorities.  This module uses data encryption techniques, as well as the ability to select a secure proxy server in one of the 20 countries represented (there is a Russian proxy in the list).  The last option only works if you have a premium version of this module connected.  Our testing has shown a very high speed without any noticeable impact on the speed of opening sites and downloading. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qr/tr/un/qrtrunessb3yw1sjlukvv2aihpw.jpeg"><br><br>  In fact, the only drawback of the free version of this module is the limit on daily traffic: 150 MB per day.  It is clear that with such a volume you can‚Äôt pump up much and play a lot, but it can be quite enough for working with social networks and browsing websites.  But in the premium version there are no restrictions on traffic. <br>  By the way, what is interesting is that even with a VPN connection through a proxy server located in Russia, resources and instant messengers that were blocked on the territory of the country were still available. <br><br>  Like other protection modules, VPN works automatically and offers users only a few options: enable VPN after restarting the PC, automatically establish a VPN connection when connected to an unsafe WiFi network (we recommend using it, because sometimes you may forget or not notice that your laptop has connected to the public network), and if there is a premium version, you can choose a proxy server located in a particular country. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/5z/v7/no/5zv7no-aiufsyqwvkngkgcgio_m.jpeg"><br><br><h4>  <b>Additional functionality</b> </h4><br>  Complex security solutions differ from free and paid basic solutions in the presence of a number of additional features and services.  Panda Dome is no exception: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ USB protection <br>  ‚Ä¢ Recovery Kit <br>  ‚Ä¢ WiFi protection <br>  ‚Ä¢ Parental control <br>  ‚Ä¢ PC Cleanup <br>  ‚Ä¢ Anti-theft <br>  ‚Ä¢ Online backup <br>  ‚Ä¢ Virtual keyboard <br>  ‚Ä¢ File Shredder <br>  ‚Ä¢ File Encryption <br>  ‚Ä¢ Password Manager <br>  ‚Ä¢ My devices <br>  ‚Ä¢ My products <br>  Let's try to briefly review these functions. <br><br>  <b>USB protection</b> <br><br>  Considering the fact that often many threats are spread due to the automatic launch function of connected USB devices, and the vast majority of ordinary PC users never turn off this feature (they don‚Äôt know where it is located in Windows, and many of them do not even suggest that it can be), this module truly becomes extremely useful.  We all use flash drives, and almost every one of us knows that the problem of flash drives for PC is akin to the importance of safe sex.  And here comes the <b>USB Protection</b> module. <br><br>  Its main function is just a <b>simple and visual disabling autorun flash drives</b> .  This allows you to almost completely eliminate the possibility of automatic infection of the system from the flash drive.  In addition, the module is able to offer additional verification of each flash drive connected to the PC before opening it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/p-/vz/zb/p-vzzbalm-n2sb3o06r6gfq6vaa.jpeg"><br><br>  The module also allows you to automatically vaccinate each flash drive connected to a PC, as a result of which such a vaccinated flash drive will not automatically start on any other PC (no matter what antivirus is there and whether the autorun option is disabled), and therefore it will be less at risk be infected.  If there is no such need, then you can vaccinate the required flash drive manually: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ex/d_/dc/exd_dca4lg1ezyxiaqdtnubnqlo.jpeg"><br><br>  <b>Recovery kit</b> <br><br>  This functionality allows you to restore your PC in the event of an unexpected emergency, if the system was damaged as a result of an infection attempt or malicious attack.  We leave behind brackets how successful such attempts were, and what their probability is - as they say, and a stick shoots once in a lifetime, everything happens.  In any case, you need to insure and be able to not only prevent infection, but also quickly eliminate its consequences.  After all, the brakes were invented not for cowards, but for sensible people. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qj/if/vx/qjifvxazl6nf4ohqrgxz52rm_u0.jpeg"><br><br>  First, <b>Panda Cloud Cleaner</b> is part of the recovery kit - it is a special utility for detecting complex viruses and malware that cannot always be detected using standard techniques and options.  Therefore, if you have any doubts and you think that your PC may be infected, be sure to perform a deep scan using this utility.  Note that the scanning process can take several hours. <br><br>  Also, this module contains the option to create an emergency flash drive (similar to an emergency floppy disk or CD in previous years - oh, what were the times!).  Such a flash drive can be very useful if your PC cannot be booted.  In this case, it will be possible to boot the PC from the emergency flash drive, perform a deep scan of the PC using <b>Panda Cloud Cleaner</b> to remove traces of infection that prevent the system from booting. <br><br>  We tested the emergency flash drive on some blocked and damaged PCs.  The result was excellent: all PCs successfully booted after virus removal and system recovery. <br><br>  <b>Wifi protection</b> <br><br>  WiFi connections have become another weak link for mobile devices and laptops, especially when it comes to wireless connections in public places where there is a high probability of running into a Man-on-the-Middle attack or connecting to an infected or hacked router. <br><br>  Panda Dome, of course, has a <b>WiFi Protection</b> module on this account, which checks and protects wireless connections. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pz/xt/b0/pzxtb0ozrijhe3dxhquc0conqaw.jpeg"><br><br>  This module displays all devices connected to your WiFi network.  Thus, you have the opportunity to check if there are any ‚Äúextra‚Äù devices or uninvited guests on the network. <br><br>  In addition, this module provides the following features: <br><br>  <b>WiFi audit.</b> <br><br>  Performs a scan of wireless networks, performing a search for vulnerabilities, and provides recommendations for improving security.  As part of this analysis, the following aspects of the WiFi network are checked: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Network authentication and encryption <br>  ‚Ä¢ Computer-to-computer (ad hoc network) connections <br>  ‚Ä¢ Connection mode <br>  ‚Ä¢ Network name to avoid common names. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Signal level <br>  ‚Ä¢ Channel saturation <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/oi/2w/_-/oi2w_-y4p0ylbyysmbehdahx29u.jpeg"><br><br>  <b>Connection history</b> <br><br>  You can check which computers were connected to your network in the past, even if they are not currently connected to it.  This, in turn, also helps identify potential intrusions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qm/q3/pu/qmq3puhajub5ejgjfnumhvynoyk.jpeg"><br><br>  - Ability to easily identify computers by <b>alias</b> . <br>  - Ability to <b>block access of unknown computers to your computer</b> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/u5/a7/3b/u5a73bf_czei8sfn7z0vrwiysfm.jpeg"><br><br>  <b>Parental control</b> <br><br>  The importance of this module is difficult to overestimate, because  Its main goal derives directly from its name - to protect our children from you from the many dangers of the Internet.  Although the capabilities of the product allow you to restrict access to certain sites not only of children, but also of careless employees of small enterprises. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/o_/n7/11/o_n711jvo3o5vheed8vwn8ujyyu.jpeg"><br><br>  By default, this module is disabled, but it is very easy to turn it on.  For each account, you can view general and detailed statistics of visits to websites for a day, week or month, both by categories of sites, and directly at their addresses. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ud/al/um/udalum9oo7sjsettkz71rzfv9x0.jpeg"><br><br>  When an attempt is made to access a restricted site, a warning window pops up, and a standard ‚Äústub‚Äù with information about blocking is shown instead of the site content. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/t7/ro/bx/t7robxycd4pupgrm8nefqjh9hry.jpeg"><br><br>  This module is also configured quite simply, because  it is not overloaded with all sorts of options, which in most cases are not used.  For each account, you must configure which categories of sites are prohibited.  For ease of setup, you can use one of the predefined filters (for children, for teenagers, for employees), or create a personal filter or not use it at all. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/il/eu/rs/ileurs0h2ifvdmebhhktt6imkrk.jpeg"><br><br>  In addition, you can specify whether to deny access to unclassified pages, whose category is unknown.  You can also create lists of allowed and denied domains as exceptions to the applied filter. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/dc/qv/nn/dcqvnnlsomz9cq8lrkkybkapjqw.jpeg"><br><br>  <b>PC Cleanup</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/cy/bg/hq/cybghqpcjcis_2ttp2t87vnc3sy.jpeg"><br><br>  This module allows you to optimize the performance of your PC by increasing its speed by defragmenting, as well as freeing up space on your hard disk by deleting unnecessary files (temporary files, temporary Internet files, browsing history and cookies). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gu/v1/17/guv1172ig0pibj2i39rbqzvce_i.jpeg"><br><br>  Panda Dome features allow you to schedule your PC cleaning tasks. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/0k/o4/i3/0ko4i3kvfawn2tguhbpsw4wmbuy.jpeg"><br><br>  In addition to this, this module provides you with the following functions: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>Download Manager</b> .  Allows you to view programs in startup and, if necessary, disable extras.  Panda Dome continuously monitors the computer and warns you if any program tries to add itself to startup. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/n_/vo/zk/n_vozkinrzycuojbd8bde60raci.jpeg"><br><br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>Cleaning the registry.</b>  Removes corrupted and unwanted registry keys that may cause the operating system to crash <br>  Cleaning system settings allow you to create system restore points before performing cleaning tasks, create files with an extended report, and show various warnings. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xv/d8/t-/xvd8t-pkmja_yd1rfqzut_2oafq.jpeg"><br><br>  <b>Anti-theft for Windows devices</b> <br><br>  The <b>Anti-theft</b> module allows you to remotely find and track your Windows mobile devices that have your Panda Dome license installed via the Anti-theft module directly in the solution itself or through your Panda account. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/cu/af/bn/cuafbnqctild8ljbbhengkboero.jpeg"><br><br>  <b>Online Backup</b> <br><br>  This module allows you to set up automatic backup of the required files and folders to the secure <b>Mozy</b> online storage.  Under the Panda Dome license, 2 GB of space is provided.  For ease of use, you can download a small utility on your PC, with which you can easily manage backup. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xn/ch/0j/xnch0jchyxwyzxtushahzgju19g.jpeg"><br><br>  <b>Virtual keyboard</b> <br><br>  In recent years, attacks that use keyloggers to track keystrokes on your PC have become widespread.  Imagine that you are connected to your online bank, and the hacker has managed to track which keys you pressed when entering your password.  In this case, the hacker will be able to use this information to connect to your account and steal your money. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/_w/5g/jc/_w5gjcymkokx8zhz9ihqdaxhdhw.jpeg"><br><br>  In this case, the use of a virtual keyboard will allow you to almost completely avoid tracking by keyloggers. <br><br>  Virtual keyboard settings allow you to enable simultaneous display of multiple cursors, so that you cannot track keystrokes visually, or not to show keystrokes at all. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/9p/c0/w1/9pc0w1is_0sqvcmztciay8r57m8.jpeg"><br><br>  <b>File Shredder</b> <br><br>  This utility allows you to completely physically delete files from your hard drive without the possibility of their recovery. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/lr/hq/7j/lrhq7j_nloxwc9wzvdueozjjygc.jpeg"><br><br>  <b>File Encryption</b> <br><br>  A relatively simple utility for encrypting folders and files using special algorithms.  This feature will be especially useful for laptop users, since  in case of loss or theft of your mobile device, they will be able to prevent unauthorized persons from accessing their confidential information.  Encrypted files can only be decrypted using this utility, provided that you know the password for decryption. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/mh/kz/9d/mhkz9dshjqbv1irqjzdthdq_nso.jpeg"><br><br>  When encrypting, you must specify (and confirm) the password, as well as configure additional options (whether to delete the original files, to encrypt as a self-extracting archive, or to save the password in the password manager). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jx/4i/t3/jx4it3oli8owqtrtsjgv-bbo1ck.jpeg"><br><br>  At the same time, it is possible to generate a random password with a number of options. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/5z/mk/qh/5zmkqhrpxlx8oteenljwtd-kuom.jpeg"><br><br>  <b>Password Manager</b> <br><br>  Another very useful utility that allows you to manage passwords for all your accounts, providing the possibility of automatic authorization.  It is no secret that it is not recommended to use the same password to access various online services and accounts, but, on the other hand, it is extremely difficult to remember all these passwords.  In this case, the <b>Password Manager</b> will help you; when using it, you will need to remember only one master password to access this module, and it will encrypt and remember all other passwords itself.  In addition, with the help of this utility you can create any, the most complex passwords that cannot be picked up within a reasonable time. <br><br>  <b>My devices</b> <br><br>  This functionality allows you to connect to the list of your mobile devices (Windows, Android, iOS) that use Panda Dome licenses associated with your account. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/om/lg/uw/omlguwctnvrdg7pmctf5qobdzno.jpeg"><br><br>  Within this interface, you can check the operation status of these devices and their location (taking into account the geolocation information provided by the provider, mobile operator, the device itself), and in the case of Android devices, you can perform a number of remote tasks: take photos, block the device, clear information on the device, turn on the alarm on the device, untie the device from the license. <br><br>  <b>My products</b> <br><br>  This section allows you to manage your licenses: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ A list of licenses associated with your account, with detailed information on each of them. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Ability to add new licenses <br>  ‚Ä¢ Ability to change the tariff plan <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/8w/wj/op/8wwjopqtil655zxvm6gqet5kjyk.jpeg"><br><br>  <b>Security news</b> <br><br>  The corresponding section of the Panda Dome interface (as well as the running text at the bottom of the interface) displays news announcements from the Panda Information Security Media Center: information on threats, security tips, new technologies, news and events, PandaLabs reports and much more. <br><br>  <b>Android Protection</b> <br><br>  Panda Dome is a multi-platform solution, offering also very light and functional protection for Android.

Available for all operating systems Windows, Android, Mac iOS. This add-on will be available soon.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Sales of the Panda Dome solution in Russia and the CIS countries will begin in the coming month. At the moment, Russian prices have not yet been determined, although most likely they will be approximately in the same ranges as the previous line of 2017: for example, Panda Antivirus Pro, equipped with antivirus and firewall, for 1 year, 3 devices now cost 1200 rubles.</font></font><br><br><h4>  <b>Conclusion</b> </h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The new Panda Dome solution continues the best traditions of previous Panda home product lines, providing easy, effective and easy-to-use protection. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The ease of installing the agent allows him to work seamlessly even on older computers with Windows XP. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The effectiveness of the solution is due to the high level of protection against new and unknown threats. In particular, the famous events of 2017 with new viruses showed that Panda users were reliably protected from Petya, WannaCry and other lesser-known ‚Äúsurprises‚Äù.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The effectiveness of the solution is also confirmed by the high results that Panda demonstrates in comparative tests, for example, AV-Comparatives: over the past years, Panda has shown the best results every month in the most serious real-world protection testing Real-World Protection Test, winning gold in 2017 medal.</font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/kf/gq/b9/kfgqb9_cj2ssebaspjc8fqbubr8.jpeg"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Home antivirus Panda created on the principle of "Install and forget." </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">First of all, it is intended for ordinary users who do not need hundreds of different options for fine manual adjustment - they need a product that will provide easy and reliable effective protection that does not require any particular attention and does not interfere with your business (walk on sites, watch movies, listen to music, work with documents). </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Ideally, the user should forget about the fact that he has an antivirus installed. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">So if for you the main thing is not checkers, but to go, then the Panda antivirus is perhaps the best option.</font></font></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/354090/">https://habr.com/ru/post/354090/</a></p>
