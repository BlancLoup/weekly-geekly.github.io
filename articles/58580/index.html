  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Why don't you love them?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  For more than half a year I am interested in one question concerning the inhabitants of Habra.  And as I now have the opportunity to put it to you, I will not fail to take advantage of it. <br><br>  Tell me - why do you so dislike the creators of Vkontakte, Odnoklassniki, Studio them.  Lebedeva, along with their creations?  Why, when listing sources for an article, do you need to add a contemptuous “for pro forma” clause to the item “Mangling”? <br>  I do not praise either these sites or their creators.  And everyone has questions.  But. ... Previously, people, leaving after a certain enterprise, almost certainly lost touch.  The addresses were changing, the phones were changing, the pieces of napkins were being destroyed, where they were recorded (do you really write them down on something else?) - now there is Vkontakte.  Previously, it was difficult to hear, somewhere even impossible, to find a man whom you last saw so 30 years ago, and you have no idea where he is.  And no address bureau to you (if there is such a thing at all now), no search will give anything.  And now - Odnoklassniki.  I myself observed how with their help there were those who seemed to be lost forever.  And you can write caustic comments as much as you like “to find an old classmate from big tits” - you will live to 60 years and then you will see everything in a completely different light.  I don’t mention here you know, because my opinion, as very close to Lebedev’s views on design, and in general on the visual component of life, will be too subjective. <br><br>  So about the main thing.  I have an opinion as to why it is considered a good form to write contemptuously about the above persons.  It seems to me that the main problem is that they are not with us.  Do not hang out at all sorts of meetings of startups, do not write on Habrahabr, in a word, not like everyone (who found it too pathetic, read again).  If Durov came here, wrote about the problem, asked for advice, unsubscribed about new updates on the site, or Tyoma, instead of his Zhzheshki, would regularly please us with his thoughts here - look, and start writing about them completely differently.  Yes, they used B kovodstvo, scolded for paid emoticons, but it was used constructive criticism, and not what it is now. <br>  Here remember - about what service / startup / site, the creator of which or the inhabitant of Habra, or announced it here, did you speak so sharply and categorically?  Yes, there is criticism, yes, there is a remark, and this is very, very good.  But it's not about that.  It seems to me that any startups that have achieved success and that are not connected with the community thread are doomed to a not-very-flattering assessment, regardless of their merits.  And the remark is especially critical - they succeeded, as the dead dog, as is known, does not kick.

      And further.  Do not take the post as a personal insult or attempt to insult the community.  If you thought that somewhere I made a disrespectful tone, I apologize in advance.  Remember - there are no offensive questions - there are offensive answers to them. <br><br>  I really wonder why. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/58580/">https://habr.com/ru/post/58580/</a></p>
