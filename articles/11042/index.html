Nevertheless, qualitative and quantitative changes have taken place on both projects.  Let's try to analyze them. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/2ec/e84/2c5/2ece842c56ab1999e4d64bd168fd7a3c.jpg" width="229" height="37" hspace="10" vspace="10"><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <strong>1. <a href="http://www.vkontakte.ru/">vkontakte.ru</a></strong> <br>  At the moment, a clear leader.  Besides the fact that there are almost a million users on VKontakte, according to alexa.com, this is one of the fastest growing projects on the Internet.  <a href="http://vkontakte.ru/id1">Pavel Durov</a> loves to quote the results of TOPa just statistics alexa.com, but let's still really look at things, alexa.com - American service, and we are in Russia;) <br><br>  <strong>- What has been fixed?</strong> <br><blockquote>  Pavel, thank God, quite often and accurately notifies us about all the corrections and innovations that the guys from fakultet.ru do not do :( Thank you for that! </blockquote><br>  - According to the data from Pavel‚Äôs blog, it can be understood that the guys are really working on the search, improving it, updating it, optimizing it. 
      <br>

      - Vkontakte captured boom nicknames, users enter in the name and their nickname in the network.  Which greatly complicates the search.  However, the developers quickly added an additional field in the settings. <br><br>  - Constantly there is a struggle with the faculties, duplicates, schools ala "higher school nakurku" in the Netherlands and so on.  In fact, this is quite ridiculous, the experience of odnoklassniki.ru is repeated, where there are a lot of duplicates and a bunch of non-existent schools.  Personally, I think that there should be no post-moderation, but pre-moderation.  However, this is just my opinion :) <br><br>  <strong>- What was added?</strong> <br>  It is much more interesting here, since the new is always more interesting :) <br><br>  - Status. <br>  A certain ‚Äústatus‚Äù was added, when any user can either enter their current status, or specify one of the ready ones (ala ‚Äúsleep,‚Äù ‚Äúhome,‚Äù ‚Äúwork,‚Äù etc.).  Such a kind of breed on icq-status.  I personally did not think that it would be claimed.  But when I tried, it turned out really interesting. <br>  <em>The status is a full copy of the status on facebook.com</em> <br><br>  - Voting. <br>  ‚ÄúVoting‚Äù blocks were added to the groups.  Quite an interesting thing, but its placement - in the center, in my opinion is not appropriate.  Voted always (in the history of Ineta) was in the menu, on the side.  She did not distract attention and did not separate people from content.  However, it turned out quite fun, although it is quite useless. <br><br>  - Video. <br>  Quite recently, <a href="http://vkontakte.ru/blog.php%3Fnid%3D52">Pavel announced</a> the creation of a new thing ‚ÄúMy Videos‚Äù.  He promised to "understand" any modern video formats and upload videos up to 100 megabytes.  However, just a few hours after the announcement of this innovation, the menu item ‚ÄúMy Videos‚Äù disappeared: ((However, the news still hangs ... Can they do it anyway? <br><br>  - Birthdays. <br>  Parallel to the launch of the Video, Pavel said that now it would be possible to learn about the upcoming birthdays of friends from his profile.  But, to be honest, no matter how I looked, I didn‚Äôt find anything similar ... Maybe there‚Äôs just no one else in the near future. <br><br>  Missed nothing? <br><br>  <strong>2. <a href="http://www.fakultet.ru/">fakultet.ru</a></strong> <br>  The guys from the faculty are not lagging behind, but so far only in quality ... I think they have problems in numbers :) However, their hands do not fall, this is evident. <br><br>  <strong>- What has been fixed?</strong> <br><blockquote>  There is much more difficult, because the developers practically do not tell us about the innovations.  At least the way I would like.  No, of course <a href="http://www.fakultet.ru/blog">Danya keeps us informed</a> , but rather poorly. </blockquote><br><br>  - The guys changed the main skin, down to the color.  At first it seemed to me that the color was stupidly borrowed from vkontakte.ru, however, after a detailed analysis;))) it turned out that it was a completely different color, albeit a blue one.  But not the point.  Skin powder, make up cosmetics.  It became more attractive <br><br>  - I noticed that when searching for people, the photos became a little more, like on vkontakte.ru again.  It has become more comfortable and more pleasant.  Although a full photo appears on fakultet.ru when you hover in the name of a person, it‚Äôs still more convenient to look at the person‚Äôs face when looking for people, and not because it was. <br><br>  <strong>- What was added?</strong> <br>  - Status. <br>  Similarly, the status of a person was added.  However, if vkontakte.ru stupidly licked from a <a href="http://www.facebook.com/">big brother</a> , the guys from the faculty made efforts and they turned out to be a little different from the facebook status.  As a Facebook user, I was at first a bit unaccustomed to using status at the faculty, but then it seemed even quite fun.  The main trick is the watch next to the status, which is updated every second and shows the exact time, how many people have already spent in this status :))), in the spirit of ‚ÄúMitya at the moment WC (already 03:11:21)‚Äù :)) <br><br>  - Presents. <br>  The guys also introduced Gifts similar to Facebook.  Even the pictures of the gifts themselves from there.  There are, of course, their own.  In the spirit of ‚ÄúKick me‚Äù or ‚ÄúBring the bear‚Äù :)) At first, only shareholders and, accordingly, shares could pay for gifts.  At 20 shares per gift.  But then the guys introduced <a href="http://www.fakultet.ru/blog%3Ftid%3D185">SPOKI</a> , and this is generally funny :))) After reading the <a href="http://www.fakultet.ru/spok">text about SPOKH,</a> they tried to get me out from under the table for a long time.  As a true habrist, I am sure that the reason for the appearance of SPOKOV is a UFO, without any BUT.  One spot - one gift.  And the SPOKI can be earned by inviting people through your ref links and on soap, the gifts came to life :)) <br><br>  - Birthdays. <br>  As well as vkontakte.ru, the faculty introduced a birthday reminder service.  Even wash before VKontakte.  It turned out they are easier - you can immediately see how and what, you can look at the calendar of birthdays for the whole year, conveniently.  Especially with the advent of gifts, this is quite relevant. <br><br>  - News feed. <br>  I think in general the main introduction for this time.  The news feed is like a log of you and your friends ( <em>full analog of facebook.com</em> ).  What did you do, what pictures of comments, where you left a record, where you uploaded the photo, who gave a gift to itp.  Accordingly, you can watch the tape of friends.  What they did, where they commented that they looked.  Very comfortably. <br><br>  And here I didn‚Äôt miss anything ... <br><br>  <em>Now I would like to say a word about both projects.</em>  <em>Personally, I prefer facebook.com, however I am registered here and there.</em>  <em>I will hide my profile for now, in order to conduct further analysis of these startups, I will continue to record all the innovations.</em>  <em>In general, it‚Äôs very nice to see projects of this level in runet and I can say 100% that I‚Äôll switch from Facebook to the faculty if they have as many users as VKontakte and I‚Äôm also sure that I‚Äôll switch to VKontakte if it comes to the faculty functionally.</em>  <em>Both do not have enough little things, to each his own, if you combine both projects, then you‚Äôll get what we‚Äôve been looking for for a long time, probably :)) Good luck to the developers and vkontakte.ru and fakultet.ru, and their happiness and health!</em> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/11042/">https://habr.com/ru/post/11042/</a></p>
