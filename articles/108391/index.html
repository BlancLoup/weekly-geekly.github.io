The whole section is devoted to why optimizers charge for traffic and position.  And there is not a word about taking payment for sales. <br><br>  If you look at the comments on the post <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/webprojects/blog/105573/">about the reasons for the distrust of SEO-schnick</a> , it becomes obvious that the masters, unlike many other clients of SEO-companies, understand that the position in the top and the amount of traffic is not an end in itself.  Online shopping traffic in FIG is not needed, if it does not give anything but server load.  He needs buyers.  Not "potential", but who went to the site and bought something.

      He is even willing to pay to attract customers.  But before giving money to ‚Äúseo-guys,‚Äù and maybe even before opening a store, you need to decide two things for yourself: <br><br><ul><li>  How to determine which marketing activities have affected sales growth? </li><li>  and generally how do you know what sales will be? </li></ul><br><a name="habracut"></a><h3>  How to track customers </h3><br>  For counting customers who have made an order through a form on the website, there is Google Analytics and Yandex.Metrica (which, by the way, recently had a most useful heat map of clicks).  For us, as an SEO company, it‚Äôs important to keep track of the people who led us.  Accordingly, we track what the buyer came to the search engine ‚Äî we count how many such people came before and determine the monthly increase. <br><br>  If we need to track the user's behavior on the site, for example, to understand the reason for the large number of failures - use eyetracking and mouse tracking, as well as conduct usability testing. <br><br>  But what about the orders that came by phone?  To ask the manager on the phone to record where the buyer came from - it is risky, often the manager just scores.  Therefore, the following control options are most often used. <br><br><ul><li>  <strong>Separate phone number on the site.</strong>  You will not be mistaken with the number of calls, but if you do not additionally pay for call recording, you will again have to ask the managers themselves to count how many orders have been processed from this number.  In addition, for each advertising campaign (to evaluate its effectiveness) will have to do a new number. </li><li>  <strong>Special software on the site</strong> ( <a href="http://reklamer.ru/">reklamer.ru</a> , <a href="http://adscontrol.ru/">adscontrol.ru</a> , as well as (proposed in the comments by the habraiser <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/n0_quarter/" class="user_link">n0_quarter</a> ) <a href="http://istat.com.ua/">istat.com.ua</a> ).  These are complex solutions - using virtual phone numbers, you can keep statistics on all channels for receiving orders and on all advertising campaigns.  Minus - a relatively high cost. </li><li>  <strong>Promotional codes.</strong>  Each advertising campaign includes a discount offer.  The customer calls and calls the promotional code to receive the discount.  Promotional codes for different campaigns, of course, are different.  Minus - you have to make a discount. </li></ul><br><h3>  How to track customers: an alternative </h3><br>  We have a client in WebProjects - <a href="http://www.cifroterra.ru/">DigitalTerra</a> , an online store of electronic equipment.  At some point, our relationship is deadlocked.  The client wanted to know what exactly he pays for, and what exactly he gets from it.  Then we suggested the following. <br><br>  We place on the site pages a ‚Äúclient code‚Äù unique for each visitor.  I‚Äôm dialing a request in Yandex, I go to the store‚Äôs website, I call the store - I‚Äôm asked to name the code located under the phone number on the store page.  I was counted, it is now known for certain on what request I came and what I bought. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/af7df3e2/c8191806/70d5972b/56f71680.png"><br><br>  The technique is not new, we picked it up from Alexey Ivanov from the Sinylok company.  Admittedly, thoughts are in the air, and recently we have witnessed the development of this idea.  Unfortunately, the author of this ingenious customer accounting system is not present on Habr√© (at least the search by company name did not give anything), so we will take the liberty to tell about his brainchild. <br><br>  At the last conference " <a href="http://conf.oborot.ru/">Electronic Commerce - 2010</a> " we got acquainted with the work of Timofey Shikolenkov.  On the first day, his website was lynched by usability and SEO experts.  And in the second, he read a report about web analytics of his online store, which he had tucked into his belt most of the Internet marketing gurus.  Immediately make a reservation, the <a href="http://www.audiomania.ru/">site</a> lynched for the cause.  But how statistics are maintained and how it helps increase sales deserves respect. <br><br>  The impetus for Timofey‚Äôs creation of his own web analytics system was the fact that a person, before buying something in a store, <strong>can go to the site ten times from different computers, phones and iPads, and then place an order by phone</strong> .  Google Analytics or Yandex.Metrica, firstly, will consider that these were all different people, and, secondly, will reduce the significance of requests and sources from which a person came in the first 9 times, and increase the significance of the request and source from which a person I came when I finally decided to make a purchase. <br><br>  The usefulness of the Google and Yandex services does not detract, but for a persistent and principled person it can be the reason for creating your own analytics system.  It is long, expensive, and that is why it is respected.  So what did Timothy. <br><br><ul><li>  as well as we, he began to place a unique code on the pages of the site - when the client called, the manager asked to call him these numbers, </li><li>  the store completely abandoned the counting of visitors and switched to counting living people, </li><li>  web statistics was integrated into CRM, </li><li>  The ‚Äúdossier‚Äù per client began to include all possible information: visits to the site from various sites, orders, letters, messages on the forum, calls, visits to the store, </li><li>  Now, when a customer calls the store, the manager simultaneously opens his ‚Äúdossier‚Äù and uses the information from it in the conversation. </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/a6cd2041/c41254c5/06be1b0b/92ce3ab5.png" alt="audiomania"><br><br>  One client may have several unique codes (ID), several IP or forum accounts.  Or vice versa, from one IP, a husband and wife could enter, for example, and this is also taken into account.  And most importantly, about the client (not about the abstract host) it is known that he was searching in the search engine and that he eventually bought it. <br><br>  Other examples of the work of this Big Brother with vivid screenshots can be found in the <a href="http://blog.webprojects.ru/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/3_6_2_shikolenkov_timofey.pdf">presentation of Timofey</a> . <br><br><h3>  I am ready to track customers.  Where are my sales? </h3><br>  Very often the client tells us that he wants an honest "affiliate program" and is ready to track customers.  If, at the same time, he cannot change the phone number on the site for six months or does not want to establish his own business processes - we will not succeed with him. <br><br>  Therefore, we have identified three factors for ourselves, on which it depends, whether we will work with sales. <br><br>  <strong>The first factor</strong> : the store has a working service.  The person your sales depend on is the one who picks up the phone when a customer cited by us calls the online store.  A dishonest or incompetent manager can kill 60-70% of orders. <br><br>  It is very easy to check it - call your shop under the guise of a customer, order ‚Äúsecret buyers‚Äù or install software that records telephone conversations. <br><br>  <strong>The second factor</strong> : the store sells usability.  If the user cannot add the item to the cart or does not understand that it has been added, the sales boom will not happen.  How to make the store convenient - we wrote in our blog <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/webprojects/blog/101061/">earlier</a> . <br><br>  <strong>The third factor</strong> : the store has competitive prices.  Roughly speaking, you need to answer the question, will anyone even buy these products and services at such a price?  We look at competitors, we follow the market - we draw conclusions. <br><br>  Behind this all.  Take care of yourself and attract buyers. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/108391/">https://habr.com/ru/post/108391/</a></p>
