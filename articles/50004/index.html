  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The weirdness of the WATrack module for Miranda on the example of PSI</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><h2>  Easy preface: </h2><br>  In connection with the recent problems with ICQ servers / protocols, I decided to smoothly overflow to Jabber, especially since I had wanted to do this for a long time and it was only prevented that there was no one in the ‚Äúworld‚Äù of Jabber, almost nobody (well, the unusual interface of the PSI downloaded for the test. About the support of the jabber protocol by the miranda, which I usually use - at that time did not know).  Now I decided not to reinstall the PSI client, but simply to set up the long-beloved Miranda.  But because of the lack of a jabber browser in it (maybe it didn‚Äôt find or didn‚Äôt install the necessary plugin) and the desire to work with it, it pulled out the downloaded PSI from the bins six months ago and installed it. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So here.  Miranda is in my pack and has a bunch of ryushechek, one of which is a plug-in / module "Winamp Track" (watrack.dll).  This module is quite common and allows you to follow the music that I listen to in various players and change my status by inserting information about the track there (the module does not even know how to work with loless music when the album is in the form of a single file and is split into auxiliary * .cue file). <br><h6>  <i>A little about one minus of the module itself: it does not work correctly with tags when listening to loless music, when the artist‚Äôs entire album is stored as a single file (disk image) and split into tracks in the auxiliary configuration * .cue file, which is fed to the player.</i>  <i>And despite the fact that the player equally calmly perceives and displays the metadata of individual mp3 tracks as well as those added via the * .cue file, in the second case, for some reason, the module of the Miranda each track names:</i> <i><br></i>  <i>"&lt;image file name&gt; - &lt;image file name&gt;", not "&lt;artist&gt; - &lt;track name&gt;"</i> </h6><br><br><h2>  Very strange </h2><br>  Despite the usual, he (toli module, toli PSI, I have not yet understood) was able to surprise me.  When I began to climb the settings and created a new account, PSI gave me a window with additional settings for the new account with the title ‚ÄúPSI: Account Properties‚Äù, which I was not too lazy to learn.  And what was my surprise (I even wanted to fall from the chair, but it didn‚Äôt), when I opened the Details tab and clicked the Select Key ... button there (in addition to an empty Psi window of choice, Kay) a pop-up window of my neglected Miranda, which the following text gave me: <br><pre>  Now listening: 
 Psi: Account Properties - Psi: Account Properties
 Genre:, with bitrate: 0 kbps </pre><br>  which has the following template in the WATrack Module settings: <br><pre>  Now listening:
 % artist% -% title%? iflonger (% album%, 0, (from "% album%"),) 
 Genre:% genre%, with bitrate:% bitrate% kbps </pre><br>  This one is thrown out by the Miranda mnu amused ... Moreover, the status in Miranda changed again to normal as soon as I closed the Secret Key window. <br>  The same "humor" was <br>  1. When I clicked ‚ÄúOk‚Äù on the ‚ÄúSecret Key‚Äù window when the key was not selected, as a result, I was informed about the error ‚ÄúPlease select a key‚Äù in the form of a dialog box and the name of the window was set as the name of the track and artist "Secret Key". <br>  2. When searching in the jabber browser (if the ‚ÄúAuto-browse into objects‚Äù option is disabled) of the gmail.com server and pop-up as a result of an error in the form of a dialog box. <br>  3. Then I began to pervert and realized that this is always the case when displaying auxiliary windows (in options, for example, when choosing a font). <br><br><h2>  Climax </h2><br>  1. I now wonder what applications this module Miranda behaves in this way. <br>  2. Is this fun fact known to the public? <br>  3. Is this somehow related to the default PSI ‚ÄúData Transfer Port‚Äù option set to ‚Äú8010‚Äù? <br>  4. Could this have, in addition to the pleasure character, also a malicious one?
