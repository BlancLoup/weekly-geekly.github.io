  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Impact of Motorola Mobility Absorption by IBM-Lenovo Alliance</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  When <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM">IBM</a> sold its Personal Systems Group to <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenovo">Lenovo</a> in 2005, these companies entered into a strategic alliance - see: <a href="http://www.ibm.com/ibm/ru/ru/pcannouncement/">‚ÄúIBM and Lenovo‚Äù</a> .  And by broad agreement, both these companies complement each other and can offer their customers through their distribution channels the products of both IBM and Lenovo. <br><br>  Not only that, since 2005, IBM owned a share of ~ 20% of Lenovo shares, then it really sold them to various American investment funds (but there are persistent rumors that IBM owns almost a blocking stake in Lenovo through its investment funds). <br><br>  The IBM-Lenovo strategic alliance is still active.  And on January 23, 2014, it was announced that a new deal was concluded, and according to it, IBM again receives Lenovo shares and further expands its relationship with this Chinese company - see: <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/210132/">‚ÄúIBM says goodbye to x86 servers, the entire line is sold to Lenovo</a> . <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/210132/">‚Äù</a> <br>  After this transaction, a number of articles and interviews appeared in which they are actively discussing how these two companies will sell each other‚Äôs equipment and products - mutually complementing and enriching each other: <br>  1. <a href="http://www.crn.ru/news/detail.php%3FID%3D88401">‚ÄúHow will the IBM-Lenovo deal affect the server and storage market?‚Äù</a> ; <br>  2. <a href="http://www.crn.ru/news/detail.php%3FID%3D88358">"IBM-Lenovo: what's next?</a>  <a href="http://www.crn.ru/news/detail.php%3FID%3D88358">Lenovo's channel chief responds</a> ; <br>  3. <a href="http://www.crn.ru/news/detail.php%3FID%3D88418">"The consequences of the transaction IBM-Lenovo</a> . <a href="http://www.crn.ru/news/detail.php%3FID%3D88418">"</a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In general, who bought whom is not even completely clear, because the IBM and Lenovo businesses are more and more intertwined :) <br>  I personally have the feeling that ‚ÄúLenovo‚Äù is such an IBM‚Äôs brand for the mass market ‚Äî for cheap mass-produced equipment. <br>  And in order not to stain and damage the elite of their native IBM brand - they try to distance themselves somewhat and in every possible way hide their close interweaving with Lenovo.

      After that, you can directly say that <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/210788/">Motorola Mobility was bought <b>by the IBM-Lenovo alliance</b></a> ! <br>  At the same time, IBM has in recent years been actively preparing for the widespread introduction of <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D1%2588%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25B9_%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BF%25D1%258C%25D1%258E%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580">tablets</a> and <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A1%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D1%2582%25D1%2584%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD">smartphones</a> into the corporate market (see: <a href="http://www.pcweek.ua/themes/detail.php%3FID%3D140438%26THEME_ID%3D13885">‚ÄúIBM enters the market of mobile corporate solutions‚Äù</a> ), where tablets and smartphones in many workplaces can replace desktops and <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25CD%25EE%25F3%25F2%25E1%25F3%25EA">laptops</a> . <br>  And now, after the purchase of Motorola Mobility by the IBM-Lenovo alliance, tablets and smartphones under the Motorola / Lenovo brand, with the help of IBM and Lenovo distributors, will actively move into the corporate market, where they can finally push BlackBerry out of this business - see: <a href="http://www.crn.ru/news/detail.php%3FID%3D88441">‚ÄúLenovo partners welcome the purchase Motorola Mobility</a> ! <br><br>  Well, it may seem simple to consumers that all these arguments are far from life (after all, many are not connected with large corporate business, and they do not encounter distributors). <br>  I think that it is very important to understand that such a major player in the IT market as <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM">IBM</a> essentially became an ally of <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google">Google</a> and chose to support smartphones and tablets on the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android">Google Android platform</a> - and this means that it will be this platform in the coming years invested billions of corporate money.  And perhaps it is on the tablets with the Google Android platform that corporate software will be transferred when switching from a Windows PC to a Tablet. <br><br>  The trend of switching from Windows PCs to Tablets is obviously increasing.  Of course there are jobs in corporations that are not possible to transfer to the tablets.  And the corporate market, this trend has so far affected to a lesser extent, but many corporations are already planning to move to the tablets. <br>  And the question arises: on which tablet will most of the corporations move from the PC to the platform? <br>  Today there are three main tablet platforms: <br>  1. <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android">Google Android</a> ; <br>  2. <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS">Apple iOS</a> ; <br>  3. <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_RT">Microsoft Windows RT</a> . <br>  And the last one is obviously lagging behind the tablet progress :( <br><br>  Yes, it should be noted that in recent years IBM has strongly supported the development of the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux">Linux</a> operating system, and in particular is actively implementing Linux on its corporate servers built on the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/POWER">POWER</a> processor platform, and now it is also becoming an active supporter of the Linux-like Google Android OS. <br><br>  It seems that Linux with Google Android will soon be ruled by at least the corporate world (which means the inevitable MS Windows - RIP). <br>  And of course, it‚Äôs obvious here that Google Android‚Äôs competitors on mobile platforms, first of all in the face of <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft">Microsoft</a> and <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple">Apple,</a> could suffer another defeat - now in the corporate market (they will probably soon forget about <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/BlackBerry_(%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F)">BlackBerry</a> - they‚Äôll lose everything or lose in the near future time), and perhaps they should somehow change their software platforms in the direction of greater friendliness and interaction with Google Android, and with other Linux platforms :) <br><br>  PS: What do you think about this? <br>  This is just my thoughts in the ear :) <br>  And do not kick me too hard for expressing my private opinion (if it does not coincide with yours) :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/211008/">https://habr.com/ru/post/211008/</a></p>
