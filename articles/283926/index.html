Make your community democratic. </h4><br>  In <i>FounderSociety</i> and <i>YEC</i> , current community members vote to adopt new ones.  This approach gives a feeling of comfort, stability and justice within the community, and also protects its exclusivity.  New or prospective members should have no doubt about the high value of your network.  Mutual trust from the very first day will show the level of your site. <br><br><h4>  2. Take care of what is already supervised. </h4><br>  Just because you have thousands of qualified community members does not mean that you have to introduce them all to each other.  Every entrepreneur needs only a handful of real people.  Consider the communication of community members, so that everyone is connected only with those people who really suits him the best way.

    <h4>  3. Focus on common interests. </h4><br>  Many people will want to be part of your network if they truly share your views.  Find people who are also worried about the future.  YEC invites its members to become mentors to the next generation of entrepreneurs.  A discussion often begins for this purpose. <br><br><h4>  4. Maximize access. </h4><br>  The more business connections you have available, the more opportunities there are to help others, and vice versa.  Provide your community with as much information, tools and services as possible.  You never know what little thing can change someone's career.  Get users to come to you to accelerate the achievement of their goals. <br><br><h4>  5. Drive on metrics and vanity. </h4><br>  If you do something only to attract traffic, it will not lead to anything good.  More meaningful results can bring the publication of truly intelligible content and sincere relationships, although this takes more time and effort. <br><br><h4>  6. Take some time to help others. </h4><br>  Your goal in any business should always guarantee the return on investment.  If you ask for time for your community, make sure that as a result it is not wasted.  To find out the most useful resources for each individual person, you need to devote some time to this. <br><br><h4>  7. Be proactive and personalized. </h4><br>  The difference between initiative and passive community management is the difference between success and failure.  You and your team should take care of users beyond sending invoices and handouts.  Whatever your users do, they need a precautionary attitude towards them.  As an example, the FounderSociety team acts as an ‚Äúextension‚Äù of the community member team.  They call their participants on a regular basis throughout the year to find out how to best serve them or improve their business. <br><br>  These are very important little things.  If you have made someone's life a little easier, your community has done its job.  With these little things in your pocket, you can build and grow a strong community in any industry. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/283926/">https://habr.com/ru/post/283926/</a></p>
