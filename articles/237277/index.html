  <section class="page js-page"><h1>My teaching experience</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><h4>  Hello </h4><br>  In this post I will talk about my teaching experience.  In particular, I will describe what mistakes I made and how I fixed it.  I will describe the methods I used for training, and I will also tell you about my plans for the current academic year. <br><br><h5>  Preface.  About me and how it happened </h5><br>  I work in a small company as a <s>programmer, in fact an</s> enikei <s>system administrator</s> .  At the beginning of 2014, I was approached from the technical school, who in the distant past graduated with a degree in ‚ÄúAccountant-economist‚Äù and offered to teach the accountants the subject of ‚Äú1C: Enterprise‚Äù.  With eyes of 5 <s>kopecks of</s> rubles for fear, I agreed. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  Process </h5><br><h6>  Start teaching </h6><br>  The beginning of teaching began with viewing and studying the information about what I should teach students.  In the training part I was provided with a curriculum, explained that students should know within the framework of the training module to which the subject belongs, but when I asked for teaching materials or any other materials used by previous teachers, I was told that there are none.  As it turned out, due to the rapid turnover of the teaching staff in this area, no materials remained.  This means that all tasks and materials need to be searched from scratch, so the next step I took was the acquisition of two books: <br><ul><li>  1C: Educational version; </li><li>  Business operations in 1C: Bukhalterii 8 (version 2.0).  Tasks, solutions, results. </li></ul><br>  On the basis of these books, I began to build classes. <br><br><h6>  Teaching </h6><br>  Part 0.

      For a start, I introduced tough discipline on pairs.  Phones at the beginning of the pair all add up to the 1st desk, after the call, no one enters.  All violations are punishable by sending for admission to class to the deputy.  Director of Academic Affairs. <br><br>  As a result, students were not distracted by their phones and at least a little were immersed in the learning process. <br><br>  Part 1. <br><br>  My beginning is my main mistake. <br><br>  The construction of classes was organized on the principle of Theory =&gt; Practice =&gt; Questions on the material passed. <br><br>  The theory was completely built as a lecture.  In the theoretical part, I told students about the principles of work in the program, what documents are used, what happens when documents are moved, fully believing that over the past year they learned accounting material (estimates in the journal spoke about learning the material), which means they understand what I'm talking about. <br><br>  In the practical part, they sat at the PC and, under the direction of the authorities, got documents into the information base, then got 2-3 documents of their own each.  With increasing knowledge, combinational tasks were given, with the application of all the passed documents.  At the end of the pair were asked test questions on the material covered, questions from students (if any) were heard. <br><br>  After 10 pairs (1/3 of all pairs) I did a test test of students' knowledge.  It included tests, knowledge of definitions, the solution of situational problems.  The maximum number of points was 100 for test work, 50 of them were satisfactory, 70 was good, 90 was excellent. <br><br>  The test and situational tasks included the knowledge of accounting and posting. <br>  Definitions only from 1C. <br>  The result shocked me. <br>  94% of the group failed the test, gaining an average of 23 points. <br><br>  Well, I'm in shock, but the conclusions are made. <br><br>  My mistake was to blindly believe that students had mastered material in other subjects (accounting). <br><br>  Conclusion and solution methods: <br><ul><li>  It is necessary to include in the theoretical part materials on the basics of accounting; </li><li>  It is necessary to include surveys at the beginning of the class in order to check the mastery of the theory of the previous lesson. </li></ul><br><br>  Part 2. <br><br>  Well, the conclusions are made, recycled material in pairs.  Now, training is conducted according to the Survey =&gt; Theory =&gt; Practice =&gt; Questions about the material covered. <br><br>  After another 10 pairs again control the test of knowledge.  The conditions are the same. <br><br>  Result: 62% failed the test - the average score was 30;  25% is satisfactory, 13% is good.  There are no excellent students. <br><br>  In the analysis of tests, it was revealed that the students began to understand the accounts, but they still don‚Äôt understand the transactions, and in a third I noticed an absolute lack of understanding of non-cash and cash. <br><br>  Situational tasks have shown that students can associate 2 operations in one, but they connect more than 3 operations with difficulty.  Having reviewed all the tasks, I realized that the lack of understanding of the entries affects the ability to verbally solve the problem. <br><br>  By definition, the result remains the same, more or less knew. <br><br>  Errors: <br><br><ul><li>  It became a lot of theory, from which students simply wrote, not remembering the material, and certainly not trying to understand it.  For answers during polls, they simply read a notebook in front of a couple and then forgot it; </li><li>  They learned the bills, but I didn‚Äôt teach them how to use them properly and make wiring; </li><li>  Not taught to navigate in business transactions; </li><li>  Practical problems are solved by a pattern, not understanding the principle of work.  The template is not remembered. </li></ul><br><br>  Findings: <br><br><ul><li>  It is necessary to produce theoretical material in a more accessible and memorable form; </li><li>  To convey to the students an understanding of the principles of the compilation of the postings, as from where it is taken, where and why it goes; </li><li>  Increase the decision of business transactions, with the preparation of entries and descriptions of documents that will be used to bring these operations into the program; </li><li>  Formation of patterns in the head for solving various economic problems. </li></ul><br><br>  Part 3 <br><br>  Having received, thanks to the second test, new data, I re-processed the material.  The process on the pair proceeded in the same way. Survey =&gt; Theory =&gt; Practice =&gt; Questions about the material covered, but now the theoretical and practical part has changed. <br><br>  In theory, the following changes occurred: <br><br><ul><li>  In the form of a lecture only basic concepts began to be issued; </li><li>  Documents and postings on them were issued in the form of diagrams that showed the process of a business transaction; </li><li>  Links to YouTube videos were given to the house on filling out certain documents in the program. </li></ul><br><br>  Practice: <br><ul><li>  Solving problems taken from life (for example, ‚Äúbuying bread‚Äù, in which the student and his family are an enterprise; the student needs to describe the process of buying bread by accounting entries and what documents they will use in 1C) with a detailed analysis of actions, what is taken from; </li><li>  Problem solving in the program, but when passing practical it is necessary to explain the course of actions to solve problems; </li></ul><br><br>  &lt;img src = " <img src="//habrastorage.org/files/241/c79/f28/241c79f28b744b75a15571b5f118575f.PNG">  " <br>  <i>Reflection scheme in 1C purchase of goods and materials</i> <br><br>  For 3 pairs before the end of the course, all the topics covered earlier were translated into a schematic view as above and a single presentation was made. <br><br>  Total. <br><br>  At the end of the course, students had a comprehensive examination in accounting and 1C, in which students had to solve a situational problem, first in accounting entries, then fill in the necessary documents in the 1C program, and then protect their decision in front of teachers. <br><br>  Result.  100% of the group passed the exam (2 people, of course, regretted it, pulled it out so as not to overwhelm), 37% of them gave a good mark. <br><br>  Findings. <br><br>  From this experience I made several conclusions: <br><br><ul><li>  Because of the human remuneration, many teachers do not ask the amount of information that follows, as a result, students behave more relaxed, they do not bother to study, because they know that they will be transferred anyway. </li><li>  For successful training of students there is no need to give them a large amount of information, most of which will be forgotten, it is better to give out basic knowledge, but in such a way that they are remembered most and are logically related - schemas and tables; </li><li>  Many articles describe that for successful learning a person needs to be interested.  It is impossible to interest a student, if you do not deprive the phone / tablet / laptop; </li><li>  A very good visual demonstration of solving problems in video tutorials. </li></ul><br><br>  In this academic year, I prepared a course of studies, taking into account all past mistakes. <br><br>  - Poll; <br>  - Theory: <br><ul><li>  basic mechanisms and concepts of the program; </li><li>  a schematic description of the processes; </li><li>  video demonstration; </li><li>  Test questions. </li></ul><br>  - Practice. <br><ul><li>  problem solving at the blackboard with a detailed analysis of the solution; </li><li>  problem solving in the program. </li></ul><br><br>  4 comprehensive checklists for assessing student learning. <br><br>  Thank you for your attention, I am ready to listen to constructive criticism and advice. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/237277/">https://habr.com/ru/post/237277/</a></p>
