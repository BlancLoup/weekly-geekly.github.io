  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Sundar Pichai: the human leader of Google</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Bruno Bowden, Data Collective's business partner and former chief engineer at Google Earth and Enterprise Gmail, spoke about Google leaders.  According to him, to become one of them, you need to be at least three times better developer than your colleagues.  Such technical skills in one person rarely coexist with emotional intelligence - the possibility of empathy.  Savants are very different from the average person. <br><br>  Sundar Pichai is a <a href="http://recode.net/2015/10/23/the-new-google-all-the-assholes-have-left/">rare exception</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/bdd/005/197/bdd0051976ce8602c6af02f2bb9d8e51.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In early October 2015, <a href="http://megamozg.ru/post/19926/">Google came under the control of the holding Alphabet</a> .  <a href="http://megamozg.ru/post/19836/">Larry Page</a> became executive director of the holding, Sergey Brin became president.  The head of Google was appointed Sundar Pichai, who had previously been the director of products: he was responsible for the Chrome browser and the Android operating system.

      In October, Sundar Pichay <a href="http://recode.net/2015/10/09/new-google-ceo-sundar-pichai-makes-first-major-executive-picks/">made the first personnel changes</a> in the company, choosing executive directors from people who are known both inside Google and outside, as veterans of their work and talented professionals.  One of the former executive directors of the company noted that "all * bad people * are left behind" (All the assholes have left). <br><br>  Of course, hardly everyone - given their inexhaustible reserves in Silicon Valley.  The new regime, which prevailed in Google, is very different from the early era of the company with its assertive leaders, including the former CEO Larry Page.  ‚ÄúHe could come off on his team.  He seemed to lack emotional intelligence.  He is just zero in this regard, ‚Äùsays a man who has worked with him for Paige.  Paige is now away from Google‚Äôs management to come to grips with research and development. <br><br>  Google is no longer a start-up who needs stubborn leaders who can go on their heads for the sake of their success and the success of the company.  Google has come to terms with its age, as is indicated by Sundar Pichai's appointments. <br><br>  A great example is Hiroshi Lockheimer, whom Sundar appointed to lead Android.  The people who worked with him do not exactly use the word ‚Äúasshole‚Äù.  Rick Osterloh, Motorola's president, says: ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs an amazing guy.  He is very cute.  He is one of those people whom you can always contact directly. "  They worked together on Good Technology in 2001. <br><br>  Lockheimer joined Google in 2006 and worked on the launch of Android 1.0.  He grew quickly thanks to the support of the head of this direction, Andy Rubin, although their style of work did not coincide in everything.  A former colleague describes Lockheimer as more balanced than Rubin and his assistants Hugo Barr, now working at Xiaomi, and Steve Horowitz, Snapchat.  In addition to Android, now Lockheimer is responsible for the Chromecast streaming service and the Chrome OS operating system. <br><br>  Lochheimer is described as an open and diplomatic leader - this is the approach to work that Pichai appreciates. <br><br>  When <a href="http://megamozg.ru/post/2608/">Motorola was owned by Google</a> , many industry players were confident that the company would now take over the dominant market position, Osterloh said.  But Lockheimer would not allow it.  ‚ÄúHe was always very careful, he had to be sure that he was playing honestly,‚Äù adds the head of Motorola. <br><br>  The appointment of Hiroshi Lockheimer is greeted by Michael Chan, CTO of the manufacturer of Nextbit Systems smartphones: ‚ÄúThis will be good for Google and for Android in particular.  Among all those who may be responsible for this work, Hiroshi is definitely the best candidate. ‚Äù <br><br>  The same qualities, according to representatives of the industry, are characteristic of Philip Shindler, who is responsible for sales in Google.  Schindler is a protege of Nikesh Arora, who was in charge of Google‚Äôs business from 2009 to 2014.  Schindler acts like Arora, but in a calmer manner.  ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs smart, sociable ‚Äî the simple guy to do business with him,‚Äù says Jonathan Nelson, head of Omnicom Digital.  One of the buyers described Schindler as a person willing to compromise in the negotiations.  Previously, Google‚Äôs advertising business was inflexible in its requirements.  Colleagues who worked with Schindler, say that he skillfully climbed the career ladder, while not stepping on anyone‚Äôs heels. <br><br>  Philip Schindler also has a lot of experience in the place where Google needs to be ‚Äúvery good‚Äù.  Schindler has worked for AOL in Europe for thirteen years, where <a href="http://megamozg.ru/post/20428/">Google now faces vigilant government control</a> . <br><br>  Affiliates should like the new, more malleable and humane Google.  But it was the former leaders, known to the inflated ego, used their energy to make Google a giant in the industry. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/295686/">https://habr.com/ru/post/295686/</a></p>
