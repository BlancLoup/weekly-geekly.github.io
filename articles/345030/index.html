Immediately, when building, they expect that, for example, the same air conditioning will require so much energy, so much maintenance work.  And then it turns out that somewhere they have laid openings so that the equipment is no longer inside.  And instead of one powerful unit, two appear, but which can be brought inside.  Or it was necessary to make a certain design for special equipment.  A foreign contractor said: <br>  - We brought the wrong design, we have already assembled it, but your equipment does not fit.  Either simple, or so take and buy more. <br><br>  And all the calculations go further forest.  It sounds crazy, but almost on every object.

      Here come in handy information models, or rather, applications to control the operation, which work in conjunction with models of buildings.  At least so that the same shopping center could easily calculate what and how much it costs to operate.  Of course, it‚Äôs not without screaming - it becomes immediately clear who, where and how much uh ... inappropriately spends. <br><br>  Naturally, BIM-applications give a lot and in the event that the building is already built and it is necessary to operate more efficiently.  Yes, it happens that there is no model (and sometimes even simple 2D documentation), but all these problems are solvable.  We are in the future, damn it, everything is thought out here! <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  A small preface about the BIM model.  This is something like a 3D-scheme of a building, on which there is, including all subsystems, nodes, and all technical and economic information.  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/croc/blog/335808/">This is where</a> my colleagues told me more about what it is and how it looks in the example of our office building.  If it is very short - at the design stage, such a thing is created, then it is used as a source for design and working documentation, and then the same model can be given directly to the BIM application for operating management.  But this is done quite rarely, because for this operation it is necessary to think in advance. <br><br><h2>  Here is what it gives (examples from real objects) </h2><br>  <b>‚óè Scheduled preventive maintenance of equipment</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/eu/1w/pp/eu1wppt8kvafty2mdqpko_u0iok.png"><br><br>  With it, all equipment units receive timely service.  Engineers are notified when and what work they need to do, what consumables to take with them. <br><br>  <b>‚óè Display of 2D floor plan, room and room card</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/nz/r0/se/nzr0sewtut6ehirpxqqjq0wargc.png"><br><br>  All information about the premises is stored in the card and is used for analytics.  This story is very important for shopping centers and office owners.  In fact, this takes into account all the costs of the room and all data on it, an inventory of equipment. <br><br>  <b>‚óè List of current unscheduled applications</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/56/fg/li/56fglitpefcaw0gwhamrxih65cq.png"><br><br>  The establishment, monitoring and closing of all applications (planned and unscheduled) is carried out within the information space.  The form of closing the work is generated automatically, and the engineer need only print it.  These are tickets (in fact, they are immediately prioritized).  For example, a burnt-out lamp in an office will have higher priority than a burnt-out lamp in a basement.  Accordingly, our customers who serve offices have the opportunity to prioritize tenants of Class A + offices, and then serve the B-category. <br><br>  <b>‚óè Equipment card</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ow/b9/wy/owb9wyczszkwg2yhj-xsurkihxg.png"><br><br>  All information about a piece of equipment is stored in a card, up to the maintenance manual, which the engineer may need.  That is, the documentation is stored in relation to the BIM-model, as well as all the data on the current situation. <br><br>  <b>‚óè Room budgeting</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rk/of/4e/rkof4e7u8gkwoslmukogm6hkahs.jpeg"><br><br>  Here you can see what and how much you need.  Very convenient for the commercial department. <br><br>  <b>‚óè Integration with the control room</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/bd/tm/cg/bdtmcgxwkoy-0esgvx1u8yxv2ka.png"><br><br>  When an accident occurs, the area where it originated is immediately localized.  If there are sensors, data from them is pulled.  Something like this in the real world: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/cn/lp/yt/cnlpytpmv_dmi_63020zkpqr2gs.png"><br><br>  About the sensors must be said separately.  All counters, all equipment telemetry (boiler room, air conditioners, drainage, lighting, movement), status of panels and electricity costs from everyone from where smoke comes and how it is distributed, control of structures - all this data is easily processed. <br><br>  Integration with BMS is generally a wonderful thing for operating organizations.  Suppose we have a BMS-system of the building, there is a control room with a bunch of light bulbs that will catch fire in case of a breakdown or accident.  What to do next is often difficult to understand, and this downtime may be critical. <br><br>  How it works: the air conditioner broke, you need to replace the filter.  In parallel with the light bulb, the BIM application starts the repair process.  The responsible engineer is sent a message: "Go to the warehouse."  A warehouse worker prints a work order and assembles a repair kit (in this case, a filter).  The engineer comes to the warehouse for everything ready and then quickly does his job. <br>  Agree, much more quickly than the classic chain in the spirit of "Ivanovich, look, here something caught fire." <br><br>  <b>Lyrical digression.</b>  If you think that this is all - the standard functions of almost every large building that you donate, then you are deeply mistaken.  Very deep.  To assess the level of prevailing razdolbaystva - a couple of examples.  Here are just recently built several rooms without doors.  Just in the real project forgot the door.  The workers did just that because the designer‚Äôs soul is dark and mysterious, and not to some foreman to tell him.  Or, on the floor, the dimensions of one block were slightly changed, and the openings instead of the standard 90 steel were 87 centimeters.  And that means plus 25% to the value of each, because it is non-standard.  What is going on in operation is generally a pain.  It all starts with the undersupply of materials, although according to the documents they come (that is, someone steals again), and ends with completely incomprehensible accounts taken from nowhere.  You start to try to trace the ends - and get lost.  Because there is no exact data, what and where it is, what was done by whom and when, when to do it next time, and so on. <br><br>  But let's go back to the BIM applications for operation. <br><br><h2>  Examples of using </h2><br>  Here are some frequent things that are asked.  The answer to everything - yes, you can: <br><br><ul><li>  For control and planning routine maintenance.  The example above.  The series of work, the distribution of work between people, reporting - everything is there.  Our engineers exploit the second office building just for this model. </li><li>  Technical staff: this is the management team.  It is important to see who does what, who is assigned to whom, who has some tolerances and accreditations (so that the employee does not drop tasks that the employee cannot do). </li><li>  To control contracts.  Registry, change history, linking to premises, notice of termination after a certain period, and so on.  Important landlords. </li><li>  Warehouse service.  What you need to store, how much, when to purchase, how to order, how to charge.  Each material is tied to its work.  Residue monitoring.  Inventory barcode scanner.  Reporting. </li><li>  Status of the premises on the plan.  List of equipment on the plan.  CAD data binding. </li><li>  Budgeting  All costs are tied to the premises, distributed by type and system ("plumbing"), can be unloaded into the overall budgeting system of the enterprise.  Convenient thing for federal companies. </li></ul><br><div class="spoiler"> <b class="spoiler_title">Here are some more pictures (this is a long spoiler with examples, neatly):</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Work diagrams by types and systems: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/w-/fr/ti/w-frtigcaa6kn1rd-lpev_s0_3c.png"><br><br>  Number of premises withdrawn from rent: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pb/3p/ps/pb3ppsqyc07-eaarslis7vnuntk.png"><br><br>  Number of insurance claims per month: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/-k/hx/gy/-khxgyczjmuvauhynsgdjyxwoi4.png"><br><br>  Delivery, return (rent, repair) of rented space: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/sr/qr/g0/srqrg0n5dvv7pvhxcprb3dorhkq.png"><br><br>  Reaction time for applications: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/x5/1d/1y/x51d1ywljujh_saaeddsmxbwivw.png"><br><br>  This is what the ‚Äúdispatch center‚Äù looks like where the key indicators are derived.  In each indicator, a ‚Äúred zone‚Äù is set up, which means that when the indicator exceeds the allowable values, the tool automatically generates a report and sends it to the responsible person by mail.  In the case when the ‚Äúred zone‚Äù is a critical indicator that requires prompt action, the tool not only informs the report, but also starts the process of correcting the situation. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/4v/dh/b6/4vdhb6mp9s8dbnyjf2dntzk-nno.png"><br><br>  Equipment - Finance: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ye/sc/ax/yescaxsa8vlcxsxws59ny2qa6du.png"><br><br>  Equipment - regulations: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rx/yt/8m/rxyt8m_zjgy1bqr9c1pclncl9ee.png"><br><br>  Equipment - event: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/dg/78/k9/dg78k92625pdtvxblac17gvsnxe.png"><br><br>  Attached documents, video: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/90/ov/qu/90ovqu3px34dikx0aamvezzjayk.png"><br><br>  Staff card - full control over the personnel of the Criminal Code: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gt/co/en/gtcoenhuk86zibry0qo0ys1kbtw.png"><br><br>  Personnel loading presentation: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fg/si/gm/fgsigmwvbwfjohl86rbi-_rtmxs.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/bm/gd/pl/bmgdpljzj0bpuzu71zdtduwvwow.png"><br><br>  CPD (calendar schedule of annual CPD, multifunction, creating a series) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fz/_u/ii/fz_uiil4kk34j7-3g_tpycmztow.png"><br><br>  MTO, warehouse. <br>  The warehouse is able to track balances and, in the case of a critically low number of consumables, automatically sends a request for approval and procurement according to a customized approval scheme and a specific procurement scheme within adjacent systems. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/_g/is/he/_gishe5slzklfvznnf25uop5fmu.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vp/fx/2r/vpfx2rx3yfxecsaqyqxy6n0kf4o.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/2e/rc/5n/2erc5nsmhuo4layme3czrpuvte4.png"><br><br>  Integration with various systems (BMS, metering devices, etc.): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/3r/0v/__/3r0v__ouihlbyzmuqjo3ifdj2nu.png"><br><br>  Treaties <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/mt/g_/mb/mtg_mbfty31qyjhxudet2wnchvk.png"><br><br></div></div><br>  All this is necessary first of all for the management - for optimization of work, economy, automation and typification of processes.  But as soon as implementation begins, it is almost always sabotage.  The cornerstone - all sorts of small things are revealed.  How much the same manager can save on light bulbs is a big question.  How much is really supplied and how much is really screwed - you can buy an apartment for the difference. <br><br>  But the analysis based on the standard 460 of the German Association GEFMA.  The methodology of this standard is based on the generally accepted modern technology for calculating the investment return on investment ROI, DPP, (M) IRR and on quantitative estimates of cost reduction based on expert data from the above association.
