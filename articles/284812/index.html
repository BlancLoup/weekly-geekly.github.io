Moreover, they did not go far and used the simplest argument, saying that the number of criminal cases decreased.  I, as a person more or less familiar with the current situation on the domestic software market, are somewhat discouraged by such a statement and this is why ... <br><br>  It all started with one of the largest "splits" on the market of large software companies - Adobe.  These citizens, or rather their Russian representation, conducted a study and found that in 2012 the number of criminal cases initiated significantly <a href="http://blogs.pcmag.ru/node/1968">decreased</a> .  This is due, according to Natalia Kalina (Director General of "UK WFP" LLC and the company's representative on copyright issues) exclusively by personnel changes in the bodies of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and changes in legislation. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      <i>‚ÄúSo, judging by the statistics of the Ministry of Internal Affairs for 2011-2012.</i>  <i>the number of crimes detected by the Ministry of Internal Affairs decreased by 33%.</i>  <i>First of all, this is due to the fact that amendments were made to the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation, which raised the threshold of citizens' liability in order to hold them accountable for illegally distributing and benefiting from actions classified as piracy.</i>  <i>Thus, in the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation, starting from December 2011, the threshold of criminal liability for the use of illegal software was raised from 50,000 rubles.</i>  <i>up to 100,000 rubles. ‚Äù</i> <br>  (PC Magazine, Igor Novikov, 13 February, 2013 - 16:25) <br><br>  Similar information was <a href="http://www.osp.ru/news/articles/2013/07/13034007/">provided by the</a> head of the department for countering intellectual piracy at Adobe Systems in the CIS, Igor Slabykh. <br><br>  In addition, the company shared information on which areas they had to work in the past year.  It turned out that the cases were divided according to the following: <br>  - installers - 56%; <br>  - sellers - 26%; <br>  - cases against end users (companies and entrepreneurs using software for work) - 16%; <br>  - cases against users who distributed illegal software via the Internet - 2%. <br><br>  That is, we see that at least Adobe‚Äôs partners (and no one else, they don‚Äôt have their own lawyers for this purpose) still work in the old manner and the bulk of their work falls to the same hawkers and students. installers.  Meanwhile, it has long been known that offline pirates have long gone out of fashion.  Every year their business becomes less profitable, and sales are falling.  If someone from Muscovites had to visit the ‚ÄúGorbushka‚Äù (now the Gorbushkin Dvor shopping center) about 5 years ago, then, having come there today, the market will not recognize: the pavilions with pirate programs, games and music that once were full of people are now practically empty.  The dots themselves still somehow hold on (although a lot has closed), but there are no buyers.  Who needs to be dragged to the market if there is Internet?  With installers, everything is simpler, but the influence of the global network is well traced in this direction: many have long realized that the same Microsoft office can be downloaded on its own, and not to cause an incomprehensible boy with a disk, which can also be laid . <br><br>  This trend can be traced throughout Russia, but is most clearly seen, of course, in Moscow.  Let us turn to the same interview with Natalia Kalina: <br><br>  <i>‚ÄúIn 2012, in Moscow and the regions, 895 criminal cases were supported on the use of unlicensed Adobe products, which accounted for 24% of the total number detected by the Ministry of the Interior in 2012.‚Äù</i> <br>  (PC Magazine, Igor Novikov, 13 February, 2013 - 16:25) <br><br>  That is, the largest city in Russia with a huge population, which is the center of IT technologies, etc., etc., etc. ... and only 24% of the total number of cases.  Why?  Everything is trivial: offline piracy is no longer relevant in Moscow.  Yes, the Savelovsky Market and Gorbushkin Dvor are not yet closed, still quite often in the summer you can find trays of pirated DVD movies, but all of this is remnants.  A pensioner can already download a movie from a tracker (good, grandchildren, so that grandfather did not bother, are happy to teach), and the average user has forgotten the way to the point ‚ÄúPrograms, music, games‚Äù for a long time.  Meanwhile, this situation is becoming more and more relevant with the regions.  Things are easy - the development of communications.  It is clear that Internet access is cheaper and faster in Moscow and St. Petersburg, but as <a href="http://www.cnews.ru/top/2012/03/29/ceny_na_internet_v_rossii_ruhnuli_a_skorost_vzletela_cifry_483438">it turns out</a> , the situation is constantly being improved for the better: <br><br>  <i>in 2010, the average cost of access to the Network decreased by almost 43%, they say in Yandex.</i>  <i>Such a rapid decline in prices on the Internet in recent years, the company attributed to increased competition.</i>  <i>‚ÄúA year or two ago, in a city with a population of 100 to 250 thousand people, there were an average of 2‚Äì4 providers, and today there are already 7‚Äì8,‚Äù says Ekaterina Karnaukhova, a Yandex representative.</i>  <i>‚ÄúIn addition, large players come to Russian cities who find it easier than small providers to keep prices low.‚Äù</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Amid falling Internet prices, the average speed of Internet access is growing: over the year it increased by 50% in Moscow and St. Petersburg (up to 16.5 Mbit / s) and by 156% in regions (up to 6.4 Mbit / s) .</i>  <i>The fastest Internet is in St. Petersburg, where its most common speed is 17 Mbit / s.</i>  <i>In the Far East, the situation with the speed of access to the Internet, as well as with the prices, is the worst of all - the most common speed there is only 1 Mbit / s.</i> <br>  (CNEWS, 03/29/12, Thu, 11:00, Moscow time, Natalya Lavrentieva) <br><br>  And with all this, Adobe continues to report on trapping installers!  Are you guys talking about anything at all?  What world do you live in?  It seems that the Russian representation simply reprimanded for the fact that it gave incorrect data (they say, ‚Äúwe are fighting with piracy, everything is ok‚Äù), so it decided to somehow justify it.  Meanwhile, for example, NPPP, despite its enchanting nature, gave much more adequate <a href="http://www.pcweek.ru/business/blog/business/4473.php">statistics</a> : yes, the number of recorded crimes decreased, but not because everything is so bad, but because the piracy rate is falling: ‚Äúthe share of licensed software products in Russia over the past nine years, it has increased 2.8 times (from 13 to 37%), and the level of computer piracy has become equal to the level of the countries of Central and Eastern Europe. ‚Äù <br><br>  And, again, let's not forget about the Internet.  In general, the global network is a unique market that can actually be used quite effectively.  And you can just turn away from him and get the notorious 2 adobe percent.  Of course, there are many pirated resources on the Internet.  Probably not even just a lot, but a lot, but you can fight them.  Just to do this, you need to apply much more power than on a raid with police officers on some provincial market.  And you need a head on your shoulders, otherwise it will be like with <b>The Pirate Bay</b> , which everyone wants to close, but they can‚Äôt do it, although it seems that there can be simpler: the court decision also has legislation on your side.  No, it is much easier to work with foreign forces.  Although, as you know, those who need it will always achieve their goal, like, for example, the owners of the <b>Smeshariki</b> brand, who have already won quite a few different cases, including on the Internet. <br><br>  But there are non-judicial methods!  Even the notorious Vkontakte removes copyright infringing materials upon request, but you need to look for these materials in it, and many copyright holders do not want to do this: they either want it to disappear all at once, or so closed site itself.  Here and the next <a href="http://spb.ria.ru/trend/pirated_content_13082012/">claims</a> , a problem not solving are born.  But "dough cut down"!  Many rightholders are guided by the same logic when they say that law enforcement agencies themselves should initiate criminal proceedings under art.  146 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (i.e., without a statement from the victim). <br><br>  Meanwhile, all those who are ‚Äúin the subject line‚Äù have long been understood: to combat piracy, there are few horrible faces that threaten to plant everyone who even thinks about infringing copyrights.  Other actions are needed.  Among other things, and pricing.  Only the lazy did not participate in the debate about the overpriced Windows.  But this is only an isolated case.  Many rightholders simply do not understand that in Russia software needs completely different prices, and the European version does not suit us.  In the distant 90s, game publishers were able to achieve the ability to publish so-called ‚Äújewel‚Äù editions, not so long ago Steam introduced separate prices and payment systems in the Russian region, but many right holders still continue to live in a vacuum.  Guess how much is the recently released remake of SimCity?  1200 rubles!  Yes, you heard right.  That's exactly what the Electronic Arts guys want to play.  Well, their lips are not stupid.  Only <b>SimCity</b> is not Starcraft 2, which means that very soon EA will complain about the terrible Russian pirates who prevent them from living and the police, who do not catch criminals themselves. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/284812/">https://habr.com/ru/post/284812/</a></p>
