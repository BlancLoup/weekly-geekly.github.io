As an example: <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/arbeit/94674/">"Our memory is everything</a> . <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/arbeit/94674/">"</a>  This article describes in some detail the form of structuring memory in the form of entries in notebooks.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h2>  1.Blocks </h2><br>  The title contains a link to the article, which describes in great detail how to use notebooks for memorization.  Therefore, I will not describe this process in detail.  I will dwell only on the pros and cons of notebooks. <br><img src="http://habreffect.ru/files/476/712e55eee/1176286803.jpg" align="right"><br>  Pros: <br><ul><li>  Traditional input; </li><li>  Always at hand; </li><li>  Visibility; </li><li>  The speed of use. </li></ul><br>  Minuses: <br><ul><li>  The difficulty of searching for a large volume of records; </li><li>  Likely damage. </li></ul><br><br>  All the advantages are clear enough, so I will explain only the disadvantages. <br><br>  I use about 3-4 notebooks per month.  Notebooks are different, there are usually parallel to 2, end at different times, and therefore the degree of synchronization is very low.  Actually, there are no problems at the moments of reference, but when it is necessary to find something over the past month, then the problems begin ... <br><br>  On the second point.  Several times dropped a notebook in a puddle when I tried to write on the street.  There is even a question of relationship.  A notebook is just a stack of paper, which is why safety is often neglected. <br><br><h2>  2. Portable devices. </h2><br>  In this section, we consider the possibilities for memorizing such devices as smartphones and PDAs. <br><br>  I will tell from personal experience, who has a different experience, write in the comments.  Having read article on Habr√© (could not find it habrapoisk) about usability of electronic memos, I decided to try.  As a platform used Nokia E63.  This smartphone has a fairly convenient Active Notes system built in and there is a QWERTY keyboard, which greatly simplifies input. <br><br>  In Active Notes, there is the ability to create folders and the ability to sort records by date and title, which greatly simplifies the search.  However, the question remains the lack of search.  Since the accumulation of a large amount of records search for them remains a problem. <br><br>  The question of entering drawings into notes was also acute, and in general the input speed is often not enough.  In order to make a mark you have to enter it entirely, such an action is tantamount to a simple stroke in a notebook.  Since the recordings need to be done fairly quickly, after some time of use, a large number of unfixed notes are obtained.  Which is difficult to catalog <br><img src="http://habreffect.ru/files/0bc/f975f0829/nokia-e63-business-smartphone.jpg" align="left"><br>  Active Notes. <br><br>  Pros: <br><ul><li>  High level of synchronization of records; </li><li>  Always at hand; </li><li>  Cataloging capabilities; </li><li>  Small size. </li></ul><br>  Minuses: <br><ul><li>  The difficulty of searching for a large volume of records; </li><li>  Reduced input speed compared to notebooks; </li><li>  The problem of sketching pictures. </li></ul><br><br><br><h2>  3.Online notepads </h2><br><br>  Having learned from Habr about the <a href="http://www.evernote.com/">Evernote</a> service, I decided to try using it, but I didn‚Äôt take it.  Again, the computer is not always at hand, and the price of mobile traffic leaves much to be desired.  But I liked the concept of the repository of interesting links. <br><br>  I have Google Chrome installed at home with the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/jbikhmelidedkckpokhanhejpkjfboih">Google Task</a> extension.  It is in the Google Task that I drop various interesting links, such as those that I looked through, and those that I couldn‚Äôt see due to lack of time.  This provides a high level of synchronization and is much more convenient than simply sending links to your email.  It is often difficult to find the necessary link in the stream of letters, and here click on the extension and all the links in the palm of your hand.  Of course, such use of Google Task is not quite as intended and is relevant for those who do not use this google service for its intended purpose. <br><br>  In this section, I will not make a block with pluses and minuses, because I didn‚Äôt use the online notebook much.  And the main advantages and use of Google Task are described above. <br><br><h2>  4. Symbiosis </h2><br><img src="http://habreffect.ru/files/840/620754cc8/OneNoteLogo.png" align="right"><br>  By trial and error, I found that I could not refuse traditional notebooks.  Hope I'm not the only one so conservative.  Then I found a way to combine the usual input method, convenient search and cataloging. <br><br>  While surfing the Internet, I came across the description of <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/ru-ru/training/CR010565801049.aspx">Microsoft Office: OneNote</a> (via the link lessons).  I have seen OneNote several times before.  I just came in from the interest of what is in Microsoft Office and what I do not use. <br><br>  Inspired by the review, OneNote decided to start using it.  Next, I will talk about my new recording system and OneNote experience. <br><br><h3>  How OneNote + Notepad Works </h3><br>  I still use a few notebooks for writing on a daily basis, I also make sketches and short notes.  The difference from the first option is that at the end of the day I bring everything to OneNote, and at home I work directly at OneNote.  This is how the <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2594%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B3%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0_%25D1%2581%25D0%25B2%25D1%258F%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B9">Mind Map of</a> this article in the OneNote <a href="">link</a> looks like. <br><br>  Using OneNote, I was able to catalog my records, provide them with a high enough level of synchronization and make it easier to search through the old records.  Yes, for the convenience we have to pay.  Here the board goes by the time it takes to transfer information from a notebook to OneNote.  In the bottom line of this symbiosis, I received: <br><br>  Pros: <br><ul><li>  High level of synchronization of records; </li><li>  Always at hand; </li><li>  Cataloging capabilities; </li><li>  Convenience search. </li></ul><br>  Minuses: <br><ul><li>  Time to transfer records; </li><li>  I did not find an automatic way to synchronize the book, without copying files; </li></ul><br><br>  It is worth noting that OneNote is included in the <a href="http://www.officelive.com/">Office Live</a> project.  It is quite possible that in the near future access to the functionality of this application will be available through a ‚Äúthin‚Äù client, which will completely solve synchronization problems. <br><br>  I hope this article will help someone to fix and not lose their interesting ideas and developments. <br><br>  PS: The title was probably not chosen very well, since the conversation was about structuring ideas presented in one form or another.  An almost familiar mechanism works here, we have an internal memory and an external one (I told you about it), if searching by the first is the task of long trainings, then searching by the second is decided only by choosing the right tools. <br><br>  Thanks for attention. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/95538/">https://habr.com/ru/post/95538/</a></p>
