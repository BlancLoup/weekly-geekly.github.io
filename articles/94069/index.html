  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Yandex. Direct. Tutorial novice advertiser. Increasing CTR ads</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  However, the general term ‚Äúincrease in CTR‚Äù is not entirely accurate, in this case it is appropriate to talk about increasing the click-through rate for each specific key request.  On the <a href="http://help.yandex.ru/direct/">‚ÄúHelp‚Äù</a> page of Yandex Direct, sensible advice is given on this subject (in the official language), but we will expand the boundaries of knowledge and dwell more (on less official) on key points. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  So, as you know, CTR is the ratio of clicks to impressions in percentage terms.  It is considered that the higher the CTR, the higher the effectiveness of the ad.  Of course, if the ad is made correctly (not from yours, but from the point of view of the buyer), and the conversion is high.  But a high CTR sometimes a priori does not mean a good conversion, but rather the opposite. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      For example, the purchase of the request ‚Äúdownload mp3‚Äù will give a monstrously high CTR and low conversion.  It‚Äôs not a fact that all seekers will buy music from you, because  the user is free to attach to the request the name of your favorite group, and all your money will go into the sand.  For the same reason, the more focused to reasonable, or rather, to the necessary limits of the announcement, the higher the CTR and conversion, so to speak in the kit. <br><br>  So, the main tips for improving the CTR are based only on logic and common sense, without pretentious statements "brand", "recognition", "grab attention" and other Labuda. <br><br>  1. The ad title should contain the desired user request, preferably taking into account the morphology.  For example, on request "thermonuclear warheads" you are required to display the heading "Thermonuclear warheads - delivery to your city" <br><br>  2. In the ad text, it is necessary to reflect the exact requests of users, (it is possible two times in different declinations), plus the most frequent word from the right column ‚Äúwhat else people were looking for‚Äù. <br><br>  3. Turn on the logic, use the search for Yandex.Direct operators (hereinafter define yourself).  Requests "warhead" and "! Warheads" may have a completely different CTR.  Tip: look at your products and think about how customers are looking for them. <br><br>  4. Cut off trash at the entrance.  Minus the stop words until you lose consciousness.  Approach this issue with special care.  At the finish line with very tough competition, one extra stop-word in Yandex Direct can take you to the leaders, and send a competitor to the forefathers. <br><br>  Make a list of standard stop words of your subject (-forum-abstract-download-course-review-article-market-research-business-reviews -the directory -bla -bla -bla) and in the base put them in the direct to each purchased keyword. <br><br>  In addition, do not forget about the fantasy of users - this is an unusually developed thing.  Therefore, try to cope with your ego, abstract from your favorite business and start ‚Äúthinking like a user‚Äù.  And then you will definitely find more stop words that are not in the form of word selection. <br><br>  5. Take as a rule: "One ad - one keyword."  This way you insure your advertising campaign against possible mistakes - do not burn bridges behind you.  Following this rule, you can always understand where you made a mistake and intervene operatively in the course of an advertising campaign. <br><br>  6. Do not neglect geo-targeting, it is an excellent tool in capable hands.  Do not be lazy, form regional campaigns. <br><br>  There is no need to show an advertisement for the sale of elite puppies in Moscow to a user from Krasnoyarsk.  This way you generate extra impressions that lead to a decrease in the effectiveness of the ad as a whole and, ultimately, to an increase in your bids. <br><br>  In addition, the breakdown of ads by region gives you freedom of action and mobility on the battlefield.  Suppose you work all over Russia.  Very good.  By showing an ad to the whole country, you are depriving yourself of the opportunity to quickly see the current rates and statistics on transitions from each specific region - you will have to sit for hours in the statistics interface and isolate cities.  Or keep a whole analytical department of idlers who will eat away all the profits of the office. <br><br>  It is possible that your product is in demand only in certain cities.  In the case of a wide geo-targeting, vague doubts will constantly torment you, and you will never know ‚Äúwhere the big fish is swimming,‚Äù because the cliques will spread across the whole immense country. <br><br>  The conclusion suggests itself.  Everything is trivial: split the ads into separate regions and get a 100% managed advertising campaign in each of them. <br><br>  7. Turn off your campaigns at night or launch copies of your main campaigns at lower rates.  Note that in some subjects the nightly activity of buyers is much higher in the daytime. <br><br>  8. Work and on weekends.  Advice for raising the CTR or, more precisely, advice for those who are aimed at the title of "King of the Hill" (entrance to the Special Placement).  It is on weekends that competitors drink beer at the moment when you set up a trap with impunity and calm, which will break the entire advertising campaign. <br><br>  9. Write the headlines in simple, understandable, human language.  Keep it simple.  Send to hell with a stupid creative.  People are not as smart as you think.  Do not use complex terminology in the texts - as soon as a person reads something complicated and does not understand what it is about, the most dense complexes wake up immediately.  Imagine that a client is sitting in front of you and you need in a couple of minutes in simple language to submit and sell your goods. <br><br>  10. Stop saying about "low prices."  You can specify the price, but note that competitors can do the same (any fool can lower the price).  If you, of course, not the sole leader in the market.  Otherwise, when attacking small competitors from all sides, it is possible and necessary to dump until the opponents start flying out of Direct, like corks from a champagne bottle. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/94069/">https://habr.com/ru/post/94069/</a></p>
