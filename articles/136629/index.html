      The history of the game "Snake" began a few years before the first mobile phones.  In 1977, the company Gremlin Industries released a <a href="http://www.arcade-history.com/%3Fn%3Dhustle%26page%3Ddetail%26id%3D1156">gaming machine Hustle</a> , designed for one or two players, in which it was necessary to manage the "snakes", directing them to unsystematically appearing goals.  To win, you had to get more points than your opponent, blocking his way to new goals (in the case of a multiplayer game) as the game progressed, or just beat the record set on the slot machine.  In 1984, Gremlin Industries was forced to close, but the game Hustle began to gain momentum: first there was a port for computers TRS-80, then for Commodore PET and Apple II. <br><br>  Nokia‚Äôs original Snake ( <b>Snake</b> ) appeared in 1997 thanks to the efforts of developer Taneli Ormanto.  In the same year, the company released the first phone with this game, the Nokia 6110. Even then, the game was multiplayer: the phones communicated via infrared ports, because neither Bluetooth, nor Wi-Fi in phones at that time was available.  The snake itself consisted of black squares and could move in four directions.  The game zone, on which the reptile moved, was limited by the size of the phone's screen: when the snake's head hit the edge of the phone, the game ended.  "Snake" gained incredible popularity, comparable only to the popularity of modern hits "Angry Birds" and "Cut the Rope". <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ed0/2a2/ed9/ed02a2ed9d225c98cd1c23f7da71a032.jpg" align="right">  The second part of "Snake" - " <b>Snake II</b> " - acquired a "seamless" play area, so the snake did not "die", cutting into the edge of the screen, but crawled out from the opposite part of the display.  Obstacle maps were also added that couldn‚Äôt be crashed into.  In the new version was a cheat: if you have time to pause the game at the time of the absorption of food by the snake, it did not increase in size.  With the help of this trick, diligent, but not very honest gamers earned a magnificent account to boast to their friends.  In the end, not completely honest way, people earned 20 and 30 thousand points - despite the fact that in the first ‚ÄúSnake‚Äù it was impossible to score more than 4,500 points. <br><br>  Subsequently, Nokia released the <b>Snake Xenzia</b> game for monochrome and budget color phones, <b>Snake EX</b> and <b>Snake EX2</b> with improved graphics and multiplayer via Bluetooth for color phones on S60 and S40. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/00f/204/190/00f204190bd07b33e32ae968994c8c1f.jpg" align="left">  In January 2005, specifically for N-Gage, IOMO (which is the largest developer of mobile games in Europe at that time) commissioned Nokia to develop a new, sixth, version of the game - Snake, or <b>Snakes</b> .  This time the game was already three-dimensional, and the graphics corresponded to the level of Sony PlayStation.  In ‚ÄúSnakes‚Äù, there was multiplayer via Bluetooth for 4 people, a ‚Äúviral‚Äù quick transfer of the game to N-Gage friends was realized.  Subsequently, the game "Snakes" became available for all smartphones on the S60, but without the multiplayer. <br><br>  The next version of the game was the three-dimensional " <b>Snake III</b> ".  She repeated the game ‚ÄúSnakes‚Äù and differed only in the realistic graphics - after all, in ‚ÄúSnakes‚Äù the snakes were rather abstract.  The rest of the game contained the same game modes and the same multiplayer via Bluetooth. <br><br>  Finally, in 2008, the latest version of Snake, <b>Snakes Subsonic</b> , was released.  Sabsonik was a continuation of the Snakes game, but for the N-Gage gaming service, available on two dozen Nokia devices. <br><br>  After the release of ‚ÄúSnakes Subsonic‚Äù, the legendary ‚ÄúSnake‚Äù did not develop any more - the era of push-button telephones passed, and the game did not quite fit for touch-sensitive mobile devices.  Nevertheless, the Snake continues to play now. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7af/601/87a/7af60187a73f867d060fae96f780ec95.jpg"><br><br>  If you don‚Äôt have a Nokia phone with a game installed, you can postpone it by launching Snake on the <a href="http://conversations.nokia.com/2011/12/13/nokia-snake-game-play-it-here/">Nokia Conversations</a> blog of our global colleagues.  In addition, "Snake" is available in the interface of Gmail and YouTube - apparently, in Google someone really liked this game.  To launch Snake in Gmail, you need to go to the settings and add the Old Snakey function in the Labs tab, then press the "&amp;" key in the main window of the mail service, and to launch the game on YouTube in any video you like, press the left and up keys simultaneously. <br><br>  Well, of course, one cannot help asking, but what was your maximum score in Snake?  ;) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/136629/">https://habr.com/ru/post/136629/</a></p>
