It is necessary to have very good reasons (a specific goal) in order to spend such a huge chunk of time for an unknown result.  In addition, the principle of 50-50 (theory-practice) is not applicable when studying, everything is exactly the opposite, which (in my opinion) indicates the disadvantage of current teaching methods. <br><br><h3>  1. The need for time (reasons) </h3><br><a name="habracut"></a>  Definition: Effective Time Management? <br>  We will understand by ‚ÄúEffective Time Management‚Äù the way in which the following condition is fulfilled in your life. <br>  1. You are satisfied with the results (progress towards the goal); <br>  2. You are completely free from urgent and uninteresting affairs. <br>  The ideal is unattainable, but the more satisfied and more free you are, the better the time management. <br>  <b>Corollary:</b> If you do not have a goal, you do not need time. <br>  USE TIME MANAGEMENT WITHOUT AIM - PROHIBITED <br>  <b>Advice:</b> Do not reproach yourself for inaction!  It is often better to do nothing than to do something wrong.

      How to develop a goal? <br>  No matter how fate turns, the only goal that deserves you is to change the world.  All other goals are either selfish (then you just have not yet understood yourself and YOU EARLY TO THINK ABOUT THE PURPOSE), or come down to ‚Äúchange the world‚Äù. <br>  <b>Corollary:</b> YOUR GOAL is formulated as follows: I decided (for the period of my life / there is no other /) to change the world so that it has more (listing of favorite things and feelings, but not things) / things are the main enemies of time /. <br><br><h3>  2. Acceptance of time (axioms) </h3><br>  The phrase "time is money" is not very true.  Time is more versatile than money. <br>  Time is all that is given to us in this life.  Time and life are almost synonymous. <br>  Time - you can invest.  Nothing else can be invested without time.  (see * investment) <br>  A person needed and needs a universal currency to evaluate the path that he chooses every second.  Historically, this is money.  But time is a natural and much more universal measure.  (see * accounting in time).  Therefore, it is more natural to build a business on temporary resources, and not on monetary ones.  (see * business and time). <br><br><h3>  3. Existence over time (concepts) </h3><br>  Do only favorite things.  If you cannot afford it, this text is not for you. <br>  Rationale: <br>  1. You can‚Äôt do anything well if you don‚Äôt like it <br>  2. The ability to do uninteresting things leads to a dilemma of choice, which, in my opinion, cannot be objectively solved. <br>  <b>Tip:</b> DOING NON-INTERESTING CASES IS FORBIDDEN <br><br>  HOW TO CHOOSE THE REQUIRED BUSINESS <br>  1. Necessary affairs are interesting. <br>  2. Doing things you don‚Äôt need to do <br>  3. The right things work for the future. <br>  (ATTENTION: ANY OTHER CASES ARE FORCED AND UNNECESSARY) <br><br>  / Turning to the highest level of time management / <br>  Throw away the HOURS AND DAILY - THEY DON'T NEED YOU <br>  Rationale: <br>  1. A person has a memory and a sense of time.  Both of these abilities are unique and absolutely necessary.  Therefore, getting rid of the HOURS and DAILY, YOU WILL TRAIN MEMORY <br>  2. Throwing hours, remember, time is your property, it belongs to you, not you to him. <br>  The advice is not for beginners! <br>  If you did not have a watch and a diary, YOU first need to BUY both, to understand why they are needed.  And only then - throw it away.  I think it is ineffective to avoid things that I am not familiar with. <br><br>  Do not try to convince people.  Their beliefs are their personal happiness. <br>  What to do?  Give them your own opinion, agree with those points that you recognize and disagree with those that you do not recognize.  End the conversation.  Be absolutely open and honest.  In this case, your interlocutors will not have questions. <br><br>  Love people and yourself first <br>  1. Love to others will allow you to love yourself and not fall into egoism.  Also protects against conflicts.  No one can take and give you as much time as other people. <br>  2. Self-love will allow you to save your time from abuse. <br>  Corollary: Be honest with yourself and others. <br><br><h3>  4. Production time (basic techniques) </h3><br>  STRUCTURED TIME <br><br>  A. EVERYTHING CANNOT BE DELAYED - GET RIDDLE OF WINE SENSES <br>  You will not be able to overcome time if you consider that you owe it to him. <br>  Reporting to someone to use their time is harmful.  After all, time is what is really yours.  That someone can demand from you only a specific result.  But if your work is somewhere on the spot and receive customer calls, then missed calls are the negative result for which you can easily be answered. <br><br>  B. CONNECT TO AUTOMATISM WHAT YOU CAN BETTER TO AUTOMATION This will allow you and your mind not to notice these matters. <br><br>  C. ONLY ONE ONE BUSINESS AT EVERY MOMENT ... <br>  + LIMIT NUMBER OF HANGING RINGS (remove things) <br>  + MAKE "GOAL" (remember why) <br>  + TRUST YOUR INTUITION.  She knows more than you (mind-sensation balance) <br><br>  <b>Corollary 1: The</b> ideal desktop is empty;  The ideal mailbox is empty; <br>  <b>Corollary 2:</b> Hanging important matters are especially dangerous.  The case takes about 10% of its importance.  Throw in 10 important things and you will not be able to work at all. <br>  <b>Corollary 3: It is</b> much easier and more effective to tell a person that you will be involved in this matter after the time has passed and he (interested) REMINDS YOU OF THIS.  In this case, your brain is resting and enjoying life.  It is better to remember something useful than those things that are not necessary to remember.  By the way, confirmed by the concept of pleasant things.  He will be pleased to remind you, but you usually are not pleased to remember this yourself. <br>  <b>Corollary 4:</b> Create completeness (each completed case is dissolved in space and does not bother). <br>  <b>Corollary 5:</b> Do not mix several cases together.  Cases - they are good separately.  The phrase: ‚ÄúI will do your business after I do another thing‚Äù - must leave your vocabulary.  You don‚Äôt know if it will ever be completed again, and this is certainly not the case. <br><br>  D. HURRY SLOWLY.  Since any time trouble is ineffective. <br>  ALWAYS KEEP 33% TIME FREE (THEN 50%) <br>  Rationale: It is impossible to structure the time when it is all taken.  You need room to maneuver. <br><br><h3>  5. Saving time (caution) </h3><br>  Get rid of things.  Things take time.  There are undoubtedly useful things, but they are useful and harmful at the same time.  Feel the balance when things become harmful - get rid of them. <br>  In addition, it will be interesting to know that 90% of things are useless in nature. <br>  My observations: A car taken with itself takes away from me time for 5 grams per day, brings a gain in time depending on the circumstances from --20 (traffic jams) to +40 (carriage of vehicles, out-of-town trips). <br>  Mobile phone takes 1 gr.  and brings time to 4 grams. <br>  Palm takes time to 4 grams and brings only 1 grams, I do not wear Palm.  The amounts are relative, moreover, they somehow stole it from me, which also led to some temporary losses (for useless unrest and for restoration of information, change of passwords) <br><br>  <b>The investigation.</b>  If you love your time you should avoid: <br>  1. Reading thick books (especially unloved).  In any case, the books should be avidly read / perform a favorite thing / or not read at all. <br>  2. Long negotiations with a large number of people.  / It is clear that half of those present simply lose their time. <br><br>  <b>Council</b>  Be able to stop and go back, do not try to be right. <br>  1. I have noticed a prejudice against many people and myself against walking 5 meters in the opposite direction, admitting my mistakes and so on.  Get rid of this, any prejudice can be forgotten. <br>  2. Learn to admit your mistakes.  Then what you have done will save your time, and not spend it. <br><br>  E. DON'T TAKE INTO LONG DEALS (love simplicity), QUICKLY (--Love time--) GET OUT OF UNFINISHABLE ACTIVITIES (--Love yourself--) AND WITH THIS KEEP YOUR WORD (--Love people--) <br><br>  <b>Corollary 1:</b> Do not throw your word around. <br>  <b>Corollary 2:</b> Do not deal with complex matters - either simplify or forget. <br><br>  F. DON'T WORK WITH THOSE WHO WORKS WORSE YOU.  Nothing takes as much time as inconsistencies with careless assistants. <br><br>  <b>Consequence:</b> People need to pay high salaries, because the specialists of your level are worth a lot. <br><br>  G. CASES NEEDED <br><br>  1. Forget <br>  (if you can not forget) <br>  2. Make right and right <br>  (if you can not do or uninteresting) <br>  3. Give to do another <br><br>  <b>Consequences:</b> <br>  1. Forgetting is the most effective method.  It needs a habit, but most cases are absolutely useless. <br>  2. Remember each ‚Äúdone‚Äù case also takes time (for support, for consultation for expressing feelings of gratitude).  / note - sincere positive emotions of other people, meanwhile, save time. <br>  3. Having done the other, scroll to MANY TIMES ON CONTROL, but leave it (time) in stock. <br><br>  <b>Post Effect:</b> VERY IMPORTANT.  DO THE MATTERS CORRECTLY (correctly - this is so that as a result you get a gain in time, not a loss), an incorrectly done business takes 10-20 times more time afterwards.  DOING THE MATTER WRONG - FORBIDDEN <br><br>  <b>PostPosText:</b> <br>  CORRECTLY (with the saving of time) the deeds done strengthen YOUR FAITH IN THE AUTHORITIES OVER TIME.  It is very useful. <br><br>  <b>Tip:</b> Leave some time for correctness control. <br><br>  Especially harmful things: self-admiration, selfishness, prejudice, offended at and offend people, luxury, euphoria. <br><br>  Your image should generate time, not devour it.  Watch this. <br>  If you have a euphoria - it means YOU DO SOMETHING TOO QUICKLY, slow down.  Keep a balance between mind and senses.  Do not let either one gain the upper hand. <br><br><h3>  6. Implementation (methods) </h3><br>  Notes: <br>  1. Do not try to force events unnecessarily, nothing happens right away (it is better to climb the steps than to climb a bare wall). <br>  2. Philosophy must be realized as a whole and introduced slowly and evenly (a cart on two wheels / beliefs / if it goes, it is crooked) <br>  3. Do not be afraid to experiment (there is no other true experience besides your own) <br>  4. Where you need time, not art - stick to consistent technology (don't argue yourself) <br>  5. DON'T RELEASE THE RESULTS <br><br><h3>  Applications (redundant) </h3><br>  * Time is more natural than money. <br>  Why is time a more natural measure of success than money? <br>  Initially, at birth, you are given only time.  And the goal of your life (at the physical level), can be only one single thing - to effectively use the time measured by you.  By efficiency, you can understand what you want. <br><br>  * Negative coloring of money <br>  Money is a kind of ‚Äúfictitious‚Äù thing that was invented and not existed originally.  Time is an entity given to us.  There is nothing wrong with money, but also, like every ‚Äúfictitious‚Äù (unnatural) thing, money has its limitations.  And people who see these restrictions, face them will condemn those who have chosen the measure of money.  It would be inappropriate to write these people into enemies.  Choose another landmark - time. <br><br>  * Recalculation of money during <br><br>  Will you have 1000 dollars for a couple of days?  So this amount can save for you this time.  You can hire a housewife and this will also save you time.  Unfortunately, money does not exist by itself.  If you plan to not only spend, but also effectively use them (invest) - they already not only give, but also take time away from you. <br><br>  * Time accounting <br>  The main advantages of accounting in time: <br>  1. As income grows, money loses its value, and time remains unchanged. <br>  2. Time is more natural than money (see * time is more natural than money) <br>  3. Money is negative (see * negative coloring of money), and there is no time <br><br>  *Investments <br>  Money can only be invested with time.  You can really be busy with business if your grandfather bequeaths you several billion.  It will take time for you to select consultants (at a minimum) if you really want to invest this money.  Knowledge is almost impossible to invest, they are not amenable to accounting and evaluation.  You can invest decades in knowledge, but if you don‚Äôt spend years using them, knowledge will die with you. <br><br>  * Business and time <br>  No matter how much you pay your employees, all they can do is generate or devour time.  Therefore, it is the time balance that distinguishes a successful firm from an unsuccessful one.  A successful company produces a lot of effective time, and an unsuccessful one devours it (as a result, together with money).  ) <br><br>  Authorship is mine, Alex Mas </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/41421/">https://habr.com/ru/post/41421/</a></p>
