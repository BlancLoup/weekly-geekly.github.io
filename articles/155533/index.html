And last week, Rustam suddenly announced to me that it turns out they conducted an experiment with this system and can tell you what came of it. <br><br>  Yesterday I got into the car and went to Shaymuratovo to talk with Arthur to find out the details. <br><a name="habracut"></a>

    <h4>  A couple of important points </h4><br><ol><li>  In order to better understand the essence of the experiment, a respected reader is invited to familiarize himself with the previous article <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/146815/">"The system of motivation with elements of market relations</a> . <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/146815/">"</a> </li><li>  The state farm used the policy of distribution of bonus funds, which in the previous article was called ‚ÄúAnarchy‚Äù, i.e.  all employees had the same bonus fund. </li></ol><br><br><h4>  Small retreat </h4><br>  So, the experiment was conducted during June and July.  It was originally planned to introduce it on the farm.  However, this turned out to be difficult.  The farm worker has his own work plot and does not understand well what his colleague does.  So, can not adequately evaluate his work.  Therefore, it was decided to apply this system when harvesting hay pits. <br><br>  A haypit is a special pit in which livestock feed is harvested for the winter.  First, a large pit is pulled out, then it is filled with shredded feed, rammed with a tractor and covered with a special film.  Then digs in. <br><br>  The hayhole is extremely sensitive to the quality of the coating film and time.  Ideally, the film is stretched immediately after the tractor has passed and all the work is done in half a day.  If the work is stretched for a day, then the quality of the feed drops sharply, as rotting processes start. <br>  Hay pits are made by small teams of handymen from 5 to 9 people depending on the volume of hay.  Actually in these teams and the system was introduced. <br><br><h4>  The experiment formalism </h4><br><ol><li>  Before the manufacture of each hayfield, the total wage fund of employees is calculated depending on the volume of harvested feed.  That is, if the pit is large, then the total payment fund is large. </li><li>  At the end of the work, the manager checks the quality of the production of the hay box on a 5-point scale.  At the same time, the bonus fund changes in direct proportion to the assessment.  If the pit is made on 5k, then the fund is 100%.  If 4ku, then 80% of the original amount.  The resulting common pie has already been shared among the workers. </li><li>  Then a special form is issued to the team involved in the work on a specific pit. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/258/72d/9b9/25872d9b96dba11f0f68399c636046d7.png"><br>  In this form, the manager fills in the name of the work, the size of the bonus fund of each employee, the size of the final pie.  Employees also fill out a prize to whom. <br></li><li>  Next, the forms are submitted to the accounting department and are reduced to a single table by an economist.  The table is posted on public display next to the accounting department.  Unfortunately, I can‚Äôt show the original table, because by my arrival it had already been removed from the board, so I only show printouts of ‚Äúraw‚Äù tables. <br></li><li>  At the end of the month, in this large summary table you can see who earned how much and what is actually paid. </li></ol><br>  That's all.  Now we come to the most interesting. <br><br><h4>  The course of the experiment </h4><br><h5>  Pit number 1 </h5><br>  The fact is that earlier the hourly wage scheme was used, i.e.  the laborer was given the task of making a hayfield and they began to work.  Payment was made upon the time worked.  Now, the workers were put in front of a specific amount of work and a specific payment and gave them a tool to calculate their own share. <br>  Such workers have never seen and have secretly distributed awards equally.  At the same time, the quality and speed of the manufactured pit was not very high.  Arthur estimated the quality of the first two pits independently and deliberately set 5ku in front of the first pit despite the low quality.  This was done in order not to demotivate workers.  Blanks were brought down and posted on the wall in the accounting department. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/65b/201/e29/65b201e29f940e717ecb908010971e17.png"><br><br><h5>  Pit number 2 </h5><br>  Soon it was time to make the second pit, and each worker slept with the thought of a new approach.  The results of the distribution of points have changed and in the team two employees stood out who were rewarded with slightly less than average and one who were rewarded with slightly more than average.  At the same time, the pit was made significantly faster and with better quality. <br>  Arthur rated the quality of the pit at 4 points.  It should be noted that a tacit coalition was formed against two employees who were rewarded the least.  These employees refused to participate in the production of hay pits and were transferred to others. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/cd0/a82/504/cd0a825047584213a15ae83ea4a5938f.png"><br><br><h5>  The following pits </h5><br>  Subsequent pits were made with pretty good quality and during noon.  At the same time, the spread of premiums increased even more, i.e.  employees are no longer ashamed to ‚Äúhonestly‚Äù evaluate each other‚Äôs work. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/37d/0c1/fb9/37d0c1fb9f49ff1dd50acc7bd6d627cb.png"><br>  The system is in equilibrium. <br><br><h4>  Economic results </h4><br><ol><li>  The speed of making the pit approached the ideal.  Each pit was prepared by the team for half a day. </li><li>  The quality of the manufacture of holes has increased significantly, which means that the feed will deteriorate in the fall and winter </li></ol><br>  Well, as a result, the knives provide good food for the winter :-) <br><br><h4>  Brief summary </h4><br><h5>  Arthur Nurgaliev </h5><br><ol><li>  The scheme works well in teams of three people who can evaluate the work of each other. </li><li>  It is planned to introduce this system in Shaymuratovo not only as an experiment, but on an ongoing basis in all the works where it fits. </li><li>  The implementation of the scheme should be carried out carefully and must take into account the human factor. </li></ol><br><h5>  The author of the article </h5><br>  Unfortunately, this experiment took place without my participation, therefore many important moments for me remained unknown.  As you know, practice is a criterion of truth and the resulting economic effect means that this tool has the right to exist. <br><br><h4>  Instead of an afterword </h4><br><ol><li>  I express my deep gratitude to Rustam Davletbaev and Artur Nurgaliyev for a bold and sudden step. </li><li>  For those who are interested in economics, I recommend that you familiarize yourself with another experiment conducted in Shaimuratovo.  The essence of the experiment is to launch a coupon system based on the principles of free money Silvio Gezel.  The results are also very interesting. <br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/TpVwv29B3qk%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700255,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhgg-Y1WCXVSyFqU7_K4gmaLZZl5ig" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br></li></ol></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/155533/">https://habr.com/ru/post/155533/</a></p>
