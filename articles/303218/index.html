The first mini-interview we took from one of the developers of the Python language <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/it_people/blog/302970/">Andrei Svetlov</a> . <br><br>  Continues a series of posts conversation with a Python-developer from Scrapinghub <a href="http://sibiryakov.eu/">Alexander Sibiryakov</a> , who has been living in the Czech Republic for 4 years.  In what direction will Python develop, what hinders the development of the language, is it possible for a Russian developer to get a job in the Czech Republic, and how does the Russian IT industry differ from the Czech one? Read about it under the cut. <br><br> <a href="https://fotki.yandex.ru/next/users/it-people-ekb/album/502674/view/1185575%3Fpage%3D3"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1d6/4a5/447/1d64a5447eaf1730c32bfa021e1199f6.jpg" width="800" height="533"></a> <br><h6>  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DhV929rp1YmI%26list%3DPLRdS-n5seLRqGHVrXZHxXfdw--aAsMdiL%26index%3D16">Alexander's speech</a> at PyCon-2015 </h6><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>- How did you come to the development in python?</b>

      - Well, it all started back in Yandex.  It has often been used to automate simple operations and wrappers for C ++ applications. <br><br>  <b>- What is the best and worst part of your work?</b> <br><br>  - The best, perhaps, complex engineering tasks.  And the worst is hard to say.  I like my job. <br><br>  <b>- What do you consider your main achievement in life and career at the moment?</b> <br><br>  - The main achievement in life is a family: three children, a beautiful wife and many relatives.  In a career - this, of course, is work in the search department of Yandex.  I saw how real professionals work, and I was able to learn a lot from them, acquire important character traits and skills.  Now 99% of the proposals on the labor market for me mean degradation in technical terms.  It is very difficult to find a job that suits me. <br><br>  <b>- In your opinion, in what direction will Python develop in the coming years?</b> <br><br>  - New syntactic constructions will be added and old ones will be improved.  For language developers, code readability is a very important priority.  Also, the standard library code will be slightly rewritten to achieve greater performance.  It is unlikely that we will get a product that effectively uses multiple processor cores or a graphics processor. <br><br>  <b>- What, in your opinion, is the most important issue facing the Python developer community now?</b> <br><br>  - Long-term strategy in the interpreter is largely determined by one person.  I am not in favor of such an OSS development process.  Community members very often do not understand the difference between an open source and an open source development process.  The code can be opened, and the process is proprietary.  In my opinion, it hinders development.  In the Java community, the situation is different. <br><br>  <b>- What tools do you use to organize work (including time planning, work space organization, etc.)?</b> <br><br>  - I have a stationary computer with a very large amount of memory and a modern processor running Mac OS X. For development, I use PyCharm.  You will be surprised, but a very important tool in my work is a sofa.  A break of 30 minutes during the day makes me much more productive. <br><br>  <b>- What information resources could you recommend to colleagues for the development of skills?</b> <br><br>  - <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HackerNews</a> , as well as participation in conferences. <br><br>  <b>- Are you able to comply with work &amp; life balance?</b>  <b>If so, how, if not, do you need it at all?</b> <br><br>  - With varied success.  After the birth of twins, life immediately began to prevail;) It is very important to constantly prioritize tasks and manage your time. <br><br>  <b>- How much do you already live in the Czech Republic?</b>  <b>Why moved here?</b> <br><br>  - 4 years.  The Czech Republic is very close to the Russian person in spirit and has good communication with Russia.  Also in the Czech Republic are many Russians and immigrants from the ex-USSR.  I constantly go to Russia and keep in touch, I am not going to give up my citizenship either. <br><br>  <b>- How is your work organized?</b>  <b>Do you go to the office?</b>  <b>Are there any differences from Russian companies?</b> <br><br>  - Scrapinghub is a fully distributed company.  I rent an office for two with a familiar developer.  At work, I constantly advise Scrapinghub developers, external customers, just people who come to Github for help, manage the development of Frontera.  The rest of the time I am engaged in one internal project.  We are currently working with one student on the containerization of Frontera as part of the Google Summer of Code. <br><br>  <b>- Do you know the Czech language?</b>  <b>How long did you get used to local life?</b>  <b>Are there any features?</b> <br><br>  - I think that I know the language well.  I got used to the local life for the first year.  There are many features, ranging from mentality to products.  But all this is minor compared to Finland or the United States.  I managed to work in two Czech companies.  In my opinion, in Russia in the IT industry, in general, a lot more life. <br><br>  <b>- Is it possible for a Russian developer to get a job in a Czech company?</b>  <b>Can you give any advice?</b> <br><br>  - It is possible, but you must be a professional with a higher education or already have permission to stay in the Czech Republic.  If you want engineering growth, it is better to choose another country.  And if you are interested in the standard of living, then the Czech Republic is very interesting.  In the Czech Republic, the balance of income and expenses is one of the best in Europe. <br><br> <a href="https://fotki.yandex.ru/next/users/it-people-ekb/album/169532/view/1422570"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a1c/34a/75c/a1c34a75c1e97ef45f502b7db0263fda.jpg" width="800" height="533"></a> <br><br>  You can talk with Alexander personally, ask your questions on July 3-4 at the conference <a href="http://pycon.ru/2016/program/speakers/%3Futm_source%3Dnews%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3Dhabr14.06">PyCon Russia</a> , which will be held near Moscow. <br><br>  Thanks to our sponsors: General Sponsor - <a href="https://www.ptsecurity.ru/">Positive Technologies</a> , Gold Sponsor - <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/">JetBrains</a> , Silver Sponsor - <a href="http://rambler-co.ru/jobs">Rambler &amp; Co</a> , Bronze Sponsor - <a href="https://ostrovok.ru/">Ostrovok.ru</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/303218/">https://habr.com/ru/post/303218/</a></p>
