  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Computer Noise Isolation</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Having read <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/apple/53979/">article on Habr√©</a> about Macintosh upgrade (replacement of the hard drive with iMac).  I saw in the comments <a href="http://torrents.ru/forum/viewtopic.php%3Ft%3D1449491">link to manuals</a> for Apple service centers.  I looked at the manuals, because it was incredibly interesting, what was inside them.  It turned out, the manuals were very informative on the pictures, and on some people noticed, as it turned out the screen was free from interference, but the first thing that occurred to me was that it was soundproofing. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/256/345/c2f/256345c2fb5ebc6c949615a5f504f143.png" alt="Screen Interference on iMac"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/582/b6f/31f/582b6f31f0c0418b00eef060cf67e7e0.png" alt="Screen Interference on iMac"></a> <br>  Immediately I thought that this could be applied to my computer.  As it turned out, the idea was not new, and many overclocking forums have already been discussed many times.  Many offered to use car Shumkov.  The best options, as they say, turned out to be ripened polyethylene-paralon or automotive double-sided.  They say that felt is most effective, but the temperature inside the sistemnik rises.  A variant with an isolon (porous material on a bitumen substrate) was also proposed.  In general, there were lots of options.  Starting from a heap of the cheapest mouse pads ending just parallel.  Someone on the forum wrote that with linoleum works fine. <br><br>  I was going to try with automotive insulation, but then I remembered that on hand there are the remnants of linoleum, which I now just come in handy.  But at the same time we will find out whether this noise insulation works at all, and do not stain the inside of the case. <br><br>  And so, I started.  It was decided to cut the pieces so that they do not need to be glued.  Initially, automotive insulation was planned to be glued to the side walls and the front panel from the inside, as well as on top.  But in the case of linoleum, something had to change a little.  Pieces should be inserted inside, and then inserted the left side wall.  I decided not to isolate the right wall, because, as there are technological holes down there, besides, I have a rather massive cooler on my processor - BigTyphoon VX120.  I think further, where and how to cut technology holes, everything is clear, so a few photos.

      The front wall strongly resisted when removed, but still I won it. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/69e/b38/bcd/69eb38bcd24d4c707f3af45565803582.jpg" alt="Soundproofing computer case"></a> <a href=""><img src="http://pic.ipicture.ru/uploads/090317/SIG1ivN2k9.jpg" alt="Soundproofing computer case"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6dd/d77/e36/6ddd77e36da157b256f09968adbbba0a.jpg" alt="Soundproofing computer case"></a> <br><br>  All technological holes remained. <br>  Upon completion, the work was ironed, as well as before the work began. <br>  Nowhere, nothing superfluous has appeared. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/62f/b8c/59a/62fb8c59ab70aa417984dc34d1b183b6.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br>  The body has become tangible heavier, due to this vibration is extinguished.  All mechanical noise disappeared completely!  Now, no crunching of the disk, no processor grunting while calculating.  As for the temperature, in my opinion it has not changed at all.  The feeling is rather strange when you run some kind of test, be it SiSoft Sandra or any game, but you do not hear any cracking.  It is certainly audible, if you really come very close to it, at a distance of less than 5 cm and specially listen, and then the sound is very muffled. <br><br>  Isolation did not save from aerodynamic noise.  Even, probably, they have become stronger stand out, because, as against their background, there is no extraneous other noise.  But take off, you have to fight in other ways.  I, for example, the main noise comes from the fan on the top of the case.  Apparently it will have to be removed or replaced with a low-speed one. <br><br>  PS This is my first post on Habr√©, so that you do not judge strictly.  And thank you very much, to the people from the jabber conference on jabber.ru, for helping with karma. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/54766/">https://habr.com/ru/post/54766/</a></p>
