Its natural continuation will not even be an article, but rather a question for you,% username%, about how to now find a desired job for a person who has just received a diploma.  Or, worse, not yet received. <br><br>  It would seem - here it is to Jobs.ru \ Jobs.mail.ru \ etc, here they are - open vacancies, and everything seems to suit you, you send a practically perfectly prepared resume - and ... silence.  And so you can wait a very long time.

      However, the reasons for this phenomenon seemed to me somewhat unusual. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  It all started with the fact that I needed a duty eniky.  The little man who was supposed to sit in the office from 10 to 19, clean the printer, order consumables, tell users where the necessary button is, occasionally roll up pouring onto the system loggers and more seriously, call me right away.  Although the salary of 25 thousand is not considered particularly high in the field of IT, but for the above duties, in my opinion, it was more than enough. <br><br>  We placed a vacancy on a fairly popular site, and waited for a reaction.  She followed, to put it mildly, immediately.  The very next day I had 492 (!!!) responses in my mailbox, of which 19 were repeated at least twice. <br><br>  It was a complete tin.  When I first encountered a similar phenomenon, it became clear to me why my resumes went, in essence, ‚Äúnowhere‚Äù.  After all, if there is no filter for certain parameters (age, education, specialty, experience), then you have to choose without even reading the resume - just at random, 20-30 people.  And if such a filter is there, then I, with my incomplete higher education and 1989 year of birth, in spite of all the certificates, skills and experience, I‚Äôm not going through to a job with a decent salary. <br><br>  But this is only half the trouble. <br><br>  We all know very well that the current situation with IT education in Russia, to put it mildly, is not too encouraging to employers.  After all, the average ‚Äúspecialist‚Äù who graduated with a diploma even from a high-level university has practically no real work experience, and in most cases no practical value.  Remember that about 8 years ago the specialty "programmer" was in great demand and was considered incredibly "elite".  Behind such a desirable crust, full lines of applicants lined up in state and private universities. <br><br>  And about the level of preparation I will not tell anything.  And so everything is up to date, I think. <br><br>  So it turns out that the very concept of a ‚Äúyoung IT-specialist‚Äù is today undeservedly discredited in the eyes of the employer.  What I learned from my own experience, conducting interviews with such guys.  They have "cool" diplomas, they even know "tse two pluses" and assembler ... <br><br>  ... but the domain can not be distinguished from the working group.  So it is, sorry, not even the basics ... <br><br>  In the end, I decided not to risk it.  I just had to close the vacancy, throw 10 thousand rubles and duties to my salary, and take a good friend to this place.  Without a diploma and not knowing "tse two plus." <br><br>  In the current situation, it is clear that the standard "resume contest" in the field of IT is no longer something that is useless, but even harmful.  But the preliminary selection of candidates is done, again, only on the basis of their resume.  In fact, the same competition. <br><br>  What to do,% username%? .. How to replace the standard "selection system"?  After all, I don‚Äôt have many good acquaintances who are unemployed, and there are even fewer familiar bosses who need specialists in the field of IT ... <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/85124/">https://habr.com/ru/post/85124/</a></p>
