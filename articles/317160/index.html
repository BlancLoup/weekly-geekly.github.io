Today I want to share an interesting case.  If you are developing websites, landing pages or selling something over the Internet, this will be a good experience.  The essence of the article is to show how simplicity in the structure of the site, combined with the use of trend technologies and instant messengers, can produce amazing results. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I do online advertising, I have a lot of clients from different countries in different areas of business.  Once, an old customer contacted me and made a claim.  He is engaged in issuing visas to a large number of different countries of the world.  The essence of his claim was that his business practically ceased to make a profit.  That is, the cost of advertising, which I do to him, almost became equal to net profit.  I knew in advance that sooner or later this client would turn to me with this claim, because his website left much to be desired: it was an old-fashioned design, developed many years ago.  Not only was the design very bad, the site itself also contained a lot of text, various terrible cons.  For example, there was such a stock counter, which displayed a countdown and prompted a visa right now with a big discount.  Various crossed out prices and the word "ACTION" in large print scattered throughout the site.  About the normal display on mobile devices, I generally keep quiet.  In general, it was a typical landing page, which can be found on sites that promise an iPhone at a price of 6999 rubles at a discount and gifts just today.  It hasn't worked for a long time, if ever it ever worked. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/296/fee/8ed/296fee8ed3de4a97bdd77a94757afc09.jpg">

      I explained to the client that time does not stand still, that competitors make excellent websites, and advised him to simply make a few queries to Google related to his business, and be convinced of this.  Fortunately, the client understands, and immediately replied to me that, in principle, I agree with my arguments.  Since we are engaged in advertising, we have partners in various areas, including partners who are engaged in the development of websites, I offered their services, and the client decided to allocate a budget.  I promised that the conversion will increase several times.  According to my rough calculations, it should have grown at least 2-4 times. <br><br>  We have developed a great new site.  The design was modern, contained little text, adaptability made it possible to display it on smartphones and tablets as well as on a PC.  Made an amazing online application form.  We have implemented a communication system with Intercom visitors (live chat on the site).  In general, it was a good job.  I was pleased with the client too.  We changed the logic and reworked all advertisements in the contextual advertising systems, given the new changes on the site.  A few days have passed, I looked at the conversion statistics.  And how surprised I was when I saw the numbers.  The number of applications from the site has not increased twice.  Growth was, but not as expected.  The client did not contact me, and I decided to do it myself, report on the failure and offer any compensation, since I did not keep the promise.  But to my surprise, the client was not angry.  He said that the applications from the site may not have grown, but the number of calls to their support service and live chat has greatly increased.  And there the managers were already politely answering questions and communicating many requests before issuing visas.  It turned out that the reduction of the text on the site prompted customers to ask a lot of questions and clarifications. <br><br>  I generally love technology.  I really like the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãchatbots, and in general I interact a lot with my clients via instant messengers.  I think that this is the future.  For example, if you take China or other Asian countries, there is a huge percentage of goods and services sold through Line, WeChat, and so on.  And I had the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãan experiment for my client.  I proposed to create a simple landing page, not even a landing page, but a ‚Äúone-screen‚Äù page that would contain a bit of beautiful graphics, a text about what the company does, and a few buttons that would allow you to immediately contact the company through various instant messengers + live chat, which actively offers to engage in correspondence with the manager.  The logic is that the client wants to get a service, and it‚Äôs easier for him to immediately ask a question rather than look for information.  With a potential buyer, you immediately need to begin to interact, and with proper and polite communication, you can be prompted to buy a product / service. <br><br>  We quickly developed a simple but beautiful page that fit onto a standard laptop or PC screen without scrolling.  They wrote what the company does, set the flags of the countries to which we issue visas, and placed several buttons in the center.  One button opened the live chat and allowed to start chatting with the manager.  The second button threw the client on the Telegram-bot, but it was not exactly a bot, he could not automatically respond, and all messages were sent to the managers.  The third button, by analogy with the second, but it was Facebook Messenger.  Fourth viber.  We decided to go ahead and wrote a simple application for iOS and Android, which allowed managers to write from the application.  The fifth and sixth buttons offered to download the application.  All this is very simple to organize, now there are platforms that specialize in this.  We did everything through <a href="https://smooch.io/">Smooch</a> .  Messages from all channels came in one web interface.  In our case it was HipChat, yours could be Slack, Zendesk, Help Scout or just an email. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/471/c90/3de/471c903de97848928ebea5d956aebc18.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The result was simply amazing.  Of course there were no more applications from the site.  But there were very, very many requests through various channels on various issues related to visa processing.  We previously reworked advertisements in contextual advertising systems.  By the way, as additional links in Google Adwords and Yandex.Direct, you can specify a direct link to your bots in Telegram and Facebook Messenger, which will allow potential customers to immediately click on the ad and write to you.  If we compare the number of completed transactions of the first (old) site with the new ‚Äúinteracting‚Äù landing, then, with the same advertising costs, the client received 6 times more transactions.  Everyone was happy with such results. <br><br>  How to use this information is up to you.  Personally, I am finishing an online advertising project based on this idea.  But I can definitely say that this is the future.  It is very convenient for people to buy goods / services through messages.  In addition, it is a global trend.  Take the startups that appear on this ground: <a href="http://operator.com/">Operator.com</a> , <a href="https://pana.com/">Pana.com,</a> and so on.  Take an informational background that supports chat bots, instant messengers.  Use it! <br><br>  I hope that the article was interesting and informative.  Good luck! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/317160/">https://habr.com/ru/post/317160/</a></p>
