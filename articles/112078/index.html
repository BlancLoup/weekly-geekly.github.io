This international exhibition has been held since 1967 in various US cities, and since 1994 only in Las Vegas and only in January.  At the beginning of each year, all major market players bring their new products there, asking trends for the next year. <br><br>  CES 2011 was held from 6 to 9 January.  Here is what we showed there: <br><img src="http://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/5003/samsungrussia.22/0_52aa2_23bfd3d6_L" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>Slider Tablet Samsung Sliding PC 7 Series</b> <br><img src="http://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/5700/samsungrussia.22/0_52aa3_9ff9224a_L" alt="image">

      The fruit of the joint work of Samsung and Microsoft, the new tablet with a diagonal of 10.1 inches in one hand turns into a netbook with a keyboard.  The slider-tablet works on the Windows 7 platform (it is especially convenient in touch control), and more than 40 Samsung applications are pre-installed on it. <br><br>  Powered by SSD hard drives, the Sliding PC 7 Series features ultra-fast loading and almost instant access to content.  SSD supports full multitasking in both tablet mode and laptop mode.  It takes only a few seconds after switching on, and the Sliding PC 7 Series is fully operational.  Slider-tablet is equipped with an extended battery that provides battery life up to 9 hours from charging to charging. <br><br>  Look at him, as well as the Galaxy Player and so on.  can be in <a href="http://www.tested.com/ces-2011-samsung-booth-tour/47-256/">this video review</a> from Tested.Com <br><br>  <b>LED TVs of the 7000 and 8000 series</b> <br><br><img src="http://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/5900/samsungrussia.22/0_52aa4_f6a1b695_L" alt="image"><br><br>  The 7000 and 8000 LED TVs presented at the exhibition were complemented by innovations aimed at making smart TV even smarter - for example, the new version of Internet @ TV.  We expect that 2011 will be a turning point for smart TVs.  Therefore, almost all new models with a diagonal of 40 inches will support the installation of applications and Internet access.  In total this year we will present about 30 new TV models with screen sizes from 19 to 65 inches in 9 product series. <br><br>  The entire line of TVs in 2011 is characterized by improved image quality, regardless of its format: 2D, 3D, HD, or streaming video.  Due to new technologies, the picture quality has improved significantly.  As the author High-Def-Digest.com <a href="http://hdgear.highdefdigest.com/news/show/Samsung/CES_2011/HDTVs/Google_TV/Samsung_Booth_Tour_CES_2011/6118">writes</a> in his review, the colors have become even richer, and the black color is darker (which is especially important in LCD TVs). <br><br>  In the new line was applied a number of design innovations.  Thus, the case of some models received a special thin frame, which made it possible to increase the screen size without significantly increasing the size of the TV.  For example, the newest LED TVs of the D8000 series have an impressive body with an ultrathin frame, just 0.2 inches wide.  Also, all the TVs in this series come bundled with the brand-new Bluetooth 3D glasses and the innovative TwinView Touch Control.  The console has a built-in 3 ‚Äùtouch screen, which among other things, can be used as an additional TV screen. <br><br>  Some TVs of the new line are equipped with the new Smart Hub service.  The company's engineers were able to improve and combine promising and popular applications and services in one powerful service and now it includes: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Search All utility (easy intuitive search); <br>  ‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúYour Video‚Äù service, which gives recommendations based on the viewing history; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Internet browser; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Samsung Apps. <br><br>  For details on improving the quality of the image, see this <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DFA6Ytqf7JC8">video</a> . <br><br>  <b>The world's largest 3D TV</b> <br><br><img src="http://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/5900/samsungrussia.22/0_52aa5_c30e85b6_L" alt="image"><br><br>  The diagonal of the biggest today smart TV Samsung UE65C8000 - 75 inches.  We broke the record (65 inches), which, however, we set ourselves. <br><br>  The TV is part of the 8000 series and is equipped with the most advanced technologies of the company - 3D HyperReal Engine, 200Hz Motion Plus and Mega Contrast.  The processor is capable of real-time conversion of a standard 2D image into 3D, giving volume to television programs, films and even photos.  The TV screen is equipped with a proprietary Samsung Ultra Clear Panel, which effectively absorbs external light and avoids glare. <br><br>  By the way, we <a href="http://www.samsung.com/ru/news/newsRead.do%3Fnews_seq%3D22903%26page%3D1%26gltype%3Dlocalnews">showed</a> this TV in Russia in early December. <br><br>  <b>3D projector SP-A8000</b> <br><br><img src="http://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/5300/samsungrussia.22/0_52aa6_36324c07_L" alt="image"><br><br>  This stereoprojector unfolds the image to 1080 pixels in HD in both 2D and 3D.  The luminous flux is about 1000 lumens (more powerful than, for example, a 60W incandescent lamp).  The contrast ratio is 10,000 to 1. As with other Samsung stereo products, you need 3D shutter glasses to watch. <br><br>  <b>Samsung Lightweight 9 Series Laptops</b> <br><br><img src="http://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/4701/samsungrussia.22/0_52aa7_413d5e02_L" alt="image"><br><br>  Thanks to the efforts of designers, researchers and developers, the ease of a laptop (1.31 kg) was achieved, and its ‚Äúaerodynamic‚Äù style was developed.  Laptops 9 series with a diagonal of 13 inches are made of duralumin, a lightweight material that is used in aviation, two times more durable than aluminum.  Laptops are equipped with a SuperBright Plus screen that displays more than 16 million colors and gives a rich and clear image. <br><br>  The new laptops are equipped with a second-generation Intel Core i7 / i5 processor that supports up to 8 GB of RAM and Intelligent Turbo Boost 2.0 technology.  Proprietary technology Fast Booting (start the laptop from the off state) allows users to start working at the computer within 12 seconds after launch. <br><br>  With PowerPlus technology and a new lithium-polymer battery, the Samsung 9 Series laptops can work up to three times longer than regular laptops. <br><br>  As you understand, this is not all of what we showed at CES.  But get ready for new surprises: the Galaxy Tab S2 will be <a href="http://www.samsungunpacked.com/">showcased</a> on February 13 at the MWC in Barcelona. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/112078/">https://habr.com/ru/post/112078/</a></p>
