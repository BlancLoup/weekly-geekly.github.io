With the introduction of virtualization and the growing popularity of the cloud model, the corresponding backup tools are also evolving, covering more and more virtual environments, operating systems and applications.  So how to organize a backup of the virtual environment at the proper level?  How hard is it? <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c7b/852/15c/c7b85215c4070844316c054dd0e4aff8.jpg"></div><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Until now, there is a perception that, with all its advantages, virtualization makes backup much more difficult.  Perhaps this is one of the reasons why companies ignore the need to protect the virtual environment: according to information from foreign analytical agencies, backup procedures cover less than 70% of virtual servers. <br><br>  In fact, everything is not so difficult.  Regardless of the hypervisor used, such as Hyper-V or VMware, the approaches to backing up virtual machines (VMs) are the same.  It can be performed at the host level (or, as it is also called, at the hypervisor level), or at the VM level.  Currently, a variety of products of the most diverse class are offered for backing up virtual environments.  Some companies use specialized solutions designed specifically for a specific hypervisor, others prefer universal products.

      The recovery process in a virtual environment has its own specifics.  Instead of restoring the entire VM image, most backup products allow you to restore a single file or group of VM files.  And the backup itself can be stored in the cloud, in a remote data center.  This method is becoming increasingly popular.  In this case, data is usually copied locally and then replicated to the cloud (Cloud Backup).  Redundancy in the cloud does not solve all the problems of local protection and high availability, but protects against accidents (DR). <br><br>  New features of backup products help to more effectively and quickly restore virtual machines, applications and data in case of failure, to find the necessary balance between the allowable recovery time (Recovery Time Objective, RTO), allowable data loss (Recovery Point Objective, RPO) and the cost of the solution.  Below we will discuss one of these solutions. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#002f55">Backup is easy</font> </h2><br>  Altaro VM Backup is an easy-to-use backup solution with an intuitive interface and easy setup.  More than 30 thousand companies use it for reliable storage and recovery of Hyper-V and VMware virtual machines.  According to user reviews, Altaro VM Backup is installed many times faster than competitive solutions and has a very convenient and intuitive interface.  This software supports backup and recovery of VMs between different servers and different types of storage for backups - local (DAS), external (NAS / SAN) and cloud (Cloud Backup). <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f94/181/ea3/f94181ea3e74c9d15c7096b4bbff9cdd.jpg"><br>  The Altaro software, previously known as Altaro Hyper-V Backup, is aimed at companies in the SMB segment.  That is why the developers have tried to make it as simple and intuitive as possible, but with all the necessary small and medium business.  The sixth version of the product released last year supports VM backups in Microsoft Hyper-V and VMware vSphere environments, which is why it is now called Altaro VM Backup. <br>  We list its main features: <br><br><ul><li>  Hyper-V support in Windows Server 2008 R2 and later. <br></li><li>  VMware vSphere 5.6 and later support. <br></li><li>  Exchange Server item level reservations. <br></li><li>  ReverseDelta incremental backup technology. <br></li><li>  Replicate backups to another site. <br></li><li>  Data compression, reducing backup volume by about 25%. <br></li><li>  Backup encryption. <br></li><li>  Instant file level recovery. <br></li><li>  Restore to the sandbox Sandbox Restore to check the integrity of the backup and the very possibility to restore it. <br></li><li>  Support Microsoft Exchange and SQL. <br></li><li>  Full Microsoft Cluster Shared Volumes support. <br></li><li>  The ability to restore the VM on different systems. <br></li><li>  Individual, defined for individual VMs, backup and storage policies. <br></li></ul><br>  Often, system administrators dislike backup tools, many of which have a complex user interface with many never-used options, or simply do not work and generate errors.  Altaro VM Backup does not apply to those: few products are so easy to install and to work with.  All tasks are performed through convenient procedures.  And the <a href="http://www.vmbackup.ru/price">price</a> of Altaro VM Backup is quite attractive.  <a href="http://www.vmbackup.ru/">Altaro VM Backup</a> can be tested for free for 30 days.  An unlimited free version is also offered, but it only supports two VMs per host system. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#002f55">What's new in Altaro VM Backup 6.0?</font> </h2><br>  In addition to VMware support, version 6.0 offers the following new tools: <br><br><ol><li>  <b>Centralized configuration and management of multiple host systems.</b> <br>  The user interface allows you to customize the configuration of backup / restore jobs for multiple hosts and manage all of these tasks.  Control over all VMs is carried out from one console. <br><br></li><li>  <b>Parallel work with host systems to speed up backups.</b> <br>  Backup jobs can be run on multiple hosts at the same time, which significantly reduces backup times. <br><br></li><li>  <b>Automatic download of error reports.</b> <br>  Reports are generated automatically and sent to customer support for troubleshooting. <br><br></li><li>  <b>LiveChat is built into Altaro Console.</b> <br>  You can chat with Altaro support directly from the application in the chat. <br></li></ol><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fe0/1dd/3d1/fe01dd3d137be7a203a0e2ad3648550c.png"><br><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Communication options with customer support</font></i> <br><br><h2>  <font color="#002f55">What does Altaro VM Backup include?</font> </h2><br>  Altaro VM Backup includes four key components: <br><br><ul><li>  The main application <b>Altaro VM Backup</b> . <br></li><li>  <b>Hyper-V</b> Software <b>Agent</b> . <br></li><li>  <b>Altaro Remote Management Tools</b> . <br></li><li>  Utility <b>Altaro Offsite Server</b> to copy to another site. <br></li></ul><br><h2>  <font color="#002f55">Installation process</font> </h2><br>  Installing Altaro VM Backup is not easy, but very simple.  Just run the installer, click "Next" a couple of times, and that's it.  No additional components need to be installed.  After the process is completed and Altaro VM Backup is launched, a connection is established with an instance of the program on one of the servers, for example, localhost.  The required port (35107) is already registered in the interface. <br>  The next step is to connect with <br><br><ul><li>  Hyper-V host or failover cluster. <br></li><li>  ESXi host (if vCenter Server is unavailable) <br></li><li>  vCenter Server <br></li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ce9/21b/3f9/ce921b3f9b33d940b2e737541ae7ceb1.png"><br><br>  For example, let's choose an ESXi host.  The connection will require a name, hostname, account, and password.  Ports 443 and 902 (vSphere VDDK) must be open.  After the connection with the host is established, you need to choose a place for data backup - local (USB, eSATA, iSCSI) or a network device.  Of course, for reliability, it is preferable to store backups on removable media or on another site, for example, to set up replication over the global network.  Stored VM data is encrypted. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6bb/c27/ddb/6bbc27ddb48cd84cfc2a8bfb7e394d29.png"><br><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Backup storage locations</font></i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9b9/446/c56/9b9446c56b27c9cbeb02cc35c537b8f9.png"><br><br>  <i><font color="#999999">The monitoring console shows information on backup tasks, backup on a third-party site and backup storage.</font></i> <br><br>  For a clearer understanding, we will describe the process of installing and launching the product step by step. <br><br><ol><li>  Download and install Altaro VM Backup on a computer with Windows one of the versions listed below.  This could be a Hyper-V host, then skip step 2. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fdf/c4b/e43/fdfc4be4372bbaf7981a24f45282255a.png"></div><br><br></li><li>  Add hosts (of the following) to the Altaro console. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5e4/f11/073/5e4f1107345ed8288719867d23f42eb7.png"></div><br><br></li><li>  Choose a place to store a backup.  This can be an external USB or eSATA drive, a network drive, or a SAN / NAS device. <br><br></li><li>  Optionally, for remote management of Altaro, we connect via RDP to the server where the product is installed, or install Altaro Remote Management Tools. <br><br></li><li>  Optionally, install Altaro Offsite Server on a machine outside the local network and send backups there via WAN / VPN / Internet.  This is in case of disaster recovery for major troubles. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ef7/593/f5a/ef7593f5adca315b22e97c7e314bfe29.png"></div></li></ol><br>  That's all.  From the start of the installation to the launch of the backup process, it usually takes about ten minutes. <br>  The initial creation of a backup may take a lot of time and create a load on the network.  Therefore, you can simply copy the data to removable media and transfer them to another site, and transfer subsequent copies over the global network - this process will no longer be so resource-intensive.  This option supports the product. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6b3/c61/b08/6b3c61b08b6d71206bea2fc3bf6586d4.png"><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Adding a new backup storage rule.</font></i> <br><br>  Next you need to assign a storage location for the VM.  This is done by simply dragging the VM in the GUI to the target storage and clicking the ‚ÄúSave Changes‚Äù button.  It remains to create a backup.  Select a VM and click "Reserve."  Now you can set up a copy schedule. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#002f55">Creating consistent copies of applications</font> </h2><br>  Altaro supports the creation of consistent copies of applications using Microsoft VSS technology.  This means that after a VM is restored, an application with VSS support will not be ‚Äúcorrupted‚Äù.  To work with application logs such as Exchange Server or SQL, you need to install Altaro VM Tools.  This can be done remotely using the management console. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#002f55">Backup Verification</font> </h2><br>  How to make sure that the backup can really recover?  This is often simply forgotten.  In Altaro VM Backup, two verification methods are proposed - by checksums and by actual recovery of VMs.  The first, Backup Verification, allows you to simply verify the integrity of the data on the media.  The second, Sandbox Restore, will allow you to sleep peacefully.  Both options can be planned to automate this process. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c96/80e/345/c9680e345cce5b410f72c5ab2ffb203b.png"><br><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Reports window shows backup status, verification result and restore tasks</font></i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/337/9d6/6a5/3379d66a55a5989238d7812d359d6bdc.png"><br><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Setting up and planning Sandbox Restore</font></i> <br><br>  Sandbox Restore restores VM under a temporary name.  The administrator can start it and make sure that it loads.  This will not affect the operation of other VMs. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#002f55">File recovery</font> </h2><br>  There are three ways to recover files: <br><br><ol><li>  Restore the entire VM on the same or on a different host system. <br></li><li>  By recovery at the file level. <br></li><li>  Exchange item level recovery. <br></li></ol><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/675/b2d/01b/675b2d01b08972d0f69e82a20cf4133e.png"><br><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Recovery from Exchange at the item level</font></i> <br><br>  The second method is very simple and runs in steps.  Select VM, virtual hard disk and files to recover.  Altaro VM Backup recovers files in a special folder, then it remains to copy them to the VM. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/083/202/f15/083202f15d85c58e12a655fab7674ccf.png"><br><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Directly from the Altaro console, you can perform granular restoration, for example, restore a file or mailbox</font></i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fde/e6a/5d8/fdee6a5d81afd16defe5358db5cdcc2e.png"><br><br>  <i><font color="#999999">The control panel Altaro VM Backup in a visual form shows all the necessary information</font></i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5cd/4f2/711/5cd4f2711e84d1c2bc6afc8a7e680e8b.png"><br><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Backup planning</font></i> <br><br><h2>  <font color="#002f55">findings</font> </h2><br>  What technology or VM backup product, which approach is best used in specific circumstances?  What should I look for first?  There is no definite answer to this question - it all depends on the corporate policy, procedures and requirements of the business, the size of the company and other factors.
