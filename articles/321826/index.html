  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Getting to know the team of Java stack courses on Hexlet</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hi, Habrayuzer.  We have long wanted to get a little closer to you.  And today, such a long-lasting idea to tell you in more detail about the fact that ‚Äúwho and what courses of the Java stack does Hexlet do‚Äù has come true!  As I think, it became clear: we will tell you about the courses we have been working on for the last half year, including the most recent course that was about to start recording: <a href="https://ru.hexlet.io/courses/java-webservices">Java for Web services</a> . <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0f9/bd7/43c/0f9bd743cdb64062a53bcb802d89d85e.png"></div><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Why us?  Cookies: </h3><br>  From the very beginning of the creation of courses, we formulated a very simple principle: <br><br><blockquote>  "We do not think that it is easy to become a programmer, but we will give everything that is necessary for this" </blockquote><br>  The main idea that was from the very beginning, a few years ago, was to give knowledge based on real experience.  And I did not leave work to begin to prepare the material more often or to devote more time to preparing the slides.  So for what people come to us is an opportunity to learn Java from a person who works in the industry.  Not from an experienced teacher who knows how to prepare a presentation well, but he has not worked on a real project for five years, but from a person who solves real problems at work every day and knows the inside story.  Actually, the project is developing to this day.  We will not tell you that programming is easy and simple, we will not tell you that our ‚Äúcertified‚Äù specialist will answer your question within 30 minutes after its publication, this is not for us, but we have a lot of real ‚Äúhardcore‚Äù which will not be easy but will give you a lot of what a good engineer needs.  Here you and your hands create different data structures and a basic understanding of what a byte code is and the ability to create and deploy your own web service from scratch (about this, by the way, our new course). 
      <br>

        <ins class="adsbygoogle"

        </script>
      <br>
      At this point, many people may have a question: will I pull the material?  Or: what should I know to start?  And we have extremely good news for you, just need to have a master's degree in computer science!  Just kidding!  Everything is much simpler, no need to know anything in programming, the only requirement in order to start is the presence of a PC and desire (and of course time).  Try it and see for yourself! <br><br>  Well, now let's actually talk about courses issued in the last six months (it would be possible to write from the moment of publication of the last article from our team, but we haven‚Äôt published one).  So, from freshly airing: Java: Multithreading (Concurrency), Java Generics (generic types) and also in the process already mentioned, Java for Web Services.  From accompanying material there are open <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist%3Flist%3DPLsQAG1V_t58COuo7oRYsvdvwa9mfUK8RS">Machine Learning</a> lessons. <br><br>  Recently, we started a ‚Äúreality show‚Äù with one of the students, which takes place in the real time where I study with a real student selected from among the students on Heksleth.  The process ends when he gets his first job offer in a real job: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist%3Flist%3DPLsQAG1V_t58BZtW5I9BCfqWBD6iAbPkEr">Geeks.Show</a> . <br><br><h3>  Java: Multithreading (Concurrency), in which salt: </h3><br>  Hope everyone knows the definition of multithreading in <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259C%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D1%2587%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D1%258C">Wikipedia</a> ?  <a href="https://ru.hexlet.io/courses/concurrency">This</a> course is narrated and shown in practice about multithreading in the world of Java.  Starting from the statement of the problem / problem and going directly to the syntax and principles of working with threads in the Java world.  And this is not only the creation and launch of threads, but also work with them.  Delve into the ExecutorService, the Callable interface, and other utilities for working with threads.  Before ‚Äúimmersing in multithreading‚Äù, we recommend to go through ‚ÄúJava Generics‚Äú and have a strong basic knowledge of the Java language. <br><br><h3>  Java Generics (generic types), in which salt: </h3><br>  Here it is, one of the reasons for the flexibility of the Java language.  Generic types are a significant improvement in type independence in a given language. <br><br>  In <a href="https://ru.hexlet.io/courses/java_generics">this</a> course, we will, again, go from posing a problem to solving, through the syntax of generalized types, inheritance, constraints, and their intersection in the Java language.  We demonstrate examples in practical problems.  For a better understanding of this course, you must already know: <br><br><ul><li>  Basics: Java 101 ( <a href="https://ru.hexlet.io/courses/java_101">Introduction to Java</a> ); </li><li>  <a href="https://ru.hexlet.io/courses/collections">Java Data Structures</a> ; </li><li>  <a href="https://ru.hexlet.io/courses/bytecode">Java bytecode</a> . </li></ul><br><h3>  Java for Web Services, in which salt: </h3><br>  <a href="https://ru.hexlet.io/courses/java-webservices">This</a> course is a specialization in the direction of a Java programmer.  It will summarize and apply the knowledge gained in previous courses.  But the main feature of the course is that each of the students will create their first Web service and deploy it on a real ‚Äúcombat‚Äù service!  This course will allow you to create the first projects that you can add to your resume! <br><br><h3>  A little about us. </h3><br>  We are responsible for the direction of Java on Heckslet, as well as releasing quite a lot of free content on our <a href="http://java.kovalevskyi.com/">YouTube channel.</a> <br><br><ul><li>  Vyacheslav Kovalevsky - your humble servant, the author of all current courses on Java.  Senior development engineer (as well as applied researcher) with more than seven years of experience in the industry.  Actually I am engaged in the production of educational material, I prepare and write down lessons.  Answer questions from students.  Also one of the mentors of Heksleta, and accordingly I answer the questions of subscribers. <br><br></li><li>  Gleb Bochkarev - Engineer by education and vocation.  It helps to maintain educational content from the very beginning of its creation.  Is the PR manager of the course (actually all our presence in social networks is his merit).  He is directly involved in the creation of lessons. <br><br></li><li>  Sergey Alekseenko - Software Engineer, an amateur who has joined our team since the end of the 16th year to maintain courses and also help in creating new homework assignments.  We hope that with his help in the 17th year we will have a lot more new practices and tasks.  Answers questions from students. </li></ul><br>  In general, we still have a lot of plans, like new courses (for example, ‚Äúfunctional programming in Java‚Äù, which I like so much) and about improving old ones (rewriting Java 101, new practices, better sound, updated slides). <br><br><h4>  For communication. </h4><br>  We also have groups for communication on Java topics, where you can get help on training issues and not only: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://plus.google.com/communities/103002092207368562864">Google+</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://slack-ru.hexlet.io/">Slack</a> - group #java </li><li>  <a href="http://vk.com/java8">VK</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://facebook.com/groups/1000400156742696/">Fb</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://twitter.com/JavaHexlet">Twitter</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://java.kovalevskyi.com/">Website</a> </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/321826/">https://habr.com/ru/post/321826/</a></p>
