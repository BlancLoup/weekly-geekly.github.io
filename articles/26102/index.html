And he was in love, strongly and unresponsively, in the first beauty to the whole district.  The girl owned the hearts of almost all the young men in the area and was very much preys on her appeal. <br><br>  And then the young man decided to become a warrior, strong, brave.  And seeing a mighty fighter, in uniforms, with awards, the girl will become his wife. <br><br>  And he went to the city, to the soldiers' service.  He made his way to the officers, distinguished himself in battles, matured and returned as a hero to his native village.  But the girl did not even look in his direction.  However, she never chose her betrothed. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Then the young man decided to become rich, even then the girl would not be able to resist the expensive gifts.  He entered the service of a merchant as a bodyguard, studied with him.  And soon he opened his business, got rich and returned to his native village by all respected merchant.  But the girl indifferently accepted his gifts, only showed even more generous offerings from other applicants to her hand.

      And then the man decided to gain wisdom.  He left all his wealth to the family and went around the world to look for the mind.  He returned a few years later to his native village, reputedly a wise man.  But he did not go to the house of the beautiful woman, but began to live peacefully, sharing his wisdom with others. <br><br>  Time passed, the girl never married, considering all the proposals unworthy of her beauty.  But the flow of days is inexorable, and every new day the mirror reflected the flowing appeal of the woman.  And no one wanted to take her for a wife anymore, the exorbitant pride and arrogance scared people away. <br><br>  Left alone, a woman came to the sage and asked if he wanted to marry her.  And the sage agreed. <br><br>  People were indignant: why do you take for your wife a grumpy old woman who has done you so much evil? <br><br>  The sage smiled: I see only good - if it were not for her, I would never have become what I am now. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/26102/">https://habr.com/ru/post/26102/</a></p>
