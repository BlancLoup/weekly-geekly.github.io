  <section class="page js-page"><h1>If the "Lord of the Rings" were a project</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  On the website <a href="http://www.managethatproject.com/project-about.html">Di Ellis</a> came across an <a href="http://www.managethatproject.com/project-article3.html">interesting article</a> in which the destruction of the absolute ring from the book of Tolkien is proposed to be considered as a project.  I want to share the translation with my readers. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Imagine that the destruction of the absolute ring in the Lord of the Rings is a project.  This is not so strange - we will try to evaluate this campaign according to the following criteria: 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"

      * they had a clear goal <br>  * they had a team with clearly distributed roles <br>  * the whole team had to work together to achieve the goal <br>  * they had a clearly limited time frame <br><br>  Looks like a project, isn't it?  And if this is a project, then who was the project manager? <br><br>  The role of the project manager is as follows: <br><br>  * be responsible for achieving the objectives of the project <br>  * prepare a project plan and budget <br>  * provide project resources <br>  * monitor the execution of the plan and budget <br>  * manage the quality, risks and problems of the project (including a risk mitigation plan and contingency plan) <br>  * engage in daily project management <br>  * report progress to key stakeholders <br><br>  In my opinion, there are four applicants for the role of project manager: Aragorn, Gandalf, Frodo and Elrond.  Consider each in detail. <br><br>  <strong>Elrond</strong> <br><br>  At the council meeting, it was Elrond who announced the goals of the project and he chose those who would be in the project team. <br><br>  However, shortly thereafter, Elrond went into the shadows, and reappeared only in the final battle against Sauron.  Most of the campaign did not affect the project itself, or how it was carried out. <br><br>  Thus, we will assume that Elrond was a project sponsor or project owner. <br><br>  <strong>Frodo</strong> <br><br>  Frodo, of course, played a prominent role in the project, because it was up to him that ultimately depended on whether the team could achieve the goal or not. <br><br>  However, he had no influence on the adoption of strategic decisions in the project.  He was just doing his job. <br><br>  Therefore, we will consider Frodo to be the key executor of the project, but not the RP. <br><br>  <strong>Aragorn</strong> <br><br>  Aragorn showed remarkable leadership qualities, and made strategic and tactical decisions.  He planned attack and defense on various fortresses, and inspired troops. <br><br>  However, other members of the team did not recognize him as a leader almost until the end of the campaign.  In addition, he was not personally liable for the failure of the project, although he played a key role in the successful implementation of the project. <br><br>  We will consider Aragorn, like Frodo, a key participant in the project, but not a RP. <br><br>  <strong>Gandalf</strong> <br><br>  So, we reached Gandalf. <br><br>  Before Gandalf disappeared into the abyss of Moria, all project participants considered him to be the leader, and when he returned, he again took the reins of government in his hands.  He sent Aragorn to Theoden, and went to Helm's Pad. <br><br>  It was he who proposed to entrust the destruction of the ring to Frodo, and suggested that Sam accompany Frodo (a good move that ensured the success of the project). <br><br>  In addition, Gandalf defeated Saruman. <br><br>  The question is: If the campaign failed, could Gandalf be held responsible for this? <br><br>  I think yes. <br><br>  The original of this entry (in English) is available at: <a href="http://www.managethatproject.com/project-article3.html">http://www.managethatproject.com/project-article3.html</a> <br>  Translation of this entry is available at <a href="http://andrewkulikov.com/archives/57">http://andrewkulikov.com/archives/57</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/23509/">https://habr.com/ru/post/23509/</a></p>
