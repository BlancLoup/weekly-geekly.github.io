All dancers, wine, spree ‚Äù- the hero of the film‚Äú The Day After Tomorrow ‚Äùjoked. <br><br>  Probably, at some conferences this does not happen (share stories in the comments), but at it-meetings usually beer is used instead of wine (when finished), and instead of dancers there is ‚Äúdancing‚Äù with codes and information systems.  2 years ago we also fit into this choreography by organizing the Uptime day conference.  This April, on the Day of Cosmonautics, we are holding it for the fourth time - traditionally free of charge and traditionally to the accompaniment of the questions ‚Äúwhy do you need this?‚Äù <br>  At the spring Uptime day, we will talk about the organization of reserving web projects with complex distributed architecture - ways to switch from the combat environment to the backup, as well as to analyze various rollback scenarios and switch to the backup site in case of unsuccessful deployment.

      And why do we need it? .. About this under the cut.  And about how the Uptime day conference will be useful for you. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  For 10+ years of its existence, ITSumma has participated in 100 IT-related conferences.  And this is undoubtedly a good opportunity to gain knowledge (the search for clients is, rather, for exhibitions).  In essence, the purpose of the work of the organizers is to provide a platform where you can get this new knowledge and establish new contacts. <br><br>  What is the fundamental difference <a href="https://uptime.community/">Uptime day</a> from other conferences?  - We are aimed not at the ‚Äúspeaker-listener‚Äù format, but at the dialogue format.  All our speakers not only answer questions after the report, but are always ready to communicate in one-to-one mode on the sidelines at the end of a speech.  In fact, it turns out a kind of personal consultation with experts.  And their experience, their bumps filled in the practical process, the speakers, as they say, are carried to the masses - in general and individually.  Receiving feedback and information about the same stuffed cones from the participants.  Knowledge interchange  In free mode: there is no entry for money.  The main currency is knowledge.  And the desire to buy them. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zq/sb/qk/zqsbqkqcxo83l8o3irvolbfkxtg.jpeg"><br><br>  Altruism?  (maybe) But it's not about him.  My belief is that there should be a platform where any IT specialist can be a full participant in the process, regardless of the current corporate status.  And one more my conviction that the IT community cannot function productively in a situation of scarce access to real practices. <br><br>  So what are we talking about?  - About the conference, where people come for knowledge, case studies, honest dialogue about how we change the world.  Does it change after our ideas?  - Let's talk about this at <a href="https://uptime.community/ru/uptimeday-4">Uptime day 4</a> . <br><br>  We devoted the first conference to monitoring high-load sites: as they say, prevention is simpler (and cheaper) than cured. <br><br>  The second theme is fatal accidents in the infrastructure: who does not like honest stories about packs? <br><br>  At the third, they talked about the practice of working with complex infrastructures: they are not the only ones that live. <br><br>  And the fourth topic is reservations.  Well, simply because the gaps in this area are too expensive in 2019: if you have dropped something, it is not about which recovery path to choose;  on this thought you have already lost - and lost N thousands of rubles and X hundreds (well, if hundreds) of clients.  It's about how to make the recovery process as quick as possible, hassle-free, flexible and efficient. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ec/py/zi/ecpyzip_agnneodf1gi7hxrogtc.jpeg"><br><br>  They will tell about their experience: <br><br>  <a href="https://mcs.mail.ru/">Mail.ru cloud solutions</a> is the topic of the report ‚ÄúHow a fail-safe web architecture is implemented in Mail.Ru Cloud Solutions‚Äù; <br>  <a href="https://tech.badoo.com/ru/">Badoo</a> - the theme of the report "Nginx + Keepalived: how to reliably give 200k photos per second"; <br>  <a href="https://qrator.net/ru">Qrator</a> - the topic of the report ‚ÄúConstruction and operation of fault-tolerant <br>  anycast networks; <br>  <a href="https://www.bitrix24.ru/">Bitrix.24</a> - the topic of the report ‚ÄúQuickly raised is not considered fallen‚Äù; <br>  <a href="https://admindivision.ru/">AdminDivision</a> is the topic of the report ‚ÄúFailover: perfectionism and laziness are ruining us‚Äù; <br>  <a href="http://www.itsumma.ru/">ITSumma</a> is the topic of the report ‚ÄúReservations at K8s‚Äù. <br><br>  And yes - taking the opportunity, I invite you to become participants of the <a href="https://uptime.community/ru/uptimeday-4">Uptime day 4</a> conference.  As they say in one well-known social network, "it is free and always will be free."  But the knowledge of members of the Uptime community is invaluable. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/cx/vd/68/cxvd68nxhui-t_-fd-vmzteear8.jpeg"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/444678/">https://habr.com/ru/post/444678/</a></p>
