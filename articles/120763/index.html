  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Olympiad programming as an art</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  "Nowadays it is considered generally accepted, <br>  that of all things concerning art one way or another, <br>  nothing can be considered generally accepted " <br>  Theodore Adorno <br><br>  It all started with how one person tried to figure out the solution to the contest challenge that was currently taking place.  The task was very simple, it was obvious to everyone that this person would not occupy a good place, would not get a T-shirt, etc.  But nevertheless, none of the 5000+ members of the community gave any clues (or at least from 30+ people who saw this and knew the answer).  To me, such a result has long seemed logical and I tried to explain it in two words.  Now try a little more detail.  I apologize in advance to people who invest in this concept is not what I am.  I just wanted to give my opinion. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  First, a little theory from Wikipedia: <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B8%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5">Programming</a> , <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B8%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5">Programming</a> <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259E%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B5_%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B8%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5">Olympiad</a> , <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2598%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D1%2583%25D1%2581%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE">Art</a> .  Please note that the last article states ‚ÄúThe concept of art is extremely broad - it can manifest itself as an extremely developed skill in a particular area‚Äù. <br><br>  I always thought that programming is a kind of art.  There is a narrow area - a class of programming olympiad tasks.  The ability to quickly and accurately solve problems similar to sports, and often Olympiad programming is called sports, because here, as in sports, you first train for several years, then you play once, you <s>merge everything and you</s> score some results and <s>rejoice in programming</s> .  But on the other hand, sport is not very creative.  Usually strategies are not drawn up by the main participants and they do not shine with originality and beauty.  But programming is not so.

      No one will argue that poetry is an art.  But what is poetry?  Poems are the ability to put your thoughts in a clear framework of rhythm and rhyme, style and vocabulary.  There are many limitations that do not just give you what you want.  Why are they?  This adds to the verse of beauty and grace, it shows that the author has invested efforts to express his thoughts in this way, respectively, these thoughts were carefully thought out by the author, ground and received a material form in the form of a verse.  In addition, the language of thought is very different from almost all languages ‚Äã‚Äãof the world, whether it is the language of words, the language of images, the language of sounds, or the language of architecture. <br><br>  Similarly, the situation is with programming.  If the author wants to write a verse, he needs to submit a thought, and then create a verse expressing this thought.  In order to solve a problem, you first need to come up with a solution, and then consistently turn it into an algorithm, then into a program in a programming language.  But the programming language does not fit well with the language of thoughts, therefore, we must find a way to express our thoughts through this language.  And we are improving this skill year after year by creating more and more perfect works of art. <br><br>  Here you see a board in the city house of creativity.  ‚ÄúThe exhibition of children's drawings‚Äù is written in even letters on top of the blackboard, and under the inscription various episodes from children's life are no longer so evenly depicted.  Try to answer - is this art?  My answer is yes, definitely.  These children have found their way to communicate with the world, to show them their thoughts.  Let them be very primitive and roughly depicted (although, it happens in different ways, some children are capable of masterpieces that have never dreamed of adult artists), but this is art.  Perhaps someday, one of these children will paint legendary paintings, and people from all over the world will come to see them.  It all starts small. <br><br>  I would like sites like <a href="http://topcoder.com/tc">Topcoder</a> or <a href="http://codeforces.ru/">Codeforces to</a> be a kind of programming art clubs (like, for example, <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2591%25D1%2583%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D0%25BB%25D1%258F%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5">people</a> ) in which people communicate, share secrets, create together, help newbies, but never give out other people's thoughts for their own. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/120763/">https://habr.com/ru/post/120763/</a></p>
