Every day, 19 sources are automatically monitored and an average of 10‚Äì15 relevant news is gathered from which, the best are subsequently selected and announcements are prepared for digest. <br>  The readers of the digest make a tangible contribution; not a single issue passes without the news they have added. <br>  In the half year that has passed since the weekly digest of news about the python programming language and nearby technologies has ceased to be published in Habr√©, we have got a permanent audience of readers, made friends with the leading Russian-language python sites, found and learned to handle new sources of information about python in the network, became Constantly publish in the popular public on this topic in contacts, translated and published interesting articles. <br><br>  Interested in details and figures, welcome under cat.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h1>  How to keep abreast of all the news. </h1><br><br>  The main purpose for which the digest was created is to create an aggregator of news and information, both on the python programming language and on branches or modules.  During the existence of the digest, approximately 5,235 materials were collected, 1,776 news were translated and published. <br><br>  Useful information was distributed among the sources as follows: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c2f/722/6f7/c2f7226f7b3542dc83b7cbacf8c89974.png"></div><br><br>  At the same time, ‚ÄúDifferent sources‚Äù are, for the most part, twitter and what guests sent us via a special form.  Social networks (Vkontaktiki, Google+) create noise, but as a source of useful news is almost useless. <br>  The result is that if you don‚Äôt want to fall behind the life boiling in the python community, you need to subscribe and read the key of twiiter accounts, read the r / Python top for a week, subscribe to two main mailings, and of course do not ignore Habra.  Django line aggregator based on the trends of requests to google on a given topic may be interesting for dzhangists and their sympathizers. <br><br><br><h1>  Year of interesting news and trends </h1><br><br>  During the time spent in searching news, reading articles and participating in public discussions (and this is already more than a year), it was impossible not to single out the news- <em>stars</em> and not catch some trends.  Below is a small analysis of the current situation and a selection of interesting articles that we appreciated during the year. <br><br>  The main trend is seen in the strong development of python in the direction of scientific computing and data analysis.  Far from the last place is the remarkable <a href="http://ipython.org/">IPython</a> project, which, with the support of powerful computational libraries <a href="http://pandas.pydata.org/">pandas</a> , <a href="http://www.numpy.org/">numpy</a> , <a href="https://scikits.appspot.com/scikits">SciKits,</a> allows <a href="https://scikits.appspot.com/scikits">you</a> to interactively conduct research and conveniently share the results and methods of research / computing.  This was noticed in JetBrains - in <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/JetBrains/blog/243831/">PyCharm 4</a> , support and debugging of IPython is improved.  Here are a few good articles about this that have been in the digest issues throughout the year: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://plot.ly/python/3d-plots-tutorial/">Building interactive 3D diagrams in IPython Notebook</a> Based on plotly service </li><li>  <a href="http://blog.cloudera.com/blog/2014/08/how-to-use-ipython-notebook-with-apache-spark/">Using IPython Notebook with Apache Spark.</a> Working through the PySpark module that opens up new scalability limits with Spark and Hadoop technologies. </li><li>  <a href="http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/soft-matter/trackpy-examples/blob/master/notebooks/custom-feature-detection.ipynb">Search for bubbles in foam photography.</a> We use a whole set of scientific modules and in addition to the task of searching for bubbles, the direction of foam movement is determined. </li><li>  <a href="http://tonysyu.github.io/ipython-jupyter-widgets-an-image-convolution-demo.html">IPython GUI (Jupyter) on the example of image convolution</a> Using a simple html slider to adjust the parameters of the image convolution algorithm in IPython </li></ul><br><br><h1>  Faster!  Above!  Stronger! </h1><br><br>  Another trend is concern about the performance of calculations and algorithms in general.  Here are some interesting approaches.  In addition to the above-mentioned modules, in which many numerical algorithms have already been implemented, for example, methods of converting code into machine code are used.  Here, the <a href="http://nuitka.net/">Nuitka</a> project shows itself remarkably <a href="http://nuitka.net/">and</a> pretends to the ability to assemble any python code into native one by converting it into similar c ++ code and then compiling it.  A slightly different approach in the <a href="http://cython.org/">Cython</a> project is that its idea is to compile a subset of the python language into code that can be conveniently used later as a plug-in.  Another approach is jit-compiling during execution in a special <a href="http://pypy.org/">PyPy</a> interpreter.  A version of pypy-stm using the Software Transactional Memory model got to the <a href="http://morepypy.blogspot.ru/2014/07/pypy-stm-first-interesting-release.html">point</a> where it can actually be used on projects with 2.7. A number of articles about these technologies and their application in practical tasks were really very interesting and even translated to Habr√©: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="http://project-trains.tumblr.com/post/102076598295/multiprocessing-pypy">Transferring the execution of a part of highly loaded code from CPython to PyPy</a> It is performed using the multiprocessing module with the path to the new interpreter.  Quite an interesting opportunity. </li><li>  <a href="http://pythonfasterway.uni.me/">We write faster code</a> A very curious set of performance tests for different syntax constructs of a language. </li><li>  <a href="http://www.machinalis.com/blog/making-the-case-for-jython/">When to choose Jython</a> A small overview and practical example of the advantages of using Jython when integrating with existing Java libraries </li><li>  <a href="https://www.codementor.io/python-tutorial/stack-overflow-martijn-pieters-python-optimization%3Futm_medium%3Dtwitter%26amp%3Butm_source%3Dtwitterfeed">Optimization in python and how they can touch</a> you. The code you write is optimized by the interpreter in various ways during execution.  Sometimes this can lead to side effects, some of which are covered in the article and video. </li><li>  <a href="http://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2014/05/09/why-python-is-slow/">Why python is slow: look under the hood</a> Review of bottlenecks and their causes in python </li><li>  <a href="http://honnibal.wordpress.com/2014/10/21/writing-c-in-cython/">Writing high-performance Cython code</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://www.crumpington.com/blog/2014/10-19-high-performance-python-extensions-part-1.html">High-performance extensions for python on C</a> In two articles, the author understands how to speed up the performance of complex calculations by moving them into an extension written in a lower-level language.

Essentially, optimization is reduced to finding the best solution to a problem by testing various solutions and comparing them with each other for quality assessment.  Usually optimization is used in cases when the number of solutions is too large and it is impossible to sort them all. </li></ul><br><br><h1>  2.x vs 3.x </h1><br><br>  Since 2011, the battle of branches 2.x and 3.x continues.  On the one hand, almost all libraries have acceptable support for 3.x, on the other hand, developers are still not in a hurry to switch to the future branch.  This is facilitated by the extension of support for the 2.x branch until 2019, as well as backporting of features from the third branch. <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="http://python-notes.curiousefficiency.org/en/latest/python3/questions_and_answers.html">Why Python 3, not Python 2?</a>  A question that torments everyone.

This is evident in the composition of articles announced on PythonDigest.  Most of them are about the web or near it.  Here are just a few random articles: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/235419/">Django 1.7</a> The long-awaited release of django 1.7 has been released. </li><li>  <a href="http://asvetlov.blogspot.com/2014/10/flask_20.html">Why I do not like Flask</a> There is such a popular microframework: Flask.

Why almost, you ask?

A tutorial on Django is available for free. It was previously a paid tutorial for everyone.

So, since we were good boys and girls all year, we ask Grandfather Frost to separate pieces of the Russian-speaking python community to communicate and communicate even more;  for python2 fans to find a compromise with python3 fans;  to make <a href="http://kivy.org/">kivy</a> the number one platform for mobile apps;  to make pythondigest even more friends, help newbies and gurus to join together to develop the community in discussions and in creating new projects and continue to be a consolidating platform and an aggregator of fresh knowledge of Python.  Well and peace in the whole world just in case - suddenly it will turn out this time. <br><br>  Congratulations to all the upcoming New Year! <br><br>  <i>Many thanks to <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/owlman75/" class="user_link">owlman75</a> for co-authorship and illustration to the article.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/247067/">https://habr.com/ru/post/247067/</a></p>
