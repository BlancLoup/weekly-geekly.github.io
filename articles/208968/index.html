  <section class="page js-page"><h1>LED workplace lighting</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I read for a long time, I couldn‚Äôt decide what to write, what would be useful and interesting for others. <br>  And now, having once read the article <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/208318/">Home CNC</a> <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/vbifkol/" class="user_link">milling cutter of the</a> user <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/vbifkol/" class="user_link">vbifkol</a> , I decided - this is it! <br><br>  A year ago, when I was still a beginner and a greedy newbie, I decided that I could take something cheaper and trample me.  I bought one machine, produced in small batches by one person.  As a beginner machine, the machine was an acceptable choice.  But as they say, the miser pays twice.  Being a sociable person, he told friends to advertisers about a machine tool and immediately received the first trial order.  And then it began, it is not so, it is not so - there is no speed, the accuracy is not the same, the working field is ridiculous (33 by 43 centimeters).  Having rushed a little more than a year, it was decided to sell the machine and take the machine of industrial assembly.  If you are interested in what happened in the end, <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Since I am a humanist (a physicist by training), I began an active search by studying specialized forums.  The links to these forums are not intentionally indicated, if it is interesting, then I will publish the links.  Studying the forums - it came to an understanding of what I need - and what parameters need to be voiced by sellers. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

      So, the choice was limited to the following: <br>  1. the control of the CNC should be carried out by the DSP processor; <br>  2. The working field must be at least 90 to 60 cm, and the height of the workpiece at least 100mm; <br>  3. the spindle must be water-cooled, at least 1.5kW; <br>  4. the presence of the sensor tool for setting the height along the Z axis. <br><br>  Almost 2 weeks spent on correspondence with 3 sellers, in the process of conversation reducing the number of sellers and specifying all sorts of subtleties, including such as shipping, packing machine, availability of a guarantee and so on.  Due to the peculiarities of the rented premises and the lack of regularly transporting almost 200 kg, it was decided to take a desktop version of the machine (the desktop one is conditional, since the table was welded, the so-called bed). <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Characteristics of the selected machine</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><table><tbody><tr><td>  XYZ working area <br></td><td>  600 x 900 x 150 mm <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Clearance portal <br></td><td>  120 mm <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Accuracy <br></td><td>  0.1mm <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Repeatability <br></td><td>  0.05 mm <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Frame structure <br></td><td>  Cast iron casting <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Table structure <br></td><td>  T-slot reinforced <br><br></td></tr><tr><td>  XYZ Linear Motion <br></td><td>  Profile guide PMI in all axes <br></td></tr><tr><td>  XYZ axis drive <br></td><td>  Ball screw <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Maximum idle speed <br></td><td>  15 m / min <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Maximum working speed <br></td><td>  10 m / min <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Acceleration <br></td><td>  1200mm / sec2 <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Type of axle drive motors <br></td><td>  Stepper <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Motor driver <br></td><td>  Yako 2608 <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Spindle <br></td><td>  1.5kw, liquid cooled, 4 bearings <br><br></td></tr><tr><td>  Collet Type <br></td><td>  ER16 <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Maximum spindle speed <br></td><td>  24,000 rpm <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Inverter <br></td><td>  Delta <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Operating voltage <br></td><td>  AC220V / 50-60Hz <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Control code <br></td><td>  G - codes <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Computer interface <br></td><td>  USB 2.2 <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Software <br></td><td>  <strong>ArtCAM Express 2012 rus</strong> <br><br></td></tr><tr><td>  Control system <br></td><td>  DSP A11 (Digital Signal Processor) <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Machine size <br><br></td><td>  1300 x 1000 x 930 mm, 225 kg <br><br></td></tr><tr><td>  Packed machine size <br></td><td>  1450 x 1100 x 1100 mm, 270 kg <br><br></td></tr></tbody></table><br></div></div><br><br>  Having paid almost 200 thousand rubles through a bank transfer, he began nervously to expect a letter from the seller to receive the money.  3 days later I received the message "the machine was sent to the transport company, wait for the call."  When receiving time was spent 4 friends, the jeep of one of the friends was shot down - at the wrong time the pickup door was open. <br><br>  A week later, after reading the article about home cnc router, it was decided to finally do something useful for the house.  Being an active PC user, I was constantly concerned about the issue of workplace lighting.  A table lamp, equipped with an energy-saving lamp, gave too little light, and the lamp burned out with frightening regularity.  Changing a lamp at the price of 90 rubles 2-3 times a month turned out to be a very sad process. <br><br>  So, the implementation of the topic was a matter of decision. <br><br><h4>  The choice of material and design </h4><br>  I thought for a long time how to solve the issue of organizing the background lighting behind the monitor.  There was an option - to glue the LED tape on the back panel of the LCD monitor, but then this option was discarded: <br>  1. the tape heats up quite noticeably, and I decided that for the monitor such heating would not be good; <br>  2. The power supply for the LED strip will still hang on the table uncontrollably; <br>  3. there is a high-tech unit; <br>  4. P1-P2 in combination will look very impartial, and P3 did not give a reason to do so at all. <br><br>  As a material, it was decided to choose 10mm plywood.  Plywood is quite convenient material for processing on the CNC router, the price is very budget.  A plywood sheet was bought at the nearest hardware store for 450 rubles (1.5m x 1.5m) <br><br>  Electronics was purchased: <br>  1. 1 meter of LED tape (I don‚Äôt remember the name, it was just the brightest tape in the store) - 260 rubles; <br>  2. power supply 12 watts - 320 rubles; <br>  3. plug for connecting to the network - 25 rubles; <br>  4. meter of wire to connect the power supply to the mains 220V - 12 rubles. <br>  Total: 617 rubles. <br><br><h4>  Assembly process </h4><br>  Having spent a lot of time, following the principle of 7 times, 1 cut off, the necessary dimensions were chosen (looking ahead, I say, I still missed). <br>  The whole process of cutting parts for the stand took about 15 minutes.  Slightly less than 30% of the time was spent on fixing plywood on the desktop. <br><br><h5>  Stand details: </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9b8/019/79e/9b801979ef4c976ec09ca16d5a053478.jpg"><br><br>  So, I prepared, opened the tube of glue "Moment" and the process went: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d71/a38/75a/d71a3875ab95ecd6b70329a0b5005d18.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/339/f00/063/339f00063b40bd34546376d3d3db3d7a.jpg"><br><br>  After waiting an hour with deprive took off the clamp, and here it is, stand: <br>  back view <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b82/3df/0e7/b823df0e71734cd1fee9217878c21edb.jpg"><br>  she's in full face <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e30/82f/096/e3082f09644bee9963c62093c6fea1cf.jpg"><br><br>  Making sure that the glue grabbed and the halves of the supporting structure do not diverge, it was decided to glue the LED tape: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d78/06a/b3b/d7806ab3b456e737c1dec9c7a3908863.jpg"><br><br>  on one of the side racks was mounted power supply: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d73/3df/2b8/d733df2b8f71de0fb6975177613afc0e.jpg"><br><br>  Having completed the installation of LED strip, power supply and sockets, conducted a trial run of the structure: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1f0/bad/589/1f0bad5892d2af66186863c9d1300c96.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/21f/e26/d74/21fe26d74ad6ef407bc9739e768fe07b.jpg"><br>  (The camera made its decision, and the trick "floated away." The use of the wire was due to the fact that the complete 2-sided adhesive tape had very low adhesion to plywood, and when heated, the free end of the LED strip began to sag) <br><br>  Making sure that everything is normal, it was decided to install this design for permanent residence for the monitor: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/684/318/417/684318417240ddc10744156a11edfa82.jpg"><br><br>  The result is a day off, about 700 rubles of money and this is what happened at the exit: <br>  It was: <br>  1. my workplace without lighting: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/dbc/59d/c9d/dbc59dc9d22b895e87512478d8fec9d5.jpg"><br><br>  2. My workplace, with a desk lamp: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/96f/cbe/171/96fcbe171b0df8754933a1fd5a9728b1.jpg"><br><br>  3. My workplace with a desk lamp and a chandelier (controlled through a dimmer, so the background lighting is so dim): <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/dda/b13/f28/ddab13f281fa91a4017b601f90bfc4fd.jpg"><br><br>  It became: <br>  the backlight is on, the rest of the lighting in the room is off: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4c5/6aa/e7d/4c56aae7da2283e765f9d4c3d13463be.jpg"><br><br>  and general view of the workplace: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b2d/a71/2fc/b2da712fcfcca4ed57e9cde94ada1dc7.jpg"><br><br>  Conclusion.  There are always areas where the CNC router will be more in demand.  Next time I will be more closely put the stand to the monitor, so that standing at the table - the LED tape does not shine in the eyes of tall guests. <br>  I hope it was interesting. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/208968/">https://habr.com/ru/post/208968/</a></p>
