Inside the news is all about the shortcomings of Z Ultra and, of course, about its merits. <a name="habracut"></a>

In the photo above you can see how much the phone is larger than the iPhone 5. In the photo below you can also see how the phone <b>is the same</b> as the Samsung tablet. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/10e/500/4d1/10e5004d1ec494cd8bd6e357f9775297.png"><br><br>  The most interesting thing nowadays is that ‚Äúshovels‚Äù are commonly referred to as the middle segment in the mobile market: Samsung‚Äôs same Galaxy Mega doesn‚Äôt have the best stuffing and costs around 15 thousand rubles.  Sony went the other way.  Xperia Z Ultra is a premium class smartphone, with a powerful filling, excellent build, and of brand waterproof and dust protection. <br><br>  With a 2.2 GHz Snapdragon 800, the newest Adrena 330 and 2 GB of RAM, the Z Ultra shows some incredible numbers in AnTuTu. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/626/b1c/411/626b1c411c9aa66047cf46a3eb885177.png"><br><br>  Only Nvidia Shield, designed specifically for games and having on board a Tegra 4-chip, is gaining more. <br><br>  No glitches, no slowdowns in the Z Ultra can not be found, Android on it works like clockwork: everything is smooth, beautiful and "timely." <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/fc4/c58/208/fc4c58208bb2eb676d07f7de5cc98316.png"><br><br>  Inside installed proprietary shell from Sony.  I can not argue how good it is, but I have always enjoyed naked Android, so I can‚Äôt say anything positive about Xperia UX.  <i>Cool unlock screen, yes.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/ef1/0d1/901/ef10d1901e365c460e7cccbbc22a80cd.png"><br><br>  Returning to the topic of premium, I want to tell you about a completely non-primitive thing: the lack of a camera flash.  It‚Äôs not quite clear why Sony abandoned it, but I‚Äôm pretty sure that this was done in favor of the main flagship.  With the same characteristics and price of almost 20,000 rubles, the Z Ultra could easily bypass Z, which is not very good, because the target segment of the ‚Äúshovels‚Äù are completely different people.  Ah yes Sony, ah yes marketers! <br><br>  By the way, the camera itself in Z Ultra does not have superpowers: it usually takes off at the level of iPhone 4S. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/e1d/bca/ba9/e1dbcaba9c0474113867434645b2b960.png"><br><br>  But what the Xperia Z Ultra can boast of is the excellent viewing angles and, in general, the magnificent display, which is an order of magnitude more juicier and more qualitative than on a colleague without the prefix Ultra. <br><br>  With the protection of standards IP55 / 58, Z Ultra can be placed in water for 30 minutes no deeper than 1 meter.  Actually, from here and all the stubs in the phone.  But this whole story is painfully familiar to me in almost all the new products from Sony, so I would like to touch on the fact that the speakers are slightly quieter due to moisture protection than on the iPhone 5 and Xperia Z, so read this side of the phone carefully before buying it. . <br><br>  Returning to the design, I would like to criticize the proprietary button from Sony. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/bfc/864/be4/bfc864be409789745315867b7dae0db2.png"><br><br>  Honestly, she has long been tired of her: she has neither charm nor attractiveness.  Just corporate identity and all that.  I will take this opportunity and take my own words from the video review: <br><br><blockquote>  As always, Sony is not moving away from its proprietary button, which, in my opinion, is already a burden for it: as if the child had lied that he went to school, but he already said - therefore there is nowhere to retreat.  Here is Sony with its button as well. </blockquote><br><br>  Well, and probably the final touch in the shortcomings column.  Headphone input is on the side of the phone, not on top or bottom.  Whatever you say, and this is a minus, a large and obvious minus. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/8db/608/227/8db60822721dbe20edabc0111efb9666.png"><br><br>  In our country, the cost of Sony Xperia Z Ultra ranges around 25 thousand rubles, although the gray market offers a novelty from 20 thousand.  The official price generally makes you close your eyes and never open them again - 29990 rubles. <br><br>  Conclusion: Sony Xperia Z Ultra is good, very good.  The phone is nice to use, it is very thin (thinner than the iPhone 5).  To the touch, in appearance - candy.  From here and a conclusion that in the absence of disgust "shovels" and desire to buy 2 in 1 (phone + a tablet) - Z Ultra is definitely the best that the market can offer at the moment. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/193344/">https://habr.com/ru/post/193344/</a></p>
