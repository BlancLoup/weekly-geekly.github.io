Consumer Trends and Insights From Around the World.">trendwatching.com</a> , February-March 2007</em> Idiotic name, cool trend.  Traysyumery - experienced consumers.  They react vividly to many social and technological changes, applying them in their consumption practices.  We have come up with the following definition for traysyumerov: Tricyumers: consumers free from the shackles of conventions and deficits, who are immune to most forms of advertising.  Traysyumery have full access to information, reviews, criticism, opinions;  they are the "testers" of new household appliances, devices, new services, they "try" new tastes, first get to new places, get acquainted with new authors, artists.  Interestingly, everything new is interesting, everything new, they do their ‚Äúwork‚Äù as people who have outgrown mass consumption as a whole. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      Why do more and more consumers turn into trans-curators?  Here are some factors.  Living in a world of abundance means that there is still a lot of everything around that you can try.  And there is nothing wrong with the fact that millions of people from <a href="http://www.trendwatching.com/trends/GENERATION_C.htm">generation C (obsession)</a> add to this heap even more original ‚Äúproducts‚Äù, opinions, grouped in groups.  At the same time, the division into groups now stands at the forefront, since today in a consumer society the main thing is to stand out, and not to be like everyone else.  Which, in turn, leads to the need to check all the authoritative opinions expressed "on themselves".  In the luggage of experienced consumers - a lot of impressions already received.  And they know that in the future they will be even more.  Therefore, it is easier for them to cope with the disappointment that may follow the ‚Äúapprobation‚Äù <nobr>of something</nobr> unknown.  For example, if the weekend spent on an exciting trip was spoiled by bad weather, the realization that there will be seven more such trips in the coming year will make this little misfortune even less.  Today, consumers earn as much as never before.  But that‚Äôs not all: many of the goods and services required for testing with consumer curators are now amazingly available.  For example, flights with Asia Air, EasyJet and Virgin Air, the prices of which are more than affordable.  The list can be continued.  Navigation, giving almost unlimited freedom.  With Garmin or TomTom on hand, exploring new places, routes, areas is not so risky.  In 2005‚Äì2006, sales of personal navigation devices doubled in the United States and Europe, reaching 10 million units.  And the ever-increasing availability of GPS and the integration of this system with the Internet will make trouble-free orientation on the terrain a pretext for ordinary users.  We must not forget about the parallel trend, trans-consumerism (from the English. Transient Consumerism, "temporary consumption").  Representatives of this trend ‚Äî trans-consumers who deny consistency to consumers ‚Äî prefer to rent.  And the global market offers them more and more - any product for trial, temporary use of anything - from a supercar to a luxurious handbag - and all this costs a penny compared to the cost of ownership. <br><br>  Trend researcher Christina Driesa said the following: ‚ÄúA sample of everything new is a decadent alternative to ownership and constancy.  Nothing stops us.  Ball rules experiment.  We are obsessed with new experiences, especially those that we get for the first time.  Our feelings have been dulled: for many, everything has become too simple and boring.  We constantly ask "What's new?".  The first experience can also be repeated - try truffles for the first time in your life, and you will learn a new taste, and then taste the first truffles of the season, and you will know the connoisseur‚Äôs pleasure. ‚Äù <br><br>  We note a recently seen company working for trannyumer: <strong><a href="http://www.fractionallife.com/"><strong>Fractional</strong> <strong>Life</strong></a></strong> (UK).  The list of categories on her site looks like a list of expensive pleasures.  There are expensive wines, racehorses, classic cars, helicopters, etc.  All this can be obtained in temporary possession.  <strong>Quality is the dictator in the world of producers.</strong>  Today, even TVs and irons sold on WalMart under unknown brands work perfectly.  Another incentive to try <nobr>something</nobr> unknown.  And be less loyal to one brand or another.  According to a study conducted in 2006 by JD Power and Associates, only 26 percent of buyers agree to purchase a digital camera of the same brand as the one they already have.  In 2005, this decision was made by 35 percent of respondents. <br><br>  ‚ÄúPrice and image quality remain key factors in deciding whether to purchase a particular camera, and nuances such as additional functions, features and brand are no longer so important for consumers,‚Äù said Steve Kirkeby, executive director for telecommunications and technology research. JD Power and Associates.  - In an increasingly complete equality of goods, manufacturers are obliged to listen to the voice of customers and respond to them if they want to strengthen their loyalty to their brands and increase their level of satisfaction.  <a href="http://www.trendwatching.com/trends/2007top5.htm">The tyranny of transparency</a> is another ally of the transumer.  Reviews about everything that you can think of, available, anytime, eliminate the risk of buying "the cat in the bag." <br><br>  First-hand reviews and first-hand information will become even more relevant: there <a href="http://www.internetworldstats.com/stats.htm">are now</a> over 1 billion people <a href="http://www.internetworldstats.com/stats.htm">online</a> , and the army of reviewers is almost innumerable.  Think about it: a month <strong><a href="http://www.tripadvisor.com/"><strong>TripAdvisor</strong></a></strong> website <strong><a href="http://www.tripadvisor.com/"><strong>.</strong></a></strong>  <strong><a href="http://www.tripadvisor.com/"><strong>com</strong></a></strong> (on which ordinary tourists and travelers publish reviews) is visited by over 20 million people, the number of registered users of the site is 4.3 million, in the TripAdvisor.com database there are more than 7 million reviews and opinions, which deal with 23,000 cities and 175,000 hotels, not to mention the 460,000 photos of 35,000 hotels.  In the future, the reviews will become multimedia, will be available in real time, and, thanks to a complex profile scheme, will become more reliable.  We develop the theme of disappointment: the system of consumer relations with the consumer (consumer to consumer, C2C) is already taking place.  eBay, classifieds (classifieds) are all parts of a system within which a trader can easily get rid of what they no longer need.  Daniel Nissanoff, author of <a href="http://www.auctionculture.com/">FutureShop</a> , says: ‚Äú <nobr>Someone</nobr> shared an interesting observation with me: with the growth of eBay, people started to buy more musical instruments, especially guitars, because they are no longer concerned that they can choose the wrong tool, and torment him further.  The principle of the auction gives consumers an advantage: they can afford more good things, because their price is reduced.  Consumers know that the residual value will not go anywhere, there is always a way out, and if they make a mistake, it can be easily fixed. ‚Äù  (Source: Interview with Daniel Nissanof, taken by Tom Peters.) Traditional advertising is trusted exactly the same way as a certain president, who has a couple of years left before his resignation.  According to a study conducted by Forrester, only 13% of consumers in the US admit that they buy goods when they see / hear their advertisements, and only 6% believe that true facts are voiced in advertising.  Therefore, the provision of a product for use (full or limited) to potential buyers - traivering (tryvertising, try. (Ad) vertising) - becomes a new kind of promotion.  A couple of years ago, when describing the trend of <a href="http://www.trendwatching.com/trends/TRYVERTISING.htm">Treyvertizing</a> , we noted the following: ‚ÄúThere are no more‚Äú relationships ‚Äù.  There is only a cold-blooded, prudent, demanding consumer, and modest producers.  Therefore, presenting your product, giving people a chance to try it is a civilized and effective way to show respect. ‚Äù  There is nothing surprising in the fact that today they are supported by a whole infrastructure: iTunes offers <nobr>30-second</nobr> fragments of songs, and a number of companies provide product placement services - in this case, distribution of goods for sample among representatives of the target audience.  Travertizing works especially well where the target audience is naturally grouped together: in waiting rooms, rest rooms, offices, etc.  So far, there are few companies offering sample placement services in such places.  Among them are <strong><a href="http://www.brandconnections.com/"><strong>Brand</strong> <strong>Connections</strong></a></strong> , which offers a product for destinations designed for vacationers.  Accordingly, Brand Connections operates at resorts.  They describe the advantages and meaning of their services in the following way: ‚ÄúGive potential buyers their product when they can really use it.  Start the campaign from the first day of vacation - so they will have about 7 days to get used to this product. ‚Äù  Brand Connections customers include Absolut, Colgate-Palmolive, Kraft Foods and the Unilever Group.  What's next?  Is it tripping in airplanes, trains, rental cars?  Another example is <strong><a href="http://www.premierbags.com/"><strong>Premier Bags</strong></a></strong> .  This company delivers luxury bags filled with expensive goods (from Prada spirits to Ghirardelli chocolate) to Continental Airlines first-class cabin lounges.  It should be noted, and vans full of sneakers Nike - <strong><a href="http://www.bowerman.com"><strong>Nike</strong> <strong>Trial</strong> <strong>Vans</strong></a></strong> .  The action takes place in the UK, Ireland, France, Italy and Spain.  1000 pairs of sports shoes are offered for free.  Vans appear where people really run - from amateur marathons to parks with treadmills.  Working only with the target audience is one of the main elements of travertizing.  Other examples of promotions held by brand owners include diaper changing booths and toilets.  First: Turkish diaper manufacturer <strong><a href="http://www.evybaby.com/02haberler/haber16.asp"><strong>Evy</strong> <strong>Baby</strong></a></strong> sets up booths for changing this important part of children's attire in large stores.  In addition to free diapers and changing tables, there are comfortable chairs in the booths in which mothers can feed their children.  Second: the well-known company Procter and Gamble, promoting its toilet paper Charmin, installed dry closets in Time Square in <nobr>New York</nobr> .  The action was held under the motto "Gift to <nobr>New York</nobr> from Charmin".  The result is almost 430,000 satisfied visitors.  <strong><a href="http://www.apple.com/retail/"><strong>Apple</strong> <strong>'s</strong></a></strong> <strong><a href="http://www.apple.com/retail/"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></a></strong>  <strong><a href="http://www.apple.com/retail/"><strong>retail</strong> <strong>stores</strong></a></strong> - Apple's retail stores - worth mentioning separately.  Here the possibilities to test equipment are almost endless.  In the last quarter of 2006, sales revenue in these stores reached $ 1.1 billion.  For three months, nearly 28 million traysyumer visited 170 stores - it is 13,000 people a week.  The virtual world is even ahead of the real world, because the network testing is much easier.  A typical online product for TroySyumer - avatars, full and full-featured.  With such an <nobr>alter-ego</nobr> in the digital universe, consumers can try and try on a lot.  Notable developers of three-dimensional avatars - <strong><a href="http://www.myvirtualmodel.com/"><strong>My Virtual Model</strong></a></strong> and <strong><a href="http://www.gizmoz.com/"><strong>Gizmoz</strong></a></strong> .  The first is already working on brands like Sears, Land's End, H &amp; M, Speedo and Adidas.  An avatar is based on Adobe Flash, one photo of a real person and a sample of his / her voice are enough to create it.  Does such a development for traysyumerov pay off?  According to the My Virtual Model, customers using 3D avatars buy more, spend more, and return less.  The result is revenue growth, lower transportation costs.  The next step is the creation of three-dimensional analogs of <em>everything</em> , and not just people.  This will be a huge playground for traders.  Follow the progress of <strong><a href="http://sketchup.google.com/"><strong>Google</strong> <strong>SketchUp</strong></a></strong> . <h2>  Development </h2>  So ... Not every consumer will become a three-timemer.  And not everyone will try every time <nobr>something</nobr> new.  The development of a counter-trend is inevitable - it will be based on fatigue from abundant choices and lack of time.  However, it is obvious that more and more people will search and find new ways of consumption in 2007, 2008, 2009 and the following years.  Result?  More opportunities to launch new, interesting, intriguing products, both in individual niches and in the mass market.  Popularization and distribution of reyvertizinga (by the way, at the moment there is no highly specialized agency in the world that offers organization of travertizing shares).  "Virtualization" of everything and everything, for trying out virtual avatars of real people in the virtual world.  The emergence of hundreds and thousands of specialized review sites, filled with consumers for consumers. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/31187/">https://habr.com/ru/post/31187/</a></p>
