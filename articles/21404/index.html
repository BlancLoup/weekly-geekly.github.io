The cigarette in the chin-supporting hand smolders evenly, serving as a supplier of fresh smoke to the atmosphere of the little room. <br><br>  I was always amazed at his ability ... To fall into a kind of stasis, like Robert Sheckley ... It seems to be sitting, but there are no signs of life.  The clock is coming.  And he still sits, his eyes fixed on the flickering screen. <br><br>  - Kontseptuaaaalno ....- pulls the modern hero Robert and leans back in his chair.

      - You know, I have to pass this project by Thursday ... My friend ... I need fresh ideas, you know?  - his gaze never left the flat panel. <br><br>  I gently twisted my brush, my knee itched horribly, but the iron still thundered.  How frightening that sound is.  Metal Rattle.  How old are these chains?  All eaten away by rust.  I have been tormented by this guess for a long time ... It seems that I am not the first here ... <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  - How not cool, but you have to strain yourself.  There is such a thing ... I guess that your internal luggage is too small for one hundred percent return ... And we, accordingly, work on it as we can.  But understand.  I need your participation too.  You resist, although you know that it will still be the way I want it.  You do not read books, close your eyes to interesting films, try to cover your ears while listening to the right music.  You see, it is completely in your interests ...- he sweetly reached out and extinguished a cigarette. <br><br>  I rested my forehead against the wall and wept. <br><br>  - Noah, this will not help.  We need to work as a coordinated mechanism.  You are a generator, I am a visualizer.  Creator in other words. <br><br>  He constantly tells me that.  As if I agree and start to cooperate.  How terrible everything hurts.  Chains rubbed. <br><br>  ‚ÄúWell, well ... Slowly, we will begin, sir,‚Äù he rose from his chair, rubbed his stiff legs, and headed for another room. <br><br>  Lord, what to expect today?  What will come up with this maniac? <br><br>  In an attempt to free myself, I begin to frantically twitch.  Everything is even.  The chains are adjusted just in size ... Once again I look around the space around me.  Nothing that could help me.  I have already thought about gnawing off the chained parts of the body ... But I will remain without legs and arms ... Such prospects obviously do not suit me.  And the only thing that remains is just to wait. <br><br>  The bespectacled sadist never tries to wait, but today it is clearly prolonged ... And then a wave of horror pours over me.  I am impatient.  I myself sit and wait for him.  Yes, and with impatience ... <br><br>  I fell exhausted to the floor, rumbling with chains to the whole apartment. <br><br>  ‚ÄúMicrosoft is defeated, the rest will surrender themselves,‚Äù a voice from the kitchen calmly heard. <br><br>  The young man gently shaken the contents of the tube. <br><br>  - Yes, just what we need!  - picking up the tray, he headed for the workroom. <br><br>  - So, well, let's start ... Get up ... Yeah, like that.  Look here, - he helped me up and drew to the screen, - You see, you need something industrial-dark and to be remembered.  More gray tones.  Also think about the logo ... You are familiar with the theme and philosophy of the object of development ... <br><br>  He put me on a chair and, pushing another, sat opposite. <br><br>  - We have two ways.  The first - you are now eating this sugar, - he showed me a piece of refined soaked with some substance.  - This is with your unconditional consent of course. <br><br>  Anger ... No ... Hate, tearing me to pieces.  Again this bastard feeds me with some kind of psychotropic rubbish ... I don't want ... I won't.  I'm tired‚Ä¶ <br><br>  He sees it on my face. <br><br>  - Taaaaks ... As I understand it, you need to get acquainted with the second ... - bespectacled methodically shook some kind of test tube. <br><br>  It bears the inscription - "2,5-dimethoxy-4-bromoamphetamine + d-lysergic acid diethylamide + Franz Kafka". <br><br>  "I hate Kafka ... Too much nagging a lot ..." - flashes through my head. <br><br>  ‚ÄúSo, if you refuse sugar, I take this mortar, this little boy here ...‚Äù he demonstratively raises a green insulin syringe, ‚Äúand as a result, I smear you.‚Äù  And believe it, where more serious sugar. <br><br>  He smiled playfully. <br><br>  - Well?  - asks my create. <br><br>  ‚ÄúGive me sugar here,‚Äù I said. <br><br>  We spend the next hour in silence.  Outside the window it is drizzling light rain.  I jerk my foot to the beat. <br><br>  And at some point I understand that everything around us begins to tremble, naturally so.  That's about to burst. <br><br>  The visualizer gets up.  Noticed a change.  Draws me a tape recorder, a stack of sheets and a small, stupid pencil.  Cut the louder Aphex'a Twin'a. <br><br>  - Well, go ahead!  - only he says, going out the door. <br><br>  Somewhere around an hour everything accelerates.  Stronger and stronger than the movement of the surrounding space. <br><br>  And then ... A bright flash illuminates the room ... Flying in some sort of dull space.  I see the castle.  Cabinet  Dark pools.  White snow.  Gray buildings. <br><br>  A whole bunch, at first glance, nothing unrelated things.  But here the flow breaks through some kind of sharp semantic arrow and everything falls into place ... Now everything is clear ... <br><br>  Then I see a spectacle.  He flies to meet me.  Squeezes a lub ... Flight obviously gives him pleasure.  Well, well ... Let's not fold ... He hurt himself in the dust ... <br><br><br>  I woke up on the floor in the big room.  He corrected his glasses, then sat down.  Looked around.  And ... smiled. <br><br>  - There is a contact!  I have an idea!  There is!  THERE IS!  - I heard my joyful voice. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/21404/">https://habr.com/ru/post/21404/</a></p>
