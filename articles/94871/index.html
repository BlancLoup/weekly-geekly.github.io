So let's not deviate from the rules. These headphones are presented in a box with an interesting design, which immediately attracts attention and can not but like it.

Design: semi-open monitor dynamic, which allows you to completely close the ear while listening, and consequently, it provides a complete immersion in the sound.  The ear cushions are very soft and pleasant to the touch, the pressure on the head is small, so no discomfort, even for a long time listening, was found. <br>  One of the features of the Axelvox HD242 is a self-adjusting headband.  Two soft adjustable "ears" are under the rim of the headphones, which gives you a very easy adjustment of the size, or rather the design itself adjusts to the head.  For convenience, these ‚Äúears‚Äù can be made either closer to the center of the head, or closer to the ears. <br>  Also, what distinguishes these headphones from hundreds of others is the removable speaker wire.  On the left earpiece is a 3.5mm jack, to which you can connect a wire, 3 meters long, with a 3.5mm jack, or, 1 meter long, but with a 6.3mm jack.  Also, these 2 cables can be connected and get a 4-meter wire with 6.3 mm at the end.  All jackets are gold plated, which looks beautiful, and in practice it is better than any others. <br><br><h4>  Sound </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/760/17b/901/76017b90125f3d55f2af076fa30982f3.jpg"><br><br>  Of course, the most important thing in headphones is not design, but still sound.  About him now and tell you.  High-quality sound in these headphones provide neodymium magnets in the speakers. <br>  The sound is very soft and clear.  The bass is tapped very well, not loud and not quiet.  As befits the headphones of this class, the audibility is excellent, the sound is clear, no noise, the acoustic channel is precisely tuned.  In general, because  This monitor headphones, the sound they transmit without distortion, so you can hear more details, channel separation, etc., which is undoubtedly important when monitoring audio recordings. <br>  The impedance is 55-56 Ohm, which allows you to use these headphones to everyone without exception (and not only to professionals who can use 250 Ohm analogs) <br>  A half-open structure allows you to abstract from the outside world and listen to music, penetrate the sound, so that, for example, correct it.  Because  the noise isolation is still partial, the headphones will not be able to extinguish external noise in loud places, but in the apartment and even more so, in the studio, audibility in the headphones is excellent and no sound is heard from outside. <br>  Headphones Axelvox HD242 are good at studio recording, as well as when recording "live" sound, because  they are half-open, and therefore do not distort the sound in the recording.  In them, the ‚Äúleakage‚Äù of music to the outside is insignificant, and the sound is more spatial than that of models with fully enclosed cases. <br>  They will also be useful for DJs when processing music to clearly understand what is being listened to, what needs to be changed and corrected.  This is a very important function with which this model does an excellent job. <br><br><h4>  Price </h4><br>  As for the price issue, these monitor half-open headphones cost only 1300r.  Who knows - even ordinary liners are now being sold for the price.  So, the price hit the most, especially with this design and sound quality.  I think it would be great if all high-end headphones were in this price range, but for now this is only Axelvox.  If you need headphones for the house, then it is better to buy big good ‚Äúears‚Äù for the price than small earbuds that won't let you enjoy the sound.  And even more so - this is a great option for semi-professional sound engineers, who do not need expensive headphones from 7000, but they need high-quality sound. <br><br><h4>  Overall impression </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9e5/348/6ff/9e53486ff9bb1823a01ccf0e81584e13.jpg"><br><br>  As these headphones began to make a good impression, starting with the box, they ended up at the price.  In its price range, the Axelvox HD242 occupies the best niche of monitor headphones. <br>  They liked everything, and high-quality assembly, and well-developed design, and especially, of course, the fact that you do not need to constantly adjust the size of the bow, even if someone used them before you and arranged for themselves.  Headphones will always take the size of your head, this, I believe, is a very important quality that makes working with them much easier. <br>  In general, the Axelvox HD242 is an upscale, half-open headphone designed for monitoring, in which you can feel the sound as it was created, without any distortion and illusion, without increasing the bass.  You can hear what the author laid in the song, and not how they could and ‚Äúwanted‚Äù to reproduce the headphones. <br>  They will be useful and loved by everyone: from a novice music lover to a stagnant pro.  Beginners will love the self-adjusting rim size, while professionals and music lovers will enjoy the sound they can work even better with. <br><br><h5>  pros </h5><br>  + Design <br>  + Assembly + materials <br>  + Comfort <br>  + High quality sound <br>  + Equipment (2 wires + case) <br>  + Not pressing structure <br><br><h5>  Minuses </h5><br>  - Sometimes the wire is pulled out of the headphones. <br><br>  These ‚Äúears‚Äù can compete with venerable brands within sound devices, and now I don‚Äôt even dare to say who will win.  Because  The price-quality ratio of this model of Axelvox is so far the most acceptable of those that can be found on the market of headphones, and especially in Russia. <br><br>  Especially for <a href="http://www.habrahabr.ru/">Habrahabr</a> and <a href="http://www.cyberstyle.ru/">CyberStyle.ru</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/94871/">https://habr.com/ru/post/94871/</a></p>
