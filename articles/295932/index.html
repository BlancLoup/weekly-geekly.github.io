      ‚ÄúSeveral years ago there was such a popular topic that this is not Russia - a raw materials appendage of the West, and the West is a technological appendage of Russia.  She had the right to exist in a period of high oil prices.  But now, it seems to me, it is obvious to everyone that the advanced colonialists with glass beads will still take the gold from the Indians, ‚Äùreasons Stanislav Protasov. <br><br>  He cites data from <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/PricewaterhouseCoopers">PwC</a> and <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A0%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D1%2587%25D1%2583%25D1%2580%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F">RVC</a> research: last year, the Russian IT venture capital market was estimated at $ 400 million.  The same figure in Israel was $ 3.5 billion. <br><br>  ‚ÄúTherefore, we definitely need to develop innovation.  Of course, we are doing quite a little while, ‚ÄùMr. Protasov believes. <br><br>  His view of the situation in Konstantin Fokin: <br><blockquote>  When we talk about investment activity, we talk about it with some strain: this is important, necessary, this is a state task.  We forget a simple thing - it is a very natural kind of activity for a person, for a company for two reasons.  The first is extremely interesting.  The second is for those who do it successfully and professionally, it is extremely beneficial.  [Therefore], as an independent task, the development of innovation is practically non-existent.  Rather, success, the activity of such activities within the economy is an indicator of its health.  And in a healthy economy, the task of the state is not to develop innovation, [and vice versa] - to limit it.  Healthy is, above all, a competitive [economy]. </blockquote><br>  ‚ÄúFrom my point of view, the state limiting the growth of IT startups is evil.  It should stimulate their growth, ‚ÄùMr. Protasov objects. <br><br>  ‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs just here that the state and its restrictions interfere rather than help.  [For example,] exporting finished products from Russia is a whole story.  We have a lot of controlling things, ‚Äùhe complains. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThese difficulties are beyond the most innovative sphere: the standard of living, the image of the country, infrastructure, borders,‚Äù agrees Mr. Fokin. <br><br>  ‚ÄúState-owned venture capital companies are regulated by legislation that does not have many basic principles.  For example, in our legislation there is no concept of ‚Äúacceptable risk‚Äù.  Imagine: a state-owned venture capital company is investing in a startup.  Startup burns out.  From the point of view of regulators, she squandered money, ‚Äùcontinues Stanislav Protasov. <br><br>  From the arguments of Konstantin Fokin, it follows that in the case of a healthy economy, the role of the state comes down to curbing the ‚Äúappetites‚Äù of business.  After all, the development of an innovation market, like any other, should not be carried out to the detriment of other industries and ecosystems.  He believes that in Russia the economy is still unhealthy: <br><blockquote>  Institutions that started working 5-7 years ago can launch many processes, but cannot finish.  It was assumed that the fact that they will start - technoparks, funding startups - will give impetus and then it will pick up the market.  The market does not pick up: there is no competition in most areas, there is no understanding. </blockquote><br>  ‚ÄúThey built a sandbox for startups - they played there.  The sandboxes got out abroad, and there it was empty, ‚Äùagrees Dan Medovnikov, director of the Institute of Innovation Management, National Research University Higher School of Economics. <br><br>  ‚ÄúWe have missed the core of any innovation process - the main player.  The main player is an innovative entrepreneur.  Entrepreneurship in our country has not gained a critical mass.  Not even innovative.  But a successful entrepreneur is always innovative.  A person wants to change the world, so he becomes an entrepreneur, ‚Äùhe continues. <br><br>  ‚ÄúAny technology company that is trying to make some kind of innovation, at least in the field of IT, should be globally oriented.  The Russian IT market is 1.5% -2% of the world.  Limiting yourself to 1.5% -2%, and then suffering from the fact that in these 1.5% -2%, relatively speaking, Gazprom and Sberbank, is just silly, ‚ÄùMr. Protasov believes. <br><br>  According to Medovnikov, the existing business development institutions, created by analogy with Western models, are not effective in Russia.  He believes that one of the reasons is the absence of a full-fledged analogue of Silicon Valley in our country. <br><br>  He also gave another reason: <br><blockquote>  Those entrepreneurs, or rather their small layer, which appeared in the early 90s and grew up without any institutions [accelerators], have technology businesses for billions, and even sometimes tens of billions of rubles.  I think we lost them in our innovation policy.  They are the salt of the Russian land, and we should work with them more actively. </blockquote><br>  ‚ÄúDevelopment institutes create the illusion that [in the industry] a lot is happening.  If they leave, tomorrow it will turn out that the king is almost naked.  The economy itself outside of development institutions produces little, ‚Äùnotes Mr. Fokin.  In his opinion, one of the solutions to the problem is to close part of these institutions, as well as Skolkovo. <br><br>  ‚ÄúWhy do we have few entrepreneurs and startups?  Our country is still not very attractive for investments, and there is simply not enough money, ‚ÄùStanislav Protasov sums up. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/295932/">https://habr.com/ru/post/295932/</a></p>
