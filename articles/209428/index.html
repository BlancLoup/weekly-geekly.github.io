Thus, the company holds the title of the largest US patent holder for the 21st year in a row. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  IBM's 2013 patent portfolio includes a variety of inventions that will help the company hold leading positions in such areas as cognitive technology, cloud computing and big data analytics.  These inventions will also make it possible to move to a new stage in the development of cognitive systems, during which computers can learn, draw conclusions and interact with us in a more natural, personalized manner.

      ‚ÄúWe are proud to be recognized as the leader of the list of leading US rights holders, but the acquisition of a patent is just one of the criteria for innovation.  Equally important is the result that patented inventions bring when commercial and public organizations use them to solve various problems, ‚Äùcommented Bernie Meyerson, an honorary employee of IBM and vice president of innovation.  ‚ÄúMoreover, a wide range of patented solutions emphasizes the need to create a unified patent system that could equally support and promote innovation in all areas of technology.‚Äù <br><br>  The number of IBM patents obtained in 2013 exceeded the total number of patents obtained by Amazon, Google, EMC, HP, Intel, Oracle / SUN and Symantec.  More than 8,000 IBM inventors from 47 states in the United States and 41 other countries contributed to the creation of a record patent portfolio in 2013. <br><br>  The list of the top ten patent recipients * in the United States in 2013 is as follows: <br><br>  <i>1. IBM 6 809</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>2. Samsung 4 675</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>3. Canon 3 825</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>4. Sony 3,098</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>5. Microsoft 2 660</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>6. Panasonic 2 601</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>7. Toshiba 2,416</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>8. Hon Hai 2,279</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>9. Qualcomm 2 103</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>10. LG Electronics 1 947</i> <br><br>  * According to IFI CLAIMS Patent Services <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/50b/ee9/2f1/50bee92f13d7ad35e6313aa9acafcc23.png"><br><br>  The record number of patents obtained by IBM in 2013 includes inventions that significantly change the way technologies are used on the Reasonable Planet, as well as those that lay the foundation for a new era of cognitive systems: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ US Patent No. 8,510,296: Assessment of the accuracy and use of the type of lexical meaning.  This patented invention provides the IBM Watson supercomputer with the ability to more accurately assess the questions asked in natural language, as well as analyze potentially correct answers.  To accelerate the development of patented inventions, IBM created the Watson Group, a new business unit that will develop and commercially implement cloud cognitive technologies. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ US Patent No. 8,515,885: Neuromorphic and synaptropic spike neural network with synaptic connections, created during simulation.  This patented invention marks a breakthrough in the field of computing technologies that mimic the work of the human brain.  These technologies, in turn, will lay the foundation for the onset of a new era of cognitive systems through the joint design of hardware and software components.  As part of the pilot project SyNAPSE (Systems of Neuromorphic Adaptive Plastic Scalable Electronics), IBM is creating a chip architecture that will be able to mimic the performance of the human brain and, at the same time, surpass it in overall efficiency and performance. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ US Patent No. 8,422,686: Automated validation and use of a cryptographic key, as well as the placement and distribution of a security certificate.  This patented invention automates the life cycle of cryptographic keys used to encrypt and protect data ‚Äî both at the creation, deployment, and deletion stages ‚Äî and helps improve the security of applications in cloud environments. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ US Patent No. 8,352,953: Dynamic configuration of virtual machines.  This invention helps solve the ‚Äúnoisy neighbor‚Äù problem, which reduces the ability to access the online system and limits the performance of the cloud network when there is a sharp increase in demand for goods on websites such as online stores or online auctions. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ US Patent No. 8,387,065: Estimated calculation of the data set.  This patent describes a pattern of interaction with big data and analytics, in which a small amount or set of analyzed data is evaluated, sorted and roughly analyzed for major trends or sharply deviating values ‚Äã‚Äãin real time.  The concept is based on the initial paradoxical situation - the analysis of big data is not large in itself.  This method allows to improve the performance of data analysis, reduce the amount of resources spent by the processor, and is based on modern graph theory.  Being built into IBM POWER processors ‚Äî the chips that are part of IBM Watson and IBM Power Systems servers ‚Äî the approximate data set calculation technology allows for improved cryptogram decoding techniques, as well as error correction during data transfer. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ US Patent No. 8,423,339: Visual analysis of the protein folding process.  This patented invention describes a method for finding and visualizing similar protein folding patterns, which helps to understand the process of stacking the structure of proteins in general, and may lead to new significant discoveries in the field of pharmaceuticals. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ US Patent No. 8,572,274: Calculation of the load shedding during data transfer in the application.  This patent describes a technology that allows you to maintain an adequate load on the transmission of large data by dropping and reducing the data set, which as a result does not affect the accuracy of the results. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ US Patent No. 8,402,041: Comparative analysis of past and present dialogues in an electronic environment.  This proprietary invention uses big data analytics to establish relationships between past and current dialogues in an electronic environment (both social and business), highlighting similar characteristics and providing relevant results in real time. <br><br>  Other examples of IBM inventions that received patents in 2013 can be found at: <a href="http://ibm.co/1kr8i0y">ibm.co/1kr8i0y</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/209428/">https://habr.com/ru/post/209428/</a></p>
