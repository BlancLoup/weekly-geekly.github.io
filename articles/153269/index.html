Part 1</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Thanks to all who raised karma and allowed to start writing on Habr√©.  I hope you will be interested. <br>  Thank you for your interest in Mars - thanks to which my karma unexpectedly quickly grew to 20 units, allowing you to popiarit a new project. <br><br><h4>  Part one.  Introductory. </h4><br><br>  <b>Why do we need Habr and a little pathos</b> <br>  <b>Who are we</b> <br>  <b>And what‚Äôs the point of scientific popularization and space</b> + two presentations about us and a project <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  <b>Why do we need Habr and a little pathos</b> </h5>  . <br>  My friends and colleagues are starting a big project, in which a significant role is given to interactive technologies, robotics, remote control technologies, and the connection of a multitude of non-standard hardware and software solutions.  We have far-reaching plans, and we expect, as the project develops, to involve in the team cool programmers, system engineers, inventors and innovators - who are not impudent to think about such a future world as we would like it to be, considering, but not giving in to seeable insurmountable vicissitudes around the world, looking for and supporting those trends that are acceptable for the development of us and our children.  We believe that it depends on our activity and position what the future world will be, and not only on the current political, economic and social situation.  It was pathos))

      Here we want to talk about what we are doing and what we are going to do, what we would like to have in the project as an idea, but we have not yet understood how to implement it, test our hypotheses for strength, listen carefully to ideas and suggestions from the community - maybe , you have an idea that you could possibly check on our sites). <br><br><h5>  <b>Who are we?</b> </h5><br>  We are going around the Parks of Development company (there is no website yet), which was created this spring for this project.  Team members gathered from communities that have long been engaged in interactive developmental and educational technologies, starting with the <a href="http://www.sys-tema.ru/">school in Khavskaya</a> , which is well-known in certain circles, from the <a href="http://www.progressor.pro/">Progressor GC</a> community, from the informal environment of role-playing games, from the architectural community of <a href="http://monogroup.by/">MonoGroup</a> , engaged in futurological developments. <br>  We still have few people who would really be well versed in programming, coding, online gamification, etc. <br><br>  We conceived and began to realize how we see a cool and promising venture, which I will discuss in more detail in future posts. <br><br><h5>  <b>And what have the scientific popularization and space</b> </h5><br><br>  In short, we have come up with a new format of educational leisure or exciting education - <b>interactorium</b> .  It is a developing environment that models the future of the world in any of its aspects, combining online and offline components.  This is not a separate simulator, and not a completely virtual world, but a specially designed full-scale model.  We plan to launch a network of interaktoriums and development parks in different cities, with a way out from game modeling to practical development and the prospect of launching real start-up projects.  We are going to popularize the most advanced, promising developments and look even further into the future, show the young people the perspectives of scientific and technological development. <br><br>  Development parks - the initiator of the creation of interakorium, laboratories and educational sites around them.  Priority topics at the moment: aerospace, airborne transport development, city and settlement of the future, interactive education, health technologies.  It is precisely on these topics that the development of investoria is currently being developed.  More will be a separate post. <br><br><div class="slideshow"><iframe src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/14488987&amp;xid=25657,15700021,15700043,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700255,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhgA2fNNV3Zlz-qT-0x4q1MY5gHlGA" width="425" height="355" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><br><br>  Our first interaktorium is dedicated to <b>space research and space technologies</b> , and we are literally launching it now in the Space pavilion at the All-Russian Exhibition Center.  And since the interaktorium is dedicated to Mars, we have accumulated a certain amount of interesting facts and data about this planet, and we would also like to share it with those who are interested in it.) In the Mars-Tefo Interactionum: Expedition to the Future, we model bases on Mars in conditional year 2050.  This is a full-size base model, with models of the work of various station systems.  We start with three compartments - energy, scientific and command, in the wing of the pavilion Cosmos, <br><img src="http://mars-tefo.ru/Pictures_upload/%D0%BE%D1%82%D1%81%D0%B5%D0%BA%D0%B8.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  As the project develops, the number of compartments is planned to be increased to 36 in the dome of the Cosmos pavilion: <br><img src="http://mars-tefo.ru/Pictures_upload/%D0%9C%D0%A2%202014%20%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BD%D1%86%D0%B5%D0%BF%D1%82.jpg" alt="image"><br>  On the basis of such natural scenery, we will conduct tours and games for young people.
