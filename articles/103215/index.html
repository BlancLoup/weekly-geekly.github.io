Gregory will tell the story of how Microsoft came up with Agile practitioners at a time when they were called Lightweight, in the days before Agile Manifesto was created.  Gregory will share his thoughts on how Agile approaches affect people, the delivery of software, as well as the economic viability of implementing Agile.  This report is key and will open the Keynote Speakers scene. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <a href="http://spb.agiledays.ru/"><strong><em># 2 Rugby, Scrum and Teamwork.</em></strong></a>  <a href="http://spb.agiledays.ru/"><strong><em>Dmitry Lyer, Softline</em></strong></a> <a href="http://spb.agiledays.ru/"><br></a>  The second stage, mostly Russian-speaking, will be opened by the ‚Äúshow report‚Äù of Dima Lyer, Softline's technical director.  Everyone knows that Scrum is one of the most popular Agile methodologies and most know that the word Scrum came to us from rugby, but very few people know why this happened and how close Rugby is to Scrum- <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9e5/09c/24e/9e509c24e64172a4269c68a2a6c2f8ea.jpg" align="right">  framework  In this report, Dima will draw a clear parallel between the specific game situations in rugby and the project activities of the Scrum team.  After this report, you can understand why it still works. <br><br>  <a href="http://spb.agiledays.ru/"><strong><em># 3 How to sell Agile to the customer?</em></strong></a>  <a href="http://spb.agiledays.ru/"><strong><em>Askhat Urazbayev, ScrumTrek</em></strong></a> <a href="http://spb.agiledays.ru/"><br></a>  I think Askhat is not necessary.  I can only say that his report was a huge success in Yekaterinburg.  Suppose you want to work on Scrum.  However, Agile alone does not implement.  You need to convince the customer, the head and colleagues.  Every day with burning eyes, you tell them about Scrum and Agile, but the trouble is that at some point they may start to avoid you.  In this report, Askhat will reveal the secrets of selling Agile to the customer and all other interested parties. <br><br><img src="http://spb.agiledays.ru/img/david-hussman.jpg" align="left">  <a href="http://spb.agiledays.ru/"><strong><em># 4 Products and People, David Hussman, DevJam</em></strong></a> <a href="http://spb.agiledays.ru/"><br></a>  David is our second keynote speaker.  His experience is colossal: he worked in the field of software engineering, was engaged in programming, produced musical groups. <br>  This interesting mix greatly influenced his approach to delivering information to the audience.  David will talk about how in the pursuit of trying to make Orthodox Agile not forget why you are using it, and also how to shift the focus from creating a classy ‚Äúprocess from books‚Äù to the simple and effective achievement of your company's goals, strengthening its practices flexible development. <br><br>  <a href="http://spb.agiledays.ru/"><strong><em># 5 Scrum Master - who are you?</em></strong></a>  <a href="http://spb.agiledays.ru/"><strong><em>Roman Yuferev, Avicode</em></strong></a> <a href="http://spb.agiledays.ru/"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/172/954/895/172954895c760177ed42cc3c4fdef4cf.jpg" align="left"></a>  <a href="http://spb.agiledays.ru/"><strong><em># 6 Storyotypes: The Danes Rawsthorne, Danube Technologies, Inc.</em></strong></a> <a href="http://spb.agiledays.ru/"><br></a> <br>  Familiar with UserStories?  Think they are not effective enough?  Communicating with Dan, I once said that many people are afraid of the ‚Äúeasy‚Äù format of UserStories.  To which he replied that many of them simply do not know how to write.  On Agiledays, Dan will tell you how to organize, type, and extend the functions of UserStories with the help of Storyotyping practice and not lose ‚Äúease.‚Äù <br><br>  <a href="http://spb.agiledays.ru/"><strong><em># 7 Scrumban Alexey Korsun, ScrumTrek</em></strong></a> <a href="http://spb.agiledays.ru/"><br></a> <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/33a/e1a/8cd/33ae1a8cd47b1b8f1932e97e75f14396.jpg" align="right"><br>  <a href="http://spb.agiledays.ru/"><strong><em># 8 Who is in charge of this whole mess?</em></strong></a>  <a href="http://spb.agiledays.ru/"><strong><em>Sergey Dmitriev, Making Waves</em></strong></a> <a href="http://spb.agiledays.ru/"><br></a>  Our guest is from Norway, a candidate for the Certified Scrum Trainer.  Everyone knows that a lot of things in Agile are tied to a self-organized, self-managing team, but many are failing with Agile.  What is the reason?  As a rule, everything always comes down to people and responsibility.  Seregey wonders about the definition of responsibility in teams.  How to plant and how to cultivate it?  Answers - in the report. <br><br>  <a href="http://spb.agiledays.ru/"><strong><em># 9 Joint project of Agile project - F-Secure's experience, Gabor Gunyho, F-Secure</em></strong></a> <a href="http://spb.agiledays.ru/"><br></a>  Do you think that you cannot use Agile just because you have a development of 140 people?  Too much?  Unable to plan development?  Only not for F-secure! <br>  Gabor will talk about the practice of Business iteration planning - the company's experience in organizing the work of more than 15 teams in working on a single project. <br><br>  <a href="http://spb.agiledays.ru/"><strong><em># 10 Archi-WFP, Dmitry Viktorov, F-Secure</em></strong></a> <a href="http://spb.agiledays.ru/"><br></a>  You may not like agile methods because Agile means no architecture design.  This is certainly not the case.  Dmitry Viktorov will talk about how architecture is designed in conditions where it is not always possible to predict what the product will look like at the end of the release.  Do you need an architect in Agile?  What is Agile architecture?  All this will be discussed at the Archi-WFP session (runway). <br><br>  <a href="http://spb.agiledays.ru/"><strong><em># 11 Distributed SCRUM - to be collocated, Mikhail Ganchikov, ExigenServices</em></strong></a> <a href="http://spb.agiledays.ru/"><br></a>  <a href="http://spb.agiledays.ru/"><strong><em># 12 Study of the success of software development projects in Russia and the CIS.</em></strong></a>  <a href="http://spb.agiledays.ru/"><strong><em>Andrei Maglyas, Lappeenranta University of Technology (LUT)</em></strong></a> <a href="http://spb.agiledays.ru/"><br></a> <br>  In late 2009 - early 2010, it was decided to conduct a study on the success of software development projects in the post-Soviet space.  According to many software development experts, the results were interesting and should be made public. <br><br>  <a href="http://spb.agiledays.ru/"><strong><em># 13 Agile features for a corporate non-agile customer.</em></strong></a>  <a href="http://spb.agiledays.ru/"><strong><em>Sergey Andrzheevsky, First Line Software</em></strong></a> <a href="http://spb.agiledays.ru/"><br></a>  <a href="http://spb.agiledays.ru/"><strong><em># 14 Using Pulse in Assessing Fixed Price Agile Projects, Anna Obukhova, Exigen Services</em></strong></a> <br><br>  <a href="http://spb.agiledays.ru/"><strong><em># 15 Evolution of processes in Agile - how not to repeat the fate of dinosaurs, Pavel Antonenko, CS Odessa</em></strong></a> <a href="http://spb.agiledays.ru/"><br></a> <br><br>  <a href="http://spb.agiledays.ru/"><strong><em># 16 Smart design: approaches to the decomposition of UI design tasks in Agile teams.</em></strong></a>  <a href="http://spb.agiledays.ru/"><strong><em>Andrey Shapiro</em></strong></a> <a href="http://spb.agiledays.ru/"><br></a> <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0a9/fcf/00a/0a9fcf00a92a81113759a8a648437392.jpg" align="right"><br>  The most interesting report for me personally, since I have been engaged in research on the problem of developing interfaces in Agile for a long time.  And so, Andrei Shapiro, after long requests, agreed to talk about the best UI design practices. <br><br>  <a href="http://spb.agiledays.ru/"><strong><em># 17 My light, mirror ... or how to turn the product facing the user.</em></strong></a>  <a href="http://spb.agiledays.ru/"><strong><em>Maxim Gaponov, CarOperator</em></strong></a> <a href="http://spb.agiledays.ru/"><br></a>  No less interesting report.  You can create a good Backlog, have a good Scrum, get a good release with rich functionality, but still be an outsider: users are not comfortable and incomprehensible, and your product is failed.  Maxim will analyze all the product design stages and try to show typical mistakes. <br><br>  <a href="http://spb.agiledays.ru/"><strong><em># 18 Collect and manage requirements using cooperative business games.</em></strong></a>  <a href="http://spb.agiledays.ru/"><strong><em>Nikita Filippov, ScrumTrek</em></strong></a> <a href="http://spb.agiledays.ru/"><br></a> <br>  My report is extremely simple - there are a lot of activities: collecting feedback, collecting requirements from an analyst, marketing research, etc.  The question is how to reduce the cost, speed up and improve these processes.  For me, the answer is - you need to reveal the creativity of people with the help of special business games.  We will talk about this.  Everything that I will talk about, we use in real practice with various companies.  It is not yet clear whether this will be a report or a master class, but I think it will be interesting! <br><br>  <a href="http://spb.agiledays.ru/"><strong><em># 19 Kanban implementation experience.</em></strong></a>  <a href="http://spb.agiledays.ru/"><strong><em>Real example.</em></strong></a>  <a href="http://spb.agiledays.ru/"><strong><em>The first results.</em></strong></a>  <a href="http://spb.agiledays.ru/"><strong><em>Anton Marchenko, TargetProcess</em></strong></a> <a href="http://spb.agiledays.ru/"><br></a> <br><br>  We also have several <a href="http://spb.agiledays.ru/masterclass.html"><strong>master classes</strong></a> worth visiting. <br><br><h2>  What awaits us more .. </h2><br><br>  Two trainings from world-class masters. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a51/b04/4f0/a51b044f037a2aeeebd43dc8dff9bda7.png" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c75/6c3/739/c756c3739d73cf1e47022fb3c52ad7a8.png" alt="image"><br><h4>  Certified Scrum Master </h4>  <a href="http://scrumtrek.ru/trainings-timetable/register/71">(September 15-16)</a> <br>  This is a two-day training, at the end of which the participant will become a certified scrum master and will receive a diploma. <br>  Training will be given by Dan Rawsthorne, a coach from Danube.  Very (very!) Competent man. <br>  Why do you need a certificate: <br><ul><li>  Perfect start for a newbie in Agile </li><li>  For those who already use Scrum - many new useful tools for working with people and making decisions </li><li>  Certificate Certified ScrumMaster.  Very valuable for western colleagues.  Yes, and always useful to get the paper to confirm knowledge. </li><li>  Membership in ScrumAlliance and access to the ‚Äúsecret‚Äù part of the ScrumAlliance website with tons of Agile resources </li><li>  The first step on the way: Certified ScrumMaster -&gt; Certified ScrumPractitioner -&gt; Certified ScrumCoach -&gt; Certified ScrumTrainer </li><li>  Information about yourself can be placed on a profile in ScrumAlliance (for example, like this: <a href="http://www.scrumalliance.org/profiles/28-dan-rawsthorne-phd">www.scrumalliance.org/profiles/28-dan-rawsthorne-phd</a> ) </li></ul><br><h4>  Coaching Agility Training </h4>  <a href="http://scrumtrek.ru/trainings-timetable/register/88">(September 15-16)</a> <br><br>  The training was originally intended for those who want to engage in Agile-coaching in their company (and not only).  In fact, this is just some continuation of the standard Scrum training.  The training will be mega-useful to scrum masters who have problems and questions.  So if you already have experience in Agile, but not everything works out - come, discuss and find a way out. <br><br>  Very useful ( <a href="http://scrumtrek.ru/trainings-timetable/register/88">and inexpensive!</a> ) Two-day event.  Conducted by David Hussman, an intelligent and experienced coach with extensive international experience. <br><br>  At one time, the training cleared my brains very well, so with a clear conscience I recommend.  Interesting content and mega useful discussions.  From a particularly memorable one - about the departure / dismissal of team members and the understanding that turned out to be very useful to me about how and where and what practices to use - and most importantly, where to stay.  However, you may find other things useful. <br><br>  Both trainings will be held in English.
