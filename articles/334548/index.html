I successfully found five thousand ways that are no good. ‚Äù  Although failures are an important and natural stage in creating new solutions, we still strive for success and try to avoid unnecessary defeats.  Unfortunately, in the world of the Internet of things today we are seeing too many blunders that could have been avoided. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/678/003/adc/678003adc32a4847b0fb1bcc19420181.jpg" width="100%"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  According to a new study published by Cisco (‚ÄúCisco: Most IoT projects not a complete success‚Äù), this trend is becoming more pronounced.  According to the survey results, three quarters of all IoT projects cannot be considered ‚Äúcompletely successful‚Äù.  60% have stalled at the concept development stage, which indicates that companies lack the necessary tools for proper implementation of IoT projects.  And this is very annoying, because the Internet of things offers considerable opportunities for enterprises, allowing you to increase efficiency, improve customer service and increase revenue. <br><br>  The survey identified the following main factors hindering the successful implementation of IoT projects:

    <ul><li>  Modest in-house Internet expertise </li><li>  Long time required to complete projects </li><li>  Poor data quality </li><li>  Lack of integration between different teams. </li><li>  Budget overrun </li></ul><br>  Fortunately, there are ways to overcome all these difficulties. <br><br><h3>  The key is to work together </h3><br>  Many enterprises could benefit from expert consulting services in developing reliable security infrastructure for IoT projects or creating effective and timely solutions, and with their help avoiding failures traditionally accompanied by high financial and labor costs.  The GSMA, in its <a href="https://www.gsma.com/iot/future-iot-networks/iot-security-guidelines/">security</a> recommendations <a href="https://www.gsma.com/iot/future-iot-networks/iot-security-guidelines/">in IoT projects,</a> recently drew attention to the importance of risk assessment prior to project implementation and the role of life cycle management, urging corporations to use external partners to create adaptive and reliable security models that would counteract rapidly <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/gemaltorussia/blog/314352/">evolving cyber attack methods</a> .  In addition, such cooperation allows corporations to focus on those areas where they are able to create the greatest value, and to provide solutions to complex problems associated with the implementation of IoT-projects, specialists.  Thanks to the use of specialized devices and <a href="http://www.gemalto.com/m2m/solutions/application-enablement/m2m-cloud-platform">platforms for transferring data to the cloud</a> , they can instantly create new IoT services based on already proven elements.  All this allows us to overcome difficulties, minimize costs, speed up the time to bring new services to the market and eliminate the risks associated with launching ambitious IoT projects. <br><br>  One interesting example of such projects is a joint solution with the Berlin-based company Bonaverde, which offers a solution for making perfect coffee from significantly different grains collected at different times in different places - each bag of coffee is tagged with an RFID tag containing instructions for the coffee machine according to individual qualities of coffee beans.  Through the use of cloud technologies, additional materials about manufacturers ‚Äî stories, videos, and photographs ‚Äî which give them greater individuality and awareness, are also becoming available to customers. <br><br><h3>  Building trust in the Internet of Things ecosystem </h3><br>  Security is one of the aspects that can delay the successful implementation of IoT projects.  We observed a lot of sensational cases where hackers managed to take advantage of vulnerabilities and gain access to confidential data or even stop the work of entire networks.  Companies can prepare for such scenarios by implementing the so-called ‚Äúsecurity by design‚Äù approach, using the strict security infrastructure implemented on the IoT device at the earliest stages.  By investing in good practice and using expert advice, companies can increase the security of all project participants, and the IoT initiatives themselves will more than meet their expectations.  In addition, secure infrastructures create <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/gemaltorussia/blog/309294/">conditions for the development of IoT devices</a> , since security updates can be released throughout their sometimes rather long life cycles. <br><br><h3>  From data collection to qualitative analysis </h3><br>  Investing in the Internet of Things means that there will be more data at the disposal of enterprises that can be used in strategic planning or to identify areas for improvement.  Competent implementation of the Internet of Things monetization strategy is able to provide a real insight into how customers consume products or services.  This will allow companies to turn into adaptive enterprises and help them implement new services or pay-as-you-go models that would provide a stable source of income even after a long time after their customers made their first purchase.  If everyone who participates in the project launch is aware of the opportunities that are opening up, it is likely that we will see more enthusiasm in the implementation and implementation of IoT initiatives. <br><br>  Although there has been tremendous progress in the field of the Internet of Things over the past few years, companies still face certain difficulties.  In the world of the Internet of Things, it is possible to guarantee with a high degree of confidence that those companies that have decided to hire the services of specialists and turn to them for advice with a much higher probability will be able to successfully implement their IoT projects. <br><br>  And in your opinion, what is the key factor due to which companies can fully realize the potential of their IoT project? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/334548/">https://habr.com/ru/post/334548/</a></p>
