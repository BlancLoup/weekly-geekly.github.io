I would like to talk about the different approaches of developers to enter this site and what happens.  Autumn turned out to be generous for the projects of our neighbors in the CIS - the Ukrainians, despite the fact that this summer Kickstarter owners installed very serious filters for foreigners to access their site! <br><br>  Literally with a difference of several days, two very high-quality, but at the same time very different Ukrainian projects appeared at Kickstarter, which are very interesting to compare with each other, which prompted me to dig their roots deeper.  The results of the research led me to thoughts that I decided to share.  Both projects are perfectly decorated and have another similarity - a rather long history, since they were started at about the same time - in the spring of 2012.  In both was a huge amount of effort and labor, but the authors are so different and moved in completely opposite ways.  The first reminds of the graduate work of an MBA school graduate, and the second is an attempt to realize the dream of a damn talented programmer who is obsessed with the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating a game of the highest level. <br>  Well, let's arrange a virtual duel for them, if you want to be the arbiter, I invite you to the cat. <a name="habracut"></a>

    <h4>  The first project is Petkub, a toy for pets and their loving owners. </h4><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/c71/940/e8e/c71940e8e6091b35c4bb261836bcc570.jpg"><br><br>  <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/petcube/petcube-stay-closer-to-your-pet">www.kickstarter.com/projects/petcube/petcube-stay-closer-to-your-pet</a> <br><br>  The author of this project has previously posted his post on the pages of this portal, so I will be brief in the description, because you can always read the details in the original. <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/159763/">habrahabr.ru/post/159763</a> <br><h6>  Actually, the idea is simple - a device in the form of a cube in which a webcam with a microphone, a speaker, and a laser pointer are mounted. </h6>  All this connects to the Internet and thanks to this the owner should be able to not only watch his pet, but also communicate with him through voice and even play a simple game - catch up with the laser bunny. <br><br>  I will not bore the reader with technical analysis of the gadget and thinking about how successful the choice of case was, I would only note that the uncomplicated idea is compensated by a potentially wide range of potential buyers - even if every thousandth user of the network who views pictures of cats and dogs, will think about buying this accessory, then you can become a millionaire.  The only question is to introduce the new product to the widest possible audience.  Apparently this is how the author of the cube thought, judging by his actions.  First of all, he assembled a small team, the guys quickly and not bothering too much riveted a prototype of improvised means, even acting somehow, developed a stylish design of the device and, for greater persuasiveness, called it ‚Äúthe first robot for animals‚Äù. <br><br>  Subsequently, instead of the word robot, the word ‚Äúgadget‚Äù began to appear more and more often, but this did not prevent them from deploying a wide advertising campaign, on which the main activity of the team was focused throughout the year.  Young people acted with such a scale and system that it suggests that it was not without the leading and guiding role of an experienced investor.  The work began to boil over - participation in numerous exhibition events, articles in the world press, design of pages in social networks, communication in forums, corporate identity development, company registration ... In a word, the project resembles a carefully planned and tastefully conducted advertising campaign, the successful start of which was supported by the world press fundraising at the Kickstarter site.  $ 100,000 for two days is an excellent result, especially for Ukrainian guys.  Actually the development of "iron" in general, too, was not in place - a second prototype was created.  True, it was more like the first one than a stylish cube, familiar to us from the commercial, but it probably became more functional. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/d13/133/466/d1313346654c601b64492b35af496ce8.jpg"><br><br>  As soon as it became clear that the project was accurately raising funds, the team immediately flew to Shenzhen to make it possible for local craftsmen to bring their creation to the promised appearance and functionality.  We wish them good luck.  I am sure that the Beckers and their pets will be pleased with the result ... for a couple of weeks for sure.  Then, of course, the toy will bother many people and will further perform the role of a dust collector or an unusual piece of furniture.  In addition, it is very useful when it is necessary to entertain the children of the visiting couple for the evening so that they do not get confused during dinner.  But after all, by and large, this fate awaits almost all toys! <br><br><h4>  The second project is a multiplatform game Universum: War Front, </h4><h5>  which struck me with the spectacle of her video, laid out on the COP, from the first viewing. </h5><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/291/3b6/560/2913b6560e4d3e4d5c3db717c401b414.jpg"><br><br><h5>  First, a little history. </h5><br>  According to the author, this creation should not yield to its gaming atmosphere and RTS elements of Starcraft, but at the same time have the dynamics of fights with first-person control like Battlefield and it looks like he very closely managed to approach this goal. <br>  I will not paint all the delights of the game, my post is not devoted to this, and those who wish can not only watch the video, but also get to know it in more detail by clicking on the link: <br>  <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/starworksart/universum-war-front-fps-rts-moba-rpg-in-one-space">www.kickstarter.com/projects/starworksart/universum-war-front-fps-rts-moba-rpg-in-one-space</a> <br>  The creator of this project went the exact opposite way - he developed his game exclusively on his own, in the style of a secret operation. <br>  Like many others who saw the demo, I still can‚Äôt completely believe that everything, from graphics to music, was developed by one person with what seemed to be such a characteristic fate for our time.  Since childhood, Kirill attended art school, then became interested in programming and as a result he graduated from a technical college, at the same time mastering 3D graphics in 3DMax and Maya.  As a result, he made the development of computer games a matter of his life.  For 10 years, I managed to work as a programmer and work as a programmer and in senior positions in game projects of various directions, from three-dimensional shooters Pirate Hunter and Red Coin to a strategic city builder CitiesXL. And then I squeezed the crisis, all serious gaming companies in Kiev stopped only casual games remained of their existence, the work on them did not bring any satisfaction. <br><br>  As a result, he decides to take a step insane in our time - he quits his job, locks himself in his own apartment, and for one and a half years devotes all his time to developing the game of his dreams.  Performing work and programmer and designer, and even a composer, spending at the computer sometimes 16 hours a day!  Moreover, the secret of the project was devoted only a few closest friends.  Perhaps, no one would have known about his venture so far, but he brought the product to perfection if the money had not started to run out and had not made an attempt to get the money necessary for the end of the project at the most famous crowdfunding platform. <br>  One of the friends from previous projects from Boston - Brian Dean agreed to help him with the organization of the American campaign for the Kickstarter. <br><br><h5>  Hope and reality. </h5><br>  Kirill rightly hoped for the effect of a bombshell and high fees in the first days, but since the rate for him was too high, he chose the minimum amount needed for the end of development as a lower limit of project fees for a game of this level. Well, very little. <br>  As is often the case, gifted people are not too versed in human psychology and business and the result was unexpected for him. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/231/74a/cf5/23174acf5fbb1b53c6b31de560440f1a.jpg"><br><br>  Opening the page of the game, the Beckers are initially surprised by the excellent quality of the video; many people like the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe game, the graphics and the gameplay, but it‚Äôs so hard to believe that only one and a half years had done this kind of work and that he was able to bring it to perfection in 20 kilobax.  And here the arisen admiration supersedes the worm of doubt.  Becker trying to read more about this project, but even the ubiquitous Internet can not help them in this.  There are practically no publications.  The result - many people choose to wait and see, and the game with a huge potential in two days collected less than $ 5,000, that is, 20 times less than Petcub for the same time! <br><br>  The current situation very well illustrates the fact that KickStarter, which was originally conceived as a chance for talented individuals to carry out their unique project, is increasingly turning into a convenient tool in the hands of marketers.  One of the steps in the promotion of mass products by venture investors, and a carefully conducted advertising campaign greatly increases the chances of success, the main thing is that the cost of it does not exceed revenues. <br>  However, the indies still have chances for success! <br><br>  I guess I‚Äôm a romantic and I want to believe so much that geniuses on earth haven‚Äôt passed away, otherwise it‚Äôs hard to explain why, despite the fact that I adore cats and not too carried away with games, I decided to support the second one of these two in my wonderful projects. <br><br><h4>  And you?  Whose side are you in the battle of these antipodes? </h4><br><h6>  PS Before submitting the article to your attention I looked again at the site of the kickstarter.  It seems that Kirill worked on the bugs and began serious work with the press and his fees accelerated.  Better late than never!  Of course, Petkub will not catch up with him this time, but he should also collect the amount to make his dream come true, because he has almost a month left for it!  And this means that friendship will win in a duel. </h6></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/196286/">https://habr.com/ru/post/196286/</a></p>
