      I recently returned from New Jersey from the stunning Tony Robbins seminar ‚ÄúUnleash The Power Within‚Äù.  I visit it for the fourth time already, and after each such event my life rises to a new level. <br>  During the 4-day ‚Äúfull immersion‚Äù seminar, I recorded many videos and filled out a whole notebook with notes.  I wanted to create a detailed review ‚ÄúFree your inner strength‚Äù in order to share the obtained useful knowledge and magical impressions of the event with everyone. <br><br>  In the framework of the review ‚ÄúFree inner strength‚Äù I will create a separate post for each of the 4 days of the seminar.  It turned out that I have a lot of information to share!  If I put all this in one article, it would be huge.  Even this post, dedicated to the first day of the event, already promises to be quite large. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">‚ÄúUnleash Internal Power‚Äù - Day 1: Turning Fear into Force</font> </h2><br>  Before the start of the first day, I recorded a video in my hotel room.  In it, I wanted to tell a little about my perspectives and impressions of how Tony Robbins has already changed my life for the better. <br><br>  Here is a short 4-minute video: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/HtgjFYTE1UY%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhi62RPCBtsyuKeyCpInqdNCpTWIVw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  On Thursday morning, I arrived at the Meadowlands Convention Center in New Jersey.  Getting inside, we immediately begin to feel incredible energy and enthusiasm.  We are in a huge room, where we are surrounded by more than 5,000 other impatient participants.  And we are ready to take our life to the next level. <br><br>  At the beginning of each day, to "wake up the crowd," dancers on the warm-up appear on the stage.  Usually they warm us up using our physiology, dancing and enjoying the music they perform.  Energy is an important part of the action ‚ÄúFree your inner strength‚Äù, because we want to take everything in the best possible way and fully absorb the information coming in during the whole event. <br><br>  This seminar is NOT similar to other similar events.  The use of music, light and energy ignites 5,000 participants and prepares them to work in full force.  The value of the energy component is very large: the information received is ASSOCIATED with the emotional state in which we are.  Therefore, if we study something amazing, being in a passive mood, it is unlikely to apply it.  And on the contrary, if we assimilate something amazing, being in the PERFORMANCE state, then, most likely, we will begin to use the received knowledge. <br><br>  When Tony Robbins came on stage, the hall literally sparkled with energy.  All were full of enthusiasm, jumped on the spot and rejoiced.  While Tony was going up to the stage, she played the tune ‚ÄúTonight's gonna be a good night!‚Äù And everyone was ready to light. <br>  One of the first things Tony spoke about is this: no one is ever ‚Äúbroken.‚Äù  In his opinion, each of us has algorithms or conditioned reflexes, which we lose again and again. <br><br>  And these models are NOT our essence.  For example, experiencing depression is not us, but simply a repeatable pattern.  Disappointment is an algorithm.  Anger is an algorithm.  And guess what else?  Happiness, enthusiasm, passion and confidence. <br><br>  Smoking is a pattern, overeating is a pattern, the use of alcohol, etc. The main thing is that it is NOT our essence, and we have the opportunity <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/sekrety-ekstrennogo-vosstanovleniya-samoobladaniya/">to change these algorithms in a few minutes</a> . <br><br><h3>  <font color="#0071c5">It's hard to change yourself.</font>  <font color="#0071c5">But to replace the template is easy.</font> </h3><br>  Another bright moment that I liked: Tony talks about how well we cope with what we are crazy about.  Everyone has certain areas of life in which we are good.  Just because of its focus on them.  If we concentrate on nutrition, then we become a dock in it.  If we focus on immersion in depression, then we do it perfectly.  Similarly, there are other cool areas in which we are also good: for example, finance, health, fitness, career, relationships, etc. <br><br>  He pointed out one important detail: we are all in something than surpass each other. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#0071c5">Failure and ruin are among the most significant things that can happen to us because they either break us or give us an incentive.</font> <font color="#0071c5"><br></font>  <font color="#0071c5">Reaching success, people celebrate.</font>  <font color="#0071c5">Suffering defeat, they think.</font>  <font color="#0071c5">And how often do we change our lives during the fun?</font>  <font color="#0071c5">But thinking, we are preparing to move it to a new level.</font> </h3><br>  One of the big lessons that Tony taught is that the CAUSE of our actions does not coincide with our original thoughts.  For example, seminar participants ask each other: ‚ÄúWhy did you come here?‚Äù.  And the majority answers something like ‚ÄúEarn more money‚Äù or ‚ÄúBecome more self-confident‚Äù or ‚ÄúAchieve such and such results in your life‚Äù. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#0071c5">The truth is this: we are trying to get not what we think.</font>  <font color="#0071c5">In REALITY, we pursue a certain feeling.</font> </h3><br>  Tony Robbins describes this as our personal ‚Äúscript.‚Äù  For example, we can strive for ‚Äúhappiness‚Äù, but at the same time set a condition: in order to become happy, I need to achieve certain results.  This is our RULES, which are usually the system of our chosen beliefs. <br><br>  The truth is that we can experience these feelings RIGHT NOW.  We do not need to wait. <br><br>  Everyone has their own description of the desired and all those things that must happen for us to get to it.  But the truth is simple: the only person who can make me feel the same feelings that I aspire for is I myself. <br>  This is a very powerful part of the workshop, because most of us have a script designed to make us unhappy.  If we plan to be happy, but at the same time we have a lot of rules that must be followed in order to <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/9-melochey-imeyushchikh-ogromnoe-znachenie-dlya-schastya/">experience happiness</a> , then we limit ourselves and do not allow ourselves to get what we strive to most actively in life. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#0071c5">We can either CHANGE the rules for achieving the desired and experience positive emotions right now, or review our plan.</font> </h3><br>  He graduated from Tony Robbins, conducting an experiment with a girl participating in the seminar.  She had a plan to be happy and a lot of rules, for example, ‚ÄúI have to control everything‚Äù and ‚ÄúEverything should be fair,‚Äù which naturally made her unhappy, because they were impossible to fulfill. <br><br>  One of the ideas that emerged during the discussion was the need to bring oneself in line with its true essence - male or female.  It turned out that this woman, trying to control everything and not letting her femininity out, became manly.  When we deviate from our natural essence, we feel unhappy, no matter what we do. <br><br>  The discussion of femininity and masculinity was one of the brightest segments of the first day of the seminar ‚ÄúFree Inner Strength‚Äù.  I <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/uroki-lyubvi-i-garmonii-ot-bryusa-springstina/">gained</a> tremendous benefits from it, especially by <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/uroki-lyubvi-i-garmonii-ot-bryusa-springstina/">achieving harmony</a> with my masculine essence. <br><br>  At the end of this video, Tony Robbins talks about two main areas of life. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">1) Achievement Science</font> </h2><br>  In life, to achieve any desired result, there is the science of achieving it.  That's what I mean: there are specific steps or strategies that can lead us to almost any result we need.  If we need a certain amount of money, there are steps to get it.  If we want to lose weight, there is also a guide for this. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">2) The art of happiness</font> </h2><br>  Although most of us focus on how to achieve more, we often forget about a more important area of ‚Äã‚Äãlife: the art of happiness.  The ability to experience satisfaction is ART, because the source of bliss is individual for each person.  Most people think that they will be happy as soon as they get to XXX.  In fact, by concentrating primarily on the sense of satisfaction, we can achieve our results more easily and quickly. <br><br>  Behavior corresponding to our masculine or feminine essence is a key component of self-realization. <br><br>  One of my favorite parts of the first day, ‚ÄúUnleash The Power Within‚Äù, is linked to the previous video, where Tony Robbins leads all the men in the hall to the state of ‚Äúmasculinity‚Äù.  He talks about what male energy is and helps men activate this part of themselves. <br><br>  The energy was extremely powerful, I felt that I was completely in my male incarnation.  It was very pleasant to hear the response of the female part of the audience: many girls said that they felt ‚Äúsafe‚Äù and ‚Äúprotected‚Äù while we were in a state of masculinity. <br><blockquote>  A person who has not found anything for which he would like to die is not suitable for life. </blockquote>  Martin luther king <br><br>  Tony said that masculinity for a man is a feeling of FREEDOM.  This is exactly the feeling when we overcame something and experience complete freedom.  He also told how a man needed a clear goal, something more than himself, for which he would die. <br><br>  But in a relationship, not only that is important, but also POLARITY.  For the existence of attraction and passion in them must always be male and female forces.  Tony complains that today, most men are feminine, and women are becoming more manly.  This is a departure from its natural essence, creating a feeling of dissatisfaction. <br><br>  One of the main ideas that I have endured with ‚ÄúFree inner strength‚Äù - partly the reason that I returned to the seminar for the fourth time - is the concept of EMOTIONAL CONDITION. <br><br>  Tony Robbins explains: EMOTIONS are what controls and determines our quality of life. <br><br>  There are 3 things that control our emotional state every minute.  Tony calls them the "Emotional Triad." <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">1) Physiological system</font> </h2><br>  How we use our physical body, for example, breathing, posture, movement. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">2) Object of concentration</font> </h2><br>  Our sensations depend on what we focus on. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">3) Language / Value Algorithm</font> </h2><br>  As we add to the sensation of the word, the meaning of what we feel changes. <br><br>  Mood is the main tool that we can only master in life, because it contains the ability to change our feelings.  In the previous video, Tony demonstrates the process of using certain questions, aimed at changing the focus, and hence the state. <br><br>  The key moment of the first day of the seminar ‚ÄúFree your inner strength‚Äù - ‚ÄúFire walks‚Äù, in which practically all the guests of the event took part.  This is usually a movement on a 3.5-meter substrate with burning coals, the temperature of which ranges from 650 to 1100¬∫C. <br><br>  A walk on fire is a metaphor for overcoming fear - the only phenomenon stopping us. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">Fear is the only thing that stops us.</font> </h2><br>  Although we all experience countless varieties of fear, there are two main types of phobias common to all human beings: <br><br>  1) we are not good enough <br>  2) we will not love. <br><br>  The only way to conquer fear and pass over the fire is to put yourself in a state of absolute DEFINITION. <br><br>  You can achieve this by changing your emotional triad: physiology, focus and language.  This was the trick: Tony Robbins forced us to get up and jump in order to use our physiology, adjusting our mood. <br><br>  Being at the peak of the emotional state, we say ‚ÄúYES!‚Äù In order to create an anchor and an association between this mood and the process of pronouncing the word ‚ÄúYES!‚Äù So ‚Äã‚Äãwe give ourselves the opportunity to return to this mood at any moment. <br><br>  The state we are in determines what we will do and what will not.  It controls all of our behavior, regardless of whether we act or not.  Having created the right mood, we can get everything from ourselves. <br><br>  As you understand, the emotional state is just an algorithm that we execute.  We have emotional patterns used over and over again.  More often than not, we experience those feelings to which we ourselves and HAVE TRIED, because the most demanded emotional state becomes our ‚Äúhome‚Äù. <br><br>  If we want to become more confident, we need to TRAIN such an attitude daily to learn how to get into it, and, in the end, this will happen automatically.  The same goes for passion, inspiration, and any other emotions that we seek to experience. <br><br>  And again, SETTING is undoubtedly the main thing that I learned from Tony Robbins on "Unleash The Power Within". This is what changed my life, and what I continue to shape every day.  Every day I create a level 10 state, and the more I do it, the more it becomes habitual for me. <br><br>  Having noticed a feeling of tiredness, laziness, depression, anger, frustration, etc., I immediately interrupt this algorithm and create my desired mood.  Having done this a sufficient number of times, we automatically begin to constantly feel the way we want.  No effort is required. <br><br>  Tony used a great metaphor, comparing SETTING and muscle.  The more often we bring ourselves to the desired state, the stronger it becomes.  To grow muscle, we push ourselves beyond what we are used to.  So it is here: when we feel that we are not in the best mood, we need to ‚Äúkick‚Äù ourselves and create it.  If we can do this, then we will definitely develop. <br><br>  Day 1 of the seminar ‚ÄúRelease your inner strength‚Äù gave many other useful lessons that I did not mention here.  For example, ‚Äú6 human needs‚Äù, which deals with the reasons for our actions.  I do not want to talk about them here, but for those who want to learn more, I am ready to recommend any of the works of Tony Robbins or his seminars. <br><br>  I returned to the hotel around two o'clock in the morning and decided to record a video of all the main lessons that I learned during the day and place it below.  As you can see, I am in a great mood, even despite physical fatigue and loss of voice. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/tnLU_ejKa24%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhi2ZESlI46ECT19OE4L_xjfYFvbcw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  This is a kind of summing up the first day.
