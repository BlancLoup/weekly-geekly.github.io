What the product managers do in the company depends on how this area of ‚Äã‚Äãmanagement developed. in this company and specialists with what functions and skills it lacks.  But, frankly, the MP should do three things: research and development of a development plan, conveying ideas to developers, creating a product concept.  And so time after time. <br><br>  I have long been looking for tools that are suitable for the most efficient conduct of affairs in the role of MP.  I share the findings with you (some of them are still in beta).  I was looking for this:

      strategy planning tool that allows you to manage ideas and feedback <br>  priority management and decision support <br>  visualization of the development stages of the top level, and linking them to employees working in different "streams" <br>  integration with tools for tracking functions, product management and other software <br>  interactive design <br>  acceptable price <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Prodpad </h4><br>  Advertised as a tool for strategic communication, managing the global vision of the product, and generally meets all my requirements.  This almost comprehensive product offers to visualize your strategy, team collaboration, product function management, feedback, prioritization. <br>  Cons - the interface is very loaded, and I can not always focus on tasks.  Sometimes the workflow is quite complex.  Cost is calculated by the number of users.  The most profitable plan looks $ 59 / month. <br><br><h4>  ProdThink </h4><br>  Used to collect and sort feedback on various product features.  You can collect user feedback within the application.  You can share the information obtained with the co-owners of the product, arrange a vote and measure the levels of interest.  The cost depends on the number of admin licenses. <br><br><h4>  Aha.io </h4><br>  Allows you to manage queries, deadlines, assign functions, plan the workload of developers and engage in strategic planning.  In general, more opportunities are offered for project management than for product management.  The interface is pretty loaded.  Of the benefits - integration with Jira, Github and the ability to assign web hooks.  The cost starts from $ 59 per user per month. <br><br><h4>  Validately </h4><br>  A great tool for checking requirements and testing usability.  Eliminates the need to develop working functions for testing them on clients, since you can do this with high-quality layouts.  There is a free trial period, and paid plans vary from $ 49 to $ 249 per month.  Integrates with InVision and Axureshare. <br><br><h4>  ProductPlan </h4><br>  A tool for developing plans and communication.  It allows you to make plans with time frames and visual themes, plan tasks in great detail, convert them into a visual format for presentation to the team, and work together with the team on feedback.  The cost depends on the number of people in the team.  The quality of the product is confirmed by their cooperation with Paypal, Adobe and Constant Contact. <br><br><h4>  Interstate </h4><br>  Developing plans, managing them as projects allows you to include your user community in the development process.  However, while it is not possible to visualize collective plans, you can only view the current status of the plan items.  The cost of the product is the lowest among competitors, $ 9 per person per month, plus there is a free version for 1 project and 2 users. <br><br><h4>  Uberito </h4><br>  Positioned as an industrial-level program for product management.  There are opportunities to manage plans, ideas, features, tracking implementation and outstanding tasks, time planning ... While the project is still only under development, and prices have not yet been determined.  He clearly needs to work on usability, speed, and integration with popular project management tools. <br><br><h4>  SensorSix </h4><br>  A collaborative product management tool for professionals.  Opportunities to work together on ideas and feedback, analysis of proposals and facilitate decision-making.  The three payment plans are entrepreneurial ($ 19 / month), professional ($ 99 / month) and premium ($ 499 / month).  For work with reviews of experts and customers a separate fee.  Supports export and import with Excel and Powerpoint.  I would like to see more opportunities for integration.  You can also work on the interface to make the product more attractive. <br><br><h4>  Reqqs </h4><br>  The product is still in development, and so far there is no opportunity to test even the beta version.  It is argued that it will be able to assist in setting priorities for product functions, taking into account such things as profitability, strategic benefit, customer interest, and development and launch costs.  Plans to include support for collaboration and acceptance of feedback.  Planning includes presentation and analytics.  It is too early to judge how it will be really useful. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/293192/">https://habr.com/ru/post/293192/</a></p>
