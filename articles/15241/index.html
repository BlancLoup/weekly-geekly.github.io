  <section class="page js-page"><h1>A letter from the country of the Soviets to the head of Apple Computer Inc., Steve Jobs</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> In this blog, I am going to publish my analytical notes on computer topics.  They are written regularly for me, but I wanted to start with the oldest: <br>  One of the first articles, which appeared at the end of 2004 and the beginning of 2005, and then was published on the MacTime company website: <a href="http://www.mactime.ru/Environ/WebObjects/mactime.woa/wa/Main%3Ftextid%3D5107%26level1%3Dmactimes">A letter from the country of the Councils to the head of Apple Computer Inc. to Steve Jobs</a> <br>  In this article, the development trends of Apple, which were soon embodied in real products, were foreseen: 1).  Release of computers Apple MacMini;  2).  Apple Mac transitions to Intel processors;  3).  Apple TV release. <br><br>  Somewhere around 1994, I read an article in one of the computer magazines, which predicted the beginning of an era of competition (or even a battle for life and death) of computer corporations with giant corporations producing consumer electronics.  In this article, it was imagined how Sony would enter the market with a ‚Äútelevision computer‚Äù, and, for example, IBM with a ‚Äúhome computer TV‚Äù and this is where the main battle will occur in the consumer electronics market.  To be honest, I had no idea what a ‚Äúhome computer TV‚Äù was, and even from IBM - it was somehow difficult to imagine an IBM device connecting to a TV set (such as Spectrum Z80).  But now, we survived until 2005 and saw how IBM, together with Toshiba, are going to release a microprocessor for Sony PlayStantion 3.  And the day is not far away when IBM may want to release home appliances for TVs (since its processor is almost ready for them). <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  But I would like to draw attention to another major player in the computer market.  I worked all my life on IBM PC-compatible computers, but always had respect for Steve Jobs and watched the company's business with a strange, for the computer market, the name Apple.  And in recent years, somehow, she began to behave strangely: instead of participating in megahertz races in the computer market, for some reason she began to engage in "bytovuhoy" (it should be "kitchen" the name does not give rest).  Not only did Apple climb into the consumer electronics market, but she was not afraid to engage in direct competition with Sony.  Now in America, no one needs Walkmans, but give everyone iPods, and more beautiful ones.  The most interesting thing is that not only Apple, but also crafty Microsoft, which smells money very precisely, has leaped into this market.  Microsoft has long been trying to turn around in the domestic market and make everyone happy with its cheap Xbox prefix (competing with the same Sony prefixes), but in addition with its WebTV, and of course, no home computer will be without MS Windows Media Center soon. <br>  Of course, Apple‚Äôs leadership acted wisely, because Macintosh computers are good, but they are expensive and therefore do not sell well.  Recall at least the end of the 90s when there were no iPods yet and the company was on the verge of bankruptcy (strangely enough, Microsoft helped her with money then).  So, for example, I would be happy to work seriously on the Apple Macintosh, but unfortunately I have not been able to do this yet.  In Russia, where a salary of $ 500 is considered high, it is a pity to spend the extra $ 100.  But even in America, judging by the market occupied by Macintosh, I think every cent and do not want to overpay for Apple Macintosh when there is a cheap IBM PC.  Therefore, having replaced 3 generations of computers from PC XT to Pentium-IV at home, I always bought an IBM-compatible PC, spending no more than $ 700 on a new technology and getting a modern computer for the money.  And Apple, as it were, heard my complaints about the high cost of their computers and released Mac mini for only $ 500.  Thank you, but this is not for me again.  Because it is a computer for circulation in I-net or for work in MS Word, but for example: not for publishing work.  This is a Pentium-III level computer, I broke up with such a computer 2 years ago and again I don‚Äôt need to go back to the braking Adobe PhotoShop. <br><br>  But if Apple took on competing with Sony, then it‚Äôs time to survive to take more serious steps in the consumer electronics market.  Apple has long been time to release a home "entertainment center."  Apple could make a great product by connecting: a Mac mini, a TV tuner, a good Audio card, and a SuperDrive for DVD recording, all packed in a stylish case like the ASUS DiGiMatrix.  That would make a great home theater connected to the TV, to the delight of all buyers and to the envy of Sony.

      And the main advantage of this set-top box in a convenient for a person MacOS X system under which a lot of entertainment and training programs have already been written, which will be useful for the home man in the street.  However, in such a prefix, you may need a shell on top of the OS and, up to the primitive, which simplifies the calling of basic functions, so that a regular user of a VCR would cope.  Here it is - a product for a huge market, the truth is completely different than the computer one.  In this market, they don‚Äôt spend from 1,500 to 4,000 dollars for the equipment Apple is used to.  Here, after all, the product should cost no more than $ 500, and the less the better - then you need a product for the people, that is, a banal pop.  In the consumer electronics market, Japanese corporations are leading the show as leading production workers thanks to cheap products made for the people.  A modern multimedia Mac on the PowerPC platform is very difficult to make for $ 500, because the Mac mini has only one Audio output, as it is rather weak for a home theater.  Therefore, there is a need to switch to a cheap (pop) platform.  And what a popular platform in the computer market is, of course, an IBM PC on Intel x86 processors.  In addition, Apple has long suffered from an insufficient number of PowerPC processors, and if it enters the home video market now, you probably will not be able to release the necessary number of consoles to meet demand.  And the most important thing is that both Apple Computer and Next Computer, both managed by Steve Jobs, have twice lost to competitors by launching excellent products to the market, but for huge money - Apple failed in 1982 with expensive LISA computers, and Next in 1989 released NeXTcube computer at a price of $ 10 thousand. Which basically remained a strange sight at exhibitions and in university laboratories, and did not go to the masses.  And if you look at the struggle of the console players who developed between Sony and Microsoft, the latter successfully entered the market with its Xbox due to its low price of its product, and not some technical advantages over PlayStantion2.  For this, I do not agree, with some reviews of the development of technology in which it is said that for the consumer electronics market it does not matter which processor is in the console - it is not very important, it is important that there is cheap hardware in the household console, but in reality the cheapest iron has a market for IBM PC-compatible computers. <br><br>  Therefore, I am very skeptical about how IBM and Toshiba make the Cell superprocessor which is suitable for supercomputers, and not like Sony PlayStation3.  I think Sony has become proud of the success in the consumer electronics market and will get a serious blow from the Microsoft Xbox2 pops, built just on the cheap IBM PC architecture.  But we all know about the quality of Microsoft products.  Microsoft Windows is a bad story, because it is a continuous glitch, namely, it is installed in the Xbox.  Why is everybody afraid to compete in the market with the "fine".  This is not at all scary, but it is a huge corporation, but all its products have always been buggy, but it wins competitors, and earns a lot of money, often with cunning and strange as it is free (that is, cheap, and often free software). <br><br>  And if Apple dares to transfer its ‚ÄúOS‚Äù MacOS X to cheap Intel x86 processors, then it will get a cheap platform based on which you will get a cheap, which means folk home ‚Äúentertainment center‚Äù like MS Xbox but not with a buggy Windows, but with serious MacOS X. But the question is whether such a powerful system is needed on a home console, PalmOS can be better placed there, but the fact of the matter is that for small systems there are no programs like Apple iLife for editing Video, DVD recording and of course not a full-fledged one. QuickTime player with the ability to watch HD TV, and probably  o Doom III toys will not appear soon.  Well, what kind of entertainment center without such programs, I personally do not need such a center.  But if there appeared a home prefix for TV, and on which almost all entertainment, training and not only MacOS X programs are available, and no more than $ 500, I think buyers would stand in line (well, when they tried it out, which is why) and would stand the night on the span.  Similarly, what was the crush in the American stores for the first version of MacOS X in 2001.  And this is all because the demos are very fond of pop music, but of high quality and that would not be expensive, but better even for free.  After all, MacOS X is in fact the former NeXTstep, only the latter was sold for about $ 1,000 before, and then they started selling a good system for only $ 130 (price of MacOS X).  Similarly, one could do with Macintosh - now it is not sold to everyone, because it is expensive, and if you translate Macintosh to the popular Intel x86 processor, then there will not be a halt from customers. <br><br>  Therefore, I think that for Apple Macintosh computers, it is already time to switch from PowerPC processors to Intel x86 processors and, accordingly, Apple already has time to release its ‚ÄúOS‚Äù for the IBM PC platform.  Apple Computer had once (in 1994) switched from Motorola 68k to PowerPC, and Next Computer successfully switched from Motorola 68k to Intel x86 processors.  Therefore, Apple already has vast experience in this business, you just need to want: <br><br>  one).  We need to rewrite the MacOS X kernel for Intel x86 processors, but it already exists - this kernel most likely should have remained from NeXTstep for Intel OS.  After all, it is known that MacOS X is built on the basis of the object-oriented OS NeXTstep, but it was not tied to hardware and supported 4 processor families: Motorola 68k, Intel x86, HP PA-RISC, and Sun SPARC.  And the new kernel functions are developed in the project OpenDarwin. <br><br>  2).  It is necessary to rewrite the programs written for the PowerPC processor for the new Intel x86 processor.  But the programs already rewritten under MacOS X for Cocoa objective-oriented environment practically do not require changes.  For Apple, you need to create a compiler for new Intel x86 processors, and all developers simply recompile their creations.  And programs written for previous versions of MacOS in modern MacOS X work in the Classic environment already in emulation mode.  And even more so, Apple knows how to make emulators of processors, since in 1994 when switching from Motorola 68k to PowerPC, a Motorola 68k processor emulator was successfully built into MacOS.  And for a smooth transition, at the beginning it would be possible to produce hybrid computers containing two processors, the first and the main Intel x86, and the second PowerPC working as an auxiliary for executing programs not yet recompiled for Intel x86. <br><br>  It is also necessary to pay attention to the important point that today the transition from 32-bit processors to 64-bit processors begins on the IBM PC market.  All modern computers have been released for more than a year on AMD Athlon 64 processors. And in the future, all processors from both AMD and Intel will have support for 64-bit computing, but there is still no available software support for 64-bit processors.  If Apple had just entered the IBM PC market with its MacOS X operating system debugged under a 64-bit platform, it would have a huge advantage over Microsoft.  Then all MacOS X programs portable from the old PowerPC platform to the new 64-bit Intel x86 would have support and advantages of 64-bit computing.  And it would be possible to advertise MacOS X as a new and real 64-bit system.  Accordingly, it would benefit AMD which is actively promoting its AMD64 architecture and it could support Apple both financially and commercially.  This is despite the fact that Microsoft is still unable to release 64-bit Windows XP, and when software vendors recompile their programs taking into account the features of 64-bit Windows XP mode, no one knows.  And most likely, no one wants to bother with switching to 64-bit mode under Windows, which means there will be 64-bit Windows XP with old 32-bit programs that do not use new features.  As a result, theoretically, the performance of programs rewritten for 64-bit Apple MacOS X for i86 will always be higher than programs running under MS Windows XP.  And if Apple immediately embeds support for dual-core processors appearing in 2005, it will generally have a huge advantage over MS Windows XP. <br><br>  And program developers, of course, are happy to recompile all their creations under Apple MacOS X for i86, since  it's a huge market with millions of users.  Well, if only Microsoft with its secret intrigues and large investments will not convince them to abandon this profitable job (after all, Microsoft managed to persuade the latter to abandon the Corel Linux project for investing in Corel).  And of course, Microsoft will refuse to release its Office under MacOS X for i86.  But it does not matter, now Apple itself has its own iWork `05, probably not the worst office suite.  And there is another great Sun company with which Apple could agree and Sun will surely agree to release its StarOffice for MacOS X. Yes, even Corel most likely will not refuse to transfer its office WordPerfect package to MacOS X. And transfer a huge amount of ‚Äúsoftware‚Äù written specially under MacOS X, coming out as early as 2001, is not at all a difficult task, again thanks to the object-oriented architecture taken from the NeXTstep OS. <br><br>  Perhaps Apple is just waiting for as many programs as possible to be rewritten for the new MacOS X and then it will be possible to abandon the old non-portable MacOS 9 system to make the transition from PowerPC to Intel x86 as painful as possible for Mac users.  In general, without the programs MacOS X for i86, and accordingly there will be no users.  I think very, very many IBM PC users will want to use such a powerful and, according to the latest tests, safest operating system (CHIP Russia magazine # 10/2004, pp 12-31; UPGRADE magazine # 46/2004, p.30).  Yes, I myself will not regret giving Apple the hard-earned $ 130 for MacOS X for i86 (if my wife allows it).  The truth is, there is a danger that the first and not Russified version of Apple MacOS X for i86 will be no less, and maybe even more buggy than MS Windows XP, but it will still be nice to have a worthy competitor who is annoyed by her boorish attitude towards Microsoft users. <br><br>  And the conclusion is which of this story: that it's time for users to buy new 64-bit computers on AMD Athlon 64 processors, and for software developers it's time to rewrite all their programs under MacOS X. And we will wait patiently for Apple to fight Microsoft.  Here I am personally confident that Apple will win.  You only need to dare, and the people will support the wonderful Apple and software products from Apple.  True, only if Apple learns how to make folk, which means cheap products, but judging by the $ 500 Mac mini, they are already thinking about us (about the people). <br><br>  So I want to say come on Apple, do not be shy!  It is time!  It's time to go.  Steve enough to think it's time to let her out of the stall of their laboratories.  We are the people, we are waiting for her, we have already missed her.  It will turn the world, in fact, like all your ideas.  We really need it - a good "OS" under "PiSyUKi."  It's time to show this snickering Gates, a real product.  Millions of people are waiting for her.  Are you really going to throw us away, are you really the same as Gates - the main thing is money, because there is no - the main thing is people and they will not forget to thank Apple with money for a good OS. <br><br>  PS: Well, if Apple still dares to enter the market of IBM PC computers, then only historians will probably remember about Microsoft ... </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/15241/">https://habr.com/ru/post/15241/</a></p>
