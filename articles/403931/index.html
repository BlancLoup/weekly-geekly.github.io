      And we came across, and here in the comments it was said more than once that the version of Xiaomi 1S, for example, is monstrous in principle, and the Mi Band 2 with good accuracy at rest under load can draw something ‚Äúfrom the bald‚Äù, which significantly reduces its In sports. <br><br>  Croise did not reach the popular optical devices in one single thing - it ‚Äúcannot in the Bluetooth heart rate monitor‚Äù, or, to put it simply, it does not synchronize anywhere except its own software. <br><br>  During sales since the end of last year, the heart rate monitor did not cause any complaints and quite honestly worked out what was stated both during physical activity and at rest.  What can Croise Urban. <br><br>  <b>Heart rate monitor</b> <br><br>  One of the strengths and one of the strange defeats.  What is good: the heart rate monitor works as if by the principle of ‚Äúthree in one‚Äù.  The user can measure the pulse on demand, can set the interval at which the bracelet will record data, as well as in the mode of a constant sports heart rate monitor. <br><br>  The pulse on demand is more or less clear.  I pressed the button, got the result, saved it in history. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/ef3/af1/ead/ef3af1eadcfd41e092dcb259cffea213.jpg"><br><br>  The ‚Äúinterval‚Äù pulse is set by the user independently: in the range from 3 minutes to 60. It is noteworthy here that you can set a bar that you would not want to step over: in this case the bracelet will give a warning. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/072/fa7/f86/072fa7f862cd4c82b12ec37faeed2b76.jpg"><br><br>  But the sports heart rate monitor is implemented, let's be honest, ambiguous: the fact is that it (there is no deception) is constant at the moment when you look at the smartphone display, which, obviously, is not always comfortable.  But Croise writes statistics with an interval: the minimum three minutes!  Pulse zones you see, but do not feel.  This moment is quite controversial.  For example, the proprietary application Mio Global also does not show the numbers, but here you can argue, they say, I can connect Mio to another software.  Here again, you can argue that for another software and its advanced features will have to pay, but ... and so on and so forth. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/188/1b8/87d/1881b887d92c4f20b041fa1600fa502c.jpg"><br><br>  In addition to the fact that the Mio and Croise charts are similar in figures, the pulsators also coincide: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/207/a6c/2fb/207a6c2fb2004d2f823810931ecdbb9e.jpg"><br><br>  As with the chest sensor Lifetrak. <br><br>  In general, with the pulse of things in this way.  It is rather stable, it is not lost on a wet hand, under water, and also rather ‚Äúperceptive‚Äù: it can act as a pulse oximeter, removing data from a fingertip. <br><br>  <b>What else can?</b> <br><br>  Croise Urban S is not an absolute classic of the genre: steps are a calorie distance, but also a sports bracelet, for which a special mode is provided with switching between types of activity.  The main menu is a collection of physical activity statistics and sleep analysis.  Additional - workouts. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/fef/1e8/845/fef1e8845c234988a8675928ca0fb7a0.jpg"><br><br>  Each workout is saved in history with its own metrics, including with the map, if you train with a smartphone: he writes after all. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/01c/4c9/7de/01c4c97dea5f4236b96cc11d252408d9.jpg"><br><br>  The calculation of calories consumed takes place according to a simple formula, which becomes clear when superimposing a ‚Äúgraph‚Äù of calories with an ‚Äúgraph‚Äù of activity: the more you move, the more you burn. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/c41/f48/b4e/c41f48b4e0e4467f8025a1b26dd8f31f.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Basic settings</b> <br><br>  The menu is quite simple and you can customize the bracelet ‚Äúfor yourself‚Äù in one window.  Here are the settings for the modes of the bracelet, notifications, and setting the heart rate monitor, etc. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/703/5e7/28a/7035e728a01e4a7d9d095046e3d8a8f2.jpg"><br><br>  Notifications that you program will be displayed with icons on the display along with a vibration signal. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/508/349/4c8/5083494c881b486bb0054a4e48516084.JPG"><br><br>  What exactly you want to see, set up individually: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/6c9/0cc/975/6c90cc975bde407eaee9d46565a6339d.jpg"><br><br>  Thus, the bracelet may also lose the Mi Band 2 directly to the same price and autonomy (Croise works depending on the selected pulse measurement mode on average for about 5 days), but there are much more sports opportunities and a much more accurate pulse.  The bracelet was originally created for those who do something more than just footsteps, but so far does not take into account the needs of a professional audience. <br><br>  <b>Design</b> <br><br>  He is ascetic.  Here is a black stripe. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/245/cb0/dea/245cb0dea48345cf8eba4d339c76b8f1.JPG"><br><br>  On the back side is an optical sensor. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/f42/ca2/1d6/f42ca21d665949d09803a28b34c55bb4.JPG"><br><br>  It is controlled by a bracelet button - pressing it switches the menu on the display.  Constantly, by the way, it does not burn. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/801/42b/682/80142b6825804e2d8d3601c81ddd7fde.JPG"><br><br>  The bracelet is packed, as it should be, in the box: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/c7f/37e/c36/c7f37ec363df41e5a33f29f2ce500ba6.JPG"><br><br>  But inside is a bit: a miniature docking station and the bracelet itself.  MicroUSB cable will have to look for yourself. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/f7b/de8/adf/f7bde8adf3f74d628ae10c5f955950e8.JPG"><br><br>  As a result, the <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/croise-pwb-200-urban-s.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeek%26utm_medium%3Dcroise%26utm_campaign%3Durban">Croise Urban S</a> turned out to be a pretty good, stable gadget with a good heart rate monitor, which works in several modes.  Something looks like a compromise, but in general, everything seems appropriate.  If it were possible to add something, then, firstly, in the sport mode, we would have left the possibility of a constantly burning display, and, secondly, the recording of the pulse per second.  It would not hurt the vibration when moving from zone to zone. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/403931/">https://habr.com/ru/post/403931/</a></p>
