  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to play "programming" or the way a programmer.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I already <a href="http://boliev.com/archives/56">wrote</a> that programming is a game, like any game, it consists of stages or levels.  To become a true professional, it is important to be able to go through these stages.  Sometimes it is difficult, sometimes even very difficult, but you must admit that this is only more interesting! <br>  Now I will try to highlight the main stages and dangers that await the programmer on this difficult, long and very exciting path.  I will try to tell you exactly how these stages go through, what needs to be done, not to collapse, and not to be one of those whom I call ‚ÄúNON-programmers‚Äù. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Stage number one: Mlyat, cho for na!? </h4><br>  One of the two most dangerous stages!  Stage - killer programmers!  This is the very first stage when a ‚Äúmere mortal‚Äù is a happy, or a person dissatisfied with life, having heard a lot of people like me, read articles like me, see how people like me live, realizing that this is cool, decides to become a programmer.  And so he goes to the store, bought the wrong books, because none of the more experienced has suggested anything, and begins to read them.  Worse, try to practice!  Further, the following picture is usually: ‚ÄúBlah, blah, blah, blah, examples from the book do not work, this operator is not described anywhere, out of ten lines of the first listing, I understood only two, and it‚Äôs not a fact that it‚Äôs right!  What are the manuals!?  What are manuals !?  Why smoke them !?  What is it!?  Gray hair !?  Where does my gray hair come from !? ‚ÄùWell, then, a good, or not very little book, goes to the toilet and serves instead of toilet paper, in order to save ... <br>  The problem is that at this stage, many begin to cram a particular language, when in fact you need to understand the basics of programming, learn to write algorithms, and be patient.  That is why, for a start, they choose languages ‚Äã‚Äãsimpler, such as QBasik, or Pascal, but we must remember that you should not get used to these languages, and you can‚Äôt write a free alternative to photoshop on them.  To begin with, simple, completely useless programs will go, just to understand what a variable is, what arrays, cycles, conditional operators are, how and where they are applied.  Simply put, you need to learn to think like a programmer, and then this stage will be passed. <br><h4>  Stage number two: Aah, that's it ... </h4><br>  And if the first stage is passed, then most likely the ‚Äúmere mortal‚Äù has embarked on the true path ... The most difficult thing is over, and you can start writing simple but useful programs that after 2-3 years without laughter will be difficult to watch ... This is a stage of disappointment, stage finding style, and gaining mastery.  The stage is when you show your code to familiar programmers, and they laugh at you, instead of pointing out errors when the computer hangs every half hour from endless cycles, and you can't understand what the problem is, when the program seems to work, but somehow wrong when you are looking at other people's listings, and do not understand anything!  At this stage, apart from thinking through the program's algorithm, the question of its implementation also arises, and not on qbasik or pascal, but on something like delphi, c ++ or php (perl, python).  To hell with the languages ‚Äã‚Äãof the 80s, at this stage useful programs are written that do not work in the black DOS window, but you didn‚Äôt know that it would be an order of magnitude more difficult ... If you used to speak culturally, now you start to curse, because the compiler cannot be otherwise!  What mistake?  What type of data?  What doesn't he like?  Why does he torment me?  What did I do wrong in life?  If I go to hell, whatever, any torment, just do not program in visual studio (Needless to say, just an example ... I hope Microsoft does not read me ...) <br>  It often happens that having heard a lot about a just-released, mega cool game, you buy it, go through the first level, and in the second, with the first serious challenge, which, in general, is passable, but takes time, effort and skill, throwing a game?  I think that often!  Similarly with programming.  It all depends on the desire.  Why did you start programming, and how much you want to become a programmer.  In order to go through this stage, we need not so much brains (although where to go without them) how much perseverance, and the study of nuances of a programming language.  Here you will have to smoke manuals, scan the Internet for similar errors and methods for solving them, study books more carefully, and in moments of despair - pray!  But as I have already said, we are passing the stage, all that is needed for this is to be patient and, in no case, not to dwell on the thought: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs impossible!‚Äù Because  THIS IS POSSIBLE!  And you know that this is possible! <br><h4>  Stage number three: I seem to be a programmer! </h4><br>  Usually, this stage begins as follows: ‚ÄúBut should I write to me ...‚Äù A rather complicated and large program is selected, days change nights, time flies, a girl throws you, all the money goes to new books, a new group ‚ÄúProgrammers‚Äù appears in the expert, Browser bookmarks are mostly programmer forums - you write a large, complex program.  There are new difficulties: you get acquainted with databases, with installers, with OOP, and this acquaintance does not always go smoothly.  However, you have two assistants who are always with the programmer at this stage: the experience of the previous stage, and inspiration!  And inspiration is a powerful thing ... At this stage it is interesting for you to write!  You have come pretty far, and you can hardly drop everything.  However ... Many go here, this is mainly due to a total disappointment in programming.  How interesting it was to write mini programs at the first two stages, yes, there were difficulties, but from the height of the third level, they do not seem so insurmountable.  And here everything is boring!  OOP?  Why is he?  Everyone is talking about this OOP, I did without it!  And also these databases, whole books are released only on database design!  Relations, connections, keys ... Chot I disliked programming !!! <br>  The main thing is not to lose heart!  Not so all difficult!  Yes, it is important to design the database correctly, but this is your first serious program!  Yes, OOP is a thing, and there is no way without it, but if you don‚Äôt understand what classes are there, methods, why inheritance, etc.  leave it, write as you like, you are not yet a professional, and enjoy programming.  Love programming!  The day will come, and you will understand all the nuances of OOP, and you will be able to make sql queries on the go, without looking in the directory, but for now, write as you wish, fall in love with programming. <br><h4>  Stage number four: Mania greatness. </h4><br>  The worst, the most dangerous and longest stage!  Many programmers remain in this stage for years, and not the fact that they will pass at all!  This is when ‚ÄúI am a cool programmer, I have already written several large programs, I know all about programming !!!  ‚ÄúAt this stage, the programmer‚Äôs development stops.  He scores on new technologies, he considers himself the best, he considers his methods to be the best, he looks at others with a malicious smile.  He does not like other programmers.  Always trying to prove to others that he is the best!  Often criticizes common acquaintances programmers.  He writes a lot, because you have to prove to yourself that you are the best.  He writes a lot, but does not develop, because he believes that the methods he uses are the best!  Why change something, I write programs, some even people use.  They took me to work.  I am a pro and nobody can compare with me! <br>  The stage is very difficult, difficult because you do not understand what is still on it!  You think that already at the end of the game, you think that you have learned all the secrets of the profession, that there is simply no place to develop further.  You think that you are one of the best, and maybe the best, and do not know that this is only the beginning of your development and that you need to move further.  How to pass the stage, even if you do not know what you are on it!?  Very simple!  We must communicate with other programmers, and look at them not as an opponent, but as a source of experience.  We need to visit programming forums, websites, we need to learn something new, and try to use it!  It is necessary to understand that programming is such a thing that it is impossible to comprehend completely -! <br><h4>  Stage number five: I'm not that cool ... </h4><br>  Not all programmers reach this stage ... At this stage, the programmer rethinks the very concept of "programming".  He begins to listen to other programmers, to pay attention to ready-made solutions, not reinventing the wheel in a new way, the speed and quality of project implementation come to the fore, looking at other people's listings, he searches for interesting ideas, not errors.  His mind opens for the new, he does not criticize, but instructs.  When they criticize him, he does not prove his case, but listens, and if the criticism is constructive and fair, he corrects his mistakes.  A new tab ‚ÄúNovice Programmers‚Äù appears in the ace, and if one of them needs his help, he helps, for as one wise but long-dead person said: ‚ÄúWhen we teach others, we learn ourselves.‚Äù <br><h4>  In custody. </h4><br>  I can‚Äôt write further, I‚Äôm in the fifth stage, and I don‚Äôt even know what's next.  That is what this ‚ÄúProgramming‚Äù game is good for, that we don‚Äôt know what stage will be next, and what difficulties await us at the next turn.  We do not even know what part of the path we are in, the beginning of it, or the middle?  All we know is that it will be more interesting further, and this fact makes us play this amazing game day and night! <br>  Enjoy programming. <br>  Your <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/voff/" class="user_link">voff</a> voff. </div>
