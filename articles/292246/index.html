  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to save on IT infrastructure</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Cloud technologies provide additional <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/1cloud/blog/292184/">opportunities</a> to optimize business processes and improve the overall efficiency of organizations.  In addition to the obvious advantages, there are some difficulties faced by companies starting a ‚Äútransition to the cloud‚Äù: from choosing a specific <a href="https://1cloud.ru/">IaaS provider</a> to revising existing processes within their organization. <br><br> <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/1cloud/blog/292246/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9b0/fd9/321/9b0fd932105548e5b3260438e983754b.jpg"></a> <a name="habracut"></a><br>  <i>/ photo <a href="https://pixabay.com/en/server-cloud-development-business-1235959/">ColossusCloud</a> <a href="">CC0</a></i> <br><br>  Let's try to deal with the main points.

    <h2>  Provider selection </h2><br>  Here it is necessary to take into account a number of factors.  It all starts with a general understanding of the reputation of the company providing these services.  This moment is easy enough to estimate by the fact that specialized publications write about the company and how openly she herself tells about the structure of her data center and the application of certain technologies in work. <br><br>  The second significant moment is the compliance of the IT infrastructure of the IaaS provider with various standards and requirements of security and reliability.  There are many such standards, but here it is enough just to look at whether the company has a common understanding of the current problems faced by the IaaS service provider. <br><br>  She can tell about it in her blog - to evaluate foreign experience, share her opinion and decisions.  In addition to the general analysis of the company's information policy, it is worth looking into the agreement on the guaranteed quality level of the services provided (SLA). <br><br>  The third element is billing.  Resource rental should be carried out on a flexible system, when the customer can only pay for the capacity that he needs at a particular point in time.  This is one of the benefits of IaaS. <br><br>  Fourth - support service.  Problems can arise at different levels - from domestic difficulties with setting up a server to freelance problems.  It would be good to secure the possibility of a round-the-clock contact with the technical support service of the provider in order to feel confident even in a difficult situation. <br><br><h2>  Where is the savings </h2><br>  The trend of cloud technology development is only gaining momentum.  As in the situation with any other innovation, there are opponents of this approach and its evangelists. <br><br>  We are confident that the cloud is a tool that can and should be used to benefit a business.  Of course, it is important to assess not only opportunities, but also potential risks. <br><br>  When we talk about the IaaS-provider, we mean the expertise of dozens of specialists who are faced with the solution of core problems on a daily basis.  It is rather difficult to compare, but in general the situation is obvious - an average company cannot compete in terms of the level of knowledge of specialists with even a relatively new player in the market of IaaS providers. <br><br>  At the same time, most of the business funds with their equipment will be spent on its support and maintenance, and the provider will be able to spend this money on hiring more experienced specialists. <br><br>  In addition, the provider has the ability to minimize costs due to scale.  An ordinary business will have to deploy from 5,000 to 15,000 servers in order to achieve marginal costs comparable to what the IaaS provider has in terms of the server. <br><br>  As a result, IaaS enables business to deal with core issues - specific customer orders and strategic planning, and the cloud service provider assumes all official tasks - he has all the necessary expertise for this. <br><br>  PS Additional materials on the work of <b><a href="https://1cloud.ru/">1cloud</a></b> : <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/1cloud/blog/281889/">How to create a virtual infrastructure provider: Experience 1cloud</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/1cloud/blog/280748/">Client-oriented "cloud": Experience 1cloud</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/1cloud/blog/278479/">Photo tour of the "cloud" of 1cloud</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/1cloud/blog/278055/">A little about data storage and experience 1cloud</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/1cloud/blog/277155/">UI Optimization: Experience 1cloud</a> </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/292246/">https://habr.com/ru/post/292246/</a></p>
