  <section class="page js-page"><h1>exposing small business myths</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <strong>Exposing small business myths</strong> <br><br>  <em>An interesting article on the myths about startups.</em> <br><br>  <strong>The author, Patricia Simone (Patricia Simone), business strategist, lecturer, mentor and writer, is president of Write-Communications.com, a consulting firm specializing in strategic planning, training, and copywriting.</strong>  <strong>She is also the founder of WomenCentric.org, a women's group that develops programs and organizes events dedicated to career and entrepreneurial growth.</strong> <strong><br></strong> <br>  That which seems to you an infallible truth about starting a business can be a lie or a delusion.  Let me help and separate the myths from the reality. <br>  Posted by: Patricia Simone <br>  Many enthusiastic entrepreneurs dream of the numerous incomes and rewards that are waiting for, and when they finally do away with the ‚Äúmouse fuss‚Äù and become their own bosses.  But many people see only a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow and go to it, completely not imagining what it really means to run your own business.  They think that one phone call is enough to find sources of funds, that they will have enough free time for a weekly game of golf and that they will become rich faster than you can say ‚ÄúCh-ching‚Äù. <br>  In order to help you separate myths from reality, we have compiled a list of the ten most common myths about small business.  It includes the most common misconceptions you may face, along with the real state of affairs, so that you can make sensible and informed decisions for your business. <br>  We know that you will be able to cope with all these obstacles, since we have seen thousands of entrepreneurs successfully coped with similar difficulties and created a thriving business.  Our tips will help you overcome some of the most difficult problems that each business owner faces, save your time and health, so that you too can take the lead. <br>  <strong>Myth number 1: ‚ÄúThe government subsidizes new enterprises‚Äù.</strong> <br>  Reality: Nothing could be further from the truth!  The federal government does not have a single program that directly subsidizes any business.  According to Mark Johnson, business development coordinator from the Cabinet of Ministers for Economic Development, Kentucky, the state department is creating jobs and developing entrepreneurship, in some states there may be special funding programs that are targeted at the disabled or disabled. or minorities.  These programs often have very specific requirements for candidates, which must be met in order for a funding application to be accepted for consideration. <br>  Be careful when looking for funding programs on the Internet: there are many companies that claim to be able to assist you in receiving money from the government.  You may doubt any too bold promises that you hear about - if the offer is too good to be true, you may want to abandon it. <br>  Although in each state and each country economic development is approached differently, one of the best and most reliable places where you can get help in any part of the country is the local branch of the Economic Development Corporation (EEC).  They monitor local, regional and even state-wide opportunities for economic development and can offer information and resources that will help both emerging and established businesses. <br>  According to Steven Porath, director of economic development for the KED division in Rockland County, New York, ‚ÄúThere is no single standard layout of economic development divisions, although the goals of all of them are in many ways the same: to help successful development and prosperity of the economic sector in our districts.  Your local branch is a great place to start, because we all work as curators to help people find the right resources for their business. ‚Äù <br>  <a href="http://live.liveidea.ru/%3Fcat%3D9">read more</a> </div>
