  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Time management for the developer</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  When you first start working, everything is clear and understandable, there are not so many tasks, you can imagine how to work with them.  But over time, the thought ‚ÄúI have so many tasks !!!  what to do with them?  what to undertake? ‚Äù, or simply comes the realization that a lot of tasks have accumulated.  In this case, you will help time management. <br><br>  As a rule, for many, it is associated with tight time references and a clear pre-planned plan.  But everyone knows that developers can not be driven into the framework.  Nevertheless, each developer must be able to properly and efficiently organize / plan their working time.  Let's think about how to approach this process. <br><br>  Time management is essentially a set of actions for the training of conscious control over time, through which you can significantly increase your productivity and efficiency.

      How to approach this process?  I like the approach in agile development methodologies.  Why do developers like them so much?  I think that the fact that they can be customized.  The main idea from which I propose to proceed is a set of rules, while everyone can choose from them those that suit him, can be supplemented, based on their needs. <br><br>  In this article I will try to formulate the rules to which I came to myself during my work, looking at what would be useful for me and the members of my team. <br><br>  To begin, consider the basic idea of ‚Äã‚Äãtime management.  That is, take something that does not frighten the developer. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The principle that must be put in the basis - the compilation of a list of tasks.  Look at your tasks and put a priority on each and how much time you think to spend on it (yes, you need to be able to estimate the time costs correctly, but this is a separate topic).  If you have too many tasks, then consider by what criterion you can reduce the list of tasks in question.  For example, you can only select tasks for the nearest version of the fix, only tasks for the current sprint (if you are working on Scrum), and so on.  And it is with this list and worth working. <br><br>  So, all the list of things divided into 4 groups: <br>  Urgent and important; <br>  Important, but not urgent; <br>  Urgent, but unimportant; <br>  Not urgent and unimportant. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/713/077/082/713077082d5e417800488796b0c031f0.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  Now we will put down the time for each task, which we will spend on its solution.  And, remembering that we have only 8 working hours a day, we will make a list of tasks for today.  This is <b>rule 1</b> .  Unlike the time management position that the list is worth making the night before, I think you need to make this list as soon as you come to work.  That is, at the beginning of the working day.  In my opinion, at this moment you more clearly understand the state of affairs.  The night before you can make notes what you would like to do tomorrow. <br>  So you will see in front of you AIM. <br><br>  <b>Rule 2</b> <br>  It is very important that you have to plan all tasks on the basis of making them exactly on a working day.  No more.  Do not plan on working overtime unless absolutely necessary.  This will only lead to fatigue.  It is better to spend your free time on self-development and reading professional literature. <br><br>  <b>Rule 3</b> <br>  Do not forget to take into account that you have clean workers in less than 8 hours.  It is necessary to take into account the time for breaks, physical rest.  The developer does not have to sit at the computer all the time.  Plan that at least 15 minutes every two hours you will expel yourself, get up and just walk and air.  At the same time, work efficiency will only grow.  This will help, without losing pace, to have time to do something that I could not have done without rest. <br>  BUT, no need to abuse.  You can spend a maximum of half an hour on a break, otherwise the brain relaxes too much and the working attitude is lost. <br><br>  <b>Rule 4</b> <br>  This list should include not only important and long-term tasks, but also easy, quick ones, so that you can switch attention and relax to them.  For the developer, this is extremely important.  Tasks can be performed in any order, but nevertheless it is recommended to start with important ones.  And be sure to start with those that least want to do. <br><br>  <b>Rule 4 *</b> <br>  Set the time limit for solving the problem.  If you are to no avail (precisely to no avail!), Sit on the task for more than 2 hours, then it is time to switch to another task.  In your list there are such tasks in the category of simple ones.  We have them specifically for this and included. <br><br>  If you promise yourself that you will dedicate today to a particular task for no more than an hour or two, it will be much easier to start working with it.  It also makes sense to brainstorm, attract colleagues. <br><br>  <b>Rule 5</b> <br>  Make a list of the minimum and the list of the maximum.  The minimum list must be fulfilled.  In addition, when doing it, you will feel satisfied with yourself.  The maximum list is needed if there is time.  If you did not have your minimum program, then you misjudge your strength, you need to approach this more carefully. <br><br>  If you have learned to carry out the list at least and you have some days left in a row for a list at most, then it's time to increase the list at least.  And yes, again - look again why you misjudged the time for the tasks. <br><br>  <b>Rule 6</b> <br>  Fix somewhere list: on paper or in the electronic version.  But so that he was in front of your eyes.  This will help to see how much has been done and how much is left.  You will also receive emotional satisfaction when you cross out the next task from the list, and this will give additional motivation.  Therefore, it is very important to delete the tasks, not delete them. <br><br>  <b>Rule 7</b> <br>  Schedule time for force majeure.  As Murphy's law says, ‚Äúif something can happen, then it will definitely happen.‚Äù  As a rule, developers feel such moments. <br><br>  Now we will consider work with heavy tasks.  Those that for some reason seem to us very heavy.  Like sunrise on Everest.  They frighten us either by the fact that we do not know how to approach such a task, or we do not want to communicate with its author / customer.  The next few rules are about such tasks. <br><br>  <b>Rule 8</b> <br>  If you have a very heavy task, for which you do not want to accept or do not know how to evaluate, then it should be the first on your list.  This is a potential black hole and may be unresolvable for you (you will need the help of another, attract it) or it is too time consuming, which means that you simply do not have time to do it.  Start with it, return to it during the day, until it becomes clear to you, try to break it down into smaller ones. <br>  It may also help just to tell someone from colleagues about the task, to display it on the board, or even just to tell aloud about the problem. <br>  As soon as you want to postpone the task for tomorrow, it is a sign to do it right now. <br><br>  A small life hack: try to complete the tasks so that if you still have this overwhelming task, then it is the only one.  Otherwise, you will not be satisfied and there will be a hang on one this task and a number of unfulfilled others. <br><br>  <b>Rule 9</b> <br>  If you need concentration, use turbo mode.  It really works.  To do this, for a certain time, turn off all communication devices (skype, icq, etc.), put a sign so that you are not distracted, put on headphones and do not react to anything.  In these 25 minutes, you only do one specific task.  Do not be distracted by anything.  The main thing is not to abuse it, especially in large companies.  ‚ÄúTomato‚Äù should be required a maximum of 2-3 times a day. <br><br>  In the work of each developer is important motivation.  This, of course, is a separate topic, but contributes to the implementation of the list.  Therefore, the following few rules are devoted to it. <br><br>  <b>Rule 10</b> <br>  Motivate yourself.  Motivation is also part of the work on yourself.  After seeing something motivating, do not forget about it in five minutes, save and return to this for an additional dose of motivation.  Let it be a photo of Steve Jobs, or your child, for whom you want to become better, or even a song that helps you work. <br><br>  <b>Rule 11</b> <br>  Music can also motivate.  And help to concentrate.  Choose for yourself such playlists.  However, do not constantly sit in the headphones.  Spend time and colleagues.  There is also an opinion that noise sounds help to concentrate: the sound of a train or a flight. <br><br>  <b>Rule 12</b> <br>  Set yourself goals.  Yes, they should be some in the style of ‚Äútoday I will make the list a minimum‚Äù or ‚Äútoday I will do this task necessarily‚Äù.  It is important to strive for something.  Always strive for something.  Think about what the solution of your task will lead to in the future, how to reflect on the work of the program, what will give the user.  Present the big picture how the product will work if you complete the task and if not. <br><br>  <b>Rules 13 and 14</b> <br>  What you probably already knew: be sure to get enough sleep before work and do not overeat at lunch.  This leads to laziness, which is bad for work. <br><br>  In conclusion, I want to give the two most effective ways of motivation, in my opinion. <br><br>  <u>The first is</u> illustrated by Artemy Lebedev‚Äôs phrase ‚ÄúHow to maintain motivation?  No way - stay in the ass. " <br><br>  <u>The second</u> is to do nothing.  In the literal sense of ANYTHING.  Because when we start to be lazy, we read articles on the Internet, watch videos on youtube, correspond with someone, etc.  Therefore, in its essence, our laziness is useless actions. <br><br>  How does this work?  You decide (or, better, write down on paper) what time you will start this business and how much time you will be occupied with.  Let's say you start to do the task.  Let it be, for example, 11:00.  At 11:00 you start to struggle with laziness, namely, to do nothing.  That is, you stop doing anything at all.  Just sit or stand.  Do not lie, it will lead the body to sleep.  Soon you will feel that you can take on the task. <br><br>  If during work you again feel an attack of laziness - again stop doing something.  And soon again return to a healthy state. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/259293/">https://habr.com/ru/post/259293/</a></p>
