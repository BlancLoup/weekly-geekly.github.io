They are all praised, but not so simple.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ko/iy/ni/koiyniy9hrx4m2-b6vixkgnabts.jpeg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In general, we should start by saying that it was we who once <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/399407/">warned you against buying</a> ‚Äúreal wireless‚Äù headphones.  It was the end of 2016, and by that time this niche was just beginning to emerge, the first samples and the first mistakes appeared. <br><br>  The main one is a complete rassinhron on the street.  Bluetooth of all early models could work stably only indoors.  The idea, however, did not kill it, then Apple emerged, where (at that time) for the first time no such problem was discovered.  And wrap everything up ... And everything has turned to thousands of models by now. <br><br>  In Russia, <a href="https://medgadgets.ru/shop/besprovodnye-naushniki-cgpods-bluetooth-earphone-chernye.html%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dcgpods%26utm_campaign%3Dcgpods">Case Guru Pods has</a> been actively promoted since the end of the year. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ab/ge/ou/abgeou-wkj5rvo0jayemhxfyhjq.jpeg"><br><br>  In general, the world, of course, is going crazy, in the sense that after reviewing the mass of reviews on this product, we noticed that almost no one characterizes them in terms of sound, except that the general phrases from the ‚Äúpronounced bass line‚Äù and ‚Äú the sound is no worse than in the Air Pods. ‚Äù <br><br>  Headphones now somehow become more accepted as an accessory in the categories of "convenience", "autonomy", "practicality", "price".  There is a certain logic here: if you want to enjoy music, sit in a chair, pour wine, enjoy, and if you want something to play on the background on the way to work, choose something convenient. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jj/t8/4u/jjt84uljorcxbfmgboki0-zawhw.jpeg"><br><br>  And now we have only one convenient category - headphones completely devoid of wires.  And from this point of view, CG Pods are quite adequate for themselves. <br><br>  Unlike the direct clones of Apple, the form of the first Samsung IconX was taken as a basis, which is much more convenient from the ‚Äúfit in the ears‚Äù point of view.  Headphones out of the box have an additional gum, which is designed to strengthen their position in the ear. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ya/hq/hw/yahqhwugbdfdtnzbkahunuza5am.jpeg"><br><br>  Like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/y4/vs/yr/y4vsyrdprxf1ujct15ubi_alhvc.jpeg"><br><br>  However, it is much more convenient (in our opinion) to abandon it and use a small gum embouchure. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/nk/oa/3n/nkoa3nigbhthevitb7i_eewyjge.jpeg"><br><br><blockquote>  It is worth saying that such an elastic band is also responsible for sealing, protection from dust / splashes, so that if you remove it, then there is a risk that excess elements will fall inside the headphones.  Under the rubber band - right place the coupling of the two halves of the body. </blockquote><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/8n/3g/xe/8n3gxe0eh2jwgj7qshobfuou2fu.jpeg"><br><br>  In general, they are constructively convenient, do not fly out of the ears, sit comfortably - this is all true.  Sometimes you have to correct them (in my case - like any headphones), and there is a trick here - touch control.  That is, for example, if you try to push them deeper inside, poking into the body there is a risk of stopping playback, but you get used to it. <br><br>  The touch control has its pros and cons, in general.  But you quickly adapt to it - several scenarios: <br><br>  <b>Call</b> <br><br><ul><li>  Only one earphone is active during a call. </li><li>  With an incoming call - a short press takes the call, rejects a long </li><li>  Double click to dial the last number </li><li>  During a call - short press disconnects </li></ul><br>  <b>Music</b> <br><br><ul><li>  Short press - play / pause </li><li>  Hold for a second - new track </li><li>  Double tap - volume up </li></ul><br>  That is, for example, by pushing the earpiece carelessly into your ear, you can pause the playback. <br><br>  With the connection, too, in general, there were no problems: everything is according to the classics - a long hold, alternately flickering lights and Bluetooth settings on the smartphone. <br><br>  <b>Equipment</b> <br><br>  Headphones are available in two colors: <a href="https://medgadgets.ru/shop/besprovodnye-naushniki-cgpods-bluetooth-earphone-belye.html%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dcgpods%26utm_campaign%3Dcgpods">white</a> and <a href="https://medgadgets.ru/shop/besprovodnye-naushniki-cgpods-bluetooth-earphone-chernye.html%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dcgpods%26utm_campaign%3Dcgpods">black</a> .  They are delivered with a case, which is for them both a docking station and a pilot bank. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jq/5p/e3/jq5pe3vkhv4112xxaxwnki1sdas.gif"><br><br>  He has a rather pleasant mechanism that ensures that the headphones do not fall out.  On the one hand, there is even a special place for attaching the lace to carry the case around the neck. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/is/gx/gy/isgxgygatxip4bsita0qhm9qeg0.jpeg"><br><br>  On the other hand - cable connector: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/o6/el/ka/o6elkatrgy6tzjssivnmgikzxa4.jpeg"><br><br>  At the same time, when the case is open, the headphones also do not fall apart right away: a magnetic mount at a decent level. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ts/dy/sc/tsdyscq3pqkd9smjqsbte3sxb7u.gif"><br><br>  The capacity of the built-in battery 2 * 55 mAh + two or three times more can be charged from the case on the road (450 mAh). <br><br>  Headphones are equipped with silicone ear cushions of different sizes, additional attachments just in case, and a microUSB cable. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/cw/yv/qn/cwyvqnlvpquvdjutjjsuskwbowa.jpeg"><br><br>  <b>Sound</b> <br><br>  Given that the headphones belong to the class of "city", and even "sports", then during the running around the city there is no time to present any claims to the sound.  At the same time, the sound in reality is quite decent and loud.  In any case, there are no complaints about the music of those genres that we usually listen to. <br><br>  At the same time one of the key features that can be traced in each review, and rendered on the box is the "deep and rich" bass.  For noise insulation - depends heavily on the ears, but the outside world is not very distracting. <br><br>  <b>Headphones for music only</b> <br><br>  In general, it is strange, but of all the reviews that have been reviewed and watched, few have touched this, but the delay in playing is obvious, in other words, mobile shooters, watching movies and videos on YouTube is not a direct pleasure.  Some, however, "watching" the same YouTube without a video, against the background, but that is, that is. <br><br>  And now actually the title - where could they? <br><br>  <b>Bluetooth 4.2</b> <br><br>  Headphones are connected via Bluetooth 4.2, and - oh, a miracle - they keep the connection stable on the street.  Listened to IOS / Android.  At the same time, the smartphone alternately visited all the pockets - from the inside in the jacket, to the back pockets of the trousers, but I must pay tribute never to CG Pods who stammered and did not lose connections in open areas (Iphone 7 / OnePlus 6). <br><br>  This is very decent for headphones of this price category and, in general, even in 2018 (for the first time they came into our hands last year), this can be recognized as an achievement. <br><br>  <b>What is the result</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/mb/mj/tf/mbmjtfd48jzyc4vx91f2meiaft4.jpeg"><br><br>  It's nice that the TWS niche lives and develops, bugs are fixed and normal stable devices appear that can be listened to without horror.  In terms of sound and sync.  CG Pods is a decent city headset with an average autonomy in the classroom and an understandable price - up to 5 thousand rubles. <br><br>  The design is simple, but comfortable, it sits quite tightly in the ears and with dynamic walking nothing falls out and does not lag behind.  Management on the go is clear and simple.  Actually, <b>one of the most important parameters</b> , which we considered to be an obstacle to the massive use of TWS, is brought to mind here, which already highlights CG Pods in a niche and cannot but rejoice. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">For those who want to buy - as usual there are discounts</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Headphones are in <a href="https://medgadgets.ru/shop/besprovodnye-naushniki-cgpods-bluetooth-earphone-chernye.html%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dcgpods%26utm_campaign%3Dcgpods">black</a> and <a href="https://medgadgets.ru/shop/besprovodnye-naushniki-cgpods-bluetooth-earphone-belye.html%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dcgpods%26utm_campaign%3Dcgpods">white</a> colors.  Until the end of March, every model has a 15% discount on the coupon: <b>CGPODS15</b> . <br></div></div><br>  Thank you all for your attention! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/444188/">https://habr.com/ru/post/444188/</a></p>
