  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Why you should not promote bad sites</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Quite often, I find myself in the following situation: a client comes in and asks to calculate how much search engine promotion in a certain topic will cost.  I think I report the price range, I get the consent of the client.  And everything would be fine, but here‚Äôs just the site itself is a complete G. In principle, I can even promote such a site, but I refuse to do it.  That's why‚Ä¶ <a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>What is a "bad site"</b> <br><br>  This, in my opinion, includes the ‚Äúbad site‚Äù (in decreasing order of importance): <br><br><ul><li>  Inconvenient navigation and wrong site structure.  Difficult or ambiguous wording in menus and headings.  JavaScript errors, 404 and just pages with the words ‚ÄúUnder development‚Äù; </li><li>  Bad layout.  It is especially annoying when even indents are not made from the normal edge of the page.  About horizontal scrolling and "shoals", crawling out in different browsers generally keep quiet; </li><li>  Unsuccessful color range, which complicates the perception of information: black (red, green) background under the text;  insufficiently contrast color of the text;  use of more than 3 primary colors, etc .; </li><li>  Poor-quality graphics - from ‚Äúclasped‚Äù photos and standard images from Word to poor buttons and bright shadows; </li><li>  Unsuccessful fonts in the text, titles, menus.  Long texts, not broken into paragraphs.  Lack of lists where they could greatly facilitate the perception of the text; </li><li>  Lack or excess of information (as a whole on the website, and on each individual page in particular); </li><li>  Stylistic and spelling errors in the texts.  Brazen use of other people's texts. </li></ul><br>  <b>Why I refuse to promote "bad sites"</b>

    <ul><li>  The effectiveness of such a site is very low.  As a result, its owner will receive much less profit than he could, and will not appreciate my work (maybe even will soon refuse my services, since they are not cheap, but ‚Äúnot enough of them‚Äù); </li><li>  You will not wait for help from such a client: the texts will not be provided, it will not give you money for a paid registration in Yak, additional links from the sites of friends are also unlikely.  On the site itself, such a client usually does not care - ‚ÄúDo whatever you like, so long as there are calls‚Äù; </li><li>  It will hardly be pleasant to work with such a client.  If he has such a site, then he is either very greedy, or does not understand anything at all on the Internet (since he accepted such a site from the developer); </li><li>  Surely the site will have to completely rewrite, rewrite non-unique texts, correct multiple errors - otherwise it will be very difficult to promote.  Natural updates are also not foreseen - you will have to invent news, write articles to the site; </li><li>  "Slip" people in the search results obviously bad site really do not want.  It would be desirable not only to earn money, but also to bring benefits, and not make life difficult for others. </li></ul><br>  <b>What to do?</b> <br><br>  There are 3 options for the development of events in this situation: <br><br><ol><li>  For an additional fee to fix the site or completely redo it. <br>  That is what I do now.  Directly pointing to all the flaws.  I don‚Äôt go down to muddling the developer, I try to speak neutrally: ‚ÄúIt looks bad, the text is unreadable, navigation is illogical.‚Äù  A strong argument is that I refuse to promote even for good money, because I consider such a site to be ineffective.  Most importantly, I do not set goals to make money by creating a site.  I earn on promotion.  I just want to promote a normal site that will not scare visitors, will be effective; </li><li>  Free to fix the site in the process of promotion. <br>  I did it before.  I do it now, but not in the most difficult cases (if I see that the client is adequate and will appreciate my efforts).  I can offer a new structure, correct navigation, make normal fonts, indents, headers.  At the same time, I am not a designer, so I practically do not work with graphics.  Of course, I can attract our full-time designer and not demand money from the client for this, but this is only in case of extreme sympathy for the latter :) </li><li>  Deny to the customer. <br>  If you do not have the necessary knowledge, there is no familiar web designer, or simply do not want to mess with the development - deny the customer.  Let him first make a normal site, then take up the promotion.  You can recommend him some familiar design studio and get for it% of the order.  But that's another story ... </li></ol><br>  Dear colleagues, let's not promote shit!  At least try to convince your customers to make their sites a little better.  Well, you can earn some money on this! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/21171/">https://habr.com/ru/post/21171/</a></p>
