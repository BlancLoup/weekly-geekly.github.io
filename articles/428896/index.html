  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Neural networks against hentai censorship</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/9x/op/f_/9xopf__beuw-41amoqw4lby6yx4.png"></p><br><blockquote>  From the translator: This funny repository has <a href="">been</a> in the <a href="https://github.com/explore">trends of the githaba</a> for a week now, and now it has an enchanting amount of 5000 stars and 400 forks - so I thought it would be interesting to translate the article about it, although it is short, and the theme for Habr is not very standard. <br>  If interested, the original article (link near the title) has links to examples of the program. </blockquote><a name="habracut"></a><br><p>  In Japan, pornographic images with penises and vaginas are considered illegal.  Since the early 1980s, hundreds of people have been arrested for distributing similar materials online. </p><br><p>  In order to circumvent this prohibition, artists who paint hentai (pornographic anime and manga genre) usually paint small stripes or blur where there is forbidden content.  It turns out that the authors often put a lot of effort into images of the genitals that will never see the light in Japan (translator's note: yes, that‚Äôs what it sounds in the original). </p><br><p>  In order to restore the images, the machine learning researcher under the name ‚ÄúDeeppomf‚Äù wrote an algorithm that uses neural networks to circumvent censorship.  He called his program DeepCreamPy. </p><br><p>  Anyone can download the code and try this program - it has gained great fame on Reddit, and some posted the same images that they got as a result of processing.  Over the week, the program scored over 500 downloads. </p><br><p>  At the moment, DeepCreamPy can remove censorship in the illustrations with penises and vaginas.  She is not yet working on videos, nipples and anus.  Before launching the program, the user just needs to mark in green the corresponding zone on the image. </p><br><p>  Deeppomf wrote to me in an email that the creation of DeepCreamPy is the answer to decades of censorship by the Japanese government.  Article 175 of the Penal Code of Japan prohibits the distribution of ‚Äúobscene‚Äù materials (and hentai clearly falls into this category) and requires that pornography be at least partially painted over with black stripes or blurred mosaics. </p><br><p>  ‚ÄúDeepCreamPy is designed to counteract increasing censorship,‚Äù said Deeppomf.  ‚ÄúThe Japanese government, especially the Supreme Court of Japan, shows that they are not going to soften their demands.  So change must come from the outside. ‚Äù </p><br><p>  He began to think about the project in the summer of 2016, but he says that he was not the first to use neural networks to remove censorship. </p><br><p>  ‚ÄúBut I was the first who was motivated enough to implement this idea, skillful enough to collect data and train the neural network, and not career-oriented enough to work on something that would fit my resume better.‚Äù - he added as well. </p><br><p>  In just a few months, Deeppomf collected a sample of more than 100,000 uncensored, uncensored images to train the algorithm.  The sample includes yaoi, yuri, feet, and ‚Äúother fetishes,‚Äù as he said.  Gouraud and faecal pornography were not included in the sample, as they could lead to undesirable results. </p><br><p>  ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt collect my own porn collection, so my personal attachments don't matter.  I didn‚Äôt see more than 95 percent of the images, because studying each would be too long, ‚Äùcommented Deeppomf. </p><br><p>  So far, the algorithm does not always produce correct results - at least in those examples provided by users - the black bars are removed quite easily, but there are problems with mosaics.  However, Deeppomf continues to improve the algorithm, and also wants to add a new interface and the ability to work with black and white images. </p><br><p>  ‚ÄúArtificial intelligence has just begun to penetrate the porn industry,‚Äù says Deeppomf.  "It's only the beginning". </p><br><h3 id="ssylki">  Links </h3><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://github.com/deeppomf/DeepCreamPy">Project repository</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/9sc0qj/deepcreampy_decensoring_hentai_with_deep_neural/">Thread on reddit</a> </li><li>  The image of the mermaid in the example is taken from the Shurajo &amp; AVALANCHE Game Studio, the original is published under the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">CC BY 3.0 License</a> and is located <a href="https://opengameart.org/content/mermaid">here</a> . </li></ul></div>
