  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Open interface for Hive: we made it</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <b>Hive Cloud PBX gets an open interface for connecting the IP-telephony platform to other information systems.</b> <br><br>  Cloud PBX and IP telephony provide a new level of flexibility for organizing call processing and call management.  However, the possibilities of modern communication technologies are not fully disclosed if there is no constant interaction between PBX and other information systems of the company. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Let us give an example: the employee of the Call-center works in the CRM-system - absolutely any and from any manufacturer.  He receives an incoming call and starts processing it.  If there is no additional integration, he will see only the number or even the subscriber ID on his phone screen, and with the configured interaction between the virtual PBX and the CRM system, all known customer data may appear on the screen - name, interaction history, active contracts, etc. .  It is therefore not surprising that we at Hive set out to create an open API library that would allow us to customize the interaction of IP telephony with any other information system.

      <b>Three Whales API Architecture</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e75/a1b/e4c/e75a1be4c837409889734e0b05daca27.png"><br><br>  Without plunging immediately into a detailed description of the functions and capabilities of the new interface, we note its main features, including those that distinguish us from other cloud telephony platforms.  The API uses standard GET or POST methods, allowing you to operate on data or upload files, including call recordings and faxes, work with call history, initiate calls, and much more.  At the same time, the connection is made via an encrypted TLS-channel, using the private key, which can be obtained in the personal account of the Hive service client.  By the way, the Hive portal itself addresses the cloud PBX through this API in order to upload files, initiate calls, inform the user about events (when you see how beautifully the lights in your account blink - this is it). <br><br>  To support the maximum number of possibilities, our API contains three subsystems.  The first one, REST, provides data on request.  The second, WEB-HOOK - transfers data to your platform, for example, to report that a conversation has ended.  Third, WEBSOCKETS - allows you to configure continuous interaction between the cloud PBX and external information system. <br><br>  In fact, we have already considered the first example when we talked about a contact center employee, but in fact the transfer of data about calls can have much wider application.  For example, one of our customers wanted to create a script that creates a table of incoming calls with all their parameters: subscriber number, duration, waiting time, and so on.  Having an open API allowed to do this very quickly.  Similarly, you can easily get the unloading of all calls from the database for each subscriber, you just need to make a request. <br><br>  The second aspect is the integration of IP telephony into various information systems, including CRM, web portals and other corporate software, where you can use the "call button", listen to the recordings of conversations, and it also makes sense to analyze the call history, for example, for a specific client or a certain deal.  Simple instructions allow you to introduce the possibility of initiating a call from almost anywhere, using both direct dialing and a call based on the available data about the client, partner, and contractor.  For ease of programming, we developed a ready-made class in PHP with our own methods, and now the call to Hive functions occurs according to a standard, documented scheme. <br><br>  But we could not rest on our laurels and went beyond the standard functions.  Thanks to this, the Hive API also has the ability to connect to the cloud PBX via websockets.  This subsystem significantly expands the possibilities of integration, allowing you to connect telephony to various applications on an ongoing basis.  The websockets interface allows you to respond to events in real time.  For example, the application will immediately receive information that the subscriber rang the phone, the handset was picked up, the phone became unavailable, and so on.  Each event can definitely trigger an action, including operator notification, card display, request for additional information, etc.  Moreover, further expansion of API capabilities is expected in the near future. <br><br>  <b>Single Ecosystem</b> <br><br>  When using minimal programming (to add new functions to your system, you can use the ready-made PHP class), Hive communication services can be integrated into an existing or new software ecosystem with maximum effect and at minimal cost.  In particular, on the basis of the new API, integration with the popular AMOCRM system has already been implemented.  For AMO, we made a customer card ascent, automatically create transactions and save the contact, and attached a recording of the conversation to the transaction.  All this is done using our API. <br><br>  What is all this done for?  Using simple API methods, which are <a href="http://hive.zeonpbx.ru/">described in</a> detail <a href="http://hive.zeonpbx.ru/">on the site</a> , allows you to create a single information space for your services and information systems.  And this, in turn, leads to increased efficiency of business processes, allows you to work with greater comfort, spend less time and money on communication, using them to the fullest. <br><br>  For reference <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ <a href="https://iptelefon.su/">IPtelefon</a> is a communications service provider, system integrator and developer of innovative telecommunications solutions. <br>  ‚Ä¢ <a href="http://hive.zeonpbx.ru/">Hive -</a> cloud PBX for business. <br>  ‚Ä¢ <a href="http://zeonpbx.ru/">ZeON</a> is a communications server that comes in the form of a boxed solution with extensive configuration options. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/299490/">https://habr.com/ru/post/299490/</a></p>
