The results, of course, will be at the end of the review. <br> <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/rRY6G_zzDtRVhF1XxAHfVUlg2eXU6E1J-xlQiJeAViQ%3Ffeat%3Dembedwebsite"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d9b/ec6/750/d9bec675087097924b34efce430c4c80.jpg"></a> <br>  In our century of advanced smartphones and tablets, its characteristics look quite pale if they (characteristics, of course) would not be robed in a durable case, whose protection (as promised by the Chinese) is <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_(%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D1%258C_%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B0%25D1%2589%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D1%258B_%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D1%2587%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8)">IP67</a> certified - in simple terms, this is complete dust protection and protection against immersion in water. <br>  Screen 1.8 ", with a resolution of 176 x 220 (yes, makes you recall the Siemens CX65), GSM, one SIM card, 1.4MB of memory (which, however, compensates for the memory card slot), 1.3M camera (lying 0.3M there ), BT. Battery, really happy - 2000mAh. <br>  Interesting? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Packaging <br></h4>  The phone arrives in such a funny box with the inscription L / \ ND RCVER. <br> <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/ou3y61b7AN2gOjKRk7R7jklg2eXU6E1J-xlQiJeAViQ%3Ffeat%3Dembedwebsite"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1be/b4a/660/1beb4a660d07c15f86be9c54f9cf72ba.jpg" height="481" width="640"></a> <br>  Apparently, this should mean the original inscription LAND ROVER.  It is noteworthy that of all the symbolism, the Chinese made styling only for the logo on the box, the logos in all other places remained original. <br>  The box is sick with a standard illness - the delicate soul of the rough circulation of the Russian post could not stand it, and it was a little torn.  The box itself is quite presentable, and if it were not for damage to the role of the gift it would fit perfectly (of course, along with the contents). <br> <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/lkyPaQZRrG6o-Lz4o4eGdElg2eXU6E1J-xlQiJeAViQ%3Ffeat%3Dembedwebsite"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9b9/b28/7eb/9b9b287eb65f10683f28dd5805f1b1b1.jpg" height="480" width="640"></a> <br>  Inside, too, everything is beautiful - every little thing in a separate bag, the phone on the lodgement of plastic (albeit thin).  If you have a familiar packer, you can get the phone in a dense cardboard box, which will protect its insides from inappropriate treatment. <br>  <b>Packaging on: 4 points out of 10</b> <br>  Nice box, but the mail has spoiled everything. <br><br><h4>  Equipment <br></h4>  Actually, the usual. <br> <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/peq7CYftvwOWhwCur-NS10lg2eXU6E1J-xlQiJeAViQ%3Ffeat%3Dembedwebsite"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f97/849/ba4/f97849ba41a6eeeeee12105ad60e6275.jpg" height="480" width="640"></a> <br>  Phone, battery, charging from the network, cable, headphones, "user manual", screwdriver for screws. <br>  Impressive battery: <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/SCHf86fMUHPx5by8G65E4klg2eXU6E1J-xlQiJeAViQ%3Ffeat%3Dembedwebsite"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/41c/a9c/b1c/41ca9cb1c8aaadf4fd54818eb4f517bb.jpg" height="481" width="640"></a> <br>  Micro USB Connector (Is the charge standard just around the corner?) <br> <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/voeN48aruCys97-3m-IN4Elg2eXU6E1J-xlQiJeAViQ%3Ffeat%3Dembedwebsite"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/523/d9c/e2b/523d9ce2b04a437c17914979d10960ee.jpg" height="480" width="640"></a> <br>  Chinese quality headphones: <br> <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/5vKVU0jZ79H9Hz3v1KGDqklg2eXU6E1J-xlQiJeAViQ%3Ffeat%3Dembedwebsite"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/eff/b80/859/effb80859ad19cc79bd0916231dc3e3a.jpg" height="480" width="640"></a> <br>  More precisely, the headset.  Not broke in the first hour of work - already good. <br>  Metal plate that acts as a screwdriver: <br> <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/iW1rsfdnQRcZMB3uWKjIy0lg2eXU6E1J-xlQiJeAViQ%3Ffeat%3Dembedwebsite"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/147/431/a78/147431a783347b357da1c27c09506a00.jpg" height="481" width="640"></a> <br>  The back cover of the phone is bolted, so without a screwdriver it will be difficult to even install the battery to get started. <br>  Well, where do without it: <br> <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/avXhYV64GS3htM4VM-Dbzklg2eXU6E1J-xlQiJeAViQ%3Ffeat%3Dembedwebsite"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1b1/98d/4ad/1b198d4ad0539239d5783e995f664c93.jpg" height="482" width="640"></a> <br>  Otherwise, how do we understand how to use it: <br> <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/TNgn3evagVTh_xBt0kl1j0lg2eXU6E1J-xlQiJeAViQ%3Ffeat%3Dembedwebsite"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3b7/c98/82c/3b7c9882c1b72c0989792cd8250eaf41.jpg" height="480" width="640"></a> <br>  Chinese guarantee (no, really, I don't know why they print it): <br> <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/X4j8ySdKWyTakTKGxl0Mr0lg2eXU6E1J-xlQiJeAViQ%3Ffeat%3Dembedwebsite"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4a0/44e/01f/4a044e01f7a7d6d8a85ad6e46b70c77a.jpg" height="480" width="640"></a> <br>  <b>Options on: 5 points out of 10</b> <br>  Not "in the bag, wrapped with adhesive tape," but not the top grade.

    <h4>  Build quality and appearance <br></h4> <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/sI56lAHq5e3SeEjfcUQT_0lg2eXU6E1J-xlQiJeAViQ%3Ffeat%3Dembedwebsite"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e38/b34/c60/e38b34c6088fd792a6e785d6848adee6.jpg" height="481" width="640"></a> <br>  Appearance - rubber bricks.  So we write.  Quite weighty, quick, due to rubber sidewalls (black inserts), does not even think to slip out of hands, even when wet and dirty.  Whether you want to keep him that way is another question. <br> <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/YuZZwWr-9vnxMER9Vw-ob0lg2eXU6E1J-xlQiJeAViQ%3Ffeat%3Dembedwebsite"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/333/d43/819/333d4381941d91e44c7c540a971db241.jpg" height="481" width="640"></a> <br>  The test for the creaking of the case (an attempt to ‚Äúsqueeze‚Äù the phone) he passed with distinction.  As I did not try to squeeze at least one sound out of it, trying to twist and bend in the most diverse directions, nothing happened.  Monolith.  Well, the brick is so strange? <br> <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/cnxanRAmN54rJcNfGwAGpElg2eXU6E1J-xlQiJeAViQ%3Ffeat%3Dembedwebsite"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/83d/53a/933/83d53a933d4d61932546bd36c7597e3e.jpg" height="480" width="640"></a> <br>  Charging connectors and headsets are covered with a rubber cap.  Despite the fact that it is tight enough not to miss the water and dust, you can take it out with minimal effort, which, in my opinion, is not very good. <br>  The classic keyboard for phones of this type is a membrane + rubber pad. <br> <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/aY3zou4n_ZQQKUhWfxikZ0lg2eXU6E1J-xlQiJeAViQ%3Ffeat%3Dembedwebsite"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/97c/9d9/600/97c9d9600a8b9eed8a651cbd32997746.jpg" height="481" width="640"></a> <br>  Pads on buttons made of the same material as the sidewalls are protected by sides at the edges.  Honestly, the meaning of this decision has not reached me - there is no limiter, it rests directly on the button on the board, therefore any bounce can rip the button off the board, and it‚Äôs good if without a piece of tracks.  The bumpers, if the button were recessed below their level, would have saved.  But they barely reach the middle of the lining. <br> <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/GuuR217tsQWHoAqeP3N_LUlg2eXU6E1J-xlQiJeAViQ%3Ffeat%3Dembedwebsite"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e8f/231/c03/e8f231c0369ab278afa1d8d0c4165818.jpg" height="480" width="640"></a> <br>  On the reverse side there is a back cover, a speaker hole (with double protection - film and mesh), a camera eye and an LED flash, which is the same.  flashlight. <br> <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/EWWFowj92BTAupOFA9_wpUlg2eXU6E1J-xlQiJeAViQ%3Ffeat%3Dembedwebsite"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e40/9b5/fb7/e409b5fb75fd521f0350df3ae60a316c.jpg" height="480" width="640"></a> <br>  Using a screwdriver from the kit, you can unscrew the two screws on the battery compartment ... <br> <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/uEZc2nDaxAd31G0wrRkB6klg2eXU6E1J-xlQiJeAViQ%3Ffeat%3Dembedwebsite"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8ae/a4c/8d4/8aea4c8d495b40bca97a020e11eef316.jpg" height="480" width="640"></a> <br>  ... and remove the back cover. <br> <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/MTXUYoHAnOGl1XPG9RQSLklg2eXU6E1J-xlQiJeAViQ%3Ffeat%3Dembedwebsite"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0d0/d43/b20/0d0d43b20943f4bac700f6d498005c0c.jpg" height="481" width="640"></a> <br>  Along the perimeter is a gasket made of silicone, which prevents the penetration of moisture into the case. <br> <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/BLLONfFNY_5frs1xP0HI_0lg2eXU6E1J-xlQiJeAViQ%3Ffeat%3Dembedwebsite"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/067/657/d71/067657d71d51ab5d56a47c73dc8ff568.jpg" height="481" width="640"></a> <br>  The second gasket is in the recess of the case: <br> <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/h-aKYLGMaQwrc4Uooxs02Ulg2eXU6E1J-xlQiJeAViQ%3Ffeat%3Dembedwebsite"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/eba/10a/0df/eba10a0dfb04c8486ac237c442167332.jpg" height="481" width="640"></a> <br>  Consider stickers.  Here Land Rover is already written correctly, as in the logo above the screen. <br> <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/W69X5RZ13GHdLuVsKzNzN0lg2eXU6E1J-xlQiJeAViQ%3Ffeat%3Dembedwebsite"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4fb/7c4/ed4/4fb7c4ed41455262d8c447c28aa3d631.jpg" height="411" width="640"></a> <br>  Install the battery, rejoicing steep inscriptions 2.0 Megapixel.  You scrolled up by checking the inscription above the screen? <br> <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/A2JiPljMuRoeRssTsy51Hklg2eXU6E1J-xlQiJeAViQ%3Ffeat%3Dembedwebsite"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7a6/f49/8dc/7a6f498dc0495316255c553a12576611.jpg" height="480" width="640"></a> <br>  In the upper part of the case can be noted attachment for lace.  However, there is not only a lace, but also a narrow strap fits. <br> <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/icNA7nPtrJt4BoQT8aIi3klg2eXU6E1J-xlQiJeAViQ%3Ffeat%3Dembedwebsite"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/fb5/11d/3bd/fb511d3bdfc5ada52b176e8f2ad6a3d4.jpg" height="514" width="640"></a> <br>  Assembly takes place in the reverse order - gaskets, cover, screws. <br>  By the way, the same screwdriver (or nail) can remove the rubber plug of the connectors: <br> <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/UZctp50BrzodD7R9cniZfUlg2eXU6E1J-xlQiJeAViQ%3Ffeat%3Dembedwebsite"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f72/194/ba5/f72194ba520d65ef1de7f19ccf1c963a.jpg" height="480" width="640"></a> <br>  <b>Appearance: 8 points out of 10</b> <br>  For glamorous girls is not suitable for sure.  But in general - to some extent even a stylish, strong and securely assembled phone. <br><br><h4>  Insides <br></h4>  The phone is easy to understand.  To open access to the screws, it is necessary to remove (for example, a needle) 4 plugs on the edges of the case.  They have a different shape, and if you remember their location, it is likely that you will be able to insert them right the first time. <br> <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/t9R5D7iPdZpfqsJpR6hQRElg2eXU6E1J-xlQiJeAViQ%3Ffeat%3Dembedwebsite"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b05/5e9/0dd/b055e90dd25a04e6cf49c01b98bfa7df.jpg" height="479" width="640"></a> <br>  Then remove the cover, remove the battery and unscrew the 4 screws on the side of the battery, and 4 screws that were hidden behind the plugs. <br> <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/U39G9VLfUWKa-OpwqQ0IBUlg2eXU6E1J-xlQiJeAViQ%3Ffeat%3Dembedwebsite"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/959/15d/36b/95915d36b4eeb543b44ceb96834a4e62.jpg" height="481" width="640"></a> <br>  Remove the connector cover, and you can divide the phone into two halves: <br> <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/VltOfBN1T1p6byam12ou50lg2eXU6E1J-xlQiJeAViQ%3Ffeat%3Dembedwebsite"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/361/7f4/737/3617f4737509d8d2470774864a0e196a.jpg" height="480" width="640"></a> <br>  The body is made of thick plastic green (it is not a coating and will not be erased with time), with stiffeners in the right places. <br> <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/rgWnpBa5IUQlXFLUxU3aTUlg2eXU6E1J-xlQiJeAViQ%3Ffeat%3Dembedwebsite"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0d7/96e/f78/0d796ef789fb4d0ad9ee980b332fe9db.jpg" height="479" width="640"></a> <br>  At the top of the board is a camera module with a flash (which can be used as a flashlight ‚Äî it turns on by holding the center button), a large and loud speaker and a vibration motor. <br> <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/i7Gfwp5DeCijGdH6W_NpPElg2eXU6E1J-xlQiJeAViQ%3Ffeat%3Dembedwebsite"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b20/a15/ee6/b20a15ee642227386b159ebebe00f315.jpg" height="481" width="640"></a> <br>  Below are the slots for the SIM card and memory card, 5 test points (for debugging? Judging by the inscriptions, Uart was put there. I wonder if it accepts at-commands?), And the non-soldered slot of the second SIM card. <br> <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/c32PHtoKYckTiPwWKxvMPUlg2eXU6E1J-xlQiJeAViQ%3Ffeat%3Dembedwebsite"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7f2/065/54c/7f206554cf58187034b654f0b3eb1166.jpg" height="481" width="640"></a> <br>  On the back of the board is a microphone <br> <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/oX9pVYYS1QQMM2KvVu7UpUlg2eXU6E1J-xlQiJeAViQ%3Ffeat%3Dembedwebsite"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e36/756/b61/e36756b6111777a1b28196f7ff37678c.jpg" height="480" width="640"></a> <br>  And the screen.  Actually, what could have been said about the screen has already been said above.  176x220, TFT, in the sun you can see not so good, you had to cover with your hand. <br> <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/gv8Z_l0Il8aF4vfKCW1MVElg2eXU6E1J-xlQiJeAViQ%3Ffeat%3Dembedwebsite"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/682/669/fe9/682669fe9ee4d7dbf69c2513ee6790d7.jpg" height="640" width="479"></a> <br>  Razyomov, as I said - a little.  MicroUSB and Jack 2.5 for a headset. <br> <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/AQLmqfy-jhQNqnBlIsBchElg2eXU6E1J-xlQiJeAViQ%3Ffeat%3Dembedwebsite"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/286/564/698/2865646981e004b886fd4c921d6d7703.jpg" height="318" width="640"></a> <br>  On the back of the keyboard is protected by a silicone gasket.  The side buttons are not protected by anything, let's hope that their rather tight move is sufficient protection. <br> <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/iJCc37KgZPIkdqXsu9vAkklg2eXU6E1J-xlQiJeAViQ%3Ffeat%3Dembedwebsite"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ee8/9b9/ff3/ee89b9ff3b2f3067e0cc6a8923435db1.jpg" height="480" width="640"></a> <br>  The speaker at the top of the front panel also has no protection.  No, the glue with which it was glued will not allow water to penetrate inside the case.  But how will the dynamics please? <br> <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/dx72mG_wpVnNZ6NHZFUmyUlg2eXU6E1J-xlQiJeAViQ%3Ffeat%3Dembedwebsite"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/38c/532/78b/38c53278b93bd4fbceb069ab9a0b8f30.jpg" height="480" width="640"></a> <br>  But the rear speaker is already protected more thoroughly - by two grids, one of which is on the case, and the second one is on it. <br> <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/6d5I4G0BMfWFuqrUyJl0zElg2eXU6E1J-xlQiJeAViQ%3Ffeat%3Dembedwebsite"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/50c/ded/484/50cded484fc593a65aca609b4e61c027.jpg" height="481" width="640"></a> <br>  In the plastic body there are cuts - to compensate for the bend. <br> <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/iBoRPnZeOmgdQpjqpgIt30lg2eXU6E1J-xlQiJeAViQ%3Ffeat%3Dembedwebsite"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/255/1f3/b3d/2551f3b3d56c2a678b6cb3d3f2d5e90f.jpg" height="482" width="640"></a> <br>  <b>Insides on: 8 points out of 10</b> <br>  It looks reliable, but it is noticeable that the Chinese save on protection compared to the original.  On what only you will not go for the sake of the low price? <br><br><h4>  Test drive, regarding the declared characteristics. <br></h4>  So what was stated?  Carefully put the phone back, go back to the beginning and read in pedivikii: <br>  First digit 6 - <b>Dust cannot get into the device.</b>  <b>Full protection against contact</b> <br>  The second number 7 - <b>Short</b> - <b>term immersion to a depth of 1 m, with a short-term immersion water does not fall in quantities that disrupt the operation of the device.</b>  <b>Permanent work in immersed mode is not expected.</b> <br><br>  So, the test report: <br><br>  1) Falls and throws.  From a height of 0.5 meters, 1 meter, 2 meters, 5 meters (from the balcony), a game of football (kick 10 meters). <br>  All is well.  The maximum that was achieved was a pair of scratches on the side faces of the phone, but it continued to work, as if it had not happened.  The screen is located in the recess created by the overlays, so it was not scratched. <br> <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/ZopaFDWCw6KEgmuiFgtuC0lg2eXU6E1J-xlQiJeAViQ%3Ffeat%3Dembedwebsite"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b91/484/e09/b91484e09aa7b84a7cb246bac44a3a48.jpg" height="480" width="640"></a> <br><br>  2) Dust and sand.  Falling in the sand, sanding, burying in the sand, and as an apotheosis - the phone had to work in a sandbox with a scoop! <br>  Also passed.  The phone justified the first number - dry dirt, although it was stuffed in the natural folds of the case, could not cause any damage to the phone.  They knocked on the curb (see item 1), brushed it off - and you can use it. <br> <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/TCdQ1tzal_MM9UfAZ8hnuUlg2eXU6E1J-xlQiJeAViQ%3Ffeat%3Dembedwebsite"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e6b/cb5/5b4/e6bcb55b4c0d2023b7d4d0dad9395830.jpg" height="479" width="640"></a> <br><br>  3) Water.  Splashing, washing under running water, immersion in water. <br>  Spray - not a problem, washing under the tap - too.  A brief dive (at the level of ‚Äúdropped into a bucket of water, and immediately pulled out‚Äù) he also withstood without problems, but when he tried to hold it under water for more than 30 seconds, he showed bubbles (no, not on the screen) and turned off.  However, disassembly and drying saved the <s>father of the Russian democracy a</s> dialer, and he was again ready for battle. <br> <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/rRY6G_zzDtRVhF1XxAHfVUlg2eXU6E1J-xlQiJeAViQ%3Ffeat%3Dembedwebsite"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8bb/55d/e1f/8bb55de1fc6dff95cedfa56b5d1bee48.jpg" height="480" width="640"></a> <br><br>  4) Load.  We get up on the phone, jump on the phone, stamp the phone.  Fill the phone with a cement-plaster mix.  We move the phone by car. <br>  We get up on the phone - zero reaction.  The lock of the buttons saves from unexpected calls the sole of the boot, and more than that it does not react to the weight of the person.  Yes, and jumping also nel reaction.  That's when it began to happen in the sandbox - yes, plastic, protecting the screen had to be tight.  He could not stand the sharp edges of the sand and was a little scratched.  But all the functions are normal, after the sand has been shaken out of all the holes - it again pleases us with the melody of the bell. <br> <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/Cxpy_k5jT2AuWBC6H9kUb0lg2eXU6E1J-xlQiJeAViQ%3Ffeat%3Dembedwebsite"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/27a/d4d/945/27ad4d945a820e06ea4cb53e87bffa0c.jpg" height="480" width="640"></a> <br>  We find in the garage a bag of mixture left over from repair, we thin it and fill the ‚Äúbrick‚Äù with the phone inside.  After the plaster grabbed, try to call.  Brick vibrates a little and barely audible sings.  For the final purity of the experiment, we dry it in the oven at 150 degrees a day.  We repeat the test with the call - passed.  We find a perforator in the cabinet and in 30 seconds we release the phone from plaster captivity.  Half an hour pick out the remnants of gypsum from all the cracks. <br>  We call a friend with a car.  No, the scooter does not fit.  1600kg SUV - what we need!  We hit the wheel once - alive.  Hmm, said the harsh Siberian lumberjacks.  To be sure, we pass a couple of times.  Turns on, but shows a white screen.  Cracked matrix. <br>  RIP, you delivered us a lot of interesting minutes. <br> <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/44UvHYbGJsMsvKmNjniK4Elg2eXU6E1J-xlQiJeAViQ%3Ffeat%3Dembedwebsite"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8de/535/8a6/8de5358a6b16ce20a148cad9c7dc96f3.jpg" height="481" width="640"></a> <br><br>  <b>Protection on: 8 points out of 10</b> <br>  On the one hand, the declared protection against the ingress of water is not formally complied with - it would clearly not have passed certification.  On the other hand, he showed himself very worthily, having passed all tests, except the last. <br>  And, as promised, the crash test video: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/E5NF8JTgzYY%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700255,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhguGv1_IHsil8yfrKb7CoaMp5Je7g" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h4>  Working hours: <br></h4>  Unfortunately, with the time of work came a small overlay.  I could not measure the time of work from one charge, because in the three weeks that I played with him, I could not put the battery in full.  Honestly, I do not know if the plug works for charging - I have never charged it. <br>  <b>Work time on: 10 points out of 10</b> <br><br><h4>  Summary: <br></h4>  This is not a very high-quality copy of the original phone, the advantages of which are low price and relative (compared to other phones from the same price category) security.  Well, a big battery of course.  Interesting gift "hunter, fisherman" (s) or a child who breaks the third phone. <br><br><h4>  Related Links: <br></h4>  <a href="http://forum.china-iphone.ru/viewtopic.php%3Ff%3D18%26t%3D10303">Topic on china-iphone.ru</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.mobile-review.com/review/sonim-xp3.shtml">Original review</a> and <a href="http://www.nomobile.ru/reviews/78101.html">crash test</a> <br>  <a href="">Original prices</a> <br>  YouTube, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DLlvv3FMvwMQ">another video review</a> <br>  <a href="http://forum.fonarevka.ru/showthread.php%3Ft%3D5611">Topic on fonarevka.ru</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.gsmforum.ru/threads/127646-%25D0%259F%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5-%25D1%2580%25D1%2583%25D1%2581%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D1%2584%25D0%25B8%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D1%258C-sonim-s8">On gsmforum.ru try to make Russification.</a> <br><br>  <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/118217604724203015211/SonimS3%3Fauthuser%3D0%26authkey%3DGv1sRgCLjKoKK9gJm0twE%26feat%3Ddirectlink">These and other photos can be viewed in the album</a> <br>  And you can subscribe in order not to miss new reviews <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/boxowerview/">on the company‚Äôs page</a> and <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/vvzvlad/">in my profile</a> (‚Äúsubscribe‚Äù button) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/144737/">https://habr.com/ru/post/144737/</a></p>
