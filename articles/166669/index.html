At the end of December, YouMagic softphone came out on Linux, and on January 14, a release was launched on the Windows platform. <br><a name="habracut"></a><blockquote><img src="http://habrastorage.org/storage2/5f0/503/500/5f0503500369d89b08de852ce288e3b7.jpg" align="left"><br><br>  YouMagic for Linux was included in the operating system ROSA Desktop.Fresh 2012. This line of non-commercial operating systems for personal computers under the ROSA brand was developed by the Russian software company ROSA.  The choice of MTT of this operating system was due to its growing popularity, associated with a large number of advantages.  In the ‚Äúfresh‚Äù version of ROSA for PC, thanks in large part to the development of its own development environment and the use of international standards for checking the quality of the code, it was possible to achieve stable and uninterrupted system operation.  To increase the number of compatible operating systems with YouMagic, applications are being developed today for other versions of Linux.  This platform is actively used not only in large commercial structures, but also in government institutions.  On the portal CNews yesterday it was <a href="http://open.cnews.ru/top/2013/01/21/gigantskiy_rossiyskiy_linuxproekt_pochti_zavershen_516078">reported</a> that Linux versions had been transferred to almost all city polyclinics in Moscow.  Installation and configuration of the system is completed on 75% of the objects. <br></blockquote><br><br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/611/aad/cd8/611aadcd8bb69c53cb497f87af61a8dc.jpg"></div><br clear="right"><br clear="right">  While various versions of Linux operating systems are only gaining popularity, and according to various sources, they occupy from 1 to 29 percent of all platforms for PCs and laptops, then Microsoft's Windows system has long established itself among individuals and legal entities.  The recently released Windows softphone successfully passed tests on three versions of this operating system: XP, 7 and 8. MTT applications for the two platforms are designed in a single design and have an identical set of functions.

    <blockquote><img src="http://habrastorage.org/storage2/1c0/146/597/1c01465976cf07cf05821d65e24eae9a.jpg" align="left"><br>  One of the most notable innovations in YouMagic softphones on Windows and Linux was the free OPUS audio codec.  This codec creates a good quality of communication when talking on wireless Internet networks without access to public telephone networks.  OPUS was developed in 2012 and already in September of the same year it was recognized as the standard of the International Engineering Council of the Internet (IETF).  The excellent sound of the voice when using the new codec is achieved due to a well-balanced balance between the degree of audio signal compression and its quality.  All YouMagic softphones still support many other codecs that are used when calling to telephone networks. </blockquote><br><br><br>  In addition to the new OPUS, YouMagic for Windows and Linux has features that allow you to start working with the program immediately after its installation: ‚ÄúRegistration‚Äù and ‚ÄúDeposit funds‚Äù.  To pass a quick registration in the fields to fill in the data you need to enter your mobile number to receive the activation code, as well as the email address and password with its usual repetition.  Immediately after activation, the user is automatically assigned an international number and he can start working with the application.  Registration directly through the application greatly simplifies familiarity with IP-telephony from YouMagic, since now there is no need to go to the project site.  To speed up the replenishment of the account for calls to any phone numbers outside the network YouMagic help button "Deposit Account", which will redirect the user to the login page of your personal account on the service website.  You can pay your invoice to YouMagic using all traditional methods: popular electronics networks, bank cards (including foreign banks), payment systems, electronic money and SMS.  An important functional addition for desktop softphones is the display of the balance of the personal account and the cost of a minute of a future call. <br><br>  With the recently released releases, instant messaging (IM) between YouMagiis users has become available on three operating systems: Windows, Linux and Android.  In MTT they checked IM on all three versions, the developers provided Linux ROSA, the rest of the operating systems were not hard to find.  Used for all platforms of the YouMagic service, a single core written in C language made it possible to organize the exchange of fast messages between the three operating systems listed. <br><br>  <b>About other functional features</b> <br><br><blockquote><img src="http://habrastorage.org/storage2/5bf/162/8d9/5bf1628d9a3308d6f5238a284e93a816.jpg" align="left"><br><br>  YouMagic for two desktop operating systems has a wide range of settings.  So, the owner can quickly and conveniently adjust the sound quality, the list of contacts, turn on or off the recording of a conversation and send a log with an error report.  The sound quality in YouMagic is tuned by echo cancellation and calibration.  Software settings include a list of codecs that, if necessary, can be disabled and built in the order specified by the user.  In telephone networks, it is comfortable to communicate with a high-speed Internet connection using the g722 codec, and for the 3G channel, Silk or iLBC are used predominantly. <br></blockquote><br><br><br>  Recall that if you have not yet been identified in the YouMagic system by mobile number, then when registering your own international number, you will receive 10 rubles to your account.  This amount may be enough for 14 minutes of communication with Moscow and St. Petersburg.  The cost of a minute of conversation with any other city in Russia is 0.99 rubles, and conversations within the YouMagic network are free.  In addition to international telephone numbering, YouMagic also offers free city one.  Today, IPT service from MTT from the growing list of cities and countries offers numbers of Moscow, St. Petersburg, Kazan, Samara and others. <br><br>  <i>UPD: The</i> full list of provided numbering and information about tariffs are on the official website of the service in the section <a href="http://www.youmagic.com/ru/tarify-gorodov">"Tariffs"</a> . <br>  Download YouMagic <a href="http://www.rosalab.ru/products/desktop_fresh/download">for Linux (ROSA)</a> from the official website of the developer of the operating system. <br>  Download YouMagic <a href="http://www.youmagic.com/ru/download/windows">for Windows</a> from the official site of the service. <br><br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/166669/">https://habr.com/ru/post/166669/</a></p>
