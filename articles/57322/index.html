I do not like Twitter, although I sometimes write all kinds of dubbers there and sometimes post links (however, the links, for the most part, moved <a href="http://internetessa.com/2009/04/09/informacionnyj-dajdzhest-8-aprelya-pretenzii-k-google-socialnye-seti-v-politike-onlajnovye-ocenochnye-servisy/">to the blog</a> ). <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  So: <br><br>  <b>* Twitter is brevity - not the sister of talent, but the enemy of understanding.</b>

      Several times I came across a situation where I categorically did not understand the phrases I was told on Twitter.  140 characters are good, but it‚Äôs impossible to express the thought in them.  I had an example when I received a comment on my regular stream of links - a note in response from one user.  I did not understand which link the author responded to, and, most importantly, what he wanted to say.  I asked to repeat - the same situation.  Alas, my dear, to speak out as it is written there, it is impossible.  Especially the journalist.  Who now especially values ‚Äã‚Äãher work and does not want to lose her syllable <br><br>  <b>* short links</b> <br><br>  <a href="http://ht.ua/blog/tkachuk/992.php">Vlad Tkachuk</a> has already written about short links.  I would prefer to know what they offer me to open, and not to see something like tinyurl.  Ideally, it would be nice if the full link was displayed either in the snippet (although I hate them), and even better - in the address bar.  In my opinion, short links are the first path to virus outbreaks. <br><br>  <b>* sticky SMO</b> <br><br>  I have never been an active Twitter user before.  That is, I did not follow everyone, but only those people who are interesting to me as individuals (as an option, with whom I am familiar), or those who write interesting things, and not ‚ÄúI had muesli for breakfast.  And you".  But it turned out that my account is wildly popular.  I began to follow a lot of people.  Who, why, why?  So, the method of SMO - promotion.  I look at the whole thing, and I am very happy.  That when I came to LJ, then nobody knew about the SMO.  And my friends from there are not those who promote themselves, but people who are interested either in me as a person or in my posts from there.  By the way, about the SMO: it is so interesting to observe the general freindovaniye of my locking account, as well as other empty accounts (created for different purposes).  That is, the type I do not write, but my friends.  Mystery of nature, aha. <br><br>  <b>* dybr</b> <br><br>  I have already written about ‚ÄúLyddyb‚Äù on Twitter.  Somehow it is not very interesting to read who got sick, and who else did something like that.  Especially me with my huge flows of other information that needs to be studied and digested. <br><br>  At the same time, I can not fail to note the positive nuances of Twitter.  For example, my request to advise brandy friends of Twitter responded more quickly than LJ-friends.  In addition, the efficiency of Twitter allows you to receive instant information, for example, about events in Moldova or something else. <br><br>  Should I add that I have no doubt that all my counterarguments can be refuted and give my arguments of the usefulness of such a thing as Twitter, and everything written here is my IMHO. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/57322/">https://habr.com/ru/post/57322/</a></p>
