      Agree that knowledge of foreign languages ‚Äã‚Äãis now a very profitable skill - when applying for a job it is at least an additional plus sign.  And just somehow you feel more comfortable when you understand what the surrounding natives are talking about - be it Red Square or a foreign Internet site. <br><br>  But knowledge of languages ‚Äã‚Äãis not given to everyone, but if it is given to anyone, then to everyone in varying degrees.  That's just to correct this injustice, and this program was created.  No, do not worry - to make cram " <i>Landan from the land of Great Britain,</i> " it will not.  She just gently helps to feel more confident when meeting with an unfamiliar language. <br><img src="http://img691.imageshack.us/img691/4237/86286501.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The principle of its work is simple - after installation it climbs into the tray and sits quietly there.  But it is necessary to bring the mouse cursor to the unknown overseas word of the application or site, as soon as its translation appears!  And not just a translation (or several versions of it), but also a transcription with the possibility of sound reproduction by native speakers. <br><br>  The button at which the prompt with the translation will appear is set in the settings - you can make the tooltip appear when you hover, when you press a key or when a word is selected.  My choice is translation while holding the left Ctrl (allows you to translate text in applications + does not interfere when typing with Shift).  Additional settings are also enough. <br><br><img src="http://img132.imageshack.us/img132/6238/56301861.png" alt="image"><br><br>  It's nice that the program also has a built-in translator from Google - open the window, paste the necessary text there and in a moment we get the translation.  This is much faster than visiting the site of the translator.  Naturally, in this case, you need to connect to the Internet, otherwise the program works without a network - it has a huge built-in dictionary.  If it is not enough, 80 additional dictionaries can be downloaded from the manufacturer‚Äôs website for free, which are not included in the basic kit. <br><br><img src="http://img137.imageshack.us/img137/7655/13349547.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Another bonus is the usual dictionary.  Enter the word (or part of it) and immediately see the translation, synonyms and everything.  Well, in case there is no word, you can request it in online dictionaries or add it manually. <br><br><img src="http://img32.imageshack.us/img32/1818/92883299.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Translation can be obtained on websites, in applications, in PDF-files - I don‚Äôt even remember where the program would fail.  Although there is no, I will remember - in programs with non-standard controls it does not work forever, for example, only ‚Äútranslation by selection‚Äù works in Google Chrome.  Currently, work has been implemented between 4 languages, including English, German, Spanish and Russian. <br><br>  The program has two versions - free (Lite) and paid (Pro, 800 rubles for a lifetime license), here are their <a href="http://www.translateit.ru/tabl.htm">differences</a> .  Naturally, the paid version is more functional and the fact that the developers want a small money for it can be fully understood - the softphone is really pleasant and useful! <br><br>  In addition to the program for Windows and MacOS, there is a version for the PDA.  I think it‚Äôs not worth telling in more detail - try to do it yourself quickly.  Well, or watch my video: <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/-BH8kE5-TYs%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700043,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhhytz_RSJDEIo_FOWRRR8uwPNKxug" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <b>Changes in version 8:</b> <br><br>  - Added full support for Windows Vista and Windows 7; <br>  - Added support for Opera 10; <br>  - Implemented a new method of working with dictionaries, which allows to reduce the size of the memory used by the program, speed up the process of searching for a translation and ensure high speed of entry and exit from the passive mode; <br>  - Added grammar reference books of English and German; <br>  - Added the ability to download and install sound files directly from the program; <br>  - Increased overall stability of the program; <br>  - Updated: English-Russian dictionary, Russian-English dictionary, German-Russian dictionary; <br>  - The dictionary window has been reworked (now the search is performed in the direction of translation, and not by <br>  profile;  added search transfer function in Wiktionary;  dictionary window size now <br>  can be changed;  added the ability to show words similar to the spelling on the entered); <br>  - In the "Text Translation" window, the function of auto-detection of the translation language has been added, the ability to <br>  translation of "from" and "to" Hebrew. <br>  - Made more flexible settings for the transfer of words in the program LearnWords; <br>  - Downloading a large number of additional dictionaries no longer leads to <br>  slow down the operating system; <br>  - Calculation of the height of the translation window is now performed correctly regardless of the specified <br>  window width and font size; <br>  - Fixed errors that prevent the correct use of the morphology of the Russian language; <br>  - Fixed conflicts with other programs when installing the "hot key"; <br>  - Fixed errors when deleting and adding profiles; <br>  - Fixed minor bugs. <br><br><img src="http://img42.imageshack.us/img42/2527/56865364.png" alt="image"><br><br>  But it would be strange if I made a simple announcement :) In gratitude for the work, after the release of the final version, the beta testers were handed out on the personal key for the Pro-version.  And since  I already have it (I didn‚Äôt regret a pair of rubles in my time), then I have no choice but to share it with you. <br><br>  All you have to do is <a href="http://www.translateit.ru/">download the</a> distribution ( <a href="http://bit.ly/7UXhYY">VirusTotal</a> report), and after installing the softphone, enter a small spell when you first launch it (it only works in the latest version of the program!): <br><br>  <b>Name</b> : Habrahabr.ru <br>  <b>Key</b> : B3CX3-XQU7C-VUUE2-WGDGG-B3HVB-E7NNA-CH59Q-7F94X-L2AV5 <br><br>  Everything, now with a clear conscience, you can use) This program helps me when reading and correspondence of the year since 2006 - I hope you will like it too.  If you find any errors or there are suggestions for improvement - leave in the comments. <br><br>  Other similar bonuses will multiply on my <a href="http://twitter.com/Boomburum">twitter</a> . <br>  <b>Successes!</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/76774/">https://habr.com/ru/post/76774/</a></p>
