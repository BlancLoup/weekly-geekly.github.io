  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The very first manager opening</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Many articles are written on how the mind of a specialist breaks down when he becomes a manager.  He has to do other tasks, another level of responsibility falls on his head, completely different areas of the brain are involved. <br><br>  In this short article we will discuss one discovery, which I made shortly after I began to lead the team.  And also about how I came to this discovery. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  The evolution of a specialist in a manager </h4><br>  First you need to understand how the consciousness of the specialist who chose the path of management is changing.  He began to move along this path as a result of some of the events that occurred with or without his participation.  Somewhere he took the initiative, he turned up somewhere in time, somewhere he made the right decision.  Each time he got closer to the goal, saw it more clearly.  Rarely for whom the appointment of the manager becomes a surprise.  The person usually understands what led to this.  No revolutions, continuous evolution. <br><br>  Therefore, I believe that there are no sharp needs to change your mind when you move from a specialist to a manager.  Everything happens gradually.  And when some gradual changes occur in our head, that is, stretched in time, we also gradually forget our original state.  In this case, this is the state when we have not yet thought about management and were ordinary developers / testers.

    <h4>  Bitter truth </h4><br>  What is the result?  When we become managers, we already think differently from most of our colleagues.  Today we come to work to lead those who we ourselves were yesterday.  We rely on dedication, responsibility, dedication and independence of our subordinates.  That is, we are waiting for everything that we ourselves have awarded our manager with. <br><br>  And then the truth pops up.  Yesterday, as an ordinary member of the team, you really were no longer one of them.  You were a formed manager (albeit a junior manager).  You just had to hatch out of the egg and take your place in the world.  And you have long forgotten how people who come to work ‚Äúpedal‚Äù and get paid for it, or those who are more interested in the technical side of the issue, think. <br><br>  Bitter this truth does this: it turns out, your subordinates do not care much.  On what will happen to the project.  to the fact that the deadlines are running, to the fact that if someone now goes on vacation.  then we will not be able to unleash, to the fact that if we do not stay at work today, the client will think that we are irresponsible and will not give us a new part of our business.  In general, everything that goes beyond their area of ‚Äã‚Äãinterest. <br><br>  You are no longer like this (at least in professional terms).  And it will hurt you when you understand this.  But this pain has a plus.  Now you know exactly what you, as a manager, will have to do most of the time. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/293614/">https://habr.com/ru/post/293614/</a></p>
