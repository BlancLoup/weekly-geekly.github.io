Two weeks ago, I just yelled, today I will nagging arguments.  So, a little more than two weeks have passed since Habr's separation.  In my opinion, it is already possible to sum up.  And they are something so selfish. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a98/1b1/24e/a981b124e32d4c0e8a816981f02e0787.jpg"><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>First: few people read Geektime</b> <br>  More precisely not so when I look at article on Geektimes and I see their attendance, I want "to cry from a grief, or to be forgotten in melancholy".  Knowing the average attendance at Habr√© before the division and now, I see that similar articles see 5 times less people.  Here is a simple comparison:

      Topic about new <a href="http://geektimes.ru/post/240320/">Nexus 6</a> on Geektimes: +33, 20 thousand visits. <br>  Topic about <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/200410/">Nexus 5</a> on Habr√©: +103, 172 thousand. <br><br>  Ok, in the case of the Nexus 6 it was only about the phone, in the topic about the Nexus 5 they also spoke about the new Android.  Well, the text about <a href="http://geektimes.ru/post/240306/">Android 5</a> on Geektimes: 66+, 26 thousand.  While most likely these visits intersect with each other. <br><br>  Next, the text about the new <a href="http://geektimes.ru/post/240358/">iPad, Macs, etc.</a>  Geektimes: +45, 20,5 thousand visits.  Last year <a href="http://geektimes.ru/post/198616/">on Habr√©</a> : +78, 139 thousand visits. <br>  And I chose the most noticeable texts and topics, usually collecting a lot of views. <br><br>  <b>Second: there‚Äôs nothing to read</b> <br>  The first few days after the separation of Habr, a complete mess was happening at Geektimes.  At first some graphomania flooded (the author immediately sawed it out).  Then adequate to this Mosigra arranged a <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/mosigra/blog/240178/">census of</a> "good books."  Including "The Masters and Margarita" and others, absolutely geek books.  By the way, it was the first and last post of Mosigra, after which they returned to Habr.  Then posts <a href="http://geektimes.ru/post/240168/">from Captain Obvious</a> and other mythical characters began to appear.  Well, something periodically slips so far. <br><br>  What am I talking about?  On Habr√© such posts fiercely zaminusovali.  Accordingly, those who come to read, see this bedlam, and go back to the usual Habr.  Alas, but rules of publications on Geektimes are still not defined.  And so far it is a sort of chat from time to time, with the appropriate semantic content. <br><br>  <b>Third: there are no normal comments there.</b> <br>  It's simple, Habr is first of all a community.  And, as has been emphasized many times, comments on the article are often more important and interesting than the topic.  I myself often write for comments.  However, where will they come from if attendance is 5 times less?  Those.  instead of 50 comments there will be 10. Instead of 100 - only 20. So it turns out that there is nothing to read again. <br><br>  <b>Fourth: there is no clear boundary between Habrom and Giktatimes</b> <br>  I understand the logic, why part of the Hubs drank from Habr, but why they drank so much and why you can not write to the rest, I do not understand.  So an example.  I am writing a text on Habr about Google volunteers and their option of voluntary technical support.  The Google Hub, as it turned out, was cut (why?). <br>  Ok, I put it in ‚Äúsystem administration‚Äù because it is about tech support, ‚Äúcommunity management‚Äù, because how to build a loyal community.  Well, bothering to "project management."  A few minutes later my text is cut out by the moderators and placed in ‚ÄúI am promoting‚Äù.  Although, as you can see further, this is not true at all.  The text starts to collect the minuses because of misunderstanding (I would also minus, because in such a Hub it‚Äôs a nonsense to write about it).  Ok, delete the post and go to the "alternate aerodrome", i.e.  I publish on geektimes.  The post collects pluses and goes to the 6th place in the ‚Äúbest for the day‚Äù rating.  Post <a href="http://geektimes.ru/post/240752/">here it is</a> . <br><br>  As already mentioned, I do not understand why he should be on Geektimes, and why on Habr√© his place is only in ‚ÄúI am promoting‚Äù.  Another example: a post <a href="http://geektimes.ru/post/240618/">about Inbox</a> .  As far as I understand, due to the absence of the Google Hub, it hangs on geektimes.  As for me, it is the place for him on Habr√©. <br><br>  <b>Conclusions</b> : no conclusions.  I still do not like Geektimes.  And, alas, I do not see anything on the site changing for the better.  Now it is no better than many other sites on similar topics. <br><br>  And the last, actually, for the sake of what I wrote this topic.  Voting.  But it seems to me that I am the only one here who is bored </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/241850/">https://habr.com/ru/post/241850/</a></p>
