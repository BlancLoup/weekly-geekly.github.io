    <h3>  Briefly the essence.  Chicago, May 1, 1886 </h3><br>  The working day systematically lasts about 15 hours, wages are low, there are no social guarantees. <br><br>  Today, a worker, having become accustomed to modern working conditions as a given, can imagine himself in the place of 19th century workers.  Such is the thought experiment - assess the scale of the problem, approaching the personal, and if you have a family, family tragedy, a person who, having freedom, does not have free time and material resources. <br><br>  Of course, rallies and strikes began.  I would not like to copy the text of an already well-written article, so I suggest those interested to follow the link " <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2591%25D1%2583%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582_%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0_%25D0%25A5%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B9%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582">Riot to the Haymarket</a> ."  There is enough: a rally, police, a provocateur, a bomb, shooting, slander and the death penalty of innocent people. <br><br><blockquote>  The American press attacked all leftists indiscriminately.  The judges and the jury were opposed to the accused, the bomb thrower did not even try to establish, the petitions for the trial of each defendant were rejected separately.  <b>The line of accusation was based on the fact that once the defendants did not take measures to search for a terrorist in their ranks, it means that they were in collusion with him.</b> <br><br>  ... <br><br>  Of the defendants, only Fielden and Parsons were ethnic Englishmen, the rest were natives of Germany, of whom only Neebe was born in the United States, while others were immigrants.  This circumstance, as well as the fact that the rally itself and the anarchist publications were addressed to German-speaking workers led to the fact that the American public mostly ignored what happened and favorably responded to the following executions, <b>if somewhere there was a revival of the labor movement in support of the defendants, then abroad - in Europe.</b> </blockquote>  In memory of this event, the first Paris Congress of the Second International in July 1889 decided to hold annual demonstrations on May 1.  This day was declared an international holiday for all workers. <br><br>  Sometimes there are opinions that in Russia this holiday was borrowed in the revolutionary period, they say, they can not invent anything from us.  I note that, firstly, the Day of International Solidarity of Working People cannot be borrowed, it can only be joined, and secondly, May Day was celebrated for the first time In the Russian Empire in 1890 in Warsaw, a strike of 10 thousand workers was held. <br><br>  According to some media reports, for most citizens of Russia this day is just a reason for entertainment, an additional day off and the beginning of the garden season.  I think that the reason is mainly in the lack of enlightenment in the history of the issue.  Social order, the world has become better, the struggle against oppression was given in countries around the world at different prices.  Definitely, there is something to be grateful for, to appreciate and cherish. <br><br><h3>  Item - Money - Item </h3><br>  "Sell yourself."  Have you heard anything like this at the interview?  Most likely you are lucky, the IT people in this issue are more adequate, but if we are talking about the vacancy of a sales manager or a marketer, this happens.  Yes, of course, you should understand the phrase in the context: you came for an interview - you sell yourself as an employee, you sell your own labor on the labor market. <br><br>  However, after the start of the self-presentation, immediately and quickly the potential employer stops.  No, it's not about self-presentation.  A person looks at the reaction of another person.  What for?  Take the phrase ‚Äúsell yourself‚Äù out of context and draw a conclusion about the compromise behavior of a person in relation to his honesty, morality? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xf/lw/zz/xflwzzazvxp4-sdb6-uqpk6icmy.jpeg"><br><br><h3>  Does the paradigm shift? </h3><br>  What does ‚Äúemployee sell himself‚Äù mean?  Yes, the employee changes his labor for money.  But <b>exchange is a two-way business.</b> <br><br>  Does an employee buy an employer in due time?  "Employer sell yourself?" <br><br>  Money is not a universal equivalent.  Money is the all-material equivalent.  This is an intermediate stage of exchange. <br><br><ul><li>  The employee does not sell himself, but exchanges time and effort for money. </li><li>  The employer exchanges money for the effort and time of the employee. </li></ul><br>  They are equal in the exchange process.  <b>The word sell is a kind of word exchange, in which money is involved.</b>  <b>The word, invented to denote a particular case, may be completely abolished.</b>  But it captured the consciousness and design of a contemporary thinking.  Money did not appear immediately, but a very long time.  Here are the monetary exchange formulas, well-known far beyond the economic universities: <br><br><blockquote>  Product / Services &lt;-&gt; Product / Services = Exchange <br><br>  Goods / services -&gt; money -&gt; Goods / services = Sale (Exchange through money) <br><br>  Product / services -&gt; money <b>managed by an ethical person</b> -&gt; Product / services = Selling '(Exchange with respect) </blockquote>  And do not move us to the paradigm of corruption, acceptable to the morally weak (it is not all that) capital, in the direction of the exchange with respect to the person and man.  No, this is absolutely not a call to refuse money.  Do not misunderstand me.  I want employees to not sell in the future, but exchange their labor with respect. <br><br>  If you ever take to ‚Äúchew on this meaningful bun‚Äù to someone, keep the word ‚Äúexchange‚Äù in your head.  The concepts of buy / sell are so deep in the mind of a person that you yourself can get confused before the interlocutor understands this. <br><br><h3>  Interesting fact </h3><br>  In business correspondence, the signature ‚ÄúRegards, Name‚Äù has been widely distributed.  Yes, perhaps, the forgotten truths leave imprints in the form of traditions or customs of conducting ‚Äúbusiness negotiations‚Äù.  May 1 is an excellent reason to think about their meaning. <br><br>  <i>With respect to you and your business, I congratulate Habr, readers and authors on May 1.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/450216/">https://habr.com/ru/post/450216/</a></p>
