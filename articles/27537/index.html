  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Game platform Mail.Ru</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The Internet portal Mail.Ru has launched its own gaming platform, thus announcing that it has entered the casual online games market.  As part of the <a href="http://games.mail.ru/mini">game</a> .@Mail.ru, a beta version of the <a href="http://games.mail.ru/mini">multiplayer mini-games</a> section was opened on June 17. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/aad/ee1/eec/aadee1eecd2298344ab0e78280b66b2c.jpg" width="450" height="158" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br>  The new service ‚ÄúMini-Games‚Äù is closely integrated with other Mail.Ru projects, such as blogs, photo albums and Worlds in the <a href="http://my.mail.ru/">My World</a> social network.  Such integration allows you to find opponents from among the registered users of the portal, provides the opportunity to communicate in the in-game chat and add an opponent to the Mail.Ru Agent contact list in one click. <br><br>  All games (and the entire section as a whole) were made in flash, which made them colorful and spectacular.  And, I must say, made just for sight.  To date, 8 games are represented in the ‚ÄúMini-games‚Äù, in each of which, depending on the conditions, from 2 to 6 people can participate.  The figure 8, however, is somewhat incorrect, since  in fact games 6. Just billiards and a fool are presented in two forms. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Billiards <br>  Billiards, as already mentioned, in the "Mini-games" two.  "Eight" and "nine."  In appearance they, of course, are identical.  The only difference is in the rules that can be read by clicking on the ‚Äú?‚Äù Symbol in the upper right corner of the screen.  Table, flying balls, adjusting the direction and force of impact - all right.  You can either practice, or immediately fight with an opponent.  With rivals (i.e., with their absence), by the way, no problems are foreseen.  So climb to offer a party. <br><br>  Fool <br>  If billiards is not satisfied with something, you can play the card "fool".  In the flip or transfer, as you like.  Unlike billiards, there is no ‚Äútraining‚Äù (you won‚Äôt be playing with yourself, and the computer opponent is not provided).  With the rules, I think, no one will have any problems.  Management is amazingly comfortable, no complaints.  But one thing (which, however, is true for all games, and not just for the Fool) - the musical accompaniment leaves much to be desired.  Well at least you can turn it off.

      Mahjong Dragon <br>  As in the case of a pool and a fool, there is nothing special to tell about the game itself.  Mahjong is like Mahjong.  Is that a bit simplified, compared, for example, with games from <a href="http://cynagames.com/">Kiodai</a> .  You can collect bones alone or in a team.  For the introduction of at least some diversity in the gameplay in Mahjong Dragon, various bonuses are available.  ‚ÄúGood bonuses‚Äù (hint, for example), ‚ÄúUnkind bonuses‚Äù (such as ‚Äú5 seconds of inactivity‚Äù or ‚Äú-10 bones to the enemy‚Äù) and ‚ÄúSuper bonuses‚Äù (hint for the whole game, etc.). <br><br>  Snowballs <br>  Arcade with elements of action!  Ho ho  Honestly, I would prefer snowballs, in which you need to peel fun with shells of oncoming opponents.  But in the local snowballs everything is different.  Here you need to destroy the fortress.  It consists of balls of different colors.  The user also throws balls of different colors.  If you put three balls together, they disappear.  Standard.  And generally not interesting. <br><br>  Lab  Monsters <br>  The labs too, like Snowballs, is a mouthwash for me personally, but probably popular with secretaries and other office plankton games like ‚Äúclear the field, collecting three or more pieces in a row‚Äù.  The competitive part is that all players should try to fill their ‚Äúflasks‚Äù with as many monsters as possible. <br><br>  Kosmozhestyanka <br>  This game is only called strange.  And in fact it is "Tetris".  It is quite standard, except that several people fill the glasses at the same time.  Moreover, depending on the drop-down bonuses, they either help themselves or shuffle the opponent with might and main by mixing the pieces in the glass.  An exciting game can not be called, but against the background of "Snowballs" and "Lab.monstrov" is quite personal. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/27537/">https://habr.com/ru/post/27537/</a></p>
