Refusing to watch TV in my own time, almost without encountering various print publications, I almost forgot how easy it is to put the most delusional thought into the minds of thousands of people simply by repeating it often enough.  And that thought, which will be discussed now, is called ‚Äúinnovation‚Äù. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  Wikipedia defines this term as follows: <br><br>  <i><b>Innovation</b> (English. Innovation) - is an innovation introduced, providing a qualitative increase in the efficiency of processes or products, demanded by the market.</i>  <i>Is the end result of human intellectual activity, his imagination, the creative process, discoveries, inventions and rationalization</i> <i><br></i>

      Appearing on the iPhone market is innovation.  It was a qualitative innovation, not a gradual increase in hardware capacity, not extensive development, but a <u>qualitative</u> transformation of a regular phone.  Poking into a resistive screen with a stylus, tormenting themselves with ‚Äúintuitive‚Äù handwriting input systems, trying to see something on the sluggish screens, users wanted a miracle and it happened.  This miracle was not created in the depths of Nokia, Samsung, Google, HTC, it was "the result of human intellectual activity, his imagination, creative process, discoveries, inventions and rationalization" within a company that had never produced telephones before.  Did the future competitors realize this?  Not right away.  Moreover, immediately after the appearance of the iPhone, it was called a ‚Äútoy‚Äù and was not taken seriously. <br><br>  The time has passed.  A new company, suddenly grabbed a piece of the market, and the fattest and most delicious.  And here the rest had to start moving.  Android completely <a href="http://mobile-review.com/articles/2012/android-history.shtml">rewritten</a> .  From a blackberry-like OS, it‚Äôs something like Apple.  The phone manufacturers copied the look and, most importantly, the user experience from iOS (touchwiz).  Was it an innovation?  Not.  The market went along the beaten Apple road, in a rarefied flow, without investing in research, in RnD, exploiting the successful concept found. <br><br><blockquote>  <font color="gray">A little distraction.</font>  <font color="gray">If you are fond of sports, you probably know about a few comedic practices in track cycling, or rather in such discipline as the sprint.</font>  <font color="gray">Riders ride three laps, but only the last 200 meters are clocked.</font>  <font color="gray">In this case, the result obtained does not determine the winner; he is the one who first crosses the finish line.</font>  <font color="gray">In this situation, it is most advantageous to start the finish sprint (last 200 meters) coming from behind the opponent's back.</font>  <font color="gray">Firstly, he doesn‚Äôt see you there, secondly it‚Äôs easier to follow him - less energy is spent on overcoming air resistance.</font>  <font color="gray">As a result, the first two laps racers tend to take the position of a catch-up.</font>  <font color="gray">It looks pretty ridiculous:</font> <font color="gray"><br><br></font> <iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/oI3qWekkYtI%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700022,15700043,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhha9-9V761HfEnhCNzT6Id1Qj-nGQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> <font color="gray"><br><br></font>  <font color="gray">Catch an analogy?</font>  <font color="gray">The first two circles are RnD.</font>  <font color="gray">Samsung I sit behind me, puts a minimum of effort to then get out of the back of a competitor and hit the jackpot.</font>  <font color="gray">Right?</font>  <font color="gray">Not really.</font>  <font color="gray">Is that the market?</font>  <font color="gray">Suppose, but then why not say ‚Äúthis is patent law‚Äù or ‚Äúthe law is harsh, but is it the law‚Äù and calm down?</font> <font color="gray"><br></font> </blockquote><br><br>  The time has passed.  Nothing changed.  More megahertz, more memory, more screen.  There is no qualitative leap, there is no transformation of the market.  Why does Samsung call itself an innovative company?  What is innovation? <br><br><hr><br><br>  I hate to read that copying boosts competition.  Apple doesn‚Äôt have to spur, the iPod lineup is actually lonely on the market, it doesn‚Äôt compete with anyone, and yet we have seen dramatic changes in the iPod shuffle and iPod nano in the past few years.  The tablet market actually did not exist before the iPad, no one took it seriously.  Copying, in fact, is a pack of wolves that pounds the game.  When the game is eaten - the wolves will go to bed, a period of stagnation will come on the market.  No innovation, as usual. <br><br>  And when there is no innovation, it remains only to manipulate the mind.  Murtazin erases his fingers with blood, riveting reviews separately for playing music in the Galaxy III, separately for accessories for him, a battery from him, two reviews of the carcass as a whole, a camera review, a comparison with competitors (in which the Galaxy always wins), etc.  etc.  Even at Habr√© there are reviews of Samsung technology in the spirit of ‚ÄúI accidentally got into the hands of the device before the start of sales and now I go with it for a week ... this innovative device." <br><br>  I do not want to agitate anyone for one of the parties to the conflict, I urge you to think with your head.  On this and finish, perhaps. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/150309/">https://habr.com/ru/post/150309/</a></p>
