  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Uninterruptible power supplies for DC</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Interruptions in data center operations seriously damage their customers and harm the image of the companies themselves.  Therefore, it is important for owners to find effective solutions to improve the reliability of power supply of their DC.  Global manufacturers of uninterruptible power supply for data centers, such as Eaton, Virtual Power Systems and EnerSys have proposed options for the implementation of UPS. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/80e/624/a4c/80e624a4cd04471b97a15da75516e7c0.jpg"><br><br><h4>  UPS Power Xpert 9395 by Eaton </h4><br>  Eaton has presented a new high-performance uninterruptible power system for small and medium data centers - Power Xpert 9395. This is a highly efficient solution that provides modifications of 200-600 kilowatts (kW) with a rated voltage of 400V and a frequency of 50/60 Hz.  The system supports the Eaton Energy Saver System Saver technology, with which at maximum load it will be possible to bring the efficiency up to 99% (at a load below 15% - not less than 95%).

The fact is that the new modular design allows maximum use of the space inside the DC, eliminating the need to expand the building.  Also, the system should reduce the cost of ownership of the computing infrastructure, increasing its scalability and reliability.  In addition, the new UPS generates 33% less heat, which will save on power supply of air conditioners and chillers. <br><br>  Power Xpert 9395 has increased fault tolerance.  It has the patented HotSync load balancing technology that enables parallel operation of power modules without additional control cables. <br><br>  A feature of the new UPS is the support of the proprietary technology PredictPulse, which represents a 24/7 remote monitoring service.  Every 15 minutes, he collects and analyzes UPS data, thereby helping Eaton engineers to warn users of potential problems in case of anything. <br><br><h4>  Lithium Ion UPS Systems from Virtual Power Systems </h4><br>  Virtual Power Systems relies on intelligent lithium-ion UPS systems with a rack-mount form factor.  Vice President of Business Development and Sales Ankush Dham (Ankush Dham) expressed his opinion on this matter.  He spoke at the Open Compute Project Summit 2016 conference held in San Jose (USA).  Dham believes that over time, the attitude of data center operators to the distribution of electricity within the data center may change.  And this will be affected by the proliferation of the spread of lithium-ion UPS systems.  Such devices are safer and safer than modern lead-acid analogues.  Lithium-ion systems can save valuable space inside the DC, reduce the load on the cooling system, have a higher power density and lower heat dissipation. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/DfBGnt_7umw%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhhkGx3m7BQ4LElDCXuuxIhHt-sx6w" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <i>OCP Summit: Building intelligent Li-ion batteries</i> <br><br>  The company introduced a pilot VPS platform, which consists of software and hardware.  The VPS ICE software console is complemented by a 2U lithium-ion UPS with three battery modules and hot-swappable.  The device with a capacity of 12 kW is able to provide emergency power up to 6 minutes. <br><br><h4>  EnerSys Batteries for UPS with High Power Density </h4><br>  The US company EnerSys has released a new line of batteries in the EnerSys DataSafe XE series for uninterruptible power supplies.  Compared with conventional lead-acid analogues, they provide an increased density of power and the duration of the autonomous operation period. <br><br>  In the words of UPS Marketing Manager at EnerSys, Dan Rocha (Dan Roche): <br><blockquote>  Modern batteries should reach a new level.  It is necessary that they be able to provide more power in a shorter time, and also to work longer at elevated ambient temperatures. </blockquote><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ad1/82b/82a/ad182b82ace542038ff1de33209dc42c.png"><br><br>  <i>DataSafe XE</i> <br><br>  DataSafe XE batteries have been developed using Thin Plate Pure Lead (TPPL) technology.  Thanks to this technology, devices can operate in an extended temperature range from -40 ¬∞ F (-40 ¬∞ C) to 122 ¬∞ F (50 ¬∞ C).  This makes them suitable for use inside data centers with a high density of components, as well as reduce cooling costs. <br><br>  DataSafe XE is designed using a special Absorbed Glass Mat (AGM) technology, in which more plates are placed in a two-volt cell.  Each plate is made of lead of higher purity - this reduces the generation of gas inside the cell and three times prolongs their shelf life compared with conventional batteries. <br><br>  According to the developers of EnerSys, the devices of the DataSafe XE line are the first commercially available TPPL-based batteries designed specifically to meet the needs of data centers.  Their creators managed to circumvent the problems characteristic of lead-acid batteries with calcium-doped plates.  Namely: avoid corrosion of the lead grid in acid over time and prevent the grid size from growing when batteries are exposed to high temperatures. <br><br><h4>  Forecasts from Global Market Insights and TechNavio </h4><br>  The company Global Market Insights has conducted research, according to which by 2022 the total turnover of the global UPS market will reach $ 6.65 billion. The highest turnover among regional markets will fall on North America.  And the world's leading companies in the market will be: Emerson, Ametek Inc., Eaton, ABB Ltd, Mitsubishi Electric, General Electric Co., Delta Electronics Inc., Siemens and Schneider Electric SA. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cfb/6b1/0c6/cfb6b10c6ac24f559957b77e2b39aed3.png"><br><br>  Experts of the consulting company TechNavio believe that in the period from 2016 to 2020.  The turnover of the global market for modular UPS for data centers will increase by an average of 11% every year.  They highlight the regional market of the Asia-Pacific region as the most promising.  According to TechNavio, it will account for about 39% of total revenue. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/283416/">https://habr.com/ru/post/283416/</a></p>
