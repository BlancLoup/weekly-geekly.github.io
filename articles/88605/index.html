We are getting closer to release! <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><hr>  <b>Disclaimer</b> <br>  The author does not claim the laurels of a professional translator, has the experience of the year in Lightroom 2.x.  But <b>constructive</b> criticism is still welcome. <hr><br>  As this public beta is closer to release, we are more focused on getting feedback than the original beta.  And more importantly, by using a wider range of testers (the wider community of photographers), we can ensure that you can trust the quality of the final release of Lightroom 3.0. <br>  As in the case of our first public beta, we went back to the drawing board and revisited what we consider to be the main priorities of our users: performance and image quality.  The first beta version of Lightroom 3 was ‚Äústripped‚Äù to the engine, in order to restore the performance of the architecture that would meet the needs of photographers with growing collections of images and an increase in the number of megapixels. <br><br>  The raw processing engine has also undergone a major overhaul, right down to the basic demozica algorithms, which now provide unprecedented results for sharpening and reducing noise.  The feedback was very positive, but there were certainly areas where we received ‚Äúharsh love‚Äù portions, and we took this feedback into account in this update. <br><br><h5>  Overview of the new in this version: </h5><br><ul><li>  Improved application performance for quick import and download of images. </li><li>  Native support for controlling the shooting of Nikon and Canon DSLR cameras. </li><li>  Luminance noise reduction support (added to the color noise reduction support available in the first public beta) to get outstanding ISO results. </li><li>  Support for importing and managing DSLR camera video files to enhance the photographer‚Äôs workflow. </li><li>  Improving importing experience in the first beta with feedback from the public. </li><li>  Improved watermark functionality (added in the first beta version), reflecting wishes received from users. </li></ul><br>  Please see additional information that is included. <br>  <a href="http://labs.macromedia.com/technologies/lightroom3/releasenotes.pdf">in notes to this update</a> .  These notes are an overview of the changes since the first beta version of Lightroom 3.

    <h4>  Import </h4><br>  The modified import was an important improvement in speeding up access to your photos and increasing the ability to efficiently organize your photos.  A <a href="http://forums.adobe.com/message/2359185">significant amount of feedback</a> was received in this area, and we worked a lot to take into account not only requests to improve the workflow, but also the performance of the operation.  More detail below: <br><ul><li>  The <i>view of the folders has</i> been greatly improved, for a clear view of the folder hierarchy and the ability to quickly collapse the hierarchy by double-clicking or ‚Äústicking‚Äù the folder.  The performance of this type has also been improved. </li><li>  The default selection has been enhanced so that the import waits for the folder selection before scanning it for images and remembers the last visited folder. </li><li>  Lightroom's import performance has been greatly improved when copying from an external map or simply adding a folder from its current location. </li><li>  The compact import type has become more powerful, providing access to important, commonly used fields that can be configured in the main import window, while the values ‚Äã‚Äãfrom the preset are taken as the basis for the selection. </li><li>  Lightroom will import frequently used video file formats.  (More on this below) </li><li>  The full size preview of the image located on the memory card can be viewed in the ‚ÄúMagnifier‚Äù display of the Import module. </li></ul><br><h4>  Video format support </h4><br>  Video files recorded by new DSLR cameras are becoming an important part of the photographer‚Äôs creative work and their support has been hotly debated. <br>  <a href="http://forums.adobe.com/thread/552661">in the subject of the forum</a> Lightroom 3 beta. <br>  This update allows photographers to confidently import all video content recorded on their Compact Flash or SD card and Lightroom will help them manage and organize video along with images. <br>  Tags, rating, filtering, collections and smart collections are available for organizing video content, and a video filter will help you instantly select video files in the collection. <br>  In the <i>grid</i> and <i>magnifier, the</i> duration of the video file is displayed on the preview of the video content, and the playback of the video file is just a click away. <br><br><h4>  Capture images from connected cameras </h4><br>  You do not need to be a professional photographer in the studio to evaluate the speed of work with connected cameras. <br>  Each time you need quick access to the image immediately after taking a picture, simply connect a Nikon or Canon DSLR camera via USB or Firewire and start working with the camera ‚Äî view key camera settings, control the shutter release, or use various metadata and develop settings to the captured images.  There is no need for middleware or ‚Äúmonitoring‚Äù of folders, Lightroom will communicate with the camera and confidently transfer images to the folder you specify.  For this first implementation, we have certified connection to a limited number of Nikon and Canon DSLR cameras and are looking forward to moving in this direction in the future. <br><br><h6>  Canon </h6><br>  EOS 1Ds Mark II * <br>  EOS 1D Mark III <br>  EOS 1Ds Mark III <br>  EOS 1D Mark IV <br>  EOS 5D * <br>  EOS 5D Mark II <br>  EOS 40D <br>  EOS 450D (Digital Rebel XSi / EOS Kiss X2) <br>  EOS 500D (Digital Rebel T1i / EOS Kiss X3 Digital) <br>  EOS 7D <br>  EOS 1000D (Digital Rebel XS / EOS Kiss F) <br><br><h6>  Nikon </h6><br>  D3 <br>  D3X <br>  D3s <br>  D300 <br>  D300s <br>  D5000 <br>  D700 <br>  D90 <br>  <sub>* Support for connecting these cameras is not available in 64-bit versions of Windows.</sub> <br><br><h4>  Public collections </h4><br>  The functionality of public collections has been improved as follows: <br><ul><li>  Advanced options for customizing the Flickr header field </li><li>  Added the ability to specify the required file size for the exported image </li><li>  Export supports original video files </li></ul><br><h4>  Image quality </h4><br><h5>  Increase clarity and reduce noise </h5><br>  The quality improvements in the first beta of Lightroom 3 were well received, but they were incomplete without the ability to control luminance noise.  Lightroom 3 Beta 2 is a much more complete solution that includes controlling luminance noise, and we are pleased to hear your thoughts on this improvement.  Open the metadata filter in the library module to select your high ISO images and let us know if the combination of brightness and color noise reduction provides you with the desired quality.  In general, the new processing technology should really reveal the best among your raw files.  Details and textures will be displayed more clearly and in part more naturally.  We have now applied the minimum noise suppression in the new demosaic method compared to the previous version (Lightroom 2.6).  This means that the surfaces are displayed more texturally and ‚Äúbiting‚Äù.  For example, a photograph of a fruit or leaves will display extremely textured details on the surface of the fruit and the streaks of the leaves.  It also means that images with very high ISO will be set to 0 by default because of the ‚Äúemerging‚Äù grain.  The grain looks much better, but to be sure, if you're just going to change it, put an absolute number telling you how much to change. <br><br><h5>  Vignette </h5><br>  Due to numerous requests, we returned to post-cropping vignette (vignetting applied to the ‚Äúalready cropped‚Äù image) for Lightroom 3 Beta 2, which was removed in the first beta version of Lightroom 3. A choice of 3 separate vignette styles appeared: Highlight priority, Color priority and Coloring the substrate. <br><ul><li>  <i>Highlight priority</i> - is the default style for the vignette and resembles the same effect as the optical vignette. </li><li>  <i>The priority of color</i> is a variation of the previous vignette style, designed to avoid a shift in hue in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãvignette. </li><li>  <i>Painting the substrate</i> is the original post-cropping style of the vignette, which was introduced in Lightroom 2. The effect is based on a graduated blend of black or white to create a vignette effect. </li></ul><br><h5>  Point-by-curve </h5><br>  Many photographers have asked to increase the number of settings when working with the tone curve, which currently allows work as with previous ‚Äúcontrollable‚Äù or ‚Äúphotographic‚Äù curves.  This release includes an option that includes the traditional point-by-point curve commonly used in the Camera Raw or Photoshop plugin.  Our goal in this implementation is to provide the advanced Lightroom users with the power and customizability they are looking for, without complicating the work of photographers just starting to learn digital image processing. <br><br><h5>  Crop orientation </h5><br>  Did you take a horizontal shot and realized that with vertical trimming it looks better?  It took a little magic to convince the Crop in the previous Lightroom version to change the orientation of the picture, but now you can just press the X key to change the orientation. <br><br><h5>  Process version </h5><br>  The process version determines which versions of Camera Raw image processing technology will be used when rendering and editing files.  Improving the quality of the image in this version is so fundamental to the visible results of changing the image setting that we needed the concept of the version of the process for the first time after the Camera Raw plugin came out in 2003. The process version allows Lightroom to keep the visual display of pictures identical to the one you have achieved in the past, but also Allows you to take advantage of the latest processing technologies by updating the snapshot display using the latest version process.  All images edited in Lightroom versions 1. * and 2. * are associated with Process Version 2003. Transfer of image processing to the latest processing technology is proposed, but depending on which adjustments are applied to the image, different image characteristics will change more noticeably than others.  For example, any images with sharpness and noise reduction adjustments will be affected most strongly, but the demosaic changes are applied to all images, so there will be some visual changes in all.  By default, your images will remain the same as they were, but if you want to take advantage of the latest processing technologies, you can update the process version to the latest by clicking on the notification icon in the lower right corner of the image.  (Or from the menu Settings -&gt; Process Version file menu available in the Develop module).  By default, all new files in Lightroom 3 Beta will receive the latest version of the process. <br>  We received quite a lot of feedback from photographers, embarrassed by the options version of the process in the first beta of Lightroom 3, so we made several improvements that are designed to ensure that photographers can access the absolutely best raw processing process quickly and easily: <br><ul><li>  The icon (so that you know that the image currently selected in the Develop module is displayed using a previous version of the process) has been enlarged and moved to a more prominent place in the lower right corner of the image. </li><li>  Clicking on the version of the process icon displays additional information about what will happen if you select the update to the current version of the process, allows you to see the image before and after the update process, as well as the ability to update all selected images or all images in the tape. </li><li>  Process version levels were renamed 2003 and 2010. The names represent the year in which the processing technology was presented.  This should give you an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãhow often we plan to update the version of the process. </li></ul><br><br><h5>  Water marks </h5><br>  A few watermark enhancements included in this release: <br><ul><li>  Additional text options - shadows have been added, including opacity, angle, offset and radius.  (Currently not available in Windows version) </li><li>  The location of the watermark can now be set by the positions of the relative anchor in the image or special inserts. </li><li>  The size of the watermark can be set in proportion to the indentation or filling the image changes. </li><li>  Watermarks are now available in the Slideshow module. </li></ul><br><h5>  Additional improvements </h5><br><ul><li>  A new slideshow option, a preview is calculated in advance, which ensures that the slideshow is not interrupted while waiting for the image to be displayed on the screen. </li><li>  Maximum print resolution has been increased to 720ppi </li><li>  The "Rotate to Fill" option and the "Rotate Cells" command have been added to the custom package of tools for printing layouts. </li><li>  Developers can now use ActionScript 3 galleries in a web module. </li><li>  In the 2010 version of the process, the algorithms for Fill Light and Highlight Recovery were changed to reduce the likelihood of tonal inversion.  You will most likely need to fine-tune these sliders after updating the process version. </li></ul><br><h4>  What's next? </h4><br>  We are much closer to the final version of Lightroom 3.0 and this beta version contains most of the improvements planned for this version.  However, we still want to receive your feedback on the latest improvements, and we still have a few new features in stock for Lightroom 3.0 release. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/88605/">https://habr.com/ru/post/88605/</a></p>
