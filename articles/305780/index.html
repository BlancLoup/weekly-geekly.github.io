  <section class="page js-page"><h1>New Tropical Data Center (TDC) Initiative</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  City-state in the south-east of Asia - Singapore in Malay means "city of the lion", often called "Disneyland for adults", "City of Prohibitions".  Favorable geographical position, well-thought-out development strategy allowed Singapore to become one of the most developed countries in the world.  An interesting fact is that every 10th resident of this state is a millionaire.  A microstate without resources is an economic giant with the most modern technologies.  Singapore leads the development of the business environment, ease of doing business and the work of e-government;  in the development of information technology and general competitiveness;  in IT competitiveness. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2dd/ad9/077/2ddad907754046dea9cb50e7a3ac6460.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The hard rule of dictator Lee Kuan Yew for 30 years led to the prosperity of the state, despite the fact that the situation was deplorable from the beginning: lack of resources, dependence on Malaysia in the supply of drinking water, prohibitive corruption and pro-communist sentiment among 30% of the population. <br><br>  More than 4 million Singaporeans use the Internet - this is 73%.  Singapore is ahead of its neighbors - Malaysia and Indonesia.  By the standards of Southeast Asia, there is a fairly high level of access to the Internet.  In 2006, the ‚ÄúIntellectual Nation 2015‚Äù master plan was launched, its implementation has allowed Singapore to become the world leader in ultrafast Internet penetration.  Singapore and Korea boast the highest percentage of data centers with ultra-fast connectivity, more than 1 Gbit / s, which are ready to meet the next generation requirements, such as virtualization and mobility.  World corporations such as Google, Amazon, IBM and many others have already placed their server farms in the territory of this state.

    <h3>  Tropical Data Center (TDC) </h3><br>  The island is located at the equator, so the climate in Singapore is flat and very humid, the state is in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãtropical monsoon climate.  Humidity reaches from 70 to 90%, in the daytime the air warms up to an average of 32 degrees, at night it cools to at least 20. <br><br>  Singaporean plans to test the world's first server farm, which will be designed specifically for the tropical climate.  The new Tropical Data Center (TDC) initiative is aimed at implementing this plan, and also aims to stimulate innovation and explore the possibilities for the application of environmentally friendly technologies in data centers. <br><br>  Developers are looking for new approaches to the deployment of server farm infrastructure in countries with hot and humid climates.  The goal is to create specialized software for data centers or optimize existing software solutions. <br><br>  For the experiment, the campus of the Keppel Keppel Data Center server farm was chosen; the project should start in the fall of 2016. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b50/63b/5b5/b5063b5b5ee44503a35cf39c31e9f52d.png"><br><br>  Such companies and organizations as Dell, Futjitsu, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Huawei, Intel, The Green Grid and Nanyang Technological University (NTU-Nanyang Technological University) decided to take part in the experiment, providing the necessary equipment, hardware, software.  During the experiment, the ‚Äúbehavior‚Äù of servers in various ‚Äúlive‚Äù situations, such as power surges, lack of temperature control or humidity control, will be checked. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cde/069/287/cde069287b524b98ae595baba2403d4e.png"><br><br>  According to statements by Singaporean engineers, as a rule, server farms are cooled to 20-25 degrees Celsius, and the relative humidity of the environment inside them is kept in the range from 50 to 60%.  The experimental TDC data center (while theoretically) will operate under much more difficult environmental conditions without additional energy consumption, which in turn will reduce energy waste by up to 40% and significantly reduce carbon dioxide emissions.  Reducing the energy consumption of the server farm infrastructure is paramount, because if you believe the statistics, their share of consumption accounts for 7% of the total electricity consumption of the country.  Due to the continuous increase in the number of data warehouses in Singapore by 2030, this percentage is expected to increase to 12. <br><br>  Back in 2014, there were attempts to develop new technologies for server cooling.  The Singapore Institute of Microelectronics (Institute of Microelectronics - IME) created the Silicon Micro Cooler (SMC) consortium, the task of the consortium members was to develop integrated solutions for controlling the temperature regime of various semiconductor chips with extremely high thermal packs.  At present, there is a tendency in the electronics industry to constantly reduce the form factors of products, expand their functionality and increase the speed of data processing, and this may lead to the appearance on the surface of powerful CPUs and other chips with a high thermal hot-spot package.  Because of this, there is a need to intensify the scattering of the heat generated by the chip under conditions of a constant decrease in its surface area.  But the high concentration of such ‚Äúhot spots‚Äù in small areas of the chip surface can cause a sharp rise in the transition temperature, which can lead to failure of the chips and electronic devices next to them. <br><br>  SMC, using the capabilities of the IME Institute, conducted research and development in the field of design support for thermal-hydraulic characteristics (thermal and fluidics design), deep trench etching and component connection at the wafer level bonding level.  Mechanisms have been developed for the organization of the heat sink, heat distributors made of synthetic diamond and graphene, silicon chips, hybrid micro-coolers, which cope with the heat generation of powerful processors, radio frequency amplifiers and laser diodes. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.datacenterdynamics.com/content-tracks/power-cooling/singapore-to-trial-first-tropical-data-center-in-q3-2016/96409.fullarticle">A source</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/305780/">https://habr.com/ru/post/305780/</a></p>
