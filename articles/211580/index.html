Need to keep a check.  Check, again, on the knowledge of physics.  A check from them is printed on a regular cash thermo-tape (I checked it in place).  I have a lot of checks in my office.  We copy them, because after a year or two they completely fade.  The oldest check that a colleague saw was held for 3 years in a folder in the archive.  <b>UPD</b> : look at the bottom of the topic, Ikea answered. <br><br>  <b>In general, we have a little shopping tour in debug mode</b> .  Sorry for some offtopic in relation to the current hub, but understanding some things requires basic technical knowledge and thinking. <br><br>  <b>Careful traffic</b> : under the cut a lot of finds with photos. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  A warning </h4><br>  I‚Äôll say right away that I don‚Äôt sell any of these products, in no way associated with him or his competitors.  I chose goods from the class of similar ones only because they were closer and more accessible on the shelf.  Well, or attracted my attention more neighboring.  The light did not converge on specific brands and articles - the analogs of the sea.  All judgments, in particular, regarding specific products and brands, estimated, I can mishap because of ignorance of the material part.  If I am mistaken - correct, please.  Below we will talk about my personal feelings and emotions.  Everything went. <br><br><h4>  "Now without asbestos" </h4><br>  On the product may indicate something very obvious that forgot to write competitors.  Here's a cholesterol-free oil that exploits the buyer's illiteracy: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ae3/e11/21f/ae3e1121f80d77e0fd3258580d91c72d.jpg"><br>  <i>And without nuclear waste.</i>  <i>It is strange that this is not indicated on the label.</i> <br><br>  Check on biochemistry: in vegetable oil, cholesterol simply can not be.  But you have to write.  Remember the comics, yes? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ac7/ba7/d33/ac7ba7d334815a2c53ee98edcb205fca.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Another example is sausages without soy.  Very roughly speaking, if you do not make them out of meat, then only two options remain - soy texture or fat emulsion.  So, on those without texture, it is logical to write that they are without soy.  The fact is that the buyer can decide that this statement is identical to the statement "from normal meat". <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3f7/f1f/9f0/3f7f1f9f037bb41ed1ec4733d79c926f.jpg"><br>  <i>Nice try</i> <br><br><h4>  Mimicry </h4><br>  You can disguise as a well-known class of goods.  For example, there is margarine, and there is butter.  It is enough to arrange the margarine as butter and not to write on it neither the word ‚Äúbutter‚Äù nor the word ‚Äúmargarine‚Äù.  Oppa, what is it with us? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/481/309/a4a/481309a4af28db559aefdd1ab78b0174.jpg"><br>  <i>First, appreciate the coloring.</i>  <i>Directly poured oil, huh?</i>  <i>Secondly, pay attention to the name - you will guess it only from the third attempt (it is on the price tag).</i>  <i>Genus name is very important.</i>  <i>Thirdly, the price tag itself.</i>  <i>Relatively recently, the standards have changed, and on the price list they made me indicate the type of product - in this case it is not an oil, but a spread.</i>  <i>But the law obliging to keep butter and margarine on different shelves somehow did not work.</i> <br><br>  Here is another example of mimicry: the product's own brand of the store is put in a pile of chocolates (if it were not STM, it would have been placed separately): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/21d/740/f63/21d740f63d8b85a3e95eb07987aeb34c.jpg"><br>  <i>Pastry bar without adding cocoa in the shelf with chocolate left and right.</i> <br><br><h4>  Carefully read the composition </h4><br>  We turn to deft movements with components. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cb3/0d4/221/cb30d42211b7520b1f05fd3efde4d3fb.jpg"><br>  <i>Caviar.</i>  <i>The word "delicacy" does not commit to anything.</i>  <i>Well, suddenly someone loves potatoes more than caviar, right?</i>  <i>After all, caviar is inside.</i>  <i>And the capelin on the cover was forgotten by chance, probably.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/459/bc2/4fb/459bc24fb45e031a4c611f3c743fc14b.jpg"><br>  <i>"No preservatives" - but citric acid in the composition.</i>  <i>The fact is that this thing is at the same time a flavoring agent, an acidity regulator, and a pretty strong preservative.</i>  <i>If it is attributed to the class of acidity regulators, the preservatives magically disappear from the composition.</i>  <i>Miracle!</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7c1/477/09b/7c147709bfa2a6c451a7d56628e94410.jpg"><br>  <i>I've always been madly wondering who these young bulls are at this price.</i>  <i>Well, I found out.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/324/fa3/b4c/324fa3b4ce8a66e7e27da0ff86e85aec.jpg"><br>  <i>It seems that "on the basis of" is "directly naturally from them."</i>  <i>I, of course, not special, but judging by the components, there are few cones there, but there is a well-known Sodium Laureth Sulfate and some elegantly named Aqua.</i>  <i>Sodium lauryl sulfate is a strong cleaning property that, judging by the wiki, can also be a strong allergen.</i>  <i>And the final touch - it seems, hair growth stimulates vitamin B6, and not the agent itself - well, judging by the packaging.</i>  <i>About vitamin it is not necessary to prove.</i>  <i>So what if the rest are not signed?</i> <br><br>  But the good old crab sticks.  And although they are not from the crab (which, it seems, everyone already knows), the manufacturer still honestly warns on the packaging that they are from fish: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9a5/aae/76f/9a5aae76fcb4590a8e7738a30016160e.jpg"><br>  <i>Just an established name</i> <br><br>  In <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/mosigra/blog/211580/">this</a> branch&gt; <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/vlt/" class="user_link">VLT</a> brings more examples. <br>  A <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/click0/" class="user_link">click0</a> expertly <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/mosigra/blog/211580/">talks</a> about products. <br><br><h4>  Names and terms </h4><br>  Now let's go buy some water.  If you get into the classification, it turns out that we are primarily interested in the word ‚Äúdining room‚Äù defined by the standard - to simplify, this is such water that a healthy person can use every day without restrictions.  Please note it is different from drinking.  Drinking can be drunk, and dining is a subset of drinking, drinking so much that you can drink every day, and there will be nothing for you.  Well, there is still a "medical-dining room", which can be drunk almost as often, if not a fan. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0a7/cf1/2ac/0a7cf12acf3f822953386a2e35896873.jpg"><br>  <i>Canteen.</i>  <i>They write from behind.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8bb/43f/a84/8bb43fa842b17ca18efe0365042eab87.jpg"><br>  <i>Another dining room.</i>  <i>They also write from behind without extra ponts (well, considering the price, it is quite understandable).</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/826/405/f71/826405f71077b17987a021c744bd1dda.jpg"><br>  <i>Too good, but you shouldn‚Äôt live alone on it for a year.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/839/854/806/839854806d347ecfc957a47042df641e.jpg"><br>  <i>And this is a marketer's talent.</i>  <i>The word "real" is not described in the standard, but it sounds cool.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c96/feb/9b5/c96feb9b5927920397131e9ca1c135dc.jpg"><br>  <i>Baby water?</i>  <i>What it is?</i>  <i>Is there water training?</i> <br><br><h4>  GOSTs and names </h4><br>  For this traversal examples could not be found.  I remember that I came across a beer with GOST for water purification on the label, plus candies, in which ‚ÄúNatural products‚Äù were written in large letters on the front side.  On the reverse, it turned out that it was LLC Natural Products. <br><br><h4>  We read under the asterisk </h4><br>  The girl drags me into cosmetics something to show: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/412/e45/f6d/412e45f6dbcaefbcb772e595a29ad860.jpg"><br>  <i>Correctly read so: "(Deep nutrition) and (moisturizing)."</i>  <i>Moisturizing is quite shallow.</i>  <i>So, only the surface of the skin.</i>  <i>But among the target audience there are no programmers.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/175/074/eb4/175074eb4b6a13464fab96becb212c83.jpg"><br>  <i>But about this, I did not even think.</i>  <i>Let's do it again: they promise me a noticeable result in two weeks.</i>  <i>How did they check?</i>  <i>They washed their heads with this thing and, attention, focus, one more other thing.</i>  <i>And these two things together had a noticeable result.</i>  <i>Almost perfect logic.</i> <br><br>  Reading the footnotes was very exciting.  Here is an example of the products: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/294/b98/48a/294b9848aeb1d83188297fc5ce236c6c.jpg"><br>  <i>Almost the same logic</i> <br><br><h4>  Exploitation of laziness </h4><br>  Here is a great example of aggressive laziness.  Packed expensive carrots on top, but if you fold 5-6 packets, you can see the usual.  I knew what to look for, because I needed a couple of carrots, and not immediately a pack. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/44c/a5c/925/44ca5c925be4e2880f2b5781580ccfc5.jpg"><br>  <i>While they do not nykayut carrots weighed, I just packed up.</i> <br><br><h4>  miscellanea </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bcb/069/2f5/bcb0692f552312463995be4ca6f2de77.jpg"><br>  <i>Colonel Sanders died in the 1980s.</i>  <i>UPD: <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/forgotten/" class="user_link">forgotten</a> in the comments</i> <i><br></i>  <i><a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/mosigra/blog/211580/">suggests</a> that he served as a private 3 months</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/234/52e/ae1/23452eae18faa55af59c238859e934d3.jpg"><br>  <i>Photo of the offer of the terminal, I added an arrow to attract attention to one of the points.</i>  <i>Added balance?</i>  <i>Catch advertising.</i> <br><br><h4>  Prices </h4><br>  Three times I bought goods more expensive, because under it was the price tag from another cheaper.  The most striking example is to ‚Äúconfuse‚Äù price tags for a large jar of green peas and a small one.  As part of the campaign, an example was not found. <br><br>  But here's your option cooler. <br><br>  <b>Point fast feeding</b> .  Look at the picture: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9f4/f80/4fd/9f4f804fdc1b7898893ad97dada74387.jpg"><br><br>  See the catch?  There is a pancake, there is a pie ... Everything is fine, yes?  But there is one nuance.  Strain your eyesight: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/80c/dc6/573/80cdc6573cc2f5a2dd4b843e6900adec.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/be9/8cb/afc/be98cbafc07c87e3fab3ac56da4837c9.jpg"><br><br>  That's about some of these different things, I hate some marketers. <br><br><h4>  What does the topic do in the corporate hub? </h4><br>  Very simple.  If you have previously read about the Mosigra here, then you know that we are trying to build a business so that it is not a shame for any aspect of it.  For example, it turned out to be a surprise for me that I was somehow mistaken simply because we did not send SMS to our thousands of clients who left a phone number and agreed to process PD.  Do you understand the depth of the problem?  Gratitude for what is considered within the company is simply the norm of honest business.  So here.  I want these things to cease to be something positive and become really the norm.  And I want, that I should not have to do "paranoia mode on" when buying products for dinner. <br><br>  UPD: Approximately 3 months after the topic was published, Maria Kiriyenko from Ikea contacted me: <br>  <i>For printing checks, IKEA uses biphenol-free thermal tape, which guarantees the safety of the check for 25 years, and, moreover, ensures its environmental friendliness.</i>  <i>To avoid possible misunderstandings, we decided to add information about the safety of the image on the check, provided that it is stored in a dry and cool place, in all communications about the guarantee, including the section on the website, booklets, the IKEA catalog and information on the check from the reverse side.</i> <br>  Thank you, it pleases. <br><br>  <b>UPD 2</b> : <br><blockquote href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/aingis/" class="user_link">  Aingis July 3, 2017 at 5:14 pm <br>  Successfully partially faded Ikeevsky check much later than this UPD.  Pretty quickly, moreover, in just 3 months. </blockquote></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/211580/">https://habr.com/ru/post/211580/</a></p>
