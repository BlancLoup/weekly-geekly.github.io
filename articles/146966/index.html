  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Build Hifidiy Mini USB DAC Mk2 Kit</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Good time of day.  After reading the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/132689/">post</a> I decided to try myself in such a <s>difficult</s> matter as self-assembly of an amplifier.  But to begin with, I wanted to try my hand and practice on something smaller and I decided to put together a DAC.  The choice fell on the <a href="http://shop2.hifidiy.net/index.php%3Fmain_page%3Dproduct_info%26cPath%3D10_24%26products_id%3D109">Mini USB DAC Mk2</a> from <a href="http://en.hifidiy.net/">hifidiy.net</a> . <br><img src="http://shop.hifidiy.net/images//20110804/50d12ed9c606fed7.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  Order </h5><br>  March is in the yard, knee-deep gypsum on the leg and at least 2 months of sick leave ahead.  I hoped that in a month he would come and brighten up the evenings with an exciting experience.  Order through <a href="http://mall.hifidiy.net/">mall.hifidiy.net</a> failed because of the failure of the store.  I contacted the seller, specifying my address, he issued a verdict: <br>  $ 109 (device) + $ 42 (shipping) + $ 6 (PayPal fee) = $ 157 <br>  I clarified whether there is a difference if I order via <a href="http://www.ebay.com/itm/HIFIDIY-Mini-USB-DAC-MK2-kit-upgrade-version-headphone-amp-/320919141472%3F_trksid%3Dp4340.m1850%26_trkparms%3Daid%253D222002%2526algo%253DSIC.FIT%2526ao%253D1%2526asc%253D11%2526meid%253D339403506270000881%2526pid%253D100011%2526prg%253D1005%2526rk%253D1%2526">ebay</a> where the price is $ 149.99 and free shipping, to which the seller replied that there is no difference and that he is ready to make a discount of up to 150 even if I pay through PayPal, which I did.  Immediately after payment, I notified the seller about it, he clarified the address and the name of the recipient and sent it the next day.  Delivery was carried out by Air of China post, in Russia - Russian Post.  Tracking number attached.  I paid on March 30, he sent 31 and already on April 4 the parcel received the status ‚ÄúExport‚Äù.  To my regret with this status, it hung up until May 2, and I received it only on May 14. <br><br><h5>  Parcel </h5><br>  It was packed neatly in a fairly dense cardboard box with thick foam inserts.  The delivery box seems to be patty pretty, as the corners were rounded. <br>  Content: <br><ul><li>  body </li><li>  front and back panel </li><li>  pay </li><li>  component package </li><li>  Power Supply </li><li>  manual (if you can call it that) </li></ul><br>  The case and the panels were wrapped with a thin soft material, so as not to scratch. <br>  The power supply is designed for 220-240V, but with flat contacts, so you have to use an adapter. <br>  Contents of the package with components. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d19/a8d/844/d19a8d84473953fd64c25fe418d017ae.jpg"><br>  The manual is a 2 sheet A4.  On one, all the diagrams are rather finely depicted, on the second - a list of components and their quantity and a small explanation about which components have a designation on the board. <br><br><h5>  Assembly </h5><br>  In the "instructions", for more detailed information on the assembly, offered to use the section <a href="http://en.hifidiy.net/html/AI/">asembly instructions</a> on the site.  However, there I did not find information on this model.  Googling also did nothing.  I found it for an <a href="http://www.hifidiy.net/index.php%3Fm%3Dcontent%26c%3Dindex%26a%3Dshow%26catid%3D25%26id%3D18">older model</a> , I looked out there.  Well, on the <a href="http://shop2.hifidiy.net/index.php%3Fmain_page%3Dproduct_info%26cPath%3D10_24%26products_id%3D109">page in the store</a> .  I clarified whether the seller has instructions, to which he received the <a href="http://222.73.161.158:8000/DIY_Production/200909/t20090921_2063.htm">coveted link</a> , but that was already after I finished the assembly.

      Immediately make a reservation that in electronics I am not special and I rarely solder.  There are several SSOP elements on the board, some with very small legs, and I hoped that they would be mounted on the board by the factory method.  But the board came absolutely clean. <br><img src="http://222.73.161.158:8000/DIY_Production/200909/W020090924426690783647.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>(photo from the manual, the board looks a little different)</i> <br>  I watched <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DLNXzseq71nk">video lessons on soldering SSOP</a> , asked people from the forum easyelectronics.ru, and realized that this is not an easy task and you can mess up and spoil the board.  He asked <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/marchenkovdmitry/" class="user_link">marchenkovdmitry</a> for <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/marchenkovdmitry/" class="user_link">advice</a> , and he suggested a good idea to charge a fee, for example, in cell phone repair, there are more experienced people there and they do it every day.  So I did, took the board with the components to repair the equipment, and the next day, giving n rubles, took the finished one. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/235/9a2/031/2359a203111c14cb2c1f063df8a43d06.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/79b/55d/4af/79b55d4afa729a656c60e577da79d45b.jpg"><br>  It remains to choose a free evening and proceed. <br>  The first solder resistors and diodes. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/0b4/764/280/0b47642808a4ef45d8d035063b34575b.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7ee/e93/0b8/7eee930b88708cc1b20584e987b720fa.jpg"><br>  <i>(I apologize for the quality of the photo)</i> <br>  Then go to the capacitors and the rest of the components. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/12e/1fd/ee9/12e1fdee9665807abf70b79eccd2f3a7.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/51b/221/7d5/51b2217d50eb5424c0ef9a210e60e2e8.jpg"><br>  Well, at the end of the solder input and output jacks, volume control and the rest. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d6d/0fc/75a/d6d0fc75a0c344d2a834fe74be86a9dc.jpg"><br>  In fact, nothing complicated.  Collected slowly for 2 pm. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/0db/16a/98d/0db16a98dfced04651fb22c1e13373a6.jpg"><br>  When soldering he used flux-free flux and solder for HiFi components (with silver). <br>  Who is interested in soldering, please (do not kick, I'm not a pro): <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3e3/c27/29f/3e3c2729fcfd6975219128d4fa1335cf.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a96/17e/321/a9617e321e2aad2746b5c6eacffa53d7.jpg"><br><br><h5>  Tests </h5><br>  As soon as I finished the ration, I immediately wanted to try it.  Without collecting the case, I connected the power button and the power supply and turned it on.  The power diode did not catch fire, was a little embarrassed and decided to assemble the case as well.  He assembled, connected to a computer, he immediately discovered a new device and began to download drivers for it.  Reboot and voila - a new output device.  I barely plugged in the headphones (the adapter from 6.3 to 3.5 was not included, and I found it not very comfortable) I began to listen.  The test launch was on a working laptop, which was not particularly music, so chasing online ringtones.  With no signal, there was a slight noise in the left channel, but overall it sounded good.  I decided to exclude the headphone and adapter factors and try them on home acoustics (there was no benefit to the family at home). <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/8e6/852/aa8/8e6852aa85456acabefbb5305e758e2a.jpg"><br>  It has already sounded in all its glory. <br>  Again consulted <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/marchenkovdmitry/" class="user_link">marchenkovdmitry</a> .  He said that the noise is most likely due to flux (dirt and solder residues), and the diodes are off, because the polarity is confused.  So it turned out.  I disassembled everything, cleaned the board, re-soldered the diodes and everything worked as it should. <br>  Photos in the interior: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/325/f06/d3f/325f06d3f78ce4d45d421e7edf2bdc75.jpg"><br><br><h5>  findings </h5><br>  I am pleased.  Got a good device, the pleasure of assembly and +5 to the experience of soldering.  Maybe it was a little expensive, and it was possible to assemble a <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/131922/">cheaper and better device (in class A)</a> .  But, again, I repeat, I am pleased with what happened to me. <br><br>  <i>In retreat</i> : <br>  The Mini USB DAC Mk2 has a class A mode, but when switching, the sound is very very quiet.  I asked the seller a question on this topic, I have not received an answer yet.  <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/marchenkovdmitry/" class="user_link">Marchenkovdmitry</a> thinks that more powerful nutrition is probably needed. <br><br>  <b>UPD</b> : <a href="">device map</a> . <br><br>  <b>UPD 2</b> : From the <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/gadfly/" class="user_link">gadfly</a> hint <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/gadfly/" class="user_link">,</a> it turned out that the device <b>does not have</b> class A, and this switch serves to select the source of the signal for amplification, digital or analog.  The quiet sound that is heard when switching is likely to pickup. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/146966/">https://habr.com/ru/post/146966/</a></p>
