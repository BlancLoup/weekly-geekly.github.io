Each - his own.  In this article I want to consider serious calculators with the ability to build graphs for iOS, and specifically for the iPad. <br> <a href="http://pix.academ.org/"><img src="http://pix.academ.org/img/2011/12/20/c65b286882f479188e5085c7007968ba.png"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  As soon as I went to college and ran into a mate.  analysis, I realized that I never need a helper.  But this assistant can not be a banal calculator.  It would be nice if he could count integrals, decompose a function in a Taylor series, and build nontrivial graphs.  It is worth noting that at the time of the start of training, I already had an Apple iPad 2 tablet. He became my assistant. <br>  The tablet itself cannot do anything, so our task is to investigate the <b>AppStore</b> for the presence of applications interesting to us.  In this article I will try to describe several applications that seemed to me the most interesting.  Some, indeed, can play a significant role in the learning process. <br>  I will not focus on the design, since functionality is more important to us, and good applications on iOS are rarely ugly. <br><br>  We formulate some requirements for an ideal application: <br><ul><li>  -Specialized keyboard </li><li>  -Adequate "builder" charts </li><li>  -Autonomous work </li></ul><br>  For the ideal, you want to take <b>Wolfram Calcus</b> , which provides all this except for autonomous work (Internet access is required).  I will consider this application at the very end, because I consider it the most interesting. <br><br><h5>  iMathematics </h5><br>  I want to start with it, as I‚Äôm going to increase the utility of programs. <br>  The application icon looks like a notebook with the letter ‚ÄúPi‚Äù (I don‚Äôt know why, but the developers love to put this symbol on the icons), by itself it is free, but some functions are closed, the cost of ‚Äúunlock‚Äù of some functions is $ 1.99, and the Pro version is $ 2.99 .  Let's see what the Free-version offers us. <br>  The application has two tabs: Form and Utilites.  The first one is a reference book on the main mathematical sections that ‚Äúsucks‚Äù information from Wikipedia. <img src="http://pix.academ.org/img/2011/12/20/d327aa6feb4ee4f3b33f65810efaf7e5" alt="image">  Personally, I don‚Äôt see any sense in this part of the program, since Vicky rarely provides a serious theory and it is always preferable to use textbooks that are given out - it‚Äôs more reliable.  The Utilites tab contains much more interesting things. <h6>  Calculator </h6>  - I really did not like it, it was made with some kind of zakos for engineering, but the implementation and usability leave much to be desired. <img src="http://pix.academ.org/img/2011/12/20/13dc4f4b69cc3d922ba5e1c7122ea1e7" alt="image"><h6>  "Solver" of equations </h6>  - solves only quadratic equations, it is useful except for the 6th grade student (or when quadratic equations pass there ...) <h6>  Fraction Calculator </h6>  - write a decimal fraction, specify the maximum order of the denominator and get a simple fraction, also useless. <h6>  Advanced Calculator </h6>  - oh-pa!  We fall into a terribly uncomfortable mini-browser with access to <b>WolframAlpha</b> .  Thanks, we can do it ourselves. <img src="http://pix.academ.org/img/2011/12/20/160959d93cdbc53c95daeeb225080ce0.png" alt="image"><br>  Well, the other functions, such as graph builder, equation system solver, matrix solver and Quick Form mysterious, are closed in the free version.  Judging by the screenshots in the <b>AppStore,</b> they are the same poorly implemented utilities as free ones.  Well, this application is not worthy of the attention of a student who has already stopped solving school problems.  The only fun and maybe even useful feature is the ability to draw in the margins.  Free space is enough for this. <br>  <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/imathematics!/id337535181%3Fmt%3D8">iTunes - iMathematics!</a>

    <h5>  Free Graphing Simbolic Calculator - PocketCAS lite </h5><br>  Free, the same letter "Pi" on the icon.  Builds only graphics.  There is a built-in specialized keyboard, it is quite convenient to use it, which cannot be said about the application as a whole.  Simple graphics builds, and thanks for that. <br>  Demanding something complicated is not worth it.  Personally, I was not able to finally understand the program, which makes further comfortable and fast work with it impossible.  Why are only my torment to remove the already constructed schedule.  It's a pity.  The very idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe program is wonderful. <a href="http://pix.academ.org/"><img src="http://pix.academ.org/img/2011/12/20/039b1d0cc1d75c4244c28c95e7b1e091.png"></a> <br><br>  <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/free-graphing-symbolic-calculator/id333261649%3Fmt%3D8">iTunes - Free Graphing Simbolic Calculator - PocketCAS lite</a> <br><br><h5>  Free graphing calculator </h5><br>  As the name implies, it is free and all functionality is immediately open.  This program is already very close to my requirements and I want to call it ‚Äúserious‚Äù. <br>  Here we have eight tabs. <br><h6>  Calculator. </h6>  Here we see a REAL engineering calculator with a simply amazing number of functions.  It makes no sense to describe everything, but believe me, they should be enough for you.  Conveniently, the old calculation results are not deleted - the last four are visible.  Management of brackets is also well implemented - the set does not slow down, everything is fast and clear. <a href="http://pix.academ.org/"><img src="http://pix.academ.org/img/2011/12/20/e7b0e11464b96fa7a68fb04ce9146f06.png"></a> <br><h6>  Equations. </h6>  Here you can see 4 fields where you can enter any functions and equations using all the functions of the calculator.  Everything is just as convenient and fast. <br><h6>  Charts </h6>  Here, the graphs are constructed according to the equations already entered in the previous tab, they are highlighted in different colors, the axes can be scaled and moved as it is convenient for us. <a href="http://pix.academ.org/"><img src="http://pix.academ.org/img/2011/12/20/178558b4a89a0b1f2374795ac3a850c3.png"></a> <br><h5>  Reference. </h5>  As the name implies - reference material on the basic rules of various sections of mathematics.  They are so many that even too lazy to view everything. <br><h6>  Table. </h6>  Clear.  Shows some values ‚Äã‚Äãof the entered function. <br><h6>  Solver of triangles. </h6>  Enter the length of the sides - we get the angles.  It can be the opposite.  (Again, the function is likely to be useful only in school, though ...) <br><h6>  Solver square equations. </h6>  Similarly. <br><h6>  More. </h6>  Everything related to settings and other information. <br><br>  What we have?  This is a worthy app, one of the best, can help at a critical moment. <br>  <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/free-graphing-calculator/id378009553%3Fmt%3D8">iTunes - Free Graphing Calculator</a> <br>  But in the <b>AppStore</b> there is a paying version that offers even more wide functionality.  It <b>costs</b> $ 1.99 and is called the <b>Scientific Graphing Calculator</b> . <br><br><h5>  Quick graph </h5><br>  One of the best apps in my opinion.  The free version looks like <b>PocketCAS lite</b> with its idea, but all this is implemented much smoother and more convenient.  Allows you to build only graphics, but the possibilities associated with them are very many.  You can immediately display up to six graphs (in the paid version for $ 1.99 there is no such limitation), select them with different colors.  The workspace is of course scaled.  You can build graphics in 3D.  It is possible to save as a picture in the gallery or immediately send by mail.  Available there is enough detailed help on using the program.  Extended keyboard included. <a href="http://pix.academ.org/"><img src="http://pix.academ.org/img/2011/12/20/0e5da9f57d9c635e1615eb500dc09a1a.png"></a> <br> <a href="http://pix.academ.org/"><img src="http://pix.academ.org/img/2011/12/20/4211687aa9bd1df29f1348b357260fc1.png"></a> <br>  <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/quick-graph/id292412367%3Fmt%3D8">iTunes - Quick Graph</a> <br><br><h5>  Wolfram calcus </h5><br>  This is the only paid application from my list.  But it costs its $ 2.99 and pays them off in full. <br>  I hope everyone knows the incomprehensible possibilities of the <b>WolframAlpha</b> service.  So, this application is an ideal tool for working with it.  Unlike the usual search line, here we have a division into main sections, in each of which there is an extended control of a function.  For example, taking a derivative, we can set its order, expanding the function in a Taylor series, you can choose the accuracy of the decomposition.  I will go through the main sections of the program: <br><ul><li>  Routine calculations </li><li>  Piece of function graph (gap can be set).  Builds graphics of any complexity.  That's what he and Wolfram. </li><li>  Limits </li><li>  Differentiation </li><li>  Integration </li><li>  Rows </li><li>  Sequences </li></ul><br>  Almost in each there are subsections specifying the task.  Of course, there is an advanced keyboard with special characters that simplifies and speeds up data entry.  The only disadvantage, weighty enough, is the requirement of the Internet, which reduces our mobility. <br> <a href="http://pix.academ.org/"><img src="http://pix.academ.org/img/2011/12/20/2258b073a338a0ef6c1c82f7be125cf7.png"></a> <br> <a href="http://pix.academ.org/"><img src="http://pix.academ.org/img/2011/12/20/4a8119ddba07d5418b0d774a86af8926.png"></a> <br> <a href="http://pix.academ.org/"><img src="http://pix.academ.org/img/2011/12/20/83578fecaee603204bc6443911de90f9.png"></a> <br>  <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wolfram-calculus-course-assistant/id410594105%3Fmt%3D8">iTunes - Wolfram Calcus Course Assistant</a> <br>  There is an even more functional application from <b>Wolfram</b> , it costs more and has more functions, but I cannot say anything concrete about it. <br>  <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wolfram-multivariable-calculus/id428100167%3Fmt%3D8">iTunes - Wolfram Multivariable Calculus Course Assistant</a> <br>  Well, let's summarize.  In the <b>AppStore</b> there are not so many applications of this type, but they are there, there are plenty to choose from.  There are free, there are paid, all with their pluses and minuses.  But everyone should choose himself, depending on the needs. <br><br>  PS I only stated my opinion on this issue and, I hope, it will help someone to make a choice. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/134935/">https://habr.com/ru/post/134935/</a></p>
