Deputies consider the definition of such devices not very clear, so by the second reading they decided to finalize the documentation. <br><br>  The amendments are being developed in order to avoid situations where buyers of GPS trackers or video glasses are prosecuted.

      According to the clarification, a spy gadget can be called ‚Äúdevices, systems, complexes, devices, special tools and software for electronic computers and other electronic devices, regardless of their appearance, technical characteristics, and operating principles, which are intentionally given qualities and properties for providing the function of covert (secret, non-obvious) information acquisition or access to it (without the knowledge of its owner). " <br><br>  The FSB received a comment that the same pen with a hidden camera itself is not a spy gadget.  But if you use it for covert shooting, it will already be a violation: the shooting cannot be conducted without the consent of the person. <br><br><h3>  Telecom operators continue to test eSim </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/596/290/6d3/5962906d3dd546c8eb967892a8e3b51f.jpg"><br><br>  Immediately, several mobile operators of federal importance <a href="https://habr.com/ru/news/t/448132/">are testing eSIM technology</a> .  These are Rostelecom, Tele2, MTS, Vimpelcom.  At the same time, MTS, Vimpelcom, Megafon claim that the introduction of technology will lead to a decrease in company profits.  Considering that Russian companies have to spend money on installing equipment to comply with the norms and rules of the ‚ÄúLaw of Spring‚Äù and ‚ÄúAutonomous Runet‚Äù, this means a significant reduction in the amount. <br><br>  At the same time, the FSB is in favor of a complete ban on eSIM, since the law enforcement agencies are developing a project to create Russian SIM cards with domestic encryption technology.  In foreign smartphones such technology is unlikely to be able to integrate. <br><br>  The Ministry of Communications and Mass Media believes that technology is needed and it will appear gradually, the main thing is not to hinder its implementation. <br><br><h3>  Artificial Intelligence Defeated Dota 2 World Champions </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f00/d8e/f95/f00d8ef9561605bf816345b296c0eb4d.jpg"><br><br>  OpenAI has <a href="https://habr.com/ru/news/t/448138/">won the Dota 2 professional players</a> dry.  This is a battle with the team OG, which last year won the top prize in eSports.  She won first place in The International tournament on Dota 2. The prize fund of this tournament is $ 25 million. <br><br>  During the battle, artificial intelligence constantly attacked the enemy.  The possibilities of AI were somewhat limited (for example, they set a delay on clicks) in order to equalize the capabilities of people and machines.  This brought both tactical and strategic victory.  The duration of the first match was 30 minutes, the second - even less, about 20 minutes. <br><br>  For the first time, the OpenAI bot was launched into the gaming arena in 2017, at the 2017 International Championship. Then it beat Danil Dendi Ishutin in a 1vs1 match on Shadow Fiend.  Then the company introduced the AI ‚Äã‚Äãteam, which was ceded by paiN Gaming and the national team of professional players of the Chinese scene on TI8. <br><br><h3>  Mark Zuckerberg may be removed from the post of chairman of the board of directors of Facebook </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d62/7af/960/d627af96097ac32ad28dec0f9fe1aaff.jpg"><br><br>  Facebook shareholders are <a href="https://habr.com/ru/news/t/448158/">unhappy with the company's current performance</a> .  She immediately got into several informational scandals involving the use of data from her own users.  Shareholders submitted to the vote 12 proposals that relate to the introduction of changes in the current scheme of the company.  One of the changes is an amendment to the Facebook charter that implies the appointment of an independent chairman of the board of directors.  In this case, Mark Zuckerberg leaves one of his posts. <br><br>  ‚ÄúWe believe that this weakens Facebook‚Äôs governance and governance oversight.  The selection of an independent chairman will allow the CEO to focus on the management of the company, and the chairman on the supervision and strategic leadership, ‚Äùthe shareholders' message says. <br><br><h3>  Apple and Qualcomm have settled a patent dispute </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/187/a00/cdc/187a00cdc6c517cec09af15f81127ea0.jpg"><br><br>  Apple and Qualcomm <a href="https://habr.com/ru/news/t/448468/">were able to resolve a $ 27 billion patent dispute</a> .  The conflict began in 2017 and lasted until the end of March 2019. Now the partners have entered into a license agreement for a period of six years, it entered into force on April 1 of the current year. <br><br>  Now, Qualcomm will supply its chips for iPhones, and Apple will be able to easily sell devices in any country of the world.  Earlier, the courts of China and Germany have banned the sale of Apple smartphones that violate patent agreements. <br><br><h3>  Samsung Fold for $ 2000 quickly break </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3f2/2f0/ee4/3f22f0ee489ca791e3fa800f1231ed5a.jpg"><br><br>  Journalists from several major publications complained that the samples of the foldable Samsung Fold smartphone began <a href="https://habr.com/ru/news/t/448646/">to fail within a few days after receipt</a> . <br><br>  In this case, the damage does not resemble each other.  In some cases, the screen stops showing any image.  Sometimes part of the screen is working, part is not.  In one case, a bulge appeared at the bend, which led to a quick display failure. <br><br>  Samsung Corporation has promised to deal with problems in their gadgets.  Previously, the company reported that the number of flexions that are safe for availability is 200 thousand </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/448724/">https://habr.com/ru/post/448724/</a></p>
