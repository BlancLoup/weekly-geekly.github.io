Not so significant article about the conference itself, how many comments to it, as of November 2012, ‚ÄúArticle from 2006, but people still do not realize the effectiveness!‚Äù.  We think that you can leave exactly the same comment dated 2016 - and this is not because something is wrong with technology, but because it developed against the backdrop of a virtual PBX boom and remained in the shadows. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/be1/b09/fb1/be1b09fb1b9c36511c4c97fa329ed31d.jpg"></div><br>  Services based on FMC technology have been found in the corporate services portfolio of cellular operators since about 2010.  However, the services were advanced difficultly, partly because it was more profitable for the operators to implement other solutions, partly because subscribers did not receive information about the benefits and advantages of FMC, and they did not even know what kind of technology it was.  In fact, there is something to talk about, especially for small and medium businesses.  In general, as the bronzed copywriters write: ‚ÄúYour employees are not mobile enough?  Then we go to you!". <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The article will discuss Fixed Mobile Convergence / FMC and how this technology is related to the Telfin <a href="http://www.telphin.ru/telefoniya-dlya-biznesa/fmc/%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr.ru%26utm_medium%3Dreferral%26utm_content%3Darticle_s%26utm_campaign%3Dc_0916">Mobile Employees</a> service.  In developing the service, we are faced with interesting moments and subtleties.  We are sure that it is worth telling about them. <br><br>  According to a <a href="http://json.tv/ict_telecom_analytics_view/konvergentsiya-mobilnoy-i-fiksirovannoy-svyazi-fmc-v-mire-i-v-rossii-tekuschee-sostoyanie-i-perspektivy-20150326095643">study by</a> J'son &amp; Partners Consulting, ‚Äúdespite the fact that the FMC corporate services market in Russia has been developing for more than 10 years, its volumes remain quite modest - less than 1% of the total number of corporate users of mobile communications.  Nevertheless, at present, good prerequisites have been created for more intensive development of the FMC market in Russia with market growth rates exceeding the growth rates of mobile and fixed communications in the corporate segment.  The industry has mainly gone through the processes of consolidation of mobile and fixed-line operators, operators are actively looking for ways to increase ARPU and profitability, including through convergent services, and the benefit from FMC is quite obvious for corporate users. ‚Äù

    <h2>  Freshen up the terminology </h2><br>  FMC (Fixed Mobile Convergence, Converged Communication) is the integration of mobile / mobile / GSM telephony with a corporate telephone exchange, an intracorporate network with a single numbering plan and uniform call management rules for office and mobile phones.  Generally, if we talk about the convergence of networks, then in fact it is the convergence of various networks: mobile communication (also known as cellular), public telephone networks (what they used to call the city telephone), IP-telephony.  This means that services are created at the interface of technologies, using various elements of the infrastructure. <br><br>  The remaining terms, in principle, are already known to almost everyone, but just in case, we recall that they mean: <br><br><ul><li>  Mobile communication (it is cellular, GSM) - mobile communication accessible from a mobile phone in areas where reception is available (coverage); <br></li><li>  Fixed communication - a telephone connection between telephone users, via wired connections and IP-telephony, with access from a fixed terminal; <br></li><li>  Terminal - user terminal equipment (telephone, smartphone, computer, etc.), a device with which access to communication services is possible (in our case); <br></li><li>  An extension number is a short number assigned to users for access during an external call and for transferring a call (often the same as an internal one); callers dial it immediately after the organization number or IVR message, wanting to get on the phone of a specific manager; <br></li><li>  Internal number - short numbers assigned to users for calls within the office (for example, an accountant calls the director by dialing 007, and the director calls the system administrator 666). <br></li></ul><br>  What does FMC give?  More on this will be below, but for now a few examples that each encountered. <br><br><ul><li>  You can call both internal extension and long numbers through the corporate network.  In this case, all work calls can be sent through the platform, record and monitor. <br></li><li>  You can have a mobile extension call at the same time as an office extension.  And it is possible that with a lag of 5, 8, 30, n seconds.  Although no, n is too much, take k. <br></li><li>  You can customize the reception of calls on days of the week, do a check on time, on the employment of employees, on priorities.  Algorithms are all possible. <br></li></ul><br>  To sum up briefly, specifically in our case, this is the embedding of employees' cell phones into corporate telephony, that is, the coverage of the entire working (and sometimes non-working) time and all official conversations. <br><br><h2>  We know what a headache is in business. </h2><br>  Whatever the business, the main thing that he has is employees, customers and product.  And in almost any company there is a group of people facing one of the most difficult tasks: to be the employee who will sell the product to the client (retail, buyer, wholesaler, dealer, network is no longer important).  And there is a group of problems that are guaranteed and can be solved in 99% of cases with the help of technology. <br><br><ul><li>  Client attachment to a specific manager.  Often, the buyer himself prefers to communicate with only one employee.  And the employee may leave, go on a business trip or get sick.  In principle, no one has canceled mobile communication, but to be honest, not a single manager will be pleased with such communication: on the one hand, there is no control over the status of the transaction, on the other - monitoring the activity of an out-of-office manager can lead to a premium, increase etc. <br></li><li> Difficulties in the separation and payment of working and non-working minutes of an employee.  Suppose he called on a hospital from Moscow to Chelyabinsk and uttered 600 rubles for work, and spent another 700 on the mobile Internet through which he watched a movie.  To establish the amount to be reimbursed, you need to have either a special corporate tariff, or wait for the billing and print the history of calls and other paid transactions, choose the ones you need and pay. <br></li><li>  Difficult CRM integration - loss of part of customer calls, call history.  Incomplete information about the interaction can lead to problems in working with a specific client, data loss, deadlines. <br></li><li>  As a result - a vague estimate of the company's communication costs.  And this means that it is quite difficult to find ways to optimize. <br></li></ul><br>  The critical moment is the absence of a single information field of the client, the need to force him to find the right manager.  Each additional call can lead to the loss of a client, because this is his time, which is not subject to inflation and has long been worth much more than money.  The problem is particularly acute for companies operating in the field of B2B and B2G - here the question of business reputation is at stake. <br><br><h2>  How it works </h2><br>  The service is compatible with any office PBX, including the <a href="http://www.telphin.ru/virtualnaya-ats/%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr.ru%26utm_medium%3Dreferral%26utm_content%3Darticle_s%26utm_campaign%3Dc_0916">Telfin.Offis PBX</a> .  The service has a federal scale of coverage, or rather, there is where there is a cellular connection of the operator, whose SIM card participates in the convergence scheme.  To activate the service, it is necessary to buy new operator SIMs, because with a high probability on the already connected SIM cards, the FMC service is not connected.  At the same time, there will be no problems on the part of Telfin - we are setting up telephony remotely, conducting electronic document flow.  If the company has an extensive network, and the service is needed in several branches, then we can conclude an agreement from the central office for services in the necessary regions. <br><br>  After the bureaucratic paragraph - to the point. <br><br><h3>  FMC Logic </h3><br>  Let us analyze in the diagram what exactly happens when the Mobile Employees service is connected. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6b6/739/46a/6b673946aa71a51fe848d491cf6a9194.jpg"><br><br>  In the picture it is easy to make out the concept of FMC: <br><br><ul><li>  Client network - F, Fixed (in the case of fixed telephony in the office). <br></li><li>  Beeline Network - M, Mobile, a network of mobile operator. <br></li><li>  The Telfin junction connecting F + M is C, Convergence. <br></li></ul><br>  PSTN - public telephone network, includes any external numbers with which the company interacts.  Now, when calling from a mobile to a public network, the call goes through the PBX.  An external subscriber saw the number of the company.  The conversation is recorded.  Call data was received by PBX and other analytics systems. <br><br>  A similar scheme works in the opposite direction, only the arrows are reversed.  A call from the outside, arriving at a mobile employee, sends the correct data of the caller to the company's PBX. <br><br>  Will the scheme change if there is no fixed / fixed telephone connection in the office?  Will not change.  Client's PBX can be part of a virtual PBX Telfin, traditional PBX, Asterisk or something else.  The essence is the same: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/640/c8e/627/640c8e627b0c48b45fa72d4ac8f33e06.jpg"><br><br>  If the client uses a hybrid solution that combines a virtual and an iron PBX, then the FMC scheme is also feasible: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/28b/271/522/28b271522776ad0d3a13f31f1544d775.jpg"><br><br>  Summary.  Whatever the corporate communications network, after setting up calls from mobile networks will be able to go through the corporate network.  Now all the phones, even cellular, have become part of a corporate-wide voice communication network.  Mobile phones received an internal number. <br><br><h3>  How to take a call from FMC-sims </h3><br>  First, let's remember how we take a call using an extension associated with an office phone.  The incoming call to the city number of the company falls into the voice menu.  And if there is an additional extension (for example, 200), then this call falls on the person "on the table."  The desk phone rings, the person picks up the phone and starts a conversation.  But if a person eats lunch or goes on a business trip, the desk phone rings and rings.  Already felt this overwhelming irritation? <br><br>  Lunch, a business trip, and often a cold sick-list in a tough business world have ceased to be a reason not to answer calls, so over time they began to turn on redirection.  Now, when the office phone rings, in two or three seconds the cell phone rings.  What does a person see on his mobile?  The number of your own company, from where the redirection went.  As a result, in the case of a missed call, it is difficult to understand who called.  In addition, call forwarding is recorded in the PBX as an outgoing call to a mobile (although initially it is an incoming call, which should also go down in the history of relations with the client).  Bottom line: confusion, who and when called, it is difficult to find a call to the PBX, there is no mark on the conversation in CRM, there is no call recording. <br><br>  Another way to save data about calls from cellular ones is to install a special application (soft phone, softphone) on the mobile.  Mark this softphone in the PBX as a separate internal number.  It will get better: and calls will be recorded, and the original number of the caller will be indicated.  But the softphone works only through the Internet, and if the connection speed drops or the person is outside 3G, 3G +, 4G networks, the conversation most likely will not take place, if only because of the quality of voice transmission. <br><br>  What happens when the Mobile Employee service is used?  We insert a special SIM-card, we connect the service.  And if before it was just a mobile number, now it will be a full extension, which, moreover, is easy to remember.  Previously, the number was "911-xxx-xx-xx", now it has become "200" and allocated separately in the PBX.  These three numbers are on the desk phone, on the softphone, and now they will be on the cell phone.  So mobile becomes part of the corporate network.  Now you can see who is calling - the initial number of the subscriber.  If I miss this call, then I call back as I used to - in one click on the number of the missed call.  If I want to clarify information with a colleague, I transfer the call from my mobile to an additional colleague.  I participate in conference calls, record conversations, keep statistics of calls ‚Äî all from a mobile phone.  Almost happiness and relative harmony. <br><br><h3>  How to dial additional mobile </h3><br>  If now I dial three digits from my mobile, the PBX will understand and transfer to a colleague with the corresponding additional number.  A colleague will see that he is being called not by an abstract mobile phone, but by me, from the extension.  Yes, mobile resources are used here, but this is still an internal call on the PBX (here it is, an accessible and simple convergence).  Conventionally, these are two phones inside of me, in the office, so I want to assign some numbers to it so that they are determined.  This is an internal connection, it does not apply to other telephone networks: I don‚Äôt transfer my two boxes, what I want, and I don‚Äôt give it to anyone. <br><br><h3>  Outgoing on work and personal issues </h3><br>  If you make an outgoing call to an external (relative to the office), cellular or landline numbers, it's time to apply the rules.  For the convenience of users, the following rule applies.  If you call via an asterisk (*) - you call for work, if through a plus (+) - then for personal matters.  Let us analyze what happens in each case. <br><br>  For example, calling the client.  From the mobile I dial the number with an asterisk: <br><br><ol><li>  Dialing mobile client in the phone: * 8-921-xxx-xx-x <br></li><li>  On the internal network with FMC-SIM, the call came to our PBX. <br></li><li>  The PBX routes the call to the PSTN network. <br></li><li>  The client saw the office number / PBX number. <br></li></ol><br>  If I call from a mobile on a personal matter - I want the company not to record (and if necessary, not listen to) personal conversations.  I dial the usual number without an asterisk, starting with a plus: <br><br><ol><li>  I dialed the number of a friend: + 7-921-xxx-xx-xx. <br></li><li>  The call goes over the Beeline network to the Megafon network, in this example. <br></li><li>  A friend sees my usual mobile. <br></li></ol><br>  This separation of calls is not accidental.  External personal calls do not go through the PBX and are not recorded.  The company does not keep third-party conversations, and the employee does not experience persecution mania.  It is logical that on whose network the call went, so it is charged.  Those calls from +7 are personal calls.  The personal SIM card owner pays for personal calls, as they go through the mobile network of the cellular operator (the cost depends on the selected package from the mobile operator).  What begins with an asterisk (*), - goes within the framework of the Mobile Employees service, is charged as part of the Telfin service fee. <br><br>  <i>How it connects</i> <br>  A contract is concluded with us and the cellular operator, SIM cards are connected, routing rules and integration with corporate programs are defined.  With existing SIM cards setup takes one day. <br><br>  In the interface of the PBX "Telfin.Office" there is a mobile extension if the client wants to configure the "Mobile Employees" independently. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3e6/250/c46/3e6250c46f927922a0965765c4ea2409.png"><br><br>  To enable the service: <br><br>  1. Open in the PBX "Settings", the item "Employees and queues." <br>  2. Go to the settings of the extension, which is allocated for the mobile. <br>  3. Select the extension "Mobile employees", specify the mobile number. <br>  4. Click "Save." <br><br>  If a user fails or questions arise, we will always help.  First, save the client setup time.  Secondly, let us evaluate the convenience of our implementation of FMC and make adjustments if the market needs to change the functionality. <br><br><h2>  Severe Russian case </h2><br>  One customer came with such a request.  In the area where he works, big problems with the Internet, and landline, and mobile.  In addition, employees of the company's loyalty program issued smartphones, which they gladly use as the main phone for both personal and business communication.  More than half of the employees are in constant traveling on customers and dealerships, they need to answer customer calls, fixed telephony does not help.  We needed a solution for GSM, which, moreover, was supposed to ‚Äúmake friends‚Äù with server CRM. <br><br>  They transferred employees to FMC-sims with a corporate tariff, activated the Mobile Employees service, waited for the effect, which became immediately noticeable. <br><br><ul><li>  The costs of the company and employees for communication decreased, a clear division of the cost of calls appeared. <br></li><li>  It became convenient to call, all the numbers are determined, the information about the calls is written, the data falls into CRM. <br></li><li>  The number of missed and unanswered calls has decreased.  Telephony as a whole has become more transparent. <br></li><li>  Reduced the time of the transaction due to the rapid communication. <br></li><li>  The quality of work with clients has increased - managers are notified that ‚Äúfor the purpose of quality control, all calls are recorded‚Äù. <br></li><li>  Recorded calls have become an excellent training base for existing managers and newcomers - training takes place not in theory, but in real negotiations. <br></li></ul><br>  Gradually, the client went on complicating the office communication scheme: those who wanted could have two cell phones and, for example, receive calls for one in the morning and another for daytime, and set up voice mail for e-mail for clients from another time zone for the night.  At the same time, there were no difficulties in accounting and analysis.  And, of course, the main thing that surprised the client, but we are accustomed to: office telephony (with a mini-PBX, recording calls, splitting bills) correctly worked where there were no conditions for this. <br><br><h2>  Pleasant bonus: call the order number </h2><br>  Mobile is now a full-fledged part of the corporate network, like other equipment.  Therefore, we get new functionality in our mobile: combining telephony with CRM. <br><br>  <i>Example.</i>  <i>The customer is waiting for the courier.</i>  <i>When a client calls to the company, the incoming number is being checked.</i>  <i>If this number is found in the client base, then the call according to the specified algorithm is immediately sent to the courier.</i>  <i>The courier is late, but is in touch and ready to talk to the client.</i> <br><br>  Another option is an interesting option - a direct call from CRM to the order number.  In life, it looks like this.  An employee has an order number (for pizza delivery, taxi call, mailing).  He dials the order number directly on the mobile, presses "call".  The PBX finds the order number and the client's phone number in CRM, connects the employee with the client. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a46/96f/b6a/a4696fb6a4d5f9c6e612ec10888c41e7.jpg"><br><br>  The Telfin. Office office has 15 ready-made integrations with IT products (plus an unidentified number of third-party self-written integrations).  Store data on calls from cellular to PBX, attach mobile calls to the client card in CRM, see the entire history of communication with the customer, and not fragmentary data from the employee.  Now it has become possible. <br><br>  The scheme works not only for the order number and work in CRM: <br><br><ol><li>  We type some numbers after the asterisk, press the call. <br></li><li>  There is a request to connect from a mobile phone to our network Telfin. <br></li><li>  Knowing the rules of dialing, the PBX understands that this is not a phone number, but some code (order number, customer code, contact support, cat feeding time). <br></li><li>  Then the PBX sends a signal to the action: make a call, mark the status, send data. <br></li></ol><br>  The principle of what may be additional has changed, the customer experience has changed, so new functions have now been earned on the cellular.  But before that, on the desk phone we did so in order to dial the order number, nothing has changed here.  But on a mobile phone it is more necessary, because this service is interesting for traveling managers, couriers, taxi drivers.  We take the human experience of using a mobile phone and try to apply it to the functionality of PBX and computer telephony, which is already there. <br><br>  There is a temptation to say that such a service will solve all the problems of the company, sales will grow, costs will decrease <s>, and hair will become shiny and silky</s> .  Surely a tangible economic effect will follow, but we will be realistic.  The service provides, above all, the transparency of corporate communications, convenience, simple deployment and independence from the speed of the Internet connection.  In addition, this is a worthy offer for those whose employees are often located outside the office or are remote.  And transparency, control, and accessibility are important business values ‚Äã‚Äãtoday.  Competitors are not asleep, you should not give a client without a fight - just because of a couple of unanswered calls. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/241/019/ab3/241019ab318f49cebebbd7a97e7834c8.jpg"><br>  Author: Alexander Krasnikov, Technical Director Telfin </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/309208/">https://habr.com/ru/post/309208/</a></p>
