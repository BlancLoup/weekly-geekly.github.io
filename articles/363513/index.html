    </i>  <i>Today we would like to talk about the features of preparing for IELTS - to find out what are the most common ways of preparation, what are the advantages and disadvantages of each of them, and also to share useful links and suggest textbooks that will make the preparation more effective.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>And as always, we ask you to write your wishes and comments in the comments.</i>  <i>Thank!</i> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  There are several ways to prepare for the test in English IELTS - group lessons, individual lessons (in-person or using the online platform), online programs, as well as self-study.  Before you start preparing for this serious exam, we recommend to find out which method of training will be effective for you.  The most suitable option is the help of a qualified teacher who will assess your level of English proficiency, and then, based on the data obtained, will draw conclusions about which teaching method will be the most optimal for you.  However, the type of training can be chosen independently.  We advise you to carefully study all the advantages and possible disadvantages of the existing IELTS preparation methods. <br><br>  <b>Group IELTS exam preparation (courses)</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/91e/5f3/ffe/91e5f3ffe93f459cb8772b7263d5286e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The main advantage of this type of training is the possibility of a detailed study of the structure of the upcoming exam under the guidance of experienced teachers at an affordable price.  You can also familiarize yourself with samples of possible assignments and thoroughly work out each of the four parts of the IELTS test. <br><br>  The disadvantage of such training can be called the need to respect the general pace of study and class schedule, as well as the lack of an individual approach to each student. <br><br>  The group method of training is excellent for those who a) just start training and want to master the theory of the test, b) speak the language well and are disciplined enough to work through all the tasks themselves after the course. <br><br>  <b>Individual preparation for the IELTS exam</b> <br><br>  The advantage of this type of training is the possibility of self-selection of the duration and intensity of training.  In addition, the curriculum is developed taking into account your level of knowledge and the result you want to achieve. <br><br>  The minus of individual training can be called the high cost of classes and the lack of opportunities to work in a group, learn from the mistakes of others, or vice versa, excellent answers.  A group is also an element of competition.  In private lessons you are one-on-one with a teacher, so you only compete with your best result. <br><br>  <b>Online IELTS exam preparation</b> <br><br>  The main advantage of distance test preparation is the ability to work from anywhere in the world.  In order to start learning, you only need access to the Internet.  Classes are conducted using interactive tests and textbooks with the necessary grammar and lexical material. <br><br>  The disadvantages of such training include the complete lack of teacher control over the learning process.  If you do not have enough motivation or need clarification for each task, this way of learning is not for you. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2d1/af7/d67/2d1af7d673654d1a80f32fab92c1b5ad.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>IELTS test preparation by Skype</b> <br><br>  The undeniable advantage of this training is the same comfort as with online training, but with interactive.  In addition, the teacher can fully prepare you for the exam, focusing on all possible errors. <br><br>  The disadvantages of training on Skype are classes that require the personal presence of the teacher.  Also bad internet can interfere with the Speaking section. <br><br>  <b>Self-preparation for the exam</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9bf/e14/446/9bfe14446d214b34a274a81cc8b0fa8f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The main advantage of self-training is the ability to conduct classes at any time convenient for you and without large financial costs.  You will only need to purchase the necessary books and audio materials. <br><br>  The disadvantages of self-training is the complete lack of control over the learning process.  You may also have some difficulty finding a partner for speaking practice. <br><br>  In self-preparation for the IELTS exam, there is no possibility of getting professional advice. <br><br>  The participation of the teacher is essential in preparing for IELTS Writing (written part) and IELTS Speaking (oral part). <br><br>  Only an experienced teacher will be able to correctly draw up your training program, as well as follow the learning process, gradually increasing the workload and evaluating your knowledge in accordance with the exam requirements. <br><br>  However, the choice of teaching method is strictly individual.  It depends only on you how to prepare for the exam.  But remember that the right strategy is the key to success. <br><br>  <b>Useful tutorials for preparing for IELTS</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e3d/4e4/981/e3d4e49818244b5b910d817647450827.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  To date, developed a large number of diverse literature, focused specifically on those who want to pass IELTS.  All these books and manuals can be used both for training courses and for self-preparation.  However, it should be borne in mind that each IELTS textbook has its own purpose, so it must be chosen strictly for individual requirements.  So, all the educational literature on the market is conventionally divided into several categories, and it is the student who decides which one to choose. <br><br>  Now there are a lot of books aimed at getting acquainted with the exam itself.  They describe the format of IELTS, the strategy of its passage, the features of sections and tasks, as well as give useful tips and tricks.  For example, the books 101 Helpful Hints for IELTS, Strategies for Study, and Insight into IELTS.  Such literature is ideal for exploring the requirements and features of IELTS, it helps to determine your own strategy for passing this test and learn about the possible difficulties that may arise during the exam. <br><br>  To a separate category of special literature to prepare for testing include manuals with practical exercises.  Such books contain tasks of various types and complexity from different sections, as well as correct answers, hints and detailed explanations.  For example, ‚Äú202 Useful Exercises for IELTS‚Äù, ‚ÄúCambridge Practice Tests for IELTS‚Äù, ‚ÄúIELTS: Practice Now‚Äù and many others.  These manuals will be an excellent option for passing practical tasks during the preparation for the test. <br><br>  The best tutorial for IELTS is universal.  It should contain both useful information about the exam itself and practical tasks.  Such are the accomplices of Kaplan IELTS, Oxford IELTS Masterclass and Barron's IELTS.  These books are considered to be the best literature for preparation, as they contain a lot of useful information about the structure of the test, its tasks and requirements, as well as many useful tips and exercises for practice. <br><br>  <b>IELTS Test Tests</b> <br><br>  It is very important for candidates for IELTS to get a good experience in the performance of tasks of various types.  And for the realization of this goal, it is the <a href="http://ielts-test.ru/probnyj-ielts.html">test tests</a> that contain exercises typical for the test and time limits that are ideal.  With their regular passage, a student can study the specifics of the tasks of each section more thoroughly, test their knowledge and gain invaluable practical experience in passing the sections, taking into account the limited time. <br><br>  It is impossible to pass the test test IELTS online entirely, only its individual parts.  This is because the test consists of 4 parts: Listening, Reading, Writing and Speaking, of which only two can be checked by a computer (Listening and Reading), and the other two (Writing and Speaking) cannot even be theoretically checked for the computer.  In practice, all parts of the test are checked by people, and when IELTS is taken, it takes 10 working days. <br><br>  Why use online IELTS tests <br>  ‚Ä¢ it is possible to pass test tests both at home, and at work, and on rest - in any place where there is Internet, <br>  ‚Ä¢ automatic calculation of points for the exam gives a real idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe current level, <br>  ‚Ä¢ creating your own test is available: you can pass both a simulated real exam and a training test or diagnostic, <br>  ‚Ä¢ the candidate has the opportunity to feel time pressure.  This experience will help to cope with the time limit on a real exam. <br><br>  The disadvantages of the online IELTS tests are that they do not accurately evaluate the essay (only by basic criteria) and do not evaluate Speaking at all. <br><br>  <b>IELTS online tests:</b> <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ <a href="http://www.examenglish.com/IELTS/index.html">www.examenglish.com/IELTS/index.html</a> (on the right side of the site). <br>  ‚Ä¢ <a href="http://www.testden.com/challenge/free-ielts.asp">www.testden.com/challenge/free-ielts.asp</a> (simple registration is required). <br>  ‚Ä¢ <a href="http://takeielts.britishcouncil.org/prepare-test/free-practice-tests">takeielts.britishcouncil.org/prepare-test/free-practice-tests</a> (several practical tasks). <br>  ‚Ä¢ <a href="http://www.roadtoielts.com/area1/RoadToIELTS2/Start-AC.php%3Fprefix%3DTD">www.roadtoielts.com/area1/RoadToIELTS2/Start-AC.php?prefix=TD</a> (full online tutorial from the British Council). <br>  ‚Ä¢ <a href="http://olpt.s3.amazonaws.com/online-practice-ielts-ac/index.html">olpt.s3.amazonaws.com/online-practice-ielts-ac/index.html</a> (trial test from IELTS.org). <br><br>  Finally, <a href="http://ielts-test.ru/skachat-ielts.html">here</a> you can find links to a variety of materials for download on the IELTS test. <br><br>  <i>In the next publication we will talk about the features of registration for the exam and the procedure for passing IELTS.</i> <br><br>  The author of the article is Vyacheslav Davidenko, founder of <a href="http://www.mbaconsult.ru/">MBA Consult</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/363513/">https://habr.com/ru/post/363513/</a></p>
