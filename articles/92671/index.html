      - according to the insider information of all "unlimited" by any means it is necessary to force to switch to "Consumption Profiles".  More expensive, more uncomfortable and more irrational.  This is done very simply.  From March 1, they unilaterally changed the contract, setting the following clause in it: ‚ÄúConsumers served in the Unlimited‚Äù and ‚ÄúNew Unlimited‚Äù packages (speeds up to 1 and 2 MB, respectively), after reaching consumption volumes of 70 and 120 gigabytes per month traffic is transferred to a consumption rate of 128 kb and 56 kb, respectively. "This is done for the sole purpose of unloading city lines that cannot cope with the subscriber base that still remains. <br><br>  One can argue for a long time about the legal subtleties of this phenomenon, but the stupidity of this decision is amazing.  So, after reaching nearly 65 gigabytes of traffic in the first 2 weeks of the month, the question arose - how to live on.  Half-hour searches on the network revealed non-tariff resources for Volia subscribers. <br>  And file sharing, and media warehouses, and other familiar attributes. <br>  The flow of consumed traffic even increased compared with the first weeks of the month.  Those.  The initial task - to unload the channels by reducing the speed of access remained unsolved.  The situation has even worsened.  The reasonable question about the sanity of the person who approved the data change, and remained hanging in the air. <br>  Respect?  Loyalty?  It looks like these words have their own special meaning for the staff of Volia. <br><br>  - Loyalty programs were introduced.  Do you know what they are?  Pay for the next month before the 10th day of the current month and we will send you to Egypt.  Three stars, not a season and then when it will be convenient for us.  We do not refund money.  Not only pay in advance, so also send you only when we want. <br><br>  - conditions of access to the statistics system were changed.  The forum was buzzing for a long time, wondering how to get into the "personal account".  By the method of scientific spear they all decided.  Why yourself?  So the call center was not aware of the provincial changes in access conditions. <br><br>  - on the ‚Äúcompany‚Äù channel every hour there is a ‚Äúappeal of the main in the province‚Äù, in which this ‚Äúspecially trained person‚Äù convinces subscribers that everything is really good, but the competitors ... On trifles like a stutter reading from paper and a look rather to the left camera lens, we will not stop. <br><br>  - Deposit terminals began to take their 5% per transaction.  Attempts to clarify the situation stumbled upon the impenetrable - "We have changed the corporate policy."  The question is why then they don‚Äôt take a commission from your competitors, but was left unanswered. <br><br>  - unrestrained rudeness and arrogance of employees, the truth refers to the problems of the old, not newly acquired. <br><br>  PS: Yes, I still can not change the provider for six months.  Competitors: <br>  a) the networks reached out, but they will connect no earlier than mid-autumn; <br>  b) do not intend to connect your area to the network in 2010; <br>  c) the ubiquitous Ukrtelecom provides the service of deliberately disgusting quality (which, by the way, honestly warns you at the consultation); <br>  d) mobile providers cannot provide either speed or volume. <br><br>  ZYY: Out of a dozen close friends, another person is still tortured by the will.  All others have already been saved.  It remains for me to hope and wait. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/92671/">https://habr.com/ru/post/92671/</a></p>
