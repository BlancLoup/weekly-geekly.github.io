It was this conclusion that four experts at the Adobe Summit this year made to discussions about how they contribute to their organizations in the field of digital advertising. <br>  <b>A senior direct marketing manager at the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, Rebecca Sisson,</b> said that when she started her work five years ago, the company did not perform any email activity and did not work in social networks.  Her main task was based on what needs to be done from scratch in order to introduce digital technologies into the art museum. <br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúThe first task we did was not exciting: we just built the database,‚Äù says Rebecca.  ‚ÄúWe needed to collect all this scattered information in different systems, such as buying tickets, paying for food and parking, which, in addition, had little in common, and organize one single information space.‚Äù </blockquote><br>  Instead of investing money on high-tech products for immediate interaction with the audience, for example, on iPads, Sisson believes that it was more important to build a reliable base. <br>  The pressure exerted on the marketing team, which was supposed to make changes and involve the consumer, could not be satisfied without making the first investment in the creation of the database. <br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúWe could not start with a grand and brilliant ball in the first minute;  first we needed to build a foundation, ‚Äùadds Rebecca. </blockquote>

      <b>Adobe's operations and analytics manager for display advertising, Matt Scharf,</b> said that the primary task of working with digital advertising in the ‚Äúiceberg project‚Äù was to cope with inefficiency around visualization. <br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúThe concept of a light bulb appearing above your head is incorrect.  Much more light when you start on a winding and ornate path that opens new standards and leads to innovation, ‚Äùsays Matt.  ‚ÄúFor me, there is no direct way between creating an idea and realizing innovation.‚Äù </blockquote><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúWhile associations and the industry are focused on the growth of views and the creation of valuation standards, the tacit problem is that marketers are still investing in advertising that will never be seen by the final consumer,‚Äù says Scharf. </blockquote><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúThe iceberg was a project that was supposed to isolate all unnecessary advertisements at the cookie level, going deep into the water to eliminate ads that would never be seen, and push the ones that have a chance to influence the consumer positively,‚Äù explains Matt. </blockquote><br><br>  <b>Brian Wong, founder and head of mobile advertising startup Kiip,</b> reports that his mobile marketing company has been launched to determine the moment of achievement of the consumer.  The idea was that initially the company was focused on games, but then quickly expanded to fitness, finance and professional content. <br>  According to Brian, it is time for evolution, when you can use technology not only to understand when it is easier to reach new customers, but right now we can start building closer and more trusting relationships with our customers. <br>  And what is important is that, through experimentation, knowledge allows us to look at the advertiser-consumer relationship in a slightly different way, introducing more and more new ways to reach a customer, for example, by offering you advertising when you drive to a gas station using the Internet. . <br><br>  <b>Jerry Jao, head and co-founder of marketing consulting company, Retention Science,</b> believes that many brands do not have enough communication with consumers.  And the innovation of his company lies in how you can be closer to the consumer. <br><blockquote>  One-on-one travel is what they say in our field.  A little later, we see with whom we came in contact, and what products and services they use.  All these "moments of truth" or small signals that force us to study consumer behavior.  We observe people, and then we create innovations and bring in creative things around it.  Our innovation is not creating innovations, but in following the consumer, ‚Äùsays Jao. </blockquote><br><br>  [1] Illuminating light bulb - in this text it implies the moment of the emergence of a new idea, which is often illustrated in the form of a lit light bulb overhead. <br><br> <a href="http://www.byyd.me/ru/register/%3Futm_source%3Dmegamozg%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3Dcontent_marketing"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/041/3c5/29a/0413c529a1424210a02b160e54a40e80.png"></a> <br><br>  <a href="http://www.byyd.me/ru/%3Futm_source%3Dmegamozg">BYYD ‚Ä¢ Mobile Advertising Platform</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/295614/">https://habr.com/ru/post/295614/</a></p>
