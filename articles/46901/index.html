Search engine optimization seems to me a kind of shamanism, when a person finds a rope hanging from a tree and, pulling for it, gets a banana.  After that, a person searches for like-minded people and together they try different ways of jerking - two long jerks and one short jerk with the rope being led aside, and so on.  - to increase the number of falling bananas.  For some time I have been tired of talking about this shamanism. <br><br>  When a week ago Sergey ( <a href="https://habr.com/ru/users/s13/" class="user_link">s13</a> ) knocked on me in ICQ and offered to conduct a seminar on search promotion, I was even a little confused.  Just a couple of months ago, I would love to talk about all the technical aspects of promotion and optimization, the compilation of the semantic core and other crap.

      Last year, a small group of ten people had to give a course on some kind of modern Internet technology.  I decided not to do this and instead of learning scary cuts like FOAF, ATOM and RSS, we analyzed simple (at first glance) psychological cases.  I tried to show how the human perception is arranged and what difficulties the techies can face when transferring their errors to the head.  After some time, I learned that my lectures had changed the life of one of the listeners.  One out of ten - a good exhaust. <br><br>  Since I don‚Äôt have such an opportunity right now, I‚Äôll try to stay within twenty minutes to tell you about the three rules.  The rules that I try to follow last year.  Rules that I hope will help you.  So, the first rule - <h4>  "Do not piss!" </h4><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  We are led.  From kindergarten and school, to the army, university, work, first position, family at 25, child at 26, second position, promotion, one more increase, pension, coffin.  We are sailing from stage to stage, and between the stages we are forced on the illusory choice: ‚ÄúWhere it is better to enter - GrSU or BSU‚Äù, ‚Äúfor programming or for psychology‚Äù.  This choice, which does not ask the question ‚ÄúIs it necessary?‚Äù, The choice of the level ‚ÄúWhich is better to listen to - Verka Serdyuchka or Tanya Bulanova‚Äù.  Both are crap. <br><br>  Why do Microsoft campuses look like campuses?  To graduates streams poured into the friendly ranks of slaves, "maykroservov." <br><br>  Why do you need such a system?  In order for people to be predictable.  The state knows that at twenty, people either study or serve, at thirty, they raise children and pay a loan for an apartment.  The state tells you: "You have a stable position" <br><br>  I know that half of you are now working at Epam, and the other at Itransition.  Work at work for the money.  I think you are objective.  Is it possible to consider a stable situation when you have a job?  Can?  [ <i>silence</i> ] I will rephrase it: Can a situation be considered stable when your life depends on the words of one person (‚Äúyou are fired‚Äù)? <br><br>  Due to the fact that you are slaves, the state is sustainable. <br><br>  It is easy to identify such "resistant".  Sometimes they come to me to get a job.  When you ask such people - ‚Äúdo you have your own projects that you did alone or with a small team of friends, in your free time, not the previous employer‚Äù - they answer ‚Äúno‚Äù.  When you ask them to show their own code, they say that they have not written a single line of code for themselves.  At 17.30, when the working day ends, they put on a jacket and go home.  These are consumers for whom the highest achievement of all life is plasma on the wall and a new mobile phone with a five-megapixel camera. <br><br>  These people have never had their cause.  Cases with a capital letter.  They only deal with the affairs of others.  When I say ‚ÄúCase‚Äù, I do not mean business and do not talk about money.  Now we are doing the <a href="http://blog.coderab.com/">project "Doshirak"</a> .  We do not have people who pay us a salary.  We do not need them.  <a href="http://blog.coderab.com/deneg-bolshe-net-skuchnyj-finansovyj-striptiz/">There is enough on the nobility.</a>  We have chosen two niches, and we are doing in them original, bright projects, such as we ourselves would like.  At the same time, not only the result is important for us, but also the process.  Go to the site, join, drive enough for everyone. <br><br>  Not pissing is less of a risk.  You do what you want.  Besides, it's fun. <br><br>  It seems to you that you still know little about the Cause?  It seems to you that for a start it is better to work for someone to gain experience?  They will not teach you.  Starting in the fourth year of work for a company that carried out orders for Panasonic, I understood two things - you know everything, and you know nothing.  When you come to BAT, you think you know nothing (and want to learn everything).  This is not the case - the fact that you know enough to do your work.  Otherwise you would not have taken.  Congratulations, your career is over, <a href="http://lurkmore.ru/Just_as_planned">just as planned for the</a> next 10 years you will sit on your ass and work as a monkey coder.  Then you will be thrown out on the street, hiring a younger and faster brain, and you will go to the university <i>as a teacher</i> [the <i>teacher and employee of Itransishena <a href="https://habr.com/ru/users/ghostwhite/" class="user_link">ghostwhite</a> snorts "something you simplify everything ...".</i>  <i>The job is this :-)</i> ]. <br><br>  So, you know everything a slave needs.  And how do you even know about the world around you?  A television?  Newspapers?  What if <a href="http://davydov.blogspot.com/2008/12/blog-post_09.html">television is lying</a> ?  Not because it is <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/minsk_by/1399229.html%3Fmode%3Dreply">false</a> , but because those who work there are mistaken.  A person is a repeater, journalists and reporters studied at the same universities with you.  Do you think they know or can something that you do not know? <br><br>  Maybe you think that everyone can not be mistaken?  Let's do two experiments. <br>  <b>Situation One</b> : How do you know others?  Imagine a cafe.  For example, such as in our university.  All the same - the same tables, the same distribution queue.  Food on pallets, coffee machine, chocolates, cola in the refrigerator.  With one small difference - there is no cash.  At the exit there is a box in which you can drop money.  And not the same as that of the <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_Procedure_Call">ROC</a> in the shops (so that the little things are not sp.zdil), but open.  You can put a large bill and collect change.  Each visitor can leave any amount that seems fair to him.  You can not pay today if there is no money, but tomorrow bring debt.  Submitted?  Will this cafe be profitable?  [ <i>A few voices from the hall "No".</i>  <i>I: ‚ÄúAnd who would not pay?</i>  <i>So you personally would not pay? ‚Äù</i> ] Let's define the rate of profitability.  For 100 percent, we take the amount that the cafe receives, if it has a cash desk.  How many percent of this amount will make a profit out of the box?  [ <i>The most daring estimates from the audience: 20-30 percent</i> ]. <br><br>  <b>The second situation</b> (better known as the Milgrem experiment, known not only to the creators of social networks, fans of social networks).  How much do you know yourself?  Imagine that you were invited to participate in an experiment to evaluate the effect of pain on thought processes.  You are introduced to the subject, who is then taken to the next room and put on an electric chair.  You do not see this person, only hear what he says into the microphone.  You have in your hands a device with a voltage regulator and a scale from 15 to 450 volts.  The experimenter gives you a list of questions and you read them into the microphone.  You are reading the first question.  The apprentice answers.  Second question.  Third.  On the next question the student is mistaken.  The experimenter says that you need to turn the knob to the ‚Äú30‚Äù position and press the button.  Having received an electric shock, the student laughs: ‚ÄúIs this a punishment?‚Äù. <br><br>  The experiment continues.  More complex questions and more stress follow.  A student starts screaming at a hundred volts, demands to stop the experiment at two hundred, he yells for two hundred that he has a bad heart, then wheezes into the microphone and stops answering questions, at three hundred volts he just howls, and only silence is heard from the microphone. <br><br>  The question is: which one of you would bring the experiment to the end, up to 450 volts?  [ <i>silence</i> ] Well, what mark would you get to?  [ <i>called estimates in the region of 100-150, one, the most courageous, says: 300</i> ] <br><br>  Rule two <br><h4>  ‚ÄúCheck everything in practice‚Äù </h4><br>  This means not to make preliminary, unconfirmed assessments.  Before the experiment, Milgrem surveyed professional psychologists who assessed that no more than 20 percent of the subjects would continue the experiment to half and only one in a thousand would increase the voltage to the limit. <br><br>  Okay, I will not torment.  The real results were as follows: no one stopped at half (220 volts), and 65 percent ‚Äî almost two thirds ‚Äî completed the experiment.  In the case of a cafe (and there really is such a cafe, and not one) - they receive about 130% of what they would receive with a working cash desk. <br><br>  Eighty percent of the figures taken from the ceiling are false.  Including this figure eighty.  Including your preliminary assessment. <br><br>  So you know nothing about yourself or others.  So what's the difference when to start?  Anyway, Epam does not teach. <br><br>  Do something else.  Do what you always want to do.  Or do something that you would never expect from yourself.  Do not try to figure the numbers on paper - just grab and do. <br><br>  Biologists say that mutations are useful for a population.  Some of them will not be needed, some will be harmful, but some of them will fall into the gene pool and develop the necessary skills. <br><br>  And the third rule <br><h4>  "Do not be sad shit" </h4><br>  Do not focus on programming.  Life is not java, si-plus-plus and kanterstrike.  This year I finished the <a href="http://t-styl.info/novae/fotarepartazh-z-adkryccja-szmzh-11.html">school of a young journalist</a> (and got the indulgence to write online and swear) as a person who is afraid of cars, got the rights, bought a metal detector and is now <a href="http://blog.coderab.com/kodiruyushhie-kroliki-ishhut-klad/">looking for a treasure</a> , and despite the fact that doctors did not recommend me to raise more than five kilograms, almost a year doing bodybuilding and doing a <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A1%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D1%2582%25D1%258F%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B0">deadlift</a> with a hundred. <br><br>  Take care of what has been postponed for a long time.  What they wanted to do.  Get started today.  Now.  Begin, because tomorrow you turn on the TV and forget about what I said. <br><br>  Thank. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/46901/">https://habr.com/ru/post/46901/</a></p>
