We go to work or study.  After we go to the store, we take a beer or juice and, tired, we go home to rest.  Coming home, we read Habr, we watch TV and we dream that the wife / girl / mother keeps silence for a little while.  Surely writing about it is much more unpleasant than experiencing in reality, but everyone needs a variety, be it a movie, billiards, bowling or a shopping trip. <br><br>  <b>Quest.</b>  The adventure, which requires the player to solve mental problems in order to advance along the plot, is simply a treasure for lazy people.  Thinking with pleasure is a goal pursued by all the creators of quests. <br><br><img src="http://img820.imageshack.us/img820/2599/28501114.jpg" alt="image">

      <a href="http://mobiquest.ru/">Mobicvest</a> saves people from the <b>routine</b> by helping them create ‚Äúlive‚Äù <b>quests</b> using their platform.  You just need to come up with a scenario for your adventure, and the platform takes on the technical part. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Scenario </h4><br>  Any scenario is a general idea, separate tasks (puzzles) that need to be performed in stages or in isolation, and tags that help to navigate the quest. <br><br><h5>  Idea </h5><br>  Each script begins with an idea.  For example: " <i>In the footsteps of great writers</i> ."  The adventure takes place around the houses or places where Russian writers lived and visited. <br><br><h5>  Tasks </h5><br>  Next on the idea are strung prototype tasks.  There are three main types of tasks (all the rest are their combinations): <br><ol><li>  <b>Research</b> .  Member need to find information. <br>  For example: <br>  ‚Äú <i>In the house of Leo Tolstoy an important principle was written in the courtyard, which the writer followed during his whole life.</i>  <i>What is this principle?</i>  "; </li><li>  <b>Competitive.</b>  The participant needs to complete the task as quickly as possible.  For example: <br>  ‚Äú <i>Count the chairs in Bulgakov‚Äôs house.</i>  <i>You have 2 minutes for this task</i> ‚Äù; </li><li>  <b>The rebuses.</b>  We need to solve the riddle. <br>  For example: <br>  ‚Äú <i>I erected a monument not made by hands.‚Äù In the museum of the author of these lines you will receive the following task</i> . ‚Äù </li></ol><br><h5>  Tags </h5><br>  After that we liven up the invented script by adding tags. <br>  A label is a noticeable object or an inscription for which you can catch on when composing a task or answering a task.  For example: <br><ul><li>  ‚Äú <i>What is written on the 3rd column of the Bolshoi Theater?</i>  " </li><li>  " <i>From the tree with a hollow in the form of a maple leaf, take three steps to the North and dig</i> " </li></ul><br><h4>  Technical implementation </h4><br>  After that, the <a href="http://mobiquest.ru/">Mobicvest</a> platform comes into <a href="http://mobiquest.ru/">play</a> .  Important steps in creating an adventure (tabs): <br><br><h5>  Information tab </h5><ul><li>  <b>Adventure code</b> <br><br>  Necessary for participants to take part in the adventure.  Sent by SMS or driven into the appropriate field via the web interface ( <a href="http://m.mobiquest.ru/">m.mobiquest.ru</a> , <a href="http://mobiquest.ru/">mobiquest.ru</a> ) </li></ul><ul><li>  <b>Adventure type</b> <br><br>  <b>Quest</b> - you need to compete with other players and solve riddles.  Associated with moving around the city; <br><br>  <b>Quiz</b> - competition with other players, in which you need to answer questions, is not related to movement; <br><br>  <b>Excursion</b> - a game with an educational bias.  You need to answer questions related to the location of this type of adventure.  Associated with the movement. </li></ul><br><h5>  Script tab </h5><br>  Here you need to enter information that participants will receive at the very beginning of the adventure, and at the end when they complete all the tasks. <br><br><h5>  Tasks tab </h5><br>  The main part of creating an adventure.  Here the author brings in all the information that he invented in the second and third step of ‚Äúcreating a script‚Äù. <br>  There are two types of tasks: <br><ol><li>  <b>Photo tasks</b> - as a response, the participant must find, take a picture and send a specific object or image specified in the task. <br>  Example: ‚Äú <i>Find and take a picture on the 5th column on the right</i> ‚Äù. </li><li>  <b>Text task</b> - as a response, the participant must find the answer to the question indicated in the text of the task. <br>  Example: ‚Äú <i>Find a black door near the entrance to the museum.</i>  <i>What numbers are written on it?</i>  " </li></ol>  There are also some features to consider: <br><ul><li>  For the passage of the task, you can assign any number of points; </li><li>  The task can be tied to the map; </li><li>  For any text task there is an opportunity to add a hint so that the participant does not lose interest if he cannot complete the task; </li><li>  A participant can skip a task if he cannot complete it; </li><li>  The number of attempts to complete the task both before and after the prompt can be limited; </li></ul><br>  In general, this is part of the creation of the adventure.  It remains only to click "Publish" on the "Publication" tab, and you can start to go through. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/330/ed7/08a/330ed708a1aa493498f25de98a59cf09.gif" alt="click tracking"><br><br><h4>  Quest example - HTC Quest </h4><br>  From December 10 to December 12, 90 people ran around Moscow, completing tasks as part of the quest <b>HTC Quest</b> , jointly organized by <a href="http://mobiquest.ru/">MobiQuest</a> and <b>HTC</b> . <br><br><h5>  Preliminary stages </h5><br>  At the preliminary stage there were 16 adventures and 8 ciphers. <br><ul><li>  <b>Ciphers</b> are tasks that could be performed without leaving the house.  Connected with HTC and Android platform. </li><li>  <b>Adventure</b> - tasks for which the participant had to go to the city. </li><li>  <b>Photo</b> assignments - tasks in the city, in response to which we took photos. </li></ul><br>  The main communication tool between the platform and the participants was a special widget located on the blogs of partners such as <a href="http://droider.ru/%3Fp%3D5066">droider.ru</a> , <a href="http://4android.ru/htcquest/2010/12/10/htc-quest-vidzhet.html">4android.ru</a> and <a href="http://www.droidnews.ru/htc-quest-zhdet-vas-registraciya">droidnews.ru</a> . <br><br><img src="http://img718.imageshack.us/img718/4864/htcjt.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  With his help, the participants: <br><ul><li>  Were registered in the adventure; </li><li>  Took the job; </li><li>  Tracked rating. </li></ul>  All tasks and answers can be found <a href="http://blog.mobiquest.ru/%3Fp%3D158">here</a> . <br><br>  We also wrote a small reminder widget: <br><br><img src="http://img10.imageshack.us/img10/8094/083d15c75b0d02bf3c80c78.png" alt="image"><br><br><h5>  The final </h5><br>  In the final there was one task.  It included the top 20 participants on the results of the preliminary stage.  Regardless of the number of points that the finalists scored at the preliminary stage, the final adventure all started from scratch, i.e.  were on an equal footing. <br><br><img src="http://img707.imageshack.us/img707/3407/33494228.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  You can read about it and see the photo <a href="http://blog.mobiquest.ru/%3Fp%3D144">here</a> . <br><br><h5>  Total </h5><br>  The main thing is that, despite some incidents at some stages, everyone enjoyed the adventure.  On blogs and after the quest about him there were only positive reviews. <br><br>  It is equally important that we were able to test the technology.  Everything works: it means that the tasks are taken, are being passed, and automatic statistics are kept on them.  And all this is displayed both on our website and in widgets that can be installed anywhere. <br> <a href="http://mobiquest.ru/"><img src="http://img28.imageshack.us/img28/1401/27360163.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  Say <b>no to the</b> routine!
