Smart watches, trackers, heart rate monitors and, of course, scales help a person understand the state of the body during exercise, sleep, normal walking. <br><br>  As for smart scales, so far the models of such devices are just a few.  Among them is QardioBase's Qardio model.  The device was first introduced in January 2015 at CES, the shipment began in the autumn of the same year.  We, Madrobots, were among the first to get these scales, and we had a good opportunity to try them out.  The test results are in this article. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  We will list the main functions at once, and then we will evaluate the design, capabilities, application and everything else.  So, QardioBase, in addition to weight, measures body mass index (BMI) and a complete set of indicators that determine the composition of the human body.  This is the percentage of adipose tissue, muscle and bone mass, water balance.  There is even a mode of operation for pregnant women - but let's talk about this a little later.  Well, now - the details.

    <h3>  QardioBase: Design </h3><br>  At first glance, QardioBase - scales with excellent design.  After a detailed acquaintance with the device, this opinion is confirmed.  Scales will look harmonious in almost any room with any design - even in the hall, even in the bathroom.  Their body is a circle covered with tempered glass.  Below it is an LED display that shows the measurement results.  The display in standby mode is invisible, the image appears only during the measurement. <br><br>  QardioBase is smaller and lighter than standard weights.  If you flip the device, we will see a plastic base.  There is a slot where batteries are inserted (8 AAA batteries).  Why so much?  The fact is that for the operation of the device you need only 4 batteries.  The developers decided to use an interesting scheme: when the first battery module (4 pieces) sits down, the second one starts working.  At this time, you can replace the batteries in the first module without the threat of losing data and resetting settings, as is the case with some other smart scales.  Eight batteries will last for about a year of use, after which you can replace or recharge them if you use batteries. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4f1/803/d0e/4f1803d0ea219429554c8bfde9bbc800.jpg"><br><br>  The accuracy of the measurement is quite high - the discrepancy for measurements taken in a row is no more than several tens of grams. <br><br><h3>  QardioBase: Device Features </h3><br>  Functions in these scales quite a lot.  And here the important role played by the presence of the display.  For example, when you step on the scales, they show a smiling smiley - a trifle, but nice.  Smileys developers decided to use as a simple motivating feedback.  If there is progress, a positive smiley is shown.  There is no progress - the emoticon is neutral.  Well, if the user moves in the opposite direction from the set goal, then the scale gets upset, showing a sad smiley face.  All this makes the device closer to the person. <br><br>  As mentioned above, QardioBase is ‚Äúsmart‚Äù scales.  This means, in particular, that they transfer all data to the proprietary application.  If the house has a Wi-Fi network, the device will transmit all data wirelessly to the ‚Äúcloud‚Äù.  And already the application on the mobile device will receive data from the cloud.  That is, when weighing up, there is no need to keep a mobile device nearby, sending measurement data is in automatic mode.  If there is no Wi-Fi network, then data can be sent to the application directly via Bluetooth Smart.  You can learn that the measurement was made and saved in the app thanks to a soft vibration. <br><br>  Measurements of adipose, bone and muscle tissue are carried out due to the presence of bio-impedance sensor, which, by measuring the electrical conductivity of the body, allows you to understand the percentage ratio of various tissues and water in the body.  For measurements of this type, the scales need to be in contact with human skin, so it‚Äôs impossible to weigh in socks. <br><br>  The bioimpedance sensor can be turned off - this is necessary if the scale is used by people with implanted pacemakers and defibrillators. <br><br>  As for the regime for future mothers, when it is turned on, the user begins to track the progress in the development of the fetus.  The developers made it possible to add their own photo or even ultrasound results to each measurement in the application so that you can then recall each step along the way.  Of course, if there is no desire, then photos can and not be attached - there is no problem. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7fe/91f/e32/7fe91fe32dd3bc13ddc8331d261a40f7.jpg"><br><br>  There is also support for multiple profiles.  So that the scales can be used by the whole family.  If there is a risk of incorrect operation (in case the weight of users weighing in is similar), then the scale displays a list of available profiles.  You can switch options by gently pressing your foot on the surface of the balance.  The results of the measurement can be shared with friends or send information to your doctor. <br><br><h3>  QardioBase: characteristics </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/718/04d/6b3/71804d6b3d404d4fa638575221997742.png"><br><br><h3>  QardioBase: application </h3><br>  Setting up the scales using the application is a fairly simple process.  First, of course, you need to download the application, it is called the Qardio app.  Then the user needs to create an account, turn on the scales, stand on them and follow the instructions.  The device is equipped with a Wi-Fi module, so that data is wirelessly transmitted all the time to the cloud with which the application is synchronized.  There is also a Bluetooth module in case there is no access to the network, giving the opportunity to synchronize data directly. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b55/a9e/48e/b55a9e48e2dbf13190c109fc3932b7eb.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The measurement results are displayed on the scale display, as mentioned above, and in the appendix.  The program shows the results of both recent measurements and a measurement log for a long time.  By the way, the user can set goals in the application ‚Äî for example, lose weight to a certain parameter or build muscle. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ba6/509/07e/ba650907e1b9261d30396030f11ad3ee.jpg"><br><br>  The application interface is intuitive, you can work with the program without problems.  There are various sections where you can see the processed measurement results in the form of graphs or tables. <br><br>  Scales remind of the need for regular weighing with the help of the same application.  After all, if you do not follow the dynamics of weight, then why take measurements at all? <br><br>  The application can be customized by removing some elements of the measurements (for example, the same body mass index) if necessary.  Measurement results can be sent to Apple Health - the scales are compatible with this software platform. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/684/749/ab3/684749ab3e14c3125a1cca1c11b76550.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  If the user has a QardioArm tonometer (we are already preparing a review of the device), then the measurement results made with the help of this device will also be displayed in the application.  And you can see the connection between its own weight and blood pressure. <br><br><h3>  In the dry residue </h3><br>  QardioBase - minimalistic smart scales with a thoughtful set of functions and an excellent application.  With their help, you can easily monitor the dynamics of changes in its own weight or other parameters of the body.  The possibility of supplementing these readings with measurements of the QardioArm tonometer is another plus in favor of working with weights. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GWUpENTrFtE" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <b>Pros:</b> <br><br><ul><li>  Great design; </li><li>  Simple and effective application; </li><li>  Easy and simple setup; </li><li>  Support for multiple user profiles; </li><li>  Integration with Apple Health; </li><li>  Accuracy of measurements. </li></ul><br>  <b>Minuses:</b> <br><br><ul><li>  Requires immediately 8 AAA batteries. </li></ul><br><h3>  QardioBase: where to buy? </h3><br>  You can buy QardioBase in Russia in <a href="http://madrobots.ru/p/qardiobase/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dqardiobase_obzor">our store</a> . <br><br> <a href="http://madrobots.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dqardiobase_obzor"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d29/4c3/07d/d294c307dde04335ac3f425e73b36a7a.gif"></a> <br> <a href="http://madrobots.ru/about/mails/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dqardiobase_obzor"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7fa/417/fe3/7fa417fe3d464fa5aa186b1ab30da53a.gif"></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/400241/">https://habr.com/ru/post/400241/</a></p>
