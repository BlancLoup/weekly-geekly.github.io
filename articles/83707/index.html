Since there have been no reviews of this notebook on Habr√©, and the model is interesting, I assume that it will be interesting for readers to read the commentary about the lengthy review (2 months - I consider the period for which you can judge about the long work in the future and the opinion about one or another component of the product, based not on the first impression) from me as a user programmer using this laptop in everyday work / studies.  So let's get started. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  General information about the model and the reasons why I chose it. </h4><br>  This notebook is part of the UnLimited Series from Asus, that is, it offers light and thin long-lived laptops, built on the basis of ULV (Ultra Low Voltage) series processors, which allow for a sufficiently productive processor (this series includes processors celeron, pentium, core 2 solo / duo frequencies from 1.2 to 1.6 GHz, with different cache options.TDP ranges from 10W, which is quite a bit, you will agree) to have a long operating time.  The downside of such processors is a reduced frequency, but even on it they remain Intel Centrino processors, which completely tears them away from Atoms and allows them to work comfortably. <br><br>  I chose a laptop to replace my old Acer Aspire 5561, which was built on the basis of the Core Duo 1.6, gave out more than enough performance for my tasks, but both the running time (3 hours) and the dimensions / weight (14 "/2.3 kg) were for I was unacceptable - I had to work from 5 hours, and at the same time I had less weight (I was carrying myself in my backpack all day. With sizes it was simpler - 14 "was too big, but the principle" the less the better "was not for me - I looked at 11 "models - you will kill the eyes from the small screen, we did not want to. Something between 12 and 13" was chosen, while 12 or 13 - it was  unprincipled, both comfortably fit in a backpack, and other required parameters of the device played a large role - first of all, work time. <br><br>  Also, the laptop was required to have a minimum of wifi / BT / cardreader / 3USB.  VGA / HDMI were welcomed - at home and 24 "monik TV, I wanted to get rid of them. CD / DVD-RW - was unprincipled. Price - well, the moral threshold was 30 thousand, which eliminated certainly good models from Sony, MacBook Pro, Asus U20, ThinkPad x200 (s).

      Total - everything was chosen between the models on ULV (Atom I didn‚Äôt fit in principle - Photoshop and Visual Studio were in the main programs that were worth running) from Acer, HP, ASUS, Lenovo.  I have to say right away, from the previous experience of quality - Acer was scored right away, HP did not like the trite, the choice was between Lenovo U330, Asus UL20, Asus UL30.  Then he actually searched through the topics, forums, ‚Äúplayed‚Äù with the laptops in the store trying to figure out which is more convenient.  By that time, I decided that I want a laptop on Core 2 Duo (SU7300 if we are talking about a specific model), because only there, first, 2 cores and uncut cache, and secondly, virtualization technology, which allows running virtual machines and XP Mode on Win7 . <br><br>  UL20 "fell off" when I realized that they do not come with more than 6-cell battery, there is no HDMI in it, and the operating time for UL30 is higher, besides, the keyboard is trimmed to pbup / down / home and etc. eat right.  Lenovo "fell off" because of the best reviews on the forums and, again, the battery and operating time.  So, the choice was made in favor of the UL30, and I began to look for a model with an extended battery (8 bars, 5600 MAh) and SU7300.  I will make a reservation right away, the UL30 comes in 2 body colors - gray and black, black is more marking, gray is better.  I wanted gray, but the SU7300 + gray in the Russian Federation did not seem to have been delivered so far (and even more so it wasn‚Äôt delivered in December, then the SU7300 UL30 was just hard to find on sale), so as soon as I found black that meets my requirements, I took it without thinking ( by the way, paid a little more than 27k wooden) <br><br><h4>  Main characteristics </h4><br><img src="http://torg-pc.ru/products_pictures/UL30A.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="http://bluetooth.com.ua/image/b/1833_3/ASUS%20UL30A%20(UL30A-SU230NFGFAW).jpg" alt="image"><br><ol><li>  Screen: 13.3 ", 1376 * 768, <b>glossy</b> </li><li>  Processor (in this configuration): Core 2 Duo ULV SU7300, 1.3Ghz </li><li>  Video: Built-in Intel 4500MHD </li><li>  Memory: 4 GB DRR3 </li><li>  Winch: 5400rpm, 2.5 ", 320Gb </li><li>  WiFi (b / g) + WiMax (Intel 5150 AGX), Gigabit Lan (Atheros), BT, 3 * Usb, VGA, HDMI </li><li>  The keyboard is full-sized (all buttons are present, only the top row is trimmed in height), sony / mac style - low profile, dividers between keys </li></ol><br>  What was expected, what is not: <br><ul><li>  In the American version, 802.11n is implemented, though there is no WiMax.  I hoped that 5150 will be with N wifa, but it is not there.  True, judging by the conversations of the specialists of the 5150 card with N and without, differ in EPrm, so it is possible to fix the case with an EPROM interchange </li><li>  Backlight Claudia.  Alas, it‚Äôs only in U20 and above (the U and UL series are very different, both in functionality and in price).  In this model, there is also no light sensor and, accordingly, adjusting the brightness of the screen for lighting.  Apparently, the marketing ploy. </li><li>  It was expected that the aluminum cover would not be the mark (metal is still ...), but ASUS invented aluminum, with which I congratulate her.  Alas, for me it was a minus, as well as glossy plastic throughout the body. </li><li>  no PCMCIA / ExpressCard </li></ul><br>  Now let's go to everything in order <br><br><h4>  Housing </h4><br>  The case did not creak, it was not particularly bent.  Metal cover looks durable.  The hinges of the screen are hard, allow you to open and stay at any angle (the opening angle is about 130 degrees).  Magnetic refinement, as well as snaps, no.  4 diodes (3 blue activities + red-green power) are on the end, they are not very bright and therefore do not distract the eyes and do not interfere, and when you need to - they are clearly visible. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f90/563/9b5/f905639b500a89db7773c6503194e79d.jpg" alt="image"><br>  On the right - 2 * usb, card reader (for sd-cards, did not try cards of other formats), power connector, microphone input and headphone output. <br>  Front - only indicators. <br>  On the left - HDMI, VGA, 1 * USB, vent hole.  Behind - is empty, there is a battery. <br><br><h4>  Power / Battery </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/693/a2f/c1f/693a2fc1fd1d99ce434e395f42424f45.jpg" alt="image"><br>  The power supply to the laptop is small, akin to netbook.  The result - in the bag quickly throws.  But it takes a long time - it takes me about 3 hours to fully charge. <br><br><img src="http://www.minilaptops.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/ASUS-UL30A-mini-laptop-computers-a.jpg" alt="image"><br>  The laptop was taken with a battery of 8 cells, 5600 mAh.  The battery and its shape (reading that it is extended) is perfectly calculated - there is a protrusion, but the ergonomics do not suffer, the battery slightly raises the laptop in the rear part (and the tilt of the keyboard is more convenient), does not interfere with transfer.  In general - lepotta. <br><br>  Battery life ... Well, I said - GOOD FELLOWS!  On my settings (WiFi / WiMAx, applications like Visual Studio, the screen is about 40% brightness), it keeps about 8 hours (sometimes a little more sometimes a little less strongly depends on what you do, but in general this way).  Without Wi-Fi - according to, you can think about the most cherished 12 hours about which is written with the purchase.  In general, the time autonomous as happy as an elephant.  When the game lasted, the note (considering the Intel 4500MHD video card) was slightly more than 4.5 hours ... I think it will pull 5-6 hours on films, I did not specifically test, I do not know. <br><br><h4>  Screen </h4><br><img src="http://www.abcom.ru/data/other/4072/Main_1_400x367_90.jpg" alt="image"><br>  By the size I arranged it - the most for a mobile device.  You can't kill your eyes about a trifle, however, the size also allows it to be ‚Äúmobile‚Äù.  The resolution of 1376 * 768 allows you to watch 720p without downscale, which is good for me.  The screen has a ratio of 16: 9, that is, a widescreen in the full sense of the word.  I got used to 4: 3/16: 10 (at home was 17 ", at work 19" 4: 3, another 24 "16:10). I had to get used to it a little, but I got used to it. <br><br>  The brightness is sufficient, even more than.  Viewing angles - horizontal are good.  With vertical - as always in TN, do not expect a miracle, a deviation from the vertical leads to a change in the image.  But it is now in all the laptops, except for the premium class.  Gloss - interferes, like any gloss.  But I got used to it even on the past laptop and I do not notice.  Brightness to kill him for me - enough. <br><br>  By silence (for me), the fonts for such a screen at this resolution are too small - so I increased them in Windows.  Now I am happy. <br><br>  <b>Summary:</b> In general - the usual glossy screen with decent brightness. <br><br><h4>  Keyboard and touchpad </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/09c/671/43a/09c67143a0cb414425ff341ccacb8681.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e62/687/a7c/e62687a7cd117ae30b2a5627c95d2c85.jpg" alt="image"><br>  I liked the keyboard.  Full-sized keys.  All buttons on the usual places.  Only the top row with F1 ... F12 is trimmed in height, the rest are square.  The keys are separated and have a small move, like on sony and macbook of the latter.  I like it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6fb/bc9/511/6fbbc95116014a9a1dabd495d08109da.jpg" alt="image"><br>  The touchpad is not recessed, highlighted on the surface by recessed pimples of a millimeter radius of 2 with 5 millimeters between them.  The touchpad is capacitive, supports multitouch in the wood (scrolling with 2 fingers vertical / horizontal + pressing 2 and 3 fingers of the middle and right buttons, dragging with 2 fingers. In general, normal multitouch).  Apart from the marcos, I like everything. <br><br><h4>  Network </h4><br>  LAN - just works.  Gigabit was nowhere to protest, speed I will not say.  Wi-Fi is really only 802.11g, n apparently will require some work on the file.  It catches well, holds too.  Yota - works.  The average level of reception is a bit (within the error) better than a whistle.  Sinezub - just works. <br><br><h4>  Sound </h4><br>  The card is naturally embedded.  And through the headphones - mediocre.  BUT (!) The inscription on the Atec Lansing speakers is really true for a long time I have not heard so much good sound from the laptop beeper.  The stereo is audible, there are even some hints of bass (and there is no saba).  In general, the columns are built in as needed and as needed. <br><br><h4>  Other iron </h4><br>  The card reader is convenient, spring-loaded with a plug (although it is easy to lose it).  USB - no complaints.  CD / DVDRW - no as a class.  I bought LiteOn eSau 208 software for myself - I‚Äôm working on reading quietly like a clock from a single Usb, and I don‚Äôt need more from it. <br><br><img src="http://ru.asus.com/websites/Global/products/8CwAK6XZ0pekc7aI/wI7r77FGnbGStFHa_500.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Camera is bad.  Frankly no.  Like the built-in microphone.  put to tick "to be."  So keep in mind. <br><br><h4>  System and software </h4><br>  With the laptop went Windows 7 Home Basic (plin, why did you translate? Home Basic and that's it).  I expanded to Professional via Windows Anytime Upgrade - I wanted a full-fledged Aero (yes, yes, I know ryushechka), but I needed XP Mode to work - and only in Pro and above. <br>  <s>Garbage</s> Software is set by default a lot, but there is little useful.  pleased Asus DVD is a rebrand of PowerDVD.  In the relevance of the player without a DVD on the laptop I do not see, but the thing is useful in itself - movies with usb dvdrw, rips are not recommended to watch.  Corporate software for setting up power saving modes is also not bad.  The rest is basically done - I do not need it. <br><br><h4>  experience </h4><br><br>  Compounded here, you first need to determine why I needed a laptop.  At home I have a machine with a large screen, Q9450 / GTX260 - so the laptop was not bought for games.  At work - a working comp + test macbook pro - so it doesn‚Äôt work. <br>  I needed a laptop for study (the second higher education - you need to count something on pairs in a <s>web</s> browser).  Couples sometimes go for 5 hours, outlets mute.  In some classrooms there was no wifi with an Internet - so the iota was useful.  In addition - mobility in travel trips on business trips, and so on.  That is, to watch the film, to guide, after the photo session of the Ravki to process it, it was also necessary.  Atom was missing. <br><br>  UL30 pleased me with light weight (with an extended battery of about 1.8kg), compact size - I threw it into my backpack and forgot.  And most of all - the work time - there was enough battery for all my manipulations.  For 5+ hours of lectures, I never planted a battery below 40% - only later at home. <br><br>  The keyboard is comfortable - the coding went light, and I finish off the article on the note :) Silent almost - if in a quiet room you can sometimes hear a slight noise of the ventilation system.  Vinch sometimes crackles, but not for long, but it is immediately obvious that some difficult process is taking place ... I am thinking about how to install an SSD for greater silence like in a large computer.  Although the laptop is so quiet. <br><br>  The screen for watching solo movies is enough for me, as well as the sound path.  You can listen to music, but zvukovuha does not compare with Revolution 5.1 - day and night.  But not those old tweeters of the market.  Listen without tears - you can. <br><br>  Productivity on Photoshop, Studio and TP - enough.  4 gigabytes of memory with x64 Windows - enough, even for heavy applications and games. <br><br>  Games - a separate conversation - played in LineAge, PerfectWorld, Quake, CS on it - draws.  The first two are in medium settings and if there is no huge crowd on the screen.  WoW do not play - xs.  Although I can say - for modern gaming interfaces, the screen is too small (or I have a habit of 1920 * 1200 already resistant). <br><br>  For 2 months on the edges of the lid from the inner side a little plastic began to rub off.  It can be seen so far only with strong side lighting.  Naturally, the functionality does not affect, and I don't care about beauty - the main thing is that everything is comfortable and work.  He decided to fight dullness with the purchase of matte film - this is a matter for the future, as is the fight against the missing 802.11n. <br><br><h4>  findings </h4><br>  As you already understood - I like the laptop.  Even more.  For my tasks - a mobile device for tasks that the atom cannot cope with and has long battery life - copes with a bang.  A full set of wireless interfaces makes it possible to use the Internet wherever you want (well, except that if you still had a built-in 3g - it would be awesome at all). <br><br>  The keyboard turned out (in spite of some angry reviews on the forums) - convenient, both for ICQ and for <s>Habratopikov</s> coding. <br><br>  What upset - the glossy laptop completely (then when the gray ones are delivered are the same - it will be better, the gray is less brand), you have to wipe it.  I was surprised by the know-how - aluminum brand ... I was very surprised, we will consider ASUS's know-how. <br>  No camera and microphone could either put or better (again, apparently the intrigues of marketers who put the main tick in there is a camera). <br>  The lack of Wi-Fi 802.11n - apparently there are some intrigues already associated with the legitimacy of WiFi N - I don‚Äôt really know why a separate 5150 modification for Russia was made that does not support it and differs only in firmware. <br><br>  In general - a very positive long-lived laptop for mobile use. <br><br>  PS All images were found in Google and addresses are inserted here.  I tried to take from different resources to avoid the harbraeffect. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/83707/">https://habr.com/ru/post/83707/</a></p>
