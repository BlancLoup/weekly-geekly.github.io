Along the way, held a competition in Habr√©. <br><br>  To win the competition, it was necessary to guess where the ball with the server would land.  The prize was the participation in the Mediterranean regatta in Greece in the same boat with the team Habra and RUVDS.  The winner of the competition could not then go to the regatta, the second prize-winner Vitaly Makarenko from Kaliningrad went instead.  We asked him a few questions about yachts, races, port girls and a bottle of rum. <br><br>  What happened read under the cut.

What was waiting for?  What pictures painted the imagination? </h4><br>  In general, from the moment of the first letter, everything seemed to be reading on the entertainment portal about the next draw.  Previously, somehow did not win any prizes, and even more so trips to the warm seas, and even with the drive.  All the time, subconsciously waited for the letter - ‚Äúsorry, due to the circumstances, everything is postponed‚Äù.  But the closer to the date, the more confidence in the upcoming event.  Already the information on the tickets, I begin to figure out what to take with me ... But still, everything is postponed until the last day, and judging by the correspondence in the chat, everyone has done so.  A couple of hours before departure, someone wrote a list of what needs to be taken.  I quickly ran through it - it is, it is not ... a sleeping bag - I hope you don‚Äôt need it anyway, warm clothes - it seems like the forecast is no lower than +10, which means we are fitting.  sun cream ... no - fast shopping, anyway, no.  in the solarium - there is a tick.  all in a backpack, car, airport and here it is - the beginning of the journey. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8da/0f3/c4d/8da0f3c4dbb77c9da5f44d75ec701cc2.jpg"><br><br>  In general, I really like this moment - the very beginning, when I came out to the threshold, went out of town or at the airport, and everything is ahead.  What will be for sure is still unknown, but you always hope that this time there will be interesting places and people ... But before traveling either by car or by plane, and then a week on the yacht was coming.  Before that, it was only on pleasure yachts, for several hours, so you will not make any impressions.  And then - the complete unknown.  What kind of beast is this yacht?  Big?  How many people are there at all?  What will have to do?  Where to live / eat / sleep?  Will it rock?  We will climb the guys like in the books about pirates and will not the captain send a stroll along the board for the unfulfilled instructions?  In a word, some questions and the desire to try it all. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6bc/95d/ecd/6bc95decd34ba2bfef3a0352a8b0e81b.jpg"><br><br><h4>  First day at sea.  Is everything as expected? </h4><br>  Since we arrived at the yacht late at night, I didn‚Äôt really see anything.  Well, the ship is in the dark, even the dimensions are not clearly understood.  In the evening, we just had a little walk, a snack and go to bed.  The morning started off leisurely - had breakfast, a light instruction from Captain Andrey - this saved the vests, this is the strapping, do not jump overboard, do everything according to the instructions.  Well, I think this is for a start, then they will tell you what and how to do.  But then the captain Vladimir appears on the yacht, a quick acquaintance and wrap everything up ... Well, yes, the captains are commanding the yacht, the Greeks are shouting something from the coastal attendants of the marina.  So training began immediately in battle.  They took moorings, left the marina, removed the fenders, and began to set sail.  I still do not know - the fact that on such yachts you don‚Äôt have to climb the masts, it pleased or upset.  Reading about the pirates, looking at some "Kruzenshtern" involuntarily remember about all this rigging.  And then there are literally four winches, a piano and a steering wheel.  If there is a great need, one person can cope with the whole economy, but of course it is optimally 4. In general, by the middle of the day we could well have hunted and stuffed, kept to the wind and slowly knit a couple of knots.  And after you stand at the helm ... You begin to feel like a kind of sea wolf.  But God forbid her to gape and the sail will slam, then you and the captain will shout from the sky into the water.  For the whole day everyone managed to get their dose of knowledge, eat their first sea dinner and get salty sprays in the face.  We managed to drive with arrogant gulls and cut the steam and stand in traffic in the queue at the parking lot.  So in the evening, Captain Vladimir transferred everyone from the jung to the sailors, which was noted at some coastal restaurant. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/696/66f/5d9/69666f5d93c07e2853fa7d2ca5362ae3.jpg"><br><br><h4>  In the cinema, all the yachts are filled with chillout atmosphere, cocktails and bikini girls.  You had a complete set, right? </h4><br>  Oh yes, there were hopes that the yacht will be equipped with all of the above.  Reality, as usual, was harsher.  And if our DJ Pavel did a wonderful job of maintaining some chillout atmosphere and creating cocktails, as well as some exotic dishes, the girls on board were not observed, only our male team.  The girls could be seen on neighboring yachts, although there was no bikini, but the rescue of the vests were present. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f60/2b3/21e/f602b321e3fe02b4a9f12f12f49ed791.jpg"><br><br><h4>  How many were you on the team?  What were your responsibilities?  Was it all fixed?  If not, how did you find yourself? </h4><br>  In general, we had - two captains, three sailors and a secret weapon in the form of a DJ.  Hard duty in principle, no one was.  Everyone could do, and did, everything.  The question is just what turned out better and what is worse.  Before the trip, I thought there would be a problem - how to take a whole day.  In reality, time flies by, things are themselves.  The yacht does not stand still - someone must follow the course, instruments, the environment and the wind.  The wind has changed, is it time to change the course because you have come to a point, or just someone needs to go around?  One at the wheel, one at the instruments, two at the winches and one at the piano.  From time to time, everything changed places, so that everyone was in all roles. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7c8/4ba/0ab/7c84ba0ab652b9c4fa1bd402be9b1923.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Tell me about your captain.  One eye?  Wooden leg?  Was it filled with rum?  What are the stories baited? </h4><br>  In general, I am from a port city, and I have been to work in military courts and fishing vessels, so I have seen many and different seamen.  Our captain, despite the absence of external signs (a wooden leg, a bandage on the eye and a parrot on his shoulder) in terms of experience, would give a head start to John Silver himself.  Suppose that in the first days we only had the opportunity to listen to commands, instructions and various ‚Äúanchoring you in the liver!‚Äù, In the following days the captain showed that he easily copes not only with the storm and mooring in difficult conditions, but also with local rum, having come out of all the adventures the winner.  And one day, when the race was canceled due to calm, we not only swam in the warm sea, but also heard the captain's stories, in which there were enough adventures, shootings, and sea crossings.  By the way about the treasure, a barrel of rum and a chest with the dead, it was also there. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a41/413/dbb/a41413dbb89126ab2f326b429bfc47bb.jpg"><br><br><h4>  How to cope with the race?  It was difficult to?  I wanted to feed someone to the fish? </h4><br>  Personally, it seems to me that for the new team, where everyone except the captain first went up to the deck, we did it perfectly well.  Of course there were problems, but everyone tried and did everything he could, did not back down and did not give up.  In the beginning, of course, it was difficult, but by the middle of the race of especially gross mistakes no one made, so if anyone wanted to feed fish, it was rivals who were able to get around at the next stage. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f86/d4a/726/f86d4a72669c26b658adfe415cb80374.jpg"><br><br><h4>  The biggest achievement and the most fierce command team? </h4><br>  The main achievement - we could.  No one gave up, did not leave the deck, everyone fought to the end.  There was no emergency, no one was hurt, the boat did not receive any damage.  On one of the days, there were as many as 4 collisions between yachts, and in fact, under the terms of the competition, such a yacht was immediately withdrawn from participation in races.  So I think the biggest achievement is not the second place in the difficult stage with the night passage between the islands, but well-coordinated work, where everyone almost without words understands what is required of him.  Therefore, I can not say that there were any "fierce feil."  Everyone had mistakes, nature prevented somewhere, circumstances somewhere, but on the whole we won. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1db/b63/b7a/1dbb63b7ad752d53e49ee9e2ed16fd63.jpg"><br><br><h4>  How tough is the race itself?  Does a personal drone monitor every boat?  Do you have time for the port ... girls? </h4><br>  In general, the race is positioned as ‚Äúfor beginner skippers‚Äù, but still more for those who are not the first time to go to sea.  This is evident by the way the tasks for the day are given and by the tasks themselves.  We, the newcomers, never managed to meet the specified "four hours along the route."  By the way, the task is monitored by a special tracker program.  We moored in the marina is always dark, and the exit to the sea is usually after 9 o'clock, so we spent 12 hours on the deck every day.  In spite of such loads, upon arrival at the port, the forces for a survey of the new island always remained, although usually in the first stage there was always a visit to some restaurant or cafe to recover strength.  Well, the Nike Borzov concert organized by the organizers was visited by everyone with great desire and joy. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/774/32a/932/77432a932458eb5c9ae55e7bf433427b.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Compare your condition when you first sailed from the port and when you returned to it.  Feel like a sea wolf?  What did you learn? </h4><br>  Is there a difference before and after?  I think yes.  Maybe not a sea wolf, but completely endured all the tests, pulled the sheets and halyards along with everyone, twisted the winches and stood at the helm, scraped the mast in the wind calls and tied knots on the fenders. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/549/049/ed3/549049ed3e6196f5cb92a600a298988a.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Do you dream of sea knots, sailor?  Do sweet rock sirens sing?  Would you like to repeat?  Ready to increase the difficulty? </h4><br>  Oh, the knots may not even dream, but the first days the earth swayed noticeably underfoot.  I wanted again from this gray rain under a blue sky, a bright sun and sparkling waves.  It was even learned about the local yacht club.  But, although the city and the port, and even pass periodically regattas, they all seem to be made by the forces of enthusiasts, but it is impossible to get official training, to get a crust, to become yourself at the helm.  I think in the summer to talk with local yachtsmen, to find out who among them was going this way.  Still, the time spent sailing is just not forgotten. <br><br><h4>  <font color="#78a2b7">PS</font> </h4><br>  Friends, on April 12 we will launch the server into the stratosphere.  As in the past year, we will hold a <a href="https://12.ruvds.com/">contest</a> in which we must guess where the probe with the server on board lands.  The main prize will be a trip to Baikonur, to launch a manned spacecraft Soyuz-TM-13. <br><br> <a href="https://12.ruvds.com/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c03/2f5/1f7/c032f51f7d585279366ea59fd2f0eae2.jpg"></a> <br><br> <a href="https://ruvds.com/ru-rub/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1ba/550/d25/1ba550d25e8846ce8805de564da6aa63.png"></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/446782/">https://habr.com/ru/post/446782/</a></p>
