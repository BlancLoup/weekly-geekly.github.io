Approximately 90% of all conversations about dismissal begin in this way.  And whoever starts the conversation first, the result is usually predictable.  What if the right person leaves you?  Under the cut is the <i>opinion</i> <i>of Parallels Vice President</i> <b>Nikolai Dobrovolsky</b> . <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  I usually interview all the employees who come to our company.  Given that there are only about 300 people around the world, the departure of any of the ‚Äú300 Spartans‚Äù causes a certain inner excitement.  We have been working with some colleagues for about twenty years.  Over the years, certain thoughts have been accumulated as to what to do if a person, invaluable to a crew, suddenly decided to leave the ship ashore.

I strongly disagree with this.  Dismissal is stressful.  By his will, a person, if everything is in order with him, is unlikely to consciously want to leave the comfort zone.  Probably there are reasons that pushed him to this.  Learn about them.  Try to help.  Experience suggests that there are practically no insoluble situations.  If a person is really valuable for the team, it is worth stepping on the throat of pride and try to keep it.  Moreover, it is not always about money.  Elementary switching to new tasks may affect the earlier decision.  Probably the question arises, what about the former duties of an employee?  Who will do his work?  Believe me, this is less critical.  If a valuable specialist leaves you, you will still have to somehow distribute his tasks and, most likely, sooner or later, look for a replacement for him.  It is important to understand that a valuable professional is a keeper of knowledge, culture, traditions, authority and a leader of opinions.  It's like losing a finger on a hand or leg, you can live, but the functionality is reduced. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/2da/18d/3cd/2da18d3cd9a64eff9e221e0ef66ef720.png"><br><br><h3>  <font color="#cc0000">Talk</font> </h3><br>  What do people regret on their deathbed?  Judging by the stories of those who were on the verge of life and death, unfulfilled work commitments are somewhere far at the end of the list.  Most people complained about the lack of time to communicate with family and friends.  Basically, being laid off is a little death.  Of course, thank God, everyone remains alive and healthy, but the steady link breaks.  A person goes out of orbit, you stop communicating.  In your power to avoid this.  Talk to people.  You will be surprised how often the lack of a positive assessment of the work by the direct manager appears as a reason for dismissal.  People want to be needed and to feel their importance.  For example, in large companies, such as Intel, managers have a duty to spend at least an hour a month with each of their direct subordinates on non-work related topics.  It is believed that this way you can feel the mood of your employee regarding his position in the company.  By the way, in many ways, this differs domestic management from American, for example.  What happens to the employee who made a working mistake in Russia?  A hard reaction from the authorities, ‚Äúcarpet‚Äù, ‚Äúhead wash‚Äù, ‚Äúsoaped neck‚Äù, ax and rope to boot.  In the West, everything looks different.  The stumbled employee is thanked for the work, provides all kinds of moral support, and instructs on further labor exploits.  The management understands that the business has already paid the expensive price for training this particular specialist due to the mistake made and it will be foolish to say goodbye to him right now.  Most likely the experience gained will allow the company to avoid similar failures in the future. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/65d/d51/0ac/65dd510ac195467d81868e90cc9042cc.png"><br><br><h3>  <font color="#cc0000">Wait back</font> </h3><br>  Imagine that your efforts were without result.  The man leaves.  My persistent belief, no matter what happens, must always be parted in an amicable way.  Do not burn bridges.  In addition, oddly enough, the dismissal is far from the end of your collaboration.  First, it is worth getting the maximum feedback from the outgoing specialist.  What did you like about work?  What didn't you like?  What would he change?  Who does he see in his place and why?  A person has nothing to lose and he is ready in this situation to share his experience and knowledge.  Do not neglect this information.  Think of those who stayed with you.  It is necessary to carefully consider the redefinition of areas of responsibility between team members.  Probably the load will increase.  Need to prepare people.  We at Parallels value our team and strive to maintain a healthy atmosphere in the team. <br><br>  Not once met the opinion that once gone back to the company can not be taken.  This is nonsense, myth and stupidity.  Recall Steve Jobs, with the scandal dismissed from his own company and triumphantly returned after a few years.  Those who are waiting are returned.  I will say more, not only wait for the departed back, but also prepare the ground for this.  For example, people went to me to other companies, to positions above, for a big salary, but many of those whom I sincerely offered to return came back.  Even on the same conditions with which they left.  I am familiar with cases when specialists in large IT corporations left and returned several times.  If a truly valuable employee leaves the company, you must assure him that you will always be happy to resume cooperation.  It is important to understand that often leaving a brilliant specialist is a consequence of your carelessness. <br><br>  In general, if you sum up, then keep talented people.  Sometimes through overcoming their own pride, through communication, respect and support.  Be wiser.  Try to make the life of employees comfortable and happy.  After all, a programmer is a kind of artist.  A happy person is able to create and create masterpieces. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/334056/">https://habr.com/ru/post/334056/</a></p>
