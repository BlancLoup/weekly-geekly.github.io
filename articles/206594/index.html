Last time I promised to tell you about the unusual base stations (to reduce the BS), which is in the Cheboksary branch of Beeline.  We collected these facts for the 11th anniversary of Beeline in Chuvashia, it was a very interesting selection. <br><br><h4>  Pink BS </h4><br>  The first story is about the station in Novocheboksarsk, which is located at the Palace of Sports.  There is installed standard equipment, but the station itself is painted pink.  According to the project, we should paint in white, but then it so happened that the builders accidentally painted pink.  Now, every time when journalists come to us, they ask us to show this art object.  Here he is: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/198/404/afa/198404afa4c3b52e26a044bcfaf17f74.jpg" alt="image">

    <h4>  "Glushilka" </h4><br>  In the village of Alikovo in Soviet times, there was a station that interfered with short waves so that the residents of Chuvashia and neighboring regions could not listen to radio stations of foreign states.  The tower from her remained.  We dismantled unnecessary elements and used a metal support to place the antennas. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ca3/45d/ade/ca345dade972f1430e9c6994efe094eb.jpg" alt="image"><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Highest BS </h4><br>  This is a mast of the RTPC (radio and television transmission center), located under Tsivilsk, its height is 354 meters.  He worked at this station for 10 years.  Was at the highest point of this mast: the view is fantastic.  Feelings of boundlessness and flight.  The antennas themselves, of course, are not located at the highest point, lower, at around 150 meters.  Nevertheless, this base station Beeline in Chuvashia turned out to be the highest. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5f1/2b4/8e2/5f12b48e23eb4bac3b78083a5fa64dcd.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  "Savior" </h4><br>  In the forests of the Volga region in 2009 there were strong fires.  Communication there was mainly on radios, so Beeline built in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe village "Proletarian" tower, 75 meters high.  This BS provides operational coordination of foresters and firefighters, plus it just helps people in the area well.  Journalists called her "Savior." <br><br>  So that you more accurately understand how vast the expanses of the Trans-Volga forests are, here is a panorama from an airplane.  On the right, these are solid forests of the Volga region. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4bf/8f4/bfc/4bf8f4bfc3e56306806c2aa0582cf7e1.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  BS on the "Hospital complex" </h4><br>  This is a common base station, but it has a very interesting installation history.  The fact is that we try to use the resources as optimally as possible, and the staff‚Äôs keenness helps a lot in this.  In 2002, we mounted this BS on the roof of the ‚ÄúHospital complex‚Äù at an altitude of about 40 meters.  Stretching a cable there is not a trivial task.  It was possible to hire industrial climbers, but it turned out to be painfully expensive.  Then our employees decided to find out how emergency services, in general, climb on this roof - and it turned out that there is a retractable ladder at the base of the fire truck, 50 meters long.  We profitably rented it for several hours and got a very simple, and most importantly, quick installation method. <br><br><h4>  Yanzakasy </h4><br>  Here the base station itself is not interesting, but how we resolved the accident at this BS.  Quite a long time ago, in the village of Yansakasi in Tsivilsky district, the station was covered with snow.  There was so much snow that it was just unreal to get to the official car.  Normal people would have waited for an all-terrain vehicle or, at least, skis from the center, but our specialists proved once again that it is always possible to solve the problem with improvised means.  These guys collected homemade skis from plywood and ropes.  It looked incredibly funny and sloppy, but it worked.  On them they got to this base and restored the connection.  Since then, we have skis in the reserve equipment. <br><br>  There is another story with snow.  On March 8, 2004, it was necessary to launch a BS in the village of Bolshoy Sundyr.  The deadlines were tight (for base stations there are no men's or women's holidays).  Because of the mudslide, the car again could not reach the station located in the field.  Of the work remained the final setup and installation of lead batteries.  And these pieces have a mass of 50 kilograms, and they need 6 large blocks per BS.  As a result, the team put them on a homemade sled, hitched safety harnesses and dragged to the place. <br><br><h4>  BS in the forest </h4><br>  And finally, the station on the observation deck of foresters in a rather deserted area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Trans-Volga region.  In the forest are very tall pines, up to 30 meters.  Instead of the standard sector, there are installed narrowly-focused antennas, which allow to give a signal for 5-10 kilometers along the roads, even in the forest. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/935/d9d/7d2/935d9d7d24af4c7ec5e67980975bdf4a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  This, by the way, is not the only antenna of an unusual form on a BS.  There are base stations with antennas, with remote control of tilt angles: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f31/104/8f8/f311048f868c8eec11f56c291836ea93.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  But the base station in the forest on the highway, near the recreation camp "Rosinka" in the Trans-Volga region: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cfe/159/5e4/cfe1595e47b182bbab5a3138a9343b9f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Altai </h4><br>  The most interesting story was probably how we built base stations in the second year of work in Chuvashia.  The fact is that one of the employees noticed that the pillars of the Altai base stations are right in the center of the regional centers.  Altai is a Soviet mobile communications system that operated until the 1990s.  Each chairman of the state farm in the car had a radio telephone with a handset, as if from a landline telephone, and with a transceiver unit the size of a suitcase.  Accordingly, the equipment itself at the time of our arrival in Chuvashia (in 2002) was no longer in use and was dismantled.  But the supports - the pillars remained!  And in densely populated places.  The cost of support, with montage, with a land acquisition - about 2 million rubles.  We received instantly ready supports.  As a result, we were able to agree that 9 stations stood on these pillars near the buildings of district administrations.  This saved almost 18 million rubles, which we gladly used to expand the network faster. <br><br><h4>  References: </h4><br><ul><li>  My previous post about our network and <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/beeline/blog/206590/">why it is similar to formulas from organic chemistry</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/beeline/blog/128256/">BS solar powered</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/beeline/blog/178325/">BS at the diamond deposit</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/beeline/blog/192430/">Test BS</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25C0%25EB%25F2%25E0%25E9_(%25F1%25E8%25F1%25F2%25E5%25EC%25E0_%25F1%25E2%25FF%25E7%25E8)">"Altai" on Wikipedia</a> </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/206594/">https://habr.com/ru/post/206594/</a></p>
