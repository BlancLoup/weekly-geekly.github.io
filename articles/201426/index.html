The conference program is almost complete.  Speakers from Moscow, St. Petersburg, Perm will come to us, there will be many speakers from Ekaterinburg.  This year we have introduced an additional restriction for speakers and we invite only owners and co-owners of businesses.  Experience has shown that the quality of reflection in a person who risks his own money and his reputation is much higher than that of an employee. <br><br><h5>  Conference program </h5><br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>‚óè Pavel Cherkashin, investor, Moscow</b> <br>  A well-known investor in young startups who worked at Microsoft Russia and Adobe will tell instructive stories about the development of their projects.
