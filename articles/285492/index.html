  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Quiet majority of experts</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In the days when I was following the comp.lang.forth group on Usenet, I was not the only one who was unpleasantly surprised by the lack of people capable of making interesting things with Fort.  Elizabeth Rater, co-founder of Forth, Inc., offered the following explanation: there are people who are involved in real language problems, but they don‚Äôt sit in the newsgroup.  She knew for sure: her company was created to support the creation of commercial projects on Forte. <br><br>  In 1996, I worked on porting The Need for Speed ‚Äã‚Äãto Sega Saturn.  (This game console seems unusual to you to get involved with? And I was developing for 3DO and visited the Jaguar conference in the Atari head office.) Already in the 90s there were a number of well-known developers, but leading experts involved in the original version in 1994, The Need for Speed, were unknown to anyone.  And this is despite the fact that they wrote a game based on the physics of solids, before most of others learned that these words in general refer to the development of 3D video games.  And they did it without a mathematical coprocessor: the whole engine used fixed-point arithmetic. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Yes, now many people write on blogs or some other way by publicly discussing the methodology and what they are working on now, but there are still more people who do not.  Blogging takes time, and, for example, not everyone likes it.  Others are working on commercial products and cannot afford to disclose the internal workings of their own code.

      An unusual aspect of our online discussions is that we cannot learn anything from the quiet majority.  The fact that there is a certain aura of contempt around C ++, Perl, or other languages ‚Äã‚Äãdoes not mean that these languages ‚Äã‚Äãare not used by very smart guys who build stunning, beautifully executed programs.  Insanely enhanced attractive theory may have well-known, but not obvious shortcomings.  We see only the opinions of people who work on interesting things and write about them - that's all.  Most of the developers, for example, Chrome has no active profiles on Twitter, does not write to blogs, does not use Github, you can contact them only on mailing lists and bug reports, and only because Chrome is free software. <br><br>  You'd better try a lot yourself than listen to what others think. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/285492/">https://habr.com/ru/post/285492/</a></p>
