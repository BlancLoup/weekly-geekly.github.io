      <b>Current place of work:</b> <br>  Strelka Institute for Media, Architecture and Design. <br><br>  <b>One word that best describes how you work:</b> <br>  Smartly <br><br>  <b>How many hours a day do you work?</b> <br>  From 10 to 12 <br><br>  <b>Current mobile device:</b> <br>  iPhone 5c <br><br>  <b>Current computer:</b> <br>  Macbook air 11 <br><br>  <b>Without any applications, programs, utilities you can not live?</b> <br>  At work, everything is simple for me: Basecamp is our everything, Skype is the entire working correspondence is operational, Dropbox is a lot of illustrative material to be stored not only on the server, I don‚Äôt like Exel, but the order is order.  I have long installed the Facebook Eraser plugin and removed the application from my phone and I am happy, but Facebook messenger - when you need to quickly find everything and everyone, it stands.  Instagram - in addition to relaxing the brain, a unique source of links to useful projects, while you immediately understand everything about people, Alpha Click - replaces everything connected with finances.  Here to launch our new project, <a href="http://vector.education/">Vector</a> Github has mastered to the full. <br><br>  <b>Which life hack helps you save time?</b> <br>  Disconnected Facebook feed, things went faster.  I set executable tasks for the day, with experience comes an understanding of time.  Once I spotted how much time basic actions I had, it is now easy to evaluate the whole process.  And I am still writing a big task for micro actions. <br><br>  <b>What kind of to-do manager do you use?</b> <br>  A paper notebook ‚Äî there I write and draw, helps to think, and Notes as a habit.  I have not grown together with one to do manager, alas.  But I respect the basecamp very much. <br><br>  <b>What do you listen when you work?</b> <br>  My playlist VK, I'm from Petersburg. <br><br>  <b>What are you reading now?</b> <br>  The Flat White Economy, Douglas McWilliams.  Very cool, I advise everyone, alas, it is not there yet in Russian, it seems. <br><br>  <b>Which book from the last read was remembered the most?</b> <br>  I'm a fan of Scott McQuire's Media City, which was published last year in Russian by our publisher Strelka Press.  I now give her all and forever from there I cite examples, straight evangelist.  Honestly, not all our books are interesting to me, but I read this with a pencil in my hands, I had 10 ideas in the process. <br><br>  <b>Do you use e-readers or prefer paper books?</b> <br>  I read from the reading room what is not yet found on paper in Russia, but from all the trips I cite paper.  Here, from Australia, the last time was half the time: I guess this process of reading is closer to me and I‚Äôm always on design. <br><br>  <b>How long do you sleep?</b> <br>  The last time is 6 hours, but our summer program will start now and the Strelka joke: ‚ÄúI have already slept this week‚Äù will become super relevant. <br><br>  <b>Are you an owl or a lark?</b> <br>  I am a terrible owl, but in addition to work there was life and sport, I had to become a morning person. <br><br>  <b>How do you have breakfast?</b> <br>  A glass of water, buckwheat or oatmeal on the water. <br><br>  <b>How do you spend your time on the way to work / from work?</b> <br>  I love the subway - it is interesting for me to watch people, but we still work with the city.  And in the summer it is great, and this is a separate buzz along the embankment to get to Strelka. <br><br>  <b>What advice you have ever been given can you convey to others?</b> <br>  Well, like all girls in childhood, I read Gone with the Wind, so Scarlet O'Hara is always relevant: "I will not think about it today, I will think about it tomorrow."  This is for those who want everything at once.  In general, my dad always says: ‚ÄúI need to sleep with thought,‚Äù I agree with him. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/290166/">https://habr.com/ru/post/290166/</a></p>
