      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

      Leads are those users who have shown interest in our offer (product), they are our probable customers.  We know their contacts, they have already confirmed that you are interested in them - the next move is yours.  Now it depends on your actions, whether the user will buy or not.  These users are already on your doorstep, they need to be involved and brought to the purchase with maximum conversion. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/d24/56d/ee0/d2456dee0adafaac616a374fe0de522e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><br><br>  The key point to which you should pay attention is that in the CIS companies treat the Lids as a mass of users and do not personalize their work with them.  Because of this, instead of the possible 20-30% conversion from leads to customers, companies are content with 3-5%. <br><br>  The reason is simple: companies do not know anything about the Lida collected, nothing, except for their email or phone.  What kind of personalization can we talk about here?  Remember all the forms on the sites, most often they only ask for a name or email, sometimes a company name + a couple of other points. <br><br>  <strong>In fact, a form with 2 fields is already a bust</strong> , which negatively affects the conversion.  It is enough to ask only email or phone, but to know about the user is much more (or almost all).  How?  It's simple, let's look at it in detail. <br><br><br><h2>  <strong>Key lead information</strong> </h2><br>  You only need to ask the user for his email or phone (to maximize the conversion), the rest of the information can be obtained automatically using the Russian service CarrotQuest.  This information will help you to understand at what stage of the purchase the user is, what product he is interested in, how much he knows about you, where he came from and much more. <br><br>  In addition to collecting key information about your user, <a href="http://www.carrotquest.io/%3Futm_source%3Dmegam%26utm_medium%3Dcontent%26utm_campaign%3Dinformationlead"><strong>Carrot Quest</strong></a> provides a set of tools for working with leads, through which you communicate and involve them in the purchase - this is an online chat, email-mailing, pop-up windows.  All the tools are integrated with each other and this gives a special effect, but more on that later. <br><br><br><h2>  <strong>Information that Carrot Quest service can receive about your users:</strong> </h2><br><strong>&nbsp;</strong><br>  Let's start in order: <br><br>  <strong>1. Source of transition.</strong> <br><br>  Shows which channel the user came from.  So you appreciate where he learned about you and what kind of advertising came from. <br><br>  For example, from contextual advertising - it means that he himself was looking for you or your product, you just have to convince him that you have better than the competition. <br><br>  If a user comes from a PR article that does not say a word about your product, then you need to first make sure that the user is activated in your product before making an offer. <br><br><br>  <strong>2. Information about the user from his soc.</strong>  <strong>nets</strong> <br><br>  By email service is looking for public information about the user in the social.  networks.  You will learn his name, avatar, link to accounts in the social.  networks. <br><br>  It will help you to personalize communication: contact the user by name and know exactly what interests him (by viewing information about him in the social network). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/a7d/ad5/f23/a7dad5f23842d6fe1f25059b6af2429b.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <em>Screenshot of a user card when Carrot Quest</em> <br><br><br>  <strong>3. Location</strong> <br><br>  The service will show where the user is now.  For a number of businesses this may be useful. <br><br>  For example, for an online store to easily clarify the delivery condition.  Or for travel agencies, to immediately think over the route of the client from his city and send him a full offer; <br><br><br>  <strong>4. Know which pages the user visited on your site</strong> <br><br>  You know what interests this particular user.  What pages he visited, what products viewed. <br><br>  For example, if he visits a page with the same product for the 3rd time, then you need to push him to purchase.  The service itself will send an automatic message in this case (for example, "hello, Vlad! This ... vacuum cleaner is an excellent choice, and we have the most pleasant price for it"). <br><br>  Such automatic scenarios can be set for any area in the online business. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/aaf/3dd/b5e/aaf3ddb5e35c5d6f723102bb867a2933.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <em>Screenshot of a user card when Carrot Quest</em> <br><br><br>  <strong>5. How many times has a user visited the site</strong> <br><br>  If a user has already logged in several times, but hasn‚Äôt done a targeted action, he may have problems.  This information should be used in the team with the user's actions on the site.  Then it will help you understand the user's thoughts and bring it to the purchase. <br><br><br>  <strong>6. The level of readiness to purchase (scoring score)</strong> <br><br>  Any of the actions on the site can be given a certain number of points. <br><br>  For example, the user viewed the product - 3 points, the user looked at the delivery terms - 5 points, etc.  As a result, for all the actions he gets 25 points.  This makes you realize that he is ready to buy and you need to push him a little so that he buys from you and not from competitors. <br><br>  You assign the number of points for each action yourself, and the service automatically further places them to users. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/980/d94/3ef/980d943efdd6ad4031fbf66ba9405bbe.png" alt="image"><br><br><br>  <strong>7. What buttons, links, pictures he clicked</strong> <br><br>  You can read almost any user actions on the site, what he clicked and where he went. <br><br>  All this information is useful precisely in the aggregate; when looking at the user's card, the sales department will find out in seconds how best to bring the user to the purchase.  Marketers will be able to segment the audience on any parameters and continue working with the whole segment (for example, warm the leads, so that they know you better and are ready to buy).  If you have a small sales department, then it makes sense to focus only on the hottest leads, and the marketer will continue to heat up those who are not yet ready to buy.  So you distribute your opportunities in the optimal order. <br><br><br><br>  <strong>Important:</strong> Any user actions and information about him can be a trigger for the launch of automatic messages in the service.  Thus, the service sends your message only to those segments for which it is intended.  For example, a bonus for those who come for the 5th time, but does not make a targeted action. <br><br>  With pleasure, the <strong><a href="http://www.carrotquest.io/%3Futm_source%3Dmegam%26utm_medium%3Dcontent%26utm_campaign%3Dinformationlead">CarrotQuest</a></strong> team.  A service that collects key information about each visitor to your site and on the basis of it helps to bring them to the purchase, both manually and automatically. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/300480/">https://habr.com/ru/post/300480/</a></p>
