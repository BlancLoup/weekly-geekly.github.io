  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Amazon Rekognition's face recognition system took 28 US congressmen for criminals</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e95/7cd/7ab/e957cd7abbe40bcf66b927dffed78abe.jpg"><br><br>  The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) continues its campaign against the use of face recognition systems by federal agencies and the police.  ACLU insists that the quality of these systems is too low for real use.  As a result, there will be a lot of false positives, which innocent people will suffer.  Trying to convince the US Congress to ban the use of these systems, human rights activists launched a daring but effective action: they drove all American congressmen through the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rekognition/">Amazon Rekognition</a> face recognition system.  The result was a bit predictable: the system <a href="https://www.aclu.org/blog/privacy-technology/surveillance-technologies/amazons-face-recognition-falsely-matched-28">recognized 28 congressmen as criminals</a> .  Photos of "heroes" in the screenshot above. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Amazon aggressively promotes its face recognition system.  Recently it became known that the corporation has <a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/05/22/aclu_amazon_aws_rekognition/">entered into contracts</a> with police units of Washington County, Oregon and Florida.  CEO Jeff Bezos is positioning Rekognition as an effective tool for recognizing faces in real time, including through video streaming, which comes from wearable video cameras on police uniform. <br><br>  This is reminiscent of the system, which this year <a href="https://habr.com/post/371243/">began to be tested</a> in some cities of China, including in the city of Zhengzhou (Henan Province in the east of the central part of China).  There, the police were given special glasses with video cameras, which are also connected to the software for face recognition.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ca/g9/md/cag9mdy_jjitozwau9vwhucblwc.jpeg"><br><br>  Gadgets were issued primarily to the traffic police officers who work at the busy Zhengzhou East Railway Station, because most people pass by before their eyes.  The glasses are specially designed for the police and connected to a handheld computer.  After scanning the passerby‚Äôs face, the computer connects to the central database where the search for matches is performed.  The experiment proved to be effective: by February 6, the police managed to identify seven fugitives who are accused of hiding from the accident scene and human trafficking. <br><br>  But in China, the protection of human rights is treated more condescendingly: <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-asia-china-42248056/in-your-face-china-s-all-seeing-state">170 million surveillance cameras</a> are already working on the streets, which are connected to a single face recognition system.  False positive triggers do not particularly confuse anyone if the system helps to catch real criminals. <br><br>  But American human rights activists believe that false positives are evidence that the system is not yet ready for use. <br><br>  The ACLU test results showed that Rekognition mistakenly mistook images of 28 innocent congressmen as criminals.  Interestingly, the wrong responses are distorted towards black-skinned people.  Among the ‚Äúinjured‚Äù congressmen, 39%, although in reality black congressmen constitute only 20% of the lower house of parliament.  These results confirm the concerns of black representatives, which are set out in the Congressional Black Caucus <a href="https://cbc.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx%3FDocumentID%3D896">letter</a> to Amazon, that using the face recognition system may have ‚Äúdeep negative unintended consequences‚Äù for black people, illegal migrants and protesters.  In fact, there are signs that the system is often mistaken when comparing black people, especially women. <br><br>  Well, in general, everyone got under the distribution - both Democrats, Republicans, men and women of all ages from different regions of the country.  They all fell into the number of system errors. <br><br>  Representatives of the ACLU believe that every false positive act endangers a person‚Äôs freedom.  A police officer may discriminate against such a person by subjecting him to an interrogation or search. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/203/0a2/dae/2030a2dae97160126c8b7aa48ed7e01b.jpg"><br><br>  The scan was made on the public Amazon Rekognition service, the cost of the service was $ 12.33.  For comparison with photos, 535 congressmen and senators selected 25,000 publicly available photos of people in handcuffs.  The test was conducted with the default settings.  28 errors mean about 5% of false positives.  Theoretically, this may be a good result, but if you apply it on thousands of people, this means a lot of innocent people who are subjected to searches due to a program error. <br><br>  Of course, all the results of the program will be tested by people, but we all know that such systems can quickly get out of control and go into automatic mode, as happened with the system of issuing speeding tickets. <br><br>  The ACLU called on Congress to ‚Äúintroduce a moratorium‚Äù on the use of this technology until it begins to produce acceptable accuracy. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/418509/">https://habr.com/ru/post/418509/</a></p>
