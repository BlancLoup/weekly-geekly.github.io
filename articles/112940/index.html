      Corporate customers will be able to back up important business information: <br>  ‚Ä¢ documents and files of various types, folders from personal computers of company employees; <br>  ‚Ä¢ corporate correspondence by e-mail; <br>  ‚Ä¢ 1C database and other accounting software; <br>  ‚Ä¢ data from corporate servers running Windows Server, Mac Server and Linux; <br>  ‚Ä¢ data from Microsoft Exchange Server; <br>  ‚Ä¢ MS SQL Server and mySQL databases. <br><br>  The solution offered by Infobox is focused mainly on the needs of business customers, for which the priorities are high reliability and uninterrupted service, greater security, greater flexibility and ease of implementation.  The new product meets all these characteristics. <br><br>  Technically, the Backup it solution meets all modern requirements for information systems of high availability and reliability and is built on a cluster running Windows Server 2008 R2. <br><br>  Backup it is easy to use.  Backup it is installed on the computer once, after which the user creates one or several tasks (copy creation schedules) and an encryption key.  Then you can forget about the existence of the program.  At the right time, the program will automatically record any changes in the files and send them to the server.  After completing each task, the user receives an email notification of the changes made. <br>  Distributions for Windows, Linux and Mac are available to our customers. <br>  In the event of loss or damage to the computer, you can install the Backup it client on a new computer and perform the above actions. <br>  If data has been lost, Backup it can easily recover it.  To do this, just select the necessary documents and click on the ‚ÄúRecover Now‚Äù button.  The selected files are copied from the server in the data center to your computer. <br><br>  Also, the saved data is accessible from any computer via a web browser using the online control panel. <br><br>  Security is the main issue of concern to customers most when choosing a "cloud" services.  Everyone is afraid of access to their information at a time when the data is on the servers of the artist.  In this regard, the Backup it service is suitable even for the most biased skeptics. <br>  The fact is that all backup copies of data are encrypted using Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) using 128-bit or 256-bit encryption technology.  The encryption key used in the program is not reversible, is set by the end user and is known only to him, so no one else can open the data in backup copies on the Infobox servers.  When restoring data, backups are transferred back to the user's computer and decrypted on the client side. <br>  All communication between the computer and the server takes place through a secure SSL channel and through a secure SOAP / XML interface.  All this ensures reliable transmission and storage of data. <br><br>  Backup is performed by incremental method.  The expediency of this backup method is based on the fact that the bulk of the data is static and does not change.  Studies have shown that only about 5% of the data changes daily. <br>  We took this into account, and Backup it, after creating the first full copy of the information, further analyzes and compares the data since the last copy was created and sends only changes to the server.  This allows you to reduce the amount of traffic, and most importantly reduce the time to create backups. <br><br>  In addition, Backup it uses strong data compression technology, which reduces the size of backup copies of data even more.  Compression, depending on the type of data, averages 50-60% of the original size.  This reduces the size of the required disk space and speeds up the download of backups even with a relatively slow connection to the Internet (for example, ADSL). <br><br>  We understand that we cannot avoid comparisons with similar services, therefore we will immediately mention the most famous of them.  We have already received some reviews and noted that the price is compared first of all, and not the functionality and features of a particular service.  For users who are not demanding of security and functionality, there are free and shareware products on the market, such as Amazon S3, Dropbox, Skydrive, SugarSync, etc. They are fairly simple to use, mostly offering initial free plans with limited space, but in fact offer simple file storage on cloud hosting.  The advantage of Backup it over similar services is, first of all, security and the ability to conveniently work with business data. <br><br>  The most popular counterpart is the overseas Amazon S3.  Its main advantage is cheapness, although on the other hand the price of Backup it is quite comparable.  For example, the cost of a gigabyte at the Home 50 tariff is 7 rubles or 0.23 cents, which, taking into account the unlimited traffic included in the tariff, is not so much different from 15 cents with the free traffic of Amazon S3 solution.  The disadvantages of the latter (in terms of business use) include the impossibility of backing up standard things for many organizations, such as databases, mail servers and some other obviously business-oriented applications. <br><br>  If we talk about Dropbox, then, by and large, the function of Dropbox is to simply synchronize files that are in the same folder with the server, located in the cloud.  The main and fundamental difference between Backup It and Dropbox is the greater flexibility of the first.  Using Backup It, the user has absolute freedom in what, how and when to backup. <br><br>  Not to mention the fact that with an unlimited amount for $ 5, very often there are limitations of various kinds in terms of the contract and data download speed. <br><br>  The issue of security for business users is key.  A robust crypto algorithm and a non-reversible key make the solution we offer ultra-secure.  No one can access user data without knowing the key. <br>  We hope that our experience, reliable solution, legal guarantees of security and confidentiality, SLA will help our customers find a new Infobox service. <br>  Try it and you.  You'll like it! <br><br>  Detailed information about the service and registration for the test period at <a href="http://infobox.ru/backup/">http://infobox.ru/backup/</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/112940/">https://habr.com/ru/post/112940/</a></p>
