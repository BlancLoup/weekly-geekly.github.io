Today we will try to tell about the online magistracy in modern combinatorics through the prism of the just-launched project - MIPT Applied Research Laboratories - Sberbank. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  Many of our students <a href="http://www.omsc.mipt.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dpost_180717">choose the online magistracy</a> precisely because of the possibility of combining work and study.  But we, in fact, are now ready to give our students the opportunity to find a job and continue working on the project.  which they themselves chose during their studies.  That is, we are not even talking about combining, but about the inclusion of work in the educational process.  In particular, several of our students begin work at the <b>Laboratory of Applied Research MIPT - Sberbank.</b>

      This is a real project, launched literally this year, before the staff (and this is already more than 30 people) whose tasks are crucial for the activities of any large bank. <br><br>  <b>Laboratory staff are</b> divided into several groups, each of which is headed by experienced experts: experts in the field of machine learning, graph theory, etc. <br><br>  <b>What tasks are facing the laboratory:</b> <br><br><ul><li>  identifying risks based on an analysis of the Sberbank customer base, as well as forecasting a possible fraud; </li><li>  other problems solved with the help of mathematical modeling; </li><li>  tasks related to the cybersecurity of the bank: biometrics, work with big data (cryptography), modern types of encryption. </li></ul><br>  Students of the online magistracy have the opportunity not only to practice their knowledge in practice, but also to become employees of the Laboratory and develop in the chosen field both professionally and professionally. <br><br>  Moreover, although studying in the online magistracy, as we have said, is paid, the work on the projects of the Laboratory is officially paid. <br><br>  Below we give the opinion of one of our students who chose the Laboratory as a practice.  We hope that this will help you in making a decision on admission to the online magistracy of MIPT.  And just in case we remind you that admission to the online magistracy ends.  <a href="http://www.omsc.mipt.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dpost_180717">You can leave a request on the site</a> . <br><br><blockquote>  My name is Roman Pilyugin, I study in the online master's ‚ÄúModern combinatorics‚Äù MIPT.  My supervisor is Trenin Sergey Alekseevich.  I was very lucky to get to him, and he offered me to join the MIPT-Sbertech organizing laboratory.  By this time, I had the opportunity to attend MIPT on weekdays twice a week without problems with my main job and I took advantage of it.  Since I only prepared documents at MIPT, I cannot tell you how the laboratory works, but I have certain expectations.  As I understand it, besides theoretical studies, there is a clear focus on the practical side of the problems, technical and technological problems are being solved.  For me it is an opportunity to apply the knowledge gained in practice and touch on tasks taken from life, with their complex wording and sometimes a heuristic approach.  In addition, it is a rare opportunity to work as a team with people who are in the forefront of science in Russia.  I think it will be an invaluable experience for me. </blockquote></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/333638/">https://habr.com/ru/post/333638/</a></p>
