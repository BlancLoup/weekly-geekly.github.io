  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How SkyLink tried to take all my money and how I managed to get every penny</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In order to constantly be online, including when traveling to the country, I bought a SkyLink modem with a tariff for Internet access last year.  I use it, naturally, only in summer, and the rest of the time it lies idle.  At the end of last summer, when the need for a modem disappeared, I checked the balance - there were 693 rubles.  The amount recorded and forgotten about SkyLink before this summer, because  The tariff was no monthly fee.  Getting ready for a new summer season, I recently went to check the balance.  93 rubles left on the account. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I climbed up to look at the terms of my fare, read the contract  Nowhere has it been said that I have to pay something in case of prolonged non-use, but because  tariff without subscription fees - in theory, those 693 rubles should have remained safe and sound.  Forced blocking was also not registered for my tariff. <br><br>  Because  SkyLink has a paid specification, I did it differently - I requested invoices for services for all those months when I didn‚Äôt use it.  Accounts they provide for free in electronic form.  Because  I am sure that from September 2009 to April 2010 I did not use a modem, then the first (and only) non-zero account showed me the month when I was charged 600 rubles.  It was March 2010.  There was only one line <strong>‚ÄúOthers‚Äù in it - 600 rubles</strong> .  And that's all. <br><br>  I called SkyLink support with the natural question ‚ÄúWhere is the money, Zin?‚Äù.  The girl disconnected, she was gone for a long time and then apologized for the delay. <em>‚ÄúYou haven't used a modem for a long time and therefore we decided to charge you 6 packages of 100 MB for only 600 rubles (100 RE for a package of 100 MB)‚Äù</em> .  Those.  they just took it and decided to charge it for my money.  It cannot disconnect, it cannot be said on what grounds it was done either.  I did not load it with references to the laws and just hung up.

      Those.  it just happened that SkyLink, seeing that the number was not used for a long time and has money on it, just gave me its own traffic packages and wrote off the money for it.  And packages have a validity period - i.e.  did not use - and megabytes and money burn down.  This is what the devil pulled me to check the balance now, not in June ... Therefore, I saw. <br><br>  He sat down, wrote an official statement, sent them an e-mail.  A few minutes later I went to check the balance - and oh, a miracle, everyone gave me a penny.  And even no one was screwed up with me, nor sent me to read the contract, and other documents.  Just returned the money a few hours after receiving the application. <br><br>  In general, it is clear why they do it - just to reset the accounts of users who have not used their modems for a long time.  The ‚ÄúBig Three‚Äù makes it somehow slower, writing off 100 rubles a month by transferring it to tariffs with a subscription fee, and SkyLink decided not to bathe and zero it in one fell swoop.  "And what, we gave you the traffic packets ...".  Here are just no one ordered these packages ... <br><br>  Actually, why am I writing all this here - those who have a modem and SkyLink tariff, with no subscription fee, who have not used their modem for a long time and have money left in their account - go check your balance and look at the charges and charges statistics.  Perhaps you also connected these miracle traffic packets without your consent. <br><br>  Well, for those who are ‚Äúlucky enough‚Äù to receive these packages, here is a letter for cancellation: <br><br><blockquote>  To customer service department <br>  OJSC Moscow Cellular Communications <br><br>  from: name <br>  personal account: XXX <br>  phone number: XXX <br>  Passport: No. XXXXXX Ser.  Xxxx <br>  when issued: XX.XX.XXXX <br>  Issued by: XXXXXXXX <br><br>  STATEMENT <br><br>  In the month of _________, I was provided with traffic packages that I did not order and did not give permission to withdraw funds from my personal account in the amount of _______ rubles. <br><br>  The procedure for changing the terms of the contract between the consumer and the cellular operator is defined by the ‚ÄúRules for the provision of mobile communications‚Äù approved by the Russian Government.  According to this document, the change is possible only in two ways: by concluding an additional agreement in writing or by making the subscriber so-called implicit actions, that is, actions that clearly indicate that he agrees to the changes and accepts them.  Among these actions may, for example, be a call to the operator with a request to connect it to a new service, sending an SMS message, etc.  The silence of the subscriber by such an action cannot by definition. <br><br>  Because  I did not make any conclusive actions to connect traffic packages, did not conclude an additional agreement in writing, I consider giving me a traffic package not legal and ask me to return all the funds written off to me in the amount of _______ rubles and cancel the Traffic Packs service provided without my consent . <br><br>  Respectfully, <br>  Full name <br><br>  date <br></blockquote><br><br>  Print the letter, sign and scan.  Scan sent to info@skylink.msk.ru <br>  Checked - money back on the same day. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/91465/">https://habr.com/ru/post/91465/</a></p>
