I hope from the appeal itself it is clear that I do not accept your proposal to switch to ‚Äúyou‚Äù and, at the same time, I do not refer you to those with whom you can talk to ‚ÄúYou (with a capital letter)‚Äù.  I think you will not object to such a compromise.

      I must say, your indignation about my note is quite understandable.  The note turned out to be the most intensively readable blog and was among the recommended ones.  During her peak hours (below, I will explain why I emphasize this), 2/3 of News2.ru visitors voted.  At the same time, it seemed to me that at least half of those who agreed with me, like you, immediately recognized one of the main anonymous heroes of the note.  And this is doubly insulting.  Hence your repeated ‚Äúidiot‚Äù, ‚Äúgarbage‚Äù, ‚Äústupidity‚Äù, ‚Äúdregs‚Äù, ‚Äúder * mo‚Äù and the like.  Proving something nasty is weak, therefore the classical method of the little men is applied to transfer the discussion to the plane ‚ÄúA fool!‚Äù Familiar to them. Thank you, at least this time you regretted and decided not to beat the snout.  With many others, you have dealt more ferociously.  By the way, a passing question to your review.  In what ‚Äúcontext‚Äù can one ‚Äúdrive into the snout‚Äù, and in which it is impossible?  Here and everywhere further in quotes tried to conclude only your phrases.  An interested outsider with a gas mask will easily find them (and many similar ones) at the above addresses or by running through the complete collection of your essays on News2.ru.  (Sorry, comments - alas, I did not find your own original content) <br><br>  I am not a deputy, I don‚Äôt intend to sue you.  Although Alknisa is well aware of this (!) Question.  All your pearls, of course, survive.  First, because life has hardened me in polemics with much stronger opponents than you.  True, the intelligence of those of my opponents did not allow them to get personal in the most cruel disputes.  Secondly, because I am confident in myself and believe in my analytical capabilities.  I have what has been done and achieved behind my back, one tenth of which for you would already have meant knowingly lived life.  <b>I will survive that, but how many specialists, including real or potential ‚Äúcontent carriers‚Äù, faced with such ‚Äúcriticism‚Äù, will they not want to work with News2.ru anymore (in any case, to work actively)?</b> <br><br>  Our ‚Äúgang‚Äù (your characteristic of News2.ru toli, in general, the toli of the group of its top participants, did not understand) will manage, you say.  I have no doubt, and that is what I‚Äôm afraid of.  <b>I am afraid that such sites will soon become an element of adolescent culture and the patrimony of various IT people.</b>  However, youth fashion comes and goes, but you can't do business on people, even if they consider themselves programmers.  Social networks and so today sheer losses.  Especially, if we take into account the tendency of appearance in more youth-oriented projects like MySpace of mechanisms for entering, ranking and tracking news.  All this begins to understand the majority of professionals.  I have already told somewhere in my blog about clan issues that digg began to encounter.  As well as about the other problem of this site, conceived as a resource of quality news for educated people and gradually slipping from this niche. <br><br>  I also understand that critics are by definition tough people.  But I have never before encountered a situation when vacuum trucks part-time work as critics.  Probably, the daily ‚Äúraking up of dirt (informational)‚Äù - so, approximately, you yourself described your professional activity, it still leaves some imprint on the little men.  So maybe Caesar Caesar?  And then this performance - more than 3,000 votes only in the recommended news, about the same number of comments, and all for 9 months!  You carry a heavy cross, you can only sympathize. <br><br>  Could you advise you to read the recently appeared draft Code of Honor for bloggers.  With some modifications, it is easy to extend it to the whole Web 2.0.  However, I do not think that will help.  Codes of Honor is not for the little evil men.  After all, only their thoughts are worthy of being considered an ‚Äúopinion‚Äù.  Thoughts of <i><b>all the others</b></i> are ‚Äústupid gong of stupid‚Äù people, which, naturally, should be kept to yourself.  <b>Such people, creeping out of the virtual world into the real world, start beating people of Caucasian nationality or anyone else there to save Russia (remember your passage about ‚Äúforged boots‚Äù?).</b>  <b>Or shoot their classmates in American schools.</b> <br><br>  By the way, as the lessons of the latest American tragedy showed, little people love to "promote" themselves.  For this, they are even ready to accept death.  Alas, you must thank me for my work, saving you from such a sad outcome.  And most importantly, for free ... <br><br>  I admit, at first I wanted to call this note "Jupiter, you are angry ...".  Everything was suitable for the situation, except for one.  I did not want to insult the memory, although pagan, but still God by comparison with the Little Evil Man.  Only here <b>for the Internet hurt!</b> <br><br>  Without any respect, <br>  amilner <br><br>  The full text of the letter (with all links) is published in <a href="http://www.itechbridge.com/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D13003">www.itechbridge.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=13003</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/7836/">https://habr.com/ru/post/7836/</a></p>
