And then there was an almost detective story with the participation of the application "Parking", "State Services of Moscow".  However, everything ended well ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  For a start - a small educational program to understand the story.  Horseless will be useful, and owners of cars can scroll. <br><br>  Any car in the territory of the Russian Federation has several identifiers.  The first (and main) is the VIN (Vehicle Identification Number).  It does not change throughout the life of the machine. <br>  Next is the TCP (vehicle passport).  Issued when the machine crosses the borders of the Russian Federation or when it leaves the factory for sale.  In 90% of cases, the number of this document does not change (unless the free space runs out or it can be lost). <br>  After the purchase and registration of the car registration certificate is issued (JTS) and state numbers.  STS changes every time with the change of the owner of the car, the numbers may also change, and (more recently) can be transferred to the new owner. <br><br>  One more thing.  Previously, when selling a car, the owner himself had to deregister it, and after the completion of the transaction, the buyer had to deliver it (in his own name).  But more recently, the car has become possible to sell under a simple contract of sale, without removing from the account.  The new owner makes both procedures at the same time within ten days.  For safety net from a negligent buyer, the seller can come to the MREO with a purchase agreement and remove the car from the post factum registration.

      So, this was all a saying, and now a fairy tale.  In November last year, I sold my car under a simple sales contract.  The buyer assured me that he had re-registered the car for himself, though leaving the old numbers (this is legal, I had nothing against it).  Thus, the number of the ITS should change, and the VIN and the number of the PTS (and state number, of course) remain old, which is logical. <br><br>  Two months later, a strange notice of a fine came to the official application of "Parking" and "Moscow State Services" ... <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Two screens</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/22e/2f6/f72/22e2f6f7293c41158cb4b892a54c7fca.jpg" alt="image"><br></div></div><br><br>  The license plate of the car was correct, but the owner‚Äôs name didn‚Äôt tell me anything (my buyer‚Äôs name was different). <br>  At first I thought that this was a mistake.  Then - what a divorce.  And then - thought. <br><br>  The fact is that the search for a fine in the State Services of Moscow is carried out after entering the state number of the car and the number of ITS, and in the Parkings - only by the number of ITS.  But after all, after registering a car with a new owner, this number should definitely be different!  For the experiment, I put the "Parking" application on a clean device and entered my old car data there.  And then he again saw this mysterious fine ... <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Filing Request Form</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4f8/5a6/407/4f85a64072f74251b1816b18aaa48c43.png" alt="image"><br></div></div><br><br>  I repent, I panicked at this place and rushed into the MREO.  There, a sweet girl in the form of a junior lieutenant, asking for my passport and sales contract, checked on the basis of the fact of removing the car from the register.  It turned out that my buyer honestly reissued the car on himself (as he said), and a short time later he sold it (which is also not forbidden).  So my faith in people was restored, and an unfamiliar name was also explained in the fine order.  But why is my old STS (already twice as irrelevant) still ‚Äúbreaking through‚Äù?  Having calmed down and having drunk mint liqueur (in honor of getting rid of hemorrhoids in the form of walking on instances), I began to argue. <br><br>  There is a database error.  And this applies only to mobile applications (if you log into Mosuslugi from the desktop - no penalty is sought for the same data).  And then I thought that programmers could use its VIN number (or TCP number) as an unconditional machine identification.  I know for sure that in MREO there is a database in which the VIN-code of the car, the VTS and the data of its owners (all), including the CTS numbers, are uniquely compared.  The logic of the program is obvious: after receiving from the user the STS number of the machine, by which it is necessary to look for fines, an appeal is made to some database in which the VIN or TCP of the machine is assigned to this data.  And fines of the current owner and other scales are attached to it.  Thus, by the way, I found my own fines paid a year ago. <br><br>  It is also obvious that the program does NOT refer directly to the traffic police database.  Personally, I would not give such access in order to avoid abuses.  This means that there is some kind of periodic data upload.  Considering the fact that I sold the car in November 2015, and in the program another's fine for a ghost machine is still being searched for, this unloading either broke, or does not work correctly.  Well, or from it do not clean out the old rooms STS.  And it‚Äôs also interesting - can the current owner of the car see <b>my</b> old fines?  Personal data keepers cry nervously in the corner ... <br><br>  Why am I doing all this?  Trust people, but check them out.  Moreover, there are almost no queues in the MREO now, because there you can sign up through all the same Gosuslugs ... <br><br>  Take care of yourself and nerves! <br><br>  UPD: If someone recently sold a car - try to put a <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dru.mos.parking.mobile">‚ÄúParking‚Äù</a> for the sake of laughter and break through your old CTC number. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/357024/">https://habr.com/ru/post/357024/</a></p>
