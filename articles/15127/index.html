The head crackled, sparks ran between the meanders.  It is at such moments that the most stupid and useless ideas about the continuation of being, its texture and quality come. <br><br>  I hardly got up, I looked up at the monitor of the always-on computer, scored a website url from one page and a pseudo-star gifted to a wonderful girl.  The results of the issue showed that the link is regularly posted.  I tried to smile and almost fell from the chair.  More than once already smart people (who recognized themselves?) From all sides of the ball told me that such a domain simply should not be empty.  I couldn‚Äôt agree with them - having armed myself with a strange editor and with scant knowledge of ashtiemel, I did what I did.  Half a year has passed.  ‚ÄúWhat's next?‚Äù - this thought wanders around the neighborhood and regularly visits.  Since I do not have the right experiences, budgets, brilliant ideas, then let others use this domain and do everything they want with it, everything they can bring to them (us, you, anyone) any kind of benefit, be it PR, bablos traffic <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  But freedom - there is a conscious need - and ends where the freedom of another begins.  And I love jazz, improvisation and a little bit of crazy people ... Is there such people here?

      In general, we need a certain number of volunteers (so far about 10).  What they have to create is everything that they wish ... if a simple majority agrees with it.  Also, anyone can refuse at any time and withdraw from the Argonauts.  So who do we need and why <br><br>  The person who understands ashtiemel, the publication of pages and server settings. <br><br>  Copywriter-writer - one who just loves to write and knows the keys of control tse and ve. <br><br>  Photographer, photo correspondent, photographer - or just a man with a soap box, who has (or not) what to say to the world. <br><br>  Designer, illustrator, artist - no matter if you paint with oil on canvas or yogurt on puz, you just need a person who would ‚Äúbrighten up‚Äù our web experiences. <br><br>  A person who is friends with some bloggers and veterans (for example WordPress) - Temko change, screw the plugin, set up registration. <br><br>  A man with a video camera - video content is also useful. <br><br>  A manager - well, there are maniacs, managers)))) maybe he will find a kamikaze company that wants to place an advertisement with us))) again - there will be something to drink mulled wine ... <br><br>  If there is a desire to meet once every two or three weeks somewhere on the weekend - to communicate. <br><br>  We obviously do not poputi with academicians and bore.  Basics  requirement - AHP. <br><br>  Let's go further: how the process will be organized ... Very simple.  Someone suddenly wants to have an orange parrot upside down on the main one, who will greet everyone with greetings in different languages ‚Äã‚Äã... Ok.  If the majority agrees with this (the one who disagrees - offers his own).  Then the task, approximate time frame and op.  Voila - we already have an inverted orange parrot painted with yogurt on the belly on the main one.  Fine - isn't it? <br><br>  What do we make of it? <br>  Live) Rock concert) Reality show) Let's make the broadcast of the development blog on jike, jehe and tepe.  Discussions on the server will be open for reading on translators - for commenting).  And so on - "think of something." <br><br>  What do we get from this? <br>  What we want + a little more. <br><br>  Guarantees. <br>  So far, only my emergency.  (no one has complained yet).  If a tangible movement appears, we will capitalize and distribute options to all participants of this madness. <br><br>  How to get? <br>  We are not interested in who you are or where from.  We are wondering if you will have a couple of hours of internet per day (most likely late at night) to play this game ... and ... where do your hands grow from.  So write anywhere.  Here, on the soap AlisherYakupov FAMILY gmail DOT com, in the comments ... <br><br>  How to fall? <br>  Probably something will be like Dead Idle - if more than a week - avtogudby and where are you, a new star ... <br><br>  I summarize. <br>  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe project is its absence.  It will change with us. <br>  Content of the project - the process of its development. <br>  The goal of the project is a good mood. <br>  Project site - <a href="http://www.vsehorosho.ru/">www.vsehorosho.ru</a> <br><br>  Eh, zaminusyat ... before losing speech) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/15127/">https://habr.com/ru/post/15127/</a></p>
