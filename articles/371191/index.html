  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Back packodualism: after 3 months of using Bobby Bizz</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I adore backpacks.  The backpack is the greatest invention of mankind.  It allows you to free your hands, as opposed to packages, and correctly distribute the weight on the shoulders and lower back, in contrast to the bags-to-one-shoulder.  I don‚Äôt like one thing only: a backpack is not something with which you can come to a meeting with important guys in suits. <br><br>  Especially if you put on a suit too.  So either tolerate something of indeterminate shape on the shoulder, or carry an uncomfortable bag that either takes a hand or pulls one shoulder off.  Pain. <br><br>  Therefore, as soon as I saw the Bobby Bizz backpack roller, I immediately asked the guys from Madrobots to let me play it.  I will not lie to you that I bought it for my own - we all understand that even if I had done this, no one would have believed me.  The only thing they asked for in return was to write their impressions about this backpack.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zg/rh/xw/zgrhxw6xy22q8r5lfsnobsolomc.jpeg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Once promised - you have to do.  But since I no longer work there, I can not pay attention to the colleagues yelling, ‚ÄúWell, Vlaaaad, well, remove that piece about the poorly opening lid of the slow cooker,‚Äù and finally give free rein to your hands, describing everything as it is. <br><br>  I honestly dragged this backpack more than two months, and I can more or less clearly tell about all the pros and cons.  I would have dragged more, but I was forced to write at least something: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ag/ll/o7/agllo7_qvzeu31ebh2benseclgw.png"><br><br>  ÔøºWe are gone.  It will not be boring. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#00b5f3">‚ñ∫</font> What is who <br></h2>  To begin with, I will tell about the backpack itself, for those who have not read <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/madrobots/blog/295775/">this</a> post.  I will describe the backpack myself briefly enough: I do not want to repeat myself, talking about how it works, but I want to focus on the impressions of its use. <br><br>  Bobby Bizz is a ‚Äútransformer backpack‚Äù.  It can be worn as on a shoulder, just like a regular backpack, or you can unfasten the straps and put them in a special compartment and carry it as a bag. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ze/pz/gh/zepzghpu5eoyjzcpcf7lwztufbu.jpeg"><br><br>  This contributes to a rigid frame, which at the same time helps the backpack to keep its shape, and protect the internal contents from shocks.  Hard frame - a rarity among backpacks.  Only occasionally there are backpacks with a rigid back, but for the first time I see this kind of frame running along the perimeter. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xy/rd/v2/xyrdv2rgktt82yuzpixnztn9uts.jpeg"><br><br>  The outer surface of the backpack, according to the manufacturers, is protected from attempts to cut it.  Hard frame is not there, but it contains a sheet of polypropylene, which is not amenable to the blade.  By the way, the logo and the strip, though small, but reflective.  Stated that will be visible 100 meters. <br><br>  I didn‚Äôt check the protection against the cut; it‚Äôs a pity, but I completely believe that the surface is thick and rather thick.  Unfortunately, not thick enough to hold the shape in any conditions like sidewalls.  If you press on it, it will miss inside. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ig/ka/bc/igkabcf6n8vllecpa2kmtlw2-wm.jpeg"><br><br>  The backpack is protected from pickpockets: the zipper of the main compartment is facing the back, which leaves no chance to open it unnoticed for the one who wears it at the moment. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/m9/8a/vq/m98avqfdpvjswupe1l1kdpjgtuu.jpeg"><br><br>  In addition, on one of the straps of the backpack there is a metal braided cable and a combination lock. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/8t/pu/t4/8tput4uitiypsyqgwbkdjm3_zmy.jpeg"><br><br>  It is not very impressive and will not resist any serious nippers, but it will protect you from the situation ‚Äúsomeone ran away with my backpack‚Äù or even prevent you from trying to do it with a view of a fastened backpack. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/02e/3a6/540/02e3a6540bc5f3df35fc28087e4a4d08.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  On the back of the backpack there is a special strap, which is put on the suitcase handle. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pr/cq/bj/prcqbje_t950lpbwiawmemejgia.jpeg"><br><br>  I do not really understand the need, but let it be.  Probably, this is for those cases when your back is occupied with one backpack, your hands are occupied with a suitcase, and there is no place to put a second backpack in ‚Äúbag mode‚Äù.  I don‚Äôt have a suitcase, so I had to find a picture from Google again: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/7y/db/hx/7ydbhxncerqejki4rx83lvffhj0.jpeg"><br><br>  On the straps of the backpack there are pockets in which several cards fit: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ls/d6/qp/lsd6qpcdqzeeh5kq2pdogff9hzk.jpeg"><br><br>  Unfortunately, neither the zippers nor the gum on these pockets are present, which is why cards are prone to falling out. <br><br>  On the inside (from the back) in addition to the main compartment, there is another small pocket: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/sn/un/hn/snunhnezaoqfgas4efd0uzno53q.jpeg"><br><br>  Because of its location, it is as protected from pickpockets as the main compartment, but open it faster.  The developers suggest that it will be used if the phone is powered by a battery inside the backpack, because a wire with a connector goes into this pocket: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/yc/rg/nj/ycrgnjm-2aeg0ba88pkhhdcllce.jpeg"><br><br>  The second part, with a plug, is inside the backpack: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/dr/hd/s3/drhds3jdoh_0ygujgqh5iyasbsi.jpeg"><br><br>  It should be stuck in the poverbank, after which it will no longer be necessary to get into the backpack for the sake of the phone charging from the battery - it will be possible to climb into the pocket.  True, if you need to press a button on it to turn on the crib, the scheme will immediately become not so convenient. <br>  Inside the backpack there is a compartment for a laptop, closed with an elastic velcro: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/1i/i_/gw/1ii_gwi1x35iawbzn3sjsyx-tjm.jpeg"><br><br>  I would even say for two laptops: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/3m/6d/yc/3m6dycwlfp180paiske_qpnma4g.jpeg"><br><br>  By the way, there is a code for verification on the backpack tag, which can be entered on the <a href="https://www.xd-design.com/verify">website</a> : <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/9t/ju/cn/9tjucncft0wdvjaccchteydowqa.jpeg"><br><br>  Unless, of course, you can handle the captcha.  I managed far from the first time. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/bd/ey/us/bdeyuspjokrgcnu3jzkp2kjdyry.png"><br><br>  But in general, the ‚ÄúINSTRUCTION MANUAL‚Äù field is much more interesting on the tag: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/g-/gg/x9/g-ggx9nebdmyzfdmjs2wtgnwwwc.jpeg"><br><br><h2>  <font color="#00b5f3">‚ñ∫</font> Pros and cons, mixed </h2><br><h4>  <font color="#00b5f3">+</font> Has a hard frame </h4><br>  Hard frame - this is convenient.  It protects sheets of paper from being crushed, and the edges of the laptop - from dents, in the case when a door or a jamb meets the contents of a backpack.  Due to the fact that the backpack keeps its shape, things inside, with the right layout, do not interfere in a handful, but remain in their places.  Is it heavy?  For me, no.  But it is heavier than most backpacks, and it may seem heavy to someone.  It weighs 1.3kg.  My last backpack weighed about 600g.  But considering that my backpack in full load weighs 4.6 kg, the extra half-kilogram does not play a special role for me. <br><br><h4>  <font color="#ff0000">-</font> Angular and hard </h4><br>  The same frame that kept things intact inside has a reverse side: it‚Äôs extremely difficult to stuff a backpack ‚Äúwell, a bit more‚Äù.  At some point, it is filled, and no longer fits into it, even though you burst.  Plus, even in a completely empty backpack there is a restriction on the width of the object inside: it normally climbs up to 9 cm, and it will not work to stick more than 10-11 centimeters - the backpack is designed to be flat, and there is nothing to spoil the designer's plan!  Because of this, I had to give up my favorite bottle shaker. <br><br><h4>  <font color="#00b5f3">+</font> Looks good and transforms. </h4><br>  Want to make an impression - made a bag from a backpack.  Tired of carrying in his hand - he made a backpack and put it on his back.  Perhaps not for all this is important, but for me it is a pretty nice bonus - the opportunity to come to a meeting with a classic bag, and not with a backpack behind your back.  And in fact, and in another form, it looks very good.  Approximately how the S-class is compared to other machines: it carries both, but the first one looks better! <br><br><h4>  <font color="#ff0000">- The</font> handle of the portfolio could be more convenient. </h4><br>  A niggle, but still, I would not give up on a softer handle: if I carry it in a briefcase in my bare hand, my hand quickly gets tired.  There is no such effect in gloves. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/bf/kv/to/bfkvtoli9nx0jyn-afzlq4iydy8.jpeg"><br><br>  The inner distance from the handle to the surface is not very big: my hand fits normally, but still slightly, and my fingers would start to rub against the fabric. <br><br><h4>  <font color="#00b5f3">+</font> Tight fit: comfortable to wear </h4><br>  Due to the rigid frame, things inside the backpack are not distributed evenly, but evenly.  The backpack always keeps its shape and, therefore, the flat surface of the back wall, which adds convenience to wearing.  The rest of the backpacks for this had to put a laptop :) <br><br><h4>  <font color="#ff0000">-</font> Tight to the back: no air access </h4><br>  In the summer, this plus will turn into a minus: there is no channel for ventilation, so the back will sweat.  In Bizz, however, there is a small odds compared to other backpacks: if it is very hot, you can always convert it into a briefcase and take it in your hand.  The hand, of course, will tire faster, but the back will not sweat. <br><br><h4>  <font color="#00b5f3">+</font> Rain Protection </h4><br>  As the manufacturer promises, the backpack is protected from water.  Of course, when falling into the water, things are unlikely to remain dry, but in the process of use, I fell a couple of times under quite heavy rain (yes, this is such a crap winter), and I testify that it protects the backpack from even quite heavy rain. <br><br><h4>  <font color="#ff0000">-</font> No legs </h4><br>  Another problem is that you can not put a backpack on the floor - the fabric, which is covered with sidewall, immediately gets dirty.  The legs, which usually take over the protection from dirt is not here - neither from the bottom nor from the side.  And they would not have prevented, the sides of the backpack look beautiful, but they get dirty easily. <br><br><h4>  <font color="#00b5f3">+</font> Intrusion protection </h4><br>  Not so much protection plays a role, as simply the absence of pockets on the outside.  It allows you to simply forget that you need to control all the time who is there behind your back and if he wants to pull something out of the backpack.  I only used the cable and the combination lock once, but it was quite convenient. <br><br><h4>  <font color="#ff0000">-</font> Inconvenient access inside and the inability to fasten the cover </h4><br>  In ordinary backpacks, how?  He unzipped the zipper, put his hand inside.  The fabric is soft, so you can literally unzip the zipper literally a dozen or two centimeters - if only your hand would fit.  With Bobby Bizz, unfortunately, this is not a ride - in order to get at least something from the inside, you need to unzip the zipper to the width of the upper part, at least so that you can bend the lid a little and put your hand in it.  And if you need to get something that lies at the very bottom of the backpack, you will have to almost unzip the zipper. <br><br>  Now imagine - you came to work, put a backpack next to the table.  You need, for example, a flash drive, which is stored in the lower pocket of a backpack.  They unzipped the zipper completely, took out the flash drive ... It is necessary to fasten the zipper back, otherwise the back of the backpack can lie back on the floor and scatter all the things in its pockets: there is no way to fix the open cover of the backpack. <br><br>  Yes, there are such things that should prevent this: a kind of "membrane" at the bottom, which do not allow the backpack to open more than necessary: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/c6/ki/84/c6ki84phyaq-xycktprkyqupd-u.jpeg"><br><br>  But the problem is that they themselves prevent to open the backpack to the full, and without it it‚Äôs much harder to pack things.  The usual position of the backpack in the process of filling - with a lid, open 180 degrees. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/hc/xj/1o/hcxj1ov-ukk6v1lroe9p1ukllck.jpeg"><br><br>  So, the membrane interfere with it, and they have to tear off each time with a bang, and then unfasten the button.  And then gently (otherwise the response will not fall into the button) to stick back.  Furious.  Therefore, after a couple of times they were folded and stuck with a velcro to the pocket mesh: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/5q/k5/hq/5qk5hqhnui5itxxi1mq6aqf1vwk.jpeg"><br><br><h2>  <font color="#00b5f3">‚ñ∫</font> Conclusion </h2><br>  So, what can I say after two months of use? <br><br>  This is one of the coolest backpacks I've ever had.  He is stylish, beautiful, plus, with it you can not be afraid that someone will pull something out of his pocket in a crowded car.  However, one has to pay for these two things by reducing the convenience of use: access to the contents is not as fast and convenient as in ordinary backpacks. <br><br>  The third "feature" is that it can be a light movement of the hand (in fact, not so easy, but still, quickly enough) converted into a briefcase-bag.  Again, using such a hybrid is not as convenient as a bag or backpack individually, but there's nothing you can do. <br><br>  There are some drawbacks in the design, which I hope will be fixed in the next version.  They do not interfere with use. <br><br>  Total: Despite the shortcomings, it is very suitable.  I continue to enjoy using it. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#00b5f3">‚ñ∫</font> Where to buy </h2><br>  Buy <a href="http://madrobots.ru/p/xd-design-bobby-bizz/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dbobby_bizz_vvz">it is clear where</a> .
