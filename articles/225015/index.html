The creators of Puzzle &amp; Dragons plan to release Puzzle &amp; Dragons W - an extension of the game-in-game class.  What is this?  Puzzle &amp; Dragons with the ability to choose a simplified, if I may say so, game mode: ‚ÄúTamadoro Mode‚Äù - fewer dragons, more puzzles!  Without the study of dungeons, but with a large number of puzzles and collecting three elements for your pet - head, hands and, taking into account the anatomy of the tamadorka, excuse me, "eggs".  Each of the elements of equipment gives additional capabilities and abilities of the tamarka, and also changes its appearance.  Not bad, huh? <br><br>  Comrades from DeNA are not going to give in on this field, and while GungHo is just planning, they are already <a href="http://www.insidemobileapps.com/2014/05/30/dena-launches-competitive-match-three-puzzle-game-world-of-thingies-on-ios/">releasing a</a> match-three ‚ÄúWorld of Thingies‚Äù.  What brings us the game with such a positive name "World Figovinok", in addition to strange creatures?  Landiland travels and real-time and three-player competition.  In this case, the gameplay pushes to passing in the style of blitz games: the faster a player collects matches, the more he gets combo points, and there he is not far from gain, when collecting on the field causes an abundance of explosions on the field.  Collect Figoviny, strengthen the team, be happy! <br><a name="habracut"></a>

    <h4>  HockeyApp has become more manageable </h4><br>  Last week, one of the most popular application distribution services HockeyApp was updated to <a href="http://hockeyapp.net/blog/2014/05/28/hockeyapp-3-0.html">version 3.0</a> .  We at KamaGames Studio use it in our work, so the latest innovations have already been appreciated.  Innovations are not only in the pricing policy, but also in the management system - now you can use groups for distribution of applications.  Another innovation is the soft setting of notifications, not everyone can always see the rain from the crash notifications. <br><br>  Speaking of crashes.  Crashlytics, which specializes in detecting application crashes, three months after the announcement, released a beta of its application distribution tool.  Thus, HockeyApp and Testflight have another competitor.  Read more about the new product <a href="http://www.crashlytics.com/blog/launching-beta-by-crashlytics/">here</a> . <br><br>  In a niche developer toolkit is getting closer.  The latest news in the same category is the activity of Microsoft, whose new CEO has already declared a mobilization vector.  Microsoft has <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/05/28/microsoft-buys-capptain-a-mobile-app-management-platform-based-in-paris/">bought</a> and plans to integrate Capptain service with its Azure cloud platform, which provides services for analyzing mobile applications and sending push notifications.  It's only the beginning! <br><br><br><h4>  Google launched indexing applications in Russia </h4><br>  May 30, Google launched the indexing of mobile applications in Russia.  Previously, this option was only in English-speaking countries.  Users now have the opportunity to decide whether they want to go to your website or open your Android application on their device and see the content there. <br><br>  The updated Googlebot indexes content in Android applications in the same way as on sites.  The webmaster only needs to specify the desired content using a Sitemap and webmaster tools. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/100/327/5c4/1003275c4dc59840eba5739abcddf9cd.png"><br><br>  Learn more about how to mark the desired content for indexing, read <a href="https://developers.google.com/app-indexing/webmasters/details">here</a> .  And here you can send an application to participate in the application indexing program. <br><br>  It is unlikely that this solution is suitable for games, but, for example, for news and other content applications - this is a very convenient and useful thing. <br><br><br><h4>  Ruzzle will turn into a TV show </h4><br>  Under the brand of the Swedish puzzle, Ruzzle will make a quiz show!  This was <a href="http://variety.com/2014/digital/news/high-noon-entertainment-inks-mobile-game-deal-with-mag-interactive-1201194281/">announced by the</a> television company High Noon Entertainment, specializing in the creation of television series for Hispanic (!) Residents of the United States.  It is not yet known in what format this game will be presented on television, but it will clearly find its audience, which prefers games to television. <br><br>  Ruzzle was the first game of the Swedish company MAG Interactive.  Although it came out in 2012, it gained real popularity only a year later.  The company's profit from this project amounted to more than $ 10 million, and at the end of last year, the venture fund Nokia Growth Partners invested $ 6 million in MAG Interactive. Curiously, will Ruzzle have a second wind on mobile devices after the start of the television show? <br><br><br><h4>  Kabam will release ‚ÄúHunger Games‚Äù </h4><br>  Kabam <a href="http://www.insidemobileapps.com/2014/05/30/kabam-partners-with-lionsgate-for-the-hunger-games-mobile-game">announced</a> its collaboration with the medical company Lionsgates to create a game based on the famous Hunger Games franchise.  The new game will be a mix of RPG and TCG.  Players will need to take on the role of a rebel in the Districts (districts - if you watched a movie in Russian voice acting) and secure their release. <br><br>  The game will be created by the efforts of Kabam's China studio, which already has successful experience in creating games based on well-known franchises.  The Hobbit: Kingdoms of Middle-Earth brought Kabam more than $ 100 million in its first year. <br><br>  This is not the first attempt by Lionsgates to make money on games based on the ‚ÄúHunger Games‚Äù; the previous ones were a failure.  Let's see if this time Lionsgates will succeed with the participation of Kabam to achieve the heights of grossing. <br><br><br><h4>  PS Key indicators of f2p-games </h4><br>  This is not news, but <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/DavidXicota/20140527/218550/Free_to_play_and_its_Key_Performance_Indicators.php">an article on educational information</a> from one of the readers of gamasutra.com.  It will help you quickly figure out what needs to be measured in an f2p game.  Useful for novice indie developers who embark on the f2p trail, and Padawan marketing and analytics.  In addition to the basic concepts in the glossary, the meanings of scary words are described, such as the cost of attracting users - CpA, Chern Rate, how ARPU differs from ARPPU.  What types of payers are in your game and how to distinguish them.  An experienced comrades article is unlikely to open something new. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/225015/">https://habr.com/ru/post/225015/</a></p>
