  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Stars of the world frontend 3. Here the Russian spirit, here Russia smells</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Continuation of the previous two articles - <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/140831/">World Frontend</a> <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/141113/">Stars</a> and <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/141113/">World Frontend Stars 2. JS Lovers</a> . <br>  I understand that both in many companies and web-studios, and among freelancers, there are excellent technologists, front-ends, and js-coders, which can potentially be called frontend stars.  But again, you can not select one point, and the other silent.  Therefore, I decided to tell about those whose names are heard. <br>  Some of them from time to time can be found on Habr√©, many are familiar with them.  If suddenly I missed something important, or someone wants to correct or supplement something, unsubscribe in comments and I will promptly update the article. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4e1/050/ad2/4e1050ad224e168e3f10d1a2aa50da0a.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h3>  Dmitry Soshnikov </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/600/b3a/355/600b3a355e45c586d38c796093bb2308.jpg"><br>  Personal website: <a href="http://dmitrysoshnikov.com/">dmitrysoshnikov.com</a> <br>  Dmitry started to work on the web while he was studying at the university, and after trying out different technology kits, he focused on serious immersion in JavaScript.  Moreover, not only from a practical point of view, but also from a theoretical one - his series ‚ÄúECMAScript Subtleties‚Äù on design and language theory has already been translated into several languages.  Dima periodically participates in online discussions of the TC-39 (ECMAScript Standardization Committee), speaks at specialized conferences, and is also a reviewer of some books on JavaScript, such as Stoyan Stefanov's ‚ÄúJavaScript Patterns‚Äù and several chapters of the next edition of the book ‚ÄúProfessional JavaScript by Nicholas Zakas.  In addition to JS, he is interested in languages ‚Äã‚Äãsuch as Python, Ruby, Lua, CoffeeScript and Erlang, which he has been studying for two years now.  One of the reports on the future of ECMAScript can be found <a href="http://lib.custis.ru/%25D0%2591%25D1%2583%25D0%25B4%25D1%2583%25D1%2589%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B5_ECMAScript_%2528%25D0%2594%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9_%25D0%25A1%25D0%25BE%25D1%2588%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2,_ADD-2011%2529">here</a> .  At the moment, Dmitry is working in <a href="http://facebook.com/">Facebook</a> in the position of Software Engineer, and in those moments when he is not busy with work, he <a href="http://promodj.com/dmitry-soshnikov">writes music</a> in trance and techno style. <br>  Currently, Dmitry is engaged in programming in JavaScript / Erlang and is an ECMAScript theorist.

    <br><h3>  Dmitry Baranovsky (Dmitry Baranovskiy) </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/860/b12/3bc/860b123bcf9dc5d46fee9e62f5fdd50d.jpg"><br>  Personal website: <a href="http://dmitry.baranovskiy.com/">dmitry.baranovskiy.com</a> <br>  At the time when I first entered KNURE, Dmitriy graduated from the KhAI and worked at the famous MaxBill company in Kharkov (in the past).  Being engaged there by rewriting flash controls on SVG, he even then became interested in this technology.  At the moment, Dmitry is known, first of all, by the libraries <a href="http://raphaeljs.com/">Rapha√´l</a> and <a href="http://g.raphaeljs.com/">gRapha√´l</a> , which, using SVG and VML, make it easier to work with vector graphics on the web.  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/41647/">News</a> about this thing appeared on Habr√© back in 2008.  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/96462/">In the summer of 2010,</a> Rapha√´l teamed up with jQTouch and Ext JS, creating the <a href="http://www.sencha.com/">Sencha</a> project.  As a result, Dmitry worked for a year in Sencha in the position of Software Architect. <br>  In addition, Baranovsky has a number of interesting developments, among which <a href="http://microformatique.com/optimus/">Optimus is a transformer of microformats</a> , <a href="http://dmitry.baranovskiy.com/work/csc/">CSC is a conference planner</a> , <a href="http://dmitry.baranovskiy.com/work/fiechart/">JavaScript Pie-chart (interactive graphics)</a> , <a href="http://dmitry.baranovskiy.com/work/lines/">Lines is a popular game on JS</a> , and also <a href="http://dmitry.baranovskiy.com/work/typo/">Typographer</a> .  He currently lives in Australia and works for Digital Five Sydney as an Architect. <br><br><br><h3>  Yuri Zaitsev (Juriy Zaytsev) </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2b7/7f5/be1/2b77f5be15530913af6e7e10262aa2b9.jpg"><br>  Personal website: <a href="http://perfectionkills.com/">perfectionkills.com</a> <br>  Often found on the web under the nickname "kangax", Yuri is known as one of the developers of the core <a href="http://prototypejs.org/core">Prototype.js</a> .  In his free time he does his <a href="http://fabricjs.com/">fabric.js</a> framework, which makes it easy to work with HTML5 canvas.  However, he doesn‚Äôt have much free time - Yura <a href="http://2010.texasjavascript.com/">speaks</a> at various <a href="http://falsyvalues.com/speakers.html">conferences</a> , writes articles on <a href="http://ajaxian.com">Ajaxian</a> , <a href="">Reddit</a> or <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com">Hacker News</a> , and also answers questions on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/130652/kangax">Stack Overflow</a> .  Also, like Dmitry Soshnikov, he enjoys the theory of JavaScript and periodically reads <a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm">ECMAScript</a> specifications.  In addition, Yuri provides consulting services for JS, which have been used by a number of companies, including <a href="http://aptana.com/">Aptana, Inc.</a> <br>  Yura Zaitsev received his education at Moscow State University, and currently lives and works in New York. <br><br><br><h3>  Sergey Chikuyonok </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f3f/c0c/173/f3fc0c17327cb1ed11e251dae966b5a5.jpg"><br>  Personal website: <a href="http://chikuyonok.ru/">chikuyonok.ru</a> <br>  ‚ÄúSergey started working on the web from the age of 13, he worked as a technologist at Lebedev Studio for 4 years and is now engaged in <a href="http://www.imobilco.ru/">Aymobilka</a> .‚Äù  A set of these facts can be found in almost every interview on the Runet‚Äôs open spaces, so it‚Äôs best to put links to some of them: <a href="http://5shots.ru/interviews/97">interviews on 5shots</a> , <a href="http://artjoker.com.ua/ru/blog/zanoza-v-pyatnicu-interwu-s-sergeem-chikuenkom/">interviews on ArtJoker</a> , a large number of <a href="http://conf.404fest.ru/conference/conf-64/">answers to questions</a> in the footsteps of the 404 conference. Those who don‚Äôt like to read can familiarize yourself with the ninth <a href="http://makeitsexy.rpod.ru/190176.html">issue of the podcast ‚ÄúMake me beautiful‚Äù</a> , where he took part and answered questions on the front-end, IDE, optimization and much more within an hour.  Video lovers will also not be offended - you can find records of reports that he did.  For example, from <a href="http://vimeo.com/16638459">404fest</a> . <br>  Personally, I first learned from Chikuenke when the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/76069/">project Zen Coding was presented</a> to Habr√© in 2009, one of the developers of which he was.  A similar <a href="http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2009/11/21/zen-coding-a-new-way-to-write-html-code/">article</a> appeared on smashingmagazine.com, where a stormy discussion unfolded in the comments, with almost 300 comments.  At the same smashingmagazine.com there is a whole <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/author/sergey-chikuyonok/">series of articles by</a> Sergey dedicated to image optimization. <br><br><br><h3>  Vadim Makeev </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/97d/4af/a6b/97d4afa6bc15be111fd88caf09dec1ae.jpg"><br>  Personal website: <a href="http://pepelsbey.net/">pepelsbey.net</a> <br>  As it turned out, the main part of the information that I wanted to write about Vadim, has already been collected and beautifully framed on various resources.  First of all, this is the <a href="http://pepelsbey.net/author/">Author page</a> on his website and the <a href="http://pepelsbey.moikrug.ru/">profile in My Circle</a> .  The following sources of information will be similar to those in the block above ‚Äî the <a href="http://artjoker.com.ua/ru/blog/zanoza-v-pyatnicu-interwu-s-vadimom-makeevim/">first interview</a> , the <a href="http://5shots.ru/interviews/34">second,</a> and the <a href="http://makeitsexy.rpod.ru/199736.html">podcast</a> .  If we take a brief squeeze, we can say that at the moment Vadim is a web evangelist at Opera Software, a web developer, a web standards advocate.  In the past, he worked in such well-known companies as <a href="http://sup.com/">SUP Factory</a> and <a href="http://company.yandex.ru/">Yandex</a> .  As for his social activities, he is in this area - ogogo.  First of all, Vadim is the organizer of <a href="http://web-standards.ru/">the ‚ÄúWeb Standards‚Äù community</a> and regular <a href="http://webstandardsdays.ru/">Web Standards Days conferences</a> , which are held in at least four countries.  Also, he is the ideologue of Zen Coding.  It is quite interesting to watch Vadim on the Internet - in particular, some tricky remarks about the layout of various websites appear on his <a href="https://twitter.com/">Twitter</a> account, and all sorts of useful video reports or interesting interviews appear on his <a href="http://vimeo.com/pepelsbey/videos">channel in Vimeo</a> . <br><br><br><h3>  Vitaly Kharisov </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/95d/94a/4ad/95d94a4ada4185653c35ba6f2642f9a8.jpg"><br>  Personal website: <a href="http://vitaly.harisov.name/">vitaly.harisov.name</a> <br>  It is difficult to find an HTML coder who would not know Kharisov - a person who went from HTML coder (2006) in <a href="http://yandex.ru/">Yandex</a> to the Head of Development in Ukraine, which is logical - after all, Vitaly had been working and working in Simferopol all this time.  He is the ideologue of <a href="http://bem.github.com/bem-method/pages/beginning/beginning.ru.html">BEM</a> , periodically <a href="http://video.yandex.ua/users/andrei-nickolaewitch/collection/1/">carrying</a> this knowledge to the world.  A year ago, they published an entertaining article about creating <a href="">an ideal office for developing software</a> , I recommend reading. <br><br><br>
<h3>  Ilya Kantor </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d20/2b9/5e9/d202b95e940fd97f8cd00a4e2bcad15b.jpg"><br>  Personal website: <a href="http://javascript.ru/">javascript.ru</a> <br>  Ilya has been involved with JS for more than eight years and is one of the most famous javascript developers and speakers in the post-Soviet space. <br>  The creator of <a href="http://algolist.manual.ru/">algolist.manual.ru</a> and <a href="http://javascript.ru/">javascript.ru</a> is also seen in improving the generator of ANTLR parsers, patches and contributions to PostgreSQL, index structures, services on Oracle, Varnish, Redis, etc. <br>  In addition, Ilya participated in the development of the Dojo Toolkit framework and contributed to other projects.  Some are even fairly well known, such as the Google Closure Compiler and jQuery. <br>  Also, he is active in creating <a href="http://javascript.ru/courses">courses</a> and conducting JavaScript <a href="http://javascript.ru/mk">workshops</a> . <br>  He defended his thesis at the Moscow State University on the subject of formal grammars and high-performance index structures for queries arising in complex search interfaces. <br>  For several years he taught mathematics for students and prepared for exams applicants. <br>  Interesting fact: his related profession is a translator from Chinese. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/141260/">https://habr.com/ru/post/141260/</a></p>
