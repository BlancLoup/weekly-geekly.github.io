No problem</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <b>Solution for ‚Äúsmart cities‚Äù from IBM will be used in Novosibirsk this winter</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bbf/136/86f/bbf13686f54c4f67b85a7576f75d2fce.jpg"><br><br>  ‚ÄúPrepare a sleigh in the summer, and a cart in the winter‚Äù - the wisdom of this saying cannot be underestimated.  Despite the prevalence and respectable age of the sentence, many heads of public utilities in various countries are unfamiliar with it.  Rainstorm and hurricane wind in summer?  Strange incident.  Snow drifts in the winter?  Surprise and almost a catastrophe.  Of course, this is not the case in all cities, which is good news.  In addition, the weather sometimes makes really unexpected surprises, which are difficult to predict, if at all possible, using traditional weather forecasters.

      In this case, come to the aid of the latest technology.  For example, the system <a href="http://www-03.ibm.com/software/products/ru/intelligent-operations-center">Intelligent Operations Center for Smarter Cities</a> (IOC).  Our company has developed it to help cities become smart systems that use smart solutions.  Now Novosibirsk has started working with the IOC platform.  In this city, the development of an intellectual system of snow removal is in full swing - the city administration plans to use it next winter. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Ruslan Permyakov, director of the competence center at Novosibirsk State University (NSU), believes that it is necessary to prepare for snowdrifts on the roads in advance.  Problems on the roads have always been and will be, and the more carefully plan the solution to such problems, the smoother the implementation of the solution.  ‚ÄúWe collect monitoring data on traffic jams from Novosibirsk providers, information from the hydrometeorological center and the GLONASS system, which is equipped with the rolling stock of snow blowers, then we process on the IBM IOC system and build models,‚Äù said Ruslan Permyakov about the features of the product.  Information on the progress of snow removal will be provided in real-time mode to the city authorities. <br><br>  At the moment, the snow plow control system has gone through the first two stages.  This is the creation of the application architecture and storage system.  A new stage will be the development of the application with its launch into operation.  In December, a pilot project will be summed up with the transfer of the application to a partner who is ready to catch the initiative. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/939/c99/2f3/939c992f303d4f9da1c93a91d6df097e.png"><br><br>  Key Intelligent Operations Center for Smarter Cities <br>  ‚Ä¢ Tracking of resources, events, incidents and their management based on a complete picture of the situation. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Optimization of the development and life of the city through in-depth analysis of urban infrastructure and resources <br>  ‚Ä¢ Communication with residents of the city and meeting their needs with the help of tools and services designed to work together citizens <br>  ‚Ä¢ Protection of citizens from criminals by analyzing and identifying areas with increased crime <br>  ‚Ä¢ Integration of data from different departments and institutions into a single platform <br><br>  The IOC system is designed to assist city administrations in managing complex urban infrastructures.  With the help of the platform, the administration more effectively controls incidents and emergencies.  The platform itself offers integrated data visualization tools, as well as tools for quick communication and in-depth analysis of the problem.  There are integrated maps, dashboards, customizable reports and a range of analytical algorithms. <br><br>  Our company since 2010 provides assistance to cities in solving complex problems.  For this we have developed a project <a href="http://smartercitieschallenge.org/">Smarter Cities Challenge</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/09e/b71/b1c/09eb71b1cefc4a36add57b01f3048d95.png"><br><br>  The Smarter Cities Challenge program has already helped many cities, among which the following projects should be highlighted: <br>  ‚Ä¢ Singapore - <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/ibm/blog/265737/">assistance with the optimization of maritime traffic</a> for one of the largest ports in the world <br>  ‚Ä¢ Glasgow (UK) subsidizes senior citizens with low incomes for heating costs.  The city also secured additional funding in the amount of $ 40 million from the State Strategy Technology Council Board of Government of the United Kingdom <br>  ‚Ä¢ Jacksonville (Florida, USA) opened a public resource, implemented as a dashboard that displays urban performance indicators and achievements in economic and social development, including city building permits issued, jobs created, benefits for veterans, and more.  This project was praised by the United States Institute for Social Technology (Public Technology Institute). <br>  ‚Ä¢ Johannesburg (South Africa) implemented a comprehensive technology solution for public safety and emergency management <br>  ‚Ä¢ Nanjing (China) implemented a program using social media, which helped attract over 2 million people to participate in the 2014 Youth Olympic Games as volunteers <br>  ‚Ä¢ Porto Alegre (Brazil) introduced the Digital PoA online platform that facilitates digital interaction between citizens, city authorities, communities and local organizations <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/caf/764/9ea/caf7649eae094fd697274aa1e3892420.jpg"><br><br>  Snow removal is not the most difficult, but a very high priority problem for Novosibirsk, so the developers decided to take it up. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/395783/">https://habr.com/ru/post/395783/</a></p>
