From Zero to Billion: History of Creating an Outstanding Company First-Hand. " <br><br>  Already there was a review on Habr√©, but after reading the review I did not see the inspiration that I felt after reading the book.  In a sense, the book for me, which is 5 years in business, in electronic commerce, with clear goals in front of itself, became a revelation and support where it was needed.  I saw a very similar to my moral and moral struggle Tony Neck in his company. <br><br>  Therefore, I decided to post my review, which may cause a stronger ‚ÄúWOW-feeling‚Äù to the reader.

    <h4>  Impression </h4><br>  From the first lines I missed reading the first steps of Tony in entrepreneurship: a farm for a divorce of worms, icons with prints, a newspaper, a set for magic tricks.  Following this, I began to get annoyed with my biographical account and tell the lives of young Tony and his failures or successes, interspersed with stories about his personal life.  But then I just swallowed page after page and could not stop, so exciting was Tony‚Äôs biographical story about his successes and failures, and the way he built his business for a billion. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  For whom the book </h4><br>  All entrepreneurs, owners and managers of large companies.  Everyone who is worried about building a corporate culture and a successful brand. <br><br>  Especially: the owner of online stores <br><br>  What is this book about: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ About startup mistakes <br>  ‚Ä¢ On building a corporate culture <br>  ‚Ä¢ About the highest brand and company values <br>  ‚Ä¢ About the right choice of market for the company <br>  ‚Ä¢ On the long-term planning and development of the company <br>  ‚Ä¢ About happiness <br><br><h4>  The main provisions of the book </h4><br>  Some points that I considered essential in the book. <br><br><h5>  For startups </h5><br>  In the first chapters, Tony very vividly and vividly describes many of his mistakes and ideas that helped create a startup Microsoft bought for 265 million.  How to choose the market for development, how to start playing on the market, about a long-term strategy.  And why in the end the project in which he invested his soul became a disappointment for him. <br><br><h5>  On building a brand and creating a corporate culture </h5><br>  Before reading this book, I heard and read a lot about corporate culture, but it seemed to me to be a kind of "spherical horse in a vacuum," I still did not understand what it is and why it is needed?  A certain set of rules that the whole company follows? <br><br>  After reading about Zappos, I realized that the corporate culture is the values ‚Äã‚Äãby which the company lives and each employee of the company - at work, in the family, in people.  By living with these values, each employee creates a Zappos brand.  Yes, that's right - the company's brand and corporate culture are one and the same. <br><br>  The only book that gave a bright and clear concept of the relationship of corporate culture and brand. <br><br><h5>  On attracting customers </h5><br>  "We spent a lot of money on the road advertising called" gaining market share. "  This is a great strategy - if your goal is to make as much money as possible in the shortest possible time. ‚Äù  At the same time Zappos reached a turnover of one billion dollars.  What did he do?  He delivered happiness! <br><br><h5>  About the correct business vision </h5><br>  What is the relationship between poker and business?  Understanding these rules of the game leads to victory in the long term.  Generally accepted errors (amateurish rules) can only bring temporary gain, but only those who play can best win. <br><br>  For me, the head of "poker" was a great revelation, which opened her eyes to the correct vision of the business. <br><br><h5>  Oh happiness </h5><br>  Thanks to the book, I picked up a pen and wondered what I really want to achieve in the end?  Happiness  What for?  To enjoy life, which I love so much, to give happiness to all my close and dear people.  Make them and yourself and the world better.  What for?  Because everything is interconnected.  By doing happier than others, you rejoice with them, in turn, these people give their happiness to you and yourself.  I make the world around me better, you make yourself better, because  you live in this world and everything that you do will invariably return to you. <br><br>  Here is the conclusion I made for myself.  And what conclusion do you make for yourself? <br><br><h5>  Online shopping </h5><br>  The whole essence of interest in the book on the part of the owner or manager of an online store fits in a few words: ‚ÄúHow has the online store reached billions in revenue over 10 years?‚Äù  In detail, lively and fascinating. <br><br><h4>  Emotions :) </h4><br>  What I learned about Zappos gave me a ‚ÄúWOW‚Äù feeling.  Inspired, intrigued.  After reading, I became a committed Zappos customer, although I haven‚Äôt made a single purchase yet.  And this is exactly what Zappos wants from every client.  A company focused on real values, promoting them not in word, but in deed. <br><br>  Do you create a ‚ÄúWOW‚Äù feeling for your customers?  Do you want to know how Zappos did it, having reached a billion dollars in 10 years? <br><br>  Then be sure, right now take a book in your hand, a pen for notes and start reading! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/111737/">https://habr.com/ru/post/111737/</a></p>
