      *** <br><br>  <b>Bloggers get caught</b> <br><br>  Criticism of the authorities may be expensive for the opposition part of the Internet community. <br><br>  In early October, the State Duma will sum up the law enforcement practice of the law on libel adopted in spring.  United Russia, as NG has learned, is ready to make amendments to punish anonymous critics of the authorities on the Web.  In Fair Russia, according to the newspaper, they are also working on this issue, preparing to take an active part in the discussion of the problem.  Experts doubt the feasibility of the initiative. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In the Kremlin, according to NG, a source close to the presidential administration is concerned about the spread of harsh but unproved criticism of the authorities on the Web.  According to the source, journalists of this kind allow themselves such statements, which are forced to adhere to the law on the pages of their media, and the boundaries go beyond the boundaries on the Internet: ‚ÄúThe outdated media law does not prescribe norms regulating the behavior of the press on the Web.  And there are many violations on her part. ‚Äù <br><br>  Meanwhile, in the Duma, NG correspondent was informed that the issue is broader.  According to the vice-speaker of the State Duma and a member of the lower house committee on culture, Sergei Zheleznyak, ‚Äúnow everything is clear with the media‚Äù: ‚ÄúThe law already provides for corresponding responsibility for journalists, both for publications and for authors.  But what to do if some anonymous user allows offensive statements?  In this direction, we will consider issues related to the improvement of legislation, so that anonymity does not create the illusion of impunity for such people. ‚Äù  The NG interviewer stressed that the issue will be resolved ‚Äúthrough the introduction of amendments to the legislation, which will allow to establish the identity of those who, under the guise of anonymity, commit crimes on the Web.  This is a very serious job, it does not apply to the media - it refers to the Internet. ‚Äù <br><br>  It is necessary to analyze the law enforcement practice of the new law, says Sergey Zheleznyak.  The work will be completed in a month, and then there will be specific proposals for editing the legislation in this direction, the vice-speaker explained: ‚ÄúIf a citizen calls a particular party or a specific person, then he can be charged.  For example, if he mentions a ‚Äúparty of crooks and thieves,‚Äù and says what structure he has in mind.  The Internet should not remain a zone of lawlessness.  We are now doing just that work. ‚Äù <br><br>  State Duma deputy from ‚ÄúFair Russia‚Äù, the first deputy chairman of the State Duma Committee on Constitutional Legislation and State Construction Alexander Ageev told NG: ‚ÄúWe have always supported everything that concerns extremism.  And we will also support the discussion in the Duma of these issues.  If extremist statements and statements continue to appear on the Internet, they will be equal to statements in the media, that is, to propaganda. ‚Äù  In the autumn of "Fair Russia", said "NG" Ageev, will take part in the development of the relevant amendment to the law on the media, and "the relevant committee is ready to discuss this initiative and support it." <br><br>  Not only the Duma, but also the Federation Council is concerned about these problems.  In October last year, the commission of the Federation Council on the development of civil society approved a bill against extremism on the Internet.  The document provides a norm according to which any statements of an extremist nature on the Web will be considered public and will result in punishment of up to five years in prison ‚Äî just like similar appeals in the media. <br><br>  In the Communist Party of the Russian Federation, as it turned out, they are informed about the intention of United Russia to initiate amendments to the legislation regarding statements on the Internet. <br><br>  Party lawyer, deputy chairman of the State Duma Committee on Constitutional Legislation and State Construction, Vadim Solovyov told NG that in the spring of the ruling party there was lively talk about ‚Äútaking control of the Internet and introducing criminal liability for critics of the ruling party‚Äù: especially relevant, then the laws will be adopted, toughening the responsibility for harsh statements of citizens on the web.  I think that United Russia will adopt a very tough amendment, although in principle it contradicts the approach of the European Court and the European Parliament to these issues. ‚Äù <br><br>  The NG interviewer recalls that in the West, criticism of the authorities is a hallmark of a democratic society: ‚ÄúWhen both the media and individual citizens monitor the work of the authorities and subject their actions to a comprehensive discussion, even if they overdo something (if it isn‚Äôt personal insults), such efforts are accepted by the community.  Because it is interested in tight control over the current government and current politicians. ‚Äù <br><br>  Attempts to regulate the Internet space, Alexey Mukhin, general director of the Center for Political Information, stressed in a conversation with NG, are too complex technically: ‚ÄúTherefore, Kremlin initiatives in this direction are pedagogically scary.  The authorities want to bring down the wave of political activity on the web.  To say to the opposition: they say, you will talk a lot - ‚Äúturn off the gas‚Äù, as in the famous Soviet film ... ‚Äù <br><br>  In the Duma, the expert believes, they are well aware that this initiative will cause serious opposition from both the media and external observers: ‚ÄúDeputies and the Kremlin should think about how to throw out the baby with water.  You can easily create a negative image for yourself by positioning Russia as a country that is stifling the Internet following the example of China or North Korea.  Therefore, the president is unlikely to embark on such initiatives.  Rather, it is a warning shot. ‚Äù <br><br>  Mukhin recalls that elections in the regions are coming in the fall: ‚ÄúIt is convenient, but not very feasible and very expensive to regulate the Internet.  Most of the tools of the Network are beyond the competence of Russian law enforcement agencies.  The initiative of the State Duma can work against the government - after all, United Russia itself often and actively use networks to present their ideas. ‚Äù <br><br>  <b>Independent newspaper</b> <br>  <a href="http://www.ng.ru/politics/2012-08-29/1_bloggers.html">Original</a> <br><br>  PS I apologize in advance for copy-paste, but I got mad, honest!
