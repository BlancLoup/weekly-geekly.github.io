  <section class="page js-page"><h1>There was such a profession: "Programmer"</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><h4>  Introduction </h4><br>  Not many people think about who programmers are.  It seems in the modern information society without them anywhere.  But who are they?  There are an uncountable number of stereotypes, many words are written that they are the same people as everyone else.  I propose to look at this issue in the light of the rapidly growing information technology industry. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  About knowledge </h4><br>  It is known that the level of knowledge of the basic sciences of modern programmers is rapidly <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/java/122665/">decreasing</a> .  There are new languages, technologies, tools and approaches that allow you to create a completely tolerable product <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/study/37217/">without special knowledge</a> .  This product will meet all the necessary needs of users, and after that it will be thrown out, because new languages, technologies and tools will appear. <br><br><h4>  Technical writers </h4><br>  To more accurately describe the topic of the article, I will talk about <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A2%25D0%25B5%25D1%2585%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D1%2587%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9_%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C">technical writers</a> .

      Technical writer, a specialist involved in documenting the solution of technical problems.  It was necessary to observe the work of technical writers.  They created not just mountains of documents on some product, they filled entire rooms with them.  And all the documents were drawn up clearly according to the appropriate GOST or other regulatory document.  They perfectly understood them and were guided.  Phrases were chosen as clearly as possible.  The language was used exclusively technical, not allowing free interpretations. <br><br>  Nothing like?  The programmer does the same.  Uses some technical language, clearly builds the document.  The document must meet certain technical requirements.  The programmer is well versed in the written code. <br><br>  In essence, a programmer and a technical writer are one and the same profession.  Specialization is different.  There are 1C programmers, C ++ ..., there are technical writers (GOST, ISO, etc.).  The requirements, work style, deadlines and process are almost the same. <br><br><h4>  Requirements, requirements, requirements ... </h4><br>  It turns out that at all stages of product creation, requirements are specified.  At the very beginning, the customer says: ‚ÄúI want ... (insert my own: program, product, brand, money)‚Äù.  In fact, at this stage there already exists an entity on which many more funds, time and nerves will be spent.  Then begins the long process of clarifying the requirements, which in their embodiment and create a product. <br><br>  After the customer wishes: ‚ÄúI want a program‚Äù.  All sorts of specialists, ranging from managers, ending with administrators, clarify technical requirements.  Requirements are becoming more accurate and accurate, the final condition of the requirements is the product, because only the product can satisfy all the requirements for itself. <br><br><h4>  Conveyor development </h4><br>  Why are there no more programmers?  Because Ford at one time came up with a <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A4%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25B4,_%25D0%2593%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8">conveyor belt</a> .  Modern software development cycle is a pipeline.  Programmers, architects, designers, managers, administrators, technical writers, testers occupy clearly marked places on the software path, perform some small action (clarify the requirement) and send it further.  All this is one profession, with small elements of specialization.  I think many will be able to recall a few good examples when a specialist from one area moved into another. <br><br><h4>  findings </h4><br>  If you stick to this view of the modern software industry, then it becomes clear that programmers (or hackers, as they like to call them in the west) disappeared immediately after its appearance.  A modern programmer is more of a conveyor worker with some degree of freedom or a technical writer.  It only clarifies the requirements to a certain level, bringing them closer to the final product. <br><br>  In this case, the fate of software development becomes clearer, when programs will be created without the participation of programmers.  This means that a person may ask a certain system to create a ‚Äúprogram‚Äù and it will give him the result after several clarifying questions.  So far this sounds like a fantasy, because to clarify the requirements leading to the final product, something more is needed than a simple enumeration of options into many steps and adaptation through training. <br><br>  PS Colleagues, do not be surprised, but I am also a techie.  I'm currently working as a java-developer. <br>  You should not take any opinion or thought that does not agree with your ideals as a personal insult.  The purpose of the article is to discuss aspects of the future of information technology and, in particular, software development.  And do not hurt everyone together and individually.  Comment constructively. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/285040/">https://habr.com/ru/post/285040/</a></p>
