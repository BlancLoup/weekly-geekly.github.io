  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Errors in conversational English that can (and should) be allowed</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Fluent and lively speech differs from literary phonetic, lexical and grammatical nuances.  At the same time, it remains the best means of informal communication along with Shakespeare's fanciful language. <br><br>  Today we will tell you which words and phrases can be simplified and which rules can be broken in spoken English without losing meaning. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Condensed Greetings and Appeals </h3><br>  The joy of meeting and the sadness of separation can be expressed very briefly: “Hi!  Hey!  Bye! ”  A rare Englishman will listen in a conversation with a friend prim "Good afternoon!".  Other greetings befell the same: the classic and worn out “Hello, how are you?” Can be varied with the phrase “Wassup?” (From “What's up?”, Which translates as our “Che as?” Or “How is it?”) . <br><br>  The conversation is always interactive.  And only the participants in the dialogue can regulate the degree of "contraction" of speech within the limits of permissible and at the same time non-improper.  For example, a nice abbreviation “sis” from “sister” (sister) when addressing the female sex does not cause any complaints, like the well-known even in our slang “bro” (from “brother” - brother).  The words guys, mom, dude, honey will be valid for spoken English.

    <h3>  Simplify Questions and Suggestions </h3><br>  When time is money, then there should be few words for the expression of thoughts.  Complete forms of basic questions in a conversation are replaced by simplified and more concise ones.  Compare the official: <br><br>  <i>"Would you like to join me for dinner?"</i> <br><br>  and simple option <br><br>  <i>"Wanna grab a bite to eat?"</i> , <br><br>  which essentially means the same thing: let's go for a snack.  Or such a frequent question <br><br>  <i>"What do you want to do now?"</i> <br><br>  replace with <br><br>  <i>"What do you wanna do now?"</i> <br><br>  Due to the speed of communication, the volume of the entire sentence is reduced: instead of the grammatically correct but long “You should better go out”, “You better go” or bold “Go out!” Appears.  Even auxiliary verbs disappear somewhere.  Perfect Tenses, which have been studied far and wide, are beginning to “suffer”: <br><br>  <i>"Did you go meet Denis with Nick?"</i> <br><br>  Whereas it would be more correct to: <br><br>  <i>"Have you met Denis with Nick?"</i> . <br><br>  Also in the language of communication appear and so-called "ellipses" ("Feeling okay?" Instead of "Do you feel ok?", "Doesn't matter!" Instead of "It does not really matter").  The following syntactically “truncated”, but correct from the position of language, sentences are also acceptable: “Have you finished your test yet?” Changed to “Finished your test?”. <br><br><h3>  Abbreviations of words and phrases </h3><br>  Relaxed pronunciation often resembles the chewing of potatoes, and the appearance of cuts in the dialogue is inevitable.  These are the so-called reductions: gotta (got to), wanna (want to), gonna (going to) and a hundred others.  From the most frequently used you heard in the dialogues, films and songs the following: <br><br>  • gimme = give me <br>  • lemme = let me <br>  • em ('em) = them <br>  • 'coz = because <br>  • d'jever (jever) = did you ever <br>  • -in '= ing <br>  • dunno = don't know <br>  • gotcha = got you <br>  • kinda = kind of <br><br>  Sometimes abbreviations practically merge several words: “Whatser name?” (“What is her name?”) When you are interested in the name of a girl and “Whaddyasay?” (“What did you say?”), When it is important to know what reported by your friend. <br><br>  The verbal economy with a general understanding of the context occurs when the two speak about something clear to them.  We respect each other’s time and do not repeat: for example, one can hear substitute forms (“one” instead of a pronoun) or instead of a verbal link - a short “do it / that”. <br><br><h3>  Change word order </h3><br>  A common mistake of Russians is the excellent luggage of English vocabulary, which they line up in the sentence according to the Russian rules of grammar, which is not true.  Another question is if in colloquial speech, for simplicity, the word order changes and the error is not made.  Coldplay chanting <i>“Turn your magic on, to me she'd say”</i> - and they are essentially right!  Although, if the song had been written by a literary critic, he would have taken as the basis for <i>“my magic on”</i> .  Bulky and not rhyme. <br><br>  Similar changes have undergone and proposals with disrupted interrogative "dislocation": <br><br>  <i>“I’ve been my cooking?”</i> <i><br></i>  <i>"Oh Dave in the living room, is that where he is?"</i> <br>  or <i>"Cos they get money brothers?"</i> <br><br>  Also, a frequent occurrence in conversational English began to begin sentences with but, whereas usually only part of the previous one began with it. <br><br><h3>  Expression of emotions </h3><br>  Remember the school jagged patterns “That's a pity” and “It's a shame”?  Instead, modern nouveau uses the popular cry “It sucks”.  These words will make an impression when others are powerless.  “I've lost our passports” can be said in case of inconsolable loss of passports.  Get ready to hear the response "Oh, it sucks!" (I'm sorry, how terrible, this sucks - underline). <br><br>  The same applies to the expression of enthusiastic emotions: if you do not want to waste time on uttering the full sentence, simplify it to "Yeah, awesome!", And everyone will appreciate your unbridled joy.  Other emodzhi can join here: yippee, ha, wow, ah, oh, (wh) oops. <br><br><h3>  Interjections and clichés for bundles </h3><br>  Sometimes, when your interlocutor is confused for a moment and selects words for his next thought, we can hear from him a kind of “silencers”.  These are well-known and practically meaningless cords (clichés, interjections, phrases and sounds that resemble lowing), which are also quite acceptable in speech: <br><br>  • I guess, lemme see, um, huh, well, uh, like, anyway - instead of silence; <br>  • wow!  - instead of verbose delight; <br>  • oops, my gosh - something sudden; <br>  • yuck - something disgusting; <br>  • I mean - I want to tell you what I have just said; <br>  • you know?  get it / me?  - Do you understand me?; <br>  • yeah, right!  - when you do not believe, but with sarcasm you demonstrate the opposite. <br><br><h3>  Vernacular </h3><br>  The morphology is simplified to the impossible: y'all = you all, ain't = am / are / do / did not, innit?  = is not it? .. And here also a triple negative is added: <i>“They ain't never given me no problems”</i> . <br><br>  The common syntax in morphology is also associated with syntax, so we get the following: “My legs are hurtin”, when the “g” that is so familiar to us at the end of infinitives disappears. <br><br><h3>  Who likes to study online </h3><br>  We offer to learn English in <a href="https://puzzle-english.com/%3Fpes%3Dgeektimes_simple">Puzzle English</a> for free (with restrictions).
