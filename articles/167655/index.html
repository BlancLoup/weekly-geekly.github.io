It is time to touch on no less important, and in fact - one of the key product categories for Samsung - TVs.  Fortunately, we have something to tell. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/8e4/9ab/285/8e49ab2858a02a84059435b1a88b6da3.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Regardless of the type of new Smart TV, be it LED, OLED or new UHD (ultra high definition TVs), the new 2013 Samsung TVs are designed to become a real home entertainment center - simple, convenient and exciting like never before.  Focusing on increasing consumer preferences in the segment of widescreen TVs, Samsung has released a number of models with a diagonal of over 60 inches, and in addition to it is also the world's largest serial premium ultra-high-definition television (resolution - 3840x2160) with a screen diagonal of 110 inches.

    <h4>  Key technical innovations on Samsung 2013 TVs </h4><br>  <b>Search and recommendation service S-recommendation.</b> <br>  Provides fast and convenient search for various content based on browsing history and user rating.  The search engine S-Recommendation analyzes various services and content repositories, including television broadcasts, applications, video on demand, social networks, as well as content hosted on connected devices. <br><br>  <b>Improved Smart Interaction.</b> <br>  Allow you to use simple gestures and everyday speech to control the functions of the TV. <br><br>  <b>Completely redesigned interface Samsung Smart Hub.</b> <br>  From now on, the Samsung Smart Hub interface consists of five dynamic screens that represent the following categories of content: <br><br><ul><li>  <b>TV</b> - the current television channel, as well as information about relevant personal recommendations of TV channels and programs based on user interests and habits. </li><li>  <b>Movies and television shows</b> - easy access to movies, TV shows and other content from various providers.  The section also contains recommendations based on user interests and habits. </li><li>  <b>Photos, videos and music</b> - a custom collection of personal content on Samsung Smart TV and other connected devices. </li><li>  <b>Social services</b> - a selection of user-generated content from friends and family members, popular videos from Facebook and YouTube, as well as video calling services. </li><li>  <b>Applications</b> ‚Äî <b>Applications</b> downloaded from the Samsung Apps store that provide access to new applications. </li></ul><br>  <b>Improved data transfer and interaction between devices.</b> <br>  Samsung Smart View technology gives users the ability to copy multimedia files from one device to another in real time.  AllShare technology allows you to connect various digital devices to your TV wirelessly, making it an intelligent and automated home media content center.  In addition, users of new TVs will be able to transmit the screen image to compatible mobile devices from the GALAXY family - tablets and smartphones. <br><br>  <b>A set of hardware updates Smart Evolution Kit.</b> <br>  The Evolution Kit hardware upgrade will allow consumers to implement new Smart TV features on their Samsung TV without having to buy a new TV. <br><br><h4>  New line of Samsung TVs 2013 </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d4b/364/dc1/d4b364dc10051ed65ad3a7455e24c1ae.jpg"><br><br>  One of the most striking new products was undoubtedly the curved <b>Samsung OLED TV</b> , which has a diagonal of 55 inches and a resolution of 1080p.  It creates an exciting panorama and immersive picture effect, especially when viewing scenes with wildlife landscapes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/255/6af/180/2556af1805874ecd5b10fd59ca4e6c67.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  It is implied that viewing visual content on an arc-shaped OLED TV will be as comfortable as possible for the eyes, since, due to the curved shape of the panel, the same distance between the user's eyes and the TV screen is provided from almost any angle. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5e1/121/b7f/5e1121b7f91a45d6ee619c505268eb82.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Samsung UHD S9</b> is an ultra-high definition television equipped with proprietary upscaling technology and capable of converting content from HD or Full-HD format to UHD format.  Another technology from Samsung - Precision Black Pro allows you to display rich black and pure white colors on the S9 screen. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3c4/4c4/c1e/3c44c4c1ecde801c9688b2753b99f04f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Combining high contrast with Ultimate Dimming dimming technology, which uses hundreds of LED blocks and precise BLU control, the new Samsung TV delivers a clear and detailed picture that was not previously achievable on widescreen screens. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/53d/f03/4f8/53df034f89ca6af7280e3eff346472a7.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Another distinctive feature of the S9 is a 3-way 2.2-format audio system with a power of 120 watts: it will undoubtedly produce a wider frequency range than the speakers of a standard flat-panel TV.  For speed and performance of the S9 is responsible quad-core processor. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b4b/56f/95e/b4b56f95e64e88f1214885c41cdda6fc.png"><br><br>  The design of the <b>Samsung F9500</b> OLED TV <b>screen</b> is based on the technology of self-emitting RGB sub-pixels, eliminating the need for additional backlighting.  The F9500 is the first TV in the world with proprietary Multi-View technology, which enables personalization of content.  Using Multi-View, two users can simultaneously view completely different content on the same screen with the corresponding audio and the ability to control functions independently of each other.  This technology works in conjunction with special 3D-glasses, which are embedded in separate stereo speakers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/98e/e9a/557/98ee9a5577637e71c115b45901ca3455.jpg"><br><br>  The new model of plasma TV <b>Samsung F8500</b> in terms of brightness <b>easily</b> stands on a par with LED-TVs, eight times better than them in the display of black colors.  This was made possible thanks to improved image brightness characteristics, as well as the new Deep Black Algorithm algorithm and Real Black Pro II technology.  In addition, the F8500 is the first TV with support for HEVC-coded content.  This latest codec will provide the opportunity to work with the highest quality HD content that exists today. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/fc6/4c2/158/fc64c215806c404c134d1acf50970b9e.jpg"><br><br>  The design of the F8500 TV is an excellent example of modern technological art that can be a decoration for any room.  The thin frame is an elegant and complex structure, smoothly flowing into the base and creating a beautiful ripple effect in the lower part of the TV case.  The model will be available with a screen diagonal of 51, 60 and 64 inches. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d40/7a9/3ca/d407a93cacad7d683f82df0f7dc38b32.jpg"><br><br>  <b>The Samsung Smart TV F8000 Series is</b> also equipped with a quad-core processor.  These TVs have Micro Dimming Ultimate dimming technology that adds richness to black and white on the screen. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/772/a44/4c2/772a444c20e63dc2577ceaea0771087d.jpg"><br><br>  The line of this series in 2013 will include models with a screen diagonal of 46, 55, 60, 65 and 75 inches. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/743/aab/d76/743aabd76a1ff07b3db637ecb94feee8.jpg"><br><br>  <b>The F7500 model</b> is the perfect combination of design aesthetics and functionality.  The form, created from a single sheet of metal, looks monolithic and futuristic.  The spectacular image is supported by the ‚Äúdark titanium‚Äù color design, ultra-thin frame, harmonious lines in the case design and massive square-shaped stand. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d01/3e7/4eb/d013e74ebddba2094388c8aecbbdb2f3.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Attractive design complemented by decent filling, including a quad-core processor and Micro Dimming Pro technology, providing a contrast image with deep black undertones.  The line of the F7500 series in the current year will include models with screen sizes 46, 55 and 60 inches. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b7a/995/718/b7a99571807630e4604384b5349992a8.jpg"><br><br>  Each of the flagship Samsung Smart TV‚Äôs TVs supports Smart Evolution technology, which makes it possible to timely update the software and hardware components of the TV, providing support for the latest technologies and functions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a86/b32/ee8/a86b32ee8628e8b67471519a3a71737b.jpg"><br><br>  The <b>Evolution Kit</b> hardware upgrade <b>kit</b> will allow owners of Smart TV of 2012 model year to upgrade the Smart Hub interface, voice control and gesture control, as well as improve the TV hardware with a quad-core processor.  The flagship Smart TV 2013 model year is also equipped with a special slot for future Evolution Kit hardware upgrades. <br><br>  Summing up the review of Samsung's line of TVs, I would like to note that six of them won prestigious awards at CES 2013: the Samsung UHD S9 won the award for the most innovative product, CES Best of Innovation, while OLED-TV F9500 and the LED TVs Smart TV F8000 and F7500 became laureates of the award for the best design and engineering solution ‚ÄúCES Design and Engineering‚Äù. <br><br>  That's all for now: unfortunately, the exact prices for new TVs, as well as detailed specifications and specific launch dates for them on the Russian market have not yet been disclosed. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/167655/">https://habr.com/ru/post/167655/</a></p>
