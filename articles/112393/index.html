      All this costs money, and despite our full confidence that we know ‚Äúwhat is better‚Äù and ‚Äúhow to get it,‚Äù companies become corporations that with increasing success suck money out of our pockets. <br><br>  It is almost as fascinating as the predatory games of people who, in all seriousness, consider our pockets with you, to be ours.  And the money that we have with you in the future, they also consider their own.  Beautiful movie, shoot that for a long time. <br><br>  So when the Internet began to spread rumors that Google had offered $ 6 billion for Groupon, healthy realism asked: ‚ÄúWhy‚Äù?  Such a sum, for such a business, in the position of Google? <br>  The other day I found all the answers. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  And if they don‚Äôt take it, we‚Äôll turn off the gas! </h4><br>  Groupon is definitely an interesting startup.  The fact that he managed to achieve a lot in a short time and the fact that he figured out how to deliver the goods to the consumer.  Even the fact that he is preparing for the upcoming IPO. <br><br>  I think that his main problem is the motivational model of Arnold Schwarzenegger, which he himself adheres to as the CEO of a young company, Andrew Mason.  This means that he allows himself to do stupid things in the first half of his career, so that people subsequently do not expect anything special from him.  In the light of the ‚ÄúCEO of 2010‚Äù award he recently received, it sounds impressive. <br><br>  However, if Google offered such a fantastic amount for its idea and implementation, it was his position that prevented the merger. <br><br>  And the imminent launch of <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/google/112349/">Google Offers</a> , of course, does not seem to me an accident.  In fact, Google is much easier to build your amusement park, with blackjack, and you understand. <br><br>  Moreover, judging by the activity of the same Google, they were already engaged in a new project during negotiations with Groupon, hoping to eventually merge both teams. <br><br><h4>  Slipped, fell, lost consciousness, woke up - gypsum </h4><br>  And although at first glance it seems that the two companies with the letter G are going to compete in the same field, this is not so. <br><br>  The Groupon model is to get an interesting discount from a business for a product in exchange for a certain number of purchased offers.  And this is already considered infinitely valuable, because it solves the problem when local entrepreneurs cannot ‚Äúadvertise on the Internet.‚Äù <br><br>  The Google model in this business is to find a flood of fresh blood in its huge advertising business, at the same time making smart phones more ‚Äúsmart‚Äù, forcing the owner to offer interesting offers on the go, depending on location.  And for this it is worth fighting. <br><br>  Nevertheless, the most interesting for the latest company is the ability to integrate offers into existing advertising, software, gadgets.  This is a fantastic way to increase the audience, and thus profit, not only in search, but also in mobile advertising. <br><br>  I think you do not need to be any analyst in order to understand whose plans are cooler. <br>  And it is for this reason that Groupon is preparing for war. <br><br>  When a predator does not get what he wants, a business proposal - he will definitely show his teeth.  Google is a saber-toothed tiger, compared to the Groupon kitten, which will not cope with any unique idea, business model, accommodation or offer.  Just because there is no chance of being crushed. <br><br><h4>  As one of my friends said - the dead man - I knew too much </h4><br><br>  Maybe I am dramatizing.  Still, Groupon has an established audience, a settled business model, which, as they proved, works. <br><br>  But something tells me that there will be no lull. <br><br>  It is still unclear when Google‚Äôs service will finally be launched, but when this happens, it will immediately pass over to the floor of the corpus all the smaller clones in this market, simply because it‚Äôs Google. <br><br>  This means that it‚Äôs time for Groupon to gather strength and prepare for a fight. <br><br>  Using <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/">RWW</a> , <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</a> , <a href="http://www.wired.com/">Wired</a> , <a href="http://www.gizmodo.com/">Gizmodo</a> , <a href="http://www.arstechnica.com/">ArsTechnica</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/112393/">https://habr.com/ru/post/112393/</a></p>
