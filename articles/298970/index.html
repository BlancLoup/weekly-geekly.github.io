Despite the fact that there were few changes in the staff of the largest Russian IT companies and media resources, they attracted public attention. <br><br>  Someone took a step forward in their professional development.  Someone fell in the eyes of colleagues, moving to a "warm" place.  Someone left the company, as he did not have enough time to read rap, write video blog and other creative attempts. <br><br>  <i>Some</i> refused to work <i>with someone</i> , saving their principles from encroachment.  But some had the rare opportunity to save the world, using their superpowers on a larger scale.

More recently, the news of a personnel reshuffle, the ‚Äúshelf life‚Äù of which, however, has not yet expired, reached the general public.  The founder of the Sotmarket store, Vsevolod Fear, in the fall of 2015, <a href="https://roem.ru/25-02-2016/220038/strah2-e-commerce/">became the</a> director of e-commerce at the mobile operator Tele2.  The operator has <a href="https://megamozg.ru/post/20546">earned</a> in Moscow since October 22, 2015. <br><br>  ‚ÄúSotmarket‚Äù and its ‚Äúneighbors‚Äù in the holding (IQ One Holdings) - ‚ÄúYutinet‚Äù and E96 - on the contrary, in early 2015 they closed in Moscow and focused on the regions of Russia. <br><br>  2. Former Editor-in-Chief of Forbes Woman and Forbes Life, Julia Taratuta, from March 1, will take the position of development director in Snob.  About this Taratuta <a href="https://www.facebook.com/julia.taratuta/posts/10205768814048696">wrote</a> on Facebook: <br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúEverything is nice here - people are excellent, and the office, and the playground, and the river, and the name is not without a call.  I will try not to spoil anything, I hope that you will be without us in any way. ‚Äù </blockquote><br>  Taratuta left Forbes in December 2015, as she did not agree with the intervention of the redpolitik from her new CEO Natalia Gandurina.  Gandurina - General Director of AS Media Media, who bought Forbes in the fall of 2015. <br><br>  3. Daniel Trabun, a week ago <a href="https://roem.ru/17-02-2016/219524/kadry-trabun-afisha/">announced</a> his retirement from the post of chief editor of the magazine ‚ÄúAfisha‚Äù.  He now <a href="https://www.facebook.com/daniel.trbn/timeline/story%3Fut%3D32%26wstart%3D-2051193600%26wend%3D2147483647%26hash%3D10153229016211784%26pagefilter%3D3%26ustart%3D1">announced</a> on his Facebook page that he began working as digital director of Esquire magazine. <br><br>  ‚ÄúIn the next 730 days I will: make a cool media on the Internet, launch a paper magazine, record rap, organize an exhibition, develop a mobile application, launch a video blog,‚Äù he said about his plans after leaving the Poster. <br><br>  Daniel Trabun began his career in publishing The Village of Look At Media publishing house, then worked as editor-in-chief of Interview magazine website, in 2012 he returned to Look At Media as chief editor of lookatme.ru.  In June 2014 he became the chief editor of "Posters". <br><br>  4. Yulia Dyachenko, who held the position of commercial director of the online cinema ivi.ru, led the advisory service at imhonet.ru.  Dyachenko <a href="https://www.facebook.com/100000507478221/timeline/story%3Fut%3D32%26wstart%3D-2051193600%26wend%3D2147483647%26hash%3D1306951882665048%26pagefilter%3D3%26ustart%3D1">announced the</a> transition in her Facebook account: ‚ÄúThis [transition to imhonet.ru] is a serious step for me towards professional development‚Äù <br><br>  Imhonet.ru positions itself as a service that not only provides customers with access to movies, books and computer games, but recommends content based on the history of user preferences, past ratings and preferences of his friends. <br><br>  5. Gevorg Hakobyan <a href="https://roem.ru/15-02-2016/219282/akopyan-kak-ty-mog/">,</a> editor-in-chief of the ‚ÄúIgromania‚Äù publication, <a href="https://roem.ru/15-02-2016/219282/akopyan-kak-ty-mog/">resigns</a> and will be engaged in marketing at the Softklab publisher. <br><br>  ‚ÄúWhen, at the end of 2011, I was asked to write tiny material for a third-rate heading, I could not have imagined that I would end up on the staff of my favorite magazine, for which I ran impatiently to a stall.  I still don‚Äôt believe in what has become the editor-in-chief and editorial director, ‚Äùwrites Akopyan. <br><br>  Founder and Acting  Kanobu editor-in-chief Haji Makhtiyev commented on the situation: <br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúFor gaming media, it's a loss.  A young, with a bunch of ideas and energy, a man who undertook to shovel an old-school magazine and brand.  In fact, he had a chance to reload not only the brand, but the approach itself and become a model, an asterisk, for those who are still interested in making media about games / entertainment.  "Gambling" the benefit of such a chance was ready to give and did it. <br><br>  Shoveled more than a year and dumped into a "stable company", in a position "below average".  It was possible to become a frontman and a rocker, and chose sixth place in the third row.  The main thing is warm.  Hello, logic! ‚Äù </blockquote><br><h4>  And for dessert - news from abroad </h4><br>  Apple has hired Frederic Jacobs, one of the developers of the Signal messenger.  Former employee of the US National Security Agency Edward Snowden considers Signal the safest messenger. <br><br>  The proposal to cooperate coincided with the <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/271742/">confrontation between</a> Apple and the FBI, which requires to unlock the iPhone terrorist from San Bernardino, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2016/02/25/apple-hires-developer-behind-signal-edward-snowdens-favorite-secure-chat-app/">said</a> TechCrunch. <br><br>  On February 25, Jacobs <a href="https://twitter.com/FredericJacobs/status/702849838384340993">wrote</a> on his Twitter page that he accepted the offer from Apple and in the summer he will start working in the CoreOS division, which is responsible for protecting the company's devices. <br><br>  Jacobs worked for two years as an engineer at Open Whisper Systems (OWS), which developed the Signal messenger after combining two of its applications: TextSecure (protects against message interception) and RedPhone (from eavesdropping calls).  It was he who developed the message encryption system for the messenger version for iOS devices.  In January 2016, the developer left the company. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/298970/">https://habr.com/ru/post/298970/</a></p>
