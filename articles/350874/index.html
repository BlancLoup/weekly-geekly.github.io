  <section class="page js-page"><h1>When business grows: virtual numbers in DEF format</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Earlier we talked about the use of virtual numbers in DEF format with a cloudy IP PBX.  Emerging new business cases confirm that this simple scheme is highly demanded for various tasks, and the low cost of operation often determines the choice in its favor.  Today we would like to describe the successful experience of one of the companies operating in the market for sales of ready-made businesses and franchises. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/sl/ca/8g/slca8gyckykf4ozkvnhy9erfox0.jpeg" alt="image"></div><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Business expansion </h3><br>  The company provides services in the field of purchase and sale of ready-made businesses: shops, car washes, hotels, beauty salons, clinics.  Over time, business needs began to grow, it was necessary to expand our presence in the regions, reliable communications and accessibility to potential customers.  At some point, it became obvious to management that the volume of applications began to exceed the capacity of their telephone infrastructure.  Given that the company, of course, has other channels of communication.  Ultimately, providing the units responsible for processing requests and conducting transactions with the required number of low-cost multi-channel numbers and automation tools was valuable if it resulted in a decrease in the number of lost calls and accelerated the process of bringing the transaction to completion. <br><br><h3>  Buisness process </h3><br>  Brokers of the company receive orders for the sale / purchase of a business and directly through an incoming call.  However, a large number of preliminary applications come from the site, where a potential client can fill out a form without contacting the ‚Äúlive seller‚Äù, with a preliminary indication of the possible amount of investment, as well as from advertisements on various specialized resources, thus initiating a callback from the company.  The company's own call center works both in the mode of receiving calls and answering ringing according to the results of receiving inquiries and connects them with brokers for preliminary discussion of requirements and planning further actions.

    <h3>  Switching to a cloud PBX with additional professional solutions for a call center, integration with CRM and connecting multiple DEF numbers </h3><br>  The company introduces a cloud PBX into its business communications solutions and connects many DEF numbers to distribute them in ads at different sites and in different regions with the ability to track activity on them.  Since the numbers are multichannel, they expand the capacity of the system for handling calls.  For outgoing calls in the regions, such a number can be used for broadcasting AON if there is no office with a local landline number.  The advanced functionality of IP-PBX Zeon allows the call center manager to manage the queues of calls, reducing the waiting time for customers, automatically dialing to customers.  And the integration of telephony with existing CRM allows you to record the entire amount of information on the client, including call recordings, managing the process of conducting the transaction. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/04d/929/d06/04d929d061cdc9fb28995f31ae00e09f.jpg"><br><br><h3>  SMS alert </h3><br>  DEF numbers allow the call center to correct outgoing campaigns and call back at another time based on the received reverse automatic or manually sent SMS messages.  If the client is not ready to communicate, he can answer automatic SMS on his phone.  This simple service becomes available thanks to virtual numbers.  SMS come first to our SMS gateway, and then to the predefined e-mail address (s) in the form of e-mails. <br><br>  See what SMS they get: <br><br>  - This subscriber wants to contact you.  You can call him back by dialing 79181234567. With care of you, MTS. <br>  - This user is available again.  You can call him.  Beeline <br>  - This subscriber is available to call. <br>  - I can't answer on the way <br>  - Call me back, please. <br><br>  This makes it easier to find a customer.  There are very mobile customers who are hard to catch. <br><br>  <i>Well, do not forget that in many services, registration confirmation is done via SMS.</i>  <i>You can bind our DEF to any service (if there are no additional restrictions).</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ab9/9d7/2c6/ab99d72c60082b0d5003e71ba13bf995.jpg"><br><br><h3>  Opportunity to expand </h3><br>  Since DEF-numbers are distinguished by their affordability, the customer can quite easily solve the issues of the necessary expansion of the number base.  In a short time, the company has already twice ‚Äúreplenished‚Äù the required amount of numbers with the emergence of new resources for advertising. <br><br><h3>  Ability to use with FMC solution </h3><br>  For some of its employees, the company ordered IP-SIM cards for use in mobile phones.  Someone uses the card with the output of the public access network through the PBX and the common company number, in the same way they receive an incoming call, i.e.  to an internal number in a corporate PBX.  But for some brokers, a DEF number is set up on an IP-SIM card, which allows customers to call them directly.  In the latter case, the broker can also receive automatic SMS on your mobile phone about the client's employment or his willingness to talk. <br><br>  So, for a B2B company with a regional presence, a solution with a cloud PBX and virtual DEF numbers can be very effective due to: <br><br><ul><li>  low cost solutions; <br></li><li>  full integration with cloud services, such as CRM systems; <br></li><li>  the ability to reduce the time of the transaction due to the productive functions of PBX for call centers and the ability to process automatic incoming SMS messages. <br></li></ul><br>  You can right now pick up a virtual number on the website <a href="http://iptelefon.su/cases/number-landing">iptelefon.su</a> , as well as get acquainted with our <a href="http://www.iptelefon.su/promo/zeon">IP PBX Zeon</a> (there is a cloud version). <br><br>  Thanks for attention! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/350874/">https://habr.com/ru/post/350874/</a></p>
