A year ago, everyone started abruptly periscope, for five months they all started to set up "Prism", four months ago, everyone rushed to hunt for pokemons - noticed, by the way, was it a year of trends with the letter "P"?  Of course, it‚Äôs not over yet, but if you want to be on the next wave of popularity, create startups with the letter Q (or don‚Äôt create). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c5b/2c8/ff3/c5b2c8ff361c49608b8c10809b1541e4.jpg"><br>  <i>- Once again, Mr. Bond, megatrends is what is it?</i> <br><br>  For those who are working, being an advertiser or launching their project, should be guided in what is now fashionable in mobile and Internet users, this is a nightmare at all: if you are not oriented in what is gaining popularity now, you will hardly have time collect all the "cream" from "Periscope", "Prism" and "Pokemon". <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Professional activity requires a professional approach, while all attempts to analyze trends turn out to be extremely far from the actual analysis: trend-digests of advertising agencies and articles like ‚Äú10 trends of 2016 that cannot be missed‚Äù are collected completely unsystematically, by eye, because they are based on there is no methodology.  Without a systematic approach, this is simply a set of good wishes, from which it is difficult to squeeze practical benefits.

    <h2>  Why trend articles are useless </h2><br>  For example, let us examine one such <a href="http://adindex.ru/publication/opinion/marketing/2015/12/22/130969.phtml">article</a> on trends in Adindex, devoted to the trends of 2016 from the leading strategists and brand managers of the Russian market.  It lists: <br><br><ul><li>  Advertising customization </li><li>  Video blogger boom </li><li>  CRM </li><li>  Mobility </li><li>  Active use of the "force of the moment" </li><li>  mobile video viewing </li><li>  death mobile </li><li>  monetization of the audience of social networks and instant messengers </li><li>  big data </li><li>  ability to react flexibly to market changes </li><li>  focus on all Russian, domestic </li><li>  it's fast now </li><li>  internet things </li><li>  Multichannel </li></ul><br>  It is easy to notice that there are mixed phenomena of different nature: for example, real, but the old trend for mobility and video viewing is mixed with CRM, which are simply a type of specialized software, and Big Data, which simply means data sets.  Imagine that your director read this article and came to the office inspired in the morning: we need to apply Big Data in our business!  A familiar picture, yes?  And so on.  In fact, the trend here is only multi-channel (omni-channel) - i.e.  connection of all communication channels of communication with the client into one big bundle. <br><br>  In the <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/GrapeMedia/2014-30573828%3Fqid%3D8c9c125a-344c-4fa8-a54e-c7bd70829b81">presentation of</a> the Grape advertising agency for 2014, you can find the following set of trends: <br><br><ul><li>  Shopping from mobile devices </li><li>  Messengers </li><li>  Cryptography </li><li>  Internet of things </li><li>  Biometrics </li><li>  Digitalization </li></ul><br>  Cutting off Occam's razor, everything remains with the only real trend on the list: ‚ÄúDigitalization‚Äù.  The rest, again, is just a listing of the spread technologies. <br><br>  The author's project ‚Äú <a href="http://krasavchikbro.ru/prikolnye_podarki/trendsinpocket">Trends in Pocket</a> ‚Äù offers the very methodology spreading out work with trends into simple thinking techniques in the form of a set of cards, allowing to decompose the trends of recent years and apply them both to the existing business and when searching for ideas for your own project. <br><br><h2>  The power of methodology: how Pocket Trends work </h2><br>  ‚ÄúTrends in the pocket‚Äù of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/slava.shashkov">Vyacheslav Shashkov</a> is 58 cards divided by color into 13 megatrends - phenomena stretched over decades, which are determined by pronounced behavioral characteristics of consumers: <br><br><ol><li>  Megatrend: Local Love </li><li>  Megatrend: Ephemeral (Ephemeral) </li><li>  Megatrend: Human Brands </li><li>  Megatrend: Status Seekers </li><li>  Megatrend: Gamified (Playsumers) </li><li>  Megatrend: Post Demographic </li><li>  Megatrend: The Universe Around You (Youniverse) </li><li>  Megatrend: Helpfull </li><li>  Megatrend: Pricing Pandemonium </li><li>  Megatrend: New World Map (Remapped) </li><li>  Megatrend: Dependence on Information (Infolust) </li><li>  Megatrend: Self Development (Betterment) </li><li>  Megatrend: Joyning </li></ol><br>  And already inside each megatrend - from two to seven cards, which look like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/42f/ea6/606/42fea6606985840d89b058596bfa677f.jpg"><br><br>  Let us return to the article from Adindex, and look at it already with the help of our cards, for example, through the eyes of the owner of the insurance company: <br><br><blockquote>  The active use of the ‚Äúforce of the moment‚Äù is the maximum integration of the brand message into the context of the situation and environment in which the representative of the auditorium segment resides, when communication to him is most logical and will not cause irritation. </blockquote><br>  This is a megatrend Infolust (‚Äúdependence on information‚Äù), which includes the trend ‚ÄúThrough the lens‚Äù.  The parameter Key points on the card indicates that the essence of the trend is to get information in real time through the Periscope, Twitch and Snapchat tools, etc.  You can follow the QR-link for more information with remote assessment cases or product presentation video. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f79/92d/4bf/f7992d4bfad44d19a7a60abdf24016e8.png"></div><br>  Having become acquainted with them, the owner of the insurance company may decide to start the remote damage assessment service from the accident.  Agree on the spot or contact the insurance?  Your personal manager at Periscope will decide for you. <br><br><blockquote>  AdIndex: The next important communication tool is CRM. </blockquote><br>  CRM is a tool for solving a wide range of business problems.  But Insider Trading trend from Megatrend ‚ÄúSelf Development‚Äù (Betterment) contributes to the development of internal CRM solutions aimed at training, motivating and PR employees.  And this trend has really spread in 2016. <br><br>  While Uber and Yandex are struggling with striking taxi drivers, the GrabTaxi app on Southeast Asia has expanded the social security program for drivers.  From each trip, the driver‚Äôs fund is replenished with a cashback from the company for life insurance, income protection and crisis support.  Further benefits include English language lessons and educational scholarships. <br><br><blockquote>  AdIndex: Omnicanality as another trend implies the development of the brand ecosystem so that the user can easily find and get information about the product and brand of interest during the selection, after the purchase and after consumption.  We are talking about the availability of properly submitted information, the ability to make a purchase not only offline, but also online, and the opportunity if you want to share experiences using both the brand itself and friends and loved ones.  In other words, "this is a game according to the rules of the buyer." </blockquote><br>  This is a correctly designated trend, but what does this description give to those who want to put it into practice?  Turning to the cards, we will find one of the characteristics: "the ability to order in all channels."  And now an example from Domino's pizza <a href="https://anyware.dominos.com/">anyware.dominos.com</a> is revealing.  Now you can order food by telling Siri about this, by tweeting, sending emoji, using smart watches or Smart TV.  A startup can embed an idea into a business. <br><br><h2>  Create ideas for startups </h2><br>  "Trends in your pocket" are applicable not only for working businesses, but also for finding ideas for new projects.  Below are three new ideas for businesses, as an example, created on the basis of Trends in pocket: <br><br><ol><li>  Taking the trend "Uberization", apply it to the beauty industry.  The term ‚Äúuberization‚Äù refers to the use of computer platforms, such as mobile applications, to conduct peer-to-peer transactions between customers and service providers, often excluding traditional planning corporations from their activities.  For example, if young mothers who provide haircuts, manicure, weaving braids and consumers, will meet with the trend ‚Äúuberisation‚Äù - you can find the specialist you need in the next house. </li><li>  Or a card with the trend ‚ÄúKartomaniya‚Äù: what else can be placed on the map, having solved the problem of many consumers?  I immediately recall my friend, a big fan of Guinness beer, who constantly suffers from the search for the nearest bar where they pour him.  Are there lovers of craft beer or Belgian Blanche among you?  Great, create a map application where you can see which bars serve beer. </li><li> Use the Omnikanality trend mentioned above, and develop an application that finally combines notifications from all instant messengers into one (telegram, viber, facebook, mail) with the ability to sort.  It is impossible to constantly ride among all instant messengers, killing the phone's RAM! </li></ol><br>  And so on - using ‚Äú <a href="http://krasavchikbro.ru/prikolnye_podarki/trendsinpocket">Trends in your pocket</a> ‚Äù as a navigator for known trends, you may not create a new ‚ÄúGoogle‚Äù, but this methodology will help you find a not-occupied niche around you and open new opportunities for the development of an already working business. <br><br>  Of course, Trends does not solve all the problems of a growing or emerging business, but the systematic approach they offer will help filter information in the media space and wrap up new trends for their own benefit. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/313800/">https://habr.com/ru/post/313800/</a></p>
