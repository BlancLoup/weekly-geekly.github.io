In this article I want to talk about relatively new tools - <b>personalization services</b> , which recently began to actively develop in the Russian market.  Personalization services are designed to show each site visitor an individual offer - what he really needs is what will make him make a purchase here and now.  The main benefit of using these services is that with a relatively simple implementation (and sometimes a free test period), they quickly and significantly increase the conversion and profit of the online store. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Personalization of an online store</b> is the process of displaying different content or functionality, individual offers and opportunities to different visitors (segments of visitors), depending on their behavior and other information about them.

    <h3>  #one.  <a href="http://hucksterbot.ru/">HucksterBot</a> is a discount personalization service that sells to those users who usually don‚Äôt buy. </h3><br>  <b>Principle of operation:</b> <br>  The system collects data about visitors of the online store, analyzes the behavior and makes individual offers (discount on previously viewed products, free shipping, etc.) for different segments of users who are poorly converted into sales (coming from the regions, through any advertising channels and campaigns, etc.).  Segments and discounts on products and categories are configured in your account. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bab/6c5/d7e/bab6c5d7e0724d3e9725d922d6cf248d.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Cost:</b> <br>  There is a free period (30 days) during which you can evaluate the effectiveness of the product.  Paid rates are calculated based on the number of orders that the service provides.  For small stores (up to 10 orders through Hucksterbot per month) the service is free.  If the service brings up to 100 orders per month, then its cost will be 1900 rubles / month. <br><br>  <b>Successful implementation history:</b> <br>  ‚ÄúGarden Machines‚Äù is a retail network selling garden equipment, a market leader in St. Petersburg.  According to Google Analytics, the conversion in the regions where the network did not have offline stores was 6 times lower than in the home region.  The company decided to apply a new approach to increasing sales and test the hypothesis - the provision of personalized discounts to certain segments of visitors with low conversion (regional, coming to the site through advertising channels, mobile users) will increase the conversion and scale these channels.  The introduction of HucksterBot allowed to increase the gross profit from regional sales by 2.7 times and turnover 3 times.  The overall conversion of the online store increased by 60%.  <a href="http://blog.hucksterbot.ru/istoriya-snail-ru/">Read the detailed case</a> . <br><br><h3>  # 2.  <a href="http://www.personali.com/">Personali</a> is a discount personalization service that allows a buyer to bargain directly on the online store website </h3><br>  <b>Principle of operation:</b> <br>  The system analyzes the behavior of site visitors and involves them in the buying process - for example, by offering a potential customer to enter the price he is willing to pay for the product.  If the specified price suits the store, then the buyer pays for the goods as much as he indicated. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/584/5f3/53b/5845f353b8f84053a93013b48c0ca344.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Cost:</b> <br>  Personali just recently came to the Russian market and positions itself here as an Enterprise solution for large online stores.  Therefore, the cost of integration is relatively high and is calculated individually.  Possible pilot launch of the product. <br><br><blockquote>  ‚Äú <i>We have been testing the service for half a year already - the integration was completed in October 2015,</i> ‚Äù Leonid Dovladbegyan, First Deputy Director General of 220 Volt, told Kommersant <i>. positive effect on conversion and turnover.</i> " </blockquote><br><br><h3>  # 3.  <a href="http://retailrocket.ru/">RetailRocket</a> - personal product recommendations and email marketing personalization service </h3><br>  <b>The principle of product recommendations:</b> <br>  The system collects data on user behavior, then generates recommendations based on data analysis and product matrix.  Further, at certain moments, the service shows product recommendations (the most popular products in the store, search recommendations, similar products, etc.), thereby increasing the income of the online store due to an increase in conversion, average bill and the frequency of repeated purchases. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7e8/9cb/4e2/7e89cb4e2c6443b086807b39d5ae65ef.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Cost:</b> <br>  RetailRocket offers several tariffs with a monthly payment: from free for small online stores to Enterprise-solutions, the cost of which is calculated individually.  In addition, it is possible to pay by the CPO model (payments for each order made through a referral system). <br><br>  <b>Successful implementation history:</b> <br>  The effectiveness of the implementation of the system by the online store Allsoft.ru was determined by conducting A / B testing: the entire audience of the site was divided into equal segments.  One showed RetailRocket's product recommendations, the other showed their own recommendations for an online store platform.  The introduction of a new product recommendation system allowed the store to increase revenue by 17%.  <a href="http://retailrocket.ru/blog/keys-personalizatsii-internet-magazina-allsoft-ru-rost-vyiruchki-na-17/">Read the detailed case.</a> <br><br><h3>  #four.  <a href="http://triggmine.com/">TriggMine</a> - Email Marketing Automation and Personalization Service </h3><br>  <b>The principle of personalized email newsletters:</b> <br>  The system analyzes the actions of the online store visitors and leads them through the sales funnel with the help of personalized mailings.  Individual letters are formed in real-time mode, depending on at what stage of the funnel the user is ‚Äústuck‚Äù or depending on the action he performed.  Letters with a personal offer can be sent if the user has ‚Äúthrown‚Äù the basket, looked at a number of products and left the site, bought some goods and there is a possibility that he will buy related products, etc. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b61/d85/557/b61d85557e7d49cb9666247fc68f4dc6.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Cost:</b> <br>  TriggMine offers a 14-day trial period.  Fees depend on the number of unique site visitors per month.  The minimum fare is $ 300 / month, if the site has less than 100,000 unique visitors per month.  Enterprise solutions for very large stores are calculated individually. <br><br>  <b>Successful implementation history:</b> <br>  A large online store of seeds and seedlings for generating repeat purchases previously used only manual regular mailings.  The management decided to try adding more personal automatic letters, starting with working with abandoned baskets.  As a result, the company earned an additional 2.6 million rubles in 3 months.  On "Habr√©" <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/triggmine/blog/297698/">this case was published</a> at the beginning of the year. <br><br><h3>  Conclusion </h3><br>  Friends, you can find quite a lot of Russian-language services for online store personalization ("Crossss", "Personyze", "REES46", "NextClick", "AdMail", "DriveBack", etc.), most of them are recommendation services and they automate email mailings, but there are no cases (cases of successful sabotage) for all these services, so I did not include them in the review.  If you know any other personalization services that work on the Russian market and that have experience of successful implementation, I would be grateful if you tell about them in the comments, I‚Äôm happy to add material.  Thank! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/300826/">https://habr.com/ru/post/300826/</a></p>
