Today, you can also ask us any question, but instead of a list of employees there will be tears of happiness and joy that we have become millionaires.  We have you - a million of the best users! <br><br> <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/tm/blog/445940/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/90f/90e/0e1/90f90e0e13dcb622644e4cc36fda4d90.jpg"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Thousands of thousands </h2><br>  Yesterday, some users noticed a ‚Äúforeign body‚Äù in the Habr's tape - a picture from our SMM super-bishop: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9c8/c58/090/9c8c580903890d338c9fc1f61f19d090.jpg"><br><br>  What is a million?  The number with six zeros, first appeared five centuries ago.  If we talk about a million rubles, then in the modern world it is relatively little, barely enough for a new car of the budget class itself.  If a million dollars is a tangible amount that can solve most of the problems of many of us.

Today, there are only 348 cities in the world with a population of over 1 million, of which only 16 in Russia (can you name them from memory?). <br><br>  What about a million people, united by the same interests, gathered on one site, in conditions of closed [for a long time] registration?  These scales are hard to imagine (but even harder to imagine that 9 million go to Habr without an account). <br><br>  Surely you are interested in the name of "milionnik"?  They became the user <a href="https://habr.com/ru/users/giperoglif/" class="user_link">Giperoglif</a> - apparently, this is a girl from Vladivostok, but she still does not get in touch. <br><br>  Million of the best users, we love you!  :) <br><br><h2>  Donati.  Results </h2><br>  A month ago, we <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/tm/blog/441954/">launched a</a> user award for publication authors, or donations.  In the post-announcement, I suggested that everyone try to zadonat a couple of ruble, to find out how it all works. <br><br>  Summing up. <br><br>  There were 61 transfers in total (I remind you that I requested to make a test payment).  Most of them (53) fell on Yandex.Money - a total of 1704.35K.  17 translations for 1, 8 for 10 ‚ÇΩ, 5 for 50, 10 for 100 and 1 for 150.  In second place is PayPal: 7 transfers for 3561,59‚ÇΩ.  Paypal was the smallest payment (0.01‚ÇΩ) and the largest - 3141,59‚ÇΩ (from a user from Google).  At 3rd place - WebMoney, where there was 1 payment for 100‚ÇΩ.  In general, the figures are quite comparable with the <a href="">results of the survey</a> . <br><br>  <b>Total collected:</b> 1704.35 + 3561.59 + 100 = <b>5365.94‚ÇΩ</b> .  As much guaranteed to the author would bring the publication with a rating of +86 (as part of the <a href="https://habr.com/ru/info/help/posts/">PPA</a> ). <br><br>  In the post-announcement, I promised to spend all the money raised for charity.  In the comments, they offered to make a transfer to the ‚Äú <a href="https://podari-zhizn.ru/">Give Life</a> ‚Äù fund - they added a couple of ruble from themselves and sent: <br><br> <a href="http://s.assist.ru/e/sv0SxfBVT50GfGy"><img src="https://images.mindbox.ru/campaigns/233981/691910/3.jpg"></a> <br><br>  If you also received a salary today, you can also pay for a good deed. <br><br><hr><br><h2>  Refactoring Habr's mobile version and new features </h2><br>  Of the main innovations of March: added the <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/tm/blog/442208/">function of sending typos to the</a> authors of publications and a new section of the site - ‚Äú <a href="https://habr.com/ru/news/">News</a> ‚Äù.  If everything is clear with the first one, then the news <a href="https://habr.com/ru/news/t/444506/">appeared just yesterday</a> and I want to tell a little about them separately. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">News spoiler</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Habr was never a news resource and did not aspire to become one.  More precisely, how - the key news was not ignored, but, as a rule, they were not very operational (but large and detailed).  That is, we voluntarily and deliberately gave our competitors a huge amount of traffic and quoting, refusing to take small notes in favor of the Longrid publications. <br><br>  However, a recent survey of the audience showed that many users consider the lack of news to be Habr's problem and would like to see this format on the site.  We thought ... and decided to fix it.  As a result, it seems to us, everyone will benefit: <br><br><ul><li>  All news (that is, information that is relevant in a small time interval) is in a separate section and will not be lost among the "publications"; </li><li>  ‚ÄúPublications‚Äù will be slower to leave the main page, that is, they will get more user attention. </li></ul><br>  Selection of news in a separate section will allow to ‚Äúsurvive‚Äù the format consisting of a heading and a couple of paragraphs of the text, which was previously hard for ‚Äúlongrids‚Äù.  For the time being, this section is led by our editors, but soon we will add this feature to regular users (and if you are not impatient to try yourself as a newsman, then let me know in a personal).  In general, the functionality of the "news" is still rather in the form of a beta version - we have big plans for it, so have patience. <br></div></div><br>  And we also pretty well polirnuli mobile version, the main direction - more meaningful and rational work with data storage on the client.  The works were aimed at saving traffic (due to the maximum reuse of already downloaded content) and user resources.  A little more detail: <br><br><ul><li>  <abbr title="Server side rendering">SSR</abbr> now renders a complete page (including user data, such as personalized ribbon, avatars, settings, site language, etc.).  In practice, this means that the interface of the mobile version has become less "torn": now there will not be any jams, unnecessary redrawing (re-rendering) of pages and elements; </li><li>  Optimized the work of JS on the client side, minimized the number of requests to the server (we try to reuse as much as possible all the loaded data that we can); </li><li>  Reduced the size of the bundle and downloadable fonts - earlier, 380 KB in total were loaded, now it is about 250; </li><li>  They made ‚Äúskeletons‚Äù for publications - now the waiting for content download is not so heavy; </li><li>  Added "News": section and block in the tape; </li><li>  Enhanced the plate of the translated article; </li><li>  Fixed problems with redirects; </li><li>  Enhanced spoiler; </li><li>  Fixed minor bugs and added some new ones. </li></ul><br>  Now everything has to fly, try it.  A little later, we will refine the comments and other sections of the mobile version. <br><br>  And now - your questions. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/445940/">https://habr.com/ru/post/445940/</a></p>
