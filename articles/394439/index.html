In addition, this sensor can operate in extremely low temperatures due to intelligent frost protection, which allows the sensor to be maintained in working condition at temperatures from -40 to + 45 ¬∞ C. <br><br>  Doppler motion sensor <br>  Various technologies can be used to determine motion, but the microwave or so-called Doppler method is currently the most advanced and efficient. <br><br>  The microwave sensor is capable of: <br>  Identify or penetrate any non-metallic object or obstacle; <br>  Work in a dusty or dusty environment; <br>  In addition, an additional advantage of this sensor, I believe, is the minimum service life declared by the manufacturer - more than 100,000 hours: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1d4/416/3e7/1d44163e729abb3c536315ee3dc37d0f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  It would seem that not so much, but it is much longer compared to conventional IR motion sensors in which manufacturers say 90,000 hours. <br><br>  Body strength. <br>  The case made of Acrylonitrile-styrene-acrylate has tremendous strength, is resistant to chemicals, is not susceptible to temperature changes and changes in weather conditions, so the sensor can be installed almost anywhere. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/613/fae/e6d/613faee6dc5449c2ed721dd8c4709651.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  All this guarantees a long service life of the module and work in the most severe conditions. <br><br>  Frost protection. <br>  As we all know with you, extreme climatic conditions can have a detrimental effect on electrical equipment, I think not every infrared motion sensor living on the street will outlast our Russian winter.  That is why the manufacturer has developed a mode of intellectual protection against sudden changes in temperature. <br>  Frost protection automatically turns on when the temperature drops below -5 ¬∞ C and heats the PCB (printed circuit board) module, this allows the HDL-MSOUT.4W sensor to work smoothly for you in both summer and winter. <br><br>  Logic management. <br>  An even higher level of universality is achieved through the use of multi-logic inputs, which allows the module to be used in a variety of different scenarios and to issue events for more than 480 targets. <br>  For example, if a module detects movement, it can: switch on the security lights, close the shutters, activate the alarm, send an SMS message to the specified phone and notify the security service.  The only limit to creating different scenarios is only your own imagination. <br><br>  Multifunctionality. <br>  As I said, with this sensor you can easily get information about temperature, light, humidity and movement.  This allows us to monitor the basic environmental conditions, as well as to warn the owner of the house about potential intruders, and false alarms that often arise from the movement of domestic animals can be easily eliminated due to the adjustable sensitivity of the movement. <br><br>  Integration with security systems. <br>  The sensor can also be integrated with absolutely any existing security system or a warning system thanks to built-in dry contact modules.  This allows the module to use as a security system for your home not only HDL solutions, but also any other third-party security solutions used for the dry contact connection type. <br><br>  A little more about the functionality. <br>  The sensor has the logic OR, AND.  There are 24 logical blocks onboard, and true and false logic can lead to some customizable script.  Each logical blog allows you to use the module in a variety of different scenarios and issue events for 20 goals. <br>  Adjustable microwave sensitivity in the range from 1 to 100. <br>  All logic supports the trigger with a time delay from 0 to 3600 seconds. <br>  The range of the universal switch in the logic range 201-248, all logic has 2 universal switch numbers, the universal switch can be closed automatically with a time delay of 1-3600 seconds. <br>  At the program level, the firmware is constantly updated and periodically adds something new. <br><br>  Electrical parameters: <br>  Operating voltage: DC12-30V <br>  Power Consumption: 31mA / DC24V <br>  Temperature determination: -40 ¬∞ C ~ 60 ¬∞ C <br>  Detection of lighting: 0 ~ 15000LUX <br>  Detection of humidity 20 ~ 95  RH <br>  Microwave Detection: H: 7m D: 10m L: 6m <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f70/ef3/5c8/f70ef35c82c1fdc892f4323c2c1e0433.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  There are practically no fundamental differences between the KNX sensor and Buspro, but the KNX sensor can detect movement at a distance of up to 20 meters! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4d4/4cc/3e7/4d44cc3e76978c4a7d07fa4dec778c22.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  This is a very large range, which primarily protects the building, any intruders will be detected long before approaching the target.  The sensor does have a larger range and is more sensitive than ultrasonic and PIR sensors. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/394439/">https://habr.com/ru/post/394439/</a></p>
