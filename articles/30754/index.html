  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Comparative analysis of the effectiveness of high-and low-frequency queries in search engine promotion sites.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  As soon as the site optimization service appeared on the market, stable myths appeared that distort the essence of SEO technologies.  There is, for example, the opinion that the more often users enter a specific query in the search box, the more effective the optimization with the use of this query will be.  Even at the dawn of their activities, the optimizers themselves contributed to the emergence of this myth, but since then the mechanisms of the search engines have changed dramatically.  Changed and ways to achieve sites high positions in them.  Today, in each case, we have to convince customers of this, at least a little familiar with optimization services.  Best of all this helps dry numbers. <br>  We offer you a concrete example to get acquainted with how exactly the Internet marketing agency Matik optimizes and promotes websites.  The study below was conducted for the network of shops "Discus", whose main activity is the sale of diving equipment. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Purpose of the study: </h3>  a brief analysis of the feasibility of using in the promotion of the company's website various key queries, comparing the effectiveness of high-frequency (HF) and low-frequency (LF) requests. <br><h3>  The study period of the site: </h3>  January 20 to July 20, 2008 <br><h4>  Search engines: </h4>  Yandex, Google, Rambler <br>  The key queries selected for site optimization were divided into two groups - the high frequency group and the low frequency group.  The first group includes 13 requests and up to 10 of their various variations (in a different way, case, number), the second - 189 key requests also in different variations. <br><br>  Examples of search queries for research, you can see here - <br>  <a href="http://matik.ru/work/search-advance/183/">http://matik.ru/work/search-advance/183/</a> <br>  During the study period, 25,960 users navigated to the site from selected search engines, with: <br><ul><li>  on RF transition requests were recorded 11177 </li><li>  on low frequency queries - 14738 transitions </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/e8e/2bd/100/e8e2bd10013c9867ad43baf719608cc0.jpg" width="450" height="270" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><br>  High-frequency queries showed high efficiency, but it is clear that high efficiency cannot be achieved only with the help of HF.  After all, HF requests always accurately reflect the product or general category of business that users are looking for on the Internet, there cannot be many of them.  Low-frequency inquiries show efficiency due to the exact correspondence to the name of goods, services and the needs of potential clients offered on the site. <br>  The number of conversions performed by users on search engines is distributed as follows:

      <br>
    <h4>  From the Yandex search engine: </h4><br><ul><li>  10388 transitions were made for the HF query group, which is ensured by the stability of the site positions when issuing search results; </li><li>  12872 transitions were made for the group of LF requests. </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/afb/234/2bf/afb2342bf1c729cde010655c4fb2a113.jpg" width="450" height="269" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><br><h4>  From the Google search engine: </h4><br><ul><li>  671 transitions of users to the site were recorded for the group of RF requests; </li><li>  1746 transitions were made for the group of LF requests. </li></ul><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/3c2/ac9/be3/3c2ac9be38b9fc5a51db36663c1e2af3.jpg" width="450" height="269" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><br><br><h4>  From the Rambler search engine: </h4><br><ul><li>  118 requests to the site were made for the RF requests group; </li><li>  165 requests were recorded for the group of LF queries. </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/0a6/c7f/776/0a6c7f7763462a22029218520500213c.jpg" width="450" height="267" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><br><br><h4>  The percentage of conversions from different search engines: </h4><br><ul><li>  Google - 9.13% </li><li>  Rambler - 1.09% </li><li>  Yandex - 89.6% </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/776/aab/3be/776aab3be4c131c7064049861d890c72.jpg" width="450" height="268" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><br>  The results of the analysis show that according to the low frequency queries, the visitors from different search engines were attracted more than the high frequency group.  This is directly related to the number of different variations of writing key queries that users use.  There are only 13 requests in the RF group, and such a request is most often one word.  Each of the RF queries can be entered into the search string in a different number, gender, case, with a capital or small letter, that is, each query has about 10 different variations that the search engine will process in the same way as the same query. .  In the LF group, there are 189 queries, and for the most part these are not separate words, but phrases of 2-3 words.  There are variations on orders of magnitude greater, because the use of low-frequency queries more efficiently. <br>  A good example is also dry figures.  If the LF group consisted of only 189 requests, then as a result the site came to the leading position in the results of issuing: <br><ul><li>  in the Yandex system - more than 4500 requests; </li><li>  in the Google system - more than 1200 requests; </li><li>  in the Rambler system - more than 1000 requests. </li></ul><br>  If we consider that each of the requests that were counted in the study resulted in at least one visitor to the site, it becomes clear that the number of variations in the introduction of requests into the search engine turned out to be more important factor in promotion than the accuracy of high-frequency requests. <br>  There are a number of factors that favor the use of low-frequency queries.  For example, the cost of moving through the HF query group exceeded the budget for the promotion of low-frequency queries by two times.  In conclusion, it is worth noting that without using high-frequency queries to optimize the site, the result of the work would be almost half as much, because the high-frequency query group attracted more than 11,000 visitors to the site!  We believe that when promoting a site in search engines you should not give preference to one or another group of queries.  Only with the right combination of high-frequency and low-frequency queries can you achieve the maximum effect. <br><br>  <a href="http://matik.ru/publications/233/">Sergey Goncharov, Internet marketing specialist for Matik.</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/30754/">https://habr.com/ru/post/30754/</a></p>
