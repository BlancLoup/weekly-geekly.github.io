    <a name="habracut"></a><br>  The basis of the post formed the experience of the team and users of our designer. <br><br><h2>  (6+) Transport Constructor </h2><br><br>  <b><i>Prehistory</i></b>  It all started with an unsuccessful attempt to assemble a motorcycle from the designer ‚Äúala Soviet metal‚Äù - now there are many of them with different names: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cd6/95b/3f2/cd695b3f2b714c81a8ee364a3796122f.jpg"><br><br>  It should have turned out somehow, but the small one was distracted and ran off to ride a bike on the street.  Not bad either, but then we thought - is it possible to somehow ‚Äúcatch up‚Äù with its designer in outdoor games? <br><br>  <i><b>Experience.</b></i>  If you search, and whether there is something street and full-sized on the subject of design and transport, there is a solution - the Moov kit from Berg Toys. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0f2/1bc/fba/0f21bcfbabaf492db76924091b69d113.jpg"><br>  <i>Do such a designer Dutch</i> <br><br>  To him we are just eyeing.  First, we decide which one to take from the sets: maybe we‚Äôll confine ourselves to where there are three basic models for $ 200 (there is also a large set with 10 models for $ 500) excluding delivery. <br><br>  In the main, we are afraid how such a thing is adapted to our off-road.  In the video, everything bends easily: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/FOfW1U5s1Ok%3Ffeature%3Doembed%26start%3D37&amp;xid=17259,15700002,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhif5N8ru1UP9xAW2Y2U7L8ZQwS2KA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">In general, the Dutch have a lot of funny and rather expensive ideas:</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/73a/2fe/9e2/73a2fe9e214c47eabea591e2d7988c7c.jpg"><br>  The picture Ratata - pseudo-weapons for 185 euros. <br></div></div><br>  <b><i>What to replace.</i></b>  Surely, many in their childhood they tried to assemble ‚Äútheir own car‚Äù from scrap materials and wheels that had fallen off large ones. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e68/77a/9c2/e6877a9c214c4173bd995a51997ff6a0.jpg"><br><br>  So you can always try to cut out your version of the full-size transport constructor from any suitable material yourself. <br><br><h2>  (4+) Pseudo-Wooden Designer </h2><br><br>  <b><i>Prehistory</i></b>  We wondered how to instill in the child an interest in working with different materials, fixing something and helping dad.  I wanted "to be at home, without dirt and danger of injury."  So in the family appeared pseudo-wooden designer. <br><br>  <i><b>Experience.</b></i>  In this constructor, the wood is replaced with a non-sawdust and splinter EVA polymer.  And there are safe plastic tools: saws, a hammer with nails, screwdrivers with screws and even a hand mill.  That is, the child can be given without fear. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/233/c6e/fd2/233c6efd245242f5b89813b5a1eda2ac.jpg"><br><br>  Part of the models can be assembled according to the instructions enclosed in the box, but usually the child is interested in - and saws something of his own.  Either he chooses beautiful models from the package, for which there is no instruction for him, and as a result he also collects the models to his own taste.  With such a thing, a child can easily ‚Äústick‚Äù for two hours, and then he will still teach you to screw in screws and hammer in nails. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e4d/c68/c6b/e4dc68c6bb4f4b37883397b40a15d420.jpg"><br>  <i>Self assembly "robot".</i> <br><br>  Plus the fact that the details can be given any length, which is not achieved in the "plastic constructors with a screwdriver."  The downside is that the pieces spent on one model are more difficult to reuse - they are easily detached, but you cannot get away from plastic nails and screws.  They produce such sets ‚ÄúJunior Master‚Äù under the control of our compatriots (S + S Toys) in China. <br><br>  <i><b>What to replace.</b></i>  There are a lot of wooden constructors with similar parts - plates, bars and rounds.  It is inconvenient that some interesting sets go without connections. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b06/8f1/73e/b068f173eb2243b495245e2d273cab07.jpg"><br>  <i>As an example, the big designer of the Novosibirsk production ‚ÄúPelsi‚Äù: birch, without connections.</i>  <i>True, in smaller sets you can find pins.</i> <br><br>  Here either reconcile, or as the Austrian inventor Johan Corbuly - take a drill and invent your mount.  According to the legend, his constructor Matador was born - he reamed the cubes and put them on pins so that the younger son did not scatter the buildings of the older ones.  Here is his method: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/491/b4c/63d/491b4c63d328461888c89f4e31bacc8d.jpg"><br><br>  But what comes out of these sets: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dfe/f1a/714/dfef1a714dff4b2f90dc5323052cd155.jpg"><br><br><h2>  (2+) Railway </h2><br><br>  <b><i>Prehistory</i></b>  By the age of one and a half, the son was already with the tablet ‚Äúon you‚Äù and sat down on the toy, where the boy runs from the train on the tracks.  At the same time, he showed us how the fremium model works in applications.  To divert, they decided to buy him a ‚Äúreal‚Äù railway: for a start, wooden, with minimal detail. <br><br>  <i><b>Experience.</b></i>  Besides the fact that it was not so painful to step on a wooden road as on a metal road, the purchase turned out to be a real creative designer.  Because parts can be put together ‚Äúwrong‚Äù.  Here is the simplest example: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/603/e0c/ba1/603e0cba15a649899479988c8346326f.JPG"><br><br>  From such ‚Äúwrong‚Äù connections we get: a space rocket (entering the bridge + straight track, repeat twice), fortifications, houses, and so on.  However, sometimes for better compatibility, linear fixings have to be rounded off with sandpaper.  The original road was taken at Ikea (20 items cost only six hundred rubles), then the elements for it were purchased at various online stores. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/157/8ae/3f6/1578ae3f6c554218ac274042d9da9c8a.JPG"><br><br>  The only negative is that the set of basic elements is limited.  But they can be supplemented, for example, with details from the game "Genga". <br><br><h2>  (3+) Life hacking: if there is no Lego on hand ... </h2><br><br>  <b><i>Prehistory</i></b>  Sometimes it happens that you are visiting your grandmother, and your favorite details are not at hand.  What to replace? <br><br>  <b><i>Experience:</i></b> <b>1)</b> <i>Domino knuckles.</i>  To build a house on a carpet from dominoesk is a non-trivial task.  In addition to spatial thinking, it develops patience on a reasonable scale. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7bf/9aa/786/7bf9aa786c1d4fa3afe7f0d14615316c.JPG"><br><br>  <b><i>What to replace.</i></b>  If you get carried away with the concept of flattened blocks, like in dominoes, there are more sustainable solutions.  For example, Magna Tiles (left) and Magformers (right). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/809/b33/a91/809b33a910184180b7eb1f044fbf0bbd.jpg"><br><br>  The details in them are connected by magnets.  In such sets more colors, plus the child studies physics a little. <br><br>  <b>2)</b> <i>‚ÄúHereditary constructors‚Äù.</i>  For example, the parents of our support manager dug out such a copy for their grandson: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c28/0ca/d81/c280cad812124d6486b234a11ac070dc.jpg"><br>  <i>This is the designer Mottik, which in the 1990s was sold almost by weight.</i> <br><br>  His son really likes it, including because ‚Äúdaddy was playing‚Äù.  So it develops family traditions.  Surely many, if you dig, there are remnants of the old children's designers.  Feel free to let them in the case. <br><br><h2>  (2+) Designer pillows </h2><br><br>  <i><b>Prehistory</b></i>  Selling it came up with a man with an inverted consciousness - Australian.  We stumbled upon a project on ‚ÄúKickstarter‚Äù, where a man collected pre-orders (from $ 200 to 700, depending on the complexity of the set).  Judging by the updates, with the production of Squishy Forts and so far went wrong. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0da/26e/6fd/0da26e6fd7b1424487a8d19562480ca6.jpg"><br><br>  <i><b>Experience.</b></i>  Of course, we did not even think about leaving a pre-order.  A designer of furniture and interior items is a great thing that a priori is in any home.  Firstly, there are no problems with the compatibility of parts - everything can be used: pillows, blankets, chairs, a sofa.  Secondly, the rebuild speed is off scale. <br><br>  Thirdly, it is possible to conduct electricity: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0b0/ae9/a9b/0b0ae9a9b3414c229c1693cd74f6498e.jpg"><br><br>  Finally, it works great to distract the child if you restrict his access to the digital world.  And it helps to teach to clean up after themselves.  Which is also important. <br><br>  <i><b>What to replace:</b></i> it is priceless. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ddd/c67/b56/dddc67b56d5d4781b956379a12823cb0.jpg"><br><br>  But if you ruin the sofas is still not an option, on the Internet, TikeStix comes across - ‚Äúa large-size designer for the construction of houses, shelters and other handicrafts in the kid‚Äôs height‚Äù. <br><br><h2>  (4+) Designer Gears </h2><br><br>  <i><b>Prehistory</b></i>  ‚ÄúGears, Gears, Gears‚Äù is a bunch of separate worlds, as in ‚ÄúLego‚Äù, only the idea is not built on cubes, but on gears and platforms for them.  We saw it on Amazon, we decided that we would show our son how simple mechanisms work.  And at the same time let's introduce the first interest in assembling moving platforms - we hope that after some time we will move on to programmable ones. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d07/213/1ea/d072131ea4c64c66906ee5868e6f820c.JPG"><br><br>  <i><b>Experience.</b></i>  Such a thing as in the picture is going to us now.  The manufacturer has a set with a motor, from which the machine, a helicopter and a bike are obtained.  All wealth is worth 35 bucks. <br><br>  The most important thing is that the gears are not only for beauty here: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/sXs3c1zByOc%3Ffeature%3Doembed%26start%3D9&amp;xid=17259,15700002,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhrEVlRrFq_BCoz6OTTeH7o-pr9OQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  And after the assembly, we will begin to return the child to the digital world - now there are just a lot of logic games about gears. <br><br><h2>  (6-8 +) Minecraft </h2><br><br>  <i><b>Prehistory</b></i>  The current generation of children has gone even deeper into the virtual worlds, and we need to compensate for this by applying games with benefits. <br><br>  <i><b>Experience.</b></i>  It is in our childhood minecraft sessions started on the May holidays with the landing of potatoes.  Today in the world of minecraft you can come straight from ‚ÄúLego‚Äù - they release themed sets.  Why, Minecraft even has an origami version: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/V5wpvTKqotA%3Ffeature%3Doembed%26start%3D56&amp;xid=17259,15700002,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhg390r4pMk-KwVoyncYYiY8eWfeGQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Well, the original game itself is a wonderful digital constructor, capable of giving birth to the very interest with which many began in the profession: ‚ÄúMake your own game.‚Äù <br><br>  No wonder now Minecraft is used in children's programming courses.  The phrase ‚Äúprogramming fighting robots-turtles‚Äù sounds great, even if you are not 6-8 years old. <br><br><h2>  (9+) Website Builder </h2><br><br>  <i><b>Prehistory</b></i>  ‚ÄúMake your site‚Äù is probably the equally popular answer to the question ‚Äúhow did your interest in technology start,‚Äù as the idea to make your game.  We did not think that someone would use our designer to create personal websites or child samples of the pen: yes, there are templates with cars and for starting it is enough to move blocks, ... but officially we are talking about a small business. <br><br>  <b><i>Experience.</i></b>  Nevertheless, during the next monitoring of new sites created on the platform, Finn looked at us from one of the pages: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/36e/eae/6ba/36eeae6ba9b941b394320e33542833f4.png"><br><br>  At first we thought someone was kidding.  But the fact is that for English-speaking users there is only a paid version - and the money for the site was written off monthly from someone's card.  We became interested and contacted.  It turned out that the parents decided to keep their son's school assignment to mind: ‚ÄúMake a web page‚Äù. <br><br>  The task itself was in another section of the site.  This was a page about Tim Berners-Lee: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/963/712/556/9637125569d54fa480b360dcb1b7c4a3.png"><br><br>  Everything is easier in Russian localization - there is a free version.  There, too, quickly found examples.  Here is the site of nine-year-old Gregory, a young Lego fan who shoots his cartoons with the characters of the designer: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/952/c5d/4a6/952c5d4a615b46bab9f4d6c4ad730df7.png"><br><br>  He was addicted to designers since childhood (which was not over yet), in the digital world Minecraft is most respected.  The teenage Internet vogue mod (video blogging) touched him too, but Grisha decided not to show any shit, but pulled out his ‚ÄúLego‚Äù, began to master photo and video editors - and now he has cool video notes on how to make the lego-figure move and jump in the frame. <br><br>  The site started, because the whole project proudly calls a ‚Äústudio‚Äù.  And the studio should have a website.  And for some reason we think that the guy is going well. <br><br>  <b>PS</b> How do you maintain a balance between digital and offline activities in your family?  What designers use "for education"? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/394057/">https://habr.com/ru/post/394057/</a></p>
