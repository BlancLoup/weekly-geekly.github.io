Neither of the parties can receive this money without the consent of the other party or the decision of the Arbitration. <br><br>  The benefits to all parties are obvious: <br>  1. <b>The customer</b> does not risk their money.  The customer does not give money to the performer until he finishes the work (until the customer confirms the completion of the project), due to this he is insured against the banal ‚Äúkidka‚Äù. <br>  2. <b>The</b> contractor sees that the customer has money, and that they will be received upon completion of the project, and in the event of a conflict, it will be possible to contact the Arbitrage and the dispute will be resolved. <br>  3. The <b>service</b> earns from this (by the way, on freelans.ru the commission is 10% - 2% more than the tax on the simplified tax system without VAT in Belarus), and an additional service that can attract users.

      Here is <a href="http://www.free-lance.ru/service/mediator/">a handout.</a> <br><h4>  Practice. </h4><br><a name="habracut"></a><h5>  Rule </h5><br>  I "on duty" more than once used the services of a trust, including  on frnla.s.ru, it is really convenient, even on large projects if there is a certain amount of cash and you can not ask for prepayment.  And it <b>usually took place quickly and painlessly</b> (well, except when I gave 10% of the budget a fat amphibian creature reproachfully looked at me and tried to block the access of oxygen to my lungs), once even had to participate in the proceedings through Arbitrage, but the whole procedure took very little time and the dispute was resolved, in my opinion, adequately. <br><h5>  Happening. </h5><br>  Therefore, when the next order was received and the description indicated ‚Äúno prepayment‚Äù, we quickly agreed to use the RRF and set to work.  In the process, as usual, minor additions / alterations appeared and the project was completed not in the originally scheduled time, but qualitatively and ‚Äúwith buns‚Äù.  After that, he was transferred to the customer for testing on his server, it (testing) was completed much faster than it was under the contract, the identified problems were fixed the next day and we were at the finish line - time to close the project. <br>  The customer, referring to the fact that we did not meet the deadlines, asked to help him with another project (" <b>two little tasks</b> "), then asked to figure out the configuration error of the new server where our project moved.  <b>I did it</b> , although I usually clearly cut off tasks not according to my project.  Anyway, after this the transaction was completed and feedback was given on joint work. <br><br><h5>  An exception. </h5><br>  It would seem - waiting honestly earned - en-no. <br><br>  The next morning, the <b>customer asked to do one more thing</b> on another project and <b>mentioned that he had not yet given confirmation of the transaction in a personal message</b> .  Because  it was already <b>obvious blackmail,</b> he received a polite refusal to find a person who would deal with his requests, and I should be contacted only if a hidden bug was found in the project for which I was paid, the customer answered that in this case he would not confirm permission to withdraw means. <br><h5>  Unknown exception </h5><br>  An obvious solution to the problem was to contact support, which was immediately done: <br><blockquote>  Suddenly there was a problem. <br>  Yesterday, before the completion of the transaction, the customer asked for compensation for the delay, in addition to what was done.  on the site, fix a few errors in the game management paenli with which the store is docked and transfer the store to a new server. <br>  Quote from ICQ: Customer (16:40:05 6/07/2010) <br>  I asked you to help with a small question, which finally compensated for almost a month delay in the project. " <br><br>  These works were completed, after which the customer completed the payment and we exchanged feedback. <br><br>  This morning I received a new request for a socket, which I refused to fulfill.  In response, the customer refuses to confirm completion of the transaction. <br>  Quote from ICQ: Customer (12:08:40 7/07/2010) <br>  Well then, take your words back :-) " <br>  I beg: <br>  1. complete withdrawal of funds <br>  2. Ban the customer for default and blackmail. <br>  If necessary, I will provide ICQ logs. </blockquote><br><br>  In response, to put it mildly, I was discouraged: <br><blockquote>  The BezRisk Deal 07.07.10 at 14:00: Andrei, you must resolve this issue yourself, as the employer has already confirmed the completion of the Transaction and none of you can contact the Arbitrage to consider this situation. </blockquote><br>  Translating into Russian - the <b>transaction is completed</b> , therefore the services of arbitration cannot be used, but the <b>money will not be paid</b> until the completion of the transaction is confirmed by the customer. <br><br>  After several questions like ‚Äúhow can this be, and what to do now‚Äù, they told me that within 2 days they would give me an answer.  In my opinion, 2 days for such an issue (what to do next) is a bit too much, but it's not so bad - we have time for the weekend.  I was wrong.  Two days have passed ‚Äî there is no answer, and there is no response to the repeated appeal of the reaction.  Online consultants are kicking at <a href="http://www.free-lance.ru/users/norisk/opinions/">RRF</a> , RRF - continue to keep silent and do not read my messages through the web interface.  The weekend is approaching, which means that I have all the chances that the solution of the issue and the money will hang until Tuesday, or even longer. <br><h4>  Exception handling </h4><br>  The BezRiska deal 07/09/10 at 18:39: <br><blockquote>  Hello. <br><br>  Andrew, we can not pay you money now, because the second party does not agree with this.  There are visible differences in the Deal, which ones - only the arbitrator will be able to find out.  Therefore, we have accepted your Arbitrage Deal. <br><br>  We want to warn you: Arbitration reasoning deals only in accordance with the real facts and in fairness.  Arbitrage is a disinterested party. <br>  If everything is exactly as you described earlier, then the Arbitration will take the appropriate correct decision. </blockquote><br><br>  After this message - I relaxed completely, everything is exactly as I described, no problems should arise. <br><br>  13.07.10 - a project demo was requested to assess the compliance of the TK <br>  07/15/10 - My answer to the list of ‚Äúdeficiencies‚Äù according to the statement of work is requested. <br>  07/19/10 - Decision issued. <br><br><blockquote>  The Bezirisk transaction on July 19, 2010 at 10:43 am: <br>  Good day! <br><br>  We made a decision and <b>give you 60%</b> of the reserved amount, the rest of the money is returned to the employer due to the fact that there was a big delay in the project. </blockquote><br>  To say that I am very surprised is to say nothing. <br><br>  <b>Data:</b> <br>  1. the project was completed (the work was done more than it was in the task to compensate for the delay and the adequacy of the compensation was confirmed by the customer in the recall). <br>  2. the project is handed over and accepted (this is confirmed by the feedback and closure of the project) <br>  3. There were no penalties for a delay in the contract (and if you close your eyes to the moral side, then nobody cares about the delay, and the maximum allows you to abandon the project before receiving it). <br><br><h4>  Findings. </h4><br>  <b>For 10%</b> of the project amount, you can get <b>problems even after the transaction is completed</b> , because  "Final confirmation of the transaction" is in personal messages. <br>  The RRF does not protect your interests - this project is usually different from the assignment (especially made by the customer), and <b>in the case of arbitration, watch bubl only on TK</b> . <br>  <b>RRF disciplines</b> - all actions that depart from the initial task will need to be confirmed at least through the service, and it is better to <b>renew the deal with the new conditions</b> , because the customer can always take his words back. <br>  The decision-making mechanism in the Arbitration is not transparent: it is not based on the law or open rules, but on something else (I have already requested information about this when I get to publish it), and this is not always clear. <br><br><h3>  Recommendations. </h3><br>  If you want to get guaranteed money: <br>  <s>0. Avoid RRF and do not transfer the results of the work to the customer before receiving the money.</s> <br>  1. Not to deviate from the TOR a single step, even to the detriment of the project <br>  2. Not all actions on the transfer to the test are recorded through messages in the transaction <br>  3. Not to trust the customer, all he said is worth nothing in the case of arbitration). <br><br>  It is clear that these recommendations <s>(except for the 0th)</s> greatly complicate the work, but I have no other ideas, maybe you?  Because  Now the toad will definitely not let me work through this service. <br><br><br>  UPD1: <br>  Explanations were received regarding this case: <br>  1. The 40% discount is due to the discrepancy with the TK (not recorded in the comments to the transaction) and the delay in terms. <br>  2. The arbitration did not take into account the add.  work as compensation because  it was not in the deal. <br><br>  The most important thing: Arbitration takes into account <b>only TK and messages within the transaction</b> , it does not accept any other evidence. <br><br>  Be careful and scrupulous in matters of change, fix everything only in comments to the transaction. <br>  Otherwise, being right in essence, they can beat you in form. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/98717/">https://habr.com/ru/post/98717/</a></p>
