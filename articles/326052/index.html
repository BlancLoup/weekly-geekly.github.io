We have released the 3rd edition of the Swift language book.  In the course of a long and fruitful communication with many of you, a lot of ideas were developed, thanks to which the new edition became really useful.  In comparison with the previous edition, this book contains the following changes and additions: <br><br>  - All material is updated in accordance with Swift version 3.0 and Xcode 8. <br>  - Added a large number of new educational material, in particular, related to learning the basics of programming. <br>  - Reworked a chapter on collections.  Now her study will be for you the same pleasant task as the study of the rest of the material. <br>  - Significantly improved chapters on functions and closures.  In them you will find a lot of new and interesting, including those related to the changes that came with Swift 3.0. <br>  - Added auxiliary chapters that allow you to dive even deeper into the material under study.  In particular, now there will be no problems with the study of lazy calculations. <br>  - Considered the wishes and comments of users on the design and content. <br>  - Fixed typos found. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  About the book </h3><br>  This book contains comprehensive information for all who wish to learn how to program in Swift language in order to create their own iOS applications (including for macOS, tvOS and watchOS) or programs for the Linux operating system.  In the course of reading the book, you will find not only theoretical information, but also a large number of practical examples and tasks, performing which you will deepen your knowledge of the material being studied.  Despite the fact that you have a long way to go, this will be a useful and very important experience.  Although the book is primarily intended to directly learn the Swift language, you will receive some basic information about the principles for developing full-fledged applications.  You can be sure this information will be very useful.  I (the author) believe that the book will give you the opportunity to learn a new language and soon begin to write your own applications for the App Store or Mac App Store.  After studying the language, in the future you will be able to choose for which platform to create programs.  Despite the fact that the book contains information on development and under the Linux operating system, the main focus is on development on the platform from Apple. The code examples in this book correspond to Swift version not lower than 3.0, iOS version not lower than 10 and Xcode version not lower than 8 If you have more recent versions, do not worry, all of the described material is more likely to work for you without any errors.  But the small possibility that Apple will slightly change the Swift syntax does exist.  If you encounter such a situation, I ask you to treat with understanding and inform me (the author) about this at the email address book@swiftme.ru. <br><br><h3>  Book structure </h3><br>  The book consists of four large parts and one application:

      <b>Part I. Preparing for the development of Swift-applications.</b>  In the first part, you will begin your journey into the world of Swift, follow the most important and necessary steps before starting to develop your own applications.  You will learn how to create your own Apple ID account, how to connect to the apple developers program, where to get the Swift development environment, how to work with it. <br><br>  <b>Part II.</b>  <b>Basic Swift features.</b>  After becoming familiar with the Xcode development environment, which allows you to begin learning a programming language, you will learn the basic features of Swift.  You will learn what Swift syntax has, what are variables and constants, what data types exist and how to use all this when developing programs. <br><br>  <b>Part III.</b>  <b>Fixed assets Swift.</b>  The third part focuses on the consideration and study of the most simple, but very interesting means of Swift.  You may not have heard of some of them (for example, tuples), others (for example, arrays) you probably used in other languages. <br><br>  <b>Part IV.</b>  <b>Nontrivial Swift features.</b>  The fourth part describes in detail the techniques for working with the most powerful and functional tools Swift.  You will use the material of this part with enviable regularity when creating your own applications in the future.  Also, a distinctive feature of this part is a lot of practical work on creating the first interactive application. <br><br>  <b>Application.</b>  Changes and innovations Swift 3.0.  If you studied any of the previous versions of Swift, then the information provided in this application will allow you to quickly get acquainted with all the innovations and changes that have brought a new version of the programming language. <br><br>  ¬ªMore information about the book can be found on <a href="https://www.piter.com/collection/all/product/swift-osnovy-razrabotki-prilozheniy-pod-ios-i-macos-3-e-izd-dopolnennoe-i-pererabotannoe">the publisher's website.</a> <br>  ¬ª <a href="http://storage.piter.com/upload/contents/978549603036/978549603036_X.pdf">Table of Contents</a> <br>  ¬ª <a href="http://storage.piter.com/upload/contents/978549603036/978549603036_p.pdf">Excerpt</a> <br><br>  For Habrozhiteley 25% discount coupon - <b>Swift</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/326052/">https://habr.com/ru/post/326052/</a></p>
