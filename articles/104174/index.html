  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Who is he, a domestic IT leader?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  More and more IT companies are concerned about the search for managers, so-called IT leaders, or simply - specialists for a leadership position ( <a href="http://www.e-xecutive.ru/education/adviser/1375019/">proof</a> ). <br>  But what exactly is invested in the concept of the IT leader of the company and why their searches do not bring the desired results?  <i>See the answer tonight on TNT!</i> <br>  But seriously, there is a clear violation of logic in the requirements for <b>knowledge</b> and <b>skills</b> .  And now I will explain why. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So, first of all the specialist himself.  There are 2 requirements for it at once - to be aware of modern technologies and methods of their application, and to be able to lead people. <br>  However, the question immediately arises, why does such a specialist go to work as a hired employee?  After all, he can organize his own business.  He knows what to do and how to communicate with programmers. <br>  There may be the only way of cooperation - this is a partnership, when, in addition to high salaries, the IT leader gets <a href="http://e-servis.biz/">options</a> , as is done in large foreign companies.  His contribution to the work is similar to a bank account - if he worked well, he receives payments from the company, which are significantly larger than the RFP, and most importantly, not only subordinates but also direct managers listen to his opinion. <br>  If we compare the creation of an IT project with the construction of a house, then ordinary programmers are builders building the module behind the module code, and the IT leader is the construction company that provides the architectural design, approval and control over its construction. <br><br>  However, in the sphere of domestic IT-companies, especially those that work for outsourcing, and such - the majority, completely different concepts are put into the term of the IT-leader. <br>  First of all, there can be no talk of any freedom of choice or of voicing your opinion.  The manager, communicating directly with the customer, at the highest level, collects general ideas about the requirements, which will then be refined as the work progresses. <br>  And from the IT leader is required to create a project for fuzzy TK, which also will be changed several times. <br>  In this case, the IT leader plays the role of a foreman, and the management with the customer plays the role of an extravagant blonde who ordered repairs in her apartment, ‚Äúso that it would be European-style glamorous, and at a price cheap.‚Äù <br>  And it begins.  Today - "I want a pink wall."  Tomorrow - ‚ÄúI changed my mind, I want gold wallpaper.‚Äù  The day after tomorrow - ‚ÄúNo, let it be white plaster, I will paint it myself.‚Äù <br>  In fact, the head of such a company, a clean manager, does not understand why the code needs to be changed so drastically, as the blonde does not understand, why preparing walls for wallpaper or paint requires different primers and putty. <br>  Yes, they do not want to understand, they pay money, and you, IT-foreman get out how you want.  And explain to tired programmers why the program's algorithm has changed once again and what needs to be changed now. <br><br>  Thus, on the modern IT market, a telepath with the skills of prophecy, who can read the customer‚Äôs thoughts at a distance and anticipate possible changes, is required most of all to initially approach the project so that it is completed on time and satisfied the customer. </div>
