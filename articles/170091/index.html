Another gadget stayed in my hands for a week.  This is the BlackBerry Z10 - a new milestone in the history of the Canadian company, which, by the way, is no <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/167691/">longer called RIM</a> .  Research in Motion is now BlackBerry.  (Apparently, the cult of another fruit company known to us made us think about rebranding ...) <br><br>  I can not say that the BlackBerry 10 is the story of another Android or iOS.  It seems that recently operating systems do not want to copy iOS and Android and try to avoid similarities, while at the same time perverting themselves. <a name="habracut"></a>

      And for me - it would be better to steal, because you want to see the logic in communication with the device, and not a chair with two legs, or, conversely, ten. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/3iN4f_ATPgc%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhi1CKfzZfG6Oahg_75UqmnOCHcUrA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  BlackBerry is the very fantasy of ‚Äúdevelopers-mazahistov‚Äù, since the navigation UI in BlackBerry 10 is not clear to me and is not very pleasant yet.  But all mobile OS faced it (except, iOS 1.0, I think).  But first things first. <br><br>  <b>BlackBerry Z10 Specs</b> <br><br>  Dimensions: 130 x 65.6 x 9 mm <br>  Networks: GSM 850/900/1800/1900 HSDPA 850/900/1900/2100 <br>  Display: TFT 4.2 ‚Äù, resolution 1280 x 768 pixels, 356 ppi <br>  Camera: 8 megapixel, autofocus, video Full HD 30 fps, diode flash. <br>  Front camera: 2 megapixel <br>  Memory: 16 GB internal, support for microSD memory cards (up to 64 GB) <br>  RAM: 2 GB <br>  Processor: 2-core Qualcomm S4 MSM8960, 1.5 GHz <br>  Battery: 1800 mAh <br>  Talk time - up to 11 hours <br>  Standby time - up to 408 hours <br>  Music playback time: 60 hours, video: 10 hours <br><br>  <b>Design</b> <br><br><img src="http://rozetked.ru/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/BlackBerry-Z10.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  I really liked the design, the Z10 is covered in front with glass, and behind it with a nice sheshrshavy plastic, which resembles a soft-touch.  The phone looks very concise, fashionable and at the same time it still ‚Äúsmells‚Äù of a business product. <br><br>  I was holding both white and black versions in my hands and, I assure you, both look good.  It is the design that is the strongest side of the BlackBerry product.  I now use iPhone 5 and I don‚Äôt really like the fact that it is too thin and light: in Z10 everything is perfect in my opinion. <br><br><img src="http://rozetked.ru/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/white-blackberry-z10-pictures-hands-on-0.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  And I especially want to say "thank you" to the developers, that the white version of the front remains black.  Still, from the experience of using the white iPhone 4, only deplorable memories emerge about how the front light frame does not contrast with the black screen. <br><br>  <b>OS</b> <br><br>  <i>Note</i> : a preview of the BlackBerry 10 at Habrahabr [ <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/167673/">link</a> ] <br><br>  In the country, OS BlackBerry 10 takes the position of a recruit, and is far from perfect.  According to first impressions, 10 is a ‚Äúdoped‚Äù version of BlackBerry OS 7, since the system‚Äôs spirit still hovers somewhere in the clouds: the same fonts are used here (the settings application is the same), the same graphics are used.  It is unfortunate that BlackBerry has not made a completely new OS.  The company was afraid of losing those few customers that it already has, but in vain - sometimes you can win by putting everything at stake. <br><br>  But, despite all the ‚Äúdampness‚Äù of the project, it is safe to say that BlackBerry 10 is a very stable system, as it is built on QNX.  [ <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/124656/">qnx article</a> ] <br><br>  Review of OS 10 should be devoted to a separate review, so I will highlight the pros and cons: <br><br>  Pros: <br>  - A single BlackBerry ID that is not required to connect BIS and BES (for BBM, for example) <br>  - The function of "sharing" the screen to another BlackBerry 10 device over the Internet <br>  - Ability to open the alarm from the lock screen <br>  - "Smart" keyboard <br>  - Camera with time shift function <br>  - QNX unbreakable core (in other words, stability) <br><br>  Minuses: <br>  - An extremely small number of applications in BlackBerry World <br>  - Lack of visual notifications <br>  - Ability to set only one alarm (in fact) <br>  - Insufficient smooth interface (with Snapdragon S4 Plus processor!) <br><br>  <b>Battery</b> <br><br>  The Z10 is equipped with a removable Li-ion 1800 mAh battery.  It grabs the BlackBerry like any other modern Android device or iPhone. <br>  I filmed the BlackBerry with charging at about 10 in the morning and by 7 in the evening he was sitting down.  A familiar story. <br><br>  <b>LTE</b> <br><br>  The NoMobile blog <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/nomobile/blog/167681/">said</a> that the Z10 supports Russian LTE networks.  I didn‚Äôt manage to check it, because I‚Äôm not catching 4G at home (this time), and secondly, I use Beeline, and Megafon and MTS offer non-cheap tariffs and didn‚Äôt want to buy a SIM card for one occasion.  <i>Habravchane friends, if someone has information regarding this - write in a personal or in a comment, it would be interesting to find out and add information to the post.</i> <br><br>  <b>General impressions</b> <br><br>  I liked the design and individual features.  I did not like the operating system: it requires additional work.  BlackBerry needs to further refresh its understanding of graphical interfaces in order to get really good.  And yet, the phone left a good impression, it is like a big breakthrough towards the future.  I think (though not on the Russian market) BlackBerry will succeed and in 3-4 years OS 10 will have good popularity, but not before this deadline ... <br><br>  <b>General impressions # 2 (for BlackBerry fans)</b> <br><br>  Of course, people who use BlackBerry devices, who are already accustomed to BIS and BES, who appreciate BBM, who like corporate thinking, who eventually know BlackBerry OS from heels to the top ... they like the Z10, as this is a well-done old BlackBerry.  I have never had feelings for RIM, so I can‚Äôt share the excitement with these people, but I think many people agree with me. <br><br>  <b>PS</b> The prototype of the BlackBerry Z10, codenamed London, in my opinion, was even nicer than the final product. <br><br><img src="http://rozetked.ru/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/bb_london_the_verge2-1.jpeg" alt="image"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/170091/">https://habr.com/ru/post/170091/</a></p>
