  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Drug dealer who was determined by IP by checking the package from China</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Harold Bates was involved in a complex scheme of supplying an illegal narcotic substance from China to the USA, <a href="http://geektimes.ru/post/248792/">which cannot be called</a> .  The criminals were found thanks to the tracking of mailings - Bates checked where the packet is from the same IP. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/90f/ba1/8b1/90fba18b1e84dd0b3d4acb63dd478086.jpg" width="600" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Investigators of the USPS USPS discovered 500 grams of a substance that turned out to be a narcotic substance.  The package was supposed to go to Hollywood, Florida.  Investigators manually checked the logs on the tracking site and found the IP address.  Then they checked which other packages were being tracked from the same address. <br><br>  <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/05/how-the-usps-targeted-a-drug-dealer-via-his-ip-address">The mail team determined</a> that the IP address belonged to the Comcast unit, and contacted the company.  Comcast on request reported that the subscriber was Matthew Demadzhio.  But Demagio from September 2013 was in prison for armed robbery.  Then the USPS checked the address of the subscriber - it turned out to be Harold Bates.

      Over the previous six months, Bates received a number of parcels from China at the same address.  Each time, Bates himself took away the parcels, not waiting for home delivery.  Therefore, the investigators decided that he would repeat these actions again. <br><br>  In November 2013, Bates arrived for another package and paid in cash.  He took the bags to his home and hid tight trash bags in the trash.  Police checked the contents of the bags.  Bates was clearly involved in the business with China, so the investigation continued. <br><br>  In December 2013, two more packages came in the name of Bates.  He tracked them from the same IP and received information about a location update at satva1100@ymail.com, previously associated with his premises.  The investigator checked two packages using a dog named Lucky, trained to search for drugs.  In a large room, he placed the packages along with several other packages that were beyond suspicion. <br><br>  December 7, 2013 Harold Bates was arrested.  He admitted receiving packages from China, said that he paid for them with the help of Western Union.  He agreed to provide his laptop and phone for verification and gave passwords to e-mail and a Skype account. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/356752/">https://habr.com/ru/post/356752/</a></p>
