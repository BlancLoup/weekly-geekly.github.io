And you will not find a ready-made recipe anywhere to help with this.  But, to conduct an advertising campaign that will help get a lot of installations and even get to the top, it is quite possible. <br>  It has its own features to promote Android and iOS applications.  But in this post I want to touch on the general stages. <br><br>  So where to start? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/445/b26/d4f/445b26d4f2446f8d45fedabd654c4c47.jpg">

      <b>Promotion begins before the publication of the application.</b>  Before the application is published, it is necessary to prepare a site, a press release, a press kit, videos, communities in social networks.  It is not necessary to use all of the above.  But be sure to provide some kind of online presence (information about the application, the ability to contact the developer, information for journalists).  At the same stage, contact the press and agree on the publication of the release or review of the application. <br><br>  A little more detail on each item. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>Site.</b>  If you think that the application is serious and will find its audience, then there should be no doubt about the creation of the site.  The site is needed for technical support of users and for branding.  Create it before the release of the application.  What for?!  First, collect email addresses of potential users.  Secondly, to test the application to the target audience (you can conduct a survey on the site or give access to a closed version of the application).  Thirdly, the presence of the site will allow you to establish primary contacts with the press (you can send them a pitch, a video, a link to the site before the application is launched). <br><br>  Site availability is one of the key points of promotion. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7fc/3b0/158/7fc3b0158016bd955a42c8e6aaa7755c.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Press release.</b>  Some might think that this is an old-school promotion method.  But as practice shows, it is not.  It is important not to forget that we are promoting a mobile application, so the press release is written by its own rules.  Here is a great <a href="http://www.mavilleavant.com/Barcelona_Then_and_Now-Press_Release.pdf">example</a> that you can use when writing your own news. <br><br>  In the release, do not forget to specify the unique features of the application, reliable facts (figures) and try to ensure that the news is not more than one page.  Information for the release: the name of the application, key characteristics, general information that will interest the journalist and he will continue reading, introduction, screenshots, description, price, link to the application, information about the company, contact information. <br><br>  An important addition.  When you send a release to a journalist, you do not need to attach it to a separate file.  Just add it to the end of the letter or give a link to the press kit. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d46/e82/c2d/d46e82c2d82246997ffc17e4a2bf4971.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Press kit</b>  It is needed so that the information can be easily accessed, so that a journalist can, if necessary, obtain it without wasting time.  You can create a separate page for the press on your website.  Here is a good <a href="http://www.kupongid.ru/iskidki/press-kit/page.html">example</a> .  The press kit contains an application icon in good quality, screenshots, a press release, links to applications, a site, social networks.  It's great if you offer some kind of bonus to the press (install the application for free, tips inside the application, etc.).  There is a special (free) service that will help you make a press kit in 30 minutes - <a href="http://dopresskit.com/">http://dopresskit.com/</a> .  Or the press kit can be in the form of an archived file. <br><br>  Once you have prepared all the materials, you can begin your <b>communication with the press and bloggers</b> .  These people are very busy, they receive a large number of requests every day, so it‚Äôs important that you remember it.  And it is equally important that information about your application is published for free.  Therefore, it is necessary to prepare a short letter with a personal appeal to the journalist (it is necessary to google, find the name of the person to whom you are applying, or you can send a message via LinkedIn / Facebook).  You send an email in which you indicate the key points of your application.  It turns out a short press release or pitch.  It is necessary to indicate: the name, what the application does and what is its feature, price, link to the site (press kit), link to the application, screenshot, video (if any), description, contact information.  A great <a href="http://www.appdesignvault.com/downloads/SamplePitchDocument.pdf">pitch example</a> for your application.  No press release is required.  If necessary, the journalist will request it or find it on his own in the press kit. <br><br>  If you start communicating with a journalist before the release of the application, be sure to specify the release date in the letter.  To the news appeared on the day of release. <br><br>  If you are wondering <b>where to post news about your application</b> , then Quora has a great thread on this topic on foreign resources.  <a href="http://www.quora.com/What-are-the-best-blogs-about-Android">Android</a> and <a href="http://www.quora.com/iOS-Applications/What-are-the-best-websites-and-blogs-for-reviewing-rating-and-discovering-iPhone-and-iPad-apps">iOS</a> . <br><br>  After the release of the application, be sure to follow all references, collect user feedback, respond to them not only with words, but with corrections. <br><br>  Also, I would like to draw your attention to the most effective way to bring the application to the top.  It is not a rare case when a decent application is launched, but due to the saturation of the market it is absolutely not in demand, as it is simply lost in the rating.  In such cases, it is necessary to bring the application to the top in other ways, so that it becomes noticeable and starts to pump it out.  This task is perfectly handled by services for the promotion of applications that provide motivated installation.  There are a lot of them, but in my opinion the most reliable and qualitative one is <a href="https://apptrack.ru/">apptrack.ru</a> . <br>  How it works.  You contact the service, describe your application in detail and they develop a strategy for bringing the application to the top (required number of installations and positive feedback).  Then the service specialists will give you a detailed description of everything and you place an order for the number of installations and positive feedback you need.  Further service providers begin to fulfill your order.  And all - you are in the top!  The best part is that these are not robots, but all performers are real people (the service provides each artist's e-mail for your order) and if your app is worthy of it, they begin to actively use it.  It is also a pleasant moment - there are no minimum orders in the service (you can order at least 1 installation), which allows developers, even with a small budget, to use the service by promoting their application in the rating and of course it makes it clear that the service is really working.  Therefore, if you consider your application interesting and competitive, it makes sense to spend a little on bringing it to the top, and then everything depends on the application itself. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/184038/">https://habr.com/ru/post/184038/</a></p>
