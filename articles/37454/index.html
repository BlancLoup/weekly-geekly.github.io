  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Investor Answers</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  After two ( <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/invest/36634/">1</a> and <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/invest/36629/">2</a> ) parts of the review of ‚ÄúDomestic‚Äù investors, the players of this market are more or less marked.  Many of them do not yet have more than one developed / purchased project.  This is logical, because investing in startups is only gaining momentum, and I sincerely hope that this is not just another boom that will soon collapse. <br><br>  In the process of discussing the first part of the publication, I highlighted the questions, the answers to which could be useful to the developers.  Then he sent letters to all companies from the list.  Answers were received from Finam, JumpIDEA, Inventure and QD (not a lot), there were a total of 12. <br><br>  <b>upd</b> This post is now in the <a href="http://venturemag.ru/2008/08/19/otvety-investorov/">Venture Magazine</a> blog.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Questions were formulated as follows: <br><br>  1. What is the share of the investor if the project is selected?  Are other patterns of distribution of shares possible?  What will happen to the share of "ideologue" in the sale of shares (exit from the project) by the investor. <br><br>  2. If you are ready to invest in an idea, is it necessary for the ‚Äúideologue‚Äù to move to an office or you can work remotely.  Is a team required? <br><br>  3. Are there any projects you have started?  If not, are there any ideas in development (what stage)?  What are the main criteria for project selection. <br><br>  The first answer came from <a href="http://www.finam.ru/investments/projects00001/default.asp">Finam,</a> Leonid Delitsyn answered the questions. <br><br>  <i>(What is the share of the investor)</i> <br>  1. It depends on how much the author sells his share. <br><br>  Option 1 <br>  Ryaba laid a golden egg worth a hundred rubles.  Ryaba believes that he will carry nine hundred and ninety-nine more, but his grandfather (old and superstitious) only believes in nine.  Grandfather expects to earn five times more than invested.  He makes his hundred rubles.  Grandfather and Ryaba established a company where they have equal shares. <br><br>  Option 2 <br>  The grandmother believed that she, too, would carry an egg.  She sends her business plan to her grandfather: "since this stupid chicken lays golden eggs, then we will give birth to a golden hero with you."  The grandfather hires his grandmother to work for the soup, but the porridge, and they are taken to work.  The planned hero, however, will bear the surname of his grandfather and his middle name.  Thus, the proportion depends on the specific situation. <br><br>  <i>(What will happen to the share)</i> <br>  Obviously, if a grandfather sells a share to a grandmother, then a grandmother may require you to change Ryaba to a Harvard boy.  In this case we are talking about rowan posts.  But her _doll_ in the business is not going anywhere. <br><br>  <i>(Team and distance)</i> <br>  2. It depends on the history of the investor‚Äôs relationship with the ideologue and on the degree of remoteness.  Ryaba grandfather, maybe he will entrust a hundred rubles if he runs around his yard.  If a flock of unfamiliar geese with ideas flies by, then the grandfather may strongly prefer the office. <br><br>  <i>(Projects and Criteria)</i> <br>  3. There are running, and there are acquired projects, in various stages: <br>  <a href="http://www.finam.ru/investments/projects00001/default.asp">www.finam.ru/investments/projects00001/default.asp</a> <br><br>  To submit a project, you must fill out an application: <br>  <a href="http://www.finam.ru/investments/projects00002/default.asp">www.finam.ru/investments/projects00002/default.asp</a> <br><br>  The selection criteria are simple: our grandfather must believe that Ryaba was going to demolish, and how it benefits him.  The grandfather understands what an egg is, and why a golden egg is better than usual.  In addition, our division works only with ICT projects and does not consider projects from other areas. <br><br>  Then Roman Zolotarev from <a href="http://www.jumpidea.com/">JumpIDEA</a> answered the questions <a href="http://www.jumpidea.com/">.</a> <br><br>  1. Investor share 40% - 60%.  Other options are possible.  We plan to go out together with the founders. <br><br>  2. A team must be formed and everyone must be able to work remotely.  The team may be young, but everyone should have experience of remote collaboration.  There is no need to come to the office, we will meet in the Mass Start program. <br><br>  3. Projects have <a href="http://jumpidea.com/ru/projects">jumpidea.com/ru/projects</a> <br>  Criteria: 2-3 founders (web developers), web projects, simple idea, minimum functions, high speed of decision making and execution, proactivity. <br><br>  <a href="http://inventure.ru/">Inventure</a> Development <a href="http://inventure.ru/">Director</a> Dmitry Lyudmirsky replied that: <br>  ‚ÄúThere is no universal answer to your questions: everything depends on the specific idea, specific project and specific team with which you will come to us.‚Äù <br><br>  As expected, <a href="http://qd.ifmo.ru/">"QD"</a> does not have the finances, and help student teams begin development.  Answering these questions is not in their competence, much depends on the investor found. <br><br>  Still waiting for answers from other companies.  What thoughts, comrades? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/37454/">https://habr.com/ru/post/37454/</a></p>
