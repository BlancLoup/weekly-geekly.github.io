      Currently, Facebook is too frivolous about protecting my personal data.  According to the latest report of the company's security team, on Friday, 30 million people, including me, were hacked. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  "Attacking someone" is not known from where they could get access to the following information through my account: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ My name <br>  ‚Ä¢ My e-mail address <br>  ‚Ä¢ My mobile phone number <br>  ‚Ä¢ My date of birth <br>  ‚Ä¢ Marital status information <br>  ‚Ä¢ Where I come from <br>  ‚Ä¢ Where I live at the moment <br>  ‚Ä¢ Where I work <br>  ‚Ä¢ Where I went to school <br>  ‚Ä¢ 10 most visited places <br>  ‚Ä¢ 15 most searched queries on facebook <br>  ‚Ä¢ Entries in my tape <br>  ‚Ä¢ With whom I am friends <br>  ‚Ä¢ With whom I conduct private correspondence <br>  ‚Ä¢ Which groups are I a member of? <br><br>  Some may have come across something worse ‚Äî for example, if they shared information about their religion or something just as personal;  all users were subject to various levels of attacks.  It is difficult to estimate losses, quantitatively. <br><br>  Any account that uses my phone number to provide two-factor authentication is now compromised. <br><br>  My email address, which I use to log in to the system, too. <br>  I can quickly change any password, but switching to a new phone number, email address, or location is a more difficult case. <br><br>  I do not belong to overly sensitive people, but on facebook, there are some;  for example, there are <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/how-a-metoo-facebook-group-became-harassment-tool/">people who are victims of sexual violence, and those seeking support in special groups</a> , the disclosure of such personal information can be destructive. <br><br>  None of us can trust facebook anymore, but too late for that to matter. <br><br>  I poured data into this social network for more than ten years, expanding its understanding of Damon Beres (author of the article) and his friends gradually, day after day. <br><br>  Although users in some way are responsible for the information they provided on facebook - my hometown is in the hands of some hackers, because I typed ChicAgo into the text field many years ago - none of us suspected anything.  Like me, as a high school student, in 2005, the grandparents who subscribed to the service to see children's photos could not expect the social network to turn into an endless network of compromised data.  They also could not assume that the main functions of the website would be the ones who betrayed them. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe attackers used part of the friends lists of these 400,000 people to steal access tokens of about 30 million people,‚Äù he continued. <br><br>  In other words, every friendly connection added a new responsibility.  This is a trick that makes sense for those obsessed with technology in retrospect, but at the moment nothing can be done.  Facebook says it is working with the FBI to investigate the attack, and it is unclear whether we are expecting the worst to come.  We know that many of the data have been disclosed, but we still do not know what they are used for. <br><br>  Meanwhile, the officials who are charged with keeping the social network under control, basically failed to do something.  Facebook was the leader of the regulators, and no law anywhere in the world could possibly even come close to stopping its progress. <br><br>  US lawmakers were ignorant: remember how US senator Orrin Hatch asked Mark Zuckerberg in April at a Senate hearing about how the company makes money?  ‚ÄúSenator,‚Äù Zuckerberg replied, ‚Äúwe show ads.‚Äù <br><br>  Thus, we cannot push the genie back into the bottle, but the burden of responsibility undoubtedly lies on 1.47 billion of us who use Facebook daily. <br>  In several full-page newspaper ads that facebook published several months ago after a scandal in Cambridge Analytica, Zuckerberg makes the following promise: ‚ÄúWe are responsible for protecting your data, and if we cannot do this, then we do not deserve to serve you. <br><br>  ‚ÄúAfter I change my phone number and email address, Mark, I‚Äôll go about my business elsewhere. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/426365/">https://habr.com/ru/post/426365/</a></p>
