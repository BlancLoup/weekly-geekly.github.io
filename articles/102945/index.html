  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Joint software development order</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I want to share an idea and develop or reject it in the process of discussion. <br><br>  So, everyone knows joint procurement sites, when buyers drop off and buy a large batch of goods in bulk at a lower price.  At the same time, spending on the production of one unit of goods does not diminish in any way. <br><br>  In the world of information, everything is different.  I will say a commonplace, but when the cost of development is divided among many buyers, for each of them it reaches an acceptable level even for very complex software products (a copy of Windows 7 costs $ 100, the development cost billions). <br>  However, are all software needs satisfied with the market?  I am sure that despite the millions of programs, site engines and web services, not all.  If only because there is no clear feedback between the consumer and the developer.

      So what does a person do if he needs a program, a CMS, a script, a plugin or something like that? <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f27/048/e4e/f27048e4e8b5fc3c78150707b26c657f.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Those.  <b>if there is no suitable software, and the cost of its development is too high for the customer, we get a dead end, while it is quite common</b> .  We also get a dead end when there is software, but the copy price is unacceptable for the buyer, but this case is not interesting for us: usually the software pays off at least at the expense of dozens of buyers, and at most - millions.  We are <b>interested in the case when the price of software development is higher than the price that the client is ready to offer several times: 2-10</b> . <br><br><h4>  Service project </h4><br>  It is planned to create a site with the possibility of joint order.  The site contains a list of projects, as in the usual exchange of freelancers.  As in the ordinary exchange, there are customers and performers.  As in the usual exchange of freelancers, performers leave applications for the project, customers choose the contractor, enter into contracts, use SBS. <br><br>  The main difference: each project is <b>not one customer, but several</b> . <br>  Any customer creating a project sets the conditions for other customers to join it: <br>  - whether the payment is divided equally, or whether the entry into the project costs a fixed amount <br>  - whether the technical assignment is written jointly by all customers or only by the creator of the project. <br><br>  Accordingly, you can always join someone else's project, thereby dividing the investments, but receiving a copy of the resulting software, or you can create your own project and search for those who want to fold. <br><br><h5>  What is this scheme suitable for and what is not? </h5><br><br>  It is clear that the joint order scheme is <b>not suitable</b> for many of the freelancing ordered on the exchanges: <br>  - software developed for the purpose of sale (everything is clear here) <br>  - web design (because each site wants to look unique) <br>  - copywriting, rewriting (for the same reason, no one wants non-unique texts) <br>  - any services (as in different from the information, they can not be copied for free) <br><br>  What is it <b>suitable for</b> ? <br>  - software development <br>  - web scripts <br>  - plug-ins and modules to web scripts <br>  - plug-ins and software modules <br><br>  Who is the customer? <br>  1. Webmasters.  Since plug-ins to one or another engine and CMS often require the same many (for example, to integrate one engine with another), but they are not.  The cost of writing for an individual customer in this area is often acceptable, but often unacceptable. <br>  This also includes SEOs, moneymakers and others.  All of them often order scripts and software.  It is also often bought and sometimes sold. <br>  2. Small business.  Companies operating in specific areas of activity have specific software needs.  dissatisfied with the market due to the small number of potential buyers. <br>  3. Home users.  I am sure that there are tasks in which there is no adequate software, but a small number of people have a need.  These are usually applied tasks solved by a simple program or a plugin for a particular package. <br><br>  The main problem, in addition to the complexity of implementation in general, is a variety of customer requirements.  Those.  the organization of the preparation of TZ, which would suit all customers, is rather complicated.  The solution seems to be: <br><br>  The creator of the project lays out his TK.  Other customers wishing to join the project, may make the addition or exclusion of certain items from the TK a condition for their joining.  The creator of the project decides whether to accept their proposals or not. <br><br>  On this I would like to finish and give everyone the opportunity to discuss the idea. <br><br>  <i>PS As an offtopic, well, or an example, I will list the scripts I am ready to throw myself (or was ready some time ago, maybe now some of this has already been implemented):</i> <i><br></i> <ul><li>  Plugin for IPB for authorization via vkontakte API </li><li>  Cross-posting script in LiveJournal, twitter (with automatic link shortening), vkontakte, facebook: would be suitable for posting company news from the site </li><li>  Windows file search, as it was in XP.  In Vista / 7, I don‚Äôt like search, and Effective File Search is a bit buggy. </li><li>  The implementation of this exchange -) </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/102945/">https://habr.com/ru/post/102945/</a></p>
