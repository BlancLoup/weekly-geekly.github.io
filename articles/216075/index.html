  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Ubiquiti UniFi firmware recovery history on AP Long Range and Outdoor</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Good afternoon, dear readers, I decided to share my impressions on the restoration of firmware wifi outlets of the company UBNT.  The story began with the fact that they decided to try to put in parallel a new beta controller of the 3rd version.  Everything was going well, the controller asked for permission to connect the point that he found, we answered yes - we connected-everything is ok.  And they left it for some time, the next day they began to notice that we have lost points from the old controller and they do not ask about the connection on the new one.  They were neither on the old nor on the new controller.  For the sake of saving the rest, we turned off the new controller, removed the dead spots.  It turned out they did not want to receive IP via DHCP, they did not have a MAC address, and the default address 192.168.1.20 also did not respond to ping when connected to a computer.  Reset pressed and 30 seconds, and a minute, and two, and when loading the point, the reset did not occur, in short a full out. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Then we found the recovery instructions on the Internet: <br>  1) <a href="http://shop.nag.ru/article/vosstanovlenie-programmnogo-obespecheniya-tochki-dostupa-unifi">UniFi Access Point Software Recovery</a> <br>  2) <a href="http://www.sanotes.org.ua/tag/dd-wrt/">Restoring the standard UniFi AP firmware after DD-WRT</a> . <br><br>  <a href="http://shop.nag.ru/catalog/00007.Avtomatizatsiya-i-monitoring/06120.Konvertery-interfejsov/09686.USB2UART-10">We bought "Interface Converter USB and UART" in the magician.</a>  <a href="http://shop.nag.ru/catalog/00007.Avtomatizatsiya-i-monitoring/06120.Konvertery-interfejsov/09686.USB2UART-10">"NAG"</a>

      The jumper (wiring) for the USB connection and the pins on the UBNT board used that tore from the old computers (the power, reset, HDD buttons), twisted them together and wound them with electrical tape.  It is enough to connect three pins on the board point with three pins on the USB. <br><br>  Next, disassembled hull points.  AP-LR figured out easily, but at AP-Outdoor I had to think a little about how to disassemble it.  It turns out you need to unscrew the golden washers that are on the antennas, and unscrew the bolts that go under the sticker with the MAC address.  Then the board is simply pulled out of the case.  It is a pity here that it is problematic to insert pictures, so I would share the pictures and how I connected them, and how I disassembled them. <br><br>  I connected everything as per instructions.  The switching scheme is as follows: RXD adapter - SOUT point;  TXD adapter - SIN dot;  GND adapter - GND point.  On the AP board, one of the pins is as if circled in a box separately - this is 3.3 volt, which we do not use.  This is me to the fact that AP-LR has everything signed on the board, but AP-Outdoor does not.  But it doesn't matter if you take the AP-Outdoor board with the antennas to the top, the pins over you, and the RG45 downwards - then the order is from top to bottom: GND-Rx-Sin-3.3v.  I just got it mixed up and putty seemed to connect with me, but I could not enter commands. <br><br>  Next, I downloaded the TFTP client "3CDaemon".  <a href="http://www.ubnt.com/eula/%3FBACK%3D/downloads/unifi/2.3.9/airos2unifi.bin">I downloaded the firmware</a> and installed on the computer IP 192.168.1.254 a mask 255.255.255.0 gateway 192.168.1.20. <br><br>  A few words about the firmware.  Everyone in the instructions wrote that we were taking the firmware from the controller downloaded from the ubnt site or from our installed one.  I had to download the controller, install and pick up from the folders or from my controller, but alas, oddly enough, none.  Tech support ubnt tugged snowstorm, although clearly written, give the firmware for these points.  Thanks to the user YuryD from the forum "Nag" shared a link to the firmware, and went to both types of points. <br><br>  Well, then as per the instructions, we start Putty by setting the speed settings to 115200, the rest of the parameters are set by default.  My only COM3 port was instead of the first one.  We connect and when the point is restarted (I just inserted and removed rj45), press any key, I pressed a lot and often a space while in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Net inscription, I did not see the following there: <br><br>  ar7240&gt; <br><br>  If you don‚Äôt see the inscriptions or can‚Äôt enter anything, or the letters are quasi-like, most likely they have mixed up the pins in the RX TX places - just swap them. <br>  This is a mode for entering commands, all available commands can be displayed via help.  But we don‚Äôt need anything special, since the default point is ip 192.168.1.20 and refers to the default tftp 192.168.1.254.  And we have already set it up and we have a vitukha already turned on in the computer, so we immediately start the command <br><br>  ar7240&gt; urescue <br><br>  There will be something like wait for the connection.  We press the Go button in our tftp client and the firmware is freely downloaded.  It remains to wait for three minutes, you can put a ping from your computer to 192.168.1.20.  the dot begins to respond to ping  Well, then everything is the same way, we catch it to our controller, it is updated and offers to take it to us and we press Adopting as always. <br><br>  That's the end of the story.  The article before everything was written not as an instruction, but as with what can be encountered, that is, additions to already existing instructions.  That is, not properly connected contacts, left-handed firmware - for me personally created a lot of problems and loss of time.  I hope she will help someone.  Restored a couple of AP-LR and six pieces of Outdoor <habracut></habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/216075/">https://habr.com/ru/post/216075/</a></p>
