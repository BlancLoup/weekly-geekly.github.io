Either transfer the old to a new motive, or the next part is designed to bring the game back to life.  One could say "but in our time we live with realities ..." and lie.  Because there is no "our time" in relation to the concept of the market.  True time is, but the market is timeless.  It existed long before us, long before minting coins and the appearance of banknotes.  He will exist after.  Not forever, but until one person remains on Earth.  Two - can already "push" each other, both speech and things. <br><br>  I would like to touch on the ‚Äúrevival of the brand‚Äù, in the context of banal speculation on the feelings of the players.  Often it looks like a marketing ploy that imitates the attention of publishers and developers to the story, the feelings of the players, to the old generation.  In fact, this is an attempt to reach as large a market as possible.  Starting with nostalgic old men and ending with a modern player.  Does this assumption have a grain of truth, or is this another of my conspiracy theories?

      Does Flashback say anything to you?  Chaos Engine? <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Some thoughts, stories and flashback </h4><br>  New in this particular case has never been forgotten old.  Just a wrap from it.  Title.  The symbol of past years.  When we are told ‚Äú <a href="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tag/flashback/">we will make a new Flashback</a> ‚Äù someone claps their hands, someone curses with irritation.  I perceive such moves as Falseback.  Not surprising, because I Bruise.  For me, there are no ‚Äúresurgent legends‚Äù.  All the legends as it should be - remained in antiquity.  Now there are a lot of good games around, but these are the children of the Titans. <br><br>  Nevertheless, for the time being I have enough brains not waving the ‚ÄúBut earlier!‚Äù Flag much.  Because I understand that my assessment may not be adequate.  I see the new against the old.  I see and analyze today's games by the criteria of old games.  This is true from my point of view, and from the point of view of those who bring the banners of the industry back into the past, developing ancestral style games. <br>  Somehow it even happened that this revival became mainstream.  The story went on the reverse round.  It turns out that I can say "rejoice that at least the old names do not forget," "rejoice that they do something at all" and that someone will be right.  Did she go to reverse?  Is he this?  Or skillfully created illusion warmed up by events raging on Kickstarter?  And are not these two turns, one of which is an attempt to go to the sources, and the second is not even a curve, but just a straight line - from A to B, where B is just money. <br><br>  After all, if you think in terms of a modern player, any game is just a new game.  Old flashback or new flashback, what's the difference?  Another new game, another new world, which he did not see.  For him, this is not ‚ÄúBum-Bam-Flashback!‚Äù, And not ‚Äúthe same taste‚Äù as for me, but an arcade in the Si-Fi setting with good effects.  No more. <br>  He had no need to know that this name was a cult for many people and had a special meaning.  Simply enough the term - "cult", or "on the basis of the cult."  He does not need to know about the movement controller, which was used in the game and which was ‚Äúlit up‚Äù only in a number of products of that time.  About <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A0%25D0%25BE%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B8%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5">rotoscoping</a> technology that made the animation surprisingly smooth back in 1950.  Remember "Scarlet Flower"?  And his surprisingly smooth animation is not inferior to Disney? <br>  He does not need to know that this type of controller is dangerous for the game developer of today.  He is slow.  Needless to be tactful (not in terms of, ‚Äúsorry, sorry, but can I sit down?‚Äù But from the point of view of the dynamics of the gameplay, which more often resembles tactics, rather than an arcade).  In some ways it even resembles chess.  Although, how is chess now?  Everything must fly, sparkle and explode. <br><br>  I, of course, would have said nothing in a rag and continued to crawl quietly, barely audible rustling sheets in the best worlds, but the appearance of the trailer marked the "restart" of the brand <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chaos_Engine">Chaos Engine</a> caused fear.  As a true grouch I cried, "Until?"  Well, is it really necessary to take out all the classics?  In all run their elbows planted with dollars hands? ‚Äù. <br>  After a moment, I, of course, calmed down and called the mind to the rescue, which cooled the insane gyrus and gave me back the clarity of consciousness.  But ... a nervous trembling of the eyelids and a bitterly twisted mouth prompted me that the topic was sick.  That I'm addicted to her.  Is sick.  Heavily.  Progressive rejection of the fourth stage canvas today, complicated by the ‚Äúrevival syndrome‚Äù. <br><br><h4>  Ubisoft black archaeologists excavated Flashback </h4><br>  In addition to those who sacredly honor the game history, and for whom the finds are something, then they are shown in museums and the development of their versions of the past on the basis of relics is the norm, there are those who dig the dust of the departed solely for profit.  It always has been.  In all ages. <br>  Restarting the legendary brand promises no small profits, even if the game does not need the cake.  Sweet and smiling confectioners from EA and Ubisoft will tell you about the ‚Äúrevival of the legend‚Äù, about the art of pastors and the recipe that they managed to find.  Cover the cake with imitation vanilla rust, sugar corrosion and aging jam.  The presentation of the very same cake will be held under the hooting of young people and the sweet crying of specially invited eminent old men.  All this will be duly recorded by the relevant information resources.  Almost idyll. <br><br>  Except that, under the gloss of imitation of antiquity, another brilliant shader, a meaningless, but ugly showy clone of a clone, will be born.  And with the only reservation that on board will be flaunted label "Son of the Legend". <br><br>  Old men, tell me, please, can Conrad have such an intelligent face?  Is this really an employee of the Galactic Bureau of Investigation? <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/_W_tRZwpSYk%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhSxXqrns_fgGUwBizzaTihMlyJww" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Saints, gluttons, is this what the hero of the best-selling game in the history of the French gaming industry should look like?  If it is 3D, why is that?  Is this bam-bum-bam firework of explosions in the trailer, flashes and jumps - intellectual, tactical and adventure platformer Flashback?  Holi Molly!  I am ready to admit that I am an old fart, the most mediocre and miserable implementation of cubic babies, but this is not our Flashback. <br>  Why this camera shake?  For more dynamism?  Facial rich face - for drama?  And what, to create the dynamics and drama more ways there?  Sorry, but such hypertrophied facial expressions were experienced by heroes back in the year 2001, that is ... 12 years ago.  In <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_Tactics:_Brotherhood_of_Steel">Fallout Tactics</a> .  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3Dk2qeGcSCI-0%26list%3DPLD27C539218E5ADA6">Remember the recruitment briefing</a> ?  These hypertrophied movements of eyebrows, widening eyes, making them look like madmen.  And to be honest, they look almost more fun than Conrad.  More fun in the sense of better.  How can you strike the minds of modern players with such a "classic"?  Why is the real classic ignored?  Excellent animation?  Amazing videos?  The work of artists on the backgrounds?  Where are the other components of our star minus the name? <br><br>  In my understanding, if you really took to follow the canons, called yourself a person or a team that makes a remake of a cult game, then do it accordingly.  Even a fan is able to create a style better than our exhumer friends did.  Please pay attention: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d1b/92d/ee5/d1b92dee50049c8fd288b9b35c4c3766.jpg"><br>  Work author: J. Pilongery (AKA <a href="http://tetedebug.deviantart.com/">TetedeBUG</a> ) <br>  Link to image: <a href="http://tetedebug.deviantart.com/art/Flashback-HD-306607791">link</a> <br><br>  I do not think this style is the best, but it is definitely more sensual than the cardboard I see in the video.  It has a spirit.  Emotions.  In the video I see only balloons, of which there are many.  In the video - just a game.  No claims and the name of such games - legion.  And if no one called her a remake, then as a separate and independent game, she would have passed without any notice at all.  But as a flashback, she is the same Back as I am a Shaolin monk. <br><br>  What is quite funny and illustrative FlashBack caused a stir not only among mere mortals, one of the recognized masters of concept art <a href="http://www.sidequesting.com/2013/01/artist-reimagines-flashback-with-hd-painted-visuals-in-2-5d/">Feng Zhu</a> also devoted to this time creating a video tutorial where he creates his version of the game's appearance.  I think that to a certain extent it was not only the personal vision of the new Flashback, but also an advertisement for his school.  Despite the fact that he himself doesn‚Äôt need any advertising, you need to promote the business and show everyone every day how cool you are.  Otherwise, they will forget about you.  Tested by time.  Thought it might be ... it would be fun to do something like that.  Although ... I already did something similar for <a href="http://lionwood-studios.com/special_for_brian_fargo.html">Wasteland 2</a> and I remember well how it ended.  Nothing. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c28/05f/701/c2805f7010af2f4254c23d50e18bcf8e.jpg"><br><br>  Even the reissue of Another World ( <a href="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2013/04/05/gaming-made-me-another-world/">Another World's 20th Anniversary Edition</a> ) was gentle and quivering, I suppose because they were afraid to spoil the inner thing that the game carried.  They acted wisely - they slightly modified the backgrounds (in my opinion, in many places, worsening them) and left the mechanics as they were, only by alleviating difficult game play moments (which, by the way, is also very vain).  Not familiar - be sure to try.  Rate it.  This is a rare <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/233550/">bouquet of one of the best French wines</a> of the 1991 sample. <br><br>  What do I as a player say about the fact that Paul Cuisset, the developer of the original Flashback, participates in the development of the ‚Äúcontinuation‚Äù?  As a consumer, to me, the names are not important, but the affairs of famous people.  Where did they all go? <br>  I bet that they are not driven by the desire to introduce the modern player to the classics.  Make a new, popular and well-selling product - yes.  This is what everyone wants.  But in the same way, yes - to do all this at the expense of the name to the project which has no special relation  Any other project could be the same Flashback.  Including Half-life.  Why?  The plot is almost the same.  Land.  Aliens.  Well, not an agent of national security, but also very daring Gordon.  We change the name to Conrad and the business chamber.  If someone doesn‚Äôt have a business, you just need to get past luck out of your pocket.  Recall Brian Fargo and Wasteland 2. First, he took out of the dampers, then the new Torment and God knows what else it will surprise.  True, so far, without impressive results, at the level of words. <br><br>  By the way, if it‚Äôs customary to play with a spatula (it‚Äôs not all the same to spray emotions), then it turns out that the organization that funded Flashback Origins became <a href="http://cnc.fr/">CNC</a> (Center national du cin√©ma et de l'image anim√©e), in my free translation, the National Center for Cinematography and Animation .  The project has been allocated 300,000 euros.  A dry, but very eloquent line reads about this ( <a href="http://cnc.fr/web/fr/7-novembre-2011">somewhere at the very bottom of this form</a> ).  Nevertheless, the trailer is emblazoned with Ubisoft.  Where the fat - there and kazual. <br>  Remember FarCry 3, where the hunt for an animal turned into a movement on the marker to the target.  Only a round idiot glancing at the map will not understand that we have crocodiles here, and here we should look for tigers.  I believe that in Ubisoft they believe that we will not be able to go through the game in two steps.  Therefore, they drag us by the marker, if they return to the point, and indicate where on the map you can find each particular animal.  It does not seem to think at all.  Similarly, apparently, they thought in Rockstar, believing that a Max Payne 3 player would be painfully hard to face a dilemma - how to get through a corridor with a column.  To her left, or to her right.  These were one of the most complex in topology levels.  "Pipes with columns".  So keep the industry!  Tomorrow we will become even smarter. <br><br>  French network sources reported: <br>  <i>‚Äú... Comme dans la version originale, au gr√© des combats, des tirs et des cascades, Conrad devra sauver le monde ... et sa petite amie.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>On the nous prometre que l'on retrouvera tout ce que nous avions tantas dans ce l√©n√©√© du cere nous 90, mis au got du jour gr√Écece a la technologie du 21√®me si√®cle ... "</i> <br><br>  I am sure that there will be sensible people at Habr√© who can translate French press releases to us more precisely, but it seems to me that here we are talking about returning what was considered a classic to the 90s in the frame of modern technologies.  If the classic in modern design and modern technology looks like in the video, then ... I'm not a monk, but already the superior of the monastery of modern technology. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/68f/e67/46c/68fe6746c7a4b3c0cfe386bfaf951800.jpg"><br><br>  If the old games look so good because the developers of that time did not have modern technologies, then I am happy that I lived at that time and I still remember it.  From the point of view of the artistic component, those backgrounds and those heroes were an order of magnitude nicer and more humane than these blanks.  Let's not build illusions on the basis of one game play video (and what else can you do?) And look at the thundering sequels of other famous games.  Very famous.  Oh, very. <br><br><h4>  Maxim machine gun </h4><br>  We'll get another person involved on the scene, since we hit him higher.  Zdras-sste.  Glad to see, and by the way, Maxim - you're wrong.  Although not Max is not right, of course, but the Hauser brothers.  If they did everything perfectly with the GTA and Red Dead Redemption series, in the case of Max Payne 3, the anger of the fans is understandable - you didn‚Äôt have to turn the game into a GTA cut-scene collection on the engine.  Sometimes it seems that the animations from the GTA were simply taken, and Maxa and other characters of the third part were dressed on top of them.  The difference is, in general, no.  San Andreas. <br><br>  Almost every scene where the action takes place - has an insert-video, where we are shown and told something.  After this scene, we are usually either run or thrown into a narrow and narrow micro-level aquarium, where we survive to meet a new cut-scene.  Nobody talks about freedom.  About freedom of movement, too.  You are tightly boarded up in a blockbuster bobsleigh, where only a moan that can be heard through the body of a rushing down coffin with the remains of a very good game can break through lips pierced with nails. <br><br>  You can accuse me of excessive emotionality and excessive, fabricated claims.  But even as a coffee serving assistant to a junior game designer, I clearly see that a number of serious mistakes were made.  Starting from the "not reset rollers", and ending with the entry points to the game level, where at a high level of complexity they kill you a few seconds after landing.  You can not clamp the player so that he is given only one way and this way forward without the possibility of moving backwards or sideways, where the doors are tightly closed behind your back.  This is not a modern action game, this is some kind of Call of Duty, in which, when trying to open doors at the beginning of the game, we were at least written ‚Äúdo not try to open the doors, we will not open them, and all that needs to be opened will be itself‚Äù.  This, at least it was honest.  Strange, wild, but honest.  Here we had another ‚Äúrevival of the legend‚Äù with a good plot, a hero and a nasty realization.  Add tunnel syndrome, aggravated by cantilever sores and regular GTA-flashbacks and we get a hero who is not firmly on his feet, and the charlatan created is not clear why.  Well ... excluding earnings.  The game has zero potential for re-passing, scripts more than in both parts of the game, the scripts do not have a detour, and there is no way not to enjoy the screen savers for the hundredth time (this was at the time of release and within a month after it, I did not run this game and did not follow her). <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/W1ZtBCpo0eU%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhq3chaVz60ufZGBHZ-44z-U1OWkQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DW1ZtBCpo0eU%26feature%3Dplayer_embedded">www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1ZtBCpo0eU&amp;feature=player_embedded</a> <br><br>  When I saw this video, at the end of 2011 - I cried.  I choked on laughter just like when I saw <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Neverhood">The Neverhood</a> for the first time.  But unlike the latter, the laughter was bitter too.  Despite the exaggeration - all this is the reality of today's games.  They are.  And how can you talk about remakes and the following parts of the games "preserving the atmosphere", where you can‚Äôt take a step without tutorial, intrusive help and universal freedom restrictions?  Saw cell equipment in Deus Ex: Human Revolution - went drunk to the nearest bar and cried for a long time, hugging and remembering the games of the past days, thanked for the crumbs that the game industry returned to us?  What thank you for talking?  Because we were robbed to the skin, and now we have returned the button so that the pants do not fall? <br>  And this is not a reproach, do not misunderstand.  Movie well filed emotions.  Showed what has accumulated.  Long.  And then what is the outcome.  To crush your line, uphold a deliberately doomed business and be true to yourself, games and players, you need to give a lot of strength and nerves.  It is much easier to slip and start doing what brings money, but does not bring satisfaction.  After all, everyone wants to eat, is not it?  And who will support in the right movement, even if it is not correct?  In words - every mountain.  But in fact, everyone has their own business, much more important than toys. <br><br>  As a player, I am very sorry that Remedy had to give Rockstar to Max Payne.  But I am very glad that they are alive, good health, that we have Alan, and that we will have other games from Remedy not connected with the work of the Hauser brothers ( <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A5%25D0%25B0%25D1%2583%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580,_%25D0%2594%25D1%258D%25D0%25BD">Dan</a> and <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A5%25D0%25B0%25D1%2583%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580,_%25D0%25A1%25D1%258D%25D0%25BC">Sam</a> ).  Being indignant to the depths of my soul, I drew this little cartoon.  Sam Lake ... no one will ever play max better than you.  The outrage was so strong that I even sat down to make a mod for the second part of the game, instead of engaging in my own projects.  How could they say - torknulo. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/93d/ef7/d03/93def7d03244dece293bac0ecfd82b3b.jpg"><br>  <i>As Max Payne (left and right), I am more impressed by Sam Lake (right).</i>  <i>His photo was taken from his last interview, which he gave during the release of the game Alan Wake.</i> <br><br>  I believe that everyone should do what he does best.  And I also think that it is impossible to experiment so unceremoniously with the classics.  Not because it is impossible, but because it is stupid.  If I take my face and in Photoshop I will stretch over Mona Lisa, I will not become a brilliant artist, modernist and God knows who else.  No ... I will be an ordinary mu ... mucacho ... some kind of eccentric, nothing but a defiant battle.  And okay if the crank just entertains the public.  Here is a product that continues the legendary series.  Signed project.  Sign people.  Sign company.  They undertook to administer the legend.  And yes.  I believe that the series is legendary.  For different reasons.  But there is no need for a blacksmith to sew clothes.  You just need to call a tailor.  There are studios that do certain things well, and there‚Äôs nothing wrong with that. <br><br>  And if the ‚Äúnew look‚Äù from RockStar on Max Payne‚Äôs story, and the new part of the legendary game is running around the neutered GTA-locations driven by Dan Hauser‚Äôs screenwriting genius, then I ... well, you remember.  As a script, the game is not bad at all, I must admit.  Generally a drunken hero, for painkillers ... this is a good move.  Transformation into a drug addict, a person dependent on alcohol and painkillers.  A good house turns out.  At least it's an interesting twist.  But the overall implementation with such a large number of ultra-content, with a good budget - just the seams. <br>  This is not max.  Bruce Williss - maybe.  But not Max.  This is not the kind of game RockStar would be worth doing.  Or rather ... to be honest.  This is the game, and even the cake, but not with this name.  Do not do something that you do not know how.  Although‚Ä¶ <br><br>  Although I would love to look at the airborne simulator or quest for their authorship.  Why be shy then?  And some kazualochku.  Find on the screen 20 corpses, look for 40 bags of cocaine ... a popular thing would have turned out a thing.  And most importantly - the mainstream. <br><br>  The previous example of the papa game (Flashback) got into the Guinness Book of Records, and the previous ... papa-max is our PKshnaya matrix, a fantastic action project in scope, in the number of slow-moving bullets, in the turns of the camera around the hero, in sharp and capacious texts, in inflame passions and emotions.  What the hell, people, this is our Max.  Pick up all the awards that were possible and who took the main prize - our eternal love. <br><br>  Legs and hands, modern 3D-Action games have grown from daddies, and not vice versa.  Daddies, by the way, had grandfathers, not less steep peppers, but not about them.  He mentioned that no one would think that I forgot about them. <br><br>  Let's beat someone else?  For example Redechku?  <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gearbox_Software">Randy Pichford</a> .  Think not at all?  And we will find.  And without difficulty. <br><br><h4>  What are you doing Randy? </h4><br>  I can be brief.  I do not know how, but here I will succeed.  You will see. <br><br>  <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_Nukem_Forever">Duke Nukem Forever</a> . <br><br>  Everything.  I can finish this section.  I won‚Äôt even wonder what kind of idea I‚Äôve got to put the unfortunate long-term construction company on the unhappy GearBox, thereby spoiling their reputation.  I will not even try to guess what kind of publishing head the thought came about that it was necessary to restart the legendary (oh yes, again legendary) brand.  And what heads did the thought come to you that the GearBox is now the perfect scavenger, cleaner, who will ‚Äúclean up your game‚Äù?  Those interested can recall the shooter "Collonial Marines" if you wish.  I have no such desire today. <br><br>  And, by the way, there is a version that I generate conspiracy theories.  How paranoid.  I do not want to upset those who ascribe to me excessive suspiciousness, but in our industry there really are "sex, lies, and video".  In other words, lies, fraud and fraud, and much more.  No need to be a rocket scientist to see this.  For those who are blind, there is evidence, including video.  I do not mean cheap filming anyone, anywhere, with someone cramming something into himself. <br><br>  Why did I remember this?  Because Randy Pichford was at the center of two such scandals.  With two games Collonial Marines and Duke Nukem Forever.  It's a pity.  Man in many ways causing sympathy.  Yes, and his office has released a number of very good products.  But people are usually judged by spots on their clothes.  Saw - and carried on the world to lead. <br>  Not that I justified him, but I think there are people in any good conspiracy theory even higher than Randy.  They make decisions.  There is always money and power.  Everywhere.  And everywhere these two act the same.  Everywhere the top where the threads are drawn is not too noticeable.  And due to the unchanging human nature it is quite logical to assume the most characteristic behavior for a person. <br><br><h4>  Correct continuation </h4><br>  I do not exaggerate.  There is a fair amount of good sequels and good reymeyk.  But who would know that in his youth, John Connor was a pathetic drug addict and a whiner?  No one would have known if it were not for the third part of the film.  One worthy and bright spot in it was <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A8%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D1%2586%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580,_%25D0%2590%25D1%2580%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25B4">grandfather Schwarzkopff</a> .  And then, a number of gorgeous scenes with his participation (I must say, very successful) were cut out.  But <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DkayFrIR-Qfw">this scene</a> is almost the best movie ever.  It's funny that at one time his hero from the movie <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Action_Hero">Last Action Hero was</a> constantly compared with Konrad from FlashBack.  This is due to the <a href="">similar color of clothes</a> . <br><br>  Nevertheless, there are enough worthy sequels.  Those who decided to abandon the "help of publishers" in the development of games relying only on our strengths and shoulders add fuel to the fire.  Well yes.  On ours, and on whose else?  Literally in a few weeks you will meet our popular game <a href="http://harebrained-schemes.com/shadowrun/">Shadowrun Returns</a> (or rather, it will appear on Steam on July 25 and you can already <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/234650">pre-order it</a> ). <br>  And why does even one movie with their alpha version touch me more than a new Flashback teaser?  Probably because of the godless isometry to which I have extreme weakness?  Or maybe this is the skill of artists who, instead of 3D, decided to do as before - beautifully and with a soul?  No ... this, resolutely, cannot be.  Why draw if there is a nekst gene? <br><br>  Those who are left behind, bit the bit of resentment, heavyweights, publishers still strike back.  Throwing on the market "fake continuation" the entire duration of which will be reduced to the familiar wrapper from childhood.  And that characteristically succeed in this.  In this world there are such mammoths as Ubisoft, EA, and ZeniMax.  It would be naive to assume that they are offended by something, and that they bit the bit, probably they feel what is happening just as a person feels a mosquito bite.  But this is not very pleasant.  And the mosquito buzzes.  And the city mosquito is harder to beat.  He is not as stupid as his country variety, always drunk with blood. <br>  But what would really be naive is to believe that they will accept the loss of a part of the market selected (or selected at the moment) by impudent rebels.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Why fight with resistance, if you can wear his mask and reap money in two fronts? And then again push out? After all, if you give the players something ‚Äúold‚Äù that they want, and then increase the production volumes and the quality of individual components, you can push back the insidious indie, because videos, voice acting and technology are expensive. And ... no one will lose, which is typical. All repeat again, although probably not very soon. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And fat and skinny will regularly enrich us with all sorts of products. Giving us what we lacked. Diversity.</font></font><br><br><h4>  Summary </h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But if you go back to the fatties and their reasons? Is there a reverent attitude to the sources? The desire to return to the world of the classics of the gaming industry, or just a thirst for profit? You know the answer. No worse than me. Your heart will not allow you to be deceived. Your heart will not allow reason to find arguments in support of these "successfully revived" brands. Because most of you are at least familiar with Duke and Max. You still remember what they were. And this ... does not make you old. That was good recently. What, for the company, does not allow to write off to scrap and me.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">So what do we have? Speculation on our feelings or something else? Doesn't the experience of humanity and market relations tell you that we are simply trying to push something, and not to sell a quality product? Are we so lowered as players that we will rejoice at every opportunity to hear the old name and passionately nostalgic about it in the nearest tavern?</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And what awaits us next? Maybe troubled times? Now moving in unison with Kistarter parties, exhumation brigades from the world of big industry are already working. Major publishers smell the smell of dead flesh, which is again in price. This is not about zombie projects that have regained popularity, but about a wave of ‚Äúrevivals‚Äù and remakes that fill the market, mixing with real revivals. This is already happening, don't you notice? Only the lazy one does not say that now he will do as before, that he is now working on a new adaptation of the old game, that he is now rethinking some old concepts.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In today's day, every month we will experience allegiance to traditions and speculate on our love. This is the trend. You can argue as much as you like, but the day is not complete without a phrase about ‚ÄúN, the spiritual successor of Y, came out on Kickstarter.‚Äù This phrase from the news has already turned into stamping. And it is not known how many impostors are hidden under these N. And here - nothing can be done. You can either trust some developer - or not. In the case of Kickstarter and indie projects. And in the case of EA, Zenimax and Ubisoft hope that the next 10 years they will not stupid us even more. Hope dies last, hope for God and do not blame yourself, bla-bla-bla ... </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Hear the hiss?

Will we save it? We learn. It is, by the way, the very ‚Äúbitmaps‚Äù who presented such games to the world as - Xenon II: Megablast, Cadaver, Gods, Chaos Engine, Z. When you think about such giants, you immediately remember the Maya Indians. There were almost disappeared - a fact. But their creativity and architecture still stand. It still amazes with its scope.</font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/75c/2d1/7ab/75c2d17ab9a4dd9f86554a37ca354eb7.jpg"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Sign team, landmark projects. Not like of course, the fact that they go below, but ... to tell the truth, where does the developer now take a sane project in the portfolio? What to brag about? Ten kazualok? Sotsialok? Games have not been done for a long time (easy exaggeration), and if they do it only complete psychos or rich people. The rest have to survive. Here at least survived the case. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The trailer is not a trailer. There's nothing. There are only tenacious fingers of invisible puppeteers who are already playing on the strings of your souls. Most of us players will give away the last pennies for the new Deus Ex, Commandos, Jagged Alliance, and Fallout. Many are ready to give the gaming devil their immortal gaming souls, drawing a nickname on the hellish contract, in the event that he returns the Thief himself or the Foul.</font></font><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/mXJKr_BP4vc%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgDGZMzJECljpL9ICXmuUWiBGvDXA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">What will this project bring? </font></font><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devolver_Digital"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Devolver Digital, the</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> developers of the new Chaos Engine have behind them quite loud names by today's standards. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Serious Sam 3: BFE, Hotline Miami, Duke Nukem 3D: Megaton Edition and Shadow Warrior. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Wait a moment to rejoice. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This is not the </font></font><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_Warrior"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Shadow Warrior</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> , but another remake. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Yes ... a remake of the very same. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And they too. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The official ‚Äúpatron‚Äù behind the studio‚Äôs back is unknown, there are no frankly thick ones on the horizon ...

Give strength where there are no more.  Belief in your dream.  And movement to her.  All the rest is extra stimulation.  But the believer goes and goes where there is no way out.  Or die.  But with faith.  In a bright future.  To the best part.  In that all this was not in vain. <br>  I've been fussing about for three years now.  I'm trying to do so so that I was not ashamed to look in the mirror.  Covered all his projects and left one.  He absolutely does not make money.  This is a 100% loss at this stage.  Tons of time.  Nerves.  Forces.  Situations where you have to painfully choose between family and work, but ... this is the very path to the dream.  I am not cunning with me.  And I know what I'm doing for gamers, which I would be glad of myself. <br><br>  And no, and there will be no other ways.  As with raising children - only with your own damn example.  It makes no sense to talk about the dangers of smoking with a pipe in his teeth.  Similarly, in the industry - it makes no sense to say.  This publication does not carry decisions and answers.  These are thoughts, statements, some analysis, but not a solution to the problem.  It could be if I would have weight in our fraternity.  Would have projects that could be proud of.  I don't have them.  Only a set of knowledge, skills, something of their own. <br>  True publication may pursue other goals.  In this raging sea, on other ships, just like on my ship, lights are on, and I see them when the tide raises me high enough.  It will be easier for them when they know that they are not alone, that someone, too, stubbornly swims forward.  And it will be easier for me ... too.  Because I will know too. <br>  <i><b>The fourth - comparative</b> - in the article as examples of remakes and sequels are examples of unsuccessful game projects.</i>  <i>A rating, or an assessment of their failure, is a complex picture formed by several factors at once.</i>  <i>This is the opinion of the players themselves, the opinion of the press at the time of release, opinions about the game before the release, and after, the rating of sales.</i>  <i>Rating is a subjective concept.</i>  <i>Even if the game was not accepted by critics and did not bring income - it can be good.</i>  <i>Exactly the opposite - the game could be well received in the press, it could bring income, but from the point of view of the response of the players it turned out to be mediocre and this did not give the game a long life.</i>  <i>A simple example is the bread that you eat.</i>  <i>He is the leader.</i>  <i>Thousands of tons of products are sold every day.</i>  <i>There is a popular opinion ‚Äúbread is the head of everything‚Äù, but no one talks about the quality of present bread, but, alas, it is not high.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>In this example, we have an illustration of the subjectivity of ratings.</i>  <i>Each player one way or another belongs to any denomination, has its own views and tastes.</i>  <i>Expressing a point of view about a particular game, I try to avoid a dialogue about taste preferences.</i>  <i>But even in the case of technical analysis of the components of the game - I can not be impartial, like any other person.</i>  <i>This does not mean that I impose my opinion on you - this means that I state my point of view.</i>  <i>I will not argue about the taste of a hamburger and a sausage sandwich, and I won‚Äôt find out which one is better.</i>  <i>Let everyone decide for himself.</i>  <i>Nevertheless, I reserve the right to comment and evaluate those components of games for which I have the relevant knowledge (according to my specialization).</i>  <i>You can challenge my comments and ratings.</i>  <i>But not from the point of view of the subjective ‚Äúyes, it‚Äôs all a mess‚Äù (which often happens), but with the same profile data.</i>  <i>In other words, not from a position of taste, but from a position of specialization.</i>  <i>If necessary, we can enter into a graphic duel, defending one or another argument, this or that technological solution, this or that piece of content, or the image as a whole.</i>  <i>I‚Äôm not afraid to screw it up in public - there‚Äôs not a lot of shame.</i>  <i>Shame - just chatting without knowing anything.</i> <br>  <i><b>Fifth - oskominnaya</b> - Enough to generate and fabricate speculation about my addiction to pixel art and two-dimensional graphics.</i>  <i>You as well as I can love hamburgers, but at the same time you do not deny the existence of a sandwich with sausage.</i>  <i>Similarly, I do not deny the existence and use of three-dimensional graphics in addition to two-dimensional.</i>  <i>This is all food.</i>  <i>In the context of 2D and 3D graphics, these are tools.</i>  <i>I will never say that a jigsaw or hammer is bad.</i>  <i>Bad can only be his hand.</i>  <i>Therefore‚Ä¶</i> <i><br></i>  <i>‚Ä¶ I repeat.</i>  <i>I am not saying anywhere that you need to get everything back to normal and to make it so that we live in the world of pixel art.</i>  <i>I say something else - let there be many games - good and different.</i>  <i>And I also say that both two-dimensional and three-dimensional graphics can be poorly used.</i>  <i>And when I say this about three-dimensional graphics, this only means that this particular three-dimensional graphics - is done poorly.</i>  <i>No more and no less.</i>  <i>The same situation is equivalent to two-dimensional graphics.</i>  <i>Stop putting convenient labels on people.</i>  <i>The world will become more difficult, life will become even more difficult, because you will have to take into account the existence of even more piles of people - but this will be correct.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Otherwise, you demonstrate your limitations, not the knowledge of the question.</i>  <i>Limited judgment, the desire to divide people into classes.</i>  <i>No matter what.</i>  <i>"Whiners", nostalgic, or simply dissenters, who need to gnobit at the first opportunity.</i>  <i>If you consider the publication of other denominations as a glance, and not as a heresy, you will no longer smell like smoke and meat in the air.</i> <br>  <i><b>The sixth - sample</b> - for those who find it difficult to clarify the example of my authorship.</i>  <i>Everything is also done and done in ancient times - can be done in 3D.</i>  <i>Similarly beautiful.</i>  <i>Just doing 3D do not like to steam.</i>  <i>The isometric perspective in pre-rendered games allows you to not texture objects from the sides and rear, allows for post-processing.</i>  <i>In the case of a platformer where the view on the content exclusively from the side, this possibility is even wider.</i>  <i>This is a plus, therefore, it is still sometimes easier to use statics, easier to ‚Äúdraw‚Äù, and not to do ‚Äúhonestly‚Äù.</i>  <i>Often, this is honestly not necessary for anyone - this is precisely what caused the retrograde <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/obsidian/project-eternity">Project Eternity Project</a> from Obsidian Entertainment.</i>  <i>They give the players what they wanted.</i>  <i>"Like before".</i>  <i>You can hate this fact as much as you like, but it is.</i>  <i>And this is not my desire, and not my whim.</i>  <i>And the statistical desire of the majority.</i>  <i>If the players did not want this old, then <b>73,986</b> players would not have collected for Obsidian - <b>$ 3,986,929</b> .</i>  <i>To be honest, 3D has recently grown to a level that allowed the industry to step back.</i>  <i>The step back means the use of three-dimensional graphics for static backgrounds as before.</i>  <i>Only with the incredible level of detail that was previously difficult to imagine.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>At one time, the industry could go this way, but chose to go in the direction of three-dimensional graphics, while actually it was possible to go in two ways at the same time.</i>  <i>In part of the game projects it happened.</i>  <i>For example, in Syberia, Benoit Sokal was well aware that the rendered backdrops would be better than models, and that he would be able to process them himself with a brush, giving it a special charm and style.</i>  <i>But in part of the projects, the industry has shown a little 3D for a long time.</i>  <i>The ability to rotate the camera and look at the world from different angles - was amazing.</i>  <i>But the technological capacity for a long time did not keep up with the desired.</i>  <i>Now both tools are equal in strength.</i>  <i>Everything depends on the hand of the Master, and not on the technological limitations of this or that platform, this or that tool.</i> <i><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3f8/093/510/3f8093510e8bf9f62b8699aa70af1131.jpg"><br><br></i>  <i>3D with the ability to rotate the camera requires people to make a model from all sides with the same level of quality around the perimeter.</i>  <i>Therefore, 3D is still inferior to two-dimensional graphics.</i>  <i>Not because it is impossible to do, but because the cost price of cool and stylized 3D increases dramatically.</i>  <i>As in this sample (see above) in order to be cool - you need to work everything and everywhere.</i>  <i>Players want this, but the developer still can not afford to work out all the content in one solution in terms of detail.</i>  <i>Therefore, the industry goes the other way.</i>  <i>By volume, good lighting and materials.</i>  <i>Artwork is always expensive to produce in relation to three-dimensional content, because</i>  <i>more work, even if production is put on stream.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>In the above-mentioned FlashBack, non-processed three-dimensional graphics are used, without styling.</i>  <i>Therefore, I allowed myself to say in relation to him - bad.</i>  <i>Because in the original FB style was - here I see the game at the level of 5 years ago.</i>  <i>Then she would be appropriate.</i>  <i>Now it does not look like a grandfather, but a man of age, without a characteristic charm.</i>  <i>And without an artistic style that would distinguish it from others.</i>  <i>And now many people work with style.</i>  <i>A visual picture burdened with characteristic elements, colors or presentation - makes modern projects as they are.</i>  <i>And they are not recognized by triangles or textures.</i>  <i>And due to the style created by artists led by art director.</i>  <i>So in the FB art director is extremely weak.</i>  <i>This is clearly visible.</i>  <i>It is another matter to judge something more on the basis of a single game play movie - I cannot.</i>  <i>Just like other publications, who cautiously said that this is not quite what I would like to see from FB.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/184240/">https://habr.com/ru/post/184240/</a></p>
