  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Tribute to Konstantin Kalinov</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Any modern vacancy that looks like ‚ÄúUG‚Äù with a banal listing of cookies, makbuk, a spacious office - and you will find only the same workers, without the beginnings of a creative vein or a creative approach to tasks who want to eat cookies and dip them into poppy during working hours.  But today and now this approach is most outdated. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/4a9/41c/def/4a941cdefa19a16f6e0399b0ad8f6f2f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  When an advantage is achieved precisely at the expense of an idea, when success in an innovative and unexpected approach becomes a key argument in the market, then the first thing each company needs to start with is a complete review of its own personnel policy and the application of these same innovations in the search and selection of employees for key positions .  Those who are ‚Äúwith cookies‚Äù - in a couple of years will be brought sands of history with such an attitude to their own team.  Because it is the frames, and their total synergy - today, as never before, everything is decided. <a name="habracut"></a><br>  Strange, but everything in the universe is built on balance.  Nowhere can one get more than to give; no trickery can break Newton's third law.  Unfortunately, many more IT companies point-blank do not understand these rules of the universe and everyone dreams to ‚Äúgrab God by the beard‚Äù with a minimum of effort, which is why there are many groans about personnel shortages, lack of professionals and other personnel problems.  But in reality there are no problems, the law of nature simply works: ‚ÄúTell me who you are - and I will say who you will hire.‚Äù <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/05a/96d/971/05a96d971c5db0b0c24bd21d0cb74b39.jpg" alt="image">

      Sooner or later, one way or another - but everyone in this life receives only what he deserves and deserves.  There are no exceptions to this rule.  Never.  And if you think that with the help of skillful questions and many hours of conversation you can find a practitioner, then karma is already preparing a punishment for you: another job seeker will come to you over and over again, whose words run ahead of real actions for a couple of hundred kilometers. . <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/8fa/2e5/23f/8fa2e523f57b550bb55d58a672788e18.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Today, society is still shocked and surprised by the meeting of any of several adequate people who need a specialist with their hands and head, capable of instantly solving tasks, rather than ‚Äúspeaking a talker‚Äù, desperately attributing to themselves former achievements of their team. departments in past jobs.  Able to become part of the strike of the battle link, smashing competitors, and ready "to put your soul for your friends." <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/748/5a9/97d/7485a997db43f85bddaa09fe83cb712f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  First of all, the search for a quality employee in a team does not necessarily have to look like an ordinary job.  Only losers are looking for work on headhunting sites, and all successful people have long been hired or engaged by themselves.  When the understanding of this most obvious fact comes, then an innovative search strategy is born: on specialized resources. <br><br>  Do you design information systems based on characters?  God will judge you, but then purely out of a sense of the logic of everything that is happening - you need a talented writer, an engineer of human souls who describes life of ordinary people in a good, vital and very natural way, and not at all an illustrator with some usability. <br><br>  Need a cool programmer?  Come to the appropriate resource, "turn on the blonde" and ask for help to deal with a piece of code.  According to the answers you will instantly see not only the professional level of potential applicants, but also the ability to work in a team (I think that a guru who is not ready to help people in a team in an emergency situation is not needed in a real welded team). <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/12e/5e7/ba3/12e5e7ba3d9e7cd7414f1300651b7df2.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Need a brilliant designer?  Ask the VKontakte group to evaluate the finished picture in full.  All pretentious dilettantes and narcissists who are neumey will instantly give themselves up with short unreasonable statements in the spirit of ‚Äúno time to explain,‚Äù ‚Äúall shit,‚Äù and other personal transitions.  You will only have to write in a personal your job offer to the expert who managed, despite his personal work, to try to explain with conviction in at least 2-3 paragraphs - what exactly is bad.  And do not believe the bikes about the great employment, because three paragraphs of the text - this is the time for a cup of coffee or a trip to the toilet, and in fact even the greatest gurus spend their time on this. <br><br>  Need a cool leader?  - Take a closer look at who in a group in any online community is a universally recognized authority and opinion leader, to whom everyone goes for advice and are happy to provide any help and support - this is your team lead. <br><br>  You see how you can use only observation, use the hints of life itself and, instead of going through thousands of similar types of shortcuts, close 3-5 key vacancies per day. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/fbc/473/b7e/fbc473b7eba68ed791b4461710fcf8d8.jpg" alt="image"><br>  But even if your personnel officer is not brave enough and free from stereotypes to get away from the standard placement of vacancies, then here you can still save the situation by the following rule: any vacancy in the creative profession must necessarily contain a test task.  It should not be super-complex, but it should be as bright and as vividly showing the capabilities of applicants.  And most importantly, before the start of the search, you yourself must very accurately and distinctly answer the question: ‚ÄúAnd what kind of answer will you be looking for‚Äù;  because the equation without an answer has no solution in principle, and every schoolchild is aware of this. <br><br>  The creative task can be any - for the smm-manager to make a video about himself and collect a thousand views;  for a marketer or art director to come up with a non-existent product, a promotion strategy and a promotional site structure.  The general law of life is this.  that a liar and a crook will be able to justify their skills only in a very narrow profile of activity.  the real expert, however, easily and naturally owns the skills and deepest knowledge in a dozen or even a hundred related fields, since he is really immersed and extremely passionate about his work and has long grown beyond the job description. <br><br>  So you will gradually discover the truth that a person who is not able, for example, to assemble a flash mob of 20 people to shout out your company name, can never become a leader in a major direction, despite a lot of fake achievements in a portfolio, And of course, the lack of skills e-mail or the target audience of the future project - devalues ‚Äã‚Äãany real value in the market from any pompous expert. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/9dd/dec/1e3/9dddec1e39581df97e9e7833e1382071.jpg" alt="image"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/292220/">https://habr.com/ru/post/292220/</a></p>
