Sony Xperia X smartphone review</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> As you remember, Sony has a completely new line of smartphones this year.  These are Xperia X, Xperia X Performance, Xperia XA and the Xperia XA Ultra phablet.  The centerpiece of the new series is the Xperia X - a smartphone that has well-balanced features and is sold at a very attractive price.  About him today and we'll talk. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3ae/b73/5c7/3aeb735c7db64d90aaf42bdcd14b1b8b.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Appearance</b> <br>  All devices line Xperia is not much different from each other in appearance - the unity of style, everything.  But one clear difference still exists.  The XA screen has no side frames, while the Xperia X has them.  Perhaps this device looks more modest, but modesty is not a vice. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2ae/c28/c22/2aec28c228804ee7bfa8aadfdcbf9be7.jpg">

      Sony smartphones can always boast of noble materials in the design.  Minimum plastic, maximum glass and metal.  So with the Xperia X, the back panel of the case is made of solid aluminum sheet.  Plastic, even very high quality, would not look so great.  Sony Xperia X is available in four colors: graphite black, white, and rose gold and gold lime with a pleasant greenish tint.  The design is extremely restrained, there are no frills on the lid: only the camera's eye and the window under the flash, and in the center - XPERIA engraving. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/234/96d/799/23496d799000478e82c9bd9b5bf67903.jpg"><br><br>  Hardware buttons are located on the right side of the case.  The power button is rounded rectangular, it has now completely replaced the old round large key.  At the very bottom is the camera shortcut button, and between it and the power button - the volume rocker.  It is a bit unusual to see it here: traditionally, the volume control is placed closer to the top, but this does not cause inconvenience. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f16/ce1/bf1/f16ce1bf142a49ef96555de33904c707.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4e3/9b2/0f0/4e39b20f01c7467f880322baedc3167c.jpg"><br><br>  The microUSB port is located on the bottom of the case, and the 3.5 mm headset jack is located on the top.  On the left side there is a single slot for a SIM card and a microSD memory card with a maximum capacity of 200 gigabytes.  Thus, in total, the owners of Xperia X may have 232 or 264 GB for content storage. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c8d/43a/f92/c8d43af9202a4d35a846bee430ce403e.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e1c/744/c17/e1c744c17c64419c9c352c10b2f7f50e.jpg"><br><br>  The only reason for changing the shape of the power button was the built-in fingerprint scanner.  If you hold the smartphone with your right hand, then the thumb rests directly on this button and unlock the device conveniently.  Reading takes place almost instantly, and the sensor responds normally even to a dirty finger, although in extreme cases it may take several attempts. <br><br>  <b>Screen</b> <br>  In our opinion, the diagonal from 4.5 to 5 inches can be called optimal for most smartphones.  So there is a wonderful balance between the convenience of holding, carrying in your pocket and good possibilities for surfing the Internet and using multimedia.  In Xperia X, the screen is just right: exactly five inches, Full HD resolution, 441 ppi density.  Tempered glass, which is the top layer of the screen, is rounded at the edges - it looks very cool.  What is the advantage of such a 2.5D-screen over the traditional flat?  First, the curved screen visually seems larger.  Secondly, the case with such a screen completely loses right angles and noticeable joints, and the smartphone itself becomes stronger and more solid. <br><br>  The display brightness is enough in any light, a separate sensor is responsible for the automatic adjustment.  There is a control mode in gloves - in the winter this function will be difficult to overestimate.  In general, the screen does not cause any complaints: it is contrast, bright and at least not worse than the displays of competing models. <br><br>  <b>Filling</b> <br>  The heart of the system is a Qualcomm Snapdragon 650 six-core processor, and there are already three gigabytes of RAM.  Perhaps, at the moment it is the most reasonable maximum, more memory is not even necessary.  Sony Xperia X easily copes with heavy applications hanging in the memory and dozens of open tabs in the browser without a hint of slowdowns.  The amount of internal memory depends on the version of the smartphone - with one or two slots for SIM-cards.  In the first case, you will have 32 GB of internal storage, in the second - 64 GB.  The version for two SIM cards is a hybrid slot, that is, you can put either two operator cards, or one SIM card and one memory card. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ab7/baa/afd/ab7baaafd9ad4dcc99a88ba76c3a36a7.jpg"><br><br>  Testing performance in synthetic benchmarks gave an expectedly good result.  And the way Xperia X is not a technological flagship (in the new line this role is played by Xperia X Performance), it does an excellent job both with games and with all other everyday tasks. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c1c/dc3/fbf/c1cdc3fbfade416a90f926f6613fe1eb.jpg"><br><br>  A 2620 mAh battery allows the Xperia X to operate for up to two days autonomously.  But, of course, the running time is highly dependent on usage scenarios.  Under standard modes (calls, music, internet surfing, navigation, social networks, few games), the device quietly withstands a full day from early morning to late evening.  But the test of autonomy in the mobile version of PCMark (mixed work with a screen brightness of 60%) resulted in 8 hours.  By the way, this test stops when the smartphone still has 20% of the charge.  And this is enough for about an hour of testing or a couple of hours in normal operation. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/137/6af/b0d/1376afb0d9a6438a8f3defc976102cdf.png"><br><br>  Like other Sony smartphones, this model supports fast charging technology.  Ten minutes of battery recharge will provide up to 5.5 hours of smartphone operation.  Of course, this time also depends directly on what you will do with Xperia X: just make calls, watch Full HD-video or, say, listen to music.  But the usual fast charge, as you know, badly affects the durability of the battery.  Strictly speaking, the faster it charges, the shorter its service life will be.  But Sony has an excellent solution that will significantly extend the life of the battery. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/002/cb2/3f7/002cb23f7d944f7d95c1ee08e19487f6.png"><br><br>  The technology is called Qnovo, and its main essence is that special algorithms continuously monitor the battery capacity and regulate the incoming current.  Moreover, the current is always calculated in such a way as to be maximum and at the same time harmless to the battery in each segment of the charging cycle.  As a result, with Qnovo, we get twice the battery life compared to QuickCharge 2.0 or 3.0.  By the way, it will be very interesting to test batteries after 2-3 years of use in QuickCharge mode. <br><br>  <b>Camera</b> <br>  Sony has equipped Xperia X cameras with 23 MP and 13 MP.  The main camera has an autofocus mechanism that works just lightning fast.  First, it uses a hybrid, contrast-phase, focusing method.  Exactly the same technology is used in Sony's best mirrorless cameras, where it has already managed to establish itself in the best possible way. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d85/707/522/d857075221dd4746a6ae33878f47d49e.jpg"><br><br>  Another feature of the Sony Xperia X - predictive autofocus.  Software algorithms of the camera analyze the trajectory of movement of objects in the frame and successfully predict at what point a particular object will be in the next instant.  From a technical viewpoint, this is a real reporter tool.  Well, in everyday life, all these features will be useful for shooting children or pets. <br><br>  In addition, the sensor supports shooting with high sensitivity (up to ISO 12800), which is not superfluous when shooting in the dark.  Here are some shooting examples with maximum quality settings. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/89b/51a/adb/89b51aadbb21400d9760fae3fbb2e159.JPG"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/628/0d1/a93/6280d1a93d4d4a1280bf6a08e650b22a.JPG"><br><br>  The front camera, with a smaller number of megapixels, boasts wide-angle optics (22 millimeters equivalent) and a large aperture (f / 2.0).  There is no flash in front, but it is unlikely that anyone will worry about it. <br><br>  <b>findings</b> <br>  In general, Xperia X was a tough nut to crack, it is very difficult to find fault with it.  It is fast, productive and stylish, with good features for taking photos and videos.  For those who dealt with earlier Sony models, there will be some unusual moments in Xperia X.  For example, there is no glass panel behind.  Unusually, but in life such a decision turned out to be much more practical.  Instead of the good old round power button, there is now a flat, slightly in-depth key.  At first it also seems unusual, but there is a fingerprint scanner with which you can unlock a smartphone much faster and more conveniently.  In general, the question of the expediency of switching to Xperia X is not even worth it - you definitely need to switch. <br><br>  <b>Key Sony Xperia X specifications</b> <br>  <b>Display</b> size: 5 inches; <br>  <b>Display resolution</b> : Full HD (1920x1080 pixels, density ~ 441 ppi);  technology support Triluminos Display, X-Reality, Dynamic Contrast Enhancer; <br>  <b>Chipset</b> : Qualcomm MSM8956 Snapdragon 650 (6 cores); <br>  <b>Memory</b> : 3 GB operational, 32/64 GB non-volatile, slot for microSD memory cards up to 200 GB; <br>  <b>Main camera</b> : 23 megapixel, LED flash, video recording in Full HD resolution; <br>  <b>Front camera</b> : 13 megapixel with wide-angle and high-aperture optics (22 mm, F2.0); <br>  <b>Battery</b> : Li-ion, 2620 mAh, non-removable; <br>  <b>SIM card format</b> : nano-SIM; <br>  <b>Optional</b> : fingerprint sensor, NFC <br>  <b>Operating system</b> : Android 6.0 Marshmallow <br>  <b>Dimensions and weight</b> : 142.7 x 69.4 x 7.9 mm;  153 grams; <br>  <b>Price in Russia</b> : 39,990 rubles / 40,990 (Dual SIM) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/395673/">https://habr.com/ru/post/395673/</a></p>
