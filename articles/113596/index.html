The length of the highway is 1842 kilometers.  Ask why you had to pull nearly two thousand kilometers of cable, although you could reach the USA by hand?  It's all about the complicated relationship between Cuba and the United States.  Because of the economic sanctions imposed by the United States in Cuba, there is no way to ‚Äúthrow‚Äù the cable just 120 kilometers to the US coast.  Because of all these problems, there has not yet been a normal Internet channel in Cuba - there are satellite communication channels, but they, of course, are not the solution.  The Internet in Cuba is a rather expensive thing, and almost inaccessible to the majority of the inhabitants of the ‚ÄúIsland of Freedom‚Äù. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  Commercial use of the highway will begin in early summer.  Talk about laying the highway began a long time ago, back in 2006, however, they began to do something only at the end of last year.  To participate in the project attracted the French company Alcatel-Lucent, which took up the laying of the submarine cable.  It is also worth noting that, because of the embargo, the project participants had to observe one interesting condition - the highway itself should not contain more than 10% of elements made in the USA.  True, most of everything and everything is now produced in China anyway, so this problem can be considered insignificant.

      Perhaps after some time, ordinary Cubans will be able to use the Internet.  True, according to the Cuban administration, this will not happen soon, as it is necessary to solve a lot of technical and economic problems before the Internet goes to the masses.  Until 2008, Cubans could not even have mobile phones or computers.  In 2008, the relevant permission was signed by Fidel Castro's brother - Raul Castro.  Fidel Castro was very sick at the time, and they were already beginning to talk about how Fidel could no longer control Cuba.  He was temporarily replaced as leader by Raul Castro, who somewhat softened the strict laws of Cuba.  After recovery Fidel Castro (as far as we know, while incomplete), he did not begin to cancel innovations. <br><br>  The total bandwidth of the channel, by the way, is 640 Gb / s - this is quite enough for Cuba, which now has a ‚Äúnarrower‚Äù communication channel 300 times.  In general, it remains only to be happy for the Cubans - let's hope that soon they will become an integral part of the Internet community. <br><br>  Via <a href="http://topnews.net.nz/content/211788-venezuela-cuba-submarine-fiber-optic-cable-reaches-cuba">topnews.net</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/113596/">https://habr.com/ru/post/113596/</a></p>
