      PS Nobody wants to fix a feature with a retargeting pixel and Habrom, so you can use it. <br>  PPS - programmers contacted, fixed, you can sleep in peace. <br>  PPPS Under the cat a lot of pictures <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  This article was written by my friend Vlad Stepanenko, since the volume of his advertising funds passed through the Facebook advertising office to infinity times (several million against my 0 rubles) are more than mine. <br><br>  This time we will talk about Facebook advertising office - a social network that is known for its adult and solvent audience (although, in fairness, it is worth noting that with the right search, it can be found in all social networks).  In the screenshot below, you can get acquainted with a brief FB statistics for the Russian Federation. <br>  http: // <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/15e/8f5/d91/15e8f5d914e34afb8758f9cf3b2b23bf.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Setting up advertising campaigns on Facebook seems extremely complicated and convoluted for many users.  However, in reality - everything is not so bad here, and sometimes it is much easier than in similar projects. <br><br>  The disadvantages of this social network include the relative complexity of the interface and difficult communication with those support.  If you can get used to the interface in 3-4 hours, then with support, questions may arise throughout the work.  Nevertheless, we know how to solve this problem, but more on that later. <br><br>  At the same time, Facebook has more than enough advantages: <br><ul><li>  in contrast to the same Contact, Facebook offers users an autotransport, which in 99% of cases justifies itself.  This means that the user does not need to constantly monitor the campaign and make adjustments. </li><li>  multifunctional cabinet that supports mass operations.  Copying your ads to new audiences will take no more than a minute and three clicks. </li><li>  in VK it is quite difficult to achieve good audiences without constantly parsing audiences using their own or third-party services.  An analysis of user interests based on behavioral factors is much better implemented on Facebook, making it very easy to find several categories of interests to find your audience. </li></ul><br><br>  In order to get into it, you must go to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/">www.facebook.com/business</a> and click on "Create an advertisement."  You will see a similar screen with the following options: <br>  http: // <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d68/1c9/0a7/d681c90a71ea48ffbd07ee4047f332dc.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>1. Redirect people to the website</b> <br>  Redirect users by clicking on a banner to your website. <br>  http: // <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/757/23e/231/75723e231b85486383a33ea4bda656f5.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>2. Increase the number of conversions on the website.</b> <br>  To set up conversions, you need to put a pixel on the site (but about this, according to tradition, we will tell later). <br>  <b>3. Increase engagement for your application.</b> <br>  Everything that is connected with applications, as practice shows, is used very rarely, so we will not focus on this point. <br>  <b>4. Raise publication</b> <br>  I recommend to promote the publication from the advertising office, and not directly through the button in the post.  Because, if you move straight forward, you lose possibly the choice of detailed targeting. <br>  <b>5. See item 3.</b> <br>  <b>6. Promote the page.</b> <br>  If you need marks I like per page, then this format is for you. <br>  <b>7. Reach people near your company.</b> <br>  Advertise to people living within walking distance or a few kilometers away from your company. <br>  <b>8. Increase attendance at your event.</b> <br>  If you are promoting an event, then this format is for you, although for the frequent cost of promoting an event, it is more expensive than promoting a page. <br>  <b>9. Stimulate interest in your offer.</b> <br>  http: // <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d5f/84a/2c4/d5f84a2c48da417799f9e0d447a1eb70.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Advertising with the purpose of "using the offer" allows you to tell customers about discounts. <br>  <b>10. Video views.</b> <br>  It's no secret that video content is gaining momentum, and involves more than text, so the topic of promoting video on FB is very relevant, besides promoting video is very inexpensive now, on average, views cost 0.005-0.01 cents. <br>  <b>11. Get leads for your company.</b> <br>  If you do not have a landing / site, then this is your salvation.  FB will help you create a form for capturing the user's contacts, and at the same time fill it out.  Here is the empty form: <br>  http: // <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d5f/4c7/118/d5f4c7118d344e29bf7bc4282e4c8f93.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Let's take a look at the setting using the example of the option ‚ÄúRedirect people to a website‚Äù - click and paste the required user to activate the ‚ÄúCreate an advertising account‚Äù button. <br><br>  We fill in the country, currency and time zone settings (if you wish, you can specify the name of the account in the advanced settings) - and click continue.  Take seriously the choice of currency, since it is impossible to change it.  The only option is to create a new advertising cabinet. <br><br>  After choosing the goal of the campaign, we get into the setting of the audience: <br>  http: // <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fa3/de7/233/fa3de72335ea4b52884b72018aefa0ec.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  We have 3 options for setting up a place: everything in this area (if we have a wide geo and do not have an exact binding, for example, to conduct webinars), who live in this place (if you need users who live in a particular city, suitable for restaurant promotion), recently visited this place (if you need ???), traveling in this place (if you need tourists, approach for the promotion of taxi services, museums, exhibitions). <br><br>  <b>The main rule when choosing a geo</b> : one country - one campaign (preferably 1 city - 1 campaign)! <br><br>  With age, everything is standard: choose the age that corresponds to the age of our Central Asia, then when the FB gives its statistics, we will see how best to segment it.  Always share men and women. <br><br>  Language is the actual setting if you need users from a country that speak a different language.  Example: Russian-speaking users from Germany. <br><br>  Detailed targeting in the FB is implemented very cool: on the basis of behavioral factors and various surveys, the social network rather accurately defines professions, interests, and demographic data.  Therefore, in FB, for example, you can easily select a segment: parents with children up to a year. <br><br>  On Facebook, you can also customize ads for users associated with your public page, application, event, show ads to your subscribers or friends of your subscribers, or exclude these segments altogether from advertising. <br>  http: // <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b1b/6d2/084/b1b6d20849b641e9a4f9bc7fc73975bf.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  When choosing a placement, I advise you to separate ads for each of them, one audience is a mob.  tape, the second - the PC tape, the third - instagram.  The right column in 80% of cases gives expensive clicks, so I use it only when retargeting. <br>  http: // <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e99/753/0b4/e997530b470c48eabf5f4fee492c2b4f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Auto bet steers on Facebook, there's nothing more to add.  I also advise you to specify a daily budget.  Then give FB a few days to build up, to start getting adequate results. <br>  http: // <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d2c/86c/be1/d2c86cbe128e46299099eff12bc7eba8.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In the menu above, you must select the format of advertising.  Try to create at least 2 ads of each format in order to understand what gives the best result for your niche. In 90% of cases I use one image.  Next you need to select an advertising banner.  It can be added from the tent, which is open to FB, or you can download your own version.  By the way, for advertising, you can use faces of celebrities, FB, unlike other social networks, as a rule, has nothing against it. <br><br>  Well, then - you need to choose profiles, on behalf of which will go advertising, write headlines and ad text (by the way, questions work particularly well in the headlines).  Add a link with utm-tag for conversion tracking, and you just have to run your first ad to join the amazing world of online advertising! <br><br>  PS Why is this sad descriptive standard features, you ask?  Because many users do not even have a general idea of ‚Äã‚Äãhow to even get into the advertising cabinet, not to mention the inside view.  Before sharing hardcore, we decided to first lightly fill you with an educational program.  Further more. <br><br>  PPS As promised in the last sentence of the last posting about the <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/301730/">retargeting pixel and Habr√©</a> (the link there, at the very bottom, the blue link is highlighted), I will no longer leave here a link to my channel in Telegram.  For nefik. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/302324/">https://habr.com/ru/post/302324/</a></p>
