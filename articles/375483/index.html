  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Most popular torrent sites: ranking at the beginning of 2015</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In early 2015, KickassTorrents broke out on top of traffic, followed by Torrentz.  The icon of the sharing file of The Pirate Bay is still not working, but its total clones, copies and followers participate in the rating together. <br><br>  The remaining items on the list are occupied by already known sites.  Since last year, there has been only one change - Limetorrents.cc took the place of the retired Bitsnoop.com.  One of the oldest sites, Demonoid, who returned to the online after a long absence, though not in the rating, but steadily climbing up.  We can still see it on the chart. <br><br>  So, the chart itself (based on data from Alexa and US Compete, and some other indicators): <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  1. <a href="http://kickass.so/">KickassTorrents</a> (last year number 2) </h4><br>  Founded in 2009, and this year took the place of The Pirate Bay even before the latter closed.  Fighting with the right holders, the site has already changed several domains, and currently exists at the (symbolic) Somali address Kickass.so

    <h4>  2. <a href="http://www.torrentz.eu/">Torrentz</a> (last year number 3) </h4><br>  For many years, leading the list of meta-search engines.  Unlike other rating sites, it does not store torrents, but simply redirects users to external links. <br><br><h4>  3. <a href="http://extratorrent.cc/">ExtraTorrent</a> (last year number 4) </h4><br>  Continues to gain traffic and move up in the ranking.  MPAA recently called him one of the largest torrent sites.  I was forced to change the domain from .com to .cc.  The site uses the popular release groups ETTV and ETRG <br><br><h4>  4. <a href="http://thepiratebay.se/">The Pirate Bay</a> (copies and clones; last year # 1) </h4><br>  At the time of the ranking, the site does not work - however, there are several copies and clones of the site that (temporarily) took its place.  The most popular of them is OldPiratebay.org, which, judging by the traffic, claims at least the 4th place in this list. <br><br><h4>  5. <a href="http://yts.re/">YTS</a> (last year number 4) </h4><br>  Site release group YIFY.  Three years ago nobody knew about them, but today their releases are one of the most recognizable (and qualitative).  This reputation led to the blocking of the site in the UK, but despite this, it continues to gain momentum. <br><br><h4>  6. <a href="http://eztv.it/">EZTV</a> (last year number 6) </h4><br>  Niche site, with a specialization in TV content.  The traffic varies along with the activity of the television series.  Only a few dozen torrents per week attract millions of users. <br><br><h4>  7. <a href="http://rarbg.com/">RARBG</a> (last year number 10) </h4><br>  It began with a Bulgarian tracker a few years ago, and in 2014 for the first time hit the chart.  The growing popularity has led to the blocking of the site in the UK. <br><br><h4>  8. <a href="http://isohunt.to/">isoHunt.to</a> (last year # 8) </h4><br>  It was launched in October 2013, two weeks after the closure of isoHunt.com.  It is not associated with the old isoHunt, although the design is completely copied from a closed resource.  In the meantime, something was achieved with such a move, in particular, they collected a million page views per day.  Interestingly, the authors of this particular site are behind the reincarnation of Pirate Bay Oldpiratebay.org. <br><br><h4>  9. <a href="http://1337x.to/">1337x</a> (last year number 7) </h4><br>  Works more on the social aspect than other sites.  The owners say that they launched it, ‚Äúin order to fill the obvious void in the absence of high-quality torrent sites without ads with public trackers.‚Äù  Bid farewell to the .org domain and is now working at 1337x.to <br><br><h4>  10. <a href="http://www.limetorrents.cc/">Limetorrents</a> </h4><br>  The site has existed for several years, and for the first time got into our list.  In the news, he appeared in the summer after LionsGate sued him for placing a link to the leaked film ‚ÄúThe Expendables 3‚Äù (a copy in good quality leaked a few weeks before the release - this is, according to Stallone, a bad box office film collections).  The case is still pending. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/375483/">https://habr.com/ru/post/375483/</a></p>
