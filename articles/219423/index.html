      <b>What is the attractiveness of system analysis?</b>  <b>And what is its complexity?</b> <br><br>  <b>Irina Surova:</b> ‚ÄúThe attractiveness of the system analysis lies in the ability to make a beautiful decision with minimal effort, as well as at the early stages of the project to foresee all possible disadvantages and risks in it. <br><br>  However, there is a system analysis and complexity.  For me, they are that the analyst does not produce the final result, our result is intermediate and, unfortunately, it is rarely possible to touch and check it. ‚Äù <br><br>  <b>Denis Beskov:</b> ‚ÄúProperly using your head and communication skills, you will be able to move multi-million projects, direct them in the right direction, save many working hours of IT project participants and decent amounts to investors, and ideally help you to make the lives of millions of people better.‚Äù . <br><br>  The complexity of the profession is that the decisions that are made in the course of such work are of great importance for projects, respectively, the cost of error and responsibility are very high.  And in order to make such responsible decisions, you need to be able to identify and take into account many circumstances - nuances of legislation, technological trends, experience and motivation of users, political conflicts, actions of competitors. <br><br>  If you try to close all risks and test all hypotheses, then this approach will make the whole project unprofitable, so you have to re-select the scope, depth and methods of research and design each time, relying on the experience of past successes and failures. <br><br>  Another nuance is that, unlike many other professions, it is difficult to get quick feedback on your ideas and find mistakes in the analysis, so the learning cycle lasts a long time - having no experience in 3-4 projects made or failed, it is very difficult to understand which solutions will work and which ones will not. ‚Äù <br><br>  <b>What are the key qualities that a good systems analyst should have?</b> <br><br>  <b>Irina Surova:</b> ‚ÄúIn my opinion, a good systems analyst should be different: <br><br>  - system thinking and a propensity to analyze; <br>  - communication skills, which include both the understanding of other people and the clear transfer of information to the interlocutor; <br>  - active position; <br>  - curiosity and readiness to quickly learn new subject areas, technologies and developments ". <br><br>  <b>Denis Beskov:</b> ‚ÄúA good systems analyst should be able to think systematically - that is,  be able to form and justify a picture of relationships, facts, events and phenomena. <br><br>  There are usually two such paintings.  The first is a picture of the present, in which we conduct research, clarifying the interconnections of people, organizations and technologies, as well as the problematic situation that brought the project to life.  The second is a picture of the future, how the target system created should be arranged, how exactly the work and life of people and companies will change in it, how the system will bring the necessary benefits. <br><br>  Another, no less important skill, I would put communication - the ability to communicate with different people, extract and convey information in different ways, to explain complex things in simple and understandable language.  Without this, the analyst, even talented as a thinker, will be an uncut diamond, useless for combat projects. ‚Äù <br><br>  <b>What tips can you, as an experienced systems analyst, give young professionals who are just beginning to take their first steps in the field?</b> <br><br>  <b>Irina Surova:</b> ‚ÄúThe best advice is to constantly practice, in other words, just work.  It is also important to analyze your results and compare what is taught in the courses and in the books with your real actions.  And for this, of course, you need to read books and learn. ‚Äù <br><br>  <b>Denis Beskov:</b> ‚ÄúDo not hesitate to participate to the fullest in testing and implementing systems created according to your requirements and models - this is the only way you can reliably know the quality of the ideas you have laid, see and correct your mistakes!‚Äù <br><br>  <b>Should analysts (both beginners in the field and already experienced specialists) attend industry trainings, specialized conferences, etc.?</b>  <b>Why?</b> <br><br>  <b>Irina Surova:</b> ‚ÄúFor me, trainings and conferences are an opportunity to temporarily rise above weekdays and look at the trends of the IT industry.  This is a means of expanding the outlook, an opportunity to learn the specifics of work in other subject areas, in a different development culture, and simply in other companies.  It is also an opportunity to communicate with people on the same wavelength, compare our results, catch new thoughts and inspiration for further interesting work. ‚Äù <br><br>  <b>Denis Beskov:</b> ‚ÄúIf we talk about the tasks of professional development, nothing will ever replace a good mentor and leader.  Unfortunately, the institute of mentoring in our IT space is very poorly developed, and only a few are lucky enough to work in such wonderful conditions.  Therefore, a necessary measure becomes the appeal of experts to consultations, articles, literature, trainings and conferences. <br><br>  Conferences and trainings are also interesting because here you can meet with colleagues in the industry, share experiences, learn about new methods and the possibilities of using them. ‚Äù <br><br>  <b>What interesting things have you prepared for the participants of the Analyst Days-3 conference?</b> <br><br>  <b>Irina Surova:</b> ‚ÄúAt the conference there will be a continuation of my <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/VLDCORP/ss-21934265">last year‚Äôs story</a> about how we work with business and system requirements in Kaspersky Lab R &amp; D.  We wanted to make comfortable work on large products, on which many teams work at once, and now we will share the results.  The focus of the presentation will be shifted from the needs of a specific project team to the needs of the owners of the systems, the projects' programs and the R &amp; D work on the products as a whole. " <br><br>  <b>Denis Beskov:</b> ‚ÄúI will share my experience in setting requirements for the quality of software in the form of typical quality profiles. <br><br>  Errors in the definition of non-functional requirements lead to a multiple increase in the cost of projects, to the inability of the system to bring the intended benefits.  Many contractors try to avoid this topic, thus shifting the risks to customers in the "you did not ask - we did not." <br><br>  In turn, customers, speaking of the system, are ready to paint for a long time and a lot, what functional characteristics they see, and they speak about quality briefly, absolutely and amorphically - ‚Äúthe system must be safe, the system must be reliable, the system interface must be intuitive‚Äù .  Such words usually do not lead to anything concrete in designing. <br><br>  The same analysts who work on the side of customers, run into the problem of determining the exact quantitative values ‚Äã‚Äãof the indicators - how to calculate the required response time of the system?  How to set the level of reliability? <br><br>  Another problem is that, for example, international standards for software quality result in dozens of possible indicators, and it is difficult for a specialist without a decade of experience to choose the right ones for a particular project. <br><br>  These two problems and eliminate the proposed classifier of the types of systems and standard quality profiles, which I will present and describe at the conference. ‚Äù <br><br>  Isn't it true, experts prepared a very interesting topic for the conference on May 24?  Want to know more?  Then <a href="http://analystdays.com/ru/registration">register</a> ! <br><br>  So, is it worth being at the very epicenter of events in the sphere of system and business intelligence on May 24?  Of course, worth it!  Only at ‚ÄúAnalyst Days-2014‚Äù you will learn the latest trends in business and systems analysis, personally meet and talk with the best experts in the field, be able to learn from the experience of the leaders of the IT industry and be inspired by new achievements in your work. <br><br>  Detailed information about the conference you can get from the organizers: <br><br>  LLC "Testing Laboratory" <br>  Russian Federation, Moscow <br>  Tel.  in Russia: +7 (916) 47-47-525 <br>  Tel.  in Belarus: +375 29 770-48-58 <br>  Skype: vldcorp <br>  ICQ: 71226628 <br>  E-mail: org@it-conf.ru </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/219423/">https://habr.com/ru/post/219423/</a></p>
