  <section class="page js-page"><h1>A bunch of MODx Revolution + LiveStreet</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> When I was going to write my topic, I wondered where to write it?  On the one hand, part of the site is written in MODx, on the other hand, the other part is written in LiveStreet, and on the third side, these are such crutches that it is time to write in Abnormal programming.  It turned out that Habr was preparing for such a turn of events and made it possible to write several blogs at once, for which he had a separate respect!  :-) <br><br>  Well, now to the main question itself: At one time I wrote and launched a <a href="http://pro-cent.ru/">coupon service</a> , written by itself on MODx Revolution (by itself, because I am an ardent fan of this engine and no matter what I write, I always write on this framework). <br>  So, the project grew, developed, a lot of functionality was written (MODx benefit allows you to solve any task), but I just thought about the social networking blog a la Habrahabr to launch, so that all our users were there, yes on shares got there, so that the reviews were in the actions, and in the social sphere, and so that there and there they could be commented and read them in a separate thread all up to the heap, and many, many things ... And when I thought how much time will it take me to program it all myself, I have become very sad  m ... <br><br>  But I remembered LiveStreet, about which I had heard a long time ago, and the fact that it is positioned as an easy and fast clone of Habr.  So I decided to raise the social link separately on LS and link it to my main site on MODx.  <a href="http://forum.pro-cent.ru/">LiveStreet installed</a> and launched in a couple of hours (this is my first acquaintance with this engine). <a name="habracut"></a>

      Running a little ahead, I give advice: if you decide to repeat the same, then when you deploy LS, then give the tables a unique prefix, starting from the prefix of the MODx tables.  For example, if you have a modx_ prefix for MODx, then for LS, give something like modx_ls_, so that you can later add your module under MODx and create a prefix scheme for it so that you can work with crutches LS.  By the way, this <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/123072/">topic</a> can be useful for you. <br><br>  Then he edited the user registration template, prohibiting direct registration on the site, indicating that users must register on the main site, and not here.  For understanding, let‚Äôs denote that MODx is the main <a href="http://pro-cent.ru/">pro-cent.ru</a> site, and LS is <a href="http://forum.pro-cent.ru/">forum.pro-cent.ru.</a> In general, further on MODx, add a key to the modx_users table on the ls_users nameplate so that you can easily access MODx to user LS via user record MODx. <br><br>  Honestly, I still don‚Äôt really know LiveStreet, and so far I haven‚Äôt seriously considered the option of a single user table for both MODx and LS right away, but in principle I have a secondary key configured for a table with a lock on deletion, which ensures data integrity at the level database, and in general problems even with separate user tables does not arise. <br><br>  In general, then you just need to register your API for MODx interaction with LS.  Someone may write it through require 'LS / public_html / index.php', I have everything through POST via CURL with passing the necessary parameters and the key to protect requests so that some robot will not produce anything for you :-) <br><br>  I will not be given in details now how everything is done there, since the topic is no longer written as a specific manual, but for general development, but if someone likes the idea and someone wants to crank it up, well, , questions in the studio, I will answer. <br><br>  PS I forgot to say that on MODx also the activity from social networks is derived.  If you go to the main <a href="http://pro-cent.ru/">site</a> , you will see it in the right column. <br><br>  PPS Here the complaint arrived that we still need technical aspects to describe in more detail.  Good.  I will describe the general API scheme that I applied to the interaction of the main site with LS. <br><br>  I‚Äôll say right away that LS is a rather original engine, and very actively uses noSQL as a basis for caching, therefore I‚Äôd not recommend directly working with the social network database, but working through its Actions (I‚Äôm not going to write a LiveStreet workshop, you will have to master yourself). <br><br>  As a blank for everything else, I will describe the procedure for creating a topic and a comment to it by means of a request from the main site. <br>  First we add our Action to LS, through which we will trigger the request.  To do this, we create our own module-config, for example, config / modules / modx (we will need it later for all requests) and create the file config.route.php in it.  We will need it in order to register our URLs for the engine. In it we write the following: <br> <code>$config['page']['modxtopic'] = 'ActionModxTopic'; <br> $config['page']['modxblog'] = 'ActionModxBlog'; <br> return $config;</code> <br> <br>  This config will be needed by the engine to determine from the URLs what action to perform.  In this case, there will be <b>URLs / modxtopic</b> and <b>/ modxblog</b> .  When these <b>URLs are accessed,</b> actions will be triggered with the classes <b>/classes/actions/ActionModxTopic.class.php</b> and <b>/classes/actions/actions/oditionModxBlog.class.php,</b> respectively. <br>  Of course, you have to create for yourself the necessary classes in the image and likeness, plus to this necessarily also template files on the basis of the / templates folder (usually / templates / skin / site skin) / actions / your Action (in this case ActionModxTopic or ActionModxBlog ) /index.tpl or action.tpl <br>  In general, you will have to study all this in practice, because you cannot describe it in three lines. <br><br>  I thought out these classes for myself in order to overload the base classes of the LS itself, because LS itself does not provide an API for such actions, and the basic functionality is designed so that the user is authorized and it is impossible to overload the user from the outside.  You do not want to write a lot of extra code and understand the caching system, etc. <br>  In general, we want to add a topic.  Work with the topic is done via /classes/actions/ActionTopic.class.php, with comments via /classes/actions/ActionBlog.class.php Creating your own class, you overload the base class, and write the Init () function and the function of the called action in it, for example, Blog's SubmitComment () class saves a comment. <br><br>  Unfortunately, there‚Äôs some kind of garbage going on with hyphenation, so I can‚Äôt normally insert 200 lines of code in my class, in which everything is written, so I‚Äôll have to go further myself.  True file with the class code posted <a href="">here</a> .  There may be something superfluous, but it will be possible to sort out in general.  There are comments. <br><br>  In fact, in general, everything is done. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/151540/">https://habr.com/ru/post/151540/</a></p>
