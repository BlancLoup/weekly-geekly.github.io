Their opinions are collected in the report, although the confusion with the concept of ‚Äúcomponent‚Äù continues (naturally, for Figma, this is just a thing in the design template, not a piece of code). <br><br><h4>  <a href="https://vk.com/%40pdigest-illustration-02">Unified illustrations in digital products</a> </h4><br>  The unified style of illustrations for Slack, which appeared in 2017, is an unconditional hit that half of the companies actively reproduce.  It allows in a playful form to combine humanity (people are displayed entirely and in the plots) and to show the key metaphors of the product (objects and parts of the interface).  Well, just a typical trend, for which everyone ran, grappled with a train - there are other stylistics that solve these problems. <br><br><h4>  <a href="https://www.byalicelee.com/slack">Slack</a> </h4><br>  Alice Lee, who started a wave for Slack, spoke about the work on the project.  The starting mindboard, intermediate variations, library of typical objects and a large gallery of results - individually and in detail. <br><br><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/yl9kKSWLoIhGRaGCgu_SwF8jqPAzvbndH7JArZR6VFtuTlZBqcudaIkEHqVCZYDaKdv5XdVkj1Wlao2ZmdwXKojdDrpGku9fX4aH9tgsCOj7ocoOhErTDBAoCAlDpjpQYloK8IHz"><br><br>  At the end of the article, Alice gives good advice for those who seek their own style.  Now several generators of stock illustrations have appeared, which greatly reduce the cost of their creation and make them accessible to more companies (and cloning, of course, kills the diversity and value of one‚Äôs own face): <br><br><h4>  <a href="https://www.humaaans.com/">Humaaans</a> and <a href="https://www.drawkit.io/">Drawkit</a> </h4><br>  Cheaply repeat Slack style. <br><br><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/R9ydahLTuRbD5wGYpXwDzcJKkAieOlwcE3g6ayuycHHC1C28N6g-3ESp-yg1b2b_CyZ4EkHcvbxlCMY-aYtHPU_6Ox80S85odJUDgGaS6UG0udfNij3itDP-TnLFxpty7Mq_xRa7"><br><br><h4>  <a href="https://isometriclove.com/">Isometriclove</a> </h4><br>  We collect the isometry on the template once or twice. <br><br>  Of course, it was possible to get a stock result on Shutterstock or Getty Images, they have long been flooded with the Internet.  The new generation of designers at least gives the integrity of the approach - it is easier to assemble your plot from finished objects. <br><br>  But if you want to express your brand in illustrations, and not just put a plot stub - you need to look for your language.  The article Alice has a small seed on the topic.  Well, <a href="https://vk.com/%40pdigest-illustration-01">in the last issue of the mini-digest there were many examples</a> . <br><br>  Of course, it is useful to study the trends: <a href="https://www.creativebloq.com/features/5-huge-illustration-trends-for-2019">Creative Bloq just released a review</a> .

The main idea is to describe the methods and practices of design management in a patterning format, approximately as usual typical interface solutions.
