You can say - the opening.  Unpleasant  It turned out that in some situations, Android smartphones connected to the AC mains supply (oh) by the charger stop charging.  That is, I had one ‚Äústick‚Äù in my smartphone on the battery indicator, the smartphone hung on charging, say, an hour, I took it off from charging - and one ‚Äústick‚Äù, as it was, remained.  The situation, by the way, is quite vital: it happens if the screen is active and data is being transferred (that is, if you chat in Gtalk, or scroll through pages in the browser, or dig in Facebook - in short, do what modern smartphones are for) .  I was indignant and began to experiment further.  It turned out that smartphones in this situation are not just <i>not charging</i> , but also <i>discharging</i> .  That is, if the smartphone is completely ‚Äúon the light bulb‚Äù and has already warned that the battery life is ‚Äú5% or less left‚Äù - and you put it on charge, without stopping to chat, after a while (after 15 minutes at best) the gadget chuckling reproachfully, shut down.  To clear my conscience, I tried several models, and I came to the conclusion that this happens mainly with devices on the Snapdragon platform, and the Android version does not matter.

    <a name="habracut"></a>  No, you think about it.  Not only are modern, coolest and most expensive smartphones under normal, in general, the load does not work autonomously and daylight hours, so they are also discharged faster than they charge!  Dear smartphone manufacturers, do not you think that this is an actual problem that needs to be solved as soon as possible?  And I will thank you, and millions of smartphone users will thank you, and Time magazine will write a good article about you, and the Internet will be filled with glee, and the sun will look out from behind the clouds, and people will smile at each other, and the world will be a little better. <br><br>  On the nose, <a href="http://www.nomobile.ru/">Mobile World Congress</a> and all the Gadzhetmans lick, anticipating a rich harvest of announcements.  Vendors add fuel to the fire and are <a href="http://www.nomobile.ru/special-project/101869.html">teasing with</a> might and main and <a href="http://www.nomobile.ru/special-project/103767.html">spoilers</a> .  Everyone already knows what is being announced and when, and the trends are obvious. <br><br>  The company LG, for example, which year rushes about, trying to grope and occupy a monetary niche in the market of smartphones.  Last year, for example, we saw the world's first phone with an Intel Atom processor (alas, it remained a concept), and in this we will be pleased <a href="http://www.nomobile.ru/special-project/102710.html">with a smartphone with a 3D screen</a> .  An interesting novelty.  What about a cool Android smartphone that will work for two days without recharging? <br><br>  Sony Ericsson, exhaling (‚Äúlive another brand!‚Äù), Hurries to new heights and is teased by the new <a href="http://www.nomobile.ru/special-project/103767.html">Xperia Play</a> .  I want to believe that the SE took into account all the mistakes of Nokia with N-Gage (and indeed, they learned some experience from all the countless attempts of other companies to make a ‚Äúgaming phone‚Äù), that there will be enough games for this smartphone, and that this whole story will have at least some relation to the Sony PSP and NGP ecosystem.  I believe in Sony Ericsson, but I do not need a gaming smartphone, but I need a smartphone that does not need to be charged twice a day. <br><br>  Here is Nokia, which, according to analysts, both the naked king and the colossus with clay feet, are also going to surprise us - this time it's nice.  The fans held their breath, skeptics raised an eyebrow: did the Finns finally finish their MeeGo-smartphone with an Intel processor?  By the way, is this the very MeeGo-smartphone with an Intel processor - will it also ask to the outlet right after noon? <br><br>  And all these multi-core - on the <a href="http://www.nomobile.ru/media/101176.html">Nvidia Tegra 2</a> and all that - smartphones, which, of course, will show both HTC and Samsung?  With them, at least it will be possible to get to the office, or will these incredibly productive devices capable of reproducing 1080p HD video and reliably calculate the physics of the Evil Bird flying to the Green Swine, will they ‚Äúdie‚Äù still in the subway? <br><br>  Distorted wacky.  And only one conclusion should be drawn from it: it is much more sensible to get yourself a simple and tenacious ‚Äúdialer‚Äù for communication and a tablet with a powerful battery - for everything else.  So, the era of "big smartphones" ends?  For me, absolutely.  Until they start charging faster than they discharge. <br><br>  <i>Alexey Goncharov</i> <br><br>  More information about Mobile World Congress 2011 at <a href="http://www.nomobile.ru/">Nomobile.Ru</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/113589/">https://habr.com/ru/post/113589/</a></p>
