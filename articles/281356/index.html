In fact, if more than two people are responsible for the process in the box, easy chaos is provided for you, and with an increase in the number of those involved, an exponential increase in entropy is ensured.  :) <br><br>  The process of managing an organization is a set of actions repeated over time, with a specific beginning and end, the purpose of which is to create value for external and internal customers.  In fact - the transformation of resources at the entrance to the product at the output, the product can be any - both tangible and intangible knowledge.  Conversion in a box can be extremely simple, does not require decomposition, and can be very complex, involving a lot of staff and time, having many conditions and dependencies.  The question of the level of decomposition of the process lies in the plane of rationality, expediency and common sense, I like the methodological principle of "Occam's Razor", which says that "It is not necessary to involve new entities without extreme necessity", where you can do without formalizing the action - to formalize action is not worth it.  :) <br><a name="habracut"></a>

    <h4>  <b>The essence of the matter</b> </h4><br>  Easy immersion in the theory ended, back to our case.  We have a manufacturing enterprise, which, like all others, in addition to the main product, produces a marriage, where without it.  And there is a Quality Department (OC) at that enterprise, the purpose of whose existence is to fix a marriage, to promote elimination, to prevent and stop in every possible way.  Yes, that there the Quality Department, the whole Quality Management System (QMS), is implemented at the enterprise, conforming and certified according to ISO 9001. It would seem, there is OK, there is QMS, all the processes are written on paper, everything corresponds to the international level, do not work want! <br><br>  But!  The act of marriage or the act of admission control can go a month or two, taking into account weekends and holidays between departments and employees of the enterprise.  How so?  The act of entrance control, getting to the legal adviser, was already late for drawing up a claim to the supplier, all the deadlines for the delivery contract for returning were issued.  And how many such cases?  And how many acts do we have at work?  And at what stage are they?  And at what stage do they get stuck the most?  Which unit generates more defects?  And who is the culprit?  And who eliminates more often?  Which supplier has worse quality?  And how many claims sent to suppliers and without an answer?  What are the costs we incur?  And many other questions.  We will analyze paper logs and folders with acts, explanatory, costing? <br><br><h4>  <b>What to do?</b> </h4><br>  - And let us, instead of paper journals, make acts electronic, will we create a sequential process of working on an act? <br>  - Let's! <br>  - We have SharePoint, is it right? <br>  - Of course! <br>  - The whole process has already been described here, we just need to move. <br>  - Easily! <br>  As you can see, the solution was found quickly and the work began to boil. <br><br><h4>  <b>Documentation!</b> </h4><br>  Having learned from bitter experience, I will say one seemingly obvious thing that I will not even argue with anyone about, I just say it as a fact - always start an automation project by developing a process flowchart, make a detailed document describing the scheme along the way and never start development without these agreed documents! <br><ul><li>  Firstly, it will help you in the decomposition of the process, i.e.  in the development itself, the visual presentation will allow better systematization of actions, taking into account a maximum of conditions and dependencies. </li><li>  Secondly, these two documents are required to form the basis of the terms of reference, therefore it is necessary to involve the process owner and sponsor in the work on them, and best of all those involved in the process.  Be sure to convene a meeting when you think that everything is ready for the project - it's time to transfer from paper to devil-machine.  Discuss all the stages and states of the process, all possible branches, most likely you have not considered everything.  It is better to take into account at the design stage so that you do not have to change the foundation of the finished house. </li></ul><br>  You can not believe me and work without a scheme and a detailed description, infinitely changing the process under the new brilliant ideas of the participants. <br><br><h4>  <b>Reengineering!</b> </h4><br>  Another point is that you should not completely rely on the competence of the process owner and expect him to become your main consultant.  Your common sense should be your main consultant.  All actions of the process, all dependencies and conditions should be questioned - ask questions "Why?", "What is the reason for this?", "Can we refuse it?".  The easier your process will turn out - the more chances it has to start and remain efficient in an organizational sense.  It is also likely that the process will have to be transformed, taking into account the technical features of the chosen automation platform.  Your task is to optimize the process, make it maximally human-independent, transparent, manageable and time-limited to achieve maximum efficiency.  This is called reengineering.  Occam's razor to help you! <br><br><h4>  <b>Go!</b> </h4><br>  Having studied the process of managing acts of marriage, described in the QMS and examining the physical process, it became clear that everything is not so simple. <br>  The process is described very poorly and in general terms, but physically it turned out to be very complex - at every step the new condition ‚ÄúIF‚Äù and every new step draws new dependencies. <br><br>  Putting two physical processes on the scheme - the act of marriage and the act of input control, it turned out that they are almost identical - they use the same data, the same actions, and differ slightly in the output.  So, it is not necessary to produce unnecessary entities - we unite! <br><br>  There were a lot of such moments. Along the way, we informed all the participants involved in the process about all the changes, and, probably, after the tenth variant of the process, we decided with the owner and everything that everything was ready, the option was final, it was possible to finish and run. <br>  We decided to convene a meeting, inviting everyone involved to tell and demonstrate, walking through all the stages, how the new process will work, where and whose responsibility.  And they immediately found out with the legal adviser that it is very desirable that the stage of processing the claim to the supplier under the act of incoming control be monitored and, in the event of a refusal or partial refusal, in the event of the expiration of the allotted time, involved in the work of the legal adviser and only In some cases, the processing of a claim is an absolutely ordinary process.  And then they found out that the stage of processing the claim after negotiations with the supplier can change the decision on the act from returning to the supplier to, say, a correction on its own with partial reimbursement of costs by the supplier.  Various trifles were also taken into account, it seems, of the requirements and wishes of the accounting department on the printed form of the act and the live signatures, the wishes of the chief engineer for the automatic creation of the claim. <br><br>  Either the eleventh, or the twelfth version turned out to be the final one and another meeting fully approved it.  By the way, without a scheme your meetings would be boring - the participants simply would not understand you, would leave and agree, they say, "Let's do it, but we'll see." <br><br><h4>  <b>Boring technical part</b> </h4><br>  I'll tell you a little about how the process is implemented technically. <br>  In the SharePoint site, <b>custom lists</b> have been created that are used as journals or reference books.  Links between them are provided by using lookup columns and workflows. <br><br>  Standard <b>forms</b> have been improved through SharePoint Designer and new ones have been created, for example, accumulation of connected data in the form of viewing the marriage certificate, the printed form of the act or the printed form of the claim to the supplier. <br>  Customizing the display of forms is an extensive question and has the same set of solutions.  For example, you can simply hide certain fields in different forms with the parameters ShowInDisplayForm, ShowInEditForm, ShowInNewForm.  There are many applications for setting parameters - for example, SharePoint Manager.  For convenience, some fields can be displayed in the edit form, but you can assign the Disabled attribute to an element using simple Javascript.  <i>In general, Javascript always saves, for example, you need to create a comment while being in the contract viewing card, or executing on a job memo, press the ‚ÄúCreate‚Äù button, in which you pass the ID of the current element to the form of creating a new element.</i>  <i>The script takes the ID and select the desired value in the Input element.</i> <br>  You can also create from scratch any forms in SharePoint Designer, and someone might like InfoPath. <br>  In the 2007 and 2010 versions, you can use the Office Toolbox extension, where everything is simple and convenient to be ticked, including the field can be displayed in the edit form, but Read Only. <br><br>  Workflows are created through the SharePoint Designer.  Workflows provide both the business process itself and data consistency in some cases. <br>  In 2007, SharePoint versions sometimes help Useful Sharepoint Designer Custom Workflow Activities, for example, when after editing you need to leave only read permissions for an item.  In the 2010-2013 versions there are no such problems - everything is out of the box, in general, in the new versions, the presence of an impersonation step somewhat changes the approach to the design of the process logic - considerably simplifying. <br>  Restriction of stages in time is organized by creating an additional workflow with a timer, which waits for the allotted time and after its expiration checks for filling in the required fields.  If everything is bad, set ‚ÄúDeviation equals Yes‚Äù and sends notifications to all interested parties.  For better visualization, you can add a hyperlink type field to which you can write links to standard indicator pictures, for example, a created one that requires a reaction ‚Äî a yellow icon, a timely filled-in element ‚Äî green, and a deviation ‚Äî respectively, red. <br><br><h4>  <b>The process is ready!</b> </h4><br>  This is how our documentation looks like, which was put into effect by order: <br><br>  <b>Diagram of the process of dealing with marriage acts</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3f7/504/07e/3f750407e84d4709a61b12fd0a128ada.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Regulations work with acts of marriage</b> <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Full text</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><h4>  <b>Regulations work with acts of marriage</b> </h4><br><br><h5>  <b>Terms and Definitions</b> </h5><br>  <b>Controller</b> - the person responsible for quality control taken at the production and suppliers of finished products, materials, raw materials (controller or head of quality department). <br>  <b>Economist</b> - the person responsible for planning and the actual calculation of material and labor costs (economist normalizer or head of the financial and economic department). <br>  <b>The technical department</b> is the person responsible for the design and technological preparation of production (Chief Designer, Chief Technologist or Deputy). <br>  <b>Accountant</b> - the person responsible for the accounting of production costs and payroll calculation (accountant for production, cost, salary or Chief Accountant). <br>  <b>Chief Engineer</b> - a person who has the right to sign documents, in his absence - a person acting as the chief engineer. <br>  <b>The list</b> is a spreadsheet (journal) with columns, where each row (record) is a separate element. <br>  <b>A list item is a list</b> string with a unique identifier that may contain attachments of documents, have limited user access rights, and run workflows. <br>  <b>Workflow (RP)</b> is a program that determines the logic of actions and is performed automatically upon the occurrence of certain events, such as the creation or modification of an element / document in the list, the occurrence of a specified date. <br><br><h5>  <b>general description</b> </h5><br>  To organize the process of managing electronic marriage acts, the lists of the ‚ÄúQuality Department‚Äù node of the enterprise portal are used, located at <a href="https://portal.domain.ru/SiteDirectory/quality">portal.domain.ru/SiteDirectory/quality</a> <br>  Lists can be presented as paper logs, where there are lines and fields to fill in, each line is a unique entry that has attributes.  The difference is that the entry in the electronic list can have attachments, run workflows to automate actions, for example, send a notification, change any value, entries in the list can be dynamically sorted, grouped, calculated any attribute values ‚Äã‚Äãand sum up. <br>  Using the specified lists, as well as automated action logic, configured through the use of programmable workflows, processes for managing electronic marriage acts (non-conformity) have been created. <br><br><h5>  <b>The processes of registration and processing of acts of marriage</b> </h5><br><h5>  <b>1. Creation of the Act by the controller</b> </h5><br>  For registration of acts, a list of ‚ÄúActs of marriage‚Äù (https://portal.domain.ru/SiteDirectory/quality/Lists/List) was created.  The registration of marriage acts is carried out by the controller of the quality department in accordance with the rules adopted in the organization. <br><br>  When you create an entry in the "Act of marriage" are filled in the following fields: <br>  Input control - select Yes / No (indicates Yes if there is a discrepancy in the input control of materials and finished products from an external supplier) <br>  Detected - selection of a workshop where a discrepancy is detected (mandatory) <br>  Occurred - selection of the workshop where a discrepancy occurred (mandatory) <br>  Controller - choice of the name of the responsible controller of the quality department (mandatory) <br>  Products - the name of non-compliant products (mandatory) <br>  Quantity - the number of non-conforming products (mandatory) <br>  Non conformance - detailed description of product non conformance (mandatory) <br>  Itinerary / Operation / Worker - transfer of production characteristics (mandatory) <br>  Note - optional text field <br><br>  The record may also have file attachments (photos, drawings, documents). <br><br>  When editing a record, the same fields are available as during creation. <br><br><h5>  <b>2. Decision making JCC</b> </h5><br>  After registration of the marriage certificate, an item is automatically created in the ‚ÄúDecisions on marriage‚Äù list (https://portal.domain.ru/SiteDirectory/quality/Lists/List6) and a notification is sent to the quality department. <br>  The quality manager or responsible engineer must make a decision. <br>  When you change an entry in the ‚ÄúDecisions on marriage‚Äù list, the following fields are filled in: <br>  Solution - selection of values ‚Äã‚Äãfrom the ‚ÄúSolutions‚Äù directory (https://portal.domain.ru/SiteDirectory/quality/Lists/List7) Return to supplier / Correction / Retreat / Disposal (mandatory) <br>  Elimination Workshop - selection of values ‚Äã‚Äãfrom the ‚ÄúDivisions‚Äù directory (https://portal.domain.ru/SiteDirectory/quality/Lists/List1) (mandatory) <br>  Correction - description of measures to eliminate inconsistencies (mandatory) <br><br>  When viewing an item, the following fields are available: <br>  Decided - the account of the employee of the quality department who made the decision on the nonconformity, the field is filled automatically after saving the item <br>  Deadline - within 4 business hours of receipt of the notification. <br><br><h5>  <b>3. Defining corrective actions</b> </h5><br>  After registration of the marriage certificate, an item is automatically created in the ‚ÄúCorrective actions‚Äù list (https://portal.domain.ru/SiteDirectory/quality/Lists/List11) and a notification is sent to the head of the department where the discrepancy has occurred.  The status of the Act is changed to "Decision of the head of the JCC". <br><br>  The head of the unit must respond by filling in the required fields. <br><br>  When you change an entry in the ‚ÄúDecisions on marriage‚Äù list, the following fields are filled in: <br><br>  The cause of the mismatch is the choice of value from the ‚ÄúMismatch‚Äù reference book (https://portal.domain.ru/SiteDirectory/quality/Lists/List5) <br>  The culprit - name of the artist or supplier name <br>  Corrective actions - measures taken or planned to prevent similar inconsistencies in the future <br><br>  When viewing an item, the following fields are available: <br>  Decided - the account of the head of the department where the discrepancy occurred, who made the decision on the inconsistency, the field is filled automatically after saving the item <br>  Deadline - within 16 working hours of receipt of the notification. <br><br><h5>  <b>4. Coordination of the decision of the Technical Department</b> </h5><br>  After a decision is made on the non-compliance, the head of the quality department automatically creates an item in the ‚ÄúApproval of the decision‚Äù list (https://portal.domain.ru/SiteDirectory/quality/Lists/List9) and sends a notification to the Technical Department head.  The status of the Act is changed to "Coordination of the Technical Department." <br><br>  The head of the Technical Department must agree or reject the solution proposed by the quality department. <br><br>  When changing an entry in the list, the following fields are filled: <br>  Agreed - select Agreed / Declined (mandatory) <br>  Comment - text box with explanations (required) <br><br>  Fields available when viewing a record: <br>  Agreed - the account of the employee of the Technical Department who agreed or rejected the decision on non-compliance, the field is filled in automatically after the item is saved. <br><br>  At the stage of approval of the decision, two scenarios are possible: <br><ul><li>  1. The technical department rejected the proposed solution. <br>  It returns to stage 2 of the workflow when a solution is created for the head of the quality department.  The status of the Act is changed to "Decision of the head of the JCC".  The previous decision is kept for history. </li><li>  2. The technical department agreed on the proposed solution. <br>  Go to stage 5 of the process. <br>  Deadline - within 4 business hours of receipt of the notification. </li></ul><br><br><h5>  <b>5. Costing</b> </h5><br>  After agreeing on the decision, an item is automatically created in the ‚ÄúCosting‚Äù list (https://portal.domain.ru/SiteDirectory/quality/Lists/List8) and sent a notification to the normalizer of the unit selected by the head of the quality department as an eliminator.  The status of the Act is changed to "Costing". <br><br>  An employee of the economic department must perform a cost estimate (material, labor, direct and indirect) associated with this discrepancy, with the implementation of the solution to resolve the discrepancy. <br><br>  The record may also have file attachments (photos, drawings, documents). <br><br>  When changing an entry in the list, the following fields are filled: <br>  Semi-finished products - the sum of the costs of semi-finished products in rubles (mandatory) <br>  Materials - the sum of expenses for materials in rubles (mandatory) <br>  Salary - the amount of wage costs in rubles (mandatory) <br>  Description - text field with explanations (required) <br>  Completed - the logical field Yes / No (Value Yes (tick) is put at the end of the calculation) <br><br>  Fields available when viewing a record: <br>  Pension - the sum of expenses for pension insurance contributions in rubles (calculated field using the formula ‚Äú= ROUND ((Salary * 0.321); 2)‚Äù) <br>  General - the sum of overhead costs in rubles (calculated field using the formula ‚Äú= ROUND ((Salary * 2.18); 2)‚Äù) <br>  Amount - the sum of all expenses in rubles (calculated field using the formula ‚Äú= Semi-finished products + Materials + Salary + Pension + General‚Äù) <br>  Completed - an account of an employee of the economic department who performed costing for nonconformity, the field is filled in automatically after saving the item. <br><br>  Deadline - within 8 working hours of receipt of the notification. <br><br><h5>  <b>5.1 Check conditions</b> </h5><br>  After the calculation is completed, the conditions are checked and the corrective actions are determined from stage 3 of the process. <br><br>  If the definition of corrective actions from stage 3 of the process is not fulfilled, the status of the Act is changed to ‚ÄúDefinition of corrective actions‚Äù. <br><br>  After the determination of corrective actions by the head of the unit where the discrepancy has occurred, two scenarios are possible: <br><ol><li>  Costs are zero. <br>  Transition to stage 5.2 of the process. </li><li>  Costs are greater than zero. <br>  Go to stage 6 of the process. </li></ol><br><br><h5>  <b>5.2 Check conditions</b> </h5><br>  After checking the conditions for compliance with the type of the ‚ÄúInput control‚Äù act and the ‚ÄúReturn to supplier‚Äù JCC solution, 2 scenarios are possible: <br><br><ol><li>  Input control - No. <br>  Go to stage 9 of the process. </li><li>  Input control - Yes. <br>  Transition to stage 8 of the process. </li></ol><br><br><h5>  <b>6. Decision Making by Chief Engineer</b> </h5><br>  After performing the cost estimate, determining the corrective actions, and if the costs are greater than zero, an item is automatically created in the ‚ÄúCost Matching‚Äù list (https://portal.domain.ru/SiteDirectory/quality/Lists/List10) and a notification is sent to the Chief Engineer.  The status of the Act is changed to ‚ÄúCoordination by the Chief Engineer‚Äù. <br><br>  The chief engineer must decide where to include the costs associated with the discrepancy. <br><br>  When changing an entry in the list, the following fields are filled: <br>  To attribute costs - the choice of the value On the culprit / On the production / On the supplier (mandatory) <br>  Comment - text box with explanations (required) <br><br>  Fields available when viewing a record: <br>  Decided - the account of the Chief Engineer who made the decision on the allocation of costs associated with the discrepancy, the field is filled automatically after saving the item. <br><br>  At the stage of approval of the decision, two scenarios are possible: <br><ol><li>  The chief engineer decided to assign the cost of production or perpetrator <br>  Go to stage 7 of the process. </li><li>  The chief engineer decided to charge the cost to the supplier <br>  Transition to stage 8 of the process. </li></ol><br><br>  Deadline - within 4 business hours of receipt of the notification. <br><br><h5>  <b>7.

Claim processing</b> </h5><br>  The head of the unit responsible for this delivery sends the Claim to the supplier, carries out all the necessary activities related to the return of non-conforming products and, based on the results of the work, makes changes to the corresponding entry in the "Results of the claim" list (https://portal.domain.ru/SiteDirectory/quality / Lists / List12). <br><br>  When changing an entry in the list, the following fields are filled: <br>  Claim satisfied - select Yes / No / Partial / Decision cancel (mandatory) <br>  Comment - text box with explanations (required) <br><br>  Fields available when viewing a record: <br>  I made a decision - the account is the Head of the department who reported on the processing of the Claim, the field is filled in automatically after the item is saved. <br><br>  At the stage of processing the claims, there are three possible scenarios: <br><ol><li>  Result of Satisfying Claims - Yes <br>  Go to stage 11 of the process. </li><li>  Result of satisfaction of the Claim - No or Partially <br>  Go to stage 12 process. </li><li>  Result of satisfaction of the Claim - Cancellation <br>  Go to stage 2 process.  All changes are discarded and a new solution is created for the head of the quality department.  The status of the Act is changed to "Decision of the head of the JCC".  The previous decision, costing and all approvals are kept for the history. </li></ol><br>  Term - within 30 days from the date of receipt of the notification. <br><br><h5>  <b>11.
