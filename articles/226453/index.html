Samsung has introduced a new line of flagship tablets GALAXY Tab S - the world's first mobile devices with large diagonal Super AMOLED screens.  The introduction of such displays allowed not only to repeatedly expand the range of reproducible colors, but also to reduce the size, weight and power consumption of the tablet.  What else can we boast?  Follow under the cat! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a44/0ee/7ec/a440ee7ec0b2475bd50534d37a020341.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  <font color="00a8ff">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">IRON</font> </h2><br>  The sizes of the screens of the announced new products are not quite standard - 8.4 and 10.5 inches.  The tablets are equipped with two cameras: a 2.1 megapixel front-facing module and a main 8-megapixel autofocus sensor.  Exynos 5 Octa processors (4 1.9 GHz Ôºã 4 1.3 GHz cores), 3 GB of onboard memory and 4900 and 7900 mAh batteries are responsible for the performance of the tablets, and Mali-T628 will take care of the graphics applications MP6.  Devices are equipped with built-in memory of 16 or 32 GB and slots for microSD memory cards with the ability to expand data storage up to 128 GB.

Well, let's not forget about the wireless interfaces Wi-Fi 802.11ac MIMO and 4G LTE Cat.  4. The tablets are running Android 4.4.2 KitKat with a proprietary interface Magazine UX.  They are one of the thinnest and lightest mobile devices on the market: the case of both models is only 6.6 mm thick, and the weight of new products is 467 grams for the 10.5-inch version and 298 grams for the 8.4-inch one. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d59/b15/bb4/d59b15bb4cde8956ebd990a828789437.png"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b71/35e/2af/b7135e2af734998f316c89c52ac33529.png"><br><h2>  <font color="6BB501">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">SCREEN</font> </h2><br>  Let us take a closer look at the GALAXY Tab S. screen. This is a Super AMOLED with WQXGA resolution (2560x1600, aspect ratio 16:10), covering more than 90% of the Adobe RGB color space.  For comparison, standard LCD panels exhibit color coverage of only about 73% of the Adobe RGB space, and in some cases even less.  Greater color gamut allows the screen to more accurately reproduce clear, rich hues ‚Äî blue, red, green, turquoise, lemon, and other colors.  In this case, in the case of conventional LCD screens, attempts to increase the color gamut either lead to a radical complication of the design, or to an increase in power consumption, Super AMOLED screens, on the contrary, provide good energy efficiency and compactness (because there is no need for a separate backlight module). ).  At the same time, the contrast of the image on the Super AMOLED screen can reach 100,000: 1 ‚Äî this is a hundred times higher than on a conventional LCD screen. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/854/6b1/e13/8546b1e138b1894a73f09585b3666e2c.jpg"><br><br>  In addition, the adaptive screen function is capable of automatically adjusting the brightness and color rendition depending on the brightness and color temperature of the ambient light, as well as how the tablet is used.  By the way, now you don‚Äôt manage to scold the screen for unnaturally bright colors: several color profiles are provided in the settings (AMOLED Basic, AMOLED Photo and AMOLED Cinema), so if the standard settings upset the user with excessive brightness and unnatural color rendering, you can simply choose another mode to your liking .  Since the Super AMOLED technology does not require a separate backlight module, the GALAXY Tab S consumes less power compared to tablets based on LCD screens of comparable diagonals. <br><br><h2>  <font color="ffd800">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">OPPORTUNITIES</font> </h2><br>  What have you learned how to make new tablets?  Firstly, Samsung GALAXY Tab S supports multitasking mode, which allows you to open two applications on the screen at the same time and work comfortably with them.  Simultaneous viewing of video, sharing content and receiving a call from a subscriber will no longer be something unusual - now it will become a daily reality for owners of a new tablet.  It is worth noting the Quick Connect feature, with which the GALAXY Tab S quickly finds and connects to devices nearby for easy content sharing (available on both Wi-Fi and LTE versions). <br><br>  You can not overestimate the usefulness of the new features SideSync 3.0 - a convenient symbiosis, combining your Samsung GALAXY smartphone and GALAXY Tab S tablet into one ecosystem.  First of all, it saves particularly lazy users from having to reach for a smartphone in case of an incoming call or message - SideSync 3.0 will allow you to display the smartphone screen on the tablet screen and answer it immediately.  Transferring files and copying text between two devices, redirecting a phone call or a message from a smartphone to a tablet - all this can now be done in real time over a wireless Wi-Fi network. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e53/15c/3d8/e5315c3d8c6bd83cddb0002f0534a3d1.jpg"><br><br>  Samsung GALAXY Tab S tablets have a special multi-user mode: one device supports up to 8 user profiles, for each of which you can choose individual design options and a list of programs.  For families with small children, there is also the children's mode that has already gained popularity on the Samsung GALAXY S5 - a combination of a beautiful and simple interface, parental control functions for how and for how long the child uses the tablet, as well as reliable protection of data stored on the tablet - from files to lists of calls and messages. <br><br>  The unlocking of the tablet, as well as the protection of personal files and authorization in various systems and services can be done using a fingerprint scanner built into the Home button.  For each of the 8 users, you can register for 3 fingerprints, which provides both convenience and security: unlike a regular password, a fingerprint cannot be overlooked or picked up. <br><br><h2>  <font color="ff0000">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">SERVICES AND APPLICATIONS</font> </h2><br>  Samsung has thoroughly worked on the quantity and quality of free content and applications available in the basic package of new tablets.  The Samsung service for viewing Papergarden magazines will debut on GALAXY Tab S. In addition, GALAXY Gifts should be noted: Samsung has teamed up with many mobile content producers and service providers to offer a huge amount of useful content and services to GALAXY Tab S users.  Thanks to Samsung‚Äôs strategic partnership with Marvel, users of the GALAXY Tab S will be able to become members of the Marvel Unlimited club for three months and, after downloading a special application, access to a collection of more than 15,000 comics. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/72f/a70/47c/72fa7047cf4bb6fc9807fe526a2a77b1.jpg"><br><br>  Kindle for Samsung will offer Samsung GALAXY Tab S tablet users a free book that can be obtained each month through Samsung Book Deals, as well as access to a huge selection of e-books in the Kindle Store.  The new corporate service MILK, which is an analogue of Spotify and Google Music, will select the music for the mood.  In essence, this is Internet radio, which will always be at hand, and the main advantage over competitors is the lack of subscription fees.  Samsung has a long-standing partnership with Google Play, thanks to which users of the GALAXY Tab S will receive a special gift - access to a large selection of movies, entertainment content, various books and magazines. <br><br><h2>  <font color="E97784">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">ACCESSORIES</font> </h2><br>  Together with the new tablet GALAXY Tab S Samsung offers a set of useful accessories. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/863/7de/991/8637de9911122aeee717e667a0e05a12.jpg"><br>  Cover Book Cover allows you to set the tablet at certain angles for solving various problems - about 60 ¬∞ for watching movies, about 30 ¬∞ for working on the Internet, or about 10 ¬∞ for typing and working. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f74/6fa/b24/f746fab24bee0fc916a7fe3983824eca.jpg"><br>  If you just need to carefully store the tablet, but at the same time you want to have the thinnest cover possible - there is Simple Cover, which is easy to install and provides screen protection.  All covers designed specifically for the GALAXY Tab S are fastened with a new snap system - a simple and reliable mechanism. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/01c/8ae/a1a/01c8aea1a4ad6413f7ae5aaaf0bbaa29.jpg"><br>  An ultra-slim ergonomic keyboard that connects via Bluetooth is another accessory designed specifically for the GALAXY Tab S. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9cf/99f/ffb/9cf99fffbde75adc3963a898391552a0.jpg"><br>  For audiophiles, Samsung last month presented a <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/samsung/blog/223623/">series of Level devices</a> , which is fully compatible with new tablets. <br><br><h2>  <font color="0c00ff">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">START</font> <font color="0c00ff">OF</font> <font color="000000">SALES AND PRICES</font> </h2><br>  Samsung GALAXY Tab S will be available in various options: Wi-Fi or Wi-Fi and LTE, 16 or 32 GB of permanent memory.
