  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Practical advice for those who decide to sell through couponers</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  As soon as you got the idea to sell something from the goods through discount services, they are also ‚Äúcouponers‚Äù (grupon, profit, biglion, bigbazzi, kupikupon, etc.), succumbed to the influence of seductive sales statistics of other participants and an attractive description of future thousands of sales from the very first day of placing your stock - take a break from the golden mountains that have appeared in your imagination and move your calculator away. <br><br>  You need to think carefully and weigh all the pros and cons.  I will tell you a few key points that you will have to face and talk about the necessary preparation.  My advice is based on real experience, including failure. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  Prepare technically </h5><br>  If your product is massive and you expect sales of many thousands, first of all create an infrastructure.  Every little thing is important - how will you take orders, are you ready to believe your buyer, despite the fact that he, for example, is color blind, and in your order form you need to choose red and green blocks, whether you are protected from fraud by users , how will you store, sort, process incoming requests at a speed of 6 orders per minute, are your employees trained, and so on.  If you rely on your e-mail and phone as the main means of communication with customers, you will be cared for.

    <h5>  Prepare yourself morally </h5><br>  Suddenly a flurry of clients fell on you - this is of course wonderful and you dream about it, but if you have never been under the onslaught of an avalanche before, even if you are technically prepared for this, be ready to work at the limit of your strengths and opportunities.  Otherwise, you heal. <br><br><h5>  Prepare logistic schemes </h5><br>  The users spoiled by discounts just expect that they will not just buy your goods with a good (in their opinion) discount, but will buy it with delivery.  And do not think that it is not.  Your staff (if any), several couriers in this case will be a good help for a suddenly arisen workflow, no more. <br><br><h5>  Find reliable suppliers </h5><br>  Check your suppliers - personally go to their warehouses and make sure that the goods that you are going to sell really are in warehouses.  Put some thousand units of goods in a separate untouchable corner, enter into a contract and make an advance payment - even if you don‚Äôt sell everything you want - that's what it is in advance.  If you believe your suppliers in a word, you will be cured. <br><br><h5>  Sign contracts with transport companies </h5><br>  Again, make sure personally that your transport partner really is what it claims to be.  Do not be lazy and ask for one day to visit him - see how much transport he has, in what condition he is, who the drivers are.  Sign a contract in which indicate several possible scenarios (small deliveries, medium, and squall).  If you believe in a newspaper ‚Äúfrom hand to hand‚Äù and private offers of transport services, you will be cared for when mass deliveries occur. <br><br><h5>  Do not hurry </h5><br>  Prepare for sales in advance, do not be afraid to lose a month or two to prepare, believe me - the time spent will return almost perfect work and profit. <br><br><h5>  Check everything again </h5><br>  Check the readiness of all links, test the technical part on yourself, familiar and unfamiliar people, cats in the end.  Make sure the printers are loaded, paper and spare cartridges are near each.  And even better if there are just spare printers, just like that - just in case. <br><br>  These are the most general recommendations (there are several important points) for those who decide to sell a lot and efficiently.  Couponers can really help you with this, but if you heal, everyone will hate you - users, couponers, suppliers, logisticians, employees, and you yourself. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/137256/">https://habr.com/ru/post/137256/</a></p>
