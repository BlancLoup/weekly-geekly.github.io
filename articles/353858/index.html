Android and iOS, various topics from multithreading to testing, Russian speakers and foreign stars - we have already <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/jugru/blog/353352/">written</a> about what will be there. <br><br>  But what they haven‚Äôt yet reported: on both days of the conference the online broadcast of the first hall will be free.  It will go on YouTube, so it's convenient to watch anywhere - at least on a smartphone, at least on a TV.  And although nothing can replace a completely personal presence, we try to bring the online experience closer to it.  For example, viewers of a broadcast can write their questions to the speakers in a special chat, and between reports they will see interviews with speakers and inclusions from sponsor stands.  In general, start <a href="https://mobiusconf.com/online-free/">broadcasting</a> on both days on the most convenient screen for you and enjoy!

Felix will talk about what risks are caused by dependency on third-party code, and how a potential attacker can easily add malicious code to your application. </p><br><br clear="all"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6c1/7b4/cdb/6c17b4cdbc9e925677c988c8070affec.jpg" width="200" align="left">  <b>Felix Krause</b> / Google <br><br><p>  Felix is ‚Äã‚Äãthe creator of fastlane, an open source tool for automating tasks related to iOS and Android development.  Since 2015, he is on Twitter, and about a year ago, along with fastlane, he moved to Google.  He recently announced a CI system for mobile developers fastlane.ci, and we then <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/jugru/blog/348986/">interviewed</a> him. </p><br><br clear="all"><hr><br><h1>  12:00 <a href="https://mobiusconf.com/2018/spb/talks/2kbomfvosgmyma0cw26cic">Profiling in examples: looking for a bottleneck</a> </h1><br><p>  Most likely, your application feels great on the last Pixel.  Surely at first.  But how to understand whether it works well enough on other devices?  What to do after finding a problem and how to prevent it from recurring? </p><br><p>  The report is a technical case.  We will not delve into the jungle of optimizations, but we will consider where to start. </p><br><p>  There is an application that works.  There is a feeling that it does not work fast enough.  First, we'll figure out how true this feeling is, using more precise tools than intuition.  Then we ‚Äúdissect‚Äù this application, using several tools one by one, along the way introducing optimization.  Time is limited, so we will focus on parts of the tools: GPU profiler, Hierarchy Viewer, Overdraw display.  Finally, we will look at several tools that allow you to monitor how well the application works from assembly to assembly. </p><br><p>  Of course, a silver bullet does not exist, as well as a universal solution to all problems.  However, in order to solve a problem, you need to find it and localize it.  Understanding ‚Äúwhere we are now‚Äù is an integral part of a successful move forward. </p><br><br clear="all"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4ed/914/fdc/4ed914fdceb3e19e38392865e2843ee5.jpg" width="200" align="left">  <b>Arthur Badretdinov</b> / Vyng <br><br><p>  Considers that every software engineer is a developer, but not every developer is a software engineer.
