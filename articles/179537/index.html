  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Sysadmin to 1C developer</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><h4>  Foreword </h4><br>  This article focuses on zero-level IT professionals, both the 1C platform and specific standard configurations.  This article should answer the question: "Where to start?" <br><br>  My personal path to 1C was original.  Being a programmer of the analytical module of the accounting system (I wrote on vb6), from time to time I took the work of a system administrator, or, more precisely, I performed the functions of an enikeyschik.  In the fourth year of operation, I remained one of the old staff of the IT department, and was responsible for a network of 60 PCs and 5 servers.  The network was built as resilient as possible (due to its laziness, even all software was installed as managed, when adding a PC to a security group), there was nothing to be done.  Where to go?  The skills of primary responsibilities in the organization were not forgotten; therefore, two projects were implemented on VB.NET and C # using the .NET platform.  It was around this time that I started writing small reports for the ‚Äútrade management‚Äù configuration on platform 8.1. <br>  I will not indicate where to read, I will say what to look for to read. <br><br><h4>  Who are 1C programmers? </h4><br>  Probably you can often hear that 1Series are not programmers.  It's funny of course, but I was of the same opinion when I, a 1C programmer, brought a flash drive with viruses to the system administrator.  It didn‚Äôt fit in my head that an IT specialist could afford the luxury of viruses on a flash drive.  Later it became clear to me that having run around 2-3 organizations and copying new reports to them, the flash drive must be cleaned.  In general, it happens that it is difficult to call programmers of other platforms.  Different platforms?  Programming language in Russian?  This is just the syntax and capabilities of the platform, about which you either know or not, and if you know, then you either know how to work with them or you don‚Äôt know how.  And now I dare to classify 1C programmers and divide them into three categories: <br><ul><li>  Accountants </li><li>  1C programmers of a particular subject area </li><li>  "Programmers" </li></ul>  Although the first category belongs to a specific subject area, I nevertheless selected them into a separate category.  What is most interesting, this category often does not even write anything.  Yes, they can write, but why?  They are hired by organizations in the accounting department before closing the month when the accounting department has a general low level of competence in its subject area.  Yes, these programmers know accounting.  I do not think that the reader of this article, who wondered: "Where to start?", Will fall into the first category, although anything can happen in 10 years, it is quite possible. <br>  I cannot describe the first category of programmers without quoting Andrey Orlov and his ‚Äúautomaton notes‚Äù.  He's writing: <br>  <i>For example, I pretty well understand the technology of a warehouse, shop and wholesale, that is, I speak fluently managerial, warehouse, programmer and Russian languages.</i>  <i>In these languages ‚Äã‚ÄãI understand their speakers, I can formulate my thoughts and, most importantly, think for myself.</i>  <i>But for me accounting language is foreign.</i>  <i>I understand what is written on it by others, if I strain myself, and I myself can write posting templates for a business transaction, but I cannot get ideas in this language.</i> <br>  And he gives an example of such an idea: <br>  <i>We do not need a separate system for monitoring the execution of orders, everything can be done in the ‚ÄúAccounting‚Äù module of our system: when an order is given, the date of the report on the order is a fine posting for the responsible person, and if he randomly executes the order, the posting is reversed.</i> <br>  In order to become a programmer from the first category, you need to know accounting and period, the rest is syntax, Google and creativity. <br>  The second category is programmers who know specific configurations, or rather a specific type of accounting: warehouse, catering, production.  I think someone who has read the article will work in this direction should strive in this category (not forgetting of course, pass the third category).  Actually here decides the experience, experience with a specific configuration and work in a particular subject area.  If you are a system administrator and there are such configurations in your organization, then it‚Äôs time for you to start. <br>  Third category.  As they say: "Welcome."  Here we will rivet the molds, build reports that work for several hours, we will make a smart face and strain the Google server. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  What to expect? </h4><br>  Let's better what not to expect. <br>  No need to wait for a clear technical assignment, forget about it at all, or you yourself write and approve it yourself, or you will not have it. <br>  Do not expect a quick start and a good payment.  You need experience, experience is payment, but for now (as I wrote above, if you are a system administrator, and there are accounting systems in the organization on the 1C platform), take work so you can work on a bowl of soup. <br>  Do not expect the support of other programmers, your assistants at this stage are people who know the subject area, for example, in warehouse accounting - this is the warehouse manager, if you have a warehouse accounting system, then the warehouse manager should become your friend and friend for the coming year.  Why year?  I think, comparing the proposed compensation packages of your region, that after a year of training, it will be possible to look for a place with a larger compensation package than the package of the system administrator.

    <h4>  Fast start </h4><br><h5>  Administration 1C bases </h5><br>  In order to start training to write code, you should be able to create at least a file database. <br><ul><li>  It is necessary to understand clearly what the 1C platform is and what the 1C configuration is, there are versions, both the platform and the configuration </li><li>  Differences file and server mode.  Try to create databases of both types. </li><li>  Try to read and understand the differences in the configuration modes of ‚ÄúNormal Application‚Äù and ‚ÄúManaged‚Äù </li></ul><br><h5>  Acquaintance with the main objects </h5><br>  In the network there are many resources where you can read, watch.  At this stage, it will be sufficient to familiarize yourself with such objects as reference books, documents, information registers and accumulation registers.  No need to be scared, these are all ordinary tables that have different properties and methods for the convenience of solving a certain range of automation tasks.  Do not forget that 1C language is a problem-oriented language. <br><habracut><br><h5>  Learning query language </h5><br>  At this stage, I would advise you to move away from 1C and start learning SQL.  Here it is necessary to understand, to study operators a little, you need to be able to use them.  I would advise you to <a href="http://sql-ex.ru/">go through the</a> training stage on sql-ex.ru, or at least 50 percent. <br><br><h5>  The study of the subject area of ‚Äã‚Äãautomation </h5><br>  There are two ways to go, to study the system that is implemented in your organization, but there is a second one about it in conclusion.  If you have a warehouse, then go ask questions, how the goods move, what documents are used.  If there is documentation from the system implementers - this is very good, read.  Make yourself a base for tests, try to complete tasks. <br><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4><br>  The writing of this article was prompted by questions from system administrators, namely, one and the main question: ‚ÄúWhere to start?‚Äù I also made some videos for automation by system administrators of my own subject area.  The simplest thing is to learn how to automate the subject area, which you know, I tried to show in the video how to do it.  There is also the fourth category of 1C programmers, but more on that later ... <br><br><h4>  Video </h4><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/aRwAqpLPtt0%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjC-iQqALmYVvJaEfRs1Tpq-xC4Fg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/-qbKTKSG4Eg%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhglYOvU_JPsuYRqooAcmrLZBDqyDQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/18f8tEWPo5U%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhwpaWSWj3yrqa5yv_MLKo6hWHQaQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/1wiT1rruBvA%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhh_diGEaIHEoeFwZGSl4zioGZDmpA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/Gdot1F1TdCM%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhj8a7fWBO9JRJtSacEf-wI5h6iCWA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ls-GEBscMgY%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhOS1sxaPTpAlVVeQztLl9LwkeeYA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/179537/">https://habr.com/ru/post/179537/</a></p>
