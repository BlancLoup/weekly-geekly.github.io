    <a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  FROM ACCEPTING A DECISION ON OBTAINING A CERTIFICATE OF EDS TO A CONCLUSION OF A STATE CONTRACT WILL TAKE A MORE AT LEAST MONTH </h3><br>  So, what to do, how long it will take and how much it costs. <br><br><h3>  Step 1. Obtaining an EDS </h3><br>  Duration: 1 to 5 days <br>  Actions: selection of certification center, preparation of documents, application, payment, visit to the office of certification center for obtaining digital signature <br><br>  It is necessary to receive the certificate of the EDS in the authorized certifying center.  The lists of authorized certification centers are published on each federal electronic trading platform.  Any certification center from these lists is authorized on all five federal sites.  The cost of the EDS certificate and the necessary software is about ten thousand rubles.  It is necessary to fill out an application in the form of the certifying center and submit a fresh notarized extract from the Register, as well as a copy of the document confirming the authority of the manager or power of attorney confirming the authority of the owner of the EDS certificate.  The SP is sufficient to submit a notarized copy of the extract from the EGRIP and the passport.  Sometimes the certification center may require other documents, such as a copy of the statute. <br><br><h3>  Step 2. Install the necessary software </h3><br>  Duration: from 30 minutes to several hours <br>  Installation can be performed by certification center specialists. <br>  There is a free software (crypto-provider) that you can download. <br><br><h3>  Step 3. Accreditation at federal electronic trading platforms </h3><br>  Duration: from 5 working days <br>  A unique case - 60 (!) Working days in connection with the appeal against the denial of accreditation <br><br>  For potential state order suppliers this service is free if there is a certificate of EDS obtained in an accredited certification center and a properly configured computer. <br><br>  Official government procurement portal: <br>  <a href="http://zakupki.gov.ru/">zakupki.gov.ru</a> <br><br>  Official sites of federal trading platforms: <br>  <a href="http://www.sberbank-ast.ru/">Sberbank-AST</a> <a href="http://sberbank-ast.ru/Docs/%25D0%259E%25D1%2580%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B0%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F%2520%25D0%25B8%2520%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5.pdf">instruction</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.rts-tender.ru/">RTS-Tender</a> <a href="http://rts-tender.ru/HtmlView/HtmlView.aspx%3FItemId%3D24%26k%3Dp">manual</a> <br>  <a href="http://etp.zakazrf.ru/">Order RF</a> <a href="http://zakazrf.ru/File.ashx%3Fid%3D97">instruction</a> <br>  <a href="http://etp.roseltorg.ru/">Roseltorg - EETP</a> <a href="http://etp.roseltorg.ru/suppliers/info/get-accreditation/">instruction</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.etp-micex.ru/">MICEX</a> <a href="http://www.etp-micex.ru/organisation/supplier/">instruction</a> <br><br>  Here begins the first difficulties that need to be addressed in a short time. <br>  The sites require strict observance of their regulations, and the forms for accreditation and peculiarities of software customization at each site are different.  Information with varying degrees of detail and readability is published on official websites.  There are often discrepancies in the 94-FZ law and the requirements of the site.  Terms in which sites consider applications also vary.  But the most paradoxical is that the documents that meet the requirements of some sites are rejected by others.  All documents are submitted in electronic form, scans are best done in pdf so that the file size does not exceed 5 MB. <br><br>  You can quickly resolve issues in case of refusal of accreditation by e-mail and through feedback forms, and some sites even provide the opportunity to communicate with operators by phone. <br><br><h3>  DO NOT CALCULATE FOR PASSING ACCREDITATION FIRST TIME </h3><br>  Passage of accreditation sometimes lasts longer than 5 working days, according to the regulations.  Companies that clearly understand the timing of the competition should be taken into account.  It often makes sense to entrust the passage of accreditation to a third-party organization that deals with this professionally.  These are acceptable amounts, as a rule, not exceeding several thousand rubles, given that accreditation is given for 3 years. <br><br><h3>  Step 4. Selection of the competition, study of the tender documentation </h3><br>  In addition to time-consuming, a certain skill is required.  Recently, the government procurement portal, which publishes information on all state order tenders, works quite well.  Thoughtful analysis of the tender documentation will reduce the risk of participation in the competition, which will cause you losses. <br><br>  There are a sufficient number of examples of obtaining negative experience of participating in obviously unprofitable projects.  In addition, there are cases of improper reading of the requirements of the tender documentation, and as a result - the fulfillment of unfavorable conditions, therefore, the recommendation of a professional, his study of the tender documentation of the auction you are interested in is the key to the company's success. <br><br><h3>  Step 5. Transfer of financial support of the application to the electronic trading platform account </h3><br>  Duration: from 1 to 2 banking days <br>  Difficulties: finding financial support for an application or a company that is ready to provide it <br><br>  Participation in the competition is possible only if there is money in the special account of the bidder to secure an application for participation in the competition.  Usually this amount ranges from 2 to 5% of the initial contract price.  When applying, this money is blocked on the account and is subject to mandatory return at the end of the competition.  The winner of the competition shall be charged an amount covering the cost of the site services (up to several thousand rubles).  It should be borne in mind that at some sites money appears on the account only after 2 days (banking day + business day) and nothing can be done about it. <br><br>  While there is no money in the special account of the electronic trading platform, it is impossible to submit a bid.  The site will block the submission of documents. <br><br><h3>  Step 6. Preparation of the first and second parts of applications and submission for participation in the competition </h3><br>  Duration: 1 to 6 hours <br>  Difficulties: compliance with all requirements for the design of applications <br><br>  So, the money on a special account, you can proceed to the application.  This action is significantly different from submitting an application for a paper competition.  The application consists of two parts, but they will be available to the customer and the competition commission at different times. <br><br><h3>  Step 7. Consideration of the first parts of applications by the commission </h3><br>  Duration: from 3 to 5 days <br><br>  The first part of the application is considered by the competition committee prior to the beginning of the competition, after which a decision is made on the admission of the company to participate in the competition. <br><br><h3>  Step 8. Electronic bidding procedure </h3><br>  Duration: 10 minutes to 48 hours <br>  Difficulties: difficult to sit at the computer for 48 hours <br><br>  One should not mention the heat of passions and tension - everything is clear, as sometimes the cost of the competition can be equal to the annual turnover of the company.  Of course, each participant knows in advance the approximate cost of their services or goods, to which he is ready to bargain.  But if the participant made a mistake at the crucial moment, the cancellation of the bet will not work.  It is very convenient when the contest is conducted by an performer from the side who understands well the principle of the auction and knows the extreme price. <br><br><h3>  Step 9. Consideration of the second part of applications by the commission </h3><br>  Duration: 4 to 6 days depending on the amount of the contract <br><br>  The second part of the application becomes available for consideration by the commission after the electronic bidding, on the basis of which the final decision is made about which of the participants will be contracted. <br><br><h3>  LITTLE TO WIN A COMPETITION OFFERING THE BEST PRICE.  MUST CONFIRM YOUR OPPORTUNITIES TO PERFORM A CONTRACT </h3><br>  If the technical winner, the company that offered the best price, will be recognized, upon consideration of the second part of the applications, unable to fulfill the order, then the contract will be concluded with the participant whose second part of the application fully complies with the requirements of the tender documentation. <br><br><h3>  YOU WON </h3><br>  Punctually go through the procedure of signing the contract - relax early.  There are pitfalls here.  Your competitors still have chances, because an incorrectly signed, not-on-time sent contract or an Internet connection failure during signing can all play a fatal role.  Understanding the order of action in case of force majeure comes with experience, and an error can result in not only the loss of the contract‚Äôs collateral value, but also the company's entry into the rogue vendor registry, which automatically excludes the company from the ETP supplier roster for 3 years. <br><br><h3>  FOR DETAILS - TO US </h3><br>  Come, read, ask for help! <br>  <a href="http://www.cipher-link.com/">www.cipher-link.com</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/124943/">https://habr.com/ru/post/124943/</a></p>
