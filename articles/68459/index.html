  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Reset of goods in Russian, results</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Well, it was 2 crazy promotions sales of laptops that organized Euroset and Eldorado. <br>  I'll tell you how it was. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  August 30, 16:00 Sunday, City shopping center, 2nd floor Eldorado.  Laptops Acer eMachines G620-623G25Mi are being sold for 9999 rubles. <br>  Frankly, I myself was not there, I will say what my friends told me. <br>  Before the opening of a huge crowd, everyone is waiting.  Doors opened sale began.  The bottom line was this.  You need to grab a certificate for a laptop to run to pay for it and return for a beech. <br>  The bottom line is that of course the poor managers who distribute these certificates were literally crushed, a distraught crowd rushed through the certificates and rushed to pay for them, but the Russian people are famous for their wit.  Those who did not get the certificate were not confused, they grabbed the beeches and ran to the checkout, shouting "lost \ snatched \ I don‚Äôt know what kind of certificate the beech is punched here." By itself, the security measures did not withstand the crowds, the sellers hid under the counters.  As far as I know, a lot of people suffered under the feet of the crowd, 2 people were hospitalized.  It seems the sale of beeks in the end was suspended. <br><br>  And now September 1st.  <a href="http://enikei.habrahabr.ru/blog/68107/">Euroset sells Rover</a> about it was written.  And today he became a participant in the action.  After all, I also want a laptop and the date is good.  The working day, September 1, all parents with their children in school.  Go buy it! <br>  But it turned out not so ... <br>  Arriving at 7:00 in Dobryninskaya, I took 70th place in the queue (the first people in the queue themselves began to write people into the notebook by last name.) And the fun 3 hours of jokes went in the queue.  At about 9, the manager came out and cheered the people with the phrase: ‚ÄúThere will be a lottery, go by 3 people, pull the coupon, they bring you a laptop, you want to take it, no, you leave.  There will be no choice. ‚ÄùOf course, the cheerful shouts of the crowd did not bother anyone.  The fear of the fact that the models declared for satay will not be justified much, well, we‚Äôll still stand for nothing.  By itself, 3-4 hours in the queue is not easy and the people began to leave the queue to smoke / eat / drink because the surname was written down and eventually ended up at the end of the crowd.  By the time of the start of sales, the same manager shouted that there would be no lotteries, they would just put laptops in the center of the room and you would choose, I lost everything in my soul like 70 ... I understood that 70 normal models would not be exact.  Launched by 3 people checked the names and numbers, all civilized (security 2 uncles from the protection is not in shape), of course those who are at the top of the list, but the end of the queue started to worry and be outraged.  Shouts and excitement began, but it seemed that there was no crush.  (of course, it doesn‚Äôt turn around but is tolerable) Most of all, it grieved that the sellers didn‚Äôt rush people, three people could choose beeches for 20 minutes. <br>  About an hour later, when 20 people were already out, the cheerful manager ran out with a shout that 70 laptops were left, those who were at number 100 dropped their heads BUT DON'T GET OUT!  There were even people at number 150. <br>  An hour later, the same manager announced that 150 laptops were left on Tverskoy and a queue of 30 people (and we had exactly the opposite), and it turned out even to check, there were actually fewer people, although literally 2 hours ago the crowd was more than ours .  And by the way there was a lottery there and it was possible to pull out a happy Noutilus. <br>  And killed 2 facts. <br>  1. A solid young man with a pretty girl was a little stupid (or she used to be on the spot) and she signed up as a result.  Ie nobody will let him inside.  If you saw his eyes when he tried to explain which laptop to choose from a pile of boxes on which the sticker specifications.  He listed the processor \ hard disk \ RAM \ NEVER THE CASE of the BUILT-IN VIDEO CARD, explained it long and dreary, and after all this, she asked, AND IF THESE THINGS ARE THERE WON'T?  a voice from behind prompted "Do not take."  Citizens tell me why you are sending your weaker sex to such events?  to get a call and ask for half an hour what to do?  Oh, and these girls I counted 6 ahead of me. <br>  2. What is the Ukrainian company of 2-3 married couples with friends (and about 9 people) came to buy the laptops.  What is a laptop knew only 1 of them.  In short, he worked as a manager, he waited for his company inside and shoved a box for everyone.  It lasted almost an hour, and this is only 9 people. <br>  My 70-room was invited already inside about 12 hours.  the boxes with 14-15 inch rovers were very sad, 40-80 GB hard disk, 1.4-1.8 GHz Tseleron 2 duo processors, integrated video cards, 512 MB-2 GB RAM.  The only model that could be watched was <a href="http://www.roverbook.ru/shop/roverbook/roverbook/item_1992/">Rover B510,</a> not with Linux, but with Vista. <br>  As it turned out, the declared models were about 10 pieces, they were received by people who took the place since yesterday evening.  Who defended about 10 hours, well done guys, if I had not thought that there would be an auction and was not in a hurry where it was possible, too, I arrived much earlier, but I thought it would be worse. <br>  Moms and Dads generally left satisfied, you can buy a little laptop for that kind of money, besides the child will not play for hours, you will not play on it. <br>  But of course young people were upset, desires did not come true and personally I went to work in frustration ... <br><br>  ZY  Do not kick the creative talent no, just wanted to tell how it was. <br>  ZYY.Y.  Laptops still have these B510, so at lunch you can safely buy a queue for 9990 rubles <habracut></habracut></div>
