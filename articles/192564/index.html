I studied math and accounting, but I completed four more programming courses in C ++ and Java, and I liked it. <br><br>  A few years later, in 2003, I worked in a technical support service, and one of the managers asked me to start supporting an office site.  It was a static site created in Dreamweaver, and there were quite a few problems with it.  So my first task as a professional programmer was to create a new site that looked exactly like the old one, but would be written in PHP. <br><br>  It was a study of which I enjoyed. <br><br>  A few years later in 2003, I would like to be able to take care of our office‚Äôs website.  Previously it was a static site developed in Dreamweaver with <br>  quite a few issues.  It was written in PHP. <br><br>  <b>What are you working on right now?</b> <br><br>  The last five years, my main priority in the open source has been the development of the Sequel. <br><br>  5 years has been the development of the sequel. <br><br>  <b>What is the best and what is the worst in your work?</b> <br><br>  At work, I administer the network and program (without a command).  The best: I work with a wide range of projects, I completely control the process of their creation, and I have free time to work on the open source. <br><br>  The worst thing in my work is that since I am writing code alone, I don‚Äôt have the opportunity to discuss this or that idea with my colleagues.  Personal communication with other programmers occurs only at meetings or conferences. <br><br>  At work.  I get to know how to do it. <br><br>  I‚Äôm the one who is on the top of my job program.  My only in-person interactions with other programmers are during meetups <br>  and conferences. <br><br>  <b>What do you consider your main achievement in life / career at the moment?</b> <br><br>  My main professional achievement, perhaps, is that I brought the Sequel from that ‚Äúraw‚Äù state in which it was in 2008 to the current polished one. <br><br>  It is not true that it has been a state of the art. <br><br>  <b>What is the purpose of your career and professional development?</b> <br><br>  I try to master new programming tools and techniques to make the development process even easier in the future.  I hope the more time I spend on it, the easier it will be in the end and everything will be (here it is, the power of laziness). <br><br>  My goal is to make future development easier.  Hopefully I willn‚Äôt spend the rest of my life. <br><br>  <b>What helps a programmer to grow professionally</b> ? <br><br>  Practice.  You can learn how to write programs only by doing it directly.  There are two expressions that seem very relevant to me here: <br>  ‚ÄúThe right decisions come with experience.  The experience comes from the wrong decisions. ‚Äù <br>  ‚ÄúAn expert is a person who has made all conceivable mistakes in a very narrow field.‚Äù <br><br>  Practice  Time to do it.  There are two sayings that resonate with me here: <br>  ‚ÄúGood judgment comes from experience.  Experience comes from bad judgment. ‚Äù <br>  "An expert is a person who has made a very narrow field." <br><br>  <b>What book would you recommend to read to any programmer?</b> <br><br>  I do not think that I am competent enough to recommend such a book. <br><br>  I don't feel qualified to recommend such a book. <br><br>  <b>What do you like to do when you don't write code?</b> <br><br>  Spending time with your family, playing hockey, listening to music and playing video games. <br><br>  Listening to your music, playing and playing video games. <br><br>  <b>Thanks for the interview and see you in Moscow!</b> <br><br><h5>  The conference </h5><br>  We invite everyone to the RailsClub'Moscow 2013 conference. Traditionally, we will feed, give presents, hold contests and lotteries, play good music :) There will be a lot of interesting and informative. <br><br>  <a href="http://railsclub.timepad.ru/event/76008/%3Futm_refcode%3D95c73ccecc305e313977a72d1c6f02260353ae99">Registration and payment of participation in the conference</a> <br><br><h5>  Our sponsors </h5><br><h6>  The general sponsor </h6><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/8e4/bc8/536/8e4bc85362c29e29b879248da2aeb028.png"><br><br>  <a href="http://undev.ru/">Undev.ru</a> is a strong development team for Ruby, Objective C, C ++, C #, JavaScript.
