      In total, 13 teams from Obninsk, Kaluga, Dimitrovgrad and Saratov took part in the All-Russian qualifying round. <br><br>  On April 2, 2012, according to the results of the All-Russian qualifying round of the web designers competition, the winners in the Professionals group were the team from the Internet agency <a href="http://www.projex.ru/">ProjeX</a> from Obninsk, and the RUSSIAN ROULETTE team from Dimitrovgrad was recognized in the Students group. <br><br>  Our teams represented Russia in Limoges (France) on May 29-31, 2012, where 30 best teams (according to WIF) from 10 countries of the world competed in the finals of the international tournament.  Below is a list of commands, divided into groups. <br><br>  <b>Professionnals</b> <br><ul><li>  Rio - BRAZIL </li><li>  Tomato Tomato - NORWAY </li><li>  Bobbie - FRANCE </li><li>  Team Novius - FRANCE </li><li>  WOW - ARGENTINA </li><li>  Team AZEVEDO - BRAZIL </li><li>  CH Studio - FRANCE </li><li>  SQLI Agency - FRANCE </li><li>  98 Meter Wurst - GERMANY </li><li>  Simon dice - ARGENTINA </li><li>  E / X - FRANCE </li><li>  Team Pier.ws - BRAZIL </li><li>  La Cerise Numerique - BELGIUM </li><li>  ProjeX - RUSSIA </li><li>  Webkillers - POLAND </li></ul><br>  <b>Students</b> <br><ul><li>  Les Escrolleurs - FRANCE </li><li>  Plaid Interactive - NORWAY </li><li>  VOB - ARGENTINA </li><li>  Worst Team - FRANCE </li><li>  Call To Action - FRANCE </li><li>  Ecole Multimedia - FRANCE </li><li>  Bulbs - CHINA </li><li>  Dynaloo - FRANCE </li><li>  KRAV - FRANCE </li><li>  Zeecom - FRANCE </li><li>  Team Sleek - FRANCE </li><li>  NetDreams - TUNISIA </li><li>  WebFromTulle - FRANCE </li><li>  russian roulette - RUSSIA </li><li>  Batcrew - FRANCE </li></ul><br><br>  With the work on the qualifying rounds <a href="http://webdesign-festival.com/2012/2012/03/les-creations-des-equipes-wif12/">can be found here</a> on the official website wif. <br><br><h4>  Video clip about Wif Design Challenge 2012 from the official site </h4><br><iframe src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://player.vimeo.com/video/38012077&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700255,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhiFGrIl4MrmLX4SGw-AeM5upEl2Cw" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" title="WIF 2012" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <b>But more about that later, now a little about the organization of the competition ...</b> <br><br><h5>  CHARGES AND TRIPS </h5><br>  It should be noted, not everything went smoothly and flawlessly, as desired.  About the participation of some team members became known just a few days before departure, and this was due to the receipt of passports and visas.  The students didn‚Äôt have them at all, but there‚Äôs a problem with making a passport in the summer, and some have changed their last name due to getting married.  Make your passport in advance! <br><br>  According to the conditions of participation in the competition, all the accommodation and meals in the city of Limoges are assumed by the French side, and the delivery of the teams to the competition site is the Russian side (the <a href="http://www.admobninsk.ru/">administration of the city of Obninsk</a> ). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c32/d37/9b5/c32d379b52433e06571f9a2782b6403d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Our trip plan was as follows: departure from Sheremetyevo-3, a day in Paris with hotel accommodation, a train to Limoges, a competition, then all the cases are tomato cucumbers (oh, in France it is wine, cheese, fuagra), back by train to Paris and home again in Sheremetyevo-3. <br><br><h5>  PARIS - AS A GIFT </h5><br>  Thanks to the administration of Obninsk, we stayed in Paris for 1 day, and these are super impressions! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/13c/6bf/7a1/13c6bf7a1bc8f4d4a544fc2d458b664d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  They saw Notre Dame Cathedral, took pictures at the Notre-Dame de Paris temple, walked through the Tuileries Park, wandered along the Seine River, lay on the fields near the Eiffel Tower.  In general, a tick opposite to go to Paris, I set myself - it was :) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ebc/91b/eab/ebc91beabab7a45367844d19b204fd3d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h5>  A MEETING </h5><br>  From Paris to Limoges by express train.  We arrived at the station and waited, well, when will they take us away ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/583/c4c/b16/583c4cb164f3313898d27c0b9cca96c6.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  It should be noted that punctuality seems to be far from the main quality of the French, because transport, dinners, etc., happened either late or once ahead of the deadlines specified in the program.  Well, as they say - "and God be with him." <br><br><h5>  DISPERSION </h5><br>  The teams were supposed to live on the campus of the local institute, surrounded by greenery.  Personally, I have never seen such a campus in life, I assumed that their students live better than ours, but so much so!  All were provided with private rooms.  The room had a shower with toilet, necessary furniture, a refrigerator and attention!  a bed going down and going up a button, sleeping ‚Äî pressing a button, the bed went to the ceiling :) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b56/fec/786/b56fec7863421b83b912daf889ce0645.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The entrance to the building, your room and the kitchen is carried out by electronic keys.  On the campus field for the big tennis, the stadium and also God knows what, that we could not see. <br><br><h5>  FOOD ORGANIZATION </h5><br>  I can not eat croissants anymore !!!  They have them everywhere, this is no joke!  Croissants and chocola (cocoa with milk).  They have breakfast, lunch and dinner with croissants, and baguettes are very common!  We were provided with breakfast, lunch and dinner. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c86/3ec/8fd/c863ec8fdd0b1179ecbb6a02938df6c9.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Actually, I'm joking, there was plenty of everything.  In the restaurant we went only 2 times, to get acquainted with the kitchen and to eat normal roasted meat.  Wonderfully Russian people eat undercooked meat, in France there is even a proverb - ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need to kill meat a second time,‚Äù I tried, but in Russia I‚Äôm not going to risk repeating. <br><br><h5>  ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE CITY OF LIMOGES </h5><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b75/e12/90a/b75e1290ad56dd683f6b1614da0a33b5.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  It should be noted that in addition to the competition, meetings with leading experts of Web development are held, but we did not get to them.  In addition to the competition, there was plenty of time to climb the city of Limoges up and down.  Walking constantly looking around, taking pictures, walking through the narrow streets, so not typical for the Russian people and again taking pictures.  Limoges was founded under the Roman emperor Augustus in 10 BC.  (as Wikipedia says), so what to see here is. <br><br><h5>  PLACE OF CHALLENGE </h5><br>  The final stage of the Wif Design Challenge 2012 was held in the city center in the library of the local institute. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fa0/227/ebc/fa0227ebc2c2427ce3098783b26e1294.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  This is not a library (!), But a book mega-library with halls, chillout areas, elevators and conference rooms. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ca2/208/aa8/ca2208aa8cd1f80cccd11cdb78fb7543.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h5>  Oh, let's get acquainted! </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d1f/0b2/bf2/d1f0b2bf2ff224dc5e22db478d713a5d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><ul><li>  In the group ‚ÄúProfessionals‚Äù a team from the Internet agency ProjeX, Obninsk, Kaluga region (left photo). </li><li>  In the ‚ÄúStudents‚Äù group there is a team ‚ÄúRUSSIAN ROULETTE‚Äù from MEPI, Dimitrovgrad, Ulyanovsk Region (right photo). </li></ul><br>  All teams are located in the central large hall.  There are 3 teams on one table, each team has a maximum of 4 people.  Teams from Russia spread to different ends of the hall, I don‚Äôt know just that the lot fell or that the teams did not hear each other during the discussions. <br><br>  The final stage was held by the same rules as the qualifying round.  At the same time, all teams at 14 o'clock (local time) were announced the topic: <br>  <b>School and Interaction design</b> <b><br></b>  <b>Design a prototype of a product or service that imagines the future of school.</b> <br><br>  <i>... I am writing to Habr for the first time, but I will not bore you anymore ...</i> <i><br></i>  <i>continuation about WIF 2012 in the following part ...</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/145784/">https://habr.com/ru/post/145784/</a></p>
