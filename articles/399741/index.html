The most famous cryptocurrency - Bitcoin ( <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2591%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B9%25D0%25BD">ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin</a> ) appeared seven years ago and during this time the course of Bitcoin has grown two hundred and fifty million times.  I recommend reading a short, simple and understandable article about Bitcoin: <a href="http://bits.media/chto-takoe-bitcoin/">bits.media/chto-takoe-bitcoin</a> .

      Bitcoins are compared with gold - the total number of bitcoins is fixed, it is difficult to ‚Äúextract‚Äù them, and the less ‚Äúunderexposed‚Äù remains, the more difficult (now more than half are mined).  For the "mining" of bitcoin, very complex calculations are used, the mining process is called mining.  A few years ago it was possible to mine bitcoins on ordinary home computers, now it is impossible - it will take more money to power a home computer than the cost of bitcoins it can get.  Now for mining, special computers are used, united into farms, and farms are combined into pools.  Approximately once every 4 years, the amount of remuneration during mining decreases by half.  The payment for the Bitcoin block was halved on July 9, 2016.  The next reduction will occur presumably in July 2020 ( <a href="http://bitcoinclock.com/">bitcoinclock.com</a> ). <br><br>  In addition to Bitcoins, there are many other cryptocurrencies.  For example, Lightcoin is now slightly ahead of Bitcoin in terms of mining profitability, the nearest reduction in payments for the Litecoin block will occur in August 2019 ( <a href="http://litecoinblockhalf.com/">litecoinblockhalf.com</a> ). <br><br>  It is almost impossible to mine cryptocurrencies at home, but there is still a way - this is cloud mining.  The idea is that companies building data centers for mining sell "pieces" of computing power to anyone.  You buy power and start daily to receive what it is ‚Äúnamainila‚Äù minus the cost of electricity and maintenance.  In some cases, power is bought forever, so you will receive the money from the air every day until the operating costs do not exceed the income from mining.  When exactly this happens no one knows.  Now the bitcoin rate is growing and while it is growing, it will be profitable. <br><br>  So, on November 27, 2015, I bought $ 1000 of power for mining Bitcoin and Litecoin in the cloud mining service Hashflare.  At that moment, Bitcoin was one and a half times more profitable to mine, but intuition told me to distribute the power in half.  I bought 1.5 TH / s SHA-256 (mining Bitcoin) and 75 MH / s Scrypt (Lightcoin) for life. <br><br>  By the summer, the mining Lightcoin began to bring 3.5 times more income than the mining Bitcoin.  Now prices for mining Lightcoin have increased, and for mining Bitcoin have fallen dramatically, so when you buy cloud mining capacities now, the profitability from mining Litecoin and Bitcoin is almost the same. <br><br>  A year ago, Bitcoin cost $ 440, today it costs about $ 760. <br><br>  During this year, I bought additional capacity several times, but for simplicity, I calculated my income from the originally invested $ 1000. <br><br>  For the year mining brought 2.221851528 BTC.  At the current rate is $ 1688.6.  That is, the yield was 69% per annum.  Lot?  Yes.  Is it risky?  Yes.  And that is not all.  Capacities are bought for life and will bring income further. <br><br>  I brought the yield, provided that all the inked bitcoins would be displayed now at a high rate.  But I did not do it myself, and I do not advise you.  It is much more reasonable to print the money once a month and convert it into ordinary money. <br><br>  In reality, I was withdrawing money quite spontaneously, and for some I simply purchased additional capacity, but I made a calculation in case I withdraw money strictly once a month.  The table shows the income in Bitcoin by months and income in dollars when converted at the rate of the first day of the next month. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5a7/33a/ade/5a733aadec765dac26258fb5c0d4ec8a.png"></div><br><br>  In this case, the nested $ 1000 gave $ 1123.93.  The yield of 12.4%.  But this is only for a year!  A mining continues.  And although the income is declining, mining will generate income for a long time despite the fact that the money originally invested has long been repulsed.  It turns out the very "money out of thin air." <br><br>  Of course, there are many nuances.  If I just bought a year ago at $ 1000 2.27 BTC at the rate of 440, now they could be sold for $ 1,520.  But a year ago, nobody knew how much Bitcoin would be worth in a year, moreover, no one knows how much Bitcoin will cost tomorrow.  After all, this currency is not secured and the bubble may burst at any time.  However, for seven years it has been ‚Äúinflating‚Äù and how much more will be inflated hardly anyone can know. <br><br>  For the year, mining prices have changed a lot and profitability is now completely different.  It is difficult to predict the income from mining - cryptocurrency rates are constantly changing (for example, Lightcoin unexpectedly fell by 10% yesterday), the profitability of mining is also changing.  For example, I can only estimate what the income from mining would be if Bitcoin‚Äôs rate had fixed at $ 760, and the yield would always be the same as it was in November. <br><br>  Hashflare offers mining of five cryptocurrencies - Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum, Dash, Zcash.  The principal difference between the contracts of Ethereum, Dash, Zcash is that they are sold for a year and their cost includes electricity and maintenance.  Bitcoin and Litecoin contracts are sold for life, but after each accrual of income, a service and electricity fee is taken. <br>  Now mining Ethereum, Dash, Zcash does not pay off in a year, although the situation may change for the better. <br><br>  Today the Christmas sale has begun on Hashflare.  Mining Litecoin (Script) costs $ 6.60 for 1 MH / s (it was $ 9.90) and at this price and current yield it will pay off in less than 9 months.  Bitcoin mining (SHA-256) costs $ 1.00 for 10 GH / s (it was $ 1.20) and its payback period is now 12.5 months.  If the profitability remains at the level of November 2016 and the Bitcoin rate is fixed at $ 760, the mining power of Litecoin, bought for $ 1000, will bring $ 115.77 per month, and the mining power of Bitcoin, also bought at $ 1000, will bring $ 81 per month.  Of course, in fact, everything will be different.  It may be much better, and may be worse. <br><br>  Of course, now mining is not as profitable as a year ago, but in the past two months, Bitcoin's course is growing, and it may well be that the profitability will increase. <br><br>  A year ago, I risked my money and did not lose. <br><br>  If you also decide to take a risk, register on Hashflare at my link <a href="https://hashflare.io/r/9D534238">Hashflare.io</a> and I will also get something in the form of a bonus for your registration.  :) <br><br>  Important note.  It is necessary to understand that there can be no absolute guarantee of income and a refund here.  Never invest in the investment of the last money, and the more credit money. <br><br>  It is possible to pay for computing power both with an ordinary bank card, and with btc, emc transfer, as well as through webmoney and payeer payment systems.  Bitcoin cloud mining (SHA-256) can be purchased for $ 1, cloud casting for Lightcoin (Scrypt) for $ 6.60.  The injected is displayed on any bitcoin wallet, and from there money can be withdrawn to any payment system or cash using exchange services. <br><br>  ¬© 2016, Alexey Nadyozhin </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/399741/">https://habr.com/ru/post/399741/</a></p>
