It presents the main problems that, in the opinion of the participants of the Forum, hinder the further development of the Internet industry, and also proposed a number of concrete steps aimed at improving the situation and preventing possible negative consequences. <br><br>  The main provisions of the appeal: <br>  - It is necessary before the end of 2007 to compile the opinions and recommendations of the Internet community regarding the new edition of the fourth part of the Civil <br>  The Code;  to submit them for consideration to the executive and legislative authorities of the federal level;  to achieve finalization of the new edition, taking into account the wishes of the Internet community, or to delay its entry into force. <br><a name="habracut"></a>  - It is proposed, with the participation of industry organizations and leading IT specialists, to conduct a series of open and closed seminars for government employees, during which it is proposed to explain the essence of the problems of the Internet community and the reasons for its concern on the issues identified, as well as to develop clear definitions of ICT terms , the lack of which makes communication between ICT workers and government officials difficult. <br>  - In connection with objective necessity, it is proposed to evaluate the feasibility of reducing or canceling VAT on Internet advertising, Internet sales of goods and services in the Russian Federation until 2015.  This step will allow creating a favorable environment for the inflow of investments and speeding up the development of the Russian Internet, as well as radically increasing the competitiveness of Russian IT companies on the world market. <br>  - International experience in the development of the labor market in the IT field shows the economic feasibility of using the principle of remote work (the so-called ‚Äútele-working‚Äù).  In this connection, it is necessary to study and substantiate the possibility of developing the practice of remote work in Russian companies, including  by introducing tax incentives for organizations introducing this way of working for employees. <br>  - There is a need for serious strengthening and processing of existing approaches to training and retraining of personnel in the field of information technologies.  It is proposed to develop recommendations for the refinement of existing government programs in this area, taking into account the successful experience of leading companies in the industry and the involvement of leading IT specialists. <br>  - It is proposed to involve the Internet community in assessing the effectiveness and feasibility of developing any new laws and regulations that are under development in ministries and departments related to the implementation of certain rules governing and regulating the relationship between providers and data transfer operators;  the work of online media;  telematic service operators;  requirements for the Russian Internet user. <br>  ‚ÄúSuch participation is possible through the initiation of the creation of relevant public expert councils and working groups at relevant ministries of departments, as well as through the organization of public hearings on all new legislative initiatives. <br>  - For the successful implementation of socially significant projects on the Internet, not focused on profit, it is necessary to justify the need for greater government involvement in their support and development.  First of all, we are talking about such areas in which the advantages of the Internet as an information and communication environment make it possible to get the maximum social return: support for the Russian language and Russian culture in communities of compatriots abroad;  social adaptation of people with disabilities and providing them with work in the network;  educational and cultural projects;  projects aimed at overcoming information and digital inequality (portals and services for regional users).

      The participants of RIF-2007 expressed the hope that the recommendations and proposals expressed by them in the appeal will be accepted by Russian public and non-profit organizations as a guide for action in their future work with government bodies, relevant ministries and departments. <br><br>  In the future, Forum participants are also looking forward to closer cooperation with government bodies, to attract the Internet community to participate in the development of initiatives, recommendations, bills and regulations that directly or directly regulate and stimulate the development of the Russian segment of the international Internet. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.miks.ru/news/news.php%3Fpid%3D9027">www.miks.ru/news/news.php?pid=9027</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/7306/">https://habr.com/ru/post/7306/</a></p>
