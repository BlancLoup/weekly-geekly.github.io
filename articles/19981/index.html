  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Regarding IT Education</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  On Habr passed several topics one way or another connected with IT-education.  I want to share my thoughts and experiences. <br><br><h2>  Foreword </h2><br>  I am 18 years old, I am a student of one of the largest universities in the Urals.  I study on an exclusively humanitarian specialty, it was not possible to enter for something technical because of bad knowledge of mathematics. <br>  It so happened that since childhood I was fascinated by computers.  Of course, I did not find the perfect geeky time of the spectra, my first car was the second Pentium.  Unfortunately, my relationship with mathematics did not develop in elementary school.  For this you need to thank one extremely unprofessional teacher, who repulsed my interest in this subject.  In addition, I have never been an excellent student, I always studied at 3-4.  We had computer science at school, but I didn‚Äôt get really useful and new knowledge there.  Yes, we ‚Äústudied‚Äù pascal and html, but only a couple of classes were devoted to them and already at that time I could give a head start to my teacher.  At school, I had no idea who I would work in the future. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h2>  Young fighter </h2><br>  My children's curiosity and the presence of a modem did their job.  Like any teenager, I very hard plowed the Internet in search of any nishtyakov.  I wanted to know how this whole system works.  So I learned about web servers, dns, protocols (http and TCP / IP transport).  Those.  made a basic presentation.  My curiosity, at this stage, was satisfied.  Further, for some reason I was interested in the device of sites.  Acquainted with html (oh, then the whole runet was ‚Äútabular‚Äù and no one even thought about web standards, block layout) and js I got into programming.  My first language was PHP =).  Apparently this is a consequence of its popularity and low threshold of entry.  Now I certainly understand that php is not the best option, but it happened and nothing can be changed.  At that time, my knowledge of programming, as in the discipline, was minimal.  Quickly realizing that nobody will chew anything on phpclub and ru_php, I downloaded the manual to php and begged money from my parents and bought books (Koterov, the ‚Äúphp programmer's handbook‚Äù).  Having studied php and a little MySQL with their help, I decided to try my hand.  Having found a free hosting with the capabilities I needed, I made my homepage.  There was a terrible design, poor tabular layout and nasty, holey scripts.  But I was extremely proud of myself =) Then my idea came to my young head to create a game portal.  I met with various CMS of average scall.  It was decided to sculpt your product.  A simple system was written quite quickly, the design was stolen - the portal was working.  He even had a regular audience and attendance in the region of 50-60 uniwi per day.  Supporting and developing this project, I acquired new skills: valid layout and standards, initial knowledge in the PLO.  Then there is no point in telling.  Much time has passed since then, many different projects were born and died.  Now I‚Äôm quite a successful freelancer, there are good, good projects behind my back.  I own a python and pkhp, I study cut;  I can raise the lamp and successfully administer this bundle.  I earn not very much, but I have enough for various youth joys and for partial payment for the institute.  I want to completely devote myself to IT.

    <h2>  findings </h2><br>  I think it is clear that I am a pure self-taught.  I do not want all my life to be an IT-artisan, I need to develop.  My problem is that I rested against my ceiling.  I lack serious theoretical training, and I was forced to admit that I could not afford it without help.  This knowledge can only be given by the institute.  Perhaps I have no right to give any advice, but I will still give one.  If a young man wants to work in the field of IT, then he can go the same way as I do.  But in the end he will have a somewhat superficial baggage of knowledge and will become an artisan.  There is nothing bad in it, such personnel are in demand, it is possible to earn quite normal money on this.  But for something more technical education is needed.  Yes, educational programs are outdated.  Yes, the educational system, to put it mildly, does not keep abreast of events.  But it seems to me that there are basic things that are always up to date.  Going to the university, you get a lot of rubbish, husk, but at the same time and useful knowledge that is very difficult to obtain in the "home" conditions.  If you have a desire to receive new knowledge, then you will be able to extract useful information from the university course.  In addition, the university is a new acquaintance, new people.  Who knows, maybe you will find like-minded people among teachers and students.  What to do, everyone decides for himself, but if you want to learn and be a true professional in your field, then you cannot do without a higher technical education.  Naturally, there are exceptions to every rule, in this case they are exceptionally talented and assiduous people, but this only confirms the rule. <br><br>  PS Sorry for some naivety and confusion, this is my first experience in writing such materials =) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/19981/">https://habr.com/ru/post/19981/</a></p>
