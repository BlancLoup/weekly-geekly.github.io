At work, he often encounters all sorts of technical innovations and it cannot be said that he regrets this at all.  He did not have an <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/drjohnes/" class="user_link">account</a> on Habr√© before this post (thanks, <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/drjohnes/" class="user_link">drjohnes</a> !).  Go: <br><br>  Against the background of the growing popularity of various kinds of gadgets and devices for geeks, the world famous brand decided to launch a very specific product on the market - watch phones (although it is worth noting that the device is not unique).  The device received a fairly high price, but the build quality and reasonableness of management, in contrast to the much cheaper Chinese counterparts, partially justify the money that will have to pay for it.  Analogs from famous brands simply do not exist.  And I will try to paint the pros and cons of the miracle machine. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e99/9b2/ec8/e999b2ec89c235a32df9a5c4a4cdd57a.jpg" alt="image">

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Standard equipment includes the watch itself, a bluetooth headset, a charger that allows you to simultaneously charge both, and, respectively, a software CD and a book.  For a headset, there are 3 pairs of interchangeable ear hooks of different sizes.  Leather strap with a secure buckle and conveniently adjustable length. <br>  The charger is cradle, because  There are no direct connectors on the watch itself.  In any case, no one will charge the watch without removing it from the hand, therefore it is rather a convenience.  Full charge takes a little less than 2 hours.  After that, the clock confidently works 1-2 days depending on the intensity of use. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e95/697/7d0/e956977d0fd530780f9211c854a982f4.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The headset is configured once, then instantly picked up when an incoming or outgoing call.  The only thing that could have been done differently is to slightly bend the ‚Äúleg‚Äù of the microphone.  Strong enough to stick to the side.  Or you can talk through the speakerphone.  I must note, you can simultaneously talk and listen to the interlocutor.  No echo or noises were noticed.  The headset has a sufficiently high-quality microphone system - extraneous noises are well muffled, including wind noise. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/792/dda/722/792dda72278b9df145b200af924b1ac8.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Now, in fact, I‚Äôll go on to the description of the watch phone itself.  As I mentioned above, the build quality and ease of use are excellent.  The touch screen with flipped pages allows you to quickly get to any function. <br>  The first and main screen is the clock.  You can choose from several designs.  It is possible to display the time in two time zones.  Not to say that LG worked hard on elegance or originality.  Hopefully, firmware updates will appear periodically with new design options. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6ac/a17/19e/6aca1719eef6e4ee9ca61afd23fa52a9.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Behind him comes the call screen: voice and video call, for which the GD910 is equipped with a VGA camera at the end and support for 3G networks.  For obvious reasons, I cannot say anything about the quality of video calls.  On the same camera you can take photos with a resolution of 640x480 pixels.  True, it‚Äôs more likely to be pictures of yourself because turning the hand and aiming the ‚Äúlens‚Äù at something without looking into the viewfinder is extremely difficult.  I would say almost unreal.  I have already written about the quality of voice communication, so I will not repeat it.  All perfectly. <br>  The second screen - settings "Contacts", "Messages", "Utilities", "Settings". <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c6c/65d/c82/c6c65dc8275dd04b38de93f4051483bc.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Contacts allocated 1000 memory cells.  You can set groups, speed dials.  The following fields are available for each contact: name, phone numbers, e-mail, birthday, anniversary, home address, company address, web address, melody, image and group. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/cf1/939/945/cf19399458fb1292b7904aaa681f51d8.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The utilities have: organizer, alarm clock, voice recorder, calculator, unit converter, world time viewer, timer, media player and camera.  By the way, the calculator is almost ‚Äúengineering‚Äù, with support for trigonometric functions. <br>  In the settings, you select the basic parameters of the phone: date, time, call signals, preference for network selection, etc.  And you can also ‚Äúslightly‚Äù customize the interface - change the font size and design of some screens.  By default, the settings screen is presented in the form of 4 icons, but you can change the location to a rolling wheel.  Personally, I liked it more, although access was a bit more complicated - instead of just clicking on the icon, you need to scroll to select the one you need. <br><br>  The fourth screen is a calendar, notes and media player, switchable via vertical scrolling.  You can add events, holidays.  There is nothing new and revolutionary.  Everything is quite typical, but convenient for such a device. <br>  Ease of use for such a device at altitude. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/11f/108/c1f/11f108c1f5181261e29a58947c7a0a08.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  SMS text is typed using the on-screen keyboard 0-9, *, #.  You can enable T9.  The set is usual for phones with standard keys.  Three side hardware keys switch to "Call screen" / "Answer", "Previous screen", "Clock" / "Hang up". <br><br>  What is the result?  Very high quality product with a thoughtful interface.  There are no full analogues.  The closest Samsung chasofon does not have video call support.  However, it has its advantages.  The price category brings such watches to the level of good Swiss mechanics (in stores from 26,500 to 29,500 rubles apiece).  Such a device can be considered as a "watch-phone for sports", or as a gadget for geeks.  Not everyone can afford them. <br><br>  <a href="http://picasaweb.google.ru/AlexeyReshetnyak1985/vGpxxG%3Ffeat%3Ddirectlink">All photos</a> <br><br>  On youtube there is an amusing Russian-language <a href="http://bit.ly/89goUV">video review</a> , but I warn you, there is a link to the online store. <br><br>  Written by: <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/esploratore/" class="user_link">esploratore</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/88446/">https://habr.com/ru/post/88446/</a></p>
