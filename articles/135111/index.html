    <h3>  What is Skitch? </h3><br>  Skitch is a handy tool that allows you to bring your ideas and thoughts to others, without resorting to many words.  With Skitch, you can leave notes and draw on almost any object that you come across, whether it is a new or existing photo, a web page, a screen shot, a map or a blank sheet.  Then you can share your notes with friends or colleagues and save everything in Evernote.  As you can see, it is extremely simple. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bcf/97f/9a5/bcf97f9a543d60d2112efe12e10bd79c.jpg"><br><br><h3>  Skitch for iPad </h3><br>  Skitch iPad‚Äôs main features are available on the app‚Äôs home screen. <br><br>  <b>Photos and Camera:</b> You can choose whether to work with an existing image from your collection on the tablet or to take a new picture.  Use the camera on the iPad to take photos of things that you thought were remarkable, or simply take a picture of a friend who wanted to paint on the antennae.  If your iPad does not have a camera, this option will not show. <br><br>  <b>Screenshot:</b> Skitch for iPad is smart enough to detect recently taken screenshots.  Take a screenshot on your iPad (to do this, just simultaneously press the home button and the power button).  After the flash, the picture will be added to your photos.  Open Skitch, click on the Screenshot button, make the necessary notes and send the result to colleagues or friends.  This is a great solution for many situations, whether it is a demonstration of the design of a mobile application or its new record in Angry Birds. <br><br>  <b>Web:</b> Skitch for iPad has got its own web browser that allows you to make notes over web pages.  By clicking on the Web icon, you can either enter the address immediately or begin entering a search query.  When you find the page you are looking for, click on the Snap icon.  Now you have an image of a webpage for making notes.  You can use this mode to enter your comments about a web project or point someone at the online store you want to buy. <br><br>  <b>Map:</b> Have you ever tried to explain to someone exactly where the meeting will take place, which building is your house, or where is the best place to park?  Then the Map option is what you need.  Find and enlarge the correct map forg, and then use the Skitch tools to draw a label or draw a route.  You will be surprised how often it is difficult to accurately describe the right place without additional help.  With Skitch, you end up wandering in unfamiliar terrain. <br><br>  <b>Blank:</b> Sometimes you just need to start from scratch.  Open a blank sheet and sketch your ideas.  Use shapes, arrows, drawing tools, and colors to unleash your inspiration. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d95/407/73b/d9540773b31d5a7ae28ecf0f1b7e11e3.png"><br><br><h3>  Drawing tools </h3><br>  Skitch contains a number of very handy drawing tools for touch control. <br><ul><li>  <b>Finger:</b> use it to grab and move any object you have drawn and want to move.  You can also rotate an object or resize it with a simple zoom gesture. </li><li>  <b>Pencil:</b> Pencil is designed to create sketches quickly and freely. </li><li>  <b>Arrows:</b> With Skitch's proprietary arrows, you can point out the important things shown in the picture. </li><li>  <b>Text:</b> select this item, then click on the place where you want to place the text.  Enter it in the text field and click on <i>Done</i> . </li><li>  <b>Shapes:</b> Circles, squares and lines are available.  Swipe your finger over the image to draw the desired shape. </li><li>  <b>Crop:</b> With this feature you can trim your sheet to any desired size. </li></ul><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d95/407/73b/d9540773b31d5a7ae28ecf0f1b7e11e3.png"><br><br><h3>  Save everything in Evernote </h3><br>  All your drawings and notes are saved to Skitch for iPad, but if you want them to be available to you everywhere, you can also save them to Evernote.  To save the image, click on the icon with an elephant. <br><br><h3>  Share on Twitter, by mail and via AirPlay </h3><br>  Skitch for iPad provides you with several ways to share your sketches.  You can email them to your friends or post them on Twitter.  It also supports AirPlay, a technology that allows you to display the contents of an iPad display on any screen with Apple TV. <br><br><h3>  iPad is just the beginning </h3><br>  We developed the Skitch iOS app first for the iPad, since the tablet is the perfect form factor for drawing.  But don't worry, Skitch for iPhone is already in the works.  In the meantime, we invite you to try out the iPad version at work, in games, during training and for creative leisure.  The application will be useful when you are planning an event or doing repairs.  Use it to communicate with someone who speaks another language.  Start working with Skitch, and you will understand how many wonderful opportunities open up a few simple lines and arrows.  Hope you enjoy. <br><br>  <b><a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/skitch-for-ipad/id490505997%3Fmt%3D8">Download Skitch for iPad on the App Store</a></b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/135111/">https://habr.com/ru/post/135111/</a></p>
