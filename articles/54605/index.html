      Software Quality Assurance Days is not just another opportunity for companies to present themselves to the general public and draw attention to their services.  This is a place where acute and actual problems are discussed and new and promising solutions are proposed that take into account the interests of all parties: both customers and software service provider companies. <br><br>  The conference program committee carefully selects the topics for presentations.  Priority is given to reports that contain practical experience in solving problems, as well as to reports of an innovative nature (new technologies that make it easier to work). <br><br>  The high activity of the participants of the four previous conferences clearly showed how great interest is in testing and software quality assurance. <br><br>  The fourth SQA Days conference, which was held on November 17, 2008 in Minsk (the first three conferences were held in Moscow), gathered not only a record number of participants (more than 350 people from different regions), but also became a unique platform for exchanging experience and creating conditions for cooperation for the implementation of joint projects in the field of testing.  Each specialist received the opportunity to exchange contacts and information with their colleagues from other countries. <br><br>  According to the established tradition, the fifth international conference SQA Days is organized by the company SQALab (Moscow) on the basis of the <a href="http://xn--itconf-cg0c.ru/">IT-CONF.RU</a> portal (a resource that brings together high-quality conferences for IT specialists in the CIS, as well as <a href="http://xn--itconf-cg0c.ru/">neighboring</a> countries) together in the <a href="http://software-testing.ru/">Software</a> portal <a href="http://software-testing.ru/">-Testing.Ru</a> . <br><br>  SQA Days-2009 will be devoted to issues related to software testing and quality assurance: functional testing, integration testing, performance testing, test automation and tools, configuration testing, usability and security testing, static quality assurance methods, and also issues of implementation of testing processes in the enterprise, management of software quality assurance processes, coma management issues  Dr. testers and quality assurance engineers, and other areas of interest QA-specialists. <br><br>  Additionally, it is planned to consider the issues of testing system applications (not Web), as well as testing games and mobile applications. <br><br>  It is also planned to raise the topics of motivation of the project team and certification of specialists in the field of software quality assurance. <br><br>  The proposed format of the event is a two-day conference, within which parallel sections on various technologies will be held.  Forms of speeches - reports with a multimedia presentation, reports on flip charts, round tables, master classes, focus groups.  Thus, the essence of the new trends this year lies in the ‚Äúinformality‚Äù of the conference atmosphere, namely: comfortable conditions for communication, equality of participants, the absence of barriers to exchange of views, the solution of topical issues and a promising partnership in implementing projects following the conference. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe conference program, as well as the range of issues discussed, is expanding from year to year.  Conducting and organizing the fifth conference of the SQA Days series, we set ourselves two tasks at once.  One of them is to give people the opportunity to freely communicate with each other, because the conference is an important platform for ‚Äúlive‚Äù professional communication.  On the other hand, I want to show that the raging financial crisis is not only sudden problems, but also unexpected perspectives.  After all, the issue of software quality and business process optimization is particularly relevant now, when each company is actively fighting for the opportunity to stay ‚Äúafloat‚Äù.  We hope that SQA Days-2009 in St. Petersburg will become an absolutely unique forum that accumulates accumulated experience in software testing and combines several formats at once.  Perhaps today I will not disclose all the secrets of the conference, follow our announcements on the site, ‚Äùcommented Vladislav Orlikov, Chairman of the Organizing Committee of SQA Days-2008, General Director of SQALab, Moscow, Russia. <br><br>  You can get more information about SQA Days-2009 and apply for participation for listeners, speakers and potential partners on the official website of the conference <a href="http://www.it-conf.ru/">http://www.it-conf.ru/</a> or on the conference organizing committee <a href="">org@it-conf.ru</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/54605/">https://habr.com/ru/post/54605/</a></p>
