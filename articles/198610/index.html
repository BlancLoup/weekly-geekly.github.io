Now I want to talk about one of the cases that happened then.  In <a href="http://www.defacto2.net/file/detail/a315c">issue</a> 2 of the The Naked Truth magazine, we can read a list called ‚ÄúBBS Cemetery‚Äù - a list of BBS-ca, which in different years closed themselves or were closed by the police.  In this list, including the Arizona site The Final Frontier under the management of a certain Mikeysoft and The Pits, which was managed by Pieman. <br><br>  When on October 17, 1995 (if I'm not mistaken in the calculations), the The Final Frontier modem lines suddenly stopped responding, and everyone was worried about what had happened.  There were various rumors.  A few days later, Mikey himself appeared on the network, but he denied everything, discouraging various stories.  Another famous participant of the scene, w00per, stated that Mikey was arrested, and that the addresses, phone numbers and other data of practically everyone who had a deal with him were already in the hands of the authorities, since he was very careless and kept all of this in unencrypted form.  Pieman was arrested the following week in New York.  He himself reported this scene immediately, although this threatened him with an increase in punishment.

      Then everyone understood that Mikeysoft was also arrested, and several people who knew him had spoken about it, but the most interesting was the conversation with Oil Patch on November 4, which was published in the 5th issue of Inquisition magazine.  Full translation of this conversation - under the cut. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><hr> <br>  I today very persistently stated to Mikey that there is already ENOUGH to lie.  And if he continues, I will show the logs of phone calls.  Because with his lie, he is still trying to get away from the water.  Here is how it was‚Ä¶ <br><br>  First, do you remember when they told us that Mikey was in a coma? <br><br>  <b>Yes..</b> <br><br>  It was on Thursday after he was arrested on Tuesday!  And if you remember, he also said that he was robbed, right? <br><br>  <b>Yes, but it was before.</b> <br><br>  So, no one did not rob.  He was arrested on Tuesday morning.  That Tuesday, when he said he was robbed!  And then there was this.  I usually talk to him on the phone somewhere in a day ... and so it was for many years.  I started calling him that Tuesday evening, the day of the arrest.  All his modems and phones were busy.  But before this has never happened, he included call waiting.  I tried to 2 nights and all the time was busy.  I tried Wednesday morning, still busy.  On Thursday afternoon, the voice line was released, but the modems did not respond. <br><br>  I left him a message on Wednesday, more precisely two or three.  On Thursday, his lawyer replied.  At least he said he was a lawyer.  He said that Mikey is in a coma.  But Mikey was NOT in a coma, he was not in the hospital, although he took a rather large dose of sleeping pills. <br><br>  <b>OK</b>  <b>And why did his lawyer lie?</b> <br><br>  He simply conveyed the message as requested by Mikey, because Mikey knew that I would be worried about what had happened, and he did not want to say that he was arrested.  By the way, the lawyer in question is a certain Chester.  Not his usual Clint Smith, but from the same firm. <br><br>  That Thursday, when we received a message in IRC, I started calling the hospitals.  I called every hospital in Phoenix, Mesa, Chandler, etc.  Mikey was not in the hospital.  I called everyone in Phoenix who knew Mikey, and no one heard anything, or saw him. <br><br>  On Friday morning, I called his lawyer, Clint Smith.  I said: ‚ÄúWe were told that Mikey is in a coma.  I called all the hospitals and Mikey is not in any of them.  What's happening?" <br><br>  He replied: ‚ÄúYes, Mikey is not in the hospital.  He is at home, but he has other problems now. ‚Äù <br><br>  And then I realized that he was arrested.  The lawyer said: "Call him tonight, I'm sure he will pick up the phone."  By that time, I spoke to another person from Phoenix who SAW Mikey and was at his house. <br><br>  <b>w00per?</b> <br><br>  No, it was a different person.  He said Mikey was arrested.  He was there, and in the house there was not a single computer, not a single floppy disk, nothing.  He said that no one would steal every tape, every cable, every floppy disk, and left all the expensive audio / video equipment and televisions. <br><br>  Then Mikey realized that we would find out everything, and came up with this story with a robbery.  On Friday evening, I called him and he repeated the same thing to me about whom, robbery, etc. <br><br>  <b>Why didn't Mikey want us to find out that he was arrested?</b> <br><br>  Ask him yourself, but this is NOT ALL.  Believe me, I won't tell you everything, but I'm not going to lie anymore.  In short, on Friday, Mikey got its monitor back.  He received it not because the police allegedly FOUND him, but because of the law on confiscation.  By law, they cannot detain equipment that cannot contain evidence.  In general, when I found out that the monitor was returned, I had no doubt that he was arrested. <br><br>  On Saturday, I asked him directly: "Mikey, tell the truth, were you arrested?"  He replied: "This is absurd." I said: "Mikey, this is crap, you were NOT in the hospital, I called them all and you were not there."  He said: "Well, this is because they were told not to disclose the information." <br><br>  In general, I was sure that some comrades should be warned so that he could not go to their sites.  Specifically, I told the three that I KNOW that Mikey was arrested, although I have no evidence. <br><br>  We changed the IP of our site, and when on Friday evening Mikey asked me for a new address, I said that I did not know him.  He recognized him from someone else, and in the log you can see that he stopped by at midnight and stayed there for 2 hours.  Another person I warned also asked Mikey if they arrested him or not.  It was on Saturday, and Mikey said this is absurd!  Be that as it may, Mikey got an IP address from someone else who did not know about the arrest. <br><br>  <b>Maybe it was not Mikey?</b>  <b>IP spoofer / slirp?</b> <br><br>  Not.  In fact, Mikey himself admitted.  He even said exactly who gave him the address.  I said it was MAD.  He replied: "Well, Novell will not check it anyway." I said: "Mikey, not a damn thing for yourself, you yourself told me that they were watching you all the time" <br><br>  In short, somewhere on Saturday or Sunday, the Mikey account was removed from the site.  The following Tuesday, he called my office.  He said, ‚ÄúNola, Clint called me now, he accidentally heard <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hacker_Crackdown">Gail Thackery</a> and Novell's conversation at the police station, they are going to take BBS in New York.‚Äù He said that I MUST contact Pierre because he doesn't have his number.  I was at work, and I never knew the name Pierre.  Therefore, I could not call him. <br><br>  <b>Toyman warned.</b> <br><br>  Toyman'a warned me.  He was one of those three people I told.  I told him that Mikey was arrested, Toyman called him and also directly asked about the arrest, and Mikey replied that this was not true.  But it's true that Mikey went to IRC on Tuesday and told everyone that Novell was planning a raid on BBS in New York. <br><br>  <b>So he, in general, saved toyman.</b> <br><br>  Yes nifiga.  He denied his arrest, he only told him about New York. <br><br>  <b>But he warned Toyman that they could take him too.</b> <br><br>  Mikey DIDN'T SAY to Toyman that they were going to take him too, until very Thursday, when they took Pieman.  Hack it on the nose.  If you want, do not believe me anyway. <br><br>  Mikey and I have been close friends for 4 or 5 years.  He lied to me and continued to lie.  He is still trying to wriggle out, as if to make his lie look believable.  He says: "Well ... probably I just lost my sense of time." <br><br>  I have no reason to vilify Mikey.  But I have reasons to protect people who are also my friends.  I tried to warn them almost a week before Mikey admitted that he was taken.  And all this time Mikey went to the site. <br><br>  I remember it seemed to be on Sunday, that week when he was arrested.  Someone went to NTA-nokturnal and said that Mikey was arrested.  All these youngsters ‚Äî his fans screamed ‚Äî how could YOU DARE to say that.  Hell, he didn't even say anything then.  Still trying to warn only those who REALLY had to know. <br><br>  And if SOMEONE can deny ANYTHING WORD from this, I promise to kiss their smelly asses.  And believe me, I never kissed my ass and am not going to begin! <br><br>  <b>Well, I can refute that he went to the site.</b>  <b>However, after your words, I do not know whether it is worth it.</b> <br><br>  Damn, Devast, when I talked to him on the phone, he said he stopped by.  If you want to believe him - so he himself admitted. <br><br>  <b>As I said, I now do not know myself.</b> <br><br>  Come show your evidence.  If they are from Mikey and you believe it, to be honest, to hell with me.  Truth is true, the rest does not interest me.  Mikey said: ‚ÄúAfter all, it‚Äôs not important WHEN they took me, but what I warned Pie.‚Äù I said to him: ‚ÄúShit, you lied and lied and lied.  No one will ever believe you! ‚ÄùWhat do you say to that? <br><br>  <b>Nothing.</b>  <b>We all lie, but it certainly was too much.</b> <br><br>  What was too much?  I tried to protect the right people.  Heck!  Devast, they told you.  Not for me.  They TRIED to tell you, and you did not want to believe.  Sorry, this is not important.  Hide in the sand if you like it that way.  It's your problem. <br><br>  <b>I want to know the truth.</b> <br><br>  Devast, even NOW I do not tell you everything I know.  Because I promised Mikey that I would not say, and I would not.  I don't think you believe me.  Do you want to believe him, come on, believe.  Do what you like.  We never spoke to you, and I certainly have no reason to lie about a friend whom I have known for 4 years.  With whom we spoke every day.  A friend I know better than any of you.  But when this friend puts ALL of my other friends in danger with their lies and actions, I had to tell the truth. <br><br>  <b>Do you think Mikey helped / help novel / microsoft?</b> <br><br>  I said only what was absolutely necessary to protect my friends.  I will say no more about this incident. <br><br>  <b>It is very important whether it helps novel / microsoft.</b>  <b>If so, then ALL should know.</b> <br><br>  I can only say: if he lied so much, what difference does it make now? <br><br>  <b>I need to know how far he has come.</b>  <b>I need to know the truth.</b> <br><br>  Decide youself.  Since he constantly lied, what's the difference what he did?  Today, Mikey called me and asked me to confirm his story, that he called me on duty and so on.  I agreed, but I said that I would not lie about the rest.  Given this, it is clear that his phone is not tapped. <br><br><hr><br>  So ends the conversation, from which it is obvious, and this was confirmed by subsequent statements by Mikey, that he, on the advice of a lawyer, hid his arrest to the last, as the police demanded.  What happened at this time with Mikey, who came through his account on the sites, we most likely will never know.  18 years have passed, and now this is already a story, one of many.  There is a lot of BBS on the list above, and the short word ‚Äúbust‚Äù is next to every third one. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/198610/">https://habr.com/ru/post/198610/</a></p>
