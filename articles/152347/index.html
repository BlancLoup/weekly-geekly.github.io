      <b>This is what the author of the book, David Shervin, writes in his introduction:</b> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Have you been in a situation when you need to finish work on a project, and there is no time left?  Did you feel annoyed that time pressure does not allow your creative abilities to open up fully?  Then this book is for you.  Here you will find eighty tasks with hints that will help you see new approaches to quickly solving a variety of design problems. <br><br>  Take the chance to hone your skills and you can cope with any design project - from creating a brand and related promotional products to a full-scale interactive user-centric project.  Along the way, you will also master the design of navigation systems, the design of newspapers, magazines and websites, as well as work with video and animation. <br><br>  So that you can successfully cope with these tasks, I propose to use brainstorming techniques.  By applying them in practice, you will find new and more effective ways to solve complex design problems and use them in your work. <br><br>  Designers who dream of making a career often have to do things they have no idea about.  I had the same thing.  The first years in this field, I felt clearly uncomfortable.  Here's what my usual working day looked like: Make two new logos for a new wine bar by tomorrow?  You are welcome!  Prepare a cover for advertising a cruise in South America?  Will be done!  By Friday to build a home and a secondary page for a website for innovative consulting?  No problem!  Everything will be done, and then at two in the morning I will collapse <br>  on the keyboard.  Over the years of digging trenches, I discovered the following: <br><br>  <b><i>Failure is a necessary component of creativity.</i></b> <br><br>  Experienced designers know that the ability to resist a series of failures is the only way to success.  If you want to learn how to work better, then you need to be ready every day to explore uncharted territory.  David Kelly of IDEO calls this ‚Äúenlightenment by <br>  trial and error ‚Äù, and this is the best way to get the result that will satisfy your customers completely. <br><br>  <b><i>There is always not enough time for a project</i></b> <br><br>  Sometimes the tight deadlines for order fulfillment may lead to more interesting results if you manage them wisely.  We cry that we do not have enough time to solve the problem, but we just need to get down to business.  Deadline still comes unexpectedly, regardless of whether you are working alone at home on the order of any company or as part of a reputable design company.  Customers always demand something beyond you. <br>  the limits of your skills.  The work of the designer is more like a marathon, rather than a series of sprint races, so the only way to keep a sane mind is to move at a constant productive speed and at the same time not interfering with creativity. <br><br><h5>  Topics covered in the book </h5><br>  Try these eighty assignments, and you will take a trip through almost all the major <br>  areas of modern design.  They are divided into the following categories: <br><br>  <b>Fundamental skills:</b> <br><ul><li>  creating advertising text; </li><li>  design history; </li><li>  modular layout system; </li><li>  illustration; </li><li>  paper construction; </li><li>  the photo; </li><li>  physical layout; </li><li>  research; </li><li>  typography. </li></ul><br>  <b>Work disciplines:</b> <br><ul><li>  <b>Advertising and marketing:</b> guerrilla marketing;  online advertising;  outdoor advertising;  printable advertisement;  advertising posters;  TV ads. </li><li>  <b>Branding:</b> annual reports;  advertising brochures;  identity development;  creating a proprietary product packaging. </li><li>  <b>Newspapers, magazines, websites, film production:</b> book covers;  magazine layouts;  packaging music products;  movie billboards. </li><li>  <b>Interactive environment:</b> information architecture;  interactive storyboard;  user interface design </li><li>  <b>Product development</b> </li><li>  <b>Design of retail space, signs and signs:</b> ecological graphic design;  retail;  exhibition stands;  signs and signs. </li><li>  <b>Font design</b> </li><li>  <b>Video and animation graphics:</b> drawn animation;  storyboard </li></ul><br><br>  <b>Here is an example of one of the tasks.</b>  <b>Task number 41:</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/50b/de3/dd5/50bde3dd5cc0966e9abf7b6050451fa3.jpg" alt="Task 41"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3bc/8d9/452/3bc8d94527cd817c17a8e7f6108169a2.jpg" alt="Task 41-2"><br><br><ul><li>  <a href="http://www.piter.com/book.phtml%3F978545901648">Book on piter.com</a> <i>(electronic version is available!)</i> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.ozon.ru/context/detail/id/18483429/">Book on www.ozon.ru</a> </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/152347/">https://habr.com/ru/post/152347/</a></p>
