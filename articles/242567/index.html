      When I chose a topic for my speech, the first thing that occurred to me was ... <br><br>  Sales!  I'm sure I am not surprised by my choice now.  But the topic of sales, I chose not in vain.  There is one thing that is sometimes the hardest to sell.  This is an idea. <br><br>  Every day we convince a variety of people in their point of view.  I want to make it so that I click the toggle switch, and the person immediately becomes agree with you.  But for some reason this is not always the case. <br><br>  It was even written a couple of words about why this is happening and what to do with it ... </blockquote><br><br>  <b>"How to sell an idea"</b> <br><br>  If you want someone to do what you come up with, then you want to sell the idea.  There are several options.  For example, pay extra.  It‚Äôs still easy to sell ideas that have no alternative.  And much less often we manage to really captivate a person. <br><br>  It would be good if our employees were passionate about the task, and our management would be burning with the idea that we came up with.  Here our relatives would accept our variant of rest, shopping or repair.  And no bargaining, they say the last time we did it in your opinion, but this time ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Why do we face resistance?</b> <br><br>  Resistance is a natural state of the body.  Moreover, we feel bad if there is nothing to resist.  For example, logically, we should be more comfortable at an ambient temperature of 36 degrees, but in fact comfortable at 28. Conventionally, this difference shows our need for resistance.  The same in a relationship. <br><br>  At the same time, resistance is a phase.  Sometimes hunt and warm up.  Ideally, this cycle was described by Bruce Tuckman.  We shot a <a href="http://intelligent-sales.ru/">watch seminar</a> about it. <br><br>  There are also subjective factors.  The main, in our case, is related to needs.  The mechanism is as follows: our desires are not directly related to needs.  They are related to ways of meeting needs.  In other words, we do not care how to eat, sleep, make money.  To such an extent, it is all the same that we are sometimes ready to refuse to meet the need.  Neuroscientists even claim that there are separate groups of neurons in the brain that are responsible for avoiding errors, a kind of worm of doubt.  Anyway, we want it to be ‚Äúin the mind‚Äù, ‚Äúas in people‚Äù, etc.  But the ideas about how it should be different for everyone, so the ways to meet the needs are also different. <br><br><blockquote>  I remember the story associated with the first foreign cars in our country.  The owner of such a car left it in a paid parking lot, putting it in first gear, and the guards decided to roll the car and, as a result, turned down the valves. <br><br>  The story developed as follows: the owner demanded to bring the original valves from Japan;  one guard decided to order them at the factory, but pass them off as Japanese;  another believed that no Japanese could make a valve better than his uncle - a tokor in a defense enterprise. <br><br>  And when the first guard was proving to the owner Japanese origin of the unclean valves, the second one could not stand it and was stunned by the debaters: ‚ÄúYes, they make rockets at this factory!‚Äù <br><br>  Curtain applause! <br><br>  All three met the same need, but how different their approaches were.  Therefore, they did not agree. </blockquote><br><br>  <b>How to know in advance what is important for a person</b> <br><br>  The life experience of most adults is enough to cope with this task, but it will be easier if we make a certain classification.  Known to us since childhood, Nikolay Nosov in the works about Dunno identified the characters of the characters with their professions.  We will do the same and single out seven ‚Äúcharacteristic‚Äù professions: artist, surgeon, politician, nanny, poet, master of ceremonies and accountant.  Unlike Nosov, we don‚Äôt have a task to create a satirical description, so let's talk about the representatives of these professions as they are, with all the pluses and minuses.  Moreover, each of us to some extent combines them in themselves.  From this description we will want two things: first, how to recognize;  secondly, we learn what is important for these people. <br><br>  <b>An artist is</b> hard not to notice, he is bright.  In its brightness, it can be beautiful, and can be terrible, just like on stage.  Attention is important to this person.  His activity and cooperation end with the extinction of attention and also resume. <br><br>  <b>The surgeon is</b> often firmly folded, neatly dressed, and can be rude to joke.  Order is important for him, including in relationships.  At the same time, he himself determines what is order and what is not.  From others, he expects controllability and predictability. <br><br>  <b>The politician</b> is trying to be clear for the masses in everything.  He dresses clearly, clearly speaks.  It is important to achieve the goal.  He will support any idea that will help him in this. <br><br>  In communication with the <b>nanny</b> you will feel caring about yourself.  You will be surprised how thin this person feels around.  Her harmony is important.  She will support your idea to support you.  The only thing she does not accept is insincerity. <br><br>  <b>The poet</b> sometimes puzzles.  His gaze is directed inward.  Often, he asthenic physique with excessive facial hair.  The originality of his ideas is amazing.  Sometimes it is difficult for him to understand what is acceptable in society and what is not.  It is important to him that the idea was as original as possible.  It is possible that he wants to add originality from himself. <br><br>  But the <b>toastmaster</b> on the contrary directs his gaze to the outside.  He wants to talk, joke, relax.  This is expressed in his appearance, in the design of the working space, in themes for jokes and conversations.  For him, the drive is important, more precisely it is important that it is not limited in this drive. <br><br>  And finally, <b>an accountant</b> .  This man is a habit.  Hyper responsibility helps him successfully cope with complex routine functions.  Sometimes they try to increase it, but it avoids everything new.  Such a person will be grateful to you if your idea allows him to leave everything as it is.  For him it is very important! <br><br><blockquote>  There are lots of examples of this classification. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cdf/cc3/cc6/cdfcc3cc67cadcdd7b7d58a62dee3ea4.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  For example, recently I saw a plastic card offer at Sberbank.  The number of variants is also 7, the design and essence of the sentences exactly correspond to the characters described above. </blockquote><br><br>  In addition, I can say that some people own several ‚Äúprofessions‚Äù equally.  For most, the leading ‚Äúprofession‚Äù is one. <br><br>  <b>Sell ‚Äã‚Äãan idea in 60 seconds</b> <br><br>  Resistance is not a failure, it is a natural state of a person; <br><br>  We are looking for the way in which a person is accustomed to meet a specific need and define his ‚Äúprofession‚Äù; <br><br>  We make a proposal so that: first, its need is met;  secondly, in a way desirable for him;  thirdly, referring to what is important to him. <br><br>  <b>See you!</b> <br><br>  On November 13, at the online conference <b><a href="http://propeople.stratoplan.ru/">Stratoplan PRO + People</a></b> I will <b><a href="http://propeople.stratoplan.ru/">hold</a></b> a 2-hour master class ‚ÄúHow to sell an idea‚Äù, where I will talk about this method in detail. <br><br>  Participation in the conference fee: 980 rubles.  for 5 workshops.  &gt; 250 people have already become participants. <br><br>  Join and book the next week's evenings for yourself!  (If it does not turn out to participate live - it does not matter, the team of the School of managers "Stratoplan" will send records of all master classes to all participants). <br><br>  <b>See you at the conference!</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/242567/">https://habr.com/ru/post/242567/</a></p>
