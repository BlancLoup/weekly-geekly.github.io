The forum was addressed by the founder and CEO of the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uber">Uber</a> taxi taxi service Travis Kalanik. <br><br>  ‚ÄúI spent my years in traffic jams in Los Angeles, thinking about how I can save the city from this.  And in the end, to some extent, it turned out, " <a href="http://sputnik.by/society/20160323/1021175869.html">said the</a> head of Uber during the speech.  Moreover, he believes that in 10-20 years unmanned vehicles will replace traditional cars. <br><br>  Earlier, Kalanik sold some of his shares to Uber.  One of the journalists asked the entrepreneur if he was considering selling the entire company. <a name="habracut"></a>

      However, the CEO of Uber said that the sale of part of the shares was planned as part of a startup development strategy. <br><br>  ‚ÄúWhat kind of reaction do you expect if you ask a happy married man, who will be his next wife?‚Äù, The company‚Äôs founder asked a counter question.  ‚ÄúI had wives,‚Äù he continued with a smile.  ‚ÄúBut now I‚Äôm focused on only one (Uber),‚Äù the TASS businessman said. <br><br>  ‚ÄúOver the past 1.5 years we have raised $ 10 billion, so we have money.  Our partners attract billions of dollars and go into debt.  However, our task is to be disciplined in setting up a business, ‚Äùhe added. <br><br>  Kalanik made it clear that in the near future he does not plan to sell the business or leave the post of general director. <br><br>  Meanwhile, on March 23, at a press conference in Minsk, another possible withdrawal was discussed.  It's about rumors about leaving the service from Belarus.  Uber feels strong opposition from traditional taxi services in the capital.  This was stated in a statement made by representatives of the company.  The media reported that some Uber partners are deprived of licenses for violating the law. <br><br>  Uber does not intend to leave Belarus, <a href="http://naviny.by/rubrics/auto/2016/03/23/ic_articles_120_191261/">said</a> a company <a href="http://naviny.by/rubrics/auto/2016/03/23/ic_articles_120_191261/">spokeswoman</a> for the CIS countries Yevgenia Shipova.  Moreover, she added, Minsk demonstrates the record pace of Uber development - here the company develops faster than it did in Moscow, Rome or Warsaw.  For four months, 80 thousand people used the Uber service in Minsk, and the application downloaded 580 thousand users. <br><br>  Uber came to Minsk in November 2015, offering its premium UberBLACK platform to users.  On February 5, 2016, the service launched a budget version with lower UberX tariffs in Minsk, and soon the Minsk City Executive Committee Chairman Andrei Shorets ordered to check the company's work in connection with the claims of metropolitan taxi drivers about unequal working conditions. <br><br>  However, Uber also does not miss the chance to make claims to other taxi services. <br><br>  Yesterday, March 23, <a href="http://www.rbc.ru/technology_and_media/23/03/2016/56f26f549a7947f643272c91">it became</a> known that Uber accused Indian rival <a href="https://www.olacabs.com/">Ola Cabs</a> of creating 90 thousand fake accounts and ordering 400 thousand fake trips.  This is done to undermine the credibility of Uber from the drivers, according to the company.  In addition to the mass cancellation of orders, the American service faced fake news about the success of Ola.  According to Uber, the news is not true. <br><br>  The lawsuit filed in the High Court of Delhi County.  The hearings are scheduled for September 14th. <br><br>  According to Uber, the damage from the actions of Ola will be 500 million Indian rupees (about $ 7.5 million): about 20 thousand drivers, misled by an Indian company, refused to cooperate with Uber.  The plaintiff asks the court to ban the activities of Ola. <br><br>  Ola rejects accusations: a representative of the company called the lawsuit Uber "idle talk and distortion of facts," <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-03-23/uber-sues-ola-claiming-fake-bookings-as-india-fight-escalates">reports</a> Bloomberg. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/299616/">https://habr.com/ru/post/299616/</a></p>
