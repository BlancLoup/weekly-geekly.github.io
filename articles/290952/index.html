  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Useful resources for finding internships in France</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello friends! <br><br>  Today, I would like to discuss with you not so much training, as the opportunity to have an internship abroad and earn extra money for training abroad.  In this article, I have gathered for your information the best resources for finding internships in France, and I will be very grateful for the distribution of this article.  It's very easy to do this with the help of social networking icons at the end of the article. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Unfortunately, for students who speak only English, it will be difficult to find an internship for themselves, and I, in turn, cannot tell you what and how, since my second language is Italian.  And so, a list of resources for finding internships in France: <br><br>  The first option for an internship search is offered by the French learning magazine L'√âtudiant.

      L'√âtudiant is a French monthly magazine that specializes in education information. <br>  Link to internship search: <a href="http://jobs-stages.letudiant.fr/">http://jobs-stages.letudiant.fr/</a> <br><br>  Next on the list is the iQuesta website, which positions itself as one of the leading job search portals, internships for university graduates in France. <br><br>  iQuesta is a bulletin board specializing in internships and job search for young university graduates;  on the market for almost 15 years.  Link to internship search: <a href="http://www.iquesta.com/">http://www.iquesta.com/</a> <br><br>  One of the possible options for you, dear readers, may be a little-known portal search for internships in France - Direct Etudiant. <br><br>  Direct Etudiant is not a leader in the alumni and undergraduate sector, but the company has a lot of experience, due to a long stay in the market.  In narrow circles, this is a well-known portal, with a slightly outdated interface, but with working functionality. <br>  Link to the internship search: <a href="http://www.directetudiant.com/">http://www.directetudiant.com/</a> <br><br>  For those who want more independence in choosing internships in France, Studyrama is for you. <br><br>  Studyrama Group is an independent media group founded in 1989 that specializes in student life and career success.  Includes journals and academic publications, websites and event management related to the group‚Äôs key topics throughout France.  Link to the internship search: <a href="http://www.studyrama-emploi.com/">http://www.studyrama-emploi.com/</a> <br><br>  For anyone who wants to have a closer business relationship and has a legal education, the Village de la Justice portal is the best place for you. <br><br>  Village de la Justice is one of the oldest public sites in the legal field in France, created in 1997.  Following the example of the village, this site connects ‚Äúresidents‚Äù of all professions (lawyers, lawyers, notary staff, judges, law students, service providers ...). <br><br>  The forum is a key component of the portal, but among other things, the site has a section ‚ÄúWork and Internship‚Äù where law students can find a job or practice for themselves.  Link to the internship search: <a href="http://www.village-justice.com/annonces/">http://www.village-justice.com/annonces/</a> <br><br>  Finally, good luck for students who speak English.  The site efinancialcareers.com (and fins.com) gives you the opportunity not only to look for work and internships in English, but also to look for it not only in France. <br><br>  The site efinancialcareers.com is a portal which publishes information about employment opportunities from the famous newspaper The Wallstreetjournal.  The site was launched in July 2009 by Dow Jones &amp; Company, and serves as a career platform and center for employment advice. <br><br>  Efinancialcareers.com as a whole is focused on such specialties as marketing, information technology, finance, accounting, sales, IT technology, etc.  Link to internship and job search: <a href="http://www.efinancialcareers.fr/en/">http://www.efinancialcareers.fr/en/</a> <br><br>  Another breath of fresh air for students who speak English, and again, a huge database and offers, not only in France but also in other countries of the world. <br><br>  Thanks to All-Acad, you are able to search among 3000 grants in the field of science, research and industry all over the world at leading universities, colleges, schools, research institutes and companies. <br><br>  In areas such as mathematics, statistics, banking, finance, economics, econometrics, risk management, underwriting, statistics, medicine, biology, bioinformatics, genetics, marketing, big data mining, neurology, scientific computing, numerical analysis, high performance computing, robotics, pure mathematics, logic, algebra, number theory, analysis, geometry, topology, mathematics, education, mathematical physics, teaching, management science and much, much more. <br><br>  Link to internship and job search: <a href="http://www.all-acad.com/Jobs/Mathematics_Statistics">http://www.all-acad.com/Jobs/Mathematics_Statistics</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/290952/">https://habr.com/ru/post/290952/</a></p>
