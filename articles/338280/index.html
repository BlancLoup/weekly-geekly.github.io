  <section class="page js-page"><h1>From the doctor to the system administrator: is there life in IT after the Hippocratic Oath?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Writing this post inspired me to read my other post, in all senses, by my colleagues: " <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/338232/">From a surgeon to a developer: how can I change my profession in 40 years?</a> " <br><br>  The fact is that our destinies with the author are generally alike.  I also graduated from the medical faculty of the Samara State Medical University - in 2001.  I also work in an IT company in a leadership position (only not a developer, but a Linux system analyst with a bias in DevOps).  He also received a second higher education as an external higher education - not for the sake of knowledge, but solely in order to have a diploma.  The difference is that I left right after the institute, managed to work in the pharmaceutical business, in sales, and even as the IT chief in one of the hospitals (and this is the hardest experience that can be in the IT profession - it really helped, I was a doctor ).  Now here is the next step. <br><br>  There is nothing extraordinary in such a career.  This is the usual story of a man who decided to leave medicine.  Yes, by the age of 40, the author and I are both middle-level managers in the IT field.  If they stayed to work as doctors, this would correspond to the position of the head of the department (with comparable income). <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Through all the reviews to the post colleagues refrain pass two main thoughts.  The first is how great it is that you left the beggar‚Äôs salary and do what you like!  The second is how terrible the medicine is in Russia, that the doctors are fleeing from it, but in Holland / USA / Czech Republic / the country of dreams is impossible in taste, doctors have a decent income there!

      Both of these thoughts are completely naive.  Citizens, in general, build an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãpeople in white coats on the basis of the scanned TV series "Interns".  The doctor for them is a creature romanticized and mysterious. <br><br>  It's easier, probably, to explain to people their misconceptions in the form of a small FAQ. <br><br><h3>  Who leaves medicine? </h3><br>  People usually leave smart enough and active.  Smart, to understand that they have not found themselves in this field and will never find.  Active, to have the determination to change everything overnight.  In my group there were 9 people, 7 people left the medicine (including me), moreover, one of the two remaining people almost never practices, but solves the issues of healthcare organization.  The second is fine, he is a successful surgeon, and the official salary of 20 thousand rubles does not bother him at all.  True, our group, perhaps, is not an indicator - it was experimental, all medal school students gathered there. <br><br><h3>  Where to go out of medicine? </h3><br>  Usually they go to the pharmaceutical business - to medical representatives.  There is enough written about medical representatives, there is a book ‚ÄúHow I have sold Viagra‚Äù, there is even a site for combating the pharmaceutical business.  Who cares, what kind of animals, can familiarize yourself. <br><br>  Also, doctors often go to any other (and not only pharmaceutical) salespeople - the level of cynicism, the suspended language and the ‚Äúdoctor by education - the highest caste‚Äù worldview contribute to this.  They go to insurance companies, or they open their own near-medical business. <br><br>  IT professionals rarely leave medicine.  But not so rarely, that right it was a unique case.  Even in the USA there is an example - take Bioware company here.  Doctors made masterpiece Baldurs Gate and Planescape. <br><br><h3>  Why IT doctor - a rarity? </h3><br>  Medical education is probably the least likely to get a person who has received this education to start working on computers.  The learning process is a blunt brewing and the almost complete absence of technical disciplines.  Medicine is generally a dark matter.  There are a lot of little-studied processes so far, a placebo effect, suppression of the opinion of colleagues by the authority of the luminaries, a bunch of experimental methods from the category ‚Äúlet's try on rats.  Works?  Well, lead the volunteers "... <br><br>  There are very few clear working algorithms.  What worked on one patient will turn out to be completely ineffective for the other, or even destructive, and why you can only guess so.  There is, of course, evidence-based medicine, but doctors stubbornly prefer to rely on their own experience or on the statements of representatives of pharmaceutical companies.  For medical representatives, evidence-based medicine is a dialogue "- Prove it! - I swear to Mom!" <br><br>  In short, medicine is one continuous dance with a tambourine.  What people of IT and near-professional professions are working on is the basic method of medical and scientific activities in medicine.  It must be admitted that we still don‚Äôt really know in full even about the seemingly elementary states of the human body.  Take the same appendicitis.  The simplest operation is an appendectomy, which, in theory, must be able to perform under emergency conditions any person with a medical degree (as well as a tracheostomy).  Every doctor knows the symptoms of the disease and diagnostic methods.  And what causes it?  And why does it occur in some people, and does not occur in others?  Yes, hell knows, and do not break your head, you're a surgeon?  So cut to hell, not waiting for peritonitis. <br><br><h3>  Why so many bad surgeons? </h3><br>  At the end of the institute, the only thing that the young doctor perfectly masters is cynicism and indifference to human suffering and death.  He is not capable of any independent work, and no one will allow him to do it - specialization is needed.  During the basic training, many students from the first year attended classes in their future specialty.  But even more young doctors choose specialization in the last year, and choose purely speculative - where there are free places, which specialty is more fashionable and in demand, where they pay more. <br><br>  For guys, of course, it will be natural to choose a surgeon's specialization.  Male work, prestigious, monetary - in fact, not therapists and gynecologists to go?  Moreover, all kinds of surgeries have a mass - there are general surgeons, there are thoracic surgeries, there are urologists, there are neurosurgeons, there are LORs - in general, to list for a long time, just believe, there is something to choose from. <br><br>  However, suddenly it turns out that not everyone can be a surgeon either.  And that not every young surgeon will have a second Amos, Ratner or Pirogov.  Moreover, qualification, of course, correlates with the length of service, but to certain limits.  You can even work for 20 years as a surgeon, and at the same time you will be trusted with maximum felon and ingrown nails - and even that they won't send a good friend to you, just any lumpen and beggar. <br><br>  The classic example of a failed surgeon is Zhenya Lukashin from ‚ÄúTwist of Fate‚Äù, who works as a surgeon in an outpatient clinic.  In the clinic!  Who does he operate there?  Maximum, writes illegible handwriting "Goden" in the medical card after the question "Complaints to the surgeon there?" <br><br>  But in most cases, a person remains in the profession is not a complete mediocrity (they are still trying to get rid of these), and the usual middling, realizing that he has already reached his ceiling, and you can‚Äôt jump over your head.  Many of them just drink too much, or go to administrative work, or even dump them out of medicine. <br><br><h3>  How much does the surgeon actually get? </h3><br>  In the comments, many watered the keyboard with tears after reading about a salary of 20 thousand rubles, which was assigned to the main character. <br><br>  Actually, someone who is, and surgeons (those whose arms are inserted with the right end) - they just live well.  The whole thing, of course, thanks to the patients.  Patient gratitude is a system.  Patients are well aware of how much is in the envelope to give to the doctor.  The nurses and nurses, as well as other patients, are informed by the chain.  In Samara, for example, the operation is not too complicated, such as cholecystectomy, costs within a dozen.  For complex ones, such as removing a benign tumor, say, kidneys, thirty-thirty can tear off. <br><br>  You can, of course, give more.  You can not give anything at all - no one, in general, does not force them with a scalpel at the throat.  But the majority pays.  So accepted. <br><br>  In the month runs up the amount, it is comparable with the wage of the tmlid. <br><br><h3>  Why leaving medicine is not a reason for pride? </h3><br>  Because a significant part of life is wasted, and people twice younger have a huge head start.  Because you understand that initially choosing the right educational institution, you would be able to reach the current level 10 years earlier.  Because six years of life, at least you took someone's place - the place of the guy who did not pass the competition and would be an excellent doctor.  Which did not pass, in order for you to study as a doctor and become an IT specialist - even if it is very good. <br><br>  This is not a success story.  There is nothing to be ashamed of, but it is silly to be inspired by it. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/338280/">https://habr.com/ru/post/338280/</a></p>
