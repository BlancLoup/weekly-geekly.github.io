      In total there are two options for the color of this animal: white and black.  This review will consider the first option. <br><br><h4>  Arrival and picking </h4><br>  The tablet came in an ordinary cardboard box.  A box, though ordinary, but it should be noted its good quality.  In the process of ‚Äúcareful‚Äù delivery from China to Russia, only the corners suffered, everything else remained safe and sound. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/8cfdc9e0/748b2723/33b1a916/bd0808e4.jpg"><br><br>  At the beginning we are met by a package with a tablet, lying in a special bed.  Below, under the bed, everything else is hidden, complete.  In summary, the complete kit includes: <br><br>  1) Directly tablet <br>  2) Mediocre headphones <br>  3) MiniUSB wire <br>  4) Remote control <br>  5) Brief instructions <br>  6) Warranty card <br>  7) Terry pouch bag (maybe it was a gift from the store) <br>  8) Charger for an American outlet <br>  9) Creepy-looking adapter <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/1db7124a/16b2f988/792655b3/9fd1c543.jpg"><br><br>  Remote control closer: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/1b3ddb94/ee8ca5b7/048121c3/f8de3e5a.jpg"><br><br>  Case: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/ef00d2d2/4938b9e7/fb6c01ae/36c98bc0.jpg"><br><br>  Very good equipment.  None of this was involved by me for the entire short period of using the tablet, of course charging with a case. <br><br>  Separately, I ordered a case of dermatin, black.  But the cunning Chinese got it wrong and laid white. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/fe529fa9/93aafbe5/b1fd7e2a/a2aefe73.jpg"><br><br>  A cover of a very lousy quality and carried the persistent smell of China.  For this, he was evicted for a week on the balcony. <br><br><h4>  Appearance </h4><br>  Let's go back to the tablet.  He came true, white, as it was ordered. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/bebb92f4/e16995c8/16429369/48842b29.jpg"><br><br>  We present the sizes: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/74bb8c8a/93bef3a6/4776e972/4a7c729c.jpg"><br><br>  Specify the weight of the tablet: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/754b7a2c/e3df4f37/68c951b3/c402ce8f.jpg"><br><br>  Plastic is very pleasant to the touch and creates a feeling of monumentality of the tablet.  Small creaks when pressing, though present, but do not spoil the impression. <br><br>  <i>I will make a small digression.</i>  <i>By coincidence, I managed to test the tablet for strength.</i>  <i>At first, I used a book case in which the tablet is fastened with three clips, of dubious quality, only from two sides.</i>  <i>As you may have guessed, on one terrible day, the tablet banally slipped out of its case.</i>  <i>Having flown one and a half meters to the floor, the tablet took all the force of the impact by a corner and landed on the screen.</i>  <i>At this moment, the whole life, in the period of using the tablet, was swept up before me.</i>  <i>Anticipating the worst, but hoping for the best, I picked up the tablet from the floor.</i>  <i>What was my surprise when I had a working, looking like a new tablet without any scratches.</i>  <i>After this incident, the book cover was written off to the reserve and now lies idle.</i> <br><br>  On the front panel of the tablet there is an 8 inch capacitive screen, a pair of useless inscriptions, a number of convenient buttons, a trackball and a front 0.3 megapixel camera. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/31688969/ee2877b3/771b855b/1b92ad2b.jpg"><br><br>  Only on the right side of the tablet, you can see something interesting, namely a handful of useful and not so much connectors. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/80af0099/2d531fa6/e677d222/f64e6679.jpg"><br><br>  Most of which is hidden under the lid: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/0ba086bb/0f1ce7dd/b32f0f61/1b42a6aa.jpg"><br><br>  On the back of the tablet is a very useful leg-stand, a slot for speakers, explanatory inscriptions to the connectors and a cap under which the MicroSD slot is hidden. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/6f2f56a9/7e763b24/f7abab3c/c2e77438.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/0fc94d72/0666d8ba/8cd2f030/36d446b2.jpg"><br><br>  When you launch the tablet, it greets us with a pleasant vibration and blinking trackball.  I note that the launch takes 20-30 seconds of the owner's life. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/7eb55c29/20811721/e9efdd98/efc55e0f.jpg"><br><br>  After the tablet is fully launched, we see the standard unlock screen.  As I understand it, the tablet is completely naked android 2.2.1, without any shells and ryushechek.  The manufacturer has added only a few applications.  Such as: <br><br>  1) Advanced task killer <br>  2) Appinstaller <br>  3) FileBrowser <br>  4) VideoPlayer <br><br>  There was still some kind of miracle Chinese reading room, but it completely disappeared, after updating the firmware. <br><br><h4>  Interior </h4><br><h5>  Screen </h5><br>  Perhaps I'll start with the most important element of each tablet - the screen.  As already mentioned, the tablet uses an 8 inch capacitive screen, with a resolution of 1280 by 768 pixels.  Permission really corresponds to the stated.  The image is clear, the study of the Internet is convenient, uninterrupted breaks.  This is the biggest and perhaps the main advantage of the screen. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/67224872/d70ee343/ab862c89/f93ff133.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/3de66d73/7c39d89e/d1aa0b37/fe584a9a.jpg"><br><br>  The screen is bright enough.  In the room, as a rule, the penultimate level of brightness is sufficient.  On the street, unfortunately, only the maximum brightness saves, otherwise you can only see your reflection. <br><br>  Also, it has good viewing angles.  Tried to pass them on photos. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/f9c52154/43e56c39/06d1722e/b2b435c0.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/f0f419d6/13fcf3bd/2a89e2b7/7d5eba0d.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/5ba1736a/a0b6967c/948e4e5f/d041889e.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/2a981312/b277c584/d8702552/6b51da26.jpg"><br><br>  But it didn't work out very well.  Only in the standard tilt position, the screen has a small ‚Äúdead zone‚Äù at which the image is inverted.  On the other sides, the image fades only a little, as the tablet does not tilt. <br><br>  Next, I will list a couple of facts that, although they do not interfere with the work, but still spoil the impression: <br><br>  1) Slight jitter when touched. <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/t6nQLz8EmfM%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700255,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhhIZ2EptJCgQSSgEopYBohTcvZk4w" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  2) Patterned grid of sensors on the screen. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/bbe30124/54f75123/79020871/9b5f4fc7.jpg"><br><br><h5>  CPU / GPU / RAM </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/cad1cb40/604db1f6/d92e6395/8a84309a.jpg"><br><br>  There are no complaints here.  Absolutely.  Everything works as fast as possible on this version of the android.  Any video tablet lost without any problems.  Any game installed by me started and played.  All applications earned full screen.  Probably something should not earn, but in my arsenal there were no such applications.  If you are interested in something, write in the comments.  Run, check. <br><br>  Information from AnTuTu Benchmark v2.4: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/f1877b6d/0e30c294/bc5b56b6/47c04cff.png"><br><br>  AnTuTu Benchmark v2.4 test results: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/a2f169ea/3ab56955/6bcbb540/6019e6de.png"><br><br>  Quadrant Standard 1.1.7 test results: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/6d37eb03/7ee12677/2f49810a/7b36429b.png"><br><br>  Playing games: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/7AGvGYSxtQw%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700255,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhjfKWeKgUIQ8Jz18hacui6dX8m0XQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  We work with documents and pdf files: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/gTc3yakUjt8%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700255,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhh33OlHDFrqLug_ggS4oUTBTeat_g" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Watch movies: <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/ELV2NE4kkBI%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700255,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhhVEA7oEoTDwVN6IYSvFzsJd6IL_A" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h5>  Wireless connection </h5><br><h6>  Wi-fi </h6><br>  Works that can not but rejoice.  The reception level is average, but it attaches to the router without any problems, from anywhere in the apartment. <br><br><h6>  IR receiver </h6><br>  Required exclusively for the operation of the remote control.  The console itself works like a joystick or the same trackball. <br><br><h5>  Camera </h5><br>  There is, removes.  Quality certainly does not shine.  Typical Chinese camera, sufficient only for video. <br><br><h5>  Interfaces </h5><br><h6>  3.5 jack </h6><br>  It works great.  By the sound of no complaints.  High-quality, clear and without extraneous noise. <br><br><h6>  MiniUSB </h6><br>  Used exclusively for connecting to a PC. <br><br><h6>  Full USB </h6><br>  One of the biggest advantages of the tablet.  Without any adapters, the tablet easily handles flash drives, mice, keyboards, hard drives, modems, and other devices.  Conveniently. <br><br><h6>  HDMI </h6><br>  Check unfortunately I could not, there are no target devices.  Judging by the video works very well. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/MJW541LBPAc%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700255,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhilZUbKVTKPWd6bmPl1_-uWzZjErw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h6>  HDTV </h6><br>  Similarly.  Check failed because the video component signal in YPbPr format. <br><br><h5>  Microphone </h5><br>  Record quality is acceptable.  Recorded, at arm's length, the voice is heard quite well, and more is not needed. <br><br><h5>  Battery </h5><br>  Of course, this is the weakest point of the tablet.  Perhaps this tablet is not suitable for those for whom a long battery life is critical. <br><br>  The approximate time of the tablet for different situations: <br><br>  1) Work on the Internet, the minimum screen brightness: about 6 hours. <br>  2) Work on the Internet, 50% brightness: approximately 5 hours. <br>  3) Work on the Internet, 100% brightness: about 4 hours. <br>  4) Listening to music through headphones, the screen is off: more than 12 hours. <br>  5) Video viewing, 100% brightness, sound through headphones: about 3 and a half hours. <br><br><h4>  Firmware </h4><br>  The latest official firmware was released by Ainol at the end of July.  It was Android 2.2.1.  Very stable firmware, by the way.  The main innovations were support for 3g modems and the market.  More updates have not been and apparently not foreseen. <br><br>  At the end of August, another version of Android 2.2.1 firmware was released.  It was branded beta.  The firmware did not appear on the official site.  The differences remained a mystery to me.  On the basis of this firmware several mods were created. <br><br>  Most recently, a beta version of the firmware based on Android 2.3 was found on the Chinese forums.  The main change, in addition to the OS version, is overclocking the processor to 1 Ghz.  There have been no reviews of the quality of this firmware. <br><br>  At about the same time, the unofficial port of CyanogenMod 7 (Android 2.3.7) was posted.  Surprisingly, he was very, very working.  Of the main disadvantages: <br><br>  - Camera does not work <br>  - Hardware video decoding does not work <br>  - MIC is not working <br><br>  The test results listed above are made in this firmware. <br><br><h4>  Total </h4><br><h5>  pros </h5><br>  - High screen resolution <br>  - The quality of the assembly and materials <br>  - Good performance <br>  - Remote control <br>  - Full USB <br>  - Low price (about $ 189 for version 8 Gb) <br><br><h5>  Minuses </h5><br>  - Trembling point of touch ( <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3Dt6nQLz8EmfM">video</a> ) <br>  - Average battery life <br>  - No updates from the manufacturer <br><br>  That's all.  I hope this review will help someone in the difficult agony of choosing a tablet.  :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/131724/">https://habr.com/ru/post/131724/</a></p>
