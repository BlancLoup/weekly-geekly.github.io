  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Latest statistics reports on smartphones: in Russia and not only</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  An IDC study confirmed that the market for Android smartphones is growing mainly due to low-cost models.  According to the results of the second quarter of this year, it is reported that 58.6% of all released smartphones with the Google system cost less than $ 200.  IDC analysts believe that in the light of the recent submission to the public Android One with possible devices costing less than $ 100, the observed trend in the future only strengthened.  However, according to the latest news, in the framework of the same Android One, not everything is so simple, while there are disputes about the final price between Google and [Indian] manufacturers, the latter are seeking to set a bar at least $ 150.  Anyway, at the same time IDC celebrates Android‚Äôs special success in emerging markets. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/030/b80/bf4/030b80bf453f4ee5816f4f7968be3f69.jpg"><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Actually, the report is mainly devoted to the balance of power between mobile systems.  As of the second quarter, the situation with the release of smartphones and the share of mobile operating systems is as follows:

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7c5/259/ccf/7c5259ccfd8e4bf895b738c0c301ab9b.jpg"><br><br>  Android has a new quarterly record, in general, over the past three years, the share of the platform has almost doubled.  Samsung has dominated the production of smartphones with 29.3%, but we are no longer talking about a total monopoly - the company lost 10.7% in two years.  Interestingly, among the competitors of Samsung that have strengthened their positions, IDC analysts mainly cite Chinese manufacturers - Coolpad, Huawei, Lenovo, Xiaomi and ZTE. <br><br>  Meanwhile, just the other day for the entire first half of 2014, Svyaznoy reported.  As it turned out, perhaps the main driver in sales of smartphones were devices with the support of two or more SIM-cards, in total they diverged in the amount of 5 million units in the amount of 27 billion rubles.  If we take the figures in piece terms, then the multi-slot devices made up almost half of all the models sold.  The growth rate was 139% in physical terms and 87% in monetary terms.  I think it‚Äôs not worth yet to voice the reasons why people in Russia have a special love for dvuhsimochnikami, which a couple of years ago and for the "real" smartphones did not particularly hold.  Here HTC turned out to be the most progressive, which was the first among the manufacturing giants to release a two-part version of its flagship HTC One (M8). <br><br>  An analytical report of MTS for the second quarter of 2014 was published today.  The average price of smartphones (to be exact - the average check) fell in comparison with the same period last year by 15% to 7,081 rubles.  Sales figures are consistent with the findings of IDC: manufacturers focus on low-end models, and buyers prefer them.  In the case of retail, MTS sold twice as many smartphones up to 5,000 rubles than in the second quarter of 2013.  In the range of 10-15 thousand rubles, the growth for the year was 81%, but this was affected by the private approach of MTS, the company was actively engaged in sales of flagship devices of previous years.  Apple is not experiencing any discomfort - the company refused to work under direct contracts, as a result, in the MTS network alone, the iPhone had almost 4 thousand stores across Russia.  The result - an increase of more than 300 times and 7% of total smartphone sales. <br><br>  Sales of LTE smartphones increased 3.5 times; in total, they accounted for a quarter of the devices sold.  Not to say that Russian B-brands have a confident position here, of the latest models, only the Explay 4Game that has just appeared, and the recent Highscreen Spider, come to mind.  Well, how not to remember about Yota YotaPhone. <br><br>  PS All the same IDC secretly told CNews some details of the results of the Russian tablet market in the second quarter.  With the exception of Lenovo, all participants in the TOP-5 lowered the level of supply of devices, and only Samsung and Apple had record drops.  The first one reduced deliveries by 48.3%, and the second company - by 54%.  In general, the volume fell by 9.8%, which in IDC is associated with the saturation of the market, the economic situation and the leisure of users in changing their current ‚Äúpills‚Äù. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/233517/">https://habr.com/ru/post/233517/</a></p>
