  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Three whales</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Habr√© has a regular discussion about quality and fruitful work.  I want to describe my observations and my applications of the ‚Äútechnology‚Äù that I use in my work.  Maybe someone has already written or thought about it, I will also be glad to hear your additions and comments.  This technology cannot be called universal, but I think for many this information will be very useful.  Information is more oriented on programmers, but I think it will be useful to read others. <br><br><h4>  Three whales consist of: </h4><br>  1. Scope of work <br>  2. Time <br>  3. Knowledge. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Now in order. </h4><br><br><h5>  1. Volume </h5><br>  If you are working on a big project that always has work, the main thing is not to get out of control.  It is necessary to take the volume that you can do and of course raise this bar constantly.  It can be argued that quality is lost, but everyone decides to either do little but qualitatively, or quickly, but skip some details and, when testing, ‚Äúfile‚Äù their mistakes, but feel comfortable, because  the work has already been done to some extent.

      If the projects are small and a lot of them.  You can and should learn to click them as a sunflower.  With such work, these small projects are often repeated, it is already possible <i>to think about</i> how to solve the same problem next time.  Most often they write or use cms or their libraries. <br><br><h5>  2. Time </h5><br>  Everyone knows how much a person spends time at work thoughtlessly or not fruitfully.  We must always remember that time can not be bought, not to squander back.  <i>When a person appreciates his time, he always spends it profitably,</i> and if he does not succeed in it, it always saddens him. <br><br>  You should always link volume + time.  First of all, set a <i>goal for</i> yourself that you make such a volume in such a time and at least ‚Äúdie‚Äù but do it.  The main thing is not to overdo it, do not put a large amount in a short time.  You can start with a simple and small, but constantly raise the bar.  As you can see, the first and second points are very connected, but you need to fasten it to the third and, in my opinion, it is very important to your knowledge. <br><br><h5>  3. Knowledge </h5><br>  How much work time do you lose on viewing information on your work?  If a lot, then you can take as a rule to find out everything outside working hours.  What is the use?  During the work you will always be concentrated and will not be distracted by climbing over each question in the search engine. <br><br>  For example, I ask the project manager what we will do during the week.  Also what to read, so as not to do it during working hours ( <s>although it permits</s> ).  It is important to understand that theory and practice are slightly different things.  <i>Know how to do it in theory, it is not 100% implementation in practice</i> , I often come across ‚Äúpitfalls‚Äù. <br><br><h5>  Conclusion </h5><br>  These three whales are very interrelated.  In my opinion, if you remove one of them, there can be no talk of fruitful and high-quality work.  You can also ‚Äútwist‚Äù them for yourself and make a different structure of the work plan. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/76399/">https://habr.com/ru/post/76399/</a></p>
