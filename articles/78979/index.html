  <section class="page js-page"><h1>MTS and M.B.A. Finance "against customers</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  As recently as a month ago, my sister received the first notice of a certain debt on a certain phone number.  The number is not registered to it, which is confirmed by the MTS company.  Several times they called, once my sister went to the service office.  They see and understand everything perfectly, but they cannot do anything, as it turned out.  The first trip ended with a call from an employee of the MTS service office to IBA Finance, where, in fact, they ‚Äúbeat out‚Äù the debts of MTS subscribers ... <br><a name="habracut"></a>  An employee of the MTS service office explained to the IBA Finance manager that the number indicated in the debt notification was never registered to my sister, it was issued to another person.  It would seem that everything should be in order.  A couple of days later my sister was called on a mobile phone (already the number registered on her) and again insistently asked to pay a non-existent debt.  They phoned to the MTS support service, talked to a financial specialist, who notified that there would be no more problems.  Already in December, or rather a couple of days ago, my sister was again called from IBA Finance and announced that they would soon file a lawsuit.  Today we received a letter in which they demand to pay a non-existent debt.  The letter also states that if the debt is not paid within 3 days, IBA Finance will sue.  I went to the MTS service office.  In my presence, a service center employee sent an email notification letter to IBA Finance.  After 30 minutes, I rang up already at IBA Finance, where I was notified that no data had been received from MTS and the proceedings in the debt business would continue.  Yes, the debt is only 300 rubles.  Someone will say that it is easier to pay.  But.  If you pay this amount - you acknowledge that you are the debtor in advance and IBA Finance will stick the debtor‚Äôs stamp on the name specified in the debt notice.  For your information, IBA Finas works with a huge number of different large companies, whose services we all use almost every day. <br>  In a couple of hours I will call the fin.  MTS specialist, who, in theory, should put an end to solving this issue. <br>  If there are representatives of the MTS company on Habr√©, I would like to receive relevant comments.  Why employees of your company can not solve the problem caused by their fault?  Who said that the solution to this problem should be shifted onto the client‚Äôs shoulders?  And the most important question is whether MTS understands that such jambs go to a minus of their reputation? <habracut><br><br>  <b>upd1:</b> Get to fin.  specialist - a separate story.  40 minutes trying to ring out.  The countdown to the response of the operator goes upwards every minute.  Funny. <br><br>  <b>upd2:</b> After 45 minutes of waiting - I got through.  It's funny that they asked to call back tomorrow, now they can not help.

      <b>upd3:</b> Yesterday a representative of the MTS company contacted me, for which there is a special thank you (I would like very much that no one of your company's clients would have such problems anymore. A lot of hassle).  Today my sister called and already more or less lead the existing problem.  I hope that soon everything will be resolved and until the end of the year the case opened in IBA Finance will be closed.  Upd4 I will write off already a separate post. <br><br>  <b>ps</b> Thanks to everyone who gave advice.  In such situations, many of them come in handy. <br><br>  <b>Continued:</b> <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/prava/79241">habrahabr.ru/blogs/prava/79241</a> </habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/78979/">https://habr.com/ru/post/78979/</a></p>
