  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Bitcoin wallet implanted under the skin</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  An entrepreneur working with bitcoins and an enthusiastic biohacker found an interesting place to store electronic currency - right under his skin.  Martin Wismeyer, known as Mr. Bitcoin, implanted two NFC chips into his hands at a conference organized by <a href="http://www.permanentbeta.nl/">Permanent Beta</a> . <br><br>  Communicating with CoinDesk representative Wismayer, he said that he had already tried to store litecoin, darkcoin, dogecoin and bitcoin on small devices with a volume of 888 bytes each.  ‚ÄúAs long as you can export your private key, you can write it into your own hands,‚Äù he added.  Although the checks were successful, Vismayer does not intend to use them long enough to store their cryptocurrency.  As he said, this is because media coverage of the process compromised their safety. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/B9HcFxTM8hI%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjQLxR7f4JkMD3SKK_jbHCHwfwBkQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Nevertheless, he said that the chips are reliable and secretive storage system for those who are "shy" of video surveillance.  ‚ÄúIf you do not advertise the implant, no one will know about it.  Chips are not visible with a full body scan at airports.  Technology secret agents available to all users. "

    <h4>  Wow effect </h4><br>  Stumbling on Bitcoin in November 2010, Weissmeier was very interested in the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãblock chains.  "It made the same impression on me as the WWW in the early 90s."  Four years later, the Dutchman moved from mining bitcoins on an old laptop and messing with API to participate in the international project <a href="http://www.mrbitco.in/">ATM collective</a> , which installs Bitcoin ATMs around the world. <br><br><twitter-widget class="twitter-tweet twitter-tweet-rendered" id="twitter-widget-0" style="position: static; visibility: visible; display: block; transform: rotate(0deg); max-width: 100%; width: 500px; min-width: 220px; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;" data-tweet-id="467259675579523072"></twitter-widget><script async="" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><br><br>  Storing currency in the body is another experiment, albeit an extreme one.  DangerousThings Store, selling <a href="https://dangerousthings.com/shop/xnt-ntag216-2x12mm-glass-tag/">injection kits for $ 99</a> , warns that they were not authorized for use in humans.  Vismayer says that after about a day the pain disappears and then you can begin to test the operation of the chip. <br><br><h4>  Implant </h4><br>  The implant is a small 2 √ó 12 mm glass capsule containing an RFID tag, which is usually used to mark pets or products.  The label does not reject and does not require power.  It receives energy and data from smartphones, tablets, etc.  via NFC antenna.  ‚ÄúNo charge required, no batteries needed.  The device maintains 100,000 records, so it should, in principle, be enough for a lifetime, ‚Äùsaid Vismayer. <br><br>  Storage of cryptocurrency on the device is almost a painless process, not counting the installation.  First you need to disable the write protection.  Then, using an application like NXP Tagwriter, you write your private keys to your device as text tags, one key per line.  888 bytes can store 888 characters.  Total device can store up to 26 different <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Mini_private_key_format">mini-keys of 33 characters</a> .  If someone does not need so many keys, you can use <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0038.mediawiki">BIP-38</a> encryption, in which the key length is 58 characters.  Although reading does not wear out, data will be stored for about ten years.  Because of this, users will need to overwrite, update their tags approximately every ten years in order to avoid loss of information. <br><br><h4>  Use cases </h4><br>  The functionality of implants is still limited by their volume.  However, in the near future, this volume will be able to grow.  ‚ÄúI met with Amal Graafstroy, the engineer who designed this implant, and he is working on new models that will contain more information - however, they will be bigger in size, and you may have to somehow unfold them under the skin after installation.‚Äù <br><br>  In this area there are few specialists.  However, Vismayer believes that there are already about 3,000 people in the world with such implants.  In fact, the injection kit <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/the-xnt-implantable-nfc-chip">collected 383%</a> of the original $ 8000 target at Indiegogo last December.  And implants are constantly coming up with new uses.  For example, Vismayer wants to check his tags on the wireless door lock, and try to use them as an alarm switch. <br><br>  ‚ÄúI have been using these tags in real situations, my phones and tablets are compatible with them (Android only, sorry iOS lovers) for two years now.  I feel that by supporting these developments in the field of biohacking, we can learn what can and does not work. ‚Äù </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/362959/">https://habr.com/ru/post/362959/</a></p>
