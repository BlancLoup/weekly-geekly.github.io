Once all the information on the web was text.  There was no HTML, no CSS, no JavaScript.  Yet, it was the network that people used.  However, there were problems, the text was unformatted, and depending on the number of characters that fit on your monitor, the page could look anyway.  At this moment, people are thinking about formatting.  Appeared the first shoots of HTML.  This allowed to solve the problem with the number of columns on the screen.  Later came CSS, which solved the problem of how the browser should display the page.  Where what fonts should be used and what size should they be.

      At what point did the network become the Internet?  Answer.  At the moment when the links appeared.  This is what allowed to connect all the documents of the network together, and made it possible to navigate.  This was a turning point.  The Internet has become a huge document.  It is this metaphor that I propose to use when describing the Internet. <br><br>  Each technology is designed to solve a particular problem.  If the technology is created without a goal, then this technology will never take root.  It is the aimlessness of virtual worlds that seems to many to be the reason that they will never become widespread. <br><br>  The Internet is extremely static.  If you send an e-mail to China, then you must wait for the addressee to wake up and respond to your letter.  If you leave a message in the Brazilian forum, then you hope that someone will read it and respond to it.  It looks like throwing a ball into the dark, you do not know if there is a wall from which it will rebound or not.  Imagine that you now have the opportunity to "shake" the person to whom you sent the letter.  In addition, you can see that this person is now in front of you and is talking to you, and not doing something else.  That is what is achievable in the virtual worlds.  Just as the Internet is a metaphor for a huge document, virtual worlds are a metaphor for a huge space in which you can be at any point.  It sounds all, probably, too abstract.  Let's take a look at the specific applications of virtual worlds. <br><br>  1. The first, and probably most important, is the possibility of organizing virtual meetings.  To demonstrate, I think it's worth watching a video from Project Wonderland: <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/QcElCLv-AW0&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhjSPuUeaqO6ncEFeOu-dmFW1sGKUA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  2. Tourism.  Imagine that you are going to go to Disney Land.  What are you doing now?  You go to the site and study the map of the park.  And if you had the opportunity to walk on a copy of this park, before you go there.  This would allow you to get acquainted with all the attractions and in reality go exactly where you want.  And if you add others like you, who are also exploring this park in the virtual world.  Together you could discuss this or that attraction.  And perhaps agree on when you could ride together on this attraction. <br><br>  3. Sale of clothes.  This is probably the most unprofitable business on the Internet.  Clothes need to measure and buy it from the picture is extremely difficult.  Now imagine that in the virtual world there is your copy with your size and physique.  You can see how this or that thing will look at you.  In addition, dozens of people can be in the same place with whom you can discuss your new outfit.  Realization of such an idea will produce another boom in online trading. <br><br>  4. Sale of real estate.  Instead of driving around the city and looking for a new apartment.  How can you walk through the same apartments and the same district, but in the virtual world, and see how it looks?  And maybe even talk to people who live there or will live.  And maybe rastavit furniture in a new house? <br><br>  This list can be continued indefinitely, just enough to think a little wider ... </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/42604/">https://habr.com/ru/post/42604/</a></p>
