  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Happy sys admin! Postcard with meaning</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Sysadmin is a favorite character of IT <s>anime</s> jokes and cool stories.  Who among us does not remember the cherished 4 words, mandatory for a successful quotation on the bashorge (if anyone does not remember - ‚Äúcat, Schr√∂der, admin, x * yase‚Äù) and did not empathize with Ithappens stories, who did not wear chocolates and beer in order to expand office limit.  Well, in general, we have already given our age, so further - only about the heroes of today's holiday, the Day of the system administrator.  Or rather, how are we here in 2018? <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fd/jw/oq/fdjwoqoiim0-7dc86atf6o5vizu.jpeg"></div>  <font color="#999999"><i>Snob.ru</i></font> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Our article will be written in a rather joking manner, more like a postcard to all of us, but remember - in each joke there is only a fraction of a joke.  The rest is true. <br><br><h2>  Waited for clouds, and the heat came </h2><br>  For many years we have been creating <a href="http://alloysoftware.ru/">solutions for the Service Desk and IT-assets management</a> , therefore, we often have been and have been to various kinds of meetings and conferences on the subject of near-admin and every kind of ITSM there.  Almost 10 years ago, experts predicted the imminent demise of the post of system administrator, telling fascinating stories about eternal printing devices, total clouds at every workplace, super secure networks and powerful scripts that can do everything (exclusively on Powershell, who else grab).  Someone listened to it with wide-open eyes, and someone more experienced smirked - such noodles on the ears did not linger.

Of course, we didn‚Äôt believe in the full world of an ideal IT infrastructure, but some moments could strain us. <br><br>  The world has indeed changed - but not in the way that the bright minds of theorists predicted.  It has become incredibly more difficult, and the IT infrastructure of even relatively small companies has become a monstrous system that tends to chaos: <br><br><ul><li>  iron went down in price, and companies began to buy their own servers, organize tiny server servers so as not to spend money on the very virtualization <br></li><li>  Companies still do not refuse desktop software due to its reliability, greater security and lower cost of ownership (the license is bought once, you do not need to pay a slave monthly rent for SaaS, which from 880 p. on the developer‚Äôs landing page turns into a couple of years hoo th) <br></li><li>  users are not so much smarter, but they are armed to the teeth and carry flash drives, external drives, smartphones, tablets, laptops, all connected to work PCs and networks - and these are potential security holes <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e55/f1a/46d/e55f1a46d6db0a3fa991aed9e92f802b.png" width="350"></div></li></ul><br><ul><li>  individual users who have learned how to use corporate IT infrastructure for their own needs from PCs and networks: from innocent games during working hours and changing video cards to serious thefts of commercial information and other unpleasant plums <br></li><li>  peripherals fell in price, and companies began to buy office equipment in lots: printers, scanners in each office, projectors in each meeting room, interactive screens, multimedia systems, wall-mounted monitors and so on. <br></li><li>  Finally, the development has changed and DevOps appeared in IT companies. <br></li></ul><br>  And this chaos needs a superhero.  Namely - a system administrator who is able in each company to solve combinations of these tasks, and sometimes all tasks at once. <br><br><h2>  Superhuman Superhero Abilities </h2><br>  Today, the system administrator, even in a small company, is not a guy with a beard and a stretched sweater, this is a specialist who is obliged to ensure the smooth operation of the entire IT park at least, otherwise the work of the rest will simply rise, because now absolutely all processes are tied to the use of technology: IP - telephony, networks, work PCs, mobile equipment, cameras, physical security circuit, etc.  Of course, gibberish and uneducated eternal enikeev is enough everywhere, but in 2018 its incompetence is almost impossible to hide. <br><br>  So, what admin should know and be able to be productive and competitive (except for his immediate professional knowledge). <br><br><ul><li>  <b>IT asset management techniques (ITAM, SAM, ITSM, ITIL, etc.).</b>  This does not mean that you should learn all the ITIL books and get the badge, but you need to know the principles and logic of asset management - simply because these are the best practices, and there really are good things to do. <br></li><li>  <b>Ways to save money by optimizing the IT infrastructure:</b> managing licenses, optimizing the use of software, combining virtualization and in-house capabilities, ways to manage printing in a company (especially with active workflow), etc. <br></li><li>  <b>Software ownership for monitoring</b> IT infrastructure, networks, server load, etc. <br></li><li>  <b>Methods of ensuring security</b> without completely tightening the screws in the workplaces of users, promptly responding to information security incidents (without on-the-spot executions). <br></li><li>  <b>Knowledge and understanding of the principles of DevOps</b> - this is true more for employees of software companies. <br></li><li>  <b>Automation of the</b> routine work of the system administrator and automation of user management - if the system administrator does not know how to write cool and useful scripts (Powershell, Python, etc.), then he is either not lazy enough or just not a superhero. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9ca/ee4/798/9caee479839eb0fe4e32aded6eff195f.png"><br><br>  <font color="#999999"><i>Suffering, pain, hell</i></font> <font color="#999999"><i><br></i></font>  <font color="#999999"><i>Windows powershell</i></font> </li></ul><br><ul><li>  <b>Ability to work with virtualization and various * aaS.</b>  A sysadmin superhero must possess administrative skills that combine hardware, software and the ability to work with application programming tasks (APIs). <br></li><li>  Advanced <b>routing and switching skills</b> .  This skill requires communication networks and IP telephony, which in any office and at any scale should work with a minimum failure threshold. <br></li><li> <b>Desire and ability to learn.</b>  New technologies and ways of working with them appear continuously, and you need to be able to study them, to understand whether it is worth introducing it into work and making an objective decision.  No one knows where the fate of a sysadmin will take tomorrow: in the world of distributed computing, in Kubernetes or in the Docker. <br></li><li>  <b>Understanding business</b> - the system administrator should be a supporter of the business, not a pest in the name of his laziness.  Decisions on software implementation, virtualization, equipment supply, inventory, etc.  must be taken precisely on the basis of the real objective needs of the company.  Do not give up equipment or software just because you do not want to increment the zoo.  Be professional. <br></li></ul><br>  And of course, superpowers will not get rid of a single system administrator from twisted wires, packaged layouts, plucked plugs of system managers, disconnected by playful pens of antiviruses, up to 1C pain and perturbed accounting, chewed on paperclip printers, spilled toners, broken mice, flooded keyboards.  Well, are we in these moments thinking about the eternal and our great destiny?  Trivia affect only the weak. <br><br><h2>  How to help a sysadmin? </h2><br>  On the Day of the system administrator, we will leave the wishes of colleagues and colleagues in the iron and software battles at the end, and in this section we‚Äôll tell you that it is worth being a little more attentive and wiser to facilitate the life of the person who ensures your work and keeps the first line of defense of all techno business ecosystems. <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Do not lie to the admin.</b>  If there is a problem and you know what the reason (or exactly) is, be sure to tell us how it was.  You are unlikely to be fired for this, and the admin will not wrestle with how it turned out. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/83b/7ca/e2d/83b7cae2daf902d0ec1d20de434e6d4e.png"><br>  <font color="#999999"><i>rm -fr Removes all French files from the system.</i></font> <br></li></ul><br><ul><li>  <b>Do not leave it without tools.</b>  If you are a CEO, CTO, CIO, and it depends on you which antiviruses, application applications, monitoring tools, inventory, equipment should be purchased for the operation of the IT infrastructure, discuss this with the system administrator.  If only because it is he who will have to work with this.  Admins rarely want to have software, because it's cool (as opposed to commerce), most often they want this or that software or hardware, because it knows a lot and is as functional as possible. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/832/b12/185/832b121853ff6068390e2734703f727c.png" width="350"></div>  <font color="#999999"><i>Imgur</i></font> <font color="#999999"><i><br><br></i></font>  <font color="#999999"><i>Everything works: Hey, IT specialist, and why are we the only ones paying you?</i></font> <font color="#999999"><i><br></i></font>  <font color="#999999"><i>Something broke: Hey, IT specialist, and why are we the only ones paying you?</i></font> </li></ul><br><ul><li>  <b>Try not to break what is already broken.</b>  If you feel that the files have disappeared, the mail is not working, the virus has appeared, the crash has crashed, the test server is not working, do not try to fix the problem yourself - call a professional, he will cope.  Standing over your head and giving advice is also not necessary. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3b3/b94/74e/3b3b9474e6e775b7152fcb3765b9ece5.png" width="350"></div>  <font color="#999999"><i>Imgur</i></font> <font color="#999999"><i><br><br></i></font>  <font color="#999999"><i>- What is your internet browser?</i></font> <font color="#999999"><i><br></i></font>  <font color="#999999"><i>- Pfff, what a stupid question.</i></font>  <font color="#999999"><i>Windows xp</i></font> </li></ul><br><ul><li>  <b>Describe the problem in human language and accurately.</b>  No need to speak in broken technical language or words that you read in funny stories about admins.  Describe the problem clearly, in the case and without fantasy. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e23/5ea/a61/e235eaa6127c01968777599d5e829d1c.png"></div><br></li></ul><br><ul><li>  <b>Use the ticket system</b> (if, of course, you have it) - give the admin a chance to prioritize tasks and plan working time and resources.  From one hundred calls in a row, the Internet will not appear and the server will not rise. <br></li><li>  <b>Let the admin have lunch!</b>  No, well, really - be people, do not call and do not interrupt messengers, if he said that he wants to eat or drove off for consumables.  This kind of attitude annoys you. <br></li></ul><br>  In short, the recipe is simple: be human and respect the work of the system administrator. <br>  And to you, dear colleagues-sysadmins, we wish you successful work, calm nerves, thoughtful and rational users, not burning front-breakers, reliable equipment, great music in headphones, tasty and hot (!) Coffee in a mug, cold beer and eager pizza. <br><br>  Chin-chin, friends, we drink for you and for us! <br><br><hr><br>  If you need an ITIL Service Desk system or IT infrastructure management and inventory system, contact AlloySoftware - <a href="http://www.alloysoftware.ru/products/alloy-navigator/"><b>Alloy Navigator 8.1 is</b></a> fiery, and even in Russian (with documentation together).
