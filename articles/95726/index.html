  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Kyuubi - not only valuable microservices, but also a search engine</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Last month, the Kyuubi was one year old, and I think it's time to talk about what has been done and what remains to be.  It so happened that for the last six months I was busy with my other projects, which made it impossible to fully develop the Kyuubi, but this did not prevent me from introducing a number of innovations into it over the past few weeks. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/da/cb/dacbd3efb70608fadfa05fc7392d7fcc.png" alt="search in kyuubi"></div><br><br>  The key decision was to develop the Kyuubi as a search engine.  Already, the number of search queries per day has passed a psychological barrier of 1000, and by agreement with Yandex, the monetization of the search has begun.  Monetization passes a little blood through contextual advertising. 
      <br>

        </script>
      <br>
      In connection with this decision, we are building ambitious plans: to increase the number of search queries 10 times and enter the top 10 search engines of Belarus. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The first thing that was done in a search engine is the correction of errors in queries, search hints and the display of icons of found sites.  But this seemed to me not enough, and I added some interesting and useful functions. <br><br><h4>  Advisors </h4><br>  Perhaps I will tell you about them first.  The advisers are engaged in parallel search in various additional sources and, if they find anything, give the user an additional result on his request: whether it be a translation of the requested words, a place on the map (for Minsk) or the user's IP address.  The closest analogue of advisers is Yandex Warlock.  Advisers love to advise and work on certain words in the request: all kinds of variations of the ‚Äústreet‚Äù, ‚Äútranslation‚Äù or ‚ÄúIP address‚Äù in the Russian and Belarusian languages. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/44/32/4432d70e7fe534ca95f0bdd55b66046d.png" alt="my ip advisor"></div><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/71/68/7168c475a6b5f6d2bd5510d4e1c28a72.png" alt="adviser cartographer"></div><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/eb/6d/eb6d060e80736294ea21860a4a818bf3.png" alt="translation advisor"></div><br><br><h4>  Snipples </h4><br>  Snippet (English) - is an excerpt.  In the case of a search, this is an excerpt of text from a website with keywords highlighted in it.  In the case of the Kyuubi, we made additional snippets, which are short labels with maps, giving information about more than 1500 institutions of Belarus.  The places are mostly entertaining, as the Kyuubi gets information about them from the popular site <a href="http://relax.by/">relax.by</a> .  According to statistics, such snippets are clicked twice as often, so the partnership is beneficial for both projects. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/bc/c5/bcc59ddb859e226d3e8e05b5debb80eb.png" alt="snippet moncafe"></div><br><br><h4>  Search by Guest </h4><br>  Probably, many people know that the largest provider in Belarus is Beltelecom and its trademark byfly.  One of the important features of Biflay is that it provides unlimited access to all sites physically located in the Belarusian data center (guest access).  The number of searches on this ‚ÄúInternet on the Internet‚Äù is estimated at 40-50 thousand searches per day, which represents 3-5% of all search traffic in Belarus. <br><br>  Now Kyuubi enters this market as a full-fledged search engine, having the most current and intense index at the moment among all players.  Already at the start of the Kyuubi, there are several thousand guest sites in the database, while the popular search engine now has only a few hundred. <br><br>  From now on, we will develop a search, including a search on Belarus and, in particular, on a guest, as a priority for the Kyuubi.  The emphasis in the development of the service will be placed on maximum convenience and usefulness specifically for Belarusian users. <br><br><h4>  Competition </h4><br>  And finally, I would like to return to my birthday :) Still, the Kyuubi is one year old, and this is a good reason to give presents!  As we know, there are many bloggers or authors writing for a wide variety of sites among Kyuby users, so it was decided to play 15 branded cubicles for the best reviews.  <a href="http://info.qb.by/firstyear">The contest</a> will run until June 10, after which three popular Belarusian bloggers will choose the winners, who will receive cypiparses. <img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/37/5d/375d722646ae4b17c20a7b7c67ae8304.png" alt="kyubikruzhka" align="right"><br><br>  Thanks to everyone who was with the kyuubi this year!  Thanks to habrovchan, so cool to accept our first publication!  Thanks to everyone who stays with us!  Remember, the Kyuubi is always open to new friends. <br><br>  Let's be friends! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/95726/">https://habr.com/ru/post/95726/</a></p>
