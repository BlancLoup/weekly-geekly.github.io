      One of the conditions for the creation of such a site was to spend on all no more than $ 0, or euros, or any other units, in general, do not incur any costs. <br><br>  <b>Therefore, I will need:</b> free hosting, free domain name, free CMS, design and layout of the template for it (I wanted a unique design), free file storage for downloadable content, preferably one that would not require the site user to buy premium accounts or in some other way to spend money on downloading files, and content, thanks to which the site could get to the top search engines. <br><br>  I solved these tasks as they arise :) <br><br>  So, let's begin: <br><br>  <b>Free hosting and domain name</b> <br><br>  The list of free hosters that provide PHP / MySQL and at the same time do not require any advertising is impressive.  Finding a hoster for a small site is not a problem at <a href="http://www.hosting.eu.pn/">once</a> , I was almost settled on <a href="http://www.hosting.eu.pn/">this hoster</a> , but my friends offered me a bit of space on my own, paid hosting - for free, which I used. <br><br>  It was even easier with the domain - regional domain names in Ukraine can be obtained completely free of charge and with automatic extension of the term of delegation (that is, in fact, ‚Äúpermanently‚Äù).  Therefore, I registered the address fallout.km.ua, which I still have never regretted :) <br><br>  <b>CMS and design</b> <br><br>  With the choice of CMS, I didn‚Äôt bother too much, the site will provide text recordings and links to download other materials, so my beloved Drupal will fit completely.  There are many beautiful free templates for Drupal, but I wanted ‚Äúmy own‚Äù, and since I myself am never a designer, this created one of the most difficult problems.  The problem was solved when I found out about the existence of Artisteer - an automatic template generator to the most popular CMS.  Of course, the code that it generates is horror-horror, and the design leaves much to be desired, but it is unique and, in general, quite ‚Äúedible‚Äù. <br><br>  <b>File storage</b> <br><br>  A variety of RapidShare and SendSpace are not suitable because they are paid, and they charge the user for free with advertisements and keep them waiting.  Thanks to the overview on Habr√© of the Wuala system, I knew exactly where I would post my files.  Now all downloadable content lies on the servers of the Wuala system, and it is available for quick free download without registration and advertising via http links. <br><br>  <b>Content</b> <br><br>  About 30% is an honest copy-paste with an indication of the source, the rest is ‚Äúunique content‚Äù, unique from the point of view of search engines.  In fact, this is a translation / rewrite of English-language sites on this topic. <br><br>  <b>SEO</b> <br><br>  As such, not conducted at all.  That is, the text was saturated with keywords extremely intuitively, nothing else was done. <br><br>  <b>And now the results of all this disgrace:</b> <br><br>  The site exists a little more than a month.  Over the past two weeks, he regularly has over 200 unique visits per day and 74 currently registered users. <br><br>  To date, the site hit the top search engine results for such requests: <br><br>  <a href="http://yandex.ru/yandsearch%3Ftext%3DFallout%2520New%2520vegas%26msp%3D1%26lr%3D187">Fallout: New Vegas</a> in Yandex (at the time of this writing - 1st place) <br><br>  <a href="http://yandex.ru/yandsearch%3Ftext%3D%25D0%25A1%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D1%2587%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D1%258C%2BBroken%2BSteel%26stpar2%3D%252Fh0%252Ftm8%252Fs3%26stpar4%3D%252Fs3%26lr%3D187">Download Broken Steel</a> in Yandex (at the time of this writing - 6th place) <br><br>  <a href="http://www.google.com.ua/search%3Fhl%3Dru%26q%3D%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D1%2587%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D1%258C%2BBroken%2BSteel%26btnG%3D%25D0%259F%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%26meta%3D">Download Broken Steel</a> in Google (at the time of this writing - 1st place) <br><br>  <a href="http://yandex.ru/yandsearch%3Ftext%3DFallout%2Bpatch%2B1.5%26stpar2%3D%252Fh1%252Ftm72%252Fs3%26stpar4%3D%252Fs3%26stpar1%3D%252Fu0%26lr%3D187">Fallout patch 1.5</a> in Yandex (at the time of this writing - 2nd place) <br><br>  <a href="http://www.google.com.ua/search%3Fhl%3Dru%26q%3DFallout%2Bpatch%2B1.5%26btnG%3D%25D0%259F%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%26meta%3D">Fallout patch 1.5</a> in Google (at the time of this writing - 1st place) <br><br>  And well looked for a number of other popular queries. <br><br>  <b>Conclusions:</b> to bring the site "to the top" for any popular queries in the subject is quite possible without the involvement of any expensive and cunning SEO mechanisms, but simply saturating it with interesting and necessary content. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/60489/">https://habr.com/ru/post/60489/</a></p>
