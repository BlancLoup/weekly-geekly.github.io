They asked - we answer. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The term <b>‚Äúrefurbished‚Äù</b> (‚Äúrestored‚Äù) is firmly established in the geek vocabulary.  Everyone has heard about the restored technology.  Of course, the discount on the desired electronic device attracts - and it can be from 15 to 50%.  But, although everyone has heard, many have not yet risked buying a ‚Äúrefurbished‚Äù gadget.  Too many questions they cause.  Why such a large scatter of discounts after recovery?  Why so cheap?  And whether the restored device will not disappoint? <br><br>  Questions are legitimate, but the answers are not always obvious.  The algorithm for the appearance of "refurbished" is quite simple: electronics returns to production, undergoes cosmetic and not only procedures, and then goes on sale again.  Here lies the first underwater stone.

      Recovery can be done in two ways: Manufacturer (Factory) Refurbishment and Seller Refurbishment.  Today we will deal with the first category - the most reliable for purchase. <br><br><h3>  Manufacturer (Factory) Refurbishment </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4fb/e8d/4a5/4fbe8d4a5be540459c4768a94e199a37.jpg"><br><br>  This status is received by the technician after ANY return of the equipment to the manufacturer.  Restoration of performance and presentation in this case is made at the manufacturer or official service center.  In this case, the device is subjected to thorough inspection before repair, and after.  To eliminate the drawbacks, official components and appropriate tools are used.  Well, do not forget that the staff of such enterprises is highly qualified. <br><br>  Reasons for this repair: <br><ol><li>  Return after purchase (defect, refund within a specified time) color; </li><li>  Return within the warranty period; </li><li>  Display cases; </li><li>  Damaged packaging; </li><li>  Damage to the device during transportation; </li><li>  Mass defects or the need to upgrade. </li></ol><br>  How to repair? <br><ul><li>  demo samples get fresh packaging and updated case elements; </li><li>  opened and packaged replaced; </li><li>  damaged gadgets are being repaired using original components; </li><li>  The rejected lots go through the procedure of replacing failed units and are brought up to serial, workable modification. </li></ul><br>  After recovery, such devices, in accordance with the American trade regulations, are either stamped on a standard factory package, or are packed in special boxes with the appropriate ‚ÄúRefurbished‚Äù or ‚ÄúRefreshed‚Äù inscriptions.  If the logo is missing - there is a chance of uncertified repair. <br><br><h3>  How not to run into low-quality goods </h3><br>  First of all, it is worth buying equipment only from trusted sellers.  It is worth remembering that the return of the purchased goods after the restoration is possible.  But on average it is no more than 90 days for large trading floors.  Apple offers the possibility of return within 14 days, and Amazon and Sony - 30 days. <br><br>  If a marketplace that is not a direct representative of the company (read ‚Äî an official store such as the Apple Store) does not indicate (or refuses upon request) the possibility of a refund or a guarantee of the purchased goods ‚Äî such a purchase should be abandoned. <br><br><h3>  Where to buy restored equipment manufacturer </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/51a/033/da6/51a033da6f32427bb1d90f23473fb9c7.jpg"><br>  <em>(c) macrumors.com</em> <br><br>  You can purchase reconditioned equipment in most online stores.  Warranty on such equipment is required, as a rule, it is 90 days.  Some official stores and individual brands give a one-year warranty.  But everything is very individual.  Strangely enough, the most stable way to purchase are the official manufacturer's sites.  Their short (and probably incomplete) list with additional conditions: <br><br><ol><li>  <a href="http://www.apple.com/shop/browse/home/specialdeals">Apple stock</a> - one year warranty. </li><li>  <a href="http://www.dell.com/learn/us/en/22/campaigns/outlet">Dell Outlet</a> - one year warranty.  Three categories of goods are offered: ‚Äúnew‚Äù (canceled or returned orders), ‚Äúcertified refurbished‚Äù (restored, verified by the factory Quality Department), and ‚Äúscratch and dent‚Äù (with cosmetic defects). </li><li>  <a href="http://www.hp.com/sbso/buspurchase_refurbished_computing.html">HP</a> - standard unlimited warranty. </li><li>  <a href="https://centresdirect.co.uk/c-66-refurbished.aspx">Sony</a> - 90 days warranty. </li><li>  <a href="http://shop.usa.canon.com/shop/en/catalog/cameras/refurbished-eos-digital-slr-cameras">Canon</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.epson.com/cgi-bin/Store/BuyEpson/ccHome.jsp%3FUseCookie%3Dyes%26ref%3Dcab">Epson</a> - sold as is, without warranty. </li><li>  <a href="https://store.dji.com/refurbished%3Ffrom%3Dstore_index_banner">DJI</a> - 85% of the initial cost, standard warranty, but the exchange is possible only for the restored copies </li><li>  <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/refurbishedpcs/Buy.aspx">Microsoft</a> - a year on the product and 90 days on accessories </li><li>  <a href="http://www.corsair.com/en-us/certified-refurb">Corsair</a> - 1 year warranty </li><li>  <a href="https://gopro.com/site-search%3Fq%3DRefurbished">GoPro - 30 days for money back</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://store.nintendo.com/ng3/browse/category.jsp%3FcategoryId%3Dcat20005%26locale%3D%26categoryPage%3Dtrue">Nintendo</a> </li><li>  <a href="">Nikon</a> </li></ol><br><br>  After getting acquainted with the lots, discounts are evident there - especially in the example of Dell Outlet.  The cost of different copies may vary.  And with enough luck, you can snatch a good complete set of a great laptop for 50-60% of the standard cost. <br><br><h3>  Restored Technology on Amazon </h3><br>  If you don't want to chase ghostly discounts, it's best to use Amazon.  On the site you can always find the main models of popular products in all states: New, Refurbished, Used.  Restored by the manufacturer or the official service of the device on Amazon must be labeled as Certified Refurbished.  In addition, you should not forget about the mandatory guarantee program valid on the site for a period of not less than 90 days. <br><br>  In addition to the main cost reduction due to the ‚ÄúRefurbished‚Äù logo, you can take advantage of additional bonuses and offers in the main American online store.  Some of them can be obtained using the Prime-account.  The easiest way to purchase at a privileged price is to use the ‚Äú <a href="http://pochtoy.com/page/tariffs/">Full support</a> ‚Äù service on <a href="http://pochtoy.com/">Pochtoy.com</a> (you will still use the mail forward service), which we have already <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/pochtoy/blog/279572/">written about</a> in detail. <br><br>  If you want to take advantage of additional discounts yourself, there are several ways to get a Prime account for free.  But about this - in the next article. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/397317/">https://habr.com/ru/post/397317/</a></p>
