  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Frontend Union Conf conference this Saturday</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/578/0e5/318/5780e5318c454fda9941a5b6d78391db" align="left">  Just ten years ago, a significant part of the frontend-development was a layout of photoshop and the fight against cross-browser incompatibility.  It seems that it was yesterday.  And today, the frontend is one of the most dynamically developing areas, in which tools and practices change every six months, and developers still have much to bring about successful approaches and solutions from other areas.  As I have repeatedly <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/mailru/blog/238181/">written</a> , conferences are not a way to learn something new.  This is a way to talk to interesting people on interesting topics.  This Saturday, the FUNC organizers provide a truly unique opportunity to talk with frontend community leaders from different countries.  The conference will be held within the walls of a large event site in the Mail.Ru office, with huge rooms and delicious coffee.  The event plan is under the cut, participation is free, but there are not many registrations left.  Join now! <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h1>  Community Frontend.fi </h1><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f72/61d/b10/f7261db10b3444cfa1dcaa4e319bc31d" align="right">  On behalf of the Frontend.fi community, Varvara Stepanova will talk about the newest approaches to the development of web applications, in which at first individual elements of the interface are created, and then sites and applications are assembled from them.  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa ‚Äúlibrary of ready-made components‚Äù stirs the minds of programmers for more than a dozen years, but only with the advent of Yandex BEM and Facebook React, did this approach finally find an embodiment that the developers liked and allowed creating ‚Äúlive style guides‚Äù. <br><br><h1>  WebNotBombs community </h1><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ba0/bdd/88b/ba0bdd88b6274dd5b22250a38fa66bf4" align="left">  The Minsk community will be represented by two developers at once.  Mikhail Larchenko will talk about the very edge of web technologies - isomorphic React-applications.  Moreover, the report will not be a review, as they love now, but a practical one: Mikhail will share his experience in testing such applications and will gladly discuss the accompanying rakes and mines with you.  Marina Mironovich will also tell about testing, but without React.  But with three stories from personal experience: how to test web applications in real life, what problems they face and what they achieve in the end.  Or do not achieve.  Perhaps it will be three scary stories? <br><br><h1>  BerlinJS community </h1><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/63d/879/6e8/63d8796e883f48fca9ff9e7ce21624a9" align="right">  Jan Monschke, a community representative from Germany, will talk about beer and teamwork.  More precisely, about the development of collaborative applications and the complexity of conflict resolution.  The new DiffSync algorithm will provide an opportunity to smoothly eliminate conflict situations arising from the joint editing of a variety of data.  The module presented by the author will allow you to easily integrate this functionality into the created solutions.

This approach has pros and cons, as well as an interesting scope.  Zarema will share her view of the situation and cases from her own experience. <br><br><h1>  EkbJS Community </h1><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b60/05b/03c/b6005b03cc7647a58d51124418fe9766" align="right">  Yekaterinburg in our get-together will be presented by Sergey Zhigalov, who will talk about Hell.  Ada callback functions, traditionally appearing in asynchronous code at every opportunity.  Sergey will give a historical insight into the origins of asynchronous programming, talk about the evolution of approaches and tools, and also illustrate how the rakes and ways of dealing with them have changed over the years. <br><br><h1>  4Front Community </h1><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/966/603/a9b/966603a9b5f8429780d2b40d65666c4c" align="left">  Vladimir Dashukevich from the 4Front community specially prepared a report on XSS attacks for this event.  The wide spread of cloud technologies every minute prompts dishonest leaders to look for what is bad and has vulnerabilities.  Vladimir will talk about the types of actual attacks, methods of protection and the general state of the industry. <br><br><h1>  Register </h1><br>  There are very few <a href="https://moscowjs.timepad.ru/event/229961/">registrations</a> left for our cool introverts crowd.  In just six days, you will be able to personally communicate with great guys, have a delicious coffee, wander around the Mail.Ru event site and just have a good time.  Guest registration starts at 10:00, and the first speaker will speak at 11:00.  See you this Saturday! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/265293/">https://habr.com/ru/post/265293/</a></p>
