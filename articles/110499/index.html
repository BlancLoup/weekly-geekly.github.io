    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Order </h4><br> <code>timestamp: 14.12.2010 13:15</code> <br>  I found the position I needed on the site and contacted the ICQ manager to clarify the availability of this mozheli in stock. <br>  The manager confirmed that the goods are there and I can safely place an order and he will definitely get to NG before me. <br>  So I did.  I filled in the required fields on the order form and after 5 minutes received a letter from the manager: <br><blockquote>  Hello! <br><br>  We work with the regions only on 100% prepayment. <br><br>  Payment of the goods ordered by you is possible only by bank transfer, both from a legal entity and from an individual. <br><br>  When ordering for a private person, payment is possible through electronic payment systems Yandex-Money, WebMoney;  In this payment amount is: the cost of goods + shipping + 1% commission. <br>  <u>When paying by money transfer to our employee</u> (Western Union, Sberbank, etc.) the amount of payment is: the cost of goods + shipping. <br>  We can also issue an invoice from our organization for payment through Sberbank or another bank, in this case the amount of payment is: the cost of the goods + shipping + 5% fee for non-cash payments. <br>  Return letter you need to confirm the selected payment system <br></blockquote><br><br><h4>  I want to be better ... </h4><br>  Money transfer to the employee - an interesting and fast option.  No need to wait a few days until the money reach the standard bank transfer. <br>  Here is such a <s>concern for customers a</s> banal tax evasion scheme. <br>  Well, not a problem.  Translation so translation.  Remembering that last time everything was fine, I received payment details and went to the bank. <br>  Having spent ~ 2 hours waiting for the transaction to be completed at the savings bank (yes, the blitz is accepted in any window without a queue, but that doesn‚Äôt mean that you don‚Äôt have to wait for their wonderful, reliable banking software to hang) I immediately wrote a letter indicating the control number transfer to the store. <br> <code>timestamp: 14.12.2010 16:30</code> <br>  Naturally, I was not surprised that an employee could not receive a transfer on the same day.  Moscow, snow, bad weather, traffic jams, well, or whatever else you can think of. <br><br><h4>  ... it turns out as always </h4><br> <code>timestamp: 16.12.2010 12:12</code> <br>  After several letters asking me to clarify the status of the order, I kicked the manager in ICQ and I was finally answered: <br><blockquote>  Good day! <br>  Today we have withdrawn money for your order.  Item reserved in stock.  I ship tomorrow. <br></blockquote><br>  There is no hurry, I thought.  To ng 2 weeks. <br>  And, just in case, I asked to send the parcel number for tracking upon shipment. <br><br><h4>  The obvious is incredible </h4><br> <code>timestamp: 20.12.2010 10:00</code> <br>  Repeatedly writing a letter asking for clarification of the departure number, I again kicked the manager in ICQ. <br>  Request sent, wait - he told me. <br>  After 30 minutes, the girl called me back and said the following: <br>  On the day of your order, in the evening, a wholesaler arrived and took away all the iPads. <br>  The new party came today, but more expensive. <br>  Since we are a decent company, we will sell it for you at no extra charge if you pay only 2,200 rubles. <br><br><h4>  No exit </h4><br>  I rejected the offer to return the money, imagining how difficult it would look. <br>  Yes, and ordering a gift elsewhere, due to their acute shortage, it was too late. <br>  Realizing that 2,200 rubles is not money, I went to the bank in an already familiar, electronic queue. <br><br>  On the phone, I clarified whether a reserve was made for my order from the current availability, due to the payment of most of the cost of the goods. <br>  The girl promised to clarify and later sent a letter: <br>  There is a reserve, I have it already brought from the warehouse to the office. <br><br><h4>  So what is next? </h4><br> <code>timestamp: 22.12.2010 13:40</code> <br>  Yesterday I received a letter saying that the extra payment for the order had not yet been received, since ‚Äútraffic jams, snow, natural disasters and UFOs‚Äù, but in the evening they should definitely have the money. <br>  Since then, I have not received any replies to the letters. <br>  A consultant in ICQ promises to clarify the status of the order. <br><br>  Just called the store. <br>  I was informed that the goods order was sent yesterday at 20.00, but, to their greatest regret, the courier order service!  got lost! .. <br>  According to the invoice number in tracking, of course, quite left information comes out. <br>  Now we will fight with the refund. <br><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4><br>  And which of all this can be concluded? <br>  Do not order online?  It is extremely difficult to find, for us, the distant future, to find in stock a good, high-quality and most importantly - the desired gadget. <br>  Do not trust online shopping?  But for the first time everything was fine.  and figure it out now - lucky for the first time or really unlucky for the second? <br><br>  Of course, mobilmax, they behave a <s>little more than completely unprofessionally</s> like goner freaks! <br>  Contact numbers, emails, etc.  they have.  All questions could be resolved within 1-2 days. <br><br>  But you,% username%, think carefully about whether to trust the store, which, a little more than completely, screwed up in one of two cases. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/110499/">https://habr.com/ru/post/110499/</a></p>
