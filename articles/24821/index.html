Afterword to Web 2.0 Expo-2008</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  It seems, indeed, Web 2.0 has died or, in any case, is in a death state.  Do not be scared, AJAX and other rich and "poor", so-called, web-dance technologies continue to successfully develop and be used.  FaceBook, MySpace and others like them did not go bankrupt and do not even think about such a bitter fate.  SaaS, although it went ‚Äú <a href="http://www.itechbridge.com/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D91771">into the clouds,</a> ‚Äù continues its victorious march across the planet. <br><br>  <em>The full text of the original notes can be found in <a href="http://www.itechbridge.com/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D95044">my blog</a> .</em>  <em>Well, and fans of express information are offered its abbreviated edition ...</em> <em><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/fb6/c26/87e/fb6c2687eb3a7924493edc57d934202c.jpg" width="150" height="88" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left"></em> <br>  What happened was what the opportunists and their obedient servant joined them for so long.  After all, starting with his ‚Äú <a href="http://www.itechbridge.com/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D5821">O'Reilly, you're wrong</a> ‚Äù and ending with ‚Äú <a href="http://www.itechbridge.com/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D91935">Three, two, or ... until one?</a>  ‚Äù(From a series of sketches of‚Äú Internet at the crossing ‚Äù), I, alas, did not very successfully try to show everyone that Web 2.0 is nothing more than a marketing marketing tool.  Labels, hung on the whole amount of new, rather heterogeneous services, technologies and, maybe, design solutions that came to the Internet in the era of its Renaissance after the first economic collapse. <br><br>  And now, speaking in San Francisco at the annual conference Web 2.0 Expo-2008, O'Reilly, the author of this clearly spectacular term, essentially <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DCQibri7gpLM%26feature%3Drelated">agreed</a> with all opportunists.  Moreover, from his plenary speech should not expect in the near future the coming of the next messiah called Web 3.0, but there will be a gradual development of everything accumulated on the Internet, including, of course, what is going on under the Web 2.0 brand.

      The Internet is not nuclear physics, where one cannot see without a fundamental preliminary scientific study of a nuclear power plant and other good and not so good projects.  The Internet is, first of all, engineering technologies, in the development of which the principle ‚ÄúFirst was the case‚Äù.  And only then, when this very "case" has come true, the turn of the "word" comes - the comprehension of what has been done, the development of the terminological apparatus and other scientific and methodological processes.  The fact of accomplishment is determined only by His Majesty the Market. <br><br>  Purely a coincidence that I finished my <a href="http://www.itechbridge.com/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D91935">last sketch</a> for the sketch of the painting ‚ÄúInternet at the Crossing‚Äù a few days before the start of ‚ÄúWeb 2.0 Expo-2008‚Äù.  Therefore, I was very pleased that the main considerations expressed in my ‚ÄúPicture‚Äù almost completely coincided with the conclusions of this conference.  And even the name "Pictures" echoes the characteristics of today's Internet, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/7368387.stm">given</a> at the Mitchil Baker conference, the chairman of the board of directors of Mozzilla Corp, who said that the Internet is now "at a crossroads." <br><br>  I confess that I was not at the conference itself.  Read the <a href="http://el-ave.habrahabr.ru/blog/40719.html">note</a> published in Habr√© by one of the participants of this conference, and you will understand that this was not so obligatory.  Why do we go to such events?  Basically, to show yourself and others to see.  But if such a ‚Äúmarketing‚Äù task is not set before you, then in order to conceptually feel the essence of the event, it is much more useful to carefully read, compare and try to summarize its materials along with the conclusions of individual participants.  With the advent of the Internet for myself, I have long decided that this approach is more often more productive.  As the poet said, ‚Äúthe big is seen at a distance‚Äù :). <br><br>  What are the main conclusions I made, and this time acting in this way?  It is known that everyone hears what he wants to hear.  Naturally, I am not an exception to this rule.  Therefore, I fully admit that the <a href="http://www.itechbridge.com/forum/index.php%3Fshowforum%3D681">selection of materials</a> on which I relied will seem very subjective to someone.  But, nevertheless, here they are, my five main conclusions: <br><br>  1. If earlier, when speaking about the growing up of the social web, they meant, first of all, its audience and tools, now they are talking about players in this market.  And the figures here are becoming more and more significant.  IBM, the IT market patriarch, who presented the iDataPlex hardware and software server at the conference, is beginning to play an increasingly prominent role in the company of such giants as Google, Yahoo, Microsoft, Cisco. <br><br>  2. More and more experts are inclined to believe that a real revolution on the Internet, which is still very far away, will occur only with the implementation of the concept of the Semantic Web.  Well, for now, as an evolutionary substitution of the Semantic Web, in the near future, the conference was called ‚Äúharness collective intelligence‚Äù, or simply ‚Äúsocial intelligence.‚Äù <br>  3. Despite the expected next economic crisis, the flow of investments in social networking resources will not only not decrease, but will even increase over the next five years.  However, this stream will be directed primarily to the business application of the Internet, or Enterprise 2.0. <br><br>  4. Live Mesh, presented at the conference by Microsoft, means for remote storage of files and synchronized work with them, finally convinced all doubters not only that Microsoft seriously came to the Internet, but also that the business application of the Internet clearly goes to the clouds (cloud computing). <br>  5. You can use whatever you like for the name of this direction (web as platform, PaaS, SaaS, Web 2.5, WebOS), but the fact that Platforms-as-Service signifies another step in transferring the functions of traditional operating systems to networked ones. resources, now there is no doubt even among the most complete skeptics. <br><br>  <em>I remind you that you can learn more about these findings, as well as with the note, in general, in my <a href="http://www.itechbridge.com/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D95044">iTech Bridge - blog</a> .</em> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/24821/">https://habr.com/ru/post/24821/</a></p>
