It is enough for them to write how everything should work well, and then not their problems. <br><br>  Something like this turned out to be ‚Äúhow the dialogues should work,‚Äù or rather the ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù modal dialogues from the point of view of a11y. <br><br>  In the description of the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Techniques/Using_the_dialog_role">dialog role on MDN,</a> everything is written very simply: 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
    <ul><li>  The dialog must be properly labeled </li><li>  Keyboard focus must be managed correctly </li></ul><br>  The problem is that MDN has forgotten about another important point, and the rest have forgotten one of the things they said - that the modal should not let the focus out of its hands.  The active element must be put under lock.  Do not let him escape from our trap. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/024/a8b/837/024a8b837d134f8ca9103d4649181657.jpeg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Modal dialog </h2><br>  The story began quite recently - in the Web Standards Newsletter I got a link to the ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù <a href="http://davidtheclark.github.io/react-aria-modal/demo/">WAI-ARIA Dialog</a> .  And away we go. <br><br>  The component is really good: <br><br><ul><li>  it hangs aria-hidden on the page to hide content from screen-readers (works only in the first example). </li><li>  it obscures the content and cuts down the scrolling page. </li><li>  controls the focus so that the modal cannot be tabooed. </li><li>  after closing the dialog, it returns focus to the original position. </li><li>  and adds different aria-specific tags, of course. </li></ul><br>  Those he does everything that asks for MDN and even more, since without the first item to ‚Äúget out‚Äù of the dialogue with the activated screen reader it is not difficult. <br><br>  In general - must have! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/452/bc6/aae/452bc6aaea954db3aa0a959e239076e2.gif"><br><br><h3>  Focus </h3><br>  But the implementation of " <a href="https://github.com/davidtheclark/focus-trap">focus-management</a> " is a little disappointing - the guys actually intercept keyboard events (and not only) and <u>emulate the</u> tab button themselves. <br><br>  It is so incomprehensible to the mind that I decided to dig a little as ‚Äúthis‚Äù should work at all.  The word "dig" means to check how different sites and frameworks handle tabs. <br><br>  Let's start with the sites (a bit biased sample): <br><br><ul><li>  Google Gmail | G + - perfect.  Ô∏è </li><li>  Classmates - with the departure of taba they close the modal, to which the focus never comes </li><li>  FB - depends on the page.  In the group / on the personal page - there is nothing, at the time of writing messages is.  Never zhmakayte Tab (in safari) on the main - the roof blows. </li><li>  VK - ‚Äúrandomly‚Äù page ignores tab </li><li>  Yandex.Maps - the page completely ignores the tab </li><li>  Yandex.Music - the page completely ignores the tab </li><li>  YAN - no focus management. </li><li>  LiveJournal - no focus management. </li><li>  My own sites - no focus management. </li><li>  Habrahabr - no focus management, modals </li><li>  Jira / Confluence - perfect.  Ô∏è </li></ul><br>  The conclusion is simple - the ‚Äúnormal‚Äù sites lack a bit of brains, and Yandex's hands are torn off. <br><br>  With frameworks (a bit biased sample) is much more interesting: <br><br><ul><li>  jQuery UI - by focusIn outside the modal, hangs the focus back in a certain order.  There is a selector for tabbable and focusable.  Works on an honest word, but well - <a href="">github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/widgets/dialog.js#L300</a> </li><li>  Ant.Design - actually uses rc-dialog for this business, which hangs up the hend only on the Tab.  Through shift + tab you can go back. <br><br>  And in general, this is the most crooked code of all presented here, it‚Äôs even unpleasant to give a link - <a href="">github.com/react-component/dialog/blob/master/src/Dialog.tsx#L133</a> </li><li>  BluePrint.js - A VERY well customizable Modal is able, including the enforceFocus property for this business.  One is bad - it works only for autoFocus fields, and fields with a given tabIndex.  What were they thinking about?  - <a href="">github.com/palantir/blueprint/blob/master/packages/core/src/components/overlay/overlay.tsx#L312</a> </li><li>  Bootstrap?  Throws a focus on himself.  Shift + Tab rests on the beginning and gets stuck - <a href="">github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/900da3e235305c2daefe86c0a960e36be6e1b60b/js/src/modal.js#L280</a> </li><li>  The AUI - the only framework that has a dedicated class for focus-manger and general working "correctly" - on focusOut and event.relatedTaget - <a href="">bitbucket.org/atlassian/aui/src/92b8ce839ef1b6f320fe6a590def1cbc40cd2724/src/js/aui/focus-manager.js</a> </li><li>  Atlaskit, RamblerUI, MaterialUI and even Semantic-UI (+ React version) - no hint of focus management. <br></li></ul><br>  With frameworks it appears too absolutely bad.  And absolutely no one, no one hangs aria-hidden on the rest of the content to make the modal <b>really accessible</b> to people who are forced to use screen readers. <br><br><h3>  Oftopik </h3><br>  In fact, I also didn‚Äôt bother at all with all this garbage, but then, as an evil, my dear wife decided to learn how to design in the HTML Academy where <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/pepelsbey/" class="user_link">pepelsbey</a> with a big, big company made her and me think about the question of how <i>tabby</i> my site is. <br><br>  I had to learn a new science and solve a problem with a focus. <br><br><blockquote>  PS: Vadim recommends scoring on all this aria-hidden with focus-management and using the html <b>inert</b> attribute, which simply ‚Äúturns off‚Äù (just completely) everything except the modal and there will be no problems with either the screen / reader or the focus. <br><br>  Although I‚Äôm not sure about the second one, it‚Äôs still not working very well, and the polyfiles are terrifying ..... </blockquote><br><h2>  Focus lock </h2><br>  In general, as Leo Tolstoy said on the street ... - <i>and what are your suggestions</i> ? <br><br>  In fact, the problem is very simple - despite the fact that millions of modules were written for JS - there are actually no modules for focus management. <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://github.com/IsaacAndela/focus-manager">focus-manager</a> is a simple focus-manager with a simple vanilla API and a <a href="http://isaacandela.github.io/focus-manager/">great example</a> .  There are a couple of minuses </li><li>  <a href="https://github.com/tolemac/ToleFocus">ToleFocus</a> is some kind of monster from which you want to run. </li><li>  <a href="https://github.com/vigetlabs/react-focus-trap">react-focus-trap</a> is so simple that it returns focus only to the beginning. </li><li>  Focus manager from AUI, but who had heard about <a href="https://docs.atlassian.com/aui/">AUI</a> before? </li><li>  <a href="https://github.com/davidtheclark/focus-trap">focus-trap</a> , which is also focus-trap-react, which was used in the WAI-ARIA demo at the beginning of the article.  And which is turned off by default by Esc and generally does not use the DOM-API correctly </li></ul><br>  In general, <i>7 troubles = +1 new bike</i> .  Or rather a real train from <a href="https://github.com/theKashey/focus-lock">focus-lock</a> , <a href="https://github.com/theKashey/dom-focus-lock">dom-focus-lock</a> , <a href="https://github.com/theKashey/react-focus-lock">react-focus-lock</a> and <a href="https://github.com/theKashey/vue-focus-lock">vue-focus-lock</a> - for all occasions. <br><br>  From the side of the wrapper (react, vue, dom), everything is very simple - get the DOM node and close the focus in it.  All salt in focus-lock. <br><br>  There are several reasons for creating a new library: <br><br><ul><li>  Unfortunately, all solutions (except focus-trap / lock) completely ignore tabIndex and become completely inoperable if one smart programmer breaks the tab order. <br>  The case, of course, is a bit synthetic, but quite real.  To my great regret. </li><li>  Of all the solutions (except focus-trap / lock and react-focus-trap), you can easily tabulate the safari (JFYI: safari distinguishes between Tab and Opt + Tab).  And if the focus leaves the trap once, no one will return it back. <br></li><li>  focus-trap, which works so well everywhere, does it because it intercepts and emulates a Tab, which completely ignores the settings of the same Safari with the item above. <br></li><li>  All solutions (except focus-lock and BluePrint.js) select the first element at the input, not the autofocus element. <br>  PS: focus-trap is looking for an element with an initialFocus attribute.  Why? <br></li></ul><br>  So I had to make another bike, which temporarily responds to a slightly larger list of whistles than its closest competitors.  Or specifically to all. <br><br>  Just wrap modals (and not only modals) in FocusLock - and half of the problems will be solved. <br>  React-focus-lock <a href="https://codesandbox.io/s/jvl0k6zyk3">demo</a> - <a href="https://codesandbox.io/s/jvl0k6zyk3">codesandbox.io/s/jvl0k6zyk3</a> ( <a href="https://codesandbox.io/s/jllj5kr6ov">find the difference</a> ). <br>  Vue-focus-lock <a href="https://codesandbox.io/s/l5qlpxqvnq">demo</a> - <a href="https://codesandbox.io/s/l5qlpxqvnq">codesandbox.io/s/l5qlpxqvnq</a> <br><br><pre><code class="javascript hljs">&lt;FocusLock&gt; <span class="xml"><span class="hljs-tag"><span class="xml"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;</span></span><span class="hljs-name"><span class="xml"><span class="hljs-tag"><span class="hljs-name">Modal</span></span></span></span><span class="xml"><span class="hljs-tag">&gt;</span></span></span><span class="xml"> any data </span><span class="hljs-tag"><span class="xml"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/</span></span><span class="hljs-name"><span class="xml"><span class="hljs-tag"><span class="hljs-name">Modal</span></span></span></span><span class="xml"><span class="hljs-tag">&gt;</span></span></span></span> &lt;<span class="hljs-regexp"><span class="hljs-regexp">/FocusLock&gt;</span></span></code> </pre> <br>  But only half, since aria-hidden (or inert) will have to be hung up by someone else and somewhere else.  But that's another story. <br><br><h2>  Total </h2><br>  Total do not forget% username%, that modals are not only a gray lightbox, which is not clicked by the mouse, but also a wondrous world of keyboard exercises. <br><br>  But most importantly - do not forget that you should not interfere with the user to operate with the site not only with the mouse. <br><br><blockquote>  PS: Better yet, turn on VoiceOver or another ScreenReader and try your sites for durability.  Be surprised. <br>  Many things, for example, ‚Äúmanual keyboard navigation‚Äù in Yandex Mail, defacto does not change the active element. <br>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/336600/">One programmer from Finland</a> Yandex just lost as a user. <br><br>  PPS: Gmail, however, is not so much better. </blockquote><br><br>  In general - do not get caught - <a href="https://github.com/theKashey/react-focus-lock">github.com/theKashey/react-focus-lock</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/338130/">https://habr.com/ru/post/338130/</a></p>
