    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <i>Wikipedia</i> <br><br><blockquote>  Internet marketing (eng. Internet marketing) is the practice of using all aspects of traditional marketing on the Internet, affecting the main elements of the marketing mix: price, product, point of sale and promotion.  The main goal is to get the maximum effect from the potential audience of the site. </blockquote><br><br>  From this rather simple description of a concept, one can see a rather complicated concept of an effective strategy for any site. <br><br>  But let's move consistently. <br><br>  <b>Aspects of traditional online marketing</b> <br><br>  Any aspect of anything is just a part of something bigger.  Aspects of marketing can be called its tools - contextual advertising, search engine promotion, banners, articles in the media.  And that will be the right answer.  However, if we speak or want to derive an effective basic strategy for any project, then this answer is not correct. <br><br>  <b>The choice of tools strongly depends on the specific goals</b> of a project.  Although, you will say that the goals are always the same - to earn.  But alas, I have not met a single successful businessman who would have become rich in pursuing a similar goal. <br><br>  Consider examples: <br><br>  Website booking airline tickets publishing low-cost, goal: to form a convenient search for cheap tickets. <br><br>  Website booking accommodation in different countries, the goal - to create a convenient database for housing search. <br>  - Website promotion services (or creation), purpose -?  try to identify yourself. <br><br>  <b>Why is goal important for internet marketing?</b> <br><br>  In my opinion, the question of saving the budget and search is not the traffic to the site, but directly potentially interested customers. <br><br>  Is everything logical yet? <br><br>  <b>How to set a goal?</b> <br><br>  While preparing the material for the launch of the advertising <a href="https://andrew-e.com/seo-faq/seo-obuchenie-poiskovomu-marketingu-v-izraile/">campaign on search marketing</a> , on facebook, I began to set a goal - to search for interested students who are willing to learn, as well as pay for this training.  But when setting up targeting, I realized that my goal is not correct, and that means that the whole strategy of future advertising can either fail or become much more expensive than the planned budget. <br>  So what is the actual error?  At first glance, I am really looking for solvent students.  (by the way, a week of advertising with a similar goal gave 0.0006% conversion). <br><br>  But if you try to look into the heads of these people, you can make sure that they are all different and have different goals, and that means my goal, you should begin to resonate with them in order to gain effectiveness. <br><br>  Is nothing clear yet? <br><br>  Example 1 <br>  Imagine Vasya, who really wants to get a new profession and is focused on the goal of increasing his own earnings.  He doesn‚Äôt know what internet marketing is and, honestly, he doesn‚Äôt care - his desire to get rich. <br>  Such Vasya sees an advertisement - a course on search marketing in Israel.  And it does not catch him.  Because, in fact, he does not want to learn - he wants to get rich. <br><br>  It is clear that Vasya may have forgotten to explain that he is in the span without learning skills, but this is not important yet. <br>  We generate an ad for Vasi - Course on search marketing in Israel.  At the end of the course, you will learn how to earn your first 100,000. <br><br>  After the transition of such a user, like our Vasya, he will have to explain that you can‚Äôt easily catch a fish ... <s>but these are</s> no <s>details</s> , this is the most important part. <br><br>  Vasya has yet to motivate to learn, using his motivations that change as a result. <br><br>  Example 2 <br>  Let us imagine Vasya, from a parallel reality, who has goals to learn how to promote websites, his own or others, is not important.  For him, the main motivation will be the knowledge that he can get. <br><br>  Our ad with the mention of the alleged earnings will not work for him completely and will be perceived as another scam.  Why?  It's simple, a person who is looking for knowledge, most likely often uses a search engine for this and the likelihood that he attended courses that did not give him anything or did not correspond to the stated goal is quite large.  According to this announcement with the mention of possible earnings will be perceived negatively on a subconscious level. <br><br>  Then we have a dilemma, how to set up an ad so that it would be perceived as normal by both Vasya? <br>  Answers, you can write in the comments. <br><br>  I can say that solving this problem, I received more than 30 responses in 1 evening.  And gathered several groups for the course.  About this in the next article in the form of a case. <br><br>  And so, the correctness of the goal greatly affects the result of your advertising.  As you can see from the examples with the wrong purpose, I was looking for clients spending a week on advertising, with the right one - I found it in the evening. <br><br>  What is this all about? <br><br>  In addition, internet marketing is not a tool in itself.  It is the collection of tools that you have chosen to achieve your goal.  Therefore, it is worth starting with the goal and studying potential goals of your potential customers, only then approach the construction of a promotion or promotion strategy. <br><br>  I wrote about the course in my blog: andrew-e.com, under which I developed a separate landing page on logic, which I will write in one of the following articles. <br><br>  Thank you for your attention and productive promotion of your projects. <br>  I would be grateful for your opinion in the comments. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/296076/">https://habr.com/ru/post/296076/</a></p>
