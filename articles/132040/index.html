  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Cosmopoly IT world after the crisis</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The world of information technology, and after them the material one, is divided into two parts. <br><br>  The first is a database.  People work with different programs and each of them keeps with them around the base.  This is preached by both local applications and sites. <br><br>  This is how millions of informational segments are formed.  The advantage is simplicity: such databases are not difficult to pre-configure to work with a specific subject area.  A certain template is created by which further information is simply simply thrown in and processed. 
      <br>

      There are two downsides: <br><br>  1. the division into bases does not allow to establish all the relationships between the data and, accordingly, it does not squeeze all the benefits out of them. <br>  2. A program that has gained control over any data has no interest to be further optimized in relation to them, using its monopoly position. <br><br>  But there is also a super-minus, money: the seller and the buyer are face to face, one on one.  And if the sale of other services has a dispute over the price regarding the material values ‚Äã‚Äãspent (time of the master, the price of raw materials, etc.), then in the case of trading programs this support is practically absent.  A clash turns into a cruel bargaining where there are no winners. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  As a result, all this leads to general displeasure: the lack of desire of programmers to work with the soul and under-automation of farms.  Completes the problem that people find complete pleasure in avoiding reality thanks to the same information technologies: games, TV shows, social networks, etc.  The farms also find a bad way out and also with the use of IT: it becomes profitable not to produce, but to cheat those who still produce by taking away their profits (see high-frequency traders). <br><br>  Naturally, with such rending contradictions, this part of the world has the only finish - a collapse, an ever-expanding crisis.  We observe it.  The world of local databases is programmed to self-destruct.  In principle, this world and without a financial crisis would self-destruct because of environmental or resource apocalypses (it was just as predetermined by itself), but it just does not even have to wait. <br><br>  One way or another, the death of one usually means the birth of another.  The collapse of the first part of the IT world gives a good chance of the second.  The name of this alternate reality is cosmopoly (cosmo). <br><br><h5>  World </h5><br>  Cosmopoly - an alternative view on the IT-sphere and the whole world.  Here all the information is one and only one database - the knowledge base.  Those.  a computer program can write its information into the database and any other one can use this record without any problems.  Naturally, sample administration is no longer possible here.  The data are pure from any other meanings, i.e.  are on the same plane, equally accessible to any processing program. <br><br>  This requirement produces an important transformation with information: it is atomized.  If the interaction is unpredictable from all sides, then it is easiest for any object to take an economical form and decrease to the minimum possible size - to become like an atom.  Fortunately for information this is possible thanks to the so-called.  <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2594%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BF%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0">descriptive logic</a> . <br><br>  Accordingly, the database becomes just an array of cells for atoms of information.  Each such cell supports an unlimited number of write / destroy atoms cycles.  At the same time, in the course of filling the cells, they are re-switched (linked) to each other. <br><br>  Changes in the database device affect processing programs.  It‚Äôs more difficult for them to work, because even here you don‚Äôt apply templates.  AI (artificial intelligence) inevitably enters into the matter.  Programs turn into reasoning algorithms - reasoners.  Or simply - <i>cartoons</i> .  Everything changes.  At the output of the cartoons, it‚Äôs not so much new data as a certain form of life, a creative product.  They themselves begin to look more like biological cells. <br><br>  And most importantly, now there is no monopoly.  For the right to control any data cartoons compete fiercely and every second.  For the first time in the history of intelligent life, artificial cultivation of effort and soul arises.  Previously, the latter were possible additions, now constitute the main requirement.  This is the main essence and content of cosmopoly as a world. <br><br>  The result of this approach should be widespread robotization. <br><br>  Today, robots totally lose on the effectiveness of people.  Any East Asian worker is more productive and more convenient than the most advanced of the current machines.  Their efficiency is not comparable.  The only reason for the presence of robotic lines in such conditions is the temporary military-financial gains of a number of developed countries, allowing their citizens to generously repay deliverance from physical labor. <br><br>  In cosmopoly, robots have every chance of becoming more efficient than humans thanks to advanced AI.  Cartoons are - robots.  Possessing intelligence, they will be able to create other robots themselves and determine demand in the economy themselves.  At the same time, people can simply occupy command positions while living on interest from a fully robotic farm. <br><br>  All this determines the appearance of the world after the crisis.  So we go on a long sustainable development.  The power of civilization increases by orders of magnitude. <br><br><h5>  System </h5><br>  For a new reality, you just need to find a source of funding.  After all, the old disappeared with the old economy and the world (in fact, they were the cause of their collapse).  And the solution to this issue is present in cosmopolis just as naturally as everything else: you need to attach money to the system itself, to make it your part. <br><br>  The main focus is on share premium, i.e.  on the proceeds from the sale of currency.  Now all this income goes to support the national economy of the United States.  In the conditions of a financial (final) crisis, this means that it is being wasted.  Cosmopoly unhooks this power from the United States and draws to itself, or rather directly to the financing of cartoons. <br><br>  To implement this plan, the system issues its currency.  The cosmopolitan money becomes the very cells of the knowledge base where you can put atoms of meaning.  The conditional name - ruby ‚Äã‚Äãor rupi.  A client who wants to use multi buys a group of rubles, forming a springboard for the activities of the programs.  This creates a market demand for rubies.  Cosmopoly satisfies this demand and divides the proceeds between all the rubles issued by that time, forming dividends by one monetary unit (in this case the rubies are similar to stocks). <br><br>  Then everything is simple.  If the rub is not filled with an atom, then the dividend is sent to the owner of the rub.  Otherwise, he falls into the hands of cartoon.  Financing is made. <br><br><h5>  Company </h5><br>  The rubies are issued and maintained by the organization of the same name accounting system - the cosmopolitan.  This is a special bank.  The basic functionality of cosmo is to ensure the issue and stability of the currency, as well as customer support.  The bank's income is generated by withdrawing interest on the transfer of rubles from client to client. <br><br>  A bank can attract investments for its development through its own currency.  There may be a non-profit organization. <br><br><h5>  Universe </h5><br>  We, the people, are facing ambitious goals: a full-fledged space exploration and an attempt to artificially generate worlds (see Yury Nikolayevich Efremov‚Äôs article " <a href="http://bit.ly/fM058P">Pseudoscience and Hypothesis</a> ").  It is obvious that in the framework of the old world we will not achieve these goals.  It is necessary to step over the current difficulties and get out of them completely different, incomparably more powerful and energetic.  This is a political question of our human greatness. <br><br>  For cosmo!  For us! <br><br>  (it turned out to be such a draft of the manifesto of AI-shnikov, semantics, cosmists, scientists and other unfortunate :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/132040/">https://habr.com/ru/post/132040/</a></p>
