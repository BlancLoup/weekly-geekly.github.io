For some reason, many managers underestimate this aspect of project life and prefer, instead of their clients, to listen to reputable people from various areas. <br><br>  Some manage to go round almost all start-up parties and ask their opinion on all the reputable experts that they could find.  But you know, it will give nothing.  But only takes precious time and money to move.  And that's why. <br><a name="habracut"></a>

    <h4>  Clients are "more expert" experts </h4><br>  In fact, the most reputable experts are your first users.  It is they, not the mentors and mega-experts, who will tell you where the layout has moved out and where some function does not work.  They really try your product and express their opinion about it from the inside, not from the outside.  And experts see only the tip of the iceberg, the wrapper of the project.  Clients see the entire iceberg as a whole and evaluate the internal content.  That is why their opinion is much more important. <br><br>  <b>That clients are able to offer really useful ideas for the development of functionality.</b>  <b>Because they already use the product and they know better what they are ready to pay for!</b> <br><br>  Two experts can say absolutely different things to you.  Because in fact, none of them know your product as deeply as customers.  The opinion of experts is divorced from reality, even despite their rich experience in a particular area.  The opinion of clients, on the contrary, is the most objective.  And how you listen to him depends on your profit and the success of the project as a whole. <br><br><h4>  While the rest "hang out", we do </h4><br>  Instead of start-up parties and hunting for opinions, we are simply working with the team on the development of the company and sensitively listening to our users, trying not to miss a single response from them.  It is feedback from users that best helps us in development.  The path of development and priorities are arranged by themselves.  Errors and omissions also quickly make themselves felt.  And all this, in general, for free.  And do not need to go anywhere.  And the time saved goes to useful work. <br><br><h4>  Looking for the perfect feedback tool ... </h4><br>  In general, we realized the importance of feedback long ago when we were working on our first web projects.  One of them was a novelty on the market, and there was a particular need for some feedback and user interaction tool.  But it turned out that there is nothing particularly useful on this market in this area ... In addition to a dozen completely identical side buttons ‚ÄúFeedback‚Äù for the site, the benefits from which almost did not turn out. <br><br>  It made us think and speculate, and what tool for user interaction do we want?  Many interesting ideas and solutions came to mind.  Then it was decided to make your project in the field of feedback. <br><br><h4>  Support yourself like! </h4><br>  The tool we created now helps us, as well as our first users.  And just the other day, we also got the idea to support start-up entrepreneurs, giving each of them $ 100 to use all the possibilities of the service we created.  This is quite enough for any team for the period until the project goes to the first profit or looking for investment. <br><br>  We decided that such an action would help business newcomers to become aware of all the benefits of feedback and focus on their customers, and not on alien opinions.  No matter how authoritative they are.  Such an approach will provide the project with a greater chance of success and help to gently overcome the most difficult initial period. <br><br>  <b>The page of our action <a href="http://uppza.com/promo">here</a> .</b>  We will be happy to help everyone who really needs it.  And maybe we can even make the market a little more pleasant for customers.  At least we will try! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/151235/">https://habr.com/ru/post/151235/</a></p>
