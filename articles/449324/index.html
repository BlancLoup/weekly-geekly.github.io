What to expect from the reports this time?  Under the cut, we walked through many of them, highlighting general trends. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Keynouts </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/7o/lj/si/7oljsivsolanm4wmgsomlwwbxrs.jpeg">

      Among the reports, keynotes are the most noticeable, which tear off or close the day.  There are no hardcore or highly specialized themes in them (because viewers with different backgrounds are sitting in the hall).  But there is a place for unusual ideas, and the usual picture of the world can be served from a new perspective. <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Ivan Yamshchikov</b> is known to many, but mostly not in the world of testing.  Combining ABBYY‚Äôs work and research at the Max Planck Institute in Leipzig, he is interested in the creative potential of neural networks (you could hear his project ‚ÄúNeural Defense‚Äù) and the work of the human brain.  At the conference, he <a href="https://heisenbug-piter.ru/2019/spb/talks/4hv4vytf1upgkecqyebmbw/">will come up</a> with the topic <b>‚ÄúWhat is common between testing and data analysis,‚Äù</b> presenting a look from an unexpected side. </li><li>  Another speaker from the ‚Äúneighboring area‚Äù is <b>Neil Ford</b> (ThoughtWorks).  Neil specializes in architectural issues.  At Heisenbug, he will <a href="https://heisenbug-piter.ru/2019/spb/talks/5bp2z7mmi4wutjtvsrgwo6/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3D449324">talk</a> about an <b>‚Äúevolutionary architecture‚Äù</b> that can adapt to changing circumstances.  But this does not mean that the word "testing" will not sound at all: we remember what the conference is dedicated to.  By the way, we previously <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/jugru/blog/443594/">interviewed</a> Nil for Habr. </li><li>  But <b>Jim Holmes</b> may be just familiar testers.  In his <a href="https://heisenbug-piter.ru/2019/spb/talks/6v96tve0i1biuzsftv7it1/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3D449324">report,</a> we will talk directly about testing.  But not about a specific technology or approach, but about a global issue: <b>how to change the testing culture in a company?</b>  Without this large-scale shift, any specific technology may be useless.  Jim we also <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/jugru/blog/429162/">interviewed</a> on Habr√©. </li></ul><br><h2>  Distributed hardcore </h2><br>  If keinouts do not require special training from the viewer (except for a general understanding of testing), then with reports labeled ‚Äúhardcore‚Äù in the program, the opposite is true.  It is no secret that distributed systems are difficult, and both reports on this topic received a hardcore icon: <br><br><ul><li>  Speaker <b>Jack Vanlightly</b> is both an architect and an engineer.  It is not surprising that he is worried about various categories of errors: design flaws and implementation bugs.  And in the <a href="https://heisenbug-piter.ru/2019/spb/talks/2anru1tomnqtvf3sajswmm/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3D449324">report</a> <b>‚ÄúA systematic approach to building reliable distributed systems,‚Äù</b> he will tell you how to deal with both. </li><li>  The theme of distributed systems <a href="https://heisenbug-piter.ru/2019/spb/talks/3wkmnm029cvca9ycdx3cnk/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3D449324">will be developed by</a> <b>Nissan Haramati</b> .  Such systems are dealt with in Wallaroo Labs, where he works, and there they came to the conclusion that, in the case of them, the combination of property-based testing and end-to-end testing helps.  This will be discussed. </li></ul><br><h2>  Security </h2><br>  This time there is a whole block of security reports: <br><br><ul><li>  Even if you yourself are not connected with it, you may be interested in the <a href="https://heisenbug-piter.ru/2019/spb/talks/1ocfsya5zgrvruv8vf2mmm/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3D449324">report</a> ‚ÄúArmor <b>Shishkin</b> 's Vulnerability is a lucky bug.‚Äù  Artyom specializes in reverse engineering, works at Intel, loves low-level programming, and then you might think "the report will be for the same people, but I have nothing to do there."  But in fact, his performance is designed for testers and developers of all specializations.  In the report, Artyom will consider common points: what bugs are more dangerous and why, how are they fighting against vulnerabilities. </li><li>  Another report will also be useful even if you are not deeply immersed in the topic of security.  Of course, in 2019, the words ‚ÄúXSS-vulnerability‚Äù will not surprise anyone, only from the list of common vulnerabilities in OWASP Top 10, they have not gone away, that is, the topic does not cease to be relevant.  <b>Over</b> the past year, <b>Ivan Rumak</b> found 54 XSS-bugs in vulnerability scan programs, including those from large companies, and he <a href="https://heisenbug-piter.ru/2019/spb/talks/4ujtqddxog5gekizpaxjza/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3D449324">will share</a> his search methodology on Heisenbug. </li><li>  The list of possible threats is not limited to XSS, and the <a href="https://heisenbug-piter.ru/2019/spb/talks/2fb81zspwwcndhxryttwjk/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3D449324">report of</a> <b>Denis Rybin</b> (Digital Security) <b>‚ÄúThe request is not there‚Äù is</b> devoted to another formidable abbreviation SSRF (server side request forgery).  This vulnerability is also included in the OWASP Top 10. What is it, what does it threaten and how to protect against it? </li><li>  If it‚Äôs not some particular type of vulnerability that is interested in, but ‚Äúwhich attack vectors for my application are possible‚Äù and ‚Äúhow malicious hackers will start their actions in my attitude‚Äù, then the <a href="https://heisenbug-piter.ru/2019/spb/talks/4rh7e56hb1tcwfsbxozrnx/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3D449324">report of</a> <b>Igor Lyrchikov</b> (Digital Security) <b>penetration testing</b> . <b>"</b> </li></ul><br><h2>  Mobile Testing </h2><br>  Three reports will suit mobile applications from different angles: <br><br><ul><li>  In the case of Uber, the cost of the error is high: for a service of this scale, even a minute downtime means huge losses.  Therefore, from such a company it is interesting to hear about its approach to testing - and <b>Yuri Dymov</b> <a href="https://heisenbug-piter.ru/2019/spb/talks/4ka1g2ajalg1sxavpker1q%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3D449324">will tell</a> about the part that relates to iOS development. </li><li>  <b>Timur Khasanov</b> (VKontakte) <a href="https://heisenbug-piter.ru/2019/spb/talks/4kqbvkhkyxoei4wdhpmnvr/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3D449324">will</a> also <a href="https://heisenbug-piter.ru/2019/spb/talks/4kqbvkhkyxoei4wdhpmnvr/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3D449324">talk</a> about iOS, but not about the approach as a whole, but about a very specific question: about the proper development of UI-tests for iOS with native tools. </li><li>  But <b>Eng Lee</b> (Google) does not attach a <a href="https://heisenbug-piter.ru/2019/spb/talks/7nlsnsyczypjanrhfgcrhi/">report</a> to a specific platform: he will talk about mobile testing automation in general and consider how with one tool you can test at least Android, at least iOS, even a thermostat. </li></ul><br><h2>  Stress Testing </h2><br>  Three reports will be downloaded as follows: <br><br><ul><li>  Those who are engaged in load testing are not required to submit <b>Alexey Lavrenyuk</b> , who develops open-source projects Yandex.Tank, Volta and Pandora.  At Heisenbug, he had previously made presentations related to both <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DFRWvJpwyYrU">Volta</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3Dgws7L3EaeC0">Tank</a> , and now it‚Äôs the turn to deal in detail with the Pandora load generator.  How does it work and how can you write your own script for Go?  Answers - in the <a href="https://heisenbug-piter.ru/2019/spb/talks/6fk5evpsjippgsszb0ks4s/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3D449324">report</a> . </li><li>  Many people know how to use Apache JMeter, but do they do it optimally?  With JMeter, they test performance, but what about the performance of the JMeter itself?  <b>Vyacheslav Smirnov</b> (Raiffeisenbank) in his <a href="https://heisenbug-piter.ru/2019/spb/talks/6nil8yukhzr9qd18pzakmh/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3D449324">report</a> considers approaches to the optimal scripting, which saves on load machines. </li><li>  Big companies are big loads.  Therefore, it is not surprising that the speaker‚Äôs report from <b>MegaFon</b> is about loadings: <b>Vladimir Khonin</b> <a href="https://heisenbug-piter.ru/2019/spb/talks/53rtktwezbwcdpkjlla6cy/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3D449324">will talk</a> about how the company approached load testing of Unified Billing. </li></ul><br><h2>  Large companies </h2><br>  MegaFon was far from being the only large company among those where the speakers of this Heisenbug work.  Intel, Uber, IBM, Yandex, Google, Badoo, Salesforce - and this is not a complete list of high-profile names.  We have already mentioned some of the relevant reports, and here are a couple of examples of what their employees will be talking about. <br><br><ul><li>  From Google, as many as two representatives with different themes.  We have already written about <b>Eng Lee</b> 's report on test automation in the mobile world, and <b>Andrei Lushnikov</b> <a href="https://heisenbug-piter.ru/2019/spb/talks/1rbzooshkfwclrj9rcflyb/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3D449324">will</a> also <a href="https://heisenbug-piter.ru/2019/spb/talks/1rbzooshkfwclrj9rcflyb/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3D449324">talk</a> about automation, but in connection with the web and Puppeteer. </li><li>  And <b>Vladimir Solodov</b> and <b>Viktor Koronevich</b> from <b>Badoo</b> <a href="https://heisenbug-piter.ru/2019/spb/talks/dzcix0dqusgczmgey5j3m/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3D449324">will talk</a> about their approach to testing payments. </li></ul><br><h2>  Rest </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zt/pa/ad/ztpaaddo-5lcymddbbx1n7v1xry.jpeg"><br><br>  This list of reports does not end there - there are those that are difficult thematically combined with others.  And in the program changes and additions are possible.  Therefore, in order to understand whether you want to go to a conference, it‚Äôs most reliable to look at the program <a href="https://heisenbug-piter.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3D449324">on the website</a> : there it is always in the most current and complete state.  You can buy tickets in the same place - until May 1, they still have a discount. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/449324/">https://habr.com/ru/post/449324/</a></p>
