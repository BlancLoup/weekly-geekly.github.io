I will try to conduct some analysis of the firmware I have tested.  Unfortunately, everyone has flaws - and this is natural: there is no perfect code.  What did you end up with when using different firmwares? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <i>Disclaimer: all conclusions are absolutely subjective and made on the basis of the use of firmware by <u>me</u> on <u>my</u> device.</i> <br>  What I would not want to lose: <br>  1. Control music from wired headset buttons <br>  2. Reading the name of the caller in the BT-headset (voice Caller ID) using the Enhanced Caller ID application <br>  3. If possible, combining the contacts of FB and Google of one person into a single metacontact <br><br>  <b>Virtuous Affinity.</b>  One of the first ports of Android 4.0 on Desire HD.  WiFi works quite crookedly, in general, somewhat damp, periodic logs, increased battery power.  Removed 4 days after flashing.  Sense is missing. <br><br>  <b>Virtuous Infinity.</b>  Enough successful port Android 4.0.3 with devices of the One series.  Voice Caller ID and music management from the headset do not work.  Sense is available, therefore, you can combine contacts (the only thing I need from Sense).  With prolonged use without restarting the brakes appear, there is little space for installing applications.  A big plus - implemented OTA-update.  At the same time, the OS kernel is not updated.

      <b>CyanogenMod 10 unofficial.</b>  Android 4.1.2.  The complete absence of Sense, therefore, the impossibility of combining contacts with an embedded application.  Headset buttons and voice Caller ID do not work (in fact, it has become a regularity in all 4.x firmware).  The almost complete absence of noteworthy system tweaks. <br><br>  <b>Jellybean JellyTime.</b>  Based on CyanogenMod 10. Releases from 12 to 15 behaved well, even with a "dirty" update (without returning the phone to factory settings or formatting partitions).  Unfortunately, in each new release the author constantly repaired something, and it turned out like in the joke: old bugs were removed, new ones were added.  As a result, after the 18th release, I finally left this firmware.  Everything that I would not like to lose was lost. <br><br>  <b>Nik Project X.</b> Rarely updated firmware with full Sense based on Android 4.0.3.  The author manually modified the mass of stock Sense applications for use on Desire HD.  In general, it turned out well, it can be recommended for use.  However, personally, I was faced with the fact that by the evening the phone must be starting to slow down wildly, which was treated only by a reboot.  By tradition, the same non-working headset buttons and voice CID.  Re-flashing did not save the situation, so after a while I switched to <br><br>  <b>CodefireX.</b>  This firmware is also based on CyanogenMod 10, nice tweaks of the system have been added (for example, setting the status bar view).  The illnesses are the same as those of other non-Sense firmwares: failure on all 3 of my points.  Everything: a long launch of some applications (Tweetcaster, Facebook, Opera Mini), sometimes turning into just a black screen.  It appears after several days of uptime.  You can start it only by killing the application in the background, for example, using GO Power Master. <br><br>  <b>PACman.</b>  The latest version lived on my phone for a maximum of a couple of hours - unfortunately, in my favorite launcher GO Launcher EX, colors ‚Äúcame out‚Äù (for example, white letters on a light gray background in the context menus). <br><br>  For 2 months, I changed the firmware, updated to more recent versions, compared ... As a result, I flashed CyanogenMod 7 (Android 2.3.7).  It feels like coming home.  All that is required is working ( <s>well, except for merging contacts, except perhaps the cost of having no Sense</s> already found).  The phone does not slow down (the zip file with the firmware is only 88 MB in size, compared with 150 MB for CM10 or 300+ MB for Sense firmware), all the necessary software works as it should.  From here, one can make such a subjective conclusion that Desire HD is not particularly adapted for Android 4.x - the requirements for iron are maintained, as they say, ‚Äúvnatyag‚Äù.  But 2.3 does an excellent job.  A logical question arises: is this race really necessary for the most recent version? .. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/160669/">https://habr.com/ru/post/160669/</a></p>
