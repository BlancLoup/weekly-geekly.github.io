Initially, he was interested in us, as it has ‚ÄúHeadless Mode‚Äù, medium size, interesting design and a camera with 2 megapixels.  When he came and we saw the camera - I wanted to immediately throw it somewhere away, to the same place where the stock camera from Syma X5C lies, but still we took it for testing and this is what came of it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d47/10d/03f/d4710d03f3b54634924f302926760fc5.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  During the test, we took a few photos, here is one of them: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e81/563/3d2/e815633d24d741f1acfec8974adc2f7d.JPG"><br><br>  The most attentive ones could notice that it is of quite decent quality, that is, it is an honest shot on a camera with 2 MP at a resolution of 1280x720.  But we didn‚Äôt notice this immediately, so we started the usual flight tests.

      <b>Stability</b> <br>  I think that beginners will appreciate the smoothness of his movements in the low-power mode.  And those who already had experience in managing quadcopters will be able to train their skills in passing obstacles on it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/865/606/478/865606478ed348b0b67d2a8e1a83bead.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Flight Modes</b> <br>  If we are talking about modes, I immediately note that there are three of them here.  Changing the mode is very simple, just press the left button, under the index finger, on the controller.  One squeak - the first mode.  Two squeaks - the second mode.  Three squeaks - the third mode. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d7f/f8b/872/d7ff8b872b40443b8cab93d43c3b64a6.jpg"><br><br>  And now, in the third mode, real fun begins to tame the quadrocopter.  We give full throttle and full tilt forward and the quadrocopter sweeps away at great speed.  And this is where the ‚ÄúHeadless Mode‚Äù comes in handy. <br><br>  <b>Functions</b> <br>  <b>Headless Mode</b> , aka "Headless Mode".  Named so not because of his lack of conscience and carelessness, but for the functional removal of the ‚Äúhead‚Äù.  In short, in this mode, it does not matter which side has blue front lights or red-rear lights.  Where initially turned his face - there is now "forward."  That is, you can fly off for tens of meters, twist around its axis, and then push the stick back and it will obediently fly to your side.  For quadcopters who do not have GPS, this is an excellent mode so as not to get lost. <br><br>  <b>Flips</b> .  Like any self-respecting quadrocopter for entertainment, Nihui can also do flips in all directions with one button.  To do this, press the right button under the index finger on the controller and press the right stick in the direction in which you want to flip. <br><br>  <b>Camera</b> <br>  A bit higher, I already showed both a photo and an example video from the NIHUI TOYS U807.  I must say that for me it was a big surprise.  That is, usually quadcopters for this cost contain a camera for a tick.  She shoots in terribly low resolution and I don‚Äôt even want to watch such a video.  But I watched the video from the U807th with pleasure and can advise it to those who want to get a toy, but with the ability to get footage from the family chronicle that can be saved. <br><br>  Video example: <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/jPrXxl8Q1S0%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700002,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhj1I_89--BvyXOEtegXYzDPdthTgg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  By the way, turn off the video and take photos is very convenient with the right button under the index finger.  If you want to take a photo - make a short press, if you want to turn on or turn off the video - press for a couple of seconds until you hear the signal.  To make sure that the photo is taken - look at the camera from the bottom - the green light flashes red.  When you turn on video recording, the red light will flash constantly. <br><br>  A couple more photos from the quadcopter: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d62/0c2/3dc/d620c23dc90745edb9c29fb1a1582a09.JPG"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/564/1c6/5e9/5641c65e937f428b9415f70ed7a8aae1.JPG"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9ed/2ca/4aa/9ed2ca4aad5b4ceeb8a3ed42d6a938ad.jpg"><br><br>  <b>A pair of warnings</b> <br>  The only thing I want to warn you about is do not forget to turn off the video with one more long press of the button.  My video was simply not saved if I turned it off by turning off the power. <br><br>  Make sure that the camera is well fixed, as it tends to fall out of the mount. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/199/188/5b7/1991885b745a4f70aa377b215cafa80f.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Equipment:</b> <br>  First of all, everything is packed very carefully.  In one main box 3 more internal boxes were found.  One for a quadcopter, the second for the remote and the third for other trivia. <br><br>  The whole package looks like this: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8f4/bf5/9c4/8f4bf59c4f334ae6b468c8d70afa2b74.jpg"><br><br>  <b>findings</b> <br>  Personally, I liked the quadrocopter.  He easily survived a lot of beauty during the tests at home, he was pleased with the speed and stability on the street, he was pleasantly surprised by the tolerable picture in the video and photos.  And most importantly, all this is for little money ( <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/8">$ 49.79</a> , including delivery to Russia). <br><br>  That's all, successful flight, you wish service on the choice of quadrocopters <a href="http://dronk.ru/">Dronk.Ru</a> <br><br>  ps Do not forget to subscribe to our <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/dronk/blog/">blog</a> , there will be many more interesting things. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/365829/">https://habr.com/ru/post/365829/</a></p>
