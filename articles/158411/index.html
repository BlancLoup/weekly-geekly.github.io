      The information in this article is an extract of our experience gained over several years of production of promotional videos in <a href="https://alconost.com/services/video-production%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr%26utm_medium%3Darticle%26utm_campaign%3Down_article%26utm_content%3Dvideo-trailer-script-howto">Alconost</a> .  We see video selling scenarios in this way and hope that this knowledge can be useful to you. <br><br>  So, you need a script for a trailer roller, which in a couple of minutes would tell the viewer about the product, while not tired and eventually helped to make the right decision - download the trial version, register in the system, fill in the pre-order form (underline). <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h2>  Content </h2><br>  To begin with, think about and formulate a problem for which the user will come to you.  In your video you should sell the solution to the problem of the viewer.  The whole video should be built around the problem and show its solution.  No one is interested to know what features your product has or why it is more unique than other unique products.  You need to show the viewer that his problem is solved in this way with the help of this tool.  All that remains for the viewer to do is to step up and take this instrument. <br><br>  Summary: focus on problem solving and benefits, not features.  Sell ‚Äã‚Äãa hole in the wall, not a drill. <br><br><h2>  The form </h2><br>  When it became clear to WHAT to tell the viewer, the time has come to decide on HOW to say it. <br><br>  We recommend to split the script into five logical consecutive blocks: Fixation - Distraction - Team - Care - Stop (abbreviated - FOCUS, the name is taken from NLP). <br><br>  Consider in detail each of these stages. <br><br><h3>  Fixing </h3><br>  The beginning of the video.  Capture and fix the viewer's attention in the first five seconds of the video.  The best solution for this is a command like <i>‚ÄúResolve% PROBLEM NAME%% AS% using% PRODUCT_NAME%‚Äù</i> . <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Examples</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Create colorful slideshows from your photos from PhotoShow ... <br>  Mark your folders in just two clicks with Folder Marker ... <br>  Control your PC ... </div></div><br>  If the problem really worries the viewer - he will stay with you and look at least the next twenty seconds of the video. <br><br><h3>  Abstraction </h3><br>  NLP gurus teach: "Distract the consciousness, and the unconscious will remain open to your commands."  If, after fixing the attention, to present the audience with some kind of truism (a fact that is not objectionable), then the level of confidence in the video will increase. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Examples</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  The basis of any successful online business is a high position in search results ... <br>  All folders look the same <br>  In the modern world, in order to run a business, there is no longer any need to gather people in one office .... </div></div><br>  After that, it is necessary to consolidate the interest of the viewer and describe in detail the problem for which he came to you. <br><br>  Alternatively, you can show an ideal image of what the viewer could have. <br><br><h3>  Team </h3><br>  When the viewer has already realized that the described problem coincides with his problem, it's time to give him the solution, which is in% PRODUCT_NAME% <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Examples</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  For quick translations of small texts, use Nitro, a live online translator that will allow you to ... <br>  To assess the uniqueness of your texts, use the Plagiarism Detector ... </div></div><br>  A beautiful logo, a couple of lines of text saying what the product does is what you need for this stage.  Now the viewer knows that his problem can be solved, and we can only show exactly how.  For this, screencasts are usually used, showing specific user actions.  Important: all actions should be as simple and clear as possible.  If you have a step in the product, where you have to stop your clicks with the mouse - try to get around it, do not focus attention on it.  Important: the way to solve the problem should be short (3-4 steps) and unambiguous. <br><br>  The selling video is not a tutorial, there should not be a long explanation of how to use the product. <br><br><h3>  Care </h3><br>  Everything, your viewer: he already knows what to do to make his problem solved.  Let's distract him a little, give a little rest, make a small emotional pause.  Here you need to tell about the features of the product, about all sorts of useful (cool, if also free!) Nishtyachkah offered by the product. <br><br>  To make the springboard before the motivating finale, do not forget to summarize the solution to the problem and tell the viewer about the benefits derived from the use of the product: <i>Thus,% PRODUCT_NAME% will not only help you to solve%% PROBLEM%, but also allow% BENEFIT1%,% BENEFIT2%,% BENEFIT3%.</i> <br><br><h3>  Stop </h3><br>  The last seconds of the video should urge the user to do the action you need: visit the site, download the trial version, buy the product, register in the system, write a letter, fill out the order form, contact the manager, etc. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Examples</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Act right now!  Download free trial version at ... <br>  Register and start using the service for free right now! </div></div><br>  That's it, the script is ready.  It remains only to make a cool video on it, which will bring you tons of visits, downloads, registrations and further down the list;) <br><br>  Finally I want to say: concentrate, do not spray.  One problem - one solution to the problem - one video.  If your product solves several problems - make a few clips.  After all, it is better to have several selling commercials than one that does not sell. <br><br>  Thanks for attention! <br><br><br>  <b>about the author</b> <br><br>  Alconost is engaged in the <a href="https://alconost.com/services/software-localization%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr%26utm_medium%3Darticle%26utm_campaign%3Down_article%26utm_content%3Dvideo-trailer-script-howto">localization of applications, games and websites</a> in 60 languages.
