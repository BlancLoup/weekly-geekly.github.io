As for the first part, the bills that relate to it prohibit the publication of inaccurate socially significant information, which is disseminated under the guise of truthful messages if it threatens the life, health, property of citizens or undermines public order or security. <br><br>  As for the second part, it is proposed to block publications that offend human dignity and public morality, as well as the state. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  It all works as follows.  If a fake is found, the Prosecutor General of Russia or his deputies apply to Roskomnadzor with the requirement to take measures to restrict access to violating resources.  The Office must then notify the editors of the faulty publication about the need to remove inaccurate information.  The date and time of sending the notification are recorded, for which a special information system is created. 
      <br>

        </script>
      <br>
      The publication must remove inaccurate information immediately after receiving the document. <br><br>  Otherwise, Roskomnadzor has the right to restrict access to the resource.  If the media removes the fake after the temporary blocking, the appropriate notification should be submitted to Roskomnadzor and access to the resource after the check will be resumed.  This order does not work if the information is hosted by the news aggregator. <br><br>  As for fines, since the time of the second reading their size has not changed much.  So, for fakes that created a threat to life or health, as well as public order, there are penalties in the amount of: for individuals - from 30 to 100 thousand rubles with ‚Äúwith confiscation of the subject of an administrative offense or without it‚Äù;  for legal entities - from 200 to 500 thousand rubles, with confiscation;  for officials - from 60 to 200 thousand rubles. <br><br>  In the event that a fake caused interference in the operation of life-support objects, transport or social structure, communications, energy, the amount of fines will be: for citizens - from 100 to 300 thousand rubles with confiscation;  for legal entities - from 500 thousand rubles to a million;  for officials - from 300 to 600 thousand rubles. <br><br>  For fakes that caused the death of a person, caused harm to health or property, stopped the normal operation of life-support objects, transport or social structure, communications, energy, it is proposed to introduce the following penalties: for citizens - from 300 to 400 thousand rubles with confiscation;  for legal entities - from one million to one and a half million rubles;  for officials - from 600 to 900 thousand rubles. <br><br>  In all the cases listed above, the procurator's bodies must recognize within 24 hours. <br><br><h3>  Insult of the state and society </h3><br>  If information is found that offends the state or society, the Prosecutor General or his deputies should also contact Roskomnadzor.  The latter must follow the removal of such information or block the resource. <br><br>  For such violations, it is recommended to introduce administrative liability.  In this case, the fines will range from 30 to 100 thousand rubles. <br><br>  In case of repeated violation, the payment grows and ranges from 100 to 200 thousand rubles.  Possible and administrative arrest for up to 15 days. <br><br>  If a similar action was committed by a person who has already been subjected to administrative punishment for a similar crime more than two times, then he will face a fine in the amount of 200 to 300 thousand rubles or an administrative arrest of up to 15 days. <br><br>  It was <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/442802/">decided to use</a> fines in order to ‚Äúestablish an economic barrier‚Äù for those who decided to distribute fake news.  ‚ÄúBarriers must be fined so that a person, official or legal entity thinks a thousand times whether or not to do it,‚Äù said Pavel Krasheninnikov, chairman of the State Duma‚Äôs constitutional committee. <br><br>  Bills to combat fake news and disrespect for the government were submitted to the State Duma in December 2018 by a group of parliamentarians headed by the chairman of the committee on <br>  the constitutional legislation of the Council of the Federation Andrei Klishas. <br><blockquote><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jy/sd/rr/jysdrr7tqgfjt50wtcshw89ctho.png" align="left"><h3>  Minute of care from UFO </h3><br>  This material could cause contradictory feelings, so before writing a comment, refresh something important in your memory: <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">How to write a comment and survive</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><ul><li>  Do not write abusive comments, do not go to the person. </li><li>  Refrain from using obscene language and toxic behavior (even in a veiled form). </li><li>  To report comments that violate the rules of the site, use the "Report" button (if available) or <a href="https://habr.com/feedback/%3Ftype%3D4">a feedback form</a> . </li></ul><br>  What to do if: <a href="https://habr.com/info/help/karma/">minus karma</a> |  <a href="https://habr.com/info/help/sandbox/">blocked account</a> <br><br>  ‚Üí <a href="https://habr.com/info/help/other/">Code of authors Habra</a> and <a href="https://habr.com/info/help/other/">habraetiket</a> <br>  ‚Üí <a href="https://habr.com/info/help/rules/">Full site rules</a> </div></div></blockquote></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/442974/">https://habr.com/ru/post/442974/</a></p>
