Freelance is still a business, if you will, a brand.  He does not sleep or eat, and does not go to discos with friends.  After all, no company goes home in the evenings with its employees.  Just in the windows the lights go out, and the work is waiting for the next fruitful day. <br><br>  In order not to be unfounded, I will have to announce for the first time that I am one of those freelancers who present several blurry versions of themselves.  I consider this position necessary, since some information may simply frighten off customers.  We all, to one degree or another, play different roles in order to attract potential customers.  I do not hide any crimes, of course.  But at a certain point, I realized that people, and especially customers, do not have to know various intimate details.  Especially if they can not affect the work.

    <a name="habracut"></a>  Many do not realize that their actions on the network can adversely affect their careers, and meanwhile, the blogosphere is full of warnings on this topic.  A professional approach to publishing online for a freelancer is a kind of protection against losing customers.  And therefore, care about the future of the business.  A personal blog that started many years ago, along with Twitter and a podcast feed, I keep quite apart from the resources that are somehow related to work.  So you can be more or less sure that my political views or personal convictions will not affect the business. <br><br><h4>  How important is it? </h4><br>  Those of us who work with a professional alter-ego have to learn to put a line under it, thus dividing ourselves.  Of course, this feature can, and even should be somewhat blurred.  In order to prosper a personal brand, we strive to keep it that way - personal.  That is, roughly speaking, a person with a voice, face and name must still look through the designer.  And everyone asks a question - what can a client learn about us, and what is better to hide from him?  And as the blogosphere is replete with warnings about the need to think about the content of publications, so many consider it necessary for the freelancer to turn their own faces into a brand. <br><br>  It happens, of course, that such a sociable stranger will take and expose to the general court the most intimate information in response to a warm greeting.  And so thoroughly spoil the work on the brand, which was carried out for a long period of time - all in any few minutes.  For a moment, let's be honest and recognize that, despite the fact that sometimes we are very interested to know what people are hiding behind our favorite brands, we don‚Äôt want to know everything about them.  Some of their qualities are more pleasant for us to finish in the imagination. <br><br>  Here I, of course, cannot be categorical about all people, but once in the community we raised such a topic.  And we came to the conclusion that we would like all our favorite freelancers to remain - partially - a mystery.  Why?  Maybe we like to draw them in a certain light?  Maybe we ourselves want to be like them, and therefore we put in a certain place - which one we like more - on the universal pedestal?  And sometimes we just do not care about redundant information. <br><br>  In general, whatever one may say, but it still turns out that the information has to be delivered dosed, because no professional contacts need to undress the poor freelancer, sorry for the metaphor.  In my case, it‚Äôs not necessary for potential clients to know what my political convictions are, since this absolutely does not apply to work.  And what's more, sometimes it can scare everyone away.  Well, if something not related to work, can positively affect it.  But what if the effect is reversed? <br><br>  For me, one of the indisputable advantages of freelancing is that I can always refuse to perform this or that service for absolutely any reason - and this will in no way affect the relationship with the customer.  For example, I am a vegan and would not agree to provide my design services to a company that produces food from meat, eggs, milk and other things.  But this does not mean that I will openly take and describe the reason for the refusal.  Because, having laid out so easily the entire inside story, it is very easy to lose the brand's reputation.  It is always advantageous to thank politely for the offer, but at the same time to say that at the moment we, unfortunately, cannot cooperate.  You can even recommend other freelancers who have nothing against the consumption of animal food.  So, even if we hide in some cases behind the mask of professionalism, this does not at all mean giving up one of the sides of the personality.  We continue to be ourselves. <br><br>  So, if you decide to turn your freelancing business into a brand, then such beliefs are best - at least - to keep in mind.  Think about the need to draw a line between your personality and a freelancer.  Many turn to freelancing, believing that it provides absolute freedom to be yourself.  But in the interests of business, they have to change their beliefs.  At least in part, the word "absolute".  The main thing is to remember that some of your qualities may prevent the creation of a brand.  But in no case does this mean that you need to destroy them in yourself.  Simply, in the professional sphere, one way or another, you will be presented with any expectations. <br><br><h4>  And what are these expectations? </h4><br>  It is hardly possible to overestimate the importance of its own brand, and therefore it is vital for him that the ability of a freelancer to ponder upon actions.  This can be especially useful in situations where you have to answer delicate informal questions.  It is necessary to learn to understand exactly what expectations the customer feeds regarding the brand - and then you can understand how large and which part of the personality should be invested in its creation, and in what proportions it is worth mixing the personal approach with the professional one. <br><br>  And the expectations will be varied, which is natural for the freelance arenas, which you ascended along with the individual trying on the readiness to become a brand.  But some rules apply here everywhere. <br><br>  <b>Originality</b> <br>  First, people will expect originality.  They will want to cooperate with a unique and individual brand, and therefore, of course, it is worth investing in it some part of you as an individual.  But the mix is ‚Äã‚Äãunlikely to be limited to this.  After all, there are other ways to create a unique image.  Isn't this a great opportunity to think and be creative? <br><br>  <b>Professionalism</b> <br>  Secondly, everyone will want to cooperate with a high-class specialist.  Let's spend enough time developing professional skills and knowledge.  Definitely, this is a factor that can make everyone take seriously your business - and you will create the impression of a person you can rely on.  Yes, yes, not only your brand, but you too.  Rather, that part of your personality that you decide to inject your work into. <br><br>  <b>Clear view</b> <br>  Regardless of how many facts about yourself you want to bring to the business, always keep in mind that people will want to have a clear idea about the person with whom they intend to cooperate.  Therefore, it is worth making sure once again whether personal information does not interfere with the perception of the message your brand carries - does it sound clear enough to the public and potential customers?  The more professionally a freelancer puts himself, the clearer people‚Äôs perception of him as a brand, and personal information doesn‚Äôt bother anyone to communicate with him on topics relating to work. <br><br>  <b>Sequence</b> <br>  No matter how you decide to present the brand, be sure to consider what customers will expect from you logical and consistent behavior.  Therefore, whatever the proportions of your individual in such a business cocktail, try to withstand them and not go too far from the intended path, especially if you have been walking along it for a long time.  Any serious shift can cause no less serious harm to work. <br><br><h4>  Finally </h4><br>  Perhaps, a hippie who strives for balance says in me, but I sincerely believe in the importance of such a struggle for a balance of personal and professional approach to creating a freelance brand.  However, I do not doubt that anyone will express different considerations from my comments in the article.  Whatever you end up with, I will be glad to know fresh thoughts about the material just set forth by your humble servant. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/111529/">https://habr.com/ru/post/111529/</a></p>
