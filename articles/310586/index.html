To exalt their empire over the others, they are willing to risk everything.  Familiar, is not it?  Reminds Vasteras.  Everyone there wants to sit on the Iron Throne;  everyone there is fighting for the honor of his house.  A series of books by George R.R.  Martina's ‚ÄúSong of Ice and Flame‚Äù, which was converted into a cult television show, has become a religion for many people around the world.  Books are written in the fantasy genre, but in general it is a story about men and women leading a bloody war for the possession of the not very convenient Iron Throne, the source of absolute power.  The storyline tells of troubles, joys and sorrows, similar to those that a startup usually experiences.  Naturally, there are characters with strong leadership qualities who can tack on the world of intricate problems and emotions.  Therefore, you can learn a lot from the representatives of the houses of this world:

    <h3>  House of Starks: Winter is coming </h3><br>  One of the most beloved by fans of homes and the most common saying on the Internet is ‚ÄúWinter is close,‚Äù which means that we must prepare for the worst.  The most famous and respected of Starkov, Lord Eddard, taught the most ingenious lesson in the very first season of the show: everyone should do his own work.  He beheaded all his enemies personally.  Co-founder of the company Etailer BigBasket - Gary Manon - he looks through the correspondence, cleans up in his office, orders tickets and makes tea for himself.  Managing company Hector Beverages- Neerazh Kakkar- often travels by public transport.  The golden mean is somewhere between the delegation of all tasks and the principle of "do it yourself". <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/400/7bd/9c8/4007bd9c8aee9be7df17e987eefdfac2.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Another lesson from Robb Stark, Ned Stark's son, is to keep his word.  Robb married Jane Westerling (based on the book) / Talise Maygir (according to the film), despite promising to marry one of Walder Frey‚Äôs daughters, which cost him his life and caused the tragic ‚ÄúBloody Wedding‚Äù.  Without knowing the ford, do not poke your nose in the water.  Do not make promises that you cannot keep.  Otherwise, you can lose loyal customers. <br><br><h3>  Lannister House: Hear My Roar </h3><br>  We often hear Cersei Lannister say: "Power is power."  There would be no competition without power, and for entrepreneurs who are just starting their own business, it is very important to clearly understand how much power they have.  Become a force that is reckoned with, and you can, like the Lannister, win the lost wars.  Find a weak spot in the market, be smarter than your competitors, and grab the market faster than them. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/38a/de6/1c6/38ade61c6a9f5b73f2684c44128c815c.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  Not to mention another popular motto of the Lannister: "Lannister always pay their debts."  The motto of the richest house of Westeros fits all.  Therefore, pay your debts as quickly as possible, because they spoil your balance sheets.  This advice applies not only to commercial debts, but also to personal loans and accounts, because your financial reputation will be taken into account by potential investors. <br>  See also: <a href="http://www.startup-buzz.com/entrepreneurial-lessons-learn-noble-men-women-game-thrones/">Business lessons from the heroes of the ‚ÄúGame of Thrones‚Äù characters</a> <br><br><h3>  House Targaryenov: Flame and Blood </h3><br>  Entrepreneurial activity always entails leaving the comfort zone after dreams, which can be quite unconventional, breaking the usual flow of things, and enticing other people with their ideas.  Daneiris wants to see Essos free from the bondage of slavery.  Announcing her ideas in cities where slavery-Myerin, Yunkai, Astapor traditionally flourishes, it attracts the attention of millions of people and becomes the head of Myerin.  The dragon‚Äôs mother‚Äôs highest quality is her vision ‚Äî she uses it to build faith in the hearts of her followers.  Deaneris began her journey with a minimum of resources, but with a clear plan to change the rules of the game.  She wanted to be a queen who believes in equality, not slavery.  Remember what she said to Tirion?  ‚ÄúI don't want to stop the wheel.  I'm going to break it. ‚Äù  Startup is also important to have a clear vision.  Moreover, it is necessary to be able to express and present it in a favorable light in order to attract customers and investors. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2f9/7f0/df2/2f97f0df2faba5a5c070305808c45380.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Samyak Chakrabarti, Managing Director of Social Quotient, a social marketing and communications company, says: ‚ÄúIt is important for an entrepreneur that his team believe in an idea, and it is important to be able to evoke unconditional dedication.  This implies the ability to sell a collective idea.  Finding people who are willing to die for your idea is the very first test. ‚Äù <br><br><h3>  House Tully: Family, duty, honor </h3><br>  Mantra is for everyone, no one can play the game alone.  Our team, i.e.  family is very important in the game.  A team whose members believe in each other, and in their leaders, and which is ready to fight day and night for their work, their support is one of the most important things for the company. <br><br><h3>  House of Baratheons: We are angry </h3><br>  Although many do not like Stannis Baratheon, one cannot deny his potential and honesty.  Remember the conversation of Stannis and Davos with representatives of the Iron Bank of Braavos?  Bankers asked about the resources of Stannis and refused to sponsor him because of their absence.  But Davos began to talk about the fairness of Stannis and the potential to become the Defender of the Power. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/09c/9d1/ed7/09c9d1ed743b91c4f7193d9c805755b1.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Your idea should have growth potential, don't hesitate, even if all you have is an idea with great potential.  Go for it.  Investors themselves will come to you. <br><br><h3>  Tyrell House: Growing Up </h3><br>  As follows from the motto, Tyrell ambitions make them one of the strongest houses.  They helped the Lannisters win the war.  Moreover, Margery Tyrell, twice a widow, boldly and piercingly looks into the future.  It is very important to have a crystal clear goal for your company. <br><br>  Moreover, everyone remembers how Margheri helped the ordinary people of Westeros as best she could, while chaos and unrest reigned there under the rule of Joffrey.  People loved her more than other members of the royal family.  You should also win customer trust by meeting all their needs.  The customer is your king, so try to satisfy all his needs. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8f9/23b/140/8f923b140760a61dfe221618b53207d3.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  P√©tir Beilish: Although this character does not belong to any noble house, the Little Finger is the personification of the ideal business.  He was not born in a wealthy family, but perseverance, diligence and perseverance brought him vast political power.  In addition, his knowledge helped him to stay in the game, and change the course of it at will.  Any successful businessman knows that these qualities are extremely important, and it is they who will ensure success in the long term.  He says: ‚ÄúChaos is not abyss.  Chaos is a ladder.  Many of those who tried to climb on it fell down and did not try again.  The fall broke them.  And some are given a chance to climb it, they cling to a nation, gods or love.  Only the ladder itself is real. ‚Äù <br><br>  ‚ÄúNow you're in the big game, and the big game is terrifying.‚Äù -Tirion Lannister, Game of Thrones. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6c3/f81/505/6c3f81505d1bd5ac63a3cee9d7098d8d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The world of startups is the game, know the rules of the game and play it with dignity without fear of losing. <br>  See also: <a href="http://www.startup-buzz.com/content-marketing-strategies-boost-startup/">Using content marketing strategies to develop a startup</a> <br><br>  Source: <a href="http://www.startup-buzz.com/strategize-for-your-startup-with-these-lessons-from-game-of-thrones/">StartUP Buzz</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/310586/">https://habr.com/ru/post/310586/</a></p>
