If Yuri Shevchuk composed his song in our time, I am sure that the words would be such.  And if September was almost completely under the bitten sign of Apple, then October promises to be a month of revenge for Android. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2d4/6c2/d64/2d46c2d64ed047aa88529a05e7b82a02.jpg"><br><br>  Let's get together again everything that is worth paying close attention to in October.

      <b>Android L and Nexus not 6</b> <br><br>  As a rule, in October, Google is waiting for two things: the new version of Android and the new Nexus.  With Android, everything is more or less clear - the new version is called L, it has an improved design, a more convenient notification system and a much more thrifty attitude to the battery. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/kk7FxrcQaV0%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjCzmQB1Ad7wPwdbSKx9TjLDiqthQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  It is clear that the upgrade will affect the Nexus 5 smartphone and the latest models of the Nexus 7 and 10 tablets. In addition, judging by the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/228835/">source code</a> , the Nexus 4 and the 2012 Nexus 7 and 10 tablets should receive updates.  Very, as they say, we hope. <br><br>  But with respect to the new Nexus is not yet known very much.  Rumor has it that the tablet, codenamed Nexus 9, will be releasing HTC.  The fact is that recently, Nvidia filed a lawsuit against Samsung and Qualcomm, the text of which contains the curious phrase ‚ÄúHTC Nexus 9, which is due to be released in the third quarter of 2014, is supposed to be built on the basis of Tegra K1‚Äù.  Now the text of the claim has been edited, but the leak turned out to be notable. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e8d/208/7ab/e8d2087ab80e46e5817e499ce4d8772f.jpg"><br><br>  Thus (if this is true), the future tablet will have a very powerful video chip containing as many as 192 cores.  Moreover, <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/233041/">they say</a> that K1 is specially ‚Äúsharpened‚Äù under Android L. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f16/b8c/e38/f16b8ce38a2e08ff837961d64b0825f9.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  As for the future smartphone, it is still known for sure that it will not be called Nexus 6. The fact is that the name ‚ÄúNexus-6‚Äù was used in the book ‚ÄúDo Androids Dream of Electrohobes‚Äù - there such a model of the electronic brain was installed in escaped robots .  In general, it turns out that this number is already taken.  The next Nexus 7 has also been associated with tablets for a long time and only the Nexus 8 is free for now and everything after ten.  Against this background, the most logical is the rumor about the Nexus X, which will be made by the famous smartphone manufacturer with the letter ‚ÄúX‚Äù - Motorola. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1c9/26c/b6f/1c926cb6f137446498c0bb291dc8a234.jpg"><br>  <i>The estimated appearance of the Nexus X compared to the Nexus 5. The screen size was taken as "arithmetic average"</i> <br><br>  Possible characteristics of the Nexus X: <br>  Display with a diagonal of 5.2 "(or 5.9" here the sources differ) and with a resolution of 1440x2560; <br>  Processor: Snapdragon 805 chipset with a frequency of 2.7 GHz; <br>  Memory: 3 GB RAM, 32 GB ROM; <br>  Camera: 13.1-megapixel and shooting in 4K; <br>  and of course Android 5.0 (Android L). <br>  Full estimated characteristics can be found <a href="http://www.gsmarena.com/motorola_nexus_6-6604.php">here</a> . <br><br>  In general, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe screen 5.9 ‚Äùmakes more sense.  Here and the competition with the iPhone 6 Plus, and the understanding that the Nexus 5 is still more than a decent device to change it, and in general - with this screen resolution, more than many TVs, will look just a little logical.  But we will see. <br><br>  More news from the Android camp: in October, the start of sales of the first truly round watch LG G Watch R on Android Wear is scheduled.  If you remember, the other Moto360 round watches had an annoying black sector at the very bottom of the dial - there was a display controller hiding there.  And Moto360 was made on a very outdated and energy-inefficient iron.  LG boasts that they managed to do everything much better. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/db5/0eb/030/db50eb0303a843658b0859d5bfec06ef.jpg"><br><br>  Expected characteristics: Snapdragon processor 400, OLED-display, battery with a capacity of 410 mAh (at the shop counterparts, usually 320 mAh).  Well, a nice look to boot. <br><br>  <b>Apple</b> <br><br>  As I wrote above, October will be marked by Android.  But Apple should not be forgotten.  It is expected that on October 21, the announcement of new iPads will take place - with a diagonal of 7.9 and 9.7 inches.  Those.  quite standard.  It is assumed that they will get a new A8 processor, a fingerprint scanner, they will get more memory and may become even thinner.  In general, nothing revolutionary, but a good evolution of a good product. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/248/463/645/2484636455ef4a338cc53c80100eef52.jpg"><br><br>  By the way, about the predictions of Apple, <a href="http://gizmodo.com/12-visions-of-apple-products-that-were-fantastically-wr-1630752848">here</a> is an amusing selection of not confirmed rumors about what future apple products will look like.  There are fun options. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b76/556/3ab/b765563ab2cd485487677f7f81597145.png"><br>  <i>The way fans represented the first iPad</i> <br><br>  <b>Camera of the month</b> <br><br>  As the user of the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/garbagecollector/" class="user_link">GarbageCollector</a> quite rightly said, on October 4, sales of the updated <a href="http://shop.gopro.com/Marketing/hero4">GoPro HERO4</a> will start. <br>  The older model boasts the possibility of shooting in 4K (and, finally, to justify the purchase of such a TV) and a more powerful processor.  The price corresponds to the resolution. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/18b/294/04d/18b29404df184f4badf2579f5e64fb14.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Surprise of the month</b> <br><br>  Last week it became <a href="http://gigaom.com/2014/09/23/samsung-to-stop-selling-laptops-in-europe-for-now/">known</a> that Samsung suspends the sale of laptops (including Chromebooks) in Europe.  Like, do not buy.  Like big computers in general.  So for the South Korean laptops Europeans now have to go to the States.  Or to us. <br><br>  <b>Offtopic</b> <br><br>  And as usual, in addition to high-profile innovations on the net, there are a lot of small, but very pleasant things.  My favorite of the month is a <a href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/product/1dbd/">USB</a> car <a href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/product/1dbd/">charger</a> in the form of an energy fluxuator (or a streaming drive - who watched what translation) from the movie ‚ÄúBack to the Future‚Äù.  Moreover, the sparks in the glass tubes move - almost all of this. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ac5/7ad/1dd/ac57ad1dd7a7438a886bbcd211d1097a.jpg"><br><br>  The charger has two USB connectors: one for 1A, the second for 2A (for smartphone and tablet).  However, we understand that USB is not important there.  Price in the States: $ 25.  Translated into rubles at the time of writing the text - 985 p. <br><br>  I remind you that you read the blog of the company Shopozz, a free Mail Forwarding service from the USA.
