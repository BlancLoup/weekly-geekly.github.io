  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Do you have a backup plan?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  No, no, the article is not about the backup plan.  Article about the plan "B". <br>  Having succumbed to mass hysteria, I decided to go to the NPF.  (No! The article is not about APF!) <br>  I read reviews and ratings, found out that different sources without shame of conscience publish different returns on the same NPF (again distracting) ... and decided to transfer to 24 (there is no point in discussing). <br><br>  I come to the office, I sit with the coupon for 1 hour (one hour) in a queue of three people, finally I get an appointment and find out that "the system is hanging today and almost does not work."  (Here! Here is an article about this.) <br>  Well, I understand, it happens. <br>  Two days later, on this Friday, I come to another department of XXX24 and already completely without a queue I find out that the system also ‚Äúhangs and does not work‚Äù for them.  And no, without a system, they cannot accept the application. <br>  - How so?  - I say - All branches of something do not work? <br>  - On Monday everything was still working fine.  You come next week. <br>  I even thought for a minute when next week I would have the opportunity to leave work to come to the bank, but then it hit me: <br>  - You can't transfer your money to such a bank! <br><br>  No, this is not the reaction of a capricious child.  Yes, the system happens to be buggy.  But how does the bank and APF behave in this situation?  No way.  They do nothing.  They have no plan "B". <br>  Just in those days, when a surge in the activity of transfers to APF. <br>  But these are not instant translations, here the system is not needed at all.  It is enough for them to accept a statement from me with a signature, with correctly filled in requisites, with a useless photocopy of a passport and SNILS, in order to send it to a pension fund and enter it into the system. <br>  That is, somewhere in the bank sits a big man, responsible for NPF, receiving bonuses for its success, but he does not care that customers can not write statements for several days. <br>  But he could have built everyone, even sent by e-mail, or by courier, instructions for accepting statements in paper form, would have sent the forms to fill in and the procedure for how to enter them later when restoring efficiency.  It is clear, not himself, through subordinates.  But he does not do that. <br>  Can I be sure that when it will be necessary to quickly respond to changes in the market and transfer my investments from one financial instrument to another, this bank can be effective? <br>  Not.  I'm not sure. <a name="habracut"></a><br>  Do not write that investments are managed by some people, but draw up contracts - by others.  There is a guide above them.  And in this branch of management, inaction has reached the highest point and the result is that the employees did not receive plan ‚ÄúB‚Äù. <br>  None of this whole branch of executives hit the table and said: ‚ÄúYou will go to distribute newspapers on the street, if MY clients are not serviced right away.  Whatever you like, anything, anytime, but so that the applications are accepted and processed, at least flash drives with pneumatic transmission! ‚Äù <br>  Indeed, in this situation, I, as a future client of the NPF, could not even know at all that they have something buggy.  I wrote the application, submitted the documents, signed the contract.  When it got into the system - right now or they were brought to the central office and entered at night from the backup terminal - there is no difference.

      Okay, sort of let go.  Now to the analytical part: <br>  50 years ago computers were not used in everyday life.  And nothing, the business was spinning.  Banks worked, shops delivered orders, even people traded on the stock exchange. <br>  This means that in most cases an alternative process can be envisaged, which allows working in the conditions of a temporarily absent main system.  And it will not always be more expensive. <br>  Moreover: <br><br><h4>  Having an alternative process allows you to estimate the cost of system downtime. </h4><br>  And to issue the terms and conditions of compensation for such idle time.  Did you have to hire 20 couriers and pay overtime to operators to enter data after restoring the system?  No question, we subtract from the bonus fund of the unit that allowed the joint.  Not a hypothetical loss of profit, but actual expenses.  And it will not be a loss of business, but an incentive to work efficiently. <br>  Here, the truth may be that the process without a system and with acceptable quality is not worth the money that is spent on the system.  Maybe this is why IT does not like to think over plan ‚ÄúB‚Äù? <br><br><h4>  Having an alternative process allows you to evaluate the effectiveness of </h4><br>  The implementation of the process without a system allows you to adequately assess the benefits of having a system: <br>  - reduction of process costs <br>  - acceleration of the process (competitive advantage) <br>  - availability of services unattainable (really?) Without a system. <br>  - etc. <br><br>  It turns out that in the presence of the plan "B" are primarily interested not the system developers, but the business owners. <br><br>  Yes, there are operations that cannot be done without a system, but there are plenty of other cases. <br>  - Why, when the online store is buggy, I see a PHP error, and not a request to call and make an order? <br>  - Why, when the ATM does not work, they write to me ‚ÄúSorry, it does not work‚Äù, but do not show the addresses of the nearest people with the location map and telephone for customers? <br>  - Why in one bank after the loss of the database could restore all the transactions on the papers, but here, damn, can not accept the payment and put a stamp on the receipt, then just enter it with your hands? <br><br>  Disclaimer: Possible coincidence of names can be considered random, so that suddenly no one would think that I want to discredit a certain bank. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/195684/">https://habr.com/ru/post/195684/</a></p>
