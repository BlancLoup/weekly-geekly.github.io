    <a name="habracut"></a><br>  It should be immediately noted that Line Games is a rather closed area and for games that want to be published there, it has a special set of requirements, including your previous success stories and profits.  Clear preference, of course, is given to home titles, but still, publishing there is quite realistic, as Gameloft has proved to us.  So, what do you need to do so that you do not slide down the inclined one after the feature?  Let's look at the main methods of promotion in Line Games. <br><br><h5>  Lead generation with video and installation recommendations </h5><br>  Line is actively experimenting with ways of advertising inside its site.  Having implemented the Line Coins service, the messenger offers its users to install applications from the list of recommended ones for a certain amount of virtual money. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/37d/196/b3b/37d196b3b74f422d8bb54dfd24a5090c.jpg"></div><br><br>  A huge advantage of this type of advertising is the rapid growth of installations, while a significant disadvantage is the low number of returns to the game.  For example, Line Jelly, which we will discuss below, already has 10 million installations, while the number of active users is only 40,000, that is, only 0.6%.  That is why Line turned its attention to video advertising, as the most effective way to attract new users, in their opinion.  Video advertising in the format of promovideo is offered for viewing in a simple way - for ‚Äúbuns‚Äù or virtual currency. <br><br><h5>  Stickers </h5><br>  The most effective way to attract user base, as well as additional income.  For those who still do not know what it is: stickers are small animated pictures, sometimes animated, exchanged between users within a chat, expressing any emotions or whole sentences. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8d5/490/c98/8d5490c989fa45fe9c2d32e0610eadfc.jpg"></div><br><br>  They are issued in series - 10 or 20 pieces each, and can be used both in personal and in group chats.  Their cost also varies: from free to $ 2 per series.  Usually, the instant messenger itself releases the free ones, but the paid, so-called premium stickers are already released in conjunction with the companies that are advertised inside the application.  Most often these are games, big brands and stars.  They are very popular regardless of cost, and almost every episode diverges instantly through word of mouth.  This is confirmed by the figures - the sale of stickers to the Line brings the company 1 billion yen per month (or more than $ 10 million), which actually amounts to about 5 million stickers per month.  By the way, the cost of releasing stickers under the Line brand will cost $ 33,438. <br><br><h5>  Sponsored Stickers </h5><br>  Actually, these are special series of stickers, only you can download them by performing a certain action, in different messengers the actions are different.  And in the Line most often it is the installation of various mobile games, both independent developers and Line Games. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5f2/4f9/e4b/5f24f9e4b8fe4e73a6c97e34a7702a2c.jpg"></div><br><br>  The downside of this method of attracting users is that most of them are chasing after a sticker, not a game.  This trend is noticeable for Kakao Games.  Therefore, before you start a series of stickers, pay attention to your numbers on user retention. <br><br><h5>  SMM / Community Management </h5><br>  Basically, this method is reduced to the management of branded accounts.  I wrote about them in the first article about Line.  The main features of these accounts include the ability to add as a ‚Äúfriend‚Äù to all users, exchange messages and fumble content.  For the development of official brand accounts, any stimulating content is often used, as on the brand pages of Facebook or Vkontakte that we are used to, namely promotions, prizes, contests, coupons or exclusive news.  Below is an example of such activities of the official account of the game Line Jelly. <br><br>  <b>Example 1.</b> Action discounts <br><br><blockquote>  <i>The new version of LINE JELLY features an Item set Bonus.</i>  <i>Get score bonuses of up to 15% for using items!</i>  <i>The bonus rate will be!</i> </blockquote><br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7f3/953/a01/7f3953a013bb46e4bac4b64af0d559cc.jpg"></div><br><br>  <b>Example 2.</b> New combos when certain results are achieved. <br><br><blockquote>  <i>New item!</i>  <i>Easy combo</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Easy to use combos!</i>  <i>Amazing combos and incredible scores!</i>  <i>Easy combo pops up randomly before each game.</i>  <i>Don't miss it!</i> </blockquote><br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dcd/d21/ca7/dcdd21ca785c443bbab43b45ecf39521.jpg"></div><br><br>  <b>Example 3.</b> Viral marketing: the ability to share status in the game through stickers <br><br><blockquote>  <i>Let the stickers make chatting on LINE more fun!</i>  <i>LELL JELLY!</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>We hope you enjoy the new features on LINE JELLY.</i>  <i>See you again soon!</i> </blockquote><br><br>  Such marketing is primarily aimed at increasing user engagement, monetization and, accordingly, sales.  With proper SMM, taking into account the national character of the Japanese, this is the most effective method of increasing LTV, ARPU, ARPPU, etc. These game indicators are very dependent on promotions and promotions. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a6a/1a9/9b7/a6a1a99b71624ae698710dc27da085f7.jpg"></div><br><br><h5>  Mailings, PR </h5><br>  Line also offers a very effective type of marketing - sending messages from its corporate account, the number of subscribers of which is 11.6 million today. The cost of this marketing activity will cost $ 5,000‚Äì16,000 (600,000 messages).  This advertisement is quite effective, especially for returning users to the game.  It usually looks like this: <br><br>  <b>Example 1.</b> In his tape <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4c7/840/338/4c7840338ec6451d97905425211c6526.jpg"></div><br><br>  <b>Example 2.</b> Distribution of content for free, dedicated to any special event through the publication in its official blog. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1da/ab4/964/1daab4964b4a4b54a4ba4c182ec81598.jpg"></div><br><br>  <b>Example 3.</b> Video advertising official account Global Line (Youtube) <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/122/9d6/e69/1229d6e69ade493e8aa8927e35c43f0a.jpg"></div><br><br>  Video advertising is an extremely effective way to attract users to play in Japan.  Namely, with the help of advertising on TV, Puzzle &amp; Dragons attracted 2 million users per week.  For example, the publication in the official Line Global account of the video of the game Line Jelly has already collected 2.5 million views. <br><br><h5>  Content merchandising </h5><br>  It is a sale of soft toys, stickers, clothes, etc.  branded products.  This way of monetization, again, is actively used by Line, repeating the success with Rovio's Angry Birds.  For example, it is known that in July 2013 the messenger earned $ 40 million from sales of such products.  Example: cookies in the shape of the heroes of the game "Pokopang": <br><br><h5>  <b>Finally</b> </h5><br>  When deciding what opportunities to use, I advise you to build on the ultimate goals of advancement. <br>  First of all, it is necessary to pay attention to the possibility of integrating the game with the Line Games platform.  Now, for example, this platform has more than 200 million users who give an excellent start to the game when launched on the Japanese market. <br>  An additional boost of quality installations and the influx of new users are best provided by the release of sponsor stickers.  But to retain users and increase sales, the official account of the game in Line and Line Play game or interactive actions like Line Flash Sale or video advertising, which make it possible to communicate with users and engage them in interaction, work best. <br><br>  Cross-advertising in other games is also very effective, but it is very difficult to negotiate with any of the TOPs. <br>  Actually Line games - expensive, but it is worth every dollar invested.  Despite the fact that user retention is very low, in general, ARPU can be 10 times higher than your average global.  Conduct a dialogue - the Japanese are unusually sociable - and they will pay you back generously.  The main trump card of messengers is that users are already accustomed to pay and do it regularly. <br><br>  By the way, who is also interested in learning more about Kakao Games - the Korean equivalent of Line Games, here is my lecture on CasualConnect. <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/lfF6o_swgBM%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjUN5qTt2OGbxZNIOdWHBknM4TJCA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/214433/">https://habr.com/ru/post/214433/</a></p>
