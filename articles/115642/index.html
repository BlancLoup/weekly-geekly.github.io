On the example of projects that spoke, Arkady Moreynis showed the authors of the projects how to look at his idea through the eyes of business, why projects need expert help and what is common between a startup and a hamburger. <br><br>  <b>The project is a big bag.</b> <br>  The project, which has become a successful business, is similar to Big Mac.  It has a cutlet (main product / technology), an upper bun (the audience that needs this product) and a lower bun (like what problems the audience will solve the product). <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Investors and the market first want to hear from you: what you offer, to whom you offer it and how you are going to do it.  Also, going to the diner, you want to get a well-known and understandable hamburger, and not the nameless patty.

      <b>Why can not sell one "cutlet".</b> <br>  One of the projects that performed in Novosibirsk offered another service for a quick taxi call.  The cutlet in this case is the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa service that allows you to quickly find the nearest taxi.  The idea is not unique: only one Startup Weekend passed through at least 6 similar services with effective calls from taxi drivers and searching for travel companions.  None of them shot - because, apart from the technology of searching for the nearest car, the authors could not answer the question - why do users need it.  A person who does not have time to wait for a taxi goes on the road and, raising his hand, instantly catches the car - why should they waste time, look for an application in the phone, poke at the buttons and download something?  Taxis have their own control rooms, they don‚Äôt have to fool with the new equipment and your system, and so they have their own customers.  Ordinary "bombies" do not want to advertise their illegal extra money and somewhere they register - they keep their illegality. <br>  The audience is there, there are problems, but the project does not solve them - the Big Mac did not work out.  That is why none of the many taxi services so far has not taken off. <br><br>  <b>The ideas are not unique, but the authors.</b> <br>  To start a project, authors must be able not only to give birth to an idea and write code - this is only the very beginning.  The success of the next stage depends on the competences and abilities of the team.  The main work begins when you have to analyze the needs of the audience, to promote and sell their services. <br>  Therefore, Glavstart, investing in projects, gives money not for a bare idea, but, above all, for a team. <br><br>  To make a successful project, you need to turn your project from a regular cutlet into Bigmak, a sandwich with a name known worldwide.  In most cases, it is not the material from which it is made that is unique, but the seller / author, channel / audience and marketing methods. <br><br>  As a rule, projects come on Weekends without ‚Äúbuns‚Äù, with just one patty.  The task of experts who have successful experience in launching their own projects is to work out with the authors where and how to look for an audience, what problems it has and how to solve them, and, most importantly, how to attract customers and convince them of the need for your service.  If you have a bright head, you are not an experienced businessman yet, but have already realized the need to become one, the first step is Startup Weekend. <br><br>  As always, the best projects, Glavstart will offer money to bring the idea to the prototype and investment. <br><br>  You can <a href="http://startupweekend.timepad.ru/event/4559/">register at Startup Weekend in Novosibirsk as a spectator</a> , or write to us at idea@glavstart.ru and inform about your desire to take part with your project. <br>  Everything, as always, is free.  :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/115642/">https://habr.com/ru/post/115642/</a></p>
