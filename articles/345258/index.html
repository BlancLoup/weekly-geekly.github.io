I would have a gin, I would not be confused in the wires ...</i> <br><br>  We have been working in the software market for telecom operators for a long time and today we are very interested in understanding what the situation is in Russia?  What is the real number of active operators and providers?  Where are they?  Who are they? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  More than 3 years ago we were engaged in the formation of a statistical picture with telecom operators and providers in Ukraine (see <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/215259/">publication</a> ).  Some experience was gained.  His and use.

      <b>All information is obtained from open sources.</b> <br><br>  At the time of writing the article on the Roskomnadzor website, the ‚ÄúRegister of licenses in the field of communications‚Äù contains records of <b>34,703 issued licenses</b> .  This is absolutely all licenses in the field of communication.  Looking ahead, we will inform you that there are many companies here that have little connection with the communications industry, but are required to obtain licenses for their activities <i>(organizing communications at their enterprises, etc.)</i> <br><br>  This list is not too rich in information, but contains an INN of companies.  The rest has to be reloaded separately. <br><br>  First of all, we discard records where several licenses are issued for the same company.  As a result, there are <b>13,210 companies</b> . <br><br>  Further, it turns out that 476 of them are in the ‚ÄúLiquidated‚Äù stage.  So we have in the balance: <b>12734 organizations that are not closed</b> . <br><br>  We study further.  Interesting information - the date of foundation of companies. <br><br>  TOP 10: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/hw/db/gc/hwdbgcghy92nkilo_kabp2-0uis.png"><br><br>  In general, the basis of the year of the picture is as follows: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/le/ih/nt/leihntgoidhwqpwqluypsuxl10c.png"><br><br>  We use the data on the gross revenue of companies.  After all, we really need organizations.  We exclude those who were founded before July 1, 2016 and at the same time for 2015 and 2016 do not have gross revenues <i>(apparently, the company is inactive)</i> .  These are 2546 companies. <br>  There are <b>10188 companies left that operate</b> and / or were founded after 07/01/2016. <br><br>  <b>According to the data for 2016, all these companies received gross revenues in the amount of 13.963.629.708.838.00 rubles</b> .  For 2015, this figure was 14.262.475.500.196.00 rubles <br><br>  We have broken the company by revenue.  It turned out this distribution: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gm/3r/il/gm3rilphs4yfata_epbwzhfykiw.png"><br><br>  Further, we thought about what should be excluded from the sample those companies that are registered at the same address.  Most likely, in such cases, it will be a question of one business.  1106 companies were eliminated with the addresses to which other companies from the list were already listed.  Total left <b>9021 companies with their own address</b> . <br><br>  Now began the selection of companies that are still engaged in communication.  We filter on the main KVEDU.  TOP-5 of the main QUAD was as follows: <br><br><ul><li>  Activities in the field of communication based on wired technology: 2383 </li><li>  Activities in the field of broadcasting: 1172 </li><li>  Telephone service activities: 669 </li><li>  Documentary telecommunication activities: 476 </li><li>  Activities in the field of television broadcasting: 401 </li></ul><br>  We discarded everything that had little to do with the connection - such as: ‚ÄúGrowing mushrooms and truffles‚Äù, ‚ÄúAsbestos mining‚Äù, ‚ÄúBreeding pigs‚Äù, ‚ÄúCollection and treatment of wastewater‚Äù and tph. <br><br>  <b>5950 industry companies left</b> . <br><br>  Of these, by type of license, the distribution was: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gt/ja/je/gtjaje-jzb2agih7_wzc_xpkydq.png"><br><br>  But, as mentioned in the beginning, we need communication operators.  We are rejecting television, radio, ministries, limited partnerships, the Novaya Zemlya communications center, and so on. <br><br>  Received 3940 objects.  This is the final figure.  It can be said with a high degree of confidence that <b>today there are 3,940 telecom operators operating in the Russian Federation</b> . <br><br>  According to the form of organization of these companies, the situation is as follows: <br><br>  AO - 78 <br>  CJSC - 170 <br>  JSC - 32 <br>  PAO - 9 <br>  OOO - 3646 <br>  Other - 5 <br><br>  And then we took and <b>mapped all these 3940 companies at their addresses</b> . <br>  The result was a picture from the beginning of the post. <br><br>  And if someone wants to study the interactive map more thoughtfully, then here is the link on <a href="https://userside.eu/ru/publication.php%3Fpublication_id%3Doper_russia">our website</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/345258/">https://habr.com/ru/post/345258/</a></p>
