  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Anonymous comments (pros and cons)</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  At the dawn of the Internet, this kind of services flourished as ‚Äúforums‚Äù.  Hundreds of thousands of people spent an enormous amount of time there and left their thoughts there.  Absolutely everyone could become the creator of the discussion thread.  It was necessary to simply click on "New Topic" or "New Topic" in the Russian version, and now everyone is talking about the topic you set.  With the growth of the Internet and its audience, blogs and social networks began to flourish, where everyone has a ‚Äúmonopoly‚Äù on the creation of a topic, the rest remain just commentators.  Comments here are divided into two types: anonymous and comments of registered users.  Let's see which type of comments is best used for your startup or in an existing blog. <a name="habracut"></a><br>  To do this, we will separate the services by type and consider the positive and negative sides of anonymous and non-anonymous commenting. <br>  <b>News sites</b> <br>  Quite recently, probably under the influence of a blog culture that is gaining popularity, comments on each news appeared in our news sites in respected news sites.  Many believe that reading such comments is always more interesting than the articles themselves.  For example, there is the <a href="http://delfi.lv/">Delfi.lv</a> news site on the Latvian Internet ( <a href="http://rus.delfi.lv/">http://rus.delfi.lv</a> ), which has become the most popular news resource of this country by doing a simple thing - they opened anonymous commenting of news for everyone.  Those.  No one will check what you enter in the name and address field.  The simplicity of posting comments created by the creators of the site leads to the fact that comments on some news are in the thousands.  Moderation is here - it is carried out by all users, complaining about the bad comment of the administration. <br><img src="http://www.roiber.ru/img/upload/28011a879ef0aabefa0453b49dd17047.jpg"><br>  Another very popular news site in Ukraine. <b><a href="http://pravda.com.ua/">Ukrainian truth</a></b> offers to register for commenting on the news.  So, we have an order of magnitude less comments, as well as relatively more interesting discussions.  After all, they can ban them here for breaking the rules, and they will definitely not want to register again with the recognizable ‚Äúcommentator‚Äù. <br><img src="http://www.roiber.ru/img/upload/a8167a1617e50f1acc07a2349faa8323.jpg"><br><br><br>  <b>Social networks</b> <br>  Here anonymous commenting is impossible in principle.  The charter of most networks says that registrations should be carried out only under their real names.  However, the paradox of such networks, on the example of Odnoklassniki and V Kontakte, is that people forget that everything they say is recorded in their profile under a real name.  Than in the future for the participants of the networks to turn around the comments left to think is not very desirable, it‚Äôs just clear that there is nothing good.  By the way, deleting your profile in Russian networks does not delete the content of this user left throughout the network.  So the rule ‚Äúwhat is written with a pen can not be cut down with an ax‚Äù has never been more relevant. <br><img src="http://www.roiber.ru/img/upload/93eb80d8b6d08d0362a5a4fba482cfaf.jpg" width="397" height="272"><br><br>  <b>Startups, web 2.0 services, blogs</b> <br>  If you are a manufacturer of new web services, then the most interesting solution for you will be the organization of both anonymous and non-anonymous type.  For example, a recently opened startup for posting photos and videos from a mobile phone, <a href="http://cameraphoner.com/">Cameraphoner</a> allows users to comment on both registered users who just need to enter a comment, and anonymous users.  However, commenting for the anonymous author is somewhat more difficult: he needs to enter his nickname, comment text and go through the so-called ‚Äúcaptcha‚Äù check - check that you are not a spam bot or simply not a spammer who has decided to clone his comments by the hundreds.  The use of anonymous commenting here is due to the desire to increase the number of third-party comments on a not-too-visited resource.  In addition, commenting anonymously is a rule for many, such comments are often more straightforward and truthful. <br><img src="http://www.roiber.ru/img/upload/47ec013de53b5b5ff53d40c075a058dd.jpg" width="477" height="417">

      If you are a blog user on <a href="http://livejournal.com/">LiveJournal</a> or <a href="http://blogger.com/">Blogger</a> , then you have the tools to prohibit or allow anonymous comments.  The tendency here is such that the younger a blog is, the more open it is to outside opinions - anonymous comments are open here, with the increasing popularity and number of readers the blog author closes anonymous comments, as the number of inappropriate statements grows along with the blog. <br><br>  The same rule works for standalone blogs, only there is one more evil - <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trackback">Trackback</a> spam and comment spam.  There are many ways to fight, but sooner or later the blog owner comes to the conclusion that commenting allows only registered users.  Commentators, Anonymus leave the blog or silently contemplate what is happening. <br><br><img src="http://www.roiber.ru/img/upload/a0aa8cbce5d8d72a1a491f35ac9d77f7.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Corporate commentators</b> <br>  It is not a secret to anyone that many social networks today have their own social networks and blogs (especially the Microsoft Shared Point system) - they have people and resources for such innovations.  From my own experience, I can say that in such systems there is no room for the anonymus.  In one telecommunications company of Ukraine, the general director launched an anonymous questionnaire on the intranet about problems in the company.  But everyone has heard about IP logging somewhere on the Internet, i.e.  the recording of IP addresses on the forums, and the director‚Äôs initiative was 100% failed, because  few people believed that nothing under the comment is written about the author.  This suggests that anonymity is not the place in the corporate environment. <br><br>  <b>Anonymous forums</b> <br>  Such forums are a kind of Internet paradox.  They serve mainly entertainment purpose.  Users of such forums are so liberated that very often the real legends of the Internet are born in such places.  They also give birth to <a href="http://lurkmore.ru/%25D0%259C%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BC">memes</a> .  The most prominent representative of such a forum is considered <a href="http://2ch.ru/">TWO</a> .  You can read about TWICE <a href="http://lurkmore.ru/%25D0%2594%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D1%2587">here</a> . <br>  It is fair to say that they say here absolutely everything, even about what to talk about would not be worth it, but people like it.  By the way, visiting lovers of regulatory vocabulary categorically is not recommended. <br><br>  <b>Conclusion</b> <br>  Anonymous comments always have a place, but only here they are used in entertainment sites and forums.  We can definitely say that they have no place in the corporate culture.  Anonymous comments contribute to the annoying registration of many modern sites.  If anonymous comments are closed, then discussions are poorer, but often more meaningful. <br><br>  I'd like to mention the <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenID">OpenID</a> technology, which today is supported by both LJ and Yandex, and many other services and content providers.  Commenting when using OpenID becomes not anonymous, but as simple as anonymous - you register with an OpenID account provider only once (LiveJournal, My Circle, Blogger, etc.), and then having just one account, comment everywhere where OpenID is supported authentification  The benefit of such places is becoming more and more. <br><br><br>  Vyacheslav Baransky <br>  <strong>Source: <u><a href="http://roiber.ru/articles/9">Royber PC</a></u></strong> <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/26230/">https://habr.com/ru/post/26230/</a></p>
