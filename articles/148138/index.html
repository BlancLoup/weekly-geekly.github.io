  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Time sinks and the fight against them</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  It turns out that in our life, in addition to bacteria, viruses and other parasites, there is also such an infection as time scavengers.  They unceremoniously invade our lives and consume the most valuable resource - time.  And if we are well acquainted with large sinks: television, computer games, idle shopping, then we may not even suspect about small and even microscopic ones! <br><br>  Since this is an article on business, I will not tell you how to find microscopic absorbers in our daily life - let it be your homework.  I will talk about how to get rid of them your business. <br><br>  The main habitat of time sinks is business processes.  And the process is less unique - the more sinks in it.  We jokingly called the first absorber, whom I caught and eliminated in my company, with salary. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Salary</b> is a common time absorber, observed in almost any employee working with a PC.  Manifested in a meaningless viewing of the client base, client sites, lists, tables and other content.  Often causes the employee total lack of time and depression.

      Just imagine: the average manager during a working day about 200 times looks into his client base, spending 20-30 seconds at least to search for the necessary information in it - it is from 60 to 100 minutes of wasted time! <br><br>  <b>Paper</b> is the second, but no less dangerous scavenger.  It consumes employee time as easily as a sticker on your monitor is lost.  Every day, an average office employee spends 10‚Äì20 minutes of time writing office memos, about five minutes of printing documents, and another 15 minutes of searching for the necessary papers in the general stack.  We found another half hour! <br><br>  <b>There</b> are <b>distractions</b> in any office.  It is almost impossible to get rid of them - only vaccinations will help.  Distractions are fun printouts of Internet humor, orders, plans, pictures, photos hanging on the walls, hippos, kittens, stickers on the monitor and other nonsense, on which we can hold our eyes, even fish and mini-skirts!  It is difficult to calculate the time spent on them per day - for this you need to put an eye-tracker and observe the movement of the pupils. <br><br>  I dare to suggest that looking at nonsense takes 10-15 minutes a day. <br><br>  <b>Crumbs</b> appear when employees eat in the workplace.  Now I'm not talking about containers with food, which can be seen during the lunch break, but about various cookies, coffee breaks, crackers, nuts and chewing gums, which are so often found in the table with my colleagues.  When a person is chewing - he does not think, he cannot communicate with the client, his hands are busy with food, not with work.  In my office, it is forbidden to hamster anything during working hours on pain of terrible executions and executions, and the time of breaks is strictly normalized, which I advise you. <br><br>  We are approaching the most microscopic time absorbers, which are far from an easy task to track down. <br><br>  <b>Hanging pins</b> are a type of time sinks that arise due to a shortage of the Internet channel and computer performance, as well as due to various software that overloads the computer ‚Äî for example, antivirus software.  A PC user performs about 6,000 operations every day, each of which takes about half a second.  As a result, we get 50 minutes of time, which eats office computer.  By increasing the system performance, for example, 2 times - we will save another 25 minutes for an employee. <br><br>  <b>Neumeyki</b> .  Many employees simply do not know how to use shortcuts, do not know many simple and convenient functions of Excell, Word and other applications with which they work, losing precious minutes of dragging icons and mouse clicks. <br><br>  <b>Dialing</b> is not the most obvious, but very relevant, time scavenger for departments that make a large number of telephone calls.  On each dialing, you can save about five seconds of time - by properly setting up the office PBX, or simply replacing the key phone with a softphone and the analog line with VoIP telephony.  Five seconds, multiplied by two hundred calls a day, give us another 15 minutes. <br><br>  This is not all time sinks, and I will be glad if you write to me about those parasites that you found in your company.  But first, let's summarize.  Roughly summing up the numbers we get, we get the opportunity to save our employees about 150 minutes of working time each day, which will be spent on efficiencies. <br><br>  Whether you should pay attention to the sinks, decide for yourself, but 150 minutes a day multiplied by 20 working days multiplied by an average of 10 employees with an average salary of 20 thousand / month give us 62,500 rubles a month in net wage losses.  And how much money does your business generally lose? <br><br>  Any absorber is easily eliminated with the help of modern technical means, automation or a simple revision of the organization‚Äôs business processes, the elimination of atavisms that have taken root in business.  And the fight against them is the key to a significant increase in the profitability of a business, which means it is an important task for any entrepreneur. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/148138/">https://habr.com/ru/post/148138/</a></p>
