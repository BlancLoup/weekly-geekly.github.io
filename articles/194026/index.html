  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Is it "harmful" to wear glasses?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I suppose every visitor of Habr is a hyper-active computer user, and it can be safely assumed that the problem of vision in the present or the future is somehow vital for everyone reading this post.  Today I would like to expand the discussion in the comments on the relevant topic, and under the cut I will explain why I decided to do it, and why on the habr. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The story of my eye problems began in early childhood.  I think every sympathizer has ever heard about Filatov Institute in Odessa.  So, over the years, I have gathered in this institution a fat medical card, a kind of trinket ala "old-timers".  With this institution, I experienced more than one operation and hundreds of courses of treatment (the familiar children's names for "cats", "cross" and "tablets") of strabismus and astigmatism.  In the sixteenth year of life, due to the natural, natural chemical reactions in the adolescent‚Äôs body, all this was unsuccessful (well, at that time ‚Äúnot giving visible results‚Äù equated to ‚Äúunsuccessful‚Äù) treatment was sent by the forest, and I forgot about Filatov.  Problems were present all my conscious life, therefore I did not feel discomfort, I got used to perceive the world just like that, and to others I never saw it.

      But, the years flew. <br><br>  The bottom line for now is a slight converging squint, 15% on the right, 30% on the left.  Filatov and operations certainly gave their results at one time, I had a very large angle, from which there is now very little left.  But, over the years of the student‚Äôs eyesight has dropped dramatically.  Recently, headaches have begun that often accompany astematism.  At a distance of ten meters it is difficult to distinguish the face of a person, acquaintances have to be recognized by the shape of the figure, gait, gestures and voices. <br><br>  But now, the time has come to take hold of my head, and I went to the doctor (a well-known assistant professor with good reviews).  Here it should be noted separately that there were a number of reasons for this (the vision began to deteriorate, headaches appeared, I was going to get behind the wheel of a car, and I was just tired, I want to see the faces of people going to the meeting).  Of course, I expected that for treatment and maintenance I would be assigned another course, which is designed for the long term.  But we all know about such great inventions of mankind, like glasses and contact lenses, which serve to correct the vision.  As can be seen from the following number of reasons, I needed to correct my vision immediately.  Going to the reception, among other things, I expected to get a "prescription for glasses."  What was my surprise, amazement and shock when the assistant professor declared to me that it is impossible to artificially correct my vision!  As he explained to me, glasses only make things worse, I need procedures and medicines.  I was prescribed Tsiklomed, Irifrin, and some procedures (I do not remember the name, something like light-color therapy).  The following picture perfectly illustrates my emotions at that moment: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/280/6e0/c4a/2806e0c4a712680080768c63d18a5b59.jpeg"><br>  I wore glasses as a child.  In recent years, when I was still visiting Filatov, things went smoothly, and I was allowed to remove my glasses (at that time I, a child, terribly did not want to wear them for obvious reasons). <br><br>  Returning home, I got into Google.  I found whole oceans of holivars for and against glasses and lenses.  Among other things, from various sources, I learned that for the most part it is the practice of domestic medicine.  In the west, people are assigned points without a hitch, and everyone somehow lives with it.  Knowing the reputation of domestic medicine, I decided to ask the audience Habr opinion on this topic.  As you know, people gathered here smart, inquisitive, unbiased, and soberly evaluating any nonsense in the style of foil hats and cactus from the company.  What do you think, the reluctance to write glasses, also from this opera, or is there all the same common sense?  Are glasses so dangerous that they should not be worn? <br><br>  <b>UPD:</b> I draw your attention to the fact that the topic is not about how to treat this whole thing correctly.  I think everyone agrees that glasses are not a cure.  The question is, how bad is it to wear glasses, say, on the street and while driving?  Why did my doctor categorically refuse to write me points?  That is why I chose Habr, and not some medical forum.  For I want to discuss with my brothers in the code, not a purely medical effect, but the whole picture. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/194026/">https://habr.com/ru/post/194026/</a></p>
