In addition, there I understood what kind of leader I would like to become for my future employees.  I am grateful for the days I sat in the office, working as a consultant - they did not turn out to be a simple waste of time, as I imagined it at the very beginning.  This experience helped me to follow the call of the heart, bringing together and testing in practice all the elements that build the image of an ideal leader. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <i><b>Create a space for communication</b></i> .  Obviously, the first step in creating healthy relationships at work is to determine exactly how these working relationships should look from the position of manager and subordinate.  In order for an employee to become part of a team, it is not enough just to interview him and study the recommendations.  It is important that you assess the situation and how this person can fit into the structure and culture of the company.  Recently, there has been progress in creating a corporate culture and skillful selection of relevant personnel.  Often, however, one fragment falls out of the picture that could take us a step further - creating a safe place for employees to discuss their career plans with us, his employers.  Too often, we only choose at random among applicants, throwing a new employee into the company's boiler - we need to fill a vacancy, and a specialist needs a job.  In doing so, we do not understand their career goals - both short-term and long-term. <br><br>  Perhaps they want to build a long career in the company, or vice versa, to return to university and complete a master's degree, or maybe they are looking for less responsible work in order to focus on the family.  Different people have completely different ideas about their careers, but you will never understand this unless you create an open space for communication.  And this is what we have to do.  This is what trust is based on.  We must show the people who work for us, that we are not indifferent to their fate, that they are important to us not only as workers, but also as people.

      <b>The ability to listen is an art lost in our days</b> .  And I'm just as bad at this as everyone else - my friend and father, who is a lawyer, can confirm this.  Here is one of my favorite sayings of the Dalai Lama: <br><br>  <i><b>‚ÄúWhen you speak, you only repeat what you already know.</b></i>  <i><b>But when you listen, you can learn something new. ‚Äù</b></i> <br><br>  If you look at this idea from the point of view of a manager, you will see how much it will give you.  Thanks to the ability to listen and hear the people around us - our customers, suppliers, and, most importantly, colleagues - we are able to learn not only about our personal relationships with them, but also about how they perceive our company: its culture, products, employees and much more.  Others see what we do not notice. <br><br>  Want to successfully use social media for the benefit of your company?  Then stop chatting about yourself and start listening to what others are saying.  Trying to unleash another product, often you simply spray in vain, passing important pieces of information past your ears, which probably prevent purchases.  Just stop for a moment and listen ... listen carefully - to the people, to the world, to what they are saying. <br><br>  <b>Is it below your status?</b>  <b>Nonsense!</b>  Ultimately, it is extremely important to show respect and appreciation for the work that our employees do for us.  The same logic underlies the respect we have for people, not only donating money to charity, but also willing to donate their time.  This shows your diligence, and this is what your employees want - respect for them and their time they could spend elsewhere.  The next time you have the opportunity, scrub the floor, take out the trash, pick up Starbucks coffee, or run off for dinner for your entire work gang ‚Äî show them that their time is as important as yours.  Yes, just give them a day off on Friday to say: <br><br><h4>  "Thank" </h4><br>  <b><i>Time is our most precious commodity, and each of us needs to be reminded how to spend it profitably.</i></b> <br><br>  <b>Ask for help</b> .  If you don‚Äôt ask for help, you‚Äôll never get it ‚Äî not because people don‚Äôt want to help, but because they simply don‚Äôt know that you need help.  This is normal if you cannot cope with something on your own - you don‚Äôt have to do everything alone.  For this, there are team members and employees, and it turns out that if we really rely on them, our team becomes much stronger - rights and opportunities expand, in addition, it shows that you trust others what is important to you.  This is one of the great ways to build trust, as well as employee morale.  If subordinates feel that their rights and opportunities are growing, they understand that the company regards them as valuable employees.  And this is what they really need. <br><br>  These are only some fragments of the ‚Äúmagic puzzle‚Äù that helped me to interact with my employees and as a result I myself work better.  I hope my experience will help you.  Regardless of this, perhaps a good start in the work on self-improvement will ask the question: ‚ÄúWho for me is the leader from whom I learned the most from knowledge and whom I respect the most?‚Äù <br><br>  <i><b>About the author</b> : Chris Hill (Chris Hill) - an inspired leader, author, businessman.</i>  <i>He spoke twice at the TED conference in Atalanta, USA.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/292686/">https://habr.com/ru/post/292686/</a></p>
