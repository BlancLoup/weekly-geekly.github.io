Before me and my team was another technical problem.  To paint one of the products produced in our company, it was necessary to come up with a new sample.  I set this task for myself and my subordinates.  I have always practiced this approach.  Himself and all.  This brought competitive notes to the work and supported the spirit of the inventor in me. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The loading of the curing oven, in which the parts were baked, was insufficient.  And the fault was the existing linkage.  In addition to low load, they were inconvenient to use.  To insert parts into holes and get them after baking - mockery of workers.  In addition, the manufacture of the hinges required considerable labor costs.  It is flexible a corner, contact welding of these corners, puncture.  Two weeks passed after the task was announced.  My employees did not have a solution.  Bring me a blue robe, I'm going to the workshop. <br><br>  When we are looking for technical solutions, in the first place there should always be a one-word postulate - simplicity.  Awareness of this will give you great opportunities in solving technical problems.  Complicated?  Simplify.  Systems that are broken down into simple elements are easier to manage.  This rule is valid everywhere.  The ideal is not where there is nothing to add, but where there is nothing to take away.  Remember. <br><br>  Hitch

I take in my hands a complete linkage with details and take steps.  Back and forth.  So, the details touch the chest.  I fix a variety of tactile sensations.  My whole body is a bunch of sensors.  Then I turn into a detail in order to understand what is wrong from the position of an inanimate object. <br><br>  After several years of work, I realized that it was impossible to become an inventor or creator.  They need to be born.  Once at a lecture with Heinrich Altshuller (creator of ARIZ) after discussing the Table of technical contradictions, the student asked a question.  If this table is so unique and helps to solve problems, why not hang it in schools, institutes, laboratories?  Henry answered the question with a question.  If we hang various mathematical tables everywhere that exist, will there be more mathematicians in the country or even more discoveries? <br><br>  We break the task into simple elements.  Details must hang and rationally occupy the volume of the furnace.  So, we are determined with the location in space.  Having solved this, all the remaining difficulties gently exfoliate from the common task. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Problem solved</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d88/7eb/a37/d887eba379e142c69bd2a81aaad6bab7.jpg"><br><br>  The furnace load has tripled.  The contour where the part is inserted turned out to be open.  It is much more pleasant to insert a part into a rectangular groove than into a round closed hole.  50 parts are included on the hitch - exactly the box.  Now you can not consider the details when packing after painting.  One link - one box.  The linkage design is simplicity itself, a strip with grooves and nothing superfluous.  Very easy, you say.  Yes, it is, when you know the solution. <br></div></div><br>  You must understand that no tables, methods or tests will help you discover a gift in yourself.  These are only tools that are created for you and for you.  This creator himself creates the tools.  What have you created for your life?  How many people can say about you: ‚ÄúI use what he came up with‚Äù?  And if you were destined to be born as a creator, cultivate your talent in yourself, the world needs you.  And if not?  Some of the great people said: "Why, every time I just need a pair of hands, they always have a brain attached to them."  Just sell your pair of hands like us. <br><br>  I was going home after work, when the phone rang.  Called from the sales department.  The agitated voice announced that the sales plan for the next year had been set with a threefold increase.  The company is growing, agree this is a pleasant panic.  It is necessary to increase labor productivity.  I stood in anticipation of new victories.  Prepare a pair of hands for me and bring me a blue bathrobe, I am going to the workshop. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/323390/">https://habr.com/ru/post/323390/</a></p>
