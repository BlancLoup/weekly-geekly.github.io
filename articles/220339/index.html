  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Ibm and red hat</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I wear hats and overshoes.  I feel so comfortable, I feel comfortable in them - dry and warm.  Traveling around the world, I try to find a hat shop in every big city where I have to stop for more than a day.  Hat store is not just a place where they sell hats - different, good or bad, cheap or expensive.  For me, a hat shop is, first of all, the place where they sell their own hats. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/abc/a45/978/abca459788cdb6053b4d5f1e2e0472ac.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In Vienna, there is an elegant “Nagy Hüte”, in Munich - “Breiter”, in London - the stiff “Bates Hats” and the democratic “Laird &amp; Co.”  Hatters. ”  Each of these hat-houses I discovered after a special search and in each of them I bought at least one hat made by local craftsmen. <br><br>  Founded by the Magyars “Nagy Hüte” has been making hats since 1924, not so long ago they became part of the Stetson hat empire.  Since 1898 London “Bates Hats” has not changed its address on Jermyn Street, a fashionable street in the Westminster district, on which shirts, shoes and hats have been sewn since the 17th century.  Quite young (by the standards of London) “Laird &amp; Co.  Hatters doesn’t shun democratic caps and berets, but for picky customers, it holds a second store and a separate trademark - “Laird London”.  The Munich “Breiter” was founded in 1863 and today it is the business of the fifth generation of Bavarian hats, which captured a fair share of the European headgear market.

      Gathering to visit New York, I set about studying the “situation” in the “hat market” of the City of the Yellow Devil.  In total, I discovered dozens of hat shops in New York, most of which either specialized in ladies' hats or did not produce hats on their own.  And only one company - “JJ Hat Center” - met all my requirements. <br><br>  “JJ Hat Center” dates back to 1911.  Now it is a hat business, which is owned by the third generation of the O'Toole family - Aida O'Toole and her son Sean, who have led the company for the past seventeen years.  Most recently, they created a new brand “Pork Pie” and opened two new brand stores in the East Village and Brooklyn.  It is worth noting that “pork-pie” is also the name for the style of hats. <br><br>  A gamer (gambler), she is a pork-pie hat with a low cylindrical crown, the top is even, on the whole edge is tucked like a pie, hence the name (pork-pie is a pork pie).  Appeared in the middle of the XIXth century.  For many years she was the style of a city man in Britain, and she was also worn by American soldiers during the civil war.  In the XX century, it became part of jazz and blues culture.  In the late 60s, she returned to England from Jamaica along with workers who were brought in to restore the country after World War II, and became part of Ska and fashion subcultures. <br><br>  The main store and office of “JJ Hat Center” is located on 5th Avenue, between 31st and 32nd streets.  I was very surprised when I discovered that in this very place, in the same building, in 1927, the store of the company International Business Machines, the current Blue Giant, which recently celebrated the 50th anniversary of the mainframe — the most powerful and reliable serial server of the modern world IT industry. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e11/9ae/e9f/e119aee9fbf3bf33c593d50353c7381b.jpg"><br><br>  But in those distant 20s, high-performance servers in the modern sense of the word were still very far away.  In the shop in the house №310 on 5th Avenue, meat grinders, coffee grinders, recorders of called phone numbers, devices for writing to punched cards, automated mail scales were sold — everything that the company International Business Machines was doing, more recently (until 1924 years) called “Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company (CTR)”. <br><br>  Since then, of course, the building has been significantly transformed - the charming second floor, clearly visible in the photo of 1927, is no longer present; the facade is enclosed in gray marble.  But the internal staircase leading from the first floor of the store to the second one has been preserved, and the modern photo is proof of that. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/189/0d4/f23/1890d4f230662e632fee3563d5a6ddd5.jpg"><br><br>  The assortment of the store “JJ Hat Center” is huge and diverse: bowlers, fedora, pig-packs, cylinders, “artistic” berets, caps, trilbi, homburgi - of any colors and styles.  In the midst of all this diversity, I noted the Fedor hats of exceptional red color.  Red Hat - Red Hat - Formerly an IBM Store.  It all came together in my single chain.  Who knows, maybe that's why modern IBM computers are so open to working with the Red Hat Linux operating system?  How to know, how to know ... <br><br>  I did not leave empty-handed from the “JJ Hat Center” store - I became the owner (user?) Of a black pork-share, on the label of which “Made in New York” proudly flaunts. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/03d/280/f10/03d280f10fb048bcfd1baa0ac78fb91c.jpg"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/220339/">https://habr.com/ru/post/220339/</a></p>
