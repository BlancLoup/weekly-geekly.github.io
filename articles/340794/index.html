It's time to talk about the formats.  In addition to the presentations, there will be apartment visitors (this kind of discussion panels) and workshops.  Today we will talk about workshops, and immediately the main thing - visiting workshops does not require any additional payments and is available on a regular participant ticket.  Yes, just like that. <br><br>  At workshops you will learn about hacker low-level optimization techniques, learn how to work with Web Audio API and 3D on Canvas, learn how to make your web applications native to iOS, Android, Windows and MacOS using Ionic (Angular) and build a production-ready backend on Node.js from scratch. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  <a href="https://2017.frontfest.ru/lecture/16/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dnews%26utm_campaign%3Dworkshop">¬ß Twin-stick Shooter from scratch // Mathieu 'p01' Henri</a> </h2><br><img width="250" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/e4/3b/59e43b04e62c2945555950.jpeg" alt="Mathieu 'p01' Henri">  What you need to know about the speaker?  He is French and his name reads "Henri."  Henri works in the Norwegian office of Microsoft, and before that he worked for a long time in Opera Software. <br>  In addition, Henri is an active participant in <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2594%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2586%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0">Demoscene</a> - a community of people who program as an art form and create scene programs in which they build a video series with real-time music output from a computer.  Here is <a href="http://www.p01.org/VOLTRA/VOLTRA.htm">an example of a</a> classic demoscene on JS (attention, sound).

      Henri creates incredible things.  Here are some examples from his personal blog: <br><br><ul><li>  The game " <a href="http://www.p01.org/JS1K_2015_impossible_road/js1k_impossible_road.htm">Impossible Road</a> " on JS weighing 1Kb (carefully, you can stick) </li><li>  <a href="http://www.p01.org/wolf1k/js1k.htm">Wolfenstein</a> based <a href="http://www.p01.org/wolf1k/js1k.htm">mob</a> , also 1Kb JS </li><li>  Dynamic <a href="http://www.p01.org/minami_district/MINAMI_DISTRICT.unpacked.htm">panorama of the</a> city, 1Kb </li></ul><br>  At his workshop, Henri will tell and show how you can use the imperfections of some specifications to increase performance, as well as how to stop being afraid of mathematics and begin to understand it intuitively.  The workshop will be useful to anyone interested in canvas graphics, low-level optimizations and <acronym>golf coding</acronym> . <br><br>  In addition, do not miss the ‚Äú <a href="https://2017.frontfest.ru/lecture/15/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dnews%26utm_campaign%3Dworkshop">Code &amp; Art</a> ‚Äù talk, in which Henri will tell a useful theory and collect a small audio-visual demo right on the stage. <br><br clear="all"><h2>  <a href="https://2017.frontfest.ru/lecture/39/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dnews%26utm_campaign%3Dworkshop">¬ß Node.js Backend // Franziska Klingner</a> </h2><br><img width="250" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/e4/3b/59e43baca8f6f030624136.jpeg" alt="Franziska Klingner">  In the past, Franziska Klinger was a physicist and was engaged in statistical analysis and probabilistic modeling of complex systems at the Max Planck Institute in Germany.  After some time, Francis discovered a new area for herself, where she found her application to her complex tasks and love of programming - web development.  Now Francis is working in Frankfurt and is developing microservices for the Node.js / Go + Docker bundle, while on the front end he prefers Angular over React. <br>  At FrontFest, Francis will conduct a workshop on Node.js service deployment for the battle.  Starting from the basic prototype, you will configure configuration management, query monitoring, log and user metrics collection, get acquainted with best practices and useful tools. <br><br clear="all"><br><h2>  <a href="https://2017.frontfest.ru/lecture/25/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dnews%26utm_campaign%3Dworkshop">¬ß Six Apps - One Code With Angular // Sani Yusuf</a> </h2><br><img width="250" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/ee/24/59ee2416602e8764660055.jpeg" alt="Sani yusuf">  Sani Yusuf is the author of books and <a href="https://www.lynda.com/Ionic-tutorials/Ionic-3-0-Mobile-App-Developers/562260-2.html">online courses</a> , as well as the founder of London-based Haibrid.  Basically, the company teaches and advises on <a href="https://ionicframework.com/">Ionic</a> .  Ionic is an open source SDK for creating hybrid mobile and desktop applications on web technologies.  Under the hood SDK AngularJS, SASS and Apache Cordova.  In November we are waiting for Sani at FrontFest with a report and a workshop.  At the workshop, Sani will show how to stop worrying about operating systems, devices, and screen sizes and focus on translating your ideas.  However, no one will tell about the speech better than the author himself. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Video invitation from sledge</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6QXMsIDKF3g" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div></div><br>  Who will be interested in a workshop?  Of course, those who are engaged in the development of Angular, as well as interested in the topic of PWA.  For people working with React Native, it will be helpful to learn more about alternative approaches to developing hybrid applications.  The workshop is definitely not to be missed by people who are interested in creating desktop applications on Electron, and even more so - people who are familiar with Ionic and want to upgrade their skills. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/e7/ea/59e7eaeeef1f7643923315.jpeg"><br><br>  To get to the workshops, register on the site, pay for participation in the conference and that's it.  You will have access to the main streams with reports, workshops and homestairs (we will tell about them in the next article).  Please note - all workshops will be in English. <br><br clear="all"> <a href="https://2017.frontfest.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dnews%26utm_campaign%3Dworkshop"><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/ee/cf/59eecf9b47be9508725118.png"></a> <br><br clear="all"><br>  <i>By the way, we have already written about the reports in the section <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/2gis/blog/340156/">JAVASCRIPT</a> , <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/2gis/blog/339708/">VYORSTKA</a> and <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/2gis/blog/339212/">MIX</a> .</i>  <i>And between times found out <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/2gis/blog/340440/">how the front-endanger lives in Spotify</a> .</i>  <i>Read, it's interesting there.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/340794/">https://habr.com/ru/post/340794/</a></p>
