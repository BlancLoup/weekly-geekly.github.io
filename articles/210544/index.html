In this article, we will fundamentally try to avoid names and names, and focus on the idea itself. <br><br>  We are all accustomed to, that remote maintenance has become the de facto standard for many services, and this is understandable, because we are talking about a more rapid response for the end user, on the one hand, and lower costs - on the other. <br><br>  We are faced with the fact that working with advertisers in print media is set, as they say, ‚Äúin the old manner‚Äù.  Everything is basically tied to specific advertising managers with minimal automation - mainly, these are Excel labels and documents arranged in daddies.

      In order not to reinvent the wheel, we looked at the successful automation of the areas closest in meaning and business processes.  The closest to print advertising on the Internet - the media.  But it is automated, from our point of view, rather badly - there still exists a large percentage of manual work and manual coordination. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  The key difference between media advertising on the Internet and advertising in print media is the number of degrees of freedom in determining advertising campaign and materials.  In print, the number of options is of course small (the types of advertising positions in the same magazine are always the same, the placement conditions rarely change, the technical requirements for layouts generally do not change and depend more on the equipment), whereas in the Internet media there are many variables ( Tens and hundreds of options for advertising positions, placement dates, targeting, technical requirements, target audience, etc.). <br><br>  Those.  print advertising is a bit simpler and a bit different.  In the print edition, all the conditions are fixed in advance: printed and nothing changes.  Plus, the placement options vary significantly less than on the Internet. <br><br>  The closest example of good automation on the Internet is contextual advertising.  Given that contextual advertising on the Internet has a higher level of flexibility compared to print (in parameters such as the demographics of the target audience, the number of impressions, the method of pricing for impressions / clicks, etc.) and there is the ability to customize advertising campaigns " on the fly, content management solutions are well automated.  At the same time, in contextual advertising, initially everything was built on the principle of automating services with typical stages: <br><br><ol><li>  Check in. </li><li>  Personal Area. </li><li>  Terms of placement. </li><li>  Content Management. </li><li>  Manage placement, frequency, audience, etc. </li><li>  Statistics. </li></ol><br>  In other words, everything that was possible to automate was initially automated, the work and the adoption of minor decisions were shifted to the advertiser as much as possible. <br><br>  Let's transfer this experience to print media and to remote servicing of their advertisers. <br><br>  Why is this possible and why is it necessary? <br><br><ol><li>  Requirements for publishing content in a publication are usually standard and well described.  For example, within the framework of a contract, it is prescribed clearly ‚ÄúThe volume of the text of the advertising message for publication in the Journal is not more than 2000 characters, taking into account the spaces.  Text file is provided in MS Word format.  The illustrations are in print quality (JPEG resolution 300dpi, CDR, AI). ‚Äù </li><li>  The list of services, cost, possible placement options are also formalized and listed on several numbers of printed media ahead.  So, it is well algorithms and automated. </li><li>  As part of the sale and preparation of print advertising there is a decent amount of manual work, for example, on drawing up a contract, additional agreement, agreeing materials, calculating several placement options, etc., which can be done in fully automatic or semi-automatic mode. </li></ol><br>  It is important to note that this is not about a complete replacement of sales managers and avoiding individual work.  On the contrary, it is a question of freeing unproductive time of managers, because the systems or the clients themselves can do most of the work for them.  This will allow focusing specifically on individual work with advertisers and the development of the client base. <br><br>  A good example of successful automation are managers and moderators of promotions in social networks.  After the client has independently decided on the parameters of his advertisement, certain issues, such as moderation of layouts, are processed manually, but until this point the manager‚Äôs intervention is not required. <br><br><h5>  How to approach automation? </h5><br>  Look at the print media, their IT systems and work with advertisers in detail. <br><br>  The accounting system that underlies the business automation is usually 1C UPP ‚ÄúAdvertising Management for Printed Media PROF‚Äù.  It has everything you need for conducting core activities - contractors, a directory of services, a placement plan, billing, income accounting, etc.  And to replace it with some other solution does not make much sense. <br><br>  Advertising managers have regular customers who give the main income, and they also occupy the main working time.  Standard agreements are negotiated with advertisers, a placement plan is negotiated, price offers are clarified, specialized offers are made, etc.  Each manager leads an individual client in the way he is accustomed to and in the way historically developed, taking into account, of course, the requirements of a particular publisher. <br><br>  If you look at new customers who come themselves, it usually starts with a call or letter to the advertising department.  The client gets to one of the managers and with him, in fact, begins individual work on the process described above. <br><br>  We will not evaluate whether it is good or bad.  So there is, the specialized divisions of publishing houses work quite successfully, and it‚Äôs not for us to teach them. <br><br>  <b>The idea we want to discuss with the habrasoobschestvom - Portal for remote maintenance of advertisers.</b> <br><br>  We propose to take all the best from Internet solutions, integrate with already used 1C, automate routine operations and provide all participants in the process with simple and transparent tools for collaboration. <br><br>  The process involving the portal looks like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f34/242/67b/f3424267b160f77d27cf717842d2e009.png"><br><br><ul><li>  The signed Agreement, Agreements and Acts are also laid out in the form of scans on the portal, and the amounts are marked as activated. </li><li>  All history, all documents, all advertising materials, all payments and acts are available in the personal account.  Those.  The advertiser sees the full picture of working with the media, and the manager coordinates everything electronically. </li></ul><br>  Eventually: <br><br><ul><li>  For publication.  We significantly reduce the burden on advertising managers and shift the main work either to the portal or to the advertiser himself.  This allows you to focus on individual work and the development of your clients.  Additionally, the entire history of the work of managers is recruited and coordination is added between them in terms of working with counterparties, a placement plan and promotional materials. </li><li>  For the advertiser.  A single window of work with the publication appears, he sees all his advertising materials, costs, legal documents and the full history of the relationship. </li></ul><br><br><h5>  Conclusion </h5><br>  We had a little analytical work described above.  Plus, with this idea, we entered the market and offered it to several of our potential and existing customers.  There is interest, there is a technical opportunity for implementation, we plan to start the project. <br><br>  Question to habrabschestvu - maybe we misunderstand something?  Perhaps there are already proven solutions?  Brief market research did not reveal such solutions. <br><br>  And the second question to the respected media participants: what features would you like to have on your mobile phone / tablet?  We clearly understand that the world is mobilized at an accelerated pace and, for sure, it makes sense to think over the issues of future integration with the mobile application. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/210544/">https://habr.com/ru/post/210544/</a></p>
