  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Russian e-commerce through the eyes of researchers: buyers vs sellers</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Regular researchers dared to make timid attempts to study the mysterious Russian soul, which wanders around the Internet in search of happiness.  But since for many the concept of ‚Äúhappiness‚Äù includes the material component, users of the RuNet rush to online stores, where there is ‚Äúeverything‚Äù.  And immediately.  However, not all admit that they are only looking.  Therefore, retailers often complain that they are not actively buying their products.  That is why the work of researchers becomes ungrateful, and instead of honors they receive complaints for unreliability. <br><br>  During the research, <a href="http://www.nielsen.com/ru/ru.html">Nielsen</a> concluded that 9 out of 10 Russian Internet users make online purchases. <br><br>  89% of Russian Internet users periodically make online purchases.  The remaining 11% use the Internet exclusively to access information about products, which they then buy in offline stores. <a name="habracut"></a>

      The company's analysts analyzed the activity of 500 Russians from August to October 2015 and made the above generalization. <br><br>  According to Nielsen, clothing (64%) and consumer electronics (50%) remain the most popular product categories in Russian online commerce.  The least popular are online purchases of packaged food products (12%) and alcohol (8%). <br><br>  6% of those surveyed said they only shop in foreign online stores. <br><br>  It also turned out that 70% of consumers pay for goods in cash upon receipt, and only 47% with a debit card;  45% - through electronic payment systems.  In the world, analysts said, cash payment to the courier is not very popular: 36% of consumers use this method on average, in France - 8%, in Germany - 12%, in the UK - 16%, and in Spain - 22%. <br><br>  But not all participants of the Russian e-commerce market agree with the results of the research. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.svyaznoy.ru/">Svyaznoy has</a> calculated that only every second Internet user in Russia makes online purchases, and a significant portion of online store customers are concentrated in Moscow, St. Petersburg and other major Russian cities.  In <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25AF%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA%25D1%2581.%25D0%259C%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582">the Yandex.Market, the</a> publication also commented that the Nielsen data are similar to those of the capital and million-plus cities, and in the regions, purchases over the Internet may be less popular, Kommersant <a href="http://www.kommersant.ru/doc/2902131">reports</a> . <br><br>  In another study (prepared by <a href="http://www.datainsight.ru/">Data Insight</a> and the <a href="http://www.ruward.ru/">Ruward</a> project), it was not online shoppers that were analyzed, but Internet retailers. <br><br>  The Kommersant <a href="http://www.kommersant.ru/doc/2902246">publication has published the</a> rating of the most successful online stores.  The main selection criteria were turnover and the number of orders. <br><br>  The first place in the ranking was the <a href="http://wikishopping.ru/automagaziny/364-exist">Exist.ru</a> auto parts <a href="http://wikishopping.ru/automagaziny/364-exist">store</a> with a six-month turnover (for 6 months of 2015 from January to June) of 35,700 million rubles, with 4150 orders for the specified period and an average daily check of 8,600 rubles, Firrma reports . <br><br>  The second place is at <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25AE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D1%2582">Yulmart</a> .  His six-month turnover in the first half of 2015 amounted to 15,900 million rubles, with the number of orders - 2,550 and an average daily check of 6,200 rubles. <br><br>  In third place is the <a href="https://www.wildberries.ru/">Wildberries</a> online retailer with a turnover of 14,000 million rubles and the number of orders in 9,650 - also from January to June 2015. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/a1e/043/0ba/a1e0430ba668faa6db3c9b4748397888.png" alt="image"><br><br>  On January 25, the Cyber ‚Äã‚ÄãMonday campaign <a href="https://megamozg.ru/post/23634/">was</a> held in the open spaces of Runet.  It was attended by over 100 domestic online stores, including some of the retailers mentioned above. <br><br>  The total sales turnover amounted to approximately 9 billion rubles, which is slightly less than the expected amount of 11.5 billion.  As the president of the Association of Internet Commerce <a href="http://www.akit.ru/">Companies</a> ( <a href="http://www.akit.ru/">ACIT</a> ), the campaign allowed the stores to get more buyers. <br><br>  At the same time, as <a href="http://www.rbc.ru/technology_and_media/26/01/2016/56a755139a794740ccd786e7">shown by</a> the RBC survey, many owners of online stores, who took part in the action, are disappointed with the event, as they expected sales growth several times. <br><br>  Buyers also recorded complaints about the unfair behavior of stores, technical problems and the lack of goods. <br><br>  Will the online store audience grow significantly after such ‚Äústocks‚Äù?  So far there is no definitive answer, but there is a topic for the next research. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/298254/">https://habr.com/ru/post/298254/</a></p>
