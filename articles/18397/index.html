Maybe Vinduzyatniki so intimidated, that they are afraid to admit: D <br>  And you know, I would live quietly, live with my XP, if it were not so curious.  That's interesting to me, what kind of Linux is this? <br>  The only thing that kept me off for a couple of months was long conversations with comrades, frightening by the fact that ‚Äúeverything is through run and you need to know a bunch of commands‚Äù. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Lyrical digression <br>  I do not have a buggy Windows, it does not give errors, maybe because it is licensed (ah-ah), errors and glitches appear only when I "torment" it.  Who among us does not like the reset button?  =).  I also stopped tormenting viruses, I have a new provider (I used to have dialup), and Avast is silent and only quietly updated.  So basically, I‚Äôll live on Windows and live ... if ... <br><br>  If <br>  ... We did not develop the LIME, which it was decided to make "cross-platform."  Why in quotes?  Because it will run on Linux, but with the help of Vine, and you can test it only by installing a system for yourself. <br>  ... Free  I like the concept of open source and freebies, but as a user, and not as a programmer / developer (as I said, ugh). <br>  ... I was dissuaded by Bobs, in that there was no run there for a long time, take ubuntu, it is almost Windows, you only need to know a couple of commands. <br>  ... Again, my curiosity. <br><br>  Selection <br>  Another difficulty - a large number of assemblies.  But still there are several leaders. <br>  Again, Bobs advised Runtu, I even agreed with the distributor in Astrakhan, and then it turned out that she weighs 2 gigas and will not fit on a CD, even though you are cracked.  And my sidyuk, even if it is cracked, there will be no DVD reading.  From Runtu.org spread to ru.Ksubuntu, which weighed less and fit, but it turned out to be ‚ÄúShit‚Äù, because on Ubuntu 7.04. <br>  In the end, they began to select for the parameters that are available - the size of ~ 700 mb, Russian, under my hardware (in particular, 256 mb of RAM).  And picked up.  Xubuntu. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/ru/4/43/Xubuntu_logo.png" hspace="10" vspace="10"></div>

      I started to download ksubuntu, with its mega speed and downloaded exactly in a day.  Mandrazh.  I write down the image, almost counting out every percent, get out of Windows, bios, CD first, it starts ... Ksubuntu!  Install ... Russian, Moscow ... <br><br>  In fact, everything is very simple, there is an installer there that my cat (which I don‚Äôt have :-() could use. You will be asked, they will explain you, they will thank you, and in the meantime you can play Suduku (by the way why SudUku?) or chess. <br>  This is great friends.  I do not urge you to install Linux on your own, I tell you that there is nothing difficult in this, at least when installing Xubunt, and as an alternative AXIS (for me at the moment), Xubuntu, Ubuntu and Linux are different.  You can call a bunch of things that I would like to see in XP ... <br><br>  Difficulties <br>  The only difficulty I have is setting up the Internet.  And that, in its own stupidity.  There are many articles on the Internet, I seem to have done everything correctly, but there is no connection, habrahabr.ru does not open, then I remembered that I need to add pppoe, before login, and everything worked.
