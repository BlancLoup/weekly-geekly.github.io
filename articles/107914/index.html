But still, after all ... Well, this is wrong, from whatever side you look.  It can be attributed to the lack of professionalism of journalists (but not every time!), You can try to explain that we do not invest a lot of money in self-promotion, or even just believe that aliens arrived and erased from the head of the writing brotherhood all the information related to Opera in some way.  Why?  The same explanation.  And it is easy to check - you just need to drive the authors of articles on issues of musical tastes, and if it turns out that a person knows absolutely nothing about opera music as an art form - for sure, the aliens flew.  One thing is not clear: what did they, the alien minds, Opera not pleased ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In general, the reason for such an intriguing introduction (it is necessary to somehow revive the topic that has slandered one‚Äôs teeth, otherwise the reader will simply fall asleep from boredom) this is another blog article in Computerra under the ingenuous title <a href="http://blogs.computerra.ru/2354">‚ÄúGoogle Chrome learns to block Flash‚Äù</a> .  Well, Chrome can only be congratulated - another good browser on the market is only a plus for users, but the author of the article can be congratulated only with sclerosis or at least with a superficial immersion into the topic. <br><br>  In the text of the article, the author walked along such a well-known (though not always the most popular in Russia) browsers, forgetting only Internet Explorer (which is forgivable - the ‚Äúdonkey‚Äù is still too far from the real Internet technology life) , and about Opera (which is not at all happy).  Briefly (after all, the author apparently got acquainted with his sister of talent at one of the journalistic parties) and with taste told about the presence of extensions responsible for ‚Äúcutting‚Äù flash content available in other browsers, he dwelt on how much better and the life of Chrome users will become more fun very soon, with the release of the next version of the Google browser. <br><br>  But then - as a rapid break of thought, on takeoff, so to speak.  At least one paragraph of the text simply disappeared (after all, I am inclined to the version about aliens - very much in their style: bang - and there is no information in the writer's head. Even our special services have not yet learned so).  And in this paragraph with no less positive part, the author could tell (oh, if the aliens did not interfere), that even more than one and a half years ago, in Opera 10 there was such a function called Turbo, one of which subfunctions was already blocking flash -content and launch it only with the explicit approval of the user:

    <img src="http://files.myopera.com/IlyaShpankov/files/opera-flash.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  At the same time, in the options opera: config, there was also a setting for the <b>Enable On Demand Plugin</b> - enabling the plug-in upon user request, which allowed commanding flash content of pages without the participation of Turbo: <br><br><img src="http://files.myopera.com/IlyaShpankov/files/opera-flash1.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Also further (until the alien monsters have been rubbed) was the line that in Opera 11 this function has already moved to the standard settings for the notorious ‚Äúregular user‚Äù: <br><br><img src="http://files.myopera.com/IlyaShpankov/files/opera-flash2.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  And finally, as a dessert, it was mentioned that, in general, this Opera browser was the first to include this option in the regular set of its functions, and not in the form of some kind of extension that still needs to be found and installed (and for In general, I began to simply ask myself: is there such an extension that will turn off the flash? But many people simply don‚Äôt ask). <br><br>  Of course, one could try to reason so that, for example, the function of enabling flash on demand in Opera was only a small part, a modest function of a large and eclipsing everything and everything technology called Turbo, but for other browsers this functionality is already by itself a great achievement and worthy of special mention with the singing of dithyrambs ... But we are serious people, so we don‚Äôt believe in such tales.  Here it is necessary to deal with the alien mind, not otherwise ... </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/107914/">https://habr.com/ru/post/107914/</a></p>
