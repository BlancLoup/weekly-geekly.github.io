One of the most spectacular is the birth and death of stars. <br>  Thanks to the progress, a person can take part in the life of a new class of space objects - supernova short-lived stars. <br>  1. Open the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HHYxDVqVouMC94L2hGWct1RC5QE1co_7Bev3TmuwzJQ/edit">text file</a> .  File name: free phone number.  Call the star! <br>  2. We observe the birth, short life and death of a star at the address indicated in the second line of the file. <br>  3. At the end of the text appears the last digit of the phone number from which the star managed to fight back. <br><br>  Notes. <br>  1. To increase the bandwidth of the call beats off - it is free. <br>  2. The full number is not displayed. <br>  3. Any SMS is shown as a full stop.  Write any desire, all messages are burned in a star and may be fulfilled!  Due to the delay in delivery, it is difficult to understand the authorship, so the number digit is not shown.  But there will be a real starfall - a triple flash!  SMS is charged as regular messages, but you can not enrich the cellular operator by sending them over the Internet. <br>  4. In reality, when a real ‚ÄúStar‚Äù flies in Space, a person will see a flash simultaneously with the ‚Äúhang up‚Äù signal on the phone.  When watching a webcast, the video comes with a slight delay due to the low speed of the communication channel. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ad6/4a1/bbc/ad64a1bbc919498786c603f6b10699e3.gif"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The idea arose several years ago and gradually grew to a working breadboard called the ‚ÄúStar‚Äù. <br>  A video of star flashes in space and the process of creating a layout are shown in the movie ‚Äú <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DThtFgUywBl4">Light Your Star!</a>  "

At that time there were no microcontrollers, Tsiolkovsky only developed theories of flights into space, and therefore Mayakovsky told about the idea in a poetic form: <br>  <i>Listen up</i> <i><br></i>  <i>In principle, After all, if the stars are lit -</i> <i><br></i>  <i>does that mean someone needs it?</i> <i><br></i>  <i>So - someone wants them to be?</i> <i><br></i>  <i>So - someone calls these pearls pearl?</i> <i><br></i>  <i>And, straining</i> <i><br></i>  <i>in blizzards of afternoon dust,</i> <i><br></i>  <i>breaks in to god</i> <i><br></i>  <i>afraid of being late</i> <i><br></i>  <i>crying</i> <i><br></i>  <i>kisses his sinewy hand,</i> <i><br></i>  <i>asks -</i> <i><br></i>  <i>so that there must be a star!</i>  <i>-</i> <i><br></i>  <i>swears -</i> <i><br></i>  <i>will not transfer this starless flour!</i> <i><br></i>  <i>And then</i> <i><br></i>  <i>walks alarming</i> <i><br></i>  <i>but calm outwardly.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Says to someone:</i> <i><br></i>  <i>‚ÄúAfter all now to you nothing?</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Not scary?</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Yes?!"</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Listen up</i> <i><br></i>  <i>After all, if the stars</i> <i><br></i>  <i>lit -</i> <i><br></i>  <i>does that mean someone needs it?</i> <i><br></i>  <i>So - it is necessary</i> <i><br></i>  <i>so every evening</i> <i><br></i>  <i>over the roofs</i> <i><br></i>  <i>lit at least one star ?!</i> <br><br>  And now, almost 100 years have passed, the dream of Mayakovsky is close to realization. <br>  A star is a device containing a cellular modem, a controller, and a flash ‚Äî a bell indicator. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/48e/8a3/fcf/48e8a3fcf8e3459aa4c80a2eb2e57ebe.jpg"><br><br>  It can be placed anywhere and anyone can call the star.  Like many modern people-stars, she behaves in an appropriate way: beats off calls and SMS from annoying admirers, flashing every time with joy. <br><br>  The idea was sent to the competition described in the article ‚ÄúA <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/glavstart/blog/150921/">million-dollar startup</a> ‚Äù. <br>  In this competition, surely there were many inhabitants of the planet Habr, so it is interesting to find out how everything was with them. <br>  The official result with the list of winners is still not visible, although they promised until October 15. <br>  My result: another not won international competition.  The phrase ‚ÄúDo not amuse yourself with illusions!‚Äù Was again confirmed. There is nothing to boast about, so this story is about another unsuccessful performance. <br>  ‚Äú <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/144252/">Pulsed electrolysis at the Google Science Fair</a> ‚Äù was done by my daughter, now it's my turn. <br>  As a rule, the competition is the result of some activity.  To offer something, you need it to be something already. <br>  Therefore, it is necessary to study, study and study again, and then work, work and work - this is what one famous grandfather said. <br>  In general, this project of startups (I don‚Äôt like this foreign word, even Word turns red when it is written) two projects were sent: ‚ÄúLamp &amp; Ray Time‚Äù and ‚ÄúLight your Star‚Äù.  The competition is American, so forgive me for my english. <br>  ‚Äú <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1yfBDskQpzSIY5Hsiw3vsdaGUYu9DlcbMxiBYTg4UvEE/edit">Lamp &amp; Ray Time</a> ‚Äù - the development of the idea of ‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄúThe Lamp of Time‚Äù.  From the newcomer were presented photos of the time ray in Paris, work on a spacecraft and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DVw2FRcKXqMY">video of the monochromatic version of</a> ‚ÄúThe Lamps of Time‚Äù on the Moon.  This is also an interesting direction, but not the topic of today's story. <br><br>  In the project ‚ÄúLight your Star‚Äù it was proposed to place a star on a spaceship. <br>  As it should be, the application form was filled out, with links to the Executive Summary (project summary, if I understood correctly) and the presentation ‚Äú <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1JLlfWmlcVxHkJbJVsRIPIOAfARBg1WpXTSGKgESpG4M/edit">Light your Star</a> ‚Äù. <br>  By immodest calculations, the implementation of this idea produced a good profit, which was supposed to be spent on the development of space programs. <br>  Figures for comparison: <br>  1. The creation of the rover "Curiosity" has been spent about $ 2.5 billion. <br>  2. The NASA contract with SpaceX provides for 12 flights to the ISS, with a total cost of $ 1.6 billion. <br>  3. A380 liner costs about $ 390 million. <br><br>  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe star is elementary and not expensive, so it can be implemented in one of the nearest expeditions visiting the ISS. <br>  The power station allows you to easily provide the star cosmic (solar, that is, stellar) energy. <br>  This little asterisk will unite romantics and realists, lyricists and physicists, and will also allow to collect money (which modern managers like) for the development and popularization of space research (which ordinary people like it). <br><br>  Such a cosmic star will be convenient for the fulfillment of any dream.  A wish is made, dialing is made, and then everything is as in antiquity.  Result: ‚Äúdreams come true‚Äù not only at Gazprom. <br>  Automating the execution of a dream will not wait for the arrival of the stargazing period.  You can see the cherished flash in the nearest cloudless night.  Not so romantic, but practical. <br>  It is very convenient to give a flash of a supernova to a loved one - the result of the focus is guaranteed.  At the same time studying the trajectory of the spacecraft. <br>  For children, the idea is interesting in that it will contribute to the independent study of astronomy, since it was canceled at school, and there are few scientific and educational programs on television. <br><br>  Anyone can try to test this idea right now. <br>  There is no familiar astronaut in orbit, <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/153889/">Takushi Tanaka</a> will not have time to change the firmware of his device, so there are no flashes from space.  But with the help of an Internet broadcast, it will be possible to watch flashes from the layout location, and in the file that is shared, you can see the last digit of the number of the called phone. <br>  Since free resources are used, it is not known whether the experiment will last for a couple of days, but in a real incarnation the star should have a high survivability and reliability. <br><br>  Collecting money for calls during testing on the layout will not be.  SMS is paid, but you can not send them. <br>  Since the call instantly beats off, the system capacity must be extremely high, about 20 ... 30 people will be able to call per minute. <br>  With this option are checked in work with a large load: <br>  - mobile operator; <br>  - Google documents in multi-user access; <br>  - channel video; <br>  - cellular modem and controller. <br><br>  It is interesting to see what the text will be as a result of the collective creativity of many people. <br>  Uncle Fyodor, the dog and the cat from Prostokvashino also jointly wrote a letter to father and mother. <br>  In our case there will be only numbers.  And if you translate them into notes or a picture, as suggested in one interesting <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/142830/">article</a> ? <br>  Can someone print the text presented in the film about the project? <br><br>  In the future, the star can be implemented on a smartphone as a program that instantly beats the call and produces a flash on the screen.  Programmers can do this pretty quickly. <br>  The idea can be used in various games and controlled toys.  For example, it will be interesting to put a star on the top of a city spruce on the New Year holiday.  The device turns out to be cheap, calls to it are free - people have fun. <br><br>  Interesting was the work on the implementation of the star layout. <br>  Directly the embodiment of ideas in iron took several evenings of work due to the fact that there were ready-made developments. <br>  The scheme is assembled on a slightly reworked board from the ‚Äú <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/135806/">Lamp of Time</a> ‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4f5/5fb/448/4f55fb44829b4c3c9369e81f7d95306b.jpg"><br><br>  The program for processing messages arriving via RS-232 is taken from the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/145397/">GPS clock</a> , the processing of a phone number is from a cellular security alarm device (no description yet). <br>  Cellular modem ‚ÄúFastrack M1306‚Äù is used from a long-forgotten development. <br>  Some money was put into the account: 300 rubles, which should be enough for a long time, since the tube does not rise. <br><br>  <b>Underwater rocks.</b> <br>  Strongly worried about the behavior of the modem and the cellular operator in moments of heavy workload. <br>  When a person took the line when dialing, for the next caller, it will be busy.  As a result, the exchange of the modem and operator with service SMS of the ‚ÄúYou are such a subscriber called‚Äù type begins.  The situation will increase the number of flashes of the star, but it makes the modem more and more inaccessible for calling people. <br>  It was possible to get out of this situation relatively easily.  After a short conversation with the operator, the service ‚ÄúYou have been called!‚Äù Was turned off and interfering SMS ceased to exist. <br><br>  Next surprise: switching the active window on the computer.  For the numbers to always be printed, the text box must be active.  During the tests, there was a case when the antivirus program happily announced that several new updates had been installed.  At the same time, the window of the notification service offered to protect itself and its family with the help of the new version and was set on top of all windows, becoming active.  The focus from the text editor disappeared, and the keyboard began to idle.  This point should be taken into account and should be deleted. <br><br>  When typing numbers, a checkbox appears with the name of my account, which is also not at all interesting.  A little imagination, Google's generosity, the fabulous spell ‚Äúsim salabim akhalai makhalai‚Äù and here you are: checkbox ‚Äúyour last digit‚Äù. <br>  Sometimes, when the Internet is running, there is no connection with Google documents, but fortunately, it is automatically restored. <br><br>  Most of the time was taken by two new (for me) directions: <br>  <b>1. Work with USB port.</b> <br>  Entering into the computer the last digit of the telephone number of the caller is implemented by simulating pressing a USB keyboard.  The keypad is controlled by a modem with a controller, which isolates the last digit of the number and ‚Äúpresses‚Äù the desired key. <br>  Before starting work, open a shared document, select a font with the same width of characters, set the cursor to the beginning of the text.  We connect the telephone-controlled keyboard to the computer and go! <br>  During the experiments, I managed to name a couple of lines, but looking at the same number is not at all interesting, I want a change in the text - go for it! <br>  USB HID keyboard is better implemented on the same controller that controls the cellular modem.  But by now I have a white spot with a black hole in this area, so the standard ‚ÄúPorto KP-01‚Äù numeric keypad was taken. <br>  Using a ‚Äúcrutch‚Äù in the form of a latch and an opto-assembly, the numeric keypad was connected to the controller board. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a7d/f06/5fb/a7df065fbd8245d59c24d130ef43eb3c.jpg"><br><br>  As a result, the work was done clumsily, in the future it is necessary to spend time on a detailed study of the USB protocol. <br>  For a real space star, this fragment of the scheme will not be needed; in the layout it is made in case of the absence or failure of the video broadcast channel. <br>  According to the result of the experiment, in the text document the last digit of the number is printed almost instantly after the call. <br><br>  <b>2. Putting video in public access.</b> <br>  There is no experience in the organization of video broadcasting.  After reading all sorts of different, I stopped at three options: Ustream, Bambuser and Ivideon.  The first option did not like the advertising line on the image, flashing at random times and flashing a lot of different information around.  The second is that when using the same camera, the image was not awful (most likely I just did not understand something).  As a result, Ivideon chose as a simple and clear option. <br>  It did not go smoothly here either: when viewing through the Internet from another computer, the flashes on the screen lagged behind reality, and the delay was significant.  The time machine turned out: the flash had already passed, and the image could be seen in many seconds.  Moreover, this problem manifested itself for all three considered services and actually served as the reason for searching for the working version. <br>  Another problem: sometimes the camera is not available from the first request.  After translating the system unit into a constantly vigorous state, the problem disappeared - no need to sleep during work. <br>  Began to read articles about video service.  As it turned out, the founder of this project is a Russian developer, habrovets and an interesting writer.  In addition, a young man that instills confidence in the country's intellectual future - all is not lost! <br>  As a result of reading articles and comments, I realized that in my case the delay in the image is due to a weak channel for returning to the Internet.  The speed was only 0.5 Mbit / s.  It turns out that the video from the camera is recorded on a computer, and it cannot be transmitted to the video service server at a viewing speed, that‚Äôs the whole secret of the ‚Äútime machine‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a9c/b67/535/a9cb6753578c4510aa5a349aa7e5a06d.jpg"><br><br>  Began to think. <br>  The first is, naturally, the struggle for speed.  I contacted the provider and identified the problem. <br>  While they were thinking about something, he decided to write a letter to the founder Ivideon through the habropochta.  He should be well versed in his field, especially since a habrovets habrovets will always help!  No, better this way: habrets habretsu will always help! <br>  And I had several proposals (except for increasing the channel width, of course): <br>  1. Make an absolutely black background, in which there will be only a flashing dot. <br>  2. To transfer not color, but black and white image. <br>  3. Change server settings: <br>  - quality (HI, MID, LOW); <br>  - video format (MPEG-4 or H.264); <br>  - bitrate (0.5 ... 4 Mbit / s); <br>  - frame rate (2 ... 30 frames / s); <br>  - Disable encryption when transferring data over the Internet. <br>  4. Reduce the size of the image from the camera to 640x480. <br>  5. What else? <br>  Vladimir answered correctly and in detail on all points of the proposals and said that a new version of Ivideon Server is expected, in which there will be a lot of new things. <br><br>  Meanwhile, the provider called.  The guys from the technical support service have fooled something on their side and the speed has increased to 0.75 Mb / s.  They also said that we have a good line and advised to enable AnnexM on our modem. <br>  After it was turned on, the speed increased slightly, to just 0.95 Mbit / s. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/40e/f27/f57/40ef27f57d5047bda9ceb37fb498afce.png"><br><br>  Since the result was unsatisfactory, the provider promised to change the modem, but not quickly.  This ‚Äúnot quickly‚Äù has grown into a further technical impossibility due to the lack of free lines. <br><br>  There is a theory that the universe is infinite and has no boundaries. <br>  In the second half of the 80s, a computer with a simple name ‚ÄúBK-0010‚Äù appeared, and it was completed with a large power supply unit, which had a black plastic case. <br>  It was here that the acquisition of the boundaries of the ‚ÄúUniverse‚Äù occurred.  The webcam for broadcasting video flashes on the Internet, and the ‚ÄúBig Dipper‚Äù constellation in the form of holes on the plate through which light from LEDs made its way perfectly fit into the case from the distant 80s.  The blackness of the vacuum filled all the remaining free space. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9de/96f/9dd/9de96f9dd2e94c80986f09ad04ccf6f3.jpg"><br><br>  Now power supplies make smaller and more difficult to place the Universe in them. <br>  In the layout there is only one constellation and a new star, but what did the one who created everything have to do? <br><br>  The experiment used a webcam ‚ÄúDefender GLory 1330HD‚Äù, such a ball on the stand.  To indicate that the camera is on, a blue LED is used, which highlights the object with a bluish tinge.  In addition, the camera is afraid of the dark, so at dusk, its built-in intelligence includes four white LEDs, which, along with blue, ‚Äúflood‚Äù the artificial night sky with its bright light.  Black night does not work. <br>  I had to trepan the skull of the camera and turn off the intracranial LED formations. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5f3/066/bc7/5f3066bc704d4c5887aff736ccaef984.jpg"><br><br>  Deep night has come.  In the sky became visible <a href="http://foto.mail.ru/mail/radikn/1465/1536.html">stars</a> , migrated to the layout.  And of course, one new one has been added! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/12f/940/e78/12f940e78b0247bd92473f3e4dd7c162.jpg"><br><br>  It remains only to fix the supernova, located just above the Dipper's dipper, and connect it to the galactic control scheme.  Now people can manage this supernova.  In the layout, the star froze in one place.  In reality, it is better to place the star on the ISS, as the most interesting object in the near space. <br>  As a result, the solution of the problem of flashing the LED will rise to unprecedented cosmic heights. <br><br>  During the experiments, a new candidate for live video broadcast appeared.  ‚ÄúGoogle+‚Äù provides an opportunity to organize a direct video call on the Youtube channel. <br>  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DucId6stchIw">I tried</a> , but the delays between real flashes and in the image via the Internet were also significant and reached up to 20 seconds. <br>  Changed the settings for the slow Internet (voice activation), the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D-fHOieI99iQ">delay is preserved</a> . <br><br>  I realized that it would not be possible to organize a live video, and I‚Äôll have to limit myself to a demonstration of the last digit of a phone number in a Google document, which is not quite full. <br>  And here comes the answer from Vladimir with a new modified version of Ivideon Server.  Still great when communication occurs in their native language.  Thank you so much Vladimir for your help and wish success with his project!  In my example, I felt what work and time are behind the changes in the thousandth position in the version build number and what real user support is. <br>  Watching a video is more interesting than seeing only a set of random numbers in the text. <br>  And with the ISP will have to think something.  Fortunately, now there are a large number of alternatives. <br><br>  <b>Ideas for the further implementation of the project ‚ÄúLight your star!‚Äù</b> <br>  Created a project site. <br>  The site displays and automatically calculates the funds received on the project account. <br>  Absolutely transparent system of income and expenditure of funds. <br>  Anyone can see how much was collected and what space projects were spent. <br>  The star is installed on the ISS, as one of the options.  To begin with, the experiment can be performed directly from the station, the Dome module allows it. <br>  The phone number is published in the media and the Internet. <br>  Despite all the tricks, when you call, the cellular channel ‚Äúengages‚Äù for a short time and makes the star inaccessible.  To solve this problem, it is possible to organize a flash through the project website or install a multi-channel phone to increase bandwidth.  But the maximum frequency should be limited by the visibility of individual flashes. <br>  The site publishes the current location of the star, the trajectory of the movement and the calculation of the location at any time of the day. <br>  The points at which the stars were flashed are plotted on the orbital trajectory of the spacecraft. <br>  It will be interesting to see which countries produced more outbreaks.  Since countries have different sizes, you can use an indicator, such as the number of flashes per kilometer of flight. <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Optional, but desirable part: on the site you can see the video from the ISS. In this case, the flash is seen against the background of the Earth. Thus, a person will be able to see the flash of a star not only above his head, but also above any point of the planet (within the ship's orbit), send hello to a friend, conduct flash mobs and other actions. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">When calling a star, the tube is ‚Äúlifted‚Äù and ‚Äúhang up‚Äù. The cost of a call is small, for example, $ 1. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Each bell produces a star flash, visible from Earth. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The call time and the last digit of the caller's number are recorded on the website and the author of the call can verify this. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">When sending any SMS, a triple flash is made, the last digit of the number and the flash time are also recorded on the website.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The cost of an SMS, for example 3 dollars, which is also available to many people. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If you send an e-mail address in the SMS text, then an automatic letter with a certificate will be sent to the box where you can express gratitude for your contribution to the development of Space and confirm that in honor of this contribution an outbreak was made at an altitude of XXX km above the Earth‚Äôs surface such a place, and had the following coordinates ... </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Man would be nice. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In this case, the cost can be made 5 dollars. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For people who have left their email inbox, it is possible to organize a voting system about the directions of new space projects for which money can be spent. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Those who pay the costs have the right to choose what they will do.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">You can make it possible not only to make a flash in the sky, but also to ‚Äúlight your name‚Äù in the SMS on the project website. In this case, the cost of the message will be already $ 7. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Another option: pre-order time or place flash via the Internet or SMS. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In any case: 1, 3, 5 or 7 dollars will be easy for people, and everyone will be able to contribute to the development of space research. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">One of the problems for providing live broadcast from the ISS is the lack of a complete radio coverage area. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We have all heard the phrase ‚Äúthe spacecraft is out of the range of the ground tracking systems‚Äù. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">To increase the coverage area, the network of ground stations is increased and the ships of the ‚ÄúMarine Space Fleet‚Äù are launched into the oceans.</font></font><br>    ‚Äú  ,       ‚Äù. <br>         .    10   .            ,        .     ,        .        ,   . <br><br>    ,      ,     ‚Äú  !‚Äù,     ,    ,      .     . <br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Roscosmos, NASA - AU!

There are a lot of inquisitive people, and it pleases. After 2,700 article views, 100 calls were made (one line of text is exactly one hundred numbers). Some probably called several times, I did not count my test calls. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">2. The video broadcast channel is holding on confidently. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The cellular modem seems to work too, at least there are no reviews that do not work. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Google disappoint, unfortunately. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">On the computer, where the layout is connected and the document is open in the author's mode, everything works great, the numbers appear immediately after the star flash (LED). The number of other readers does not exceed the number 49.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">On a computer that is in read mode (that is, everyone reading this document), the message appears: </font></font><br> <i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It looks like this file is very popular! Too many users are working on it, so some tools may not be available. Try again later. Skip.</font></font></i> <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> At the same time, if the numbers in the author's document have already appeared, then the readers do not. They will appear only after updating the page. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The caption </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"It looks like this file is very popular! Too many users are working on it ... ‚Äù</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> closes the file name with the phone number, so the star‚Äôs phone is duplicated in the second line of the document. </font></font><br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Supplement 3.</font></font></b> <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> November </font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">1,</font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 12, from 10:00 pm to 9:20 am on November 2 at 11:20 am there was no Internet connection with interruptions.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the age of continuous automation, the provider has no means of instantly detecting problems that have appeared. This is another identified bug. Everything had to be solved by personal attendance and phone calls. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If the device stood on the ISS, then everything would work fine. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">With this test, the cellular modem continued to fight off calls, and flash video and text with phone numbers were not available. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">On November 4, from 2:00 to 10:00, there was also no Internet connection. Calls were fought off, but the text and video at the specified moment were absent. </font></font><br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Supplement 4.</font></font></b> <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> On the night of November 7-8, an interesting failure occurred in Google documents.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The cursor has independently moved to the beginning of the text and the numbers began to ‚Äúfill up‚Äù before the words ‚ÄúFlash video‚Äù.

It was launched on October 31 at 17:14. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">During this time, the star received 946 calls and 111 SMS. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The greatest intensity of the messages was observed in the first two days. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The equipment worked without complaints. Internet connection was lost several times due to problems with the provider. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The video feed channel from Ivideon showed itself perfectly.</font></font><br>  Google      ,        .  :       Google          ,     .        . <br><br>       ! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/156865/">https://habr.com/ru/post/156865/</a></p>
