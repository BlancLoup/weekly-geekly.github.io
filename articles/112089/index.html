Yes, I knew what the Logitech policy was for broken devices.  But until now, I have never come across their customer service.  Perhaps my story is the same as that of many others, but in my case my non-working device was replaced even without my receipt confirming the purchase!  It turned out that this requires a bit of perseverance and maybe a little luck.  If you are interested in my story with a happy ending, welcome to the cat. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  A little background </h4><br>  My Logitech G9 bought back in January 2007 served me faithfully for all this time until the end of 2010.  In addition to all its advantages at that time - replaceable panels, a set of adjustable weights for 28 grams, dpi up to 3200, with polling up to 1000 times per second, as well as such trifles as switching profiles (stored, by the way, in the device‚Äôs memory, and not on specific PC) and the presence of the function of free ‚Äúnon-clicking‚Äù scrolling made it a wonderful rodent at that time.  Yes, it also had its drawbacks - the surface of the main panel that began to peel off in the very first two months of use and ... a USB cord

    <h4>  Beginning of the End </h4><br>  As strange as it may sound it is the USB cord cord, and as a result it caused the mouse to go out of order.  The fact is that the braid, although it looks good and fulfills its function of protecting the wire from mechanical damage, is a weak point in the G9 design.  The braid is quite tough and if periodically the cord is rewound and then unwound back into the braid there are places where it has not fully returned to its original shape and in this case the braid hardens in that position, and with it the wires inside.  I didn‚Äôt think about it without thinking about the first one and a half - two years dragging a rodent from home to work and back each time winding the wire around the mouse.  When after some time I noticed a lot of irregularities in the sheath, it was already too late to change anything, and I left the situation as it is.  The largest braided fracture appeared at the point where the cord exited the mouse - there it was almost 90 degrees down. <br><br>  Over time, the braid in this place began to "fluff" and from constant contact with the surface on which the mouse was used, the braid began to wipe <br><br>  In late 2010, the mouse began to periodically lose touch with the computer.  At first, the problem practically didn‚Äôt worry, but, apparently, with ever more severe deformation of the wire inside the sheath, the problem reached the permanent shutdown of the device in case of the slightest hitting of the mouse wire <br><br>  For clarity, I will show what the wire looked like at the point where it left the mouse: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/0d/52/0d523f7ac2d614da075d283e2fc9cf17.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  What to do? </h4><br>  Since it became almost impossible to work with your favorite mouse, it became necessary to do something urgently.  Remembering the wonderful stories about how Logitech deals with those of its customers who have their devices out of order, I decided, despite the respectable age of the mouse - it was not <br><br><h4>  Stage 1. Email </h4><br>  Go to the site Logitech and look at the top of the button "Support", and there is the item "How to contact us."  In order to be able to apply for support by email, you must register with Logitech.  Well, well, I registered and sent a message saying that this is how they say so and so - the mouse is old but beloved, the connection was lost when connected to any computers.  What can you expect?  The answer was not long in coming.  This is what Logitech support has requested for a possible review of a hardware replacement request: <br><ol><li>  Photos of the device entirely above and below, on a piece of paper with the incident number xxxxxx-xxxxxx written on it.  Each photo should not exceed 1 MB </li><li>  On the photos below should be visible numbers P / N, PID </li><li>  Mandatory photograph of the document confirming the purchase </li><li>  Video file confirming the inoperability of the device.  WMV file, no larger than 1MB </li><li>  Full address with postal code and telephone.  with a note that sending a replacement is possible only to Moscow and St. Petersburg </li></ol>  and another such condition - ‚ÄúIf you have not received a response from you within 7 days, it is considered that your problem has been resolved‚Äù <br><br>  If there are no special problems with the practical part (well, except perhaps try to shoot a video so that you can capture how the mouse loses touch, when it is not clear at what point it will happen, and then cut it off and convert it so that it is &lt;1Mb), then there was a bummer with the documents - 3 years ago I was not yet so responsible that I could put all the checks in one place and remember exactly where it is - this very place.  Therefore, after several days of searching for a check at home and interrupting all, even the most secluded corners, I found a package with drivers and instructions, but neither a box nor a check.  I was upset, because by that time all the other items had already been fulfilled.  Realizing that without this item, which went all the more marked ‚Äúmandatory,‚Äù I don‚Äôt really have much light, I didn‚Äôt write anything to the support and most likely the ticket on their side was successfully closed after the promised 7 days <br><br>  <b>There would be this story and end, but after a while she received an unexpected continuation</b> <br><br><h4>  Stage 2. Phone call </h4><br>  After some time, the mouse passed into a state of utter professional incompetence.  Now she was losing touch at the slightest grazing of the wire.  An attempt was made to search for at least some kind of service, which for a little money can bring the animal to life.  Only 1 (one!) Service was found, whose phones stubbornly refused to answer during the week at any time of the day.  As a last resort, I decided to call Logitech Moscow support phone. <br><br>  I phoned a young man named Anton ( <i>I decided to change the names of two Logitech support staffs on purpose just in case to avoid any consequences. I have a suspicion that even those names and surnames that are used when communicating with clients are a little untrue, or there are some other circumstances, but combinations of the names and names of the support staff made you think about it - for example, from my personal experience they communicated with me by email - Valera Solberg, and by phone - Anton Blaumenfik.</i>  <i>Namely, as you understand, they are not real, but they give an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãtheir consonance</i> ) I began to describe my problem by saying that he could not tell me something about the service of the Logitech center in Moscow.  Anton said that Logitech does not have an official service center in Russia (but it was already known) and that the only remaining option was to look for an unofficial master \ service who could help me.  Then the question followed - what actually happened? <br><br>  I briefly described the problem and the fact that I already communicated with the support by email.  Anton asked for the ticket number and almost immediately found it.  Having understood the situation and found out that the only thing I lacked was a sales receipt, Anton apparently decided to find out the others who were led by him why necessary information, which resulted in a dialogue that decided the fate of the replacement: <br><br>  (A) - G9 mouse and wire problem? <br>  (I) - yes <br>  (A) is the standard and most common problem for it. <br>  (I) - what to do? <br>  (A) - and what is your keyboard at home? <br>  (I) - Logitech G13 <br>  (BUT) - ! <br>  (I) - and a couple of Logitech Rumblepad 2 wireless joysticks and I like Logitech products in general <br>  (BUT) - !!! <br>  (A) - Well, in that case, I think that I can issue a replacement for you personally on my own, even without providing a sales receipt. <br>  (I) - !!! <br>  (A) - I will now duplicate the last letter from the support on my own behalf, in response, photographs of the mouse came out and necessarily a photo of the broken wire. <br>  (I'M OK! <br><br>  First thought - Logitech !!!  Further, a lot and obscene (joyfully).  Literally in half an hour, photographs are taken and sent back, to the incoming letter with my ticket raised from the depths of oblivion, to a support.  And some time later, I get the answer: <br><br>  ‚ÄúYour product has been successfully replaced, delivery will take from 7 to 10 business days and will be delivered to your door by UPS courier.  In the near future, you will receive a tracking number from the same company if you want to know where your product is located. ‚Äù  To its credit, UPS delivery took much less - if a 13.01 mouse just left the city of Utrecht in Holland, then already 18.01 in the morning I unpacked the received mouse in Moscow.  And this is taking into account the fact that 2 days - Saturday and Sunday, our valiant customs rests and does not handle the parcels passing through it (by the way, I was a little surprised - like war by war, and dinner on schedule?), That is, in fact, the mouse got to me for 3 days is a great result for both Logitech and UPS. <br><br>  Finally, I would also like to tell you about the element of surprise - since Anton did not mention what kind of mouse would be sent in return for my G9 until the last moment - that is, until I opened the UPS package, I did not know what exactly was coming to me.  Therefore, I was once again pleasantly surprised that Logitech did not make a bad bargain and sent the model a little better than the previous one.  And also, since they had to declare value when importing across the border, I also had an invoice for the amount of 50 euros.  I hope he does not come in handy.  But if something happens, I now also have a document confirming that the Logitech has transferred the mouse to me. <br><br>  Here it is, beautiful: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/b3/b5/b3b5d3ed82045b60a96a231e0cceb522.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  From technical changes - dpi increased to 5700 <br>  From the subjective - everything works clearly as it should be a new mouse. <br><br>  Thank you for taking the time to read to the end.  Perhaps for someone this topic will be useful.  If you have any questions, please, I'm in touch. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/112089/">https://habr.com/ru/post/112089/</a></p>
