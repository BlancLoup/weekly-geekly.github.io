Sometimes it is difficult, sometimes you just want to work with dictionaries, there are already many ready-made solutions like RestKit, which generally is a universal combine for all occasions, so why write another bike? <br><br>  <b>Modified charging can hack any iOS device in a minute</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/apps4all/blog/182012/">Rus</a> <br>  Security researchers have discovered a new way of illegally introducing programs into an iOS device using a modified charger.  A team at the Georgia Institute of Technology says that charging them can download arbitrary software to any iOS device for one minute from the moment they are connected. <br><br>  <b>Configure Travis-CI for iOS open source projects</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/182294/">Rus</a> <br>  Continuous integration (continuous integration) - the practice of development, allowing to achieve greater confidence in the stability and correctness of any project.

It was this unfortunate fact that led me to the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãstarting to assemble my CarPC on the basis of android. <br><br>  <b>Modification of stock firmware for Android</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/181826/">Part 1</a> and <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/182640/">Part 2</a> <br>  What was my disappointment when I purchased a phone from China, where the use of Google, Skype, Facebook and other applications was prohibited by factory settings.  In principle, it was possible to close my eyes to some things, but when my phone did not imply the use of a Google account, I made a promise to make sure I didn‚Äôt have to.  Half a year has passed and my custom firmware has been successfully used around the world.  This series of articles will cover how to do reverse programming for Android, implement patches, tweaks, and mods. <br><br>  <b>Mercury - herald of android bugs</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/tzor/blog/181450/">Rus</a> <br>  Today we will look at how and how you can find vulnerabilities in your and other people's android applications.  Also see what an attacker can do with these vulnerabilities. <br><br>  <b>Top 5 Tips to Increase Android Phone Running Time</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/mugenpower/blog/181538/">Rus</a> <br>  The running time of the phone on Android is a constant headache.  That is why this issue is discussed endlessly on sites such as Mobile Nations or XDA Developers - ROM developers and modders are trying to find the optimal combination of hardware and software that would last as long as possible. <br><br><h4>  Development </h4><br><br>  <b>Google launched cloud platform Mobile Backend Starter</b> <br>  <a href="http://apps4all.ru/news/google/google-mobile-backend-starter.html">Rus</a> + <a href="http://apps4all.ru/news/applications/kinvey-obyedinyaetsya-s-google-app-engine.html">Kinvey teamed up with MBS</a> <br>  Google launched the Mobile Backend Starter cloud platform, which, in one click, allows you to deploy a cloud backend for a mobile application. <br><br>  <b>Xamarin + PCL + MVVM - how to facilitate writing mobile applications for different platforms</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/182354/">Rus</a> <br>  Somehow, the Xamarin 2.0 platform was completely undeservedly deprived of attention, and I would like to start describing all of its remarkable properties. <br><br>  <b>PhoneJS - New HTML5 framework for mobile applications</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/devexpress/blog/182134/">Rus</a> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/dc0/dea/7bf/dc0dea7bffe2722f4acd98e2a2702d8e.png" alt="image"><br>  We in DevExpress organized a small team that for several months analyzed and tried various existing tools and approaches.  The result of this experience - PhoneJS - is our complete solution for creating cross-platform mobile applications in HTML5. <br><br>  <b>Announcement of Visual Studio 2013</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/microsoft/blog/182116/">Rus</a> <br>  At TechEd, Brian Harry announced the release of Visual Studio 2013 and Team Foundation Server 2013, as well as many of the new features of these products related to application lifecycle management. <br><br>  <b>Moves presents its API</b> <br>  <a href="http://apps4all.ru/news/applications/moves-api.html">Rus</a> <br>  Developers can retrieve information received by the application, including data on the distances traveled, places visited and routes traveled.  This data can be used as a supplement to information obtained from other applications (you can easily imagine cooperation between Moves and someone like Withings, for example), or to create games that increase user activity. <br><br>  <b>All analytics in Segment.io for Android and iOS</b> <br>  <a href="http://apps4all.ru/news/applications/segment-io.html">Rus</a> <br>  Segment.io is a start-up supported by Y Combinator, which facilitates the integration of many analytics providers' APIs into their applications, today it is expanding its service to the mobile sphere.  The company introduced a mobile SDK for iOS and Android, which will allow developers to connect about 25 different analytic services at once without having to embed each code or place the application in the store again when switching to another analytics provider. <br><br><h4>  Monetization </h4><br><br>  <b>Can I cash in on users?</b>  <b>3 easy ways to increase application monetization</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/182488/">Rus</a> <br>  For many applications, this is, in general, the only reasonable way to make at least something.  For example, we still didn‚Äôt have enough imagination to figure out how to fasten an advertising or F2P model to our children's book, and the paid version is more expensive than one dollar, users refuse to download, no matter what description and screenshots you come up with. <br><br><h4>  Promotion </h4><br><br>  <b>As I have not slept a year or the creation of a social Android application</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/182138/">Rus</a> <br>  It all started about a year ago.  Then, I decided to start my first project.  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe application came to me almost immediately.  Its original version sounded like this - ‚ÄúI want everyone to know the independent opinion of people all over the world, on the subject of interest.‚Äù <br><br>  <b>About popular games in the Apple AppStore and Google Play</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/mailru/blog/181974/">Rus</a> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/853/373/fce/853373fce06d63d9f2057df4d85cef77.png" alt="image"><br>  The Mail.Ru Group mobile team is actively exploring the local markets of Google Play and the AppStore, studying the interests of the audience to certain game genres, trying to understand what needs more attention to be paid when developing.  The company has accumulated a decent amount of data, and she laid out part of them to help the novice developer in understanding the market situation. <br><br>  <b>Experience using BuySellAds to promote iOS games</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/182568/">Rus</a> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a00/14b/ba3/a0014bba36d002a11bdd8687d9dcf56f.png" alt="image"><br>  The site quite often flashes in various posts and comments including here, on Habr√©.  If someone does not know, then this service allows you to buy ads directly from a specific site at a certain price for a while, for example, a month, or for the number of impressions of an advertising banner. <br><br>  <b>‚ÄúTongue twisters‚Äù.</b>  <b>Part 2: Promotion in the Russian App Store</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/osc/blog/174523/">Part 1</a> and <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/osc/blog/181648/">Part 2</a> <br>  Today we will talk about the progress in the Russian App Store on the example of the application ‚Äútongues on a carton‚Äù. <br><br>  <b>Trademob: you need 80,000 downloads and $ 56,000 to get into the American gaming top</b> <br>  <a href="http://www.trademob.com/infographic-calculating-the-cost-of-a-top-10-rank-in-the-app-store/">English infographics</a> <br>  Trademob calculated how much it would cost for the game to hit the Top 10 in the American, German and English App Store. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/182666/">https://habr.com/ru/post/182666/</a></p>
