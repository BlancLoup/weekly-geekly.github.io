Well, what could be so cool about carrying ‚Äúmugs‚Äù?  For the sake of doubtfully comfortable sound, organize in a bag a cubic decimeter of space and 350 grams of weight?  No thanks, this is not for me.

    <h4>  First impression </h4><br>  When the parcel arrived from Dadget, I immediately opened the box, took out the WIRELESS (!) Headphones and connected them to the tablet.  Work has become much easier and much more fun - there is no need to get confused in the wires, you should not pause a song when you go, say, to the printer or at tea. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0d9/310/917/0d93109171844a94ac3d2a0f7a2268d5.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Equipment.</i>  <i>Fotochka from a third-party site</i> <br><br>  Next - my impressions of two weeks with wireless technology and, of course, fotochki <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  Another undoubted advantage of Bluetooth-headphones can be called control directly on the cups.  All the in-ear headphones that I used before had a maximum ‚ÄúAnswer call‚Äù button, here there are three buttons and they have all the necessary minimum: start / stop, forward / back / louder / quieter and answer the call or reset it.  In my opinion, this is enough. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c80/b42/df0/c80b42df043c45f0be9a736a906785a9.jpg" alt="image"><br><h6>  <i>Control buttons.</i>  <i>It's pretty simple, just get used to it.</i> </h6><br><br><h4>  Sound </h4><br>  I am not a great expert in sound quality, but the fact that the music in the headphones blocks the noise from outside (especially on an airplane) is a plus for me.  The sound is smooth, I did not notice any distortions in the low or high frequencies, while watching the movie it seems that the characters speak right in your head.  That is, what you need.  By the way, the sound from the outside can be heard when the volume is set to low, but it turns out to be muffled, as if from a well.  It‚Äôs good if you walk down the street and listen to music, and someone calls you (at first, dumbly, of course, as from a horror movie, your grave voice calls you, but then you get used to it).  Again, at the transitions do not need to remove the headphones. <br><br>  When viewing the battle scenes in The Avengers, the eardrums did not burst, but the voice of Evgenia Simonova from Ordinary Miracle was heard well.  This suggests that there is some kind of stray that regulates the sound, there is still inside.  But I will not argue - did not understand.  Until ;) <br><br><h4>  Autonomy and ergonomics </h4><br>  The stated 11 hours of sounding is quite a real figure.  From the moment I received it, I only charged the headphones twice - once the initial charge was out of the box and a second time before it was released, just in case.  Flying on business trips to the hero city of Minsk, I watched at least two films per trip - this is already 4 hours of active work.  However, after the bus from the airport I turned off the headphones and turned them on only on the way back, so the waiting time could not be measured. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/292/42a/669/29242a669a3c48f5ad58149ec67ee1b3.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>This I ride the bus and watch a movie</i> <br><br>  I rarely used the device as a headset - the sound of the iPhone freezes up a bit (I heard my wife from the next room a second earlier than in my ears), but there were no problems with Skype - the image on the iPad screen and the sound completely matched.  Checked during more than one communication session of Peter-Chalkidiki, even on the poor Internet.  But I didn‚Äôt notice the stated 10 meters radius of action - after 4-5 meters the interference starts, although there was only a door from the partitions (but with an iron grille-shutter. Perhaps this is the problem). <br><br>  With the ergonomics of the headphones, almost everything is in order - the ears are inserted into the ambushors like a glove, but the headband (arc) is slightly too small and this causes some discomfort.  It does not save even razdvizhka fasteners to the maximum.  They came to the child at the very time, the cartoons went with a bang, and I periodically for a second pull out one ear, when I watch films, so that the top of the head rests.  So people with head-oval need to try them on before buying.  As, actually, all the headphones. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3bd/470/229/3bd4702294164869a4d24968f5b50b24.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>A child listens to music at the hotel while waiting for a "taxi to Dubrovka"</i> <br><br>  There is a special bag for carrying in the package (the headphones fold and this makes them a bit more compact), but I haven‚Äôt used it yet, it is pleasant to wear the device around your neck.  So no need to look for a place in your bag / briefcase / backpack. <div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Unexpected psychological fact</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  It is noticed that a person with headphones attracts more attention from the opposite sex at the airport, especially if he is holding the hand of a child and there is no second half around.  Psychology :) <br></div></div><br><br>  A small but pleasant mulka - on the iPhone and iPad screen, next to the Bluetooth icon, you can see the battery charge level. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0e2/27c/eac/0e227ceac95b480496922ea07608083c.png" alt="image"><br>  <i>The charge level of the internal battery is displayed next to the connection icon.</i> <br><br><h4>  Connect and control </h4><br>  The connection is standard: for the first time you press the Power button for a few seconds - the phone or tablet searches for the device and remembers it.  Next - just a button for two seconds.  Convenient, but this is probably the standard. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d42/f22/22d/d42f2222d8d64ae398071d544cfcb717.png" alt="image"><br>  <i>For the first time you need to get into the "Settings".</i>  <i>Further it will not be required</i> <br><br>  Three buttons, as I said above, are terribly convenient.  Upper control the main functions, the lower two - the sound and scrolling forward / back.  True, the increase in sound with a long press (about a second), with a short press unwinds one song back.  A bit unusual, but this is a matter of habit.  All the buttons are on the right ear, so when driving from the side it seems that you scratch the turnip.  Seriously, I myself wondered before myself: did this guy haven't washed his head for a long time? <br>  All of the above applies only to a wireless connection, but what about those who don‚Äôt have this module in the laptop (‚Äúwho doesn‚Äôt have Bluetooth in the laptop is the one!‚Äù)?  For these cases, the perfect half meter cable that connects to the audio jack. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/30e/8a5/ac9/30e8a5ac970b4d59b06f0ef668ad4361.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Wired connection is generally elementary.</i> <br><br>  In general, everything is intuitively understandable, but the instruction in Russian replaces a couple of hours of poking. <br><br><h4>  findings </h4><br>  Personally, I liked the headphones.  Small cons more than offset by the pluses.  I'm not a great expert in sound quality and wireless technologies, but this headset covers all my needs.  Finally <br><br><h5>  3 reasons to buy a wireless Dudget headphones: </h5><br>  1. Wireless connection to any device where there is Bluetooth <br>  2. The possibility of using as a headset <br>  3. Autonomy - 10-12 hours in active mode <br><br><h5>  3 reasons not to buy wireless headphones Dadzhet: </h5><br>  1. For owners of large heads, the mount is not very convenient, the adjustment ‚Äúon the head‚Äù is minimal. <br>  2. The stated range of 10 meters - only in open areas <br>  3. The device is not all-weather, it is written in the instructions that it should not be worn in the rain (the question is probably solved by a hood).  In winter, the battery capacity should drop by about 30-40% <br><br>  As always, <a href="http://dadget.ru/katalog/dom-i-dacha/bluetooth-naushniki/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Darticle%26utm_term%3Dbluetooth-naushniki%26utm_content%3Dbluetooth-naushniki%26utm_campaign%3Dbluetooth-naushniki_102">Dadzhet</a> provides readers with Geektimes a promotional code for purchasing ‚ÄúWireless Headphones with Microphones‚Äù at a discount: GEEKT-BNM.  The discount is valid for 20 days from the date of publication. <br><br>  PS: The package includes a micro-USB cable for charging.  The power plug is not attached, but those who take them with them on vacation or a business trip, I think, will not be very upset because  cable can be connected to the charging from the smartphone </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/368189/">https://habr.com/ru/post/368189/</a></p>
