And the habit of making computer hardware work "for all the money" can be used in sports - adults, with championships, sponsors, fans and prizes.  Today we will talk about the little things you need to know about such championships, find out what you need in order to declare yourself on the overclocking scene and recall the success stories of overclocking masters. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b93/198/e0c/b93198e0c15e466e903f4d53c6ac6012.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h1>  You have the spirit of an overclocker, if ... </h1><br>  Overclocking is a sport to which you need to be psychologically prepared.  First of all - to stop evaluating sports acceleration as a relaxed pastime with periodic topping up of liquid nitrogen.  With such an inert approach, even an elementary barbecue can not be successfully cooked, not to mention serious results with PC components.

      It‚Äôs impossible to say with absolute certainty ‚Äúwhat they don‚Äôt take to overclock‚Äù - today it‚Äôs possible to squeeze out all the juices of enthusiasts of various professions, age and qualifications from iron, so be a ‚Äú20-year-old specialist with 15 years of experience‚Äù or two higher educations like in pretentious corporations, not necessary.  Requires perseverance and ingenuity like the one that is usually guided by the reception of alcohol - they say, and whether you need to take a little more, or is it enough with me? <br><br>  Newbies usually train their patience and work on the home gland - they study materiel on the forums, go from ‚Äúdo well‚Äù in modern motherboards to manual BIOS settings, experiment with cooling systems and voltages, assemble a set of ‚Äúoverclocking long-term construction‚Äù for a while they are disappointed in the idea and help their friends as a ‚Äúshaman‚Äù who can speed up computers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2c2/529/278/2c25292783824a64801b71c062905c86.jpg"><br>  <i>To train in the dispersal of components the first time will have on your home computer</i> <br><br>  Yes, all these streamlined phrases speak almost nothing about anything, but the meaning is the following: if you are satisfied with a processor with a locked multiplier, and the desire to ‚Äúcheer up‚Äù a computer configuration does not appear, you are hardly ready for extreme competitions, in which for the sake of ridiculous increase the frequency will have to spend nerve cells and impressive means.  In general, do not confuse fitness with weightlifting. <br><br><h1>  Financial issue </h1><br>  Just as racing cars differ from serial (often they are not even real lights!), Overclocking stands are a little like standard home-office system units.  But, as in the amateur races, overclockers start with high-volume components and air-conditioning modifications of the home PC. <br>  Selected samples of iron and their abundance come along with the first successes and wins, and before that - some investment of money and the ‚Äúsweet-eastern‚Äù routine for the sake of fame and future sponsors. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/005/772/2b1/0057722b18c24c05abb3cf09664419ab.JPG"><br>  Amateur gaming PC configuration in the <a href="http://hwbot.org/newsflash/2641_rookie_ifeelyou_shows_off_lucky_draw_prize_(and_its_an_awesome_picture)/">Rookie Rumble</a> nomination <br><br>  We will not be cunning and note that among the fans of overclocking there are often ‚Äúfeather sharks‚Äù - former journalists or ‚Äúreviewers‚Äù, as they today squeeze in the forums with disgust.  These extroverts go into overclocking, not because the BIOS is such a nice and responsive companion, but because of the overclocking experience that iron reviewers get while working in the media. <br><br>  In terms of financing and sampling, overclocking tournaments are divided into two types: it happens that the same (according to the manufacturer) components are distributed between the participants randomly and overclockers can only hope that their copy will be mastered by the truly harsh overclocking. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/424/003/830/4240038309ed4b06bcc239da4fbb87a1.JPG"><br>  <i><a href="http://www.overclock3d.net/reviews/memory/kingston_hyper_x_2000mhz_review/3">The kit of</a> ultra fast (as for 2010) DDR3 memory looks like this</i> <br><br>  In other cases, participants of the tournament fight using their own samples of processors, video cards, memory and drives, and then the fight either goes into the category of "manufacturers credits" or the wealthy guys who sifted through dozens of chips in advance and chose the best gain an advantage over the less well-off participants. <br>  What to do is always better to be rich and healthy than poor and sick, and it would also be incorrect to ‚Äúbeat the hand‚Äù of successful participants, because the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãoverclocking is precisely the highest quality of iron and its work at the limit of capabilities. <br><br><h1>  Where to go to the enthusiast? </h1><br>  The overclocking movement did not really have time to acquire a bureaucracy - there is neither multistage international regulators, nor meldonium, nor such a <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/274562/">variety of cheats</a> as in a big sport.  But there is a centralized "Mecca" in which records are <a href="http://hwbot.org/">kept</a> - <a href="http://hwbot.org/">HWBot.org</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ce5/ed4/a57/ce5ed4a57b884665bc817b09b578bb66.png"><br>  <i>Processor disciplines on the website HWBot.org</i> <br><br>  This site was originally a project of the Belgian, Frederik Colardyn (Frederik Colardyn).  Then, in a short time, it was transformed into the largest resource with ratings in overclocking disciplines, results of individual iron models, and a forum of computer enthusiasts.  What is most important - anyone can take part in the ‚Äúexhibition of overclocking achievements‚Äù.  It is enough to register and then see in the table your result in one of six ‚Äúweight categories‚Äù.  In separate rotations, newcomers are huddled with a backlog of ‚Äúcan I poke around here a little?‚Äù To enthusiastic legends with self-assembly cooling systems and pre-production heavy-duty iron at the ready. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2aa/871/8a5/2aa8718a546e45a28b93600bb0c31def.png"><br>  <i>Any test result must be validated.</i> <br><br>  Taking part in the community is even easier than proving any social network that you are you.  It is enough to enter a standard set of e-mail and password, choose a country and a team (since you are not a lone wolf, but plan to storm records collectively and in various disciplines), after which you will only have to timidly load test results in the hope of success. <br><br>  In the boot menu, you will need to designate the configuration of the computer and the cooling system + send a screenshot for verification with an open benchmark, CPU-Z (depending on the discipline), and / or other data for greater certainty.  It‚Äôs better to see once, so admire the wPrime test result download process. <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dWlG4zvqDc4" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h1>  What's next? </h1><br>  Your results in HWBot is a <s>multi-</s> pass business card on the way to participating in overclockers competitions.  It starts with open local tournaments (take a look at the typical <a href="http://megaobzor.com/sorevnovaniya-po-overklokingu-v-ramkah-TECHLABS-CUP-BY-2013-startovali.html">requirements for participants in the</a> qualifying round of such events), and all subsequent achievements depend only on your skill and, to some extent, luck.  It will be necessary to discover the achivka "overclocking at temperatures below zero" and flash in the comparative table so that organizers of serious tournaments and / or iron producers interested in court overies will pay attention to the talented overclocker. <br><br>  Up to the psychological mark ‚Äúoverclocking at negative temperatures,‚Äù not so much perpetual iron remains.  But there are still ways to make a noise in HWBot - look, for example, how to take the line at 3100 MHz using the HyperX Savage DDR4 [HX426C15SBK4 / 64] high-volume memory kit without any cooling tricks, and even reduce the delays caused by overclocking. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/701/3eb/3ac/7013eb3ac90446c5994c5b51cd19b9ba.jpg"><br>  <i>HyperX's overclocking memory allows you to save nerve cells for crazy records, rather than squeezing the results out of iron with great effort.</i> <br><br>  It is enough just to arrange the timings and select the voltage optimal for specific memory modules (within 1.6-1.65 V).  Not Jedi?  Yes, but why complicate your life if the set at a reasonable price allows you to set records without too much extreme in a test bench?  Never reach for a railgun if the opponent can be kicked efficiently. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f19/776/7e3/f197767e37ce469587cc55d15f492a1f.png"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3ed/3c8/940/3ed3c894052e437aa0e7591abf4b4ecc.png"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b2e/3bb/a36/b2e3bba368044e2894ca6ef24142fd0f.png"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ed7/087/13e/ed708713ec6d4136a9644eff0f5046dd.png"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3fd/c93/a9c/3fdc93a9c85d414aa46fbee9c5729f35.png"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/783/5bc/448/7835bc44826c43adbcd22f0958ebaffe.png"><br>  <i>Overclocking HyperX Savage DDR4 - detailed instructions on the site <a href="http://oclab.ru/articles/rukovodstvo-po-razgonu-operativnoj-pamyati-hyperx-savage-hx426c15sbk4-64-64-gb-na-materinskoj-plate-asus-rog-rampage-v-edition-10">OClab.ru</a></i> <i><br></i> <br>  The deeper into the forest - the angrier wolves.  From a negative Celsius mark, overclocking is already losing the household charm (that is, gaming and working needs fade into the background, the main thing is power for the record), but the cooling becomes very colorful even in an inexpensive version with dry ice.  And then it is time to switch to heavy artillery - liquid helium, for example, with which it becomes real to drop the temperature down to -273 ¬∞ C.  It will be necessary to sweat a lot so that the processor / video card works in this mode correctly, because it will be necessary to control the voltage with an eye to other parameters than with water or air cooling. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a7a/8b2/eb3/a7a8b2eb366e447cb5dc706b357b39ea.jpeg"><br>  <i>"... I knew that sooner or later we will move on to this beauty"</i> <br><br><h1>  Man and ship </h1><br>  After the hardware manufacturers stopped fighting with overclocking and decided to sponsor it in return, the most talented members of the community, one after another, tried on the position of engineers in the state of overclocking iron manufacturers.  It must be said that ‚Äúfree‚Äù fans of overclocking are looking askance at such a career, because the procedure is similar to that, as if the video blogger-truth-bearer would start a talk show on TV.  It seems that the new level of submission, but the corporate framework will now be felt. <br><br>  Overkloker <b>K | ngp | n</b> (USA) - perhaps the main man-brand among all overclocking fans.  Famous since 2002, one of the first to use liquid nitrogen in overclocking video cards.  He succeeded in overclocking NVIDIA video cards, and then developed a special <a href="http://www.ixbt.com/news/2015/07/22/evga-geforce-gtx-980-ti-kingpin-acx-2-0-asic-quality.html">‚Äútuned‚Äù series</a> for EVGA video cards with his own hand-designed cooling and power supply system. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/41e/326/d21/41e326d215f2491281c1a14b7681d4d6.jpg"><br>  <i>K | ngp | n</i> <br><br>  <b>HiCookie</b> - another world record holder in overclocking comes from Taiwan, now the head of the overclocking unit GIGABYTE.

Noted with the creation of ultra-efficient motherboards and video cards.  As of autumn 2016, took a creative break. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b88/d46/807/b88d46807b1a4f69833e81af7856b9d4.jpg"><br>  <i>Shamino</i> <br><br>  <b>AndreYang</b> is famous for overclocking the AMD Bulldozer processor to an astronomical 8709 MHz and conquering the bar at 7089.3 MHz on an Intel Core i7-3770K processor in 2012.
