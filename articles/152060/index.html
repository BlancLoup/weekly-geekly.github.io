  <section class="page js-page"><h1>MOD Live - experience to use</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello!  Winter is just around the corner and, on the eve of the new ski season, I want to tell you about personal experiences in using (last winter) the gadget described in Habr√© almost a year ago. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/542/466/625/54246662528b9cdffea73b843f558a06.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a>  Author's note: <i>This is my first post, I tried to do it in the style of others seen on Habr√©.</i>  <i>Dear readers, I would be very grateful for comments and comments on the format + edit tips.</i>  <i>I promise to fix it :)</i> <br><br>  So, this is <b>MOD <u>Live</u></b> (different from the usual MOD by convenient communication with most smartphones, bluetooth cameras, etc.). <br>  For those who are lazy to search for a past topic, this is, roughly speaking, an interactive display designed for ski masks.  He marks the speed of the movement, how long the last jump lasted, etc.  (details further). 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

        </script>
      <br>
    <habracut>  In the corner of the display, all useful, customizable information is displayed - the clock, location, temperature, total distance, length / height / time of the jump, saves the statistics and then shares the records (both with the owner and, if he wishes, with everyone who wishes, by sending on FB).  But, the main thing is not this, the main thing is a convenient opportunity to record video, without using other devices (well, except for the camera itself, which comes with it - Contour + and Contour GPS hands-free HD (It is bought separately). And by connecting Mod Live to a smartphone using Bluetooth 2.0, the glasses become, in some ways, an external display of the device.You can use the navigation, receive and reject calls (a earphone is inserted into the ear, a microphone is built-in), reply to SMS messages (albeit without dialing text, and sending template, pre-clogged messages - ho  I don't have time for calls, no calls, of course, no, but when you stand and don't want to climb behind the phone, that is another matter) - but all this, of course, only if it is connected to the phone. <br>  Well, I generally keep quiet about music - I think everyone understands that it plays tracks from the phone without any problems. <br><br><h4>  Technical stuffing </h4><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/773/961/10c/77396110cbe2e6c5071ef8414c391212.jpg"><br><br>  MOD Live is powered by an ARM Cortex ‚ÄìA8 processor (600 MHz clock frequency).  The device has its own built-in memory of 512 MB (. RAM - 256 MB RAM (this is enough). The temperature seems to be stable, but I did not use it at -35, I repent - I was afraid (my ‚Äúmaximum‚Äù is -25). Protection on decent level - the display is inserted and fixed into the frame, the viewfinder is near the glass itself, so even if the mask falls and the mask is not broken, nothing should happen to anyone or the device. I don‚Äôt even mention moisture resistance and protection from vibration, the whole unit would be useless. <br><br>  Although the capacity of the battery is 1200 mAh, it rarely works longer than 5 hours, and if you turn on ‚ÄúInternet + GPS + video recording, etc.‚Äù, they die in three hours.  Although, I confess, only once, for the sake of the test, I checked it - GPS is usually working and I take video on the power of 2-5 minutes (if you don‚Äôt travel abroad, the average length of the mountain is 1 km, you drive 50-60 seconds, you don‚Äôt have to take a lot of )), and in this version of ‚Äú4 hours of work‚Äù - ‚Äúhour of recharging‚Äù (when I also eat glasses) is comfortable enough. <br>  The WQVGA display with a resolution of 428x240 (you will say ‚Äúnot much‚Äù), but with unaccustomed use it distracts so much (you have to not only measure records, but don‚Äôt beat people) - that's just the right time. <br>  With all this, the gadget remains almost weightless (weight 65 grams, most of which, takes a battery). <br><br>  PS Manufacturers periodically update the firmware, as the unit will carefully report as soon as it connects to the Internet, and next year it is planned to upgrade to Wi-Fi (in this country is not very relevant, but abroad - yes) and several smaller improvements. <br><br><h4>  MOD Live usability </h4><br>  Now the question I asked myself all the way until I put the glasses on myself: would this ‚Äúvirtual screen with an eleven-inch diagonal‚Äù interfere with the review?  At first, it will be very, because the look constantly jumps on the shifting tsiferki to please the brain with a new achievement, but quickly get comfortable: by the second day, you no longer have to force yourself to look up, and after a couple of weekends you will only watch at special moments yes switch tracks :) <br><br>  <u><b>UPD:</b></u> All control is done using the buttons on the remote, which is displayed on the side of the glasses: <br>  Everything is controlled with these buttons - change of displays, answers to calls, switching songs, sending data to the Internet and navigator.  It is not always ‚Äúintuitively understandable,‚Äù but after 2-3 days of practice, almost all functions are well needed. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/fe0/c8b/416/fe0c8b416ce6fede91c447804ca0df8c.jpg"><br><br>  GPS accuracy is very high - determines the location of a person with an accuracy of 2-5 meters.  Thus, you can not worry about the device cheating with location or records (in general, if I didn‚Äôt look like an astronaut, I‚Äôd drive with glasses, the navigator is clearly more capable than my DigiWalker). <br>  Another great advantage of using MOD Live is that you can find the way to any place of interest, determine the desired route by name, or find something new and interesting.  MOD Live can be very useful if you, for example, get lost and you or your fellow enthusiast are lost.  All can be tracked and safely reunite. <br>  For MOD Live, new applications are constantly being developed using new features of the gadget.  For example, you can connect to MOD Live not only a smartphone, but also an HD camera, or a heart rate monitor.  Again, this is all done very simply, using Bluetooth technology. <br><br><h4>  More about the interface </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/05c/e55/75f/05ce5575feb19f4781071f038974844f.jpg"><br><br>  If desired, the MOD Live user will be able to independently adjust the angle at which he will see the display, but I didn‚Äôt bother with this - quite noticeably and ‚Äúby default‚Äù.  A particularly difficult task was the detailed study of 590 resorts in fourteen countries of the world (this country included).  But now you can go skiing, wherever you want to be with your darling - you won‚Äôt get lost if this is, of course, not a jungle of Siberia. <br>  The developers themselves recommend using MOD Live complete with Briko ski goggles.  They are very light, have a completely normal design (as far as the SKID goggles can afford), they are comfortable and they do not sweat.  We can say that the combination of Briko and MOD Live can be considered a reference in this area, although no one bothers to put the gadget on others. <br>  Actually, the operating system in MOD Live provides only three menu items: Buddy Tracking (you can find friends and let them find yourself), Viewer (displays information about the last trips), and, finally, music. <br><br>  With the help of the HQ-application recently adapted by developers for MOD Live, it became possible to share information about their achievements with friends using Facebook and Twitter (there would also be support for V Kontakte - it would be nice for our man). <br><br><h4>  MOD Live cost </h4><br>  It is clear that the developers, among other things, presented to the wide audience ready-made kits, which, in addition to MOD Live itself, include one of the four ‚Äúpatented‚Äù versions of ski glasses: Alpina, Briko, Uvex, Zeal.  Of course, no ‚Äúaffordable prices‚Äù are out of the question here, for example, in the USA, Uvex G.GL9 glasses with MOD Live will cost $ 539, and Zeal Z3 optics, equipped with a new gadget, cost $ 549. <br>  Our own person can get a MOD Live gadget not so much in many online stores, mainly from abroad to carry, BUT - Yandex to help, by using the MODE prodevices tag you can also find us (in Russia it can be more expensive, but without problems). <br><br>  In principle, skiing has always been one of the most expensive sports, and the emergence of MOD Live and similar innovations does not make it cheaper.  However, a huge number of various functions and settings of the gadget in fact opens up the widest possibilities for the owner not only for ‚Äúnoso‚Äù metrics with his friends and for recording video and his own records.  At foreign resorts, this is a doubly useful thing.  And the children are delighted with her :) </habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/152060/">https://habr.com/ru/post/152060/</a></p>
