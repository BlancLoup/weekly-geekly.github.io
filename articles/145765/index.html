  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Comparison of programs to remove banners ransomware (blockers)</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Programs for removing computer blockers, extortionists, as a rule, are intended for an inexperienced user who does not need to use tools such as <b>regedit.exe</b> or <b>uVS</b> in everyday life, and when ‚Äúunexpectedly‚Äù comes a blocker, the user wants to find a panacea that quickly and easily heal his computer.  Of course, the panacea cannot be found, but it turns out to find some program that will try to cure the computer.  And if this program helps an inexperienced user, then he extols this program as a means of all program extortionists, and if it does not help, he expresses his ‚Äúfoo‚Äù at the mention of its name by other users.  I propose to conduct a small comparison of these programs. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Define common points: <br><ul><li>  All of these tools work only with the LiveCD.  This is logical, because  the blocker actively opposes its removal; </li><li>  All these utilities are trying to use a universal way to remove the extortionist, which is suitable for existing malware and those that appear in the future;  and the method of detecting already known malicious "in person" - it is less effective, but it is not possible to create a universal remedy against some ransomware, therefore developers of this software have to "spin" in order to make life easier for an inexperienced user. </li></ul><br>  Go directly to this free software. <br><br><h4>  Kaspersky WindowsUnlocker </h4><br>  The utility is developed in the dungeons of the most famous Russian antivirus.  This utility is recorded in a special version of the LiveCD Kaspersky Rescue Disk.  By the way, I observed a lack of understanding of users regarding this policy - why create a special version of the LiveCD, is it not easier to put all the "fishes" on one disc?  One user advises another to download Kaspersky WindowsUnlocker, and he downloads the usual Kaspersky Rescue Disk - as a result, he does not see the necessary utility ... <br>  <b>Proceed to the pluses:</b> <br>  restores the Winlogon folder in the registry to the initial state; <br>  something else restores in the registry, perhaps, eliminates extortioners' pranks (blocking Registry Editor and other trifles), but the official manual on the Kaspersky website does not report this, we can only guess; <br>  the presence of Kaspersky Rescue Disk allows you to check your computer for known malware, which may allow you to detect extortionists "in person", including those that infect the boot sector; <br>  the presence of a utility to easily create a LiveCD on a flash drive. <br>  <b>Let's go to the minuses:</b> <br>  to launch the utility, you must call the Terminal and work with the command line - for an inexperienced user this can cause difficulties when using; <br>  processing of very small options for autorun of the extortionist, through Winlogon at the moment starts a very small part of the extortionists; <br>  Kaspersky Rescue Disk detects only a certain number of malware, and since  they appear ‚Äúwith a new face‚Äù every day, then such a search is often ineffective.

    <h4>  AntiWinLocker LiveCD </h4><br>  This is the very first known attempt to create a universal means to remove ransomware.  Contains ‚ÄúAutomatic Mode‚Äù and ‚ÄúManual‚Äù.  For the inexperienced user, ‚ÄúAuto mode‚Äù is more suitable, and in ‚ÄúManual‚Äù it is unlikely that he will be able to do something useful for his computer - it is intended for advanced users. <br>  <b>Proceed to the pluses:</b> <br>  Automatic removal of ransomware; <br>  Ability to remove boot ransomware by replacing the boot sector with a standard one. <br>  <b>Let's go to the minuses:</b> <br>  Automatic removal of ransomware does not help in every case of infection; <br>  Overwriting the boot sector to the standard one in some cases can cause the system to be reinstalled; <br>  Manual removal mode is unlikely to be useful in the hands of an inexperienced user, and they are the main victims of extortionists. <br><br><h4>  AntiSMS utility </h4><br>  This utility appeared quite recently and has not yet gained such popularity as the two above.  But the utility has several advantages.  AntiSMS is an attempt to create an absolutely universal means to fight extortionists.  The treatment is carried out in one click with the mouse. <br>  <b>Proceed to the pluses:</b> <br>  Absolutely automatic cure, which does not require special knowledge from the user, and this is the main plus, and all the advantages below are inside this plus; <br>  intellectual processing of so many variants of the startup of the malware, which allows you to effectively remove ransomware; <br>  recovery of infected (damaged) system files; <br>  signature treatment of boot extortionists, which allows for a complete and correct cure; <br>  cure blockers that spoil the partition table; <br>  restores registry settings that spoil extortionists; <br>  LiveCD takes about 30 megabytes, which is not comparable to the LiveCD utilities discussed above; <br>  there is a utility for simple recording LiveCD on a flash drive. <br>  <b>Let's go to the minuses:</b> <br>  in the process of testing, I did not find any minuses in this program as part of the problem of fighting extortionists and similar Trojans. <br><br>  As a result of my brief review: I advise you to use personal AntiSMS, since  This utility removes extortionists more effectively, even in the hands of an inexperienced user.  But after the system returns to a working state, you should check your computer with a free anti-virus scanner, for example, Dr.Web CureIt! .. <br><br>  References: <br>  <a href="http://support.kaspersky.ru/viruses/solutions%3Fqid%3D208641245">Kaspersky WindowsUnlocker</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.antiwinlocker.ru/download.html">AntiWinLocker LiveCD</a> <br>  <a href="http://forum.simplix.ks.ua/viewtopic.php%3Fid%3D399%26p%3D1">AntiSMS LiveCD</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/145765/">https://habr.com/ru/post/145765/</a></p>
