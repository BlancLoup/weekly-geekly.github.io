Unlike all the others, the company has developed all these years with the founders' money.  But it becomes clear how Figma with a total of $ 82.9 million bypasses them at the turn. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8a2/4d6/58e/8a24d658e2a74559e7b0054c218b65d5.png"><br><br>  The guys teased plans for the year - a browser-based version with collaboration, transfer of layouts out of the box, command tariffs and space in the cloud.  True, the pace is still not fire - the first version in the browser is promised only by the end of the year.  During this time, Figma will make a lot of turns around the earth. <br><br><h4>  Adobe XD </h4><br>  <a href="https://theblog.adobe.com/xd-march-2019-update-vectors-font-management-import-export/">March update</a> .

Strong for a relatively simple service that is not a standalone tool. <br><br><h4>  <a href="https://blocsapp.com/">Blocs</a> </h4><br>  Another design tool focused on responsive sites.  Based on the idea of ‚Äã‚Äã"belts" that can be moved up and down the page - like the usual Tilda or Squarespace. <br><br><h4>  <a href="https://www.haikuforteams.com/">Haiku animator</a> </h4><br>  The tool focused on interface animation and renamed accordingly. <br><br><h4>  Supernova </h4><br>  <a href="https://blog.prototypr.io/introducing-all-new-supernova-also-ycombinator-88a4d0fb24dd">Seriously updated technical stuffing</a> . <br><br><h3>  User research and analytics </h3><br><h4>  <a href="https://uxcam.com/">UXCam App Analytics - Deliver the perfect app experience</a> </h4><br>  User analytics service.  Focuses on the study of specific sessions using the site or application. <br><br><h4>  <a href="https://ux.shopify.com/8-things-i-wish-id-known-about-open-card-sorting-bdcd976a72c2">8 things I wish</a> </h4><br>  Tips Sam Yuan from Shopify for competent preparation, conduct and processing of the results of card sorting. <br><br><h4>  <a href="https://www.userfocus.co.uk/articles/preference-testing-is-not-A-B-testing.html">Repeat after me - Preference testing</a> </h4><br>  David Travis's Golden Words from Userfocus: stop asking the user what design they like.  This gives false results that create the illusion of making decisions based on data. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/857/7a3/412/8577a3412c884c48d69ed5219e07ba09.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Usabilla </h4><br>  <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/05/surveymonkey-acquires-web-survey-company-usabilla-for-80m/">Tool bought SurveyMonkey</a> . <br><br><h4>  <a href="https://measuringu.com/grids-responses/">Do Survey Grids Affect Responses?</a> </h4><br>  Jeff Sauro wonders whether the placement of questions in questionnaires on the same page or different influences the answers of users.  In general, not much, although one page pages slightly worsen the ratings. <br><br><h3>  Visual programming and browser design </h3><br><h4>  New scripts </h4><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://tympanus.net/codrops/2019/02/27/text-trail-effect/">Simple kinetic typography effect</a> . </li><li>  <a href="https://tympanus.net/codrops/2019/03/12/image-distortion-effects-with-svg-filters/">Effective image distortion on promotional sites</a> . </li><li>  <a href="https://github.com/victordibia/handtracking">Manage the page in the browser using gestures</a> .  <a href="https://hackernoon.com/handtrackjs-677c29c1d585">Instructions</a> . </li><li>  <a href="https://tympanus.net/codrops/2019/03/26/exploding-3d-objects-with-three-js/">Splitting 3D objects for promotional sites</a> . </li></ul><br><h3>  Metrics and ROI </h3><br><h4>  <a href="https://measuringu.com/ux-measurement-purpose/">What is the purpose of the UX Measurement?</a> </h4><br>  Jeff Sauro's useful reminder of why UX measurements are made at all, on what principles they work and what answers can be obtained with their help.  How to choose the right metrics and how to associate interface changes with their improvement. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/755/cb5/d5b/755cb5d5b26f21b87913f52ca97aac89.png"><br><br><h4>  <a href="https://measuringu.com/labeling-nps-effects/">Effects of Labeling the Neutral Response in the NPS</a> </h4><br>  Jeff Sauro investigated the extent to which a clear indication of a neutral rating on the NPS scale affects the distribution of ratings.  For active users or recent buyers there is no difference, but for those who have not used it for a long time, there is a shift. <br><br><h3>  Design Management and DesignOps </h3><br><h4>  <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/design-interviewing-ask-me-anything-6633e8413291">Design interviewing - Ask me anything</a> </h4><br>  Powerful interview instruction from Kurt Varner from Dropbox.  Many clever advice on issues, format, portfolio, test, screening and other aspects of the process. <br><br><h4>  <a href="http://uxpamagazine.org/aux3-making-ux-research-track-with-agile/">AUX3 - Making the UX Research Track with Agile</a> </h4><br>  Carol J. Smith, Thyra Rauch and Hannah Moyers describe in detail the model for integrating user research into the canonical agile process.  These are three types of work (learning, problem solving and execution), for each of which an example of real tasks is shown. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2ef/2d2/d74/2ef2d2d7411d9af2c2e7cc497025cd36.jpg"><br><br><h4>  <a href="https://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2019/03/lead-dont-manage-part-1.php">Lead, Don't Manage, Part 1</a> </h4><br>  Jim Nieters writes about the difference between a leader and a manager.  Why it is important to save creative professionals from fear and other aspects of the work of a good leader. <br><br><h4>  <a href="http://uxpamagazine.org/forge-a-guild-elevate-your-ux-team-to-superhero-status/">Forge a Guild - Elevate Your UX Team to Superhero Status</a> </h4><br>  Jennifer Bullard and Carol Bergantino from Veracode talk about the creation of the UX-guild in the company, largely working on scalable agile (there are separate product groups by function, although the designers are in a centralized team).  There are not enough designers at all, so they focused on training non-designers so that product groups are more independent and give a suitable result. <br><br><h4>  <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90315699/how-to-design-the-end-of-a-studios-life">A guide to starting your own design studio from Hawraf</a> </h4><br>  Hawraf Design Studio has made a noisy with its open approach in recent years.  They decided to close the company, but <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1wBlDBNJI3h1KL-jeFqGiRr1U3OZDBQkV">published all the working documents</a> .  Design process, work with the client, etc. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ad9/83b/8ab/ad983b8ab03bc076b7d16425a1025751.png"><br><br><h4>  <a href="http://yellowstroke.com/2019/03/09/a-framework-to-give-better-design-feedback/">Analyze, Discuss, Suggest</a> </h4><br>  Budi Tanrim has an interesting approach to design criticism.  He divides the meeting into three parts (analysis, discussion, and suggestions) and proposes the right balance of time between them. <br><br><h4>  <a href="https://ux.shopify.com/how-to-plot-the-course-for-successful-mentorship-e0f41ddddfd8">A dialogue between a mentor and mentee</a> </h4><br>  An example of a dialogue between a mentor and his client after internship.

Cool immersion in the real world. <br><br><h4>  <a href="https://medium.com/front-conference/designing-with-intuition-edc569d80c83">Designing with Intuition</a> </h4><br>  Vicki Tan talks about the redesign of the process of meeting a new user in the Headspace meditation application.  How they found the key metric and experimented around it. <br><br><h3>  Trends </h3><br><h4>  Market statistics </h4><br>  <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/03/13/smartphone-sales-china-plummet/">drop in smartphone sales in China</a> -20% <br>  <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/03/05/wearable-market-2018-growth/">Wearable device sales in the world grew</a> 31.4% <br>  <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/03/26/sony-4-2-million-playstation-vr-headset-sales/">sold Playstation VR</a> 4.2M helmets <br><br><h4>  <a href="https://vk.com/%40pdigest-trends-2019-true">Technological, interface and visual trends in design</a> </h4><br>  John Maeda has released a fresh annual report <a href="https%253A%252F%252Fdesignintech.report%252F2019%252F03%252F09%252Fdesign-in-tech-report-2019%252F%26cc_key%3D">Design in Tech Report</a> .  This year, a compilation of noticeable news in a professional community is more likely than an analysis of insights, as it was in the first years and what you usually expect from new issues.  Well, the ntivka initiatives of its current company Automattic (creators of WordPress). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b8d/020/6bb/b8d0206bbf5653b2deec4177bcfc8766.png"><br><br>  In general, I do not really believe in annual reviews of trends (although, of course, I <a href="https://vk.com/%40pdigest-trends-2019">review those that come out</a> ( <a href="https://vk.com/%40pdigest-summary-2018">more</a> )) - the industry is changing more slowly.  Many of the trends are developing and live in ascending form for a couple of years, so you see them wandering into such reports from year to year (virtual and augmented reality, for example).  Some like ‚Äúanimations‚Äù, ‚Äúlarge typography‚Äù or ‚Äúbackground videos‚Äù have already become clich√© in the spirit of the gigs of Benny Hill and our grandchildren will probably have to read about them.  Therefore, I divide design trends into three types: technological, interface and visual. <br><br><h4>  <a href="https://www.ibm.com/design/v1/language/experience/vrar/">IBM AR / VR Design Language</a> </h4><br>  IBM guidelines on virtual and augmented reality interfaces. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fc0/294/806/fc0294806d8232b34103a23fc86dcd2d.png"><br><br><h4>  <a href="https://medium.com/microsoft-design/beyond-vision-sound-design-as-sensory-design-3259a8ca59ea">Beyond Vision - Sound Design as Sensory Design</a> </h4><br>  Matthew Bennett, head of sound and touch design at Microsoft, talks about his vision of the role of sound in interfaces and digital products in general.
