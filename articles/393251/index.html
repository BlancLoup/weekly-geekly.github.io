He knows about him, about her, about all of us.  He can not be stopped, because he is not a man, he is a mechanism.  If you do not keep the law, kill, rob, rape, it will save the world from you.  After all, you are a threat to society, you should not be in this World. </blockquote><br><hr><br><h4>  Prologue </h4><br>  - Oh, Artist!  Hello! <br>  - Healthy.  How long have I not seen you, how are you? <br>  - Yeah ... I am perfectly in order, there was a lot of work, I had to check something ... By the way, did you finish what I asked you? <br>  - And what, for you anything!  - He smiled and looked at the table. <br>  - Oh, is this a finished program, or just its code? <br>  - Source.  But for you, my friend, is written in the best possible way!  As usual. <br>  - Oh, in vain it is you so ... But if so, let's get it here, I will finish it myself.  - Involuntarily smiled. <br>  - Well, yes, you have a master of your craft. <br>  - Yeah. <br><br>  Stepping out the door, the young man heard a sharp, loud sound.  It was a blast. <br>  "It seems that you are no longer with us, my friend, Artist." - The boy thought, grinning.  - ‚ÄúHe spoke, for good reason!‚Äù <br><br>  ‚ÄúNow you need to be hidden,‚Äù he said, looking at the little flash drive in his hand.  Quickly examining the corridor, he found a suitable slot in which it was not difficult to hide the USB flash drive.  After a simple manipulation of the wall, he nodded in satisfaction and disappeared from the scene of the crime. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  A minute later, the Secret Squad of Information Security entered the recreation area at the time it was headed by a very clever, but strange type.  He was dressed in a black raincoat, under the raincoat the standard equipment of an ISIS employee was hidden: a police bulletproof vest and a pistol of the Glock 18 model. The only distinctive feature of his attire was a scarf that hides half of his face.  The commander went to a freshly hidden cache in the slot and pulled out a flash card.

      ‚ÄúYou thought you could hide this treasure from me?‚Äù  No, I'm smarter.  - He broke up in a joyful smile. <br>  - Andrei, what is it? <br>  - This is power, Mikhail Sergeyevich, a huge power! <br>  - Is power in a small flash card?  Do not make me laugh! <br>  - Heh, my friend, you do not know what is written on this little chip. <br>  - Well, that's your business.  - Mikhail no longer asked questions, knowing full well that the commander would not say anything anyway. <br>  - Yes.  It's my business.  We leave, we have nothing more to do here, and it is dangerous to be here. <br><br>  When the detachment retired, a certain man, of medium height, came out from behind the door and smiled: "Well, Andrei, you finally caught my virus."  - After that, quietly went outside. <br>  While strolling, he noticed that people no longer paid attention to the building, in which there was an explosion just a couple of minutes ago.  Everyone went their own way, probably very important, in a hurry, but why?  After a couple of hours will no longer have to hurry, nowhere.  All change.  People will turn into slaves, their own technology!  Everything will be in electronic form: money, a passport and even emotions will be recorded in the form of zeros and ones, and later processed by the highest authorities.  This will be a revolution in the development of mankind.  Everyone will have a personal communicator, and it will be absolutely free.  All in all, some pathetic prototype of modern smartphones.  But the main thing in it is a single telecom operator and one common system called ‚ÄúZone‚Äù.  Everyone in the city will have their own individual code, similar to an IP address, in the format of four values ‚Äã‚Äãseparated from each other by a dot.  Only values ‚Äã‚Äãare not assigned randomly.  The first three digits of the number are the country, the second are the region or the region, the third row is the city or village, and the remaining values ‚Äã‚Äãare the social insurance number. <br><br><h4>  Department of ISIB.  - 29.03 </h4><br>  - Captain, everything is ready to launch. <br>  - Well!  Now it will be a new world.  Run! <br>  - The launch of the program has begun.  - Notified pleasant, feminine voice.  - <br>  ‚ÄúThe operating system change was successful. <br>  The management transfer of the ISMS system has been successfully completed. <br>  ZONE Welcomes you. <br>  Authorization of security systems of other countries is completed. <br>  Satellite update completed. ‚Äù <br><br>  - Now the whole system ISIB under the authority of "Zone".  Said the Captain. <br>  The program quickly reached the whole world, distributed its numbers to all countries and regions and immediately sent this list to a common database.  Each person received their individual number.  Everything went in a matter of seconds, as if it had been ready for a long time ... <br><br>  Panic was only a week, but as you know, people quickly get used to the new and this system is no exception.  They understood how comfortable she was, but many guessed that they were being watched and everyone saw: actions, emotions, incomes and expenses.  It strained.  But now there are no more crowds of people, on which the fate of humanity depends.  Only a team of five or ten people per country.  And this is enough to support a single world economy.  Only one single body for catching criminals!  But, as in any other world, there are those who are not satisfied with this policy.  There will always be people who are ready to change the world, and for the better, you decide.  In the meantime, our story begins, the story that I see it. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/393251/">https://habr.com/ru/post/393251/</a></p>
