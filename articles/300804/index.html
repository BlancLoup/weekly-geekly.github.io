  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Why is important the mission in the issue of communications of the company management and consumers</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Good afternoon, dear readers of Megamind! <br><br>  I continue a series of articles about the creation and development of the company. <br>  Earlier, I said that the creation and declaration of a mission is one of the most important factors in the creation and development of a company.  In this and subsequent articles I will describe in detail the reason for this importance.  And today I will talk about the primary function of the mission - communication between the manufacturer and the buyer. <br><a name="habracut"></a>  The mission connects management (owners) with the end user.  Just imagine: once again you entered a sausage shop, maybe even a large chain store, with your production, bought your favorite sausage, came home, started to eat it ... and realized that the taste was different.  Probably even worse, and not just another.  And what can we think of after realizing this fact?  ‚ÄúOh, everything always gets worse, and will I still buy it?‚Äù Or ‚ÄúIt got worse and my legs won't be in that store anymore‚Äù?  These are the most common reactions to deterioration.  Indeed, remember the top five favorite products that have been buying steadily over the past few years.  Are there any such products?  And if you remember more than five? <br><br>  But what else can we do, moreover, how to accept or stop using? 
      <br>

      <br>
      What about direct contact with management? <br><br>  But modern companies do not provide such an opportunity, and only those who have a feedback form on the website have gone as far forward as possible.  But for the relationship between the buyer and the seller, even if it sells and produces different people, all links in the chain ‚Äúmachine-package buyer‚Äù, and especially the sellers in the store, should be responsible.  And at the same time I understand perfectly well that these sellers rarely have a tool for transmitting complaints and suggestions to their management, and such complaints only take away their time, nerves and energy.  And buyers understand this, so they have no desire to advise something. <br><br>  But the buyer has no other opportunity to contact, except as a seller in the store.  And this seller should also be responsible for the product, as well as the manufacturer, at least within the framework of the sale.  If the seller does not want this, then he is not ready to provide quality service.  If he wants, but he cannot, let him change his place of work.  The question is certainly acute, in the period of reduction and reduction of vacancies, but there is always something to improve (about this in the next article). <br><br>  A good solution to this problem is the communication of the management with its customers, initiated by the management itself.  The mission in this case is the meaning of the existence of the company and the production of products that will answer many questions from customers, and set the vector of conversation. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/300804/">https://habr.com/ru/post/300804/</a></p>
