  <section class="page js-page"><h1>New Year's agitation or hosting free then</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Some time ago I <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/hosting/52591/">wrote</a> about an interesting hybrid of hosting and VPS from DreamHost.  For our market of mass hosting, the offers of this company are expensive (their standard price is 10 USD per month hosting plus 15 more per VPS).  Being one of the leaders in the west, they nevertheless can afford stunning New Year actions.  Actually, I wanted to talk briefly about the main one: <br><br>  At the moment, the unlimited plan (without VPS) is available for 1 year for $ 9.24 (ie 77 cents per month) if you specify the share code "777", this corresponds to a discount of more than 90% + 1 com / net / org domain is included in the price <br><br>  I think it is not necessary to say that the ratio of price and quality in this case is off the scale.  I would not like to dwell on the details of the tariff - the <a href="http://www.dreamhost.com/hosting.html">details page</a> is replete with the number of Unlimited, in general, the plan can be briefly described as ‚ÄúAll inclusive without restrictions‚Äù with the addition ‚ÄúDo not be impudent!‚Äù.

      Details under the cut <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  You can argue about the possibility of no-limit in budget hosting - but in practice, if you do not set a goal to devour more resources, then claims from hosting can be avoided.  Personally, I recently kept more than 100GB of files on my account and spent up to 10TB of traffic.  In addition to the profitability of the offer, you should pay attention to a number of rare for mass hosting of chips: <br><br>  Equipment: <br>  1. A full shell (by the way, there is Debian) with SFTP, with djp the ability to run long-running software and demons (the latter is not welcomed by the rules, I did not notice the limit for the execution time).  Torrent clients are prohibited by rules. <br>  2. The disk subsystem is organized on the SAN, problems with quotas and brakes disappear.  As it should be allocated cluster under MySQL / Mail / etc <br>  3. In addition to PHP4-5, Ruby on Rails is provided, Perl, Python, C, C ++ are available on CGI. <br>  4. CVS and SVN repositories (limited availability) <br>  5. You can enable and configure WebDAV methods for selected folders. <br>  6. Streaming RealAudio / RealVideo (via HTTP) and QuickTime streaming server based on Darwin, media converter for streaming to Flash <br>  7. Personal Jabber Chat Server <br>  8. The ability to obtain resource reservations (VPS) from the quarry <br><br>  Organizational: <br>  1. Adequate and professional support (Los Angeles), not stundents and not Indians <br>  2. Guarantee 100% infrastructure uptime, add hosting day for an hour of inactivity <br>  3. Refund without any questions (give three months for reflection!) <br>  4. DreamHost for 80 cents per month !!!  What can we say <br><br>  Just in case, I will add that I have no relation to <a href="http://dreamhost.com/">DreamHost</a> , I do not pursue my interests, I am a happy client and I recommend to others <br><br>  <b>UPD</b> The registration process I had was: <br>  1. Enter the code and personal data and order hosting for 1 year.  Some people get an error that the code is incompatible with the region.  There are two ways out - go under another IP (some Russians work and probably all Western ones) or use another promo code, 777 gives $ 110 discounts, if nothing happened <s>contact me, there are promotional codes for $ 97 discount without restrictions on regions</s> tcnm many promo codes $ 50 discounts <br>  2. When registering, ask to specify a credit card to confirm identity.  In the first week, they must withdraw $ 9.24 from it, if there is no balance on the card or if it hasn‚Äôt passed for another reason - there are payment methods on PayPal, Google Checkout and a few more options in the panel <br>  3. If for some reason you were charged more - billing support should quickly fix it, do not forget about your right to a full refund within 97 days from the date of subscription (does not work for PayPal), your money will not go anywhere <br><br>  <b>UPD2</b> Servers are in the states, so that with a wares and easily compromised services (such as hiding links) there may be a beater <br><br>  <b>UPD3</b> Promotional codes created at a discount of 97 USD may be discounted for only 50 USD, it looks like a new bonus policy.  Several old promotional codes for 97 USD are present <a href="http://ahappycustomer.dreamhosters.com/dreamhost-coupons.html">HERE</a> , I ask who has not yet registered to check them.  If you used the code TDZ4HABR, check the receipt of the full bonus.  Old promotional codes before the introduction of this restriction can be viewed in the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/hosting/52591/">old post</a> , perhaps this restriction does not apply to the old codes.  It is not applicable to code 777 described in this article, as it is given a discount of 110 USD as before <br><br>  <b>UPD4</b> If during registration you missed the promo code field and subscribed to the regular tariff you can contact the support and ask to add it, but several people have already refused, so it seems more reasonable to close the account (there is a button in the panel for this) and open a new one with a promotional code ( I think you need another mail).  The first week (with promotional codes two) are considered trial, at this time you can cancel your account without any risk.  You can later claim money back through the money back policy. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/79899/">https://habr.com/ru/post/79899/</a></p>
