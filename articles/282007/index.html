We are extremely skeptical of all new products that help to solve everything at once, and prefer not to trust, but to check.  However, the recently announced VxRail caught our attention.  The device has already managed to gain popularity in a few months, and we decided to find out why.  After a little analysis, we present you a list of the main problems inherent in data centers, which VxRail helps to solve. </p><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><p>  More recently, the overwhelming majority of specialists turned to convergent and hyper-convergent data center infrastructures, which for some time helped to solve this dilemma.  Convergent and hyperconvergent systems quickly adapt <nobr>because of</nobr> their maneuverability, reliability, simplicity and cost-effectiveness compared to autonomous systems. </p><br><br><p>  In early 2016, VCE launched VxRail, an application for hyperconverged data centers suitable for medium and large data centers, as well as remote corporate locations.  VxRail attracted a lot of attention due to several impressive features, including best-in-class performance, scalability and the fact that it uses any VMware tools that are already running. <img src="http://habr.habrastorage.org/post_images/330/ed7/08a/330ed708a1aa493498f25de98a59cf09.gif"></p>

    <p>  We agree that VxRail is the ideal solution for many companies, and now we will tell you why.  Here are 5 sores of any data center, which we so often hear in conversations with our colleagues and partners, and which are amenable to this new vaccine - VxRail. </p><br><br><h3>  And the years are flying, or our data center is obsolete </h3><br><p>  Many <nobr>IT professionals</nobr> prefer to use virtualized computing resources, but keep the storage and network separately. <br>  Others face a tremendous amount of problems with their DIY systems and standalone applications.  Outdated technologies are quite complex and expensive.  Plug-in devices for a hyper-converged infrastructure (such as VxRail) are a quick and cost-effective way to unify, virtualize, and quickly automate the entire system. </p><br><br><h3>  Memory fails, or we need better storage. </h3><br><p>  One of the things that we like most about VxRail compared to other hyper-converged infrastructure applications is the capabilities it provides for memory and storage.  VxRail has a lot of bells and whistles in this area, but we believe that the main three of them deserve attention. <br><br>  <nobr>First</nobr> , VxRail provides several cloud storage options: you can integrate it with public or private cloud resources, and it will work as a boxed hybrid cloud to support tasks such as development / testing. <br><br>  <nobr>Secondly</nobr> , you can configure VxRail with a set of flash and hard drives or deploy it as a <nobr>flash array</nobr> . <br><br>  <nobr>Thirdly</nobr> , VxRail has online deduplication, which creates space savings of up to 50%: this is really valuable for enterprises with a high degree of data unification. </p><br><br><h3>  We do not see forests for trees, or instead of business development, we spend all the resources to support the data center </h3><br><p>  If this is your case, then VxRail will change the situation.  Optimizing the system and maintaining its performance is much easier with VxRail thanks to its integrated performance monitoring panel.  When it comes to saving time, VxRail automates more than 200 tasks related to lifecycle management, which also reduces total cost of ownership.  For data protection, backup copies of virtual machines are created;  The recovery itself takes place in one stage - 30% faster than in mid-level systems, and you can recover at any time.  Windows backup shrinks and requires less storage space. </p><br><br><h3>  And on the Christmas tree to climb, and ... Or there is no time for complex configuration and deployment </h3><br><p>  We understand you.  Any provider hears such wishes from many partners who want to deal with the migration process and set up on their own.  VxRail in this regard also looks advantageous because it is easy to install.  Data migration is very simple, and the first virtual machine will be set up in 15 minutes: one of the fastest uptimes on the market.  You can deploy VxRail separately or use it in combination with <nobr>VCE blocks</nobr> to take the best from converged and hyper-convergent infrastructures.  Any of these solutions are easy to deploy, and deployment has virtually no risk due to technical VCE standards and dual technical support. </p><br><br><h3>  No money - no honey, or limited budget </h3><br><p>  Scalable flexible systems are the key to obtaining the desired system at an affordable price and ensure the prospects of investments.  An added bonus is getting rid of the risk of forecasting resources.  VxRail provides a wealth of options to meet current demand and scale to a level that a company will need later (VxRail can expand to 3,000 virtual machines).  You can mix and match four VxRail models into a cluster. </p><br><br><p>  Modern <nobr>IT specialists</nobr> are increasingly engaged in over-tying the rope: on the one hand, the desire to ensure the flawless functioning of its <nobr>data center infrastructure</nobr> , on the other, the desire to expand it for business competitiveness and employee satisfaction.  Everyone is looking for inexpensive and reliable solutions to get out of this impasse.  In our opinion, VxRail is, if not a panacea, then, in any case, a good enough tool for satisfying both needs. </p></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/282007/">https://habr.com/ru/post/282007/</a></p>
