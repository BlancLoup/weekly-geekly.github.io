Here are some criteria that customers and designers often apply: <br><br><ul><li>  Own experience - "it turned out on the past site, it will turn out now"; </li><li>  Expert opinions and information from the articles - ‚Äúthe phone must be in the header‚Äù, ‚Äúbe sure to implement the product comparison module‚Äù; </li><li>  Opinions of authoritative employees - ‚Äúthe designer said that you need to post news in the left block‚Äù; </li><li>  Comparison with competitors - ‚Äúcompany N has a module of the favorites on the site, their website sells, which means we also need it‚Äù. </li></ul><a name="habracut"></a><br>  If the site is aimed at sales and is not a well-known brand, then such a justification will not be enough.  Each block of the site, each change should be described in terms of its contribution to the conversion. <br><br>  As a model for evaluating this contribution, you can use the <b>STM</b> model (Satisfaction, Trust, Motivation), which allows you to classify each element and filter if it does not carry any conversion benefits. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      Based on the theory of STM, each element that affects the conversion can be classified according to one of three basic metrics: customer satisfaction in information, trust in the seller, or motivation to buy.  Let's take a closer look at them: <br><br><h3>  1. Satisfaction (satisfaction) </h3><br>  A rational user will not make purchases until he receives answers to his questions.  When will the delivery be?  Who else did they work with?  What happens if I don't like it?  Can I buy on credit?  Is it the same dress, but green?  The more answers you give on your site, the more you get the conversion.  The more objections you can process on the site pages, the more confidence the visitor will have before ordering.  No need to think that the user will necessarily call to specify the price and delivery time - many will simply leave the site, continuing to search the search engine. <br><br><h3>  2. Trust </h3><br>  The user will make the target action on the site (call, leave contacts or place an order in the basket) only after he has confidence in the company-seller.  In services, this is usually done with the help of separate blocks in which the company talks about its experience, achievements, and indeed about everything connected with it, demonstrating its reputation. <br><br><h3>  3. Motivation to action (motivation) </h3><br>  Profitable offers, promotions, discounts and in general all possible rewards usually work on the motivation to buy.  Loyalty programs in the form of accrual of bonuses or accumulation of points that can be exchanged for goods in the future also fall into this category.  Look, for example, landings made in the style of ‚ÄúStore on the couch‚Äù - they are oversaturated with motivation to buy - 2 gifts only when ordering for 10 minutes, the second watch is free, 90% discount only today and so on. <br><br>  As an example, we have two videos of analysts, recorded through a favorite tool of analysts - ‚ÄúWebvisor‚Äù Yandex Metrics. <br><br>  <b>Given: a</b> user who is at the stage of selecting a seller of a particular product, namely, a closet.  Search query - "wardrobe bert√© bis buy wardrobe".  The first site to which he moved is at the 26th place in the issue on this request, the second at 31. <br><br>  Let's see how the visitor behaved on the first site. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y9zy1sbDuGw" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  What can we say about this behavior?  The page seems to have all the information about the model.  Ability to select material.  Resizing  Lack of "extra" information.  The first conclusion we made was that the price tag did not suit the visitor, so he went looking further and got to another monitored site. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/encIQKyPE5w" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Here he was much more and even made an order.  Please note that the price tag is a third higher than the previous one and yet it did not scare away the visitor.  During the first viewing of the product, the user specifies information on the delivery, assembly and payment within the commodity card and proceeds to the choice of material (the selection button is highlighted in color).  Then he places the order almost immediately and goes on a journey through the site in search of something else.  But more orders do not. <br><br>  Based on these two records, we can build theories, which will require full A / B testing to confirm.  Now we can only assume that the user on the first site did not accept the suspicious price, a third below the market, he needed those blocks that are on the second site, and the first is not ... so all possible trifles can be considered. <br><br>  But considering that the person flipped through the issue up to 4 pages and we found something that was not there before - a reason to test and compare sites from the issue. <br><br>  Below we have tried to classify according to the STM model a familiar list of factors that may affect the conversion: <br><table><tbody><tr><td>  <b>Factor</b> </td><td width="175">  <b>Satisfaction</b> </td><td width="100">  <b>The trust</b> </td><td width="120">  <b>Motivation to action</b> </td></tr><tr><td>  <b>The range</b> - the more products on the site, the higher the likelihood that the user will make a purchase on it. <br></td><td>  + </td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>  <b>Goods</b> - the more useful information about the product in the card, the fewer questions the visitor will have and the higher the likelihood that they will get it.  Empty product cards cause mistrust. <br></td><td>  + </td><td>  + </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>  <b>Shares</b> - the presence of stocks and lucrative offers are often a kind of "hook" for the user.  Especially if they are selected taking into account viewed sections on the site. <br></td><td></td><td></td><td>  + </td></tr><tr><td>  <b>Discount Items</b> <br></td><td></td><td></td><td>  + </td></tr><tr><td>  <b>Gifts, the possibility of receiving services or goods for free</b> <br></td><td></td><td></td><td>  + </td></tr><tr><td>  <b>Rating of goods, hits of sales, sorting by popularity</b> - push the buyer to the right choice, favorable to you <br></td><td></td><td></td><td>  + </td></tr><tr><td>  <b>Description of services</b> - the text should answer all the user's questions as fully as possible (even those that he could ask six months after the purchase), respond to a maximum of objections, have a ‚Äúhuman‚Äù character, and not a collection of key phrases diluted with pretexts. <br></td><td>  + </td><td>  + </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>  <b>Detailed contacts</b> - the more different communication methods, the greater the possible conversion.  The more information about the company's offices and employees, the greater the confidence. <br></td><td>  + </td><td>  + </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>  <b>Feedback form / call order / online consultant</b> - at any time visiting the user may have questions, the answer to which he wants to get as soon as possible. <br></td><td>  + </td><td>  + </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>  <b>Download speed - the faster individual pages load, the less annoyance this causes to visitors.</b> <br></td><td>  + </td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>  <b>Clear structure (navigation)</b> - no need to confuse visitors, navigation should be simple and intuitive. <br></td><td>  + </td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>  <b>The list of viewed products</b> - when there are a large number of positions on the site, then the user, moving through categories, may find it difficult to return to the product where he liked something.  The ability to save items to lists (for example, ‚Äúmy wishes‚Äù) increases the satisfaction factor. <br></td><td>  + </td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>  <b>The possibility of comparing products</b> - when a large assortment is presented on the site, the user can decide for a long time, choosing between a certain number of products.  Having the ability to compare them on one page, he can quickly make a decision, thereby satisfying his need. <br></td><td>  + </td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>  <b>"Basket"</b> - the ability to order several products from the usual form of a basket has long become the standard of online stores. <br></td><td>  + </td><td>  + </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>  <b>Attractiveness</b> - a nice graphic design that matches the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe brand, causes the user confidence and desire to explore the site more deeply. <br></td><td>  + </td><td>  + </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>  <b>Privacy</b> - users will always worry about their personal data.  If the site does not say anything about their further use, then the visitor will have little confidence in such a site. <br></td><td>  + </td><td>  + </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>  <b>Security</b> - over the years, users are becoming more aware.  Now many, seeing the https protocol, instead of http, trust the visited resource more.  The contribution is made by search engines that mark sites with malicious content, anti-virus system plug-ins, checking sites and crowd-rating services like WOT. <br></td><td></td><td>  + </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>  <b>Customer reviews, social evidence</b> - if the site has customer reviews, then this tells the visitor that some people have already used the services of this company and are quite satisfied (if the reviews are positive of course). <br></td><td>  + </td><td>  + </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>  <b>Certificates / certificates / awards</b> - availability of information on the company's merits on the website entails an increase in the level of trust. <br></td><td></td><td>  + </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>  <b>Warranty Information</b> <b><br></b> </td><td>  + </td><td>  + </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>  <b>Information about the rules for returning goods</b> <b><br></b> </td><td>  + </td><td>  + </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>  <b>Information on options and delivery time, availability</b> <b><br></b> </td><td>  + </td><td>  + </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>  <b>The presence of detailed filters in the sections of the catalog</b> - with a large assortment, more filters are needed.  No need to force the user to wander through dozens of pages of a category, take an example from Yandex Market. <br></td><td>  + </td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>  <b>Payment methods</b> - the more payment methods the more users you can reach. <br></td><td>  + </td><td>  + </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>  <b>Portfolio</b> - not necessarily have a huge list of laudable work.  3-5 examples of large campaigns are enough to generate user confidence. <br></td><td>  + </td><td>  + </td><td></td></tr><tr><td> <b>News</b> - news block, with fresh entries, says that the site is relevant and continues to work.  However, if the latest news dates from three months ago, then most likely some of the visitors will leave. <br></td><td></td><td>  + </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>  <b>Presence in social networks</b> - gives confidence to the company and serves as another channel of interaction with the audience. <br></td><td>  + </td><td>  + </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>  <b>Expert opinions</b> - the presence of ratings from professionals or opinion leaders - causes users to trust the product or service. <br></td><td></td><td>  + </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>  <b>Information on the competence of the company</b> - publications, speeches, published books, giving an understanding of the expertise of company employees <br></td><td></td><td>  + </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>  <b>Calls to action</b> - using buttons and headers you can gently push the visitor to the desired action. <br></td><td></td><td></td><td>  + </td></tr></tbody></table><br>  As an example, consider the product page flipkart.com.  In one of the articles on Habr√©, the author considered the design of a selling design using the AIDA model, we also finalized a screenshot broken down by the STM model: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a70/093/507/a70093507e623f1fde92c764f2411c52.png" alt="image"><br><br>  For example, high-quality photos attract attention and at the same time satisfy the user's need for a visual assessment of the product, the action button is the last step in AIDA, and in STM it is tied to motivation, etc. <br><br>  How can I use the STM model? <br><br>  <b>When designing websites, you can use it as a sieve.</b> <br><br>  if the entered block on the site cannot be attributed to any of the characteristics of the STM, most likely it will be useless.  For example, in the prototype site, you can sign the letters S, T, M to each designed block.  It should be noted that there may be exceptions related to the emotional and psychological impact on the visitor and some others. <br><br>  Another way to apply it is to <b>classify businesses</b> by the degree of influence of each STM characteristic.  For example, for special equipment sellers, trust is not a significant characteristic, but for franchise sellers, it is one of the key. <br><br>  <b>When discussing changes to the site by the customer or planning these changes in the studio</b> <br><br>  If you ask yourself the question: will this edit affect the user's satisfaction, his trust in us or the motivation to buy?  - it is impossible to give a definite answer, it should not be contributed.  This refers to the game with fonts, colors, ‚Äúmake a red bold phone in the cap‚Äù and so on.  Only conversion and maximum efficiency. <br><br>  When planning a split test.  Perhaps adding another motivation block will be more productive than the color test of the ‚ÄúBuy‚Äù button? <br><br>  <b>When developing assessors instructions</b> <br><br>  Now the search engines set themselves the task - to give users the first sites on which they will be more likely to make an order.  ‚ÄúYandex‚Äù has introduced commercial ranking factors, ‚ÄúGoogle‚Äù in its own way takes into account the trust and satisfaction of users in the construction of the Top.  Each characteristic relating to the STM model can be assessed on a 5-point scale and trained on such estimates machine ranking algorithms. <br><br>  This model has long taken root in our company and among some partner studios.  Any editing passing through a sieve is subjected to testing after which it is entered / not entered on the site.  In this way, we increase our own productivity. <br><br>  We hope that this model will be useful to many professionals and will help simplify the work on improving the effectiveness of sites. <br><br>  Team design studio "VladWeb" ( <a href="http://vladwebstudio.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dstatya%26utm_campaign%3DSTM_model">http://vladwebstudio.ru/</a> ): <br><br>  Anton Sinitsyn - SEO Manager <br>  Serov Nikita - SMM / SEO-specialist <br>  Sergey Petukhov - SEO-specialist </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/309632/">https://habr.com/ru/post/309632/</a></p>
