Our service allows you to make purchases on eBay, Taobao, Yahoo, Amazon and in any online stores in the USA, UK, Germany, China and Japan. <br><br><h4>  A barrel of honey </h4><br>  It is 2012, and purchases abroad have already become the norm of online shopping.  Unique gadgets, branded clothing and shoes, musical instruments - all this is much more profitable to buy in foreign stores.  Everyone knows that you can buy goods abroad that cannot be bought in Russia, and some products are 5-8 times cheaper at the same time.

    <h4>  A spoon of tar </h4><br>  But, unfortunately, buyers from Russia (as well as Ukraine and other CIS countries) are limited in their capabilities.  The biggest sales and the biggest discounts are not available to us.  Most online stores and sellers at auctions deliver goods only within their own country, and buyers from Russia cannot buy these goods.  Moreover, such shops do not even accept our plastic cards. <br><br>  What if you found a very interesting product on eBay (or Amazon), but delivery is possible only within the USA?  This is where our <a href="http://ebayworld.ru/">online</a> shopping service will help you - <a href="http://ebayworld.ru/">eBayWorld.ru</a> . <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Online shopping without limits! </h4><br>  Our service removes all restrictions that arise from buyers from Russia.  Want to buy a lot on eBay with delivery within the US?  No problems!  The store does not accept your plastic card?  No problems! <br><br>  We have warehouses in 5 countries: in the USA, Great Britain, Germany, China and Japan.  We buy your goods and deliver them to our warehouse.  All your goods are formed into one general package and sent to your address.  Tracking number is provided for each package.  Everything is very simple and effective! <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b90/14f/2a9/b9014f2a99681d275270338cbe2b7b59.jpg"></div><br><br>  <b>Make purchases through our service in two ways:</b> <br><br>  <b>1 way</b> - you specify the goods you want to order, replenish your internal account and pay the full cost of the goods.  We have a lot of payment methods: WebMoney, Yandex.Money, VISA and MasterCard, bank payment, cash payment, etc.  You do not need to register anywhere and know a foreign language.  Simply select your favorite products and pay for them in any convenient way. <br><br>  <b>2 way</b> - If you know English well, know how to use PayPal and are used to making purchases on your own, then use our ‚ÄúVirtual Address‚Äù service (also known as Mail Forwarding).  You will be able to buy the goods to the address of our warehouse, and we will receive the goods, combine them into one parcel and send you home.  In this case, you need to pay only the cost of the ‚ÄúVirtual Address‚Äù service and the cost of delivery of the parcel at the official rates of the postal service. <br><br><h4>  EBay auction </h4><br>  Our service is specifically tailored for <b>purchases at eBay auction</b> .  We integrated eBay auction catalog, translated it into Russian, built in a convenient search system in Russian and, most importantly, wrote a sniper.  Thanks to the built-in ebay sniper, you can significantly save on purchases.  The sniper makes a bid 5 seconds before the end of the auction, and your opponents simply do not have time to kill your bid. <br><br>  It is very easy to buy on eBay - you find a lot in our catalog (or add it manually, knowing the ‚ÄúItem number‚Äù), specify the maximum price you are willing to spend on buying the lot, and pay for the goods.  Our sniper will bet, and the difference in price will return to your account.  If during the auction the price has risen above your bid, the money will automatically be returned to you. <br><br><h4>  What makes us different from the competition? </h4><ul><li>  <b>No hidden fees</b> and additional charges.  Our rates are simple and transparent. </li><li>  <b>Unlimited possibilities</b> .  We deliver goods from 5 countries (USA, England, Germany, China, Japan) and do not intend to stop there.  We will continue to open new warehouses in new countries, and you will be able to deliver goods from new stores! </li><li>  <b>Discounts and bonuses</b> .  Our regular customers know that it is profitable to cooperate with us.  Promotions, contests, discounts - all this makes overseas shopping even more affordable. </li><li>  <b>Modern technology</b> .
