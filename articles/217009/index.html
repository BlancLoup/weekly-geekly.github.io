For a long time I was looking for something of good quality, wireless (it was a mandatory requirement), I also wanted a ‚Äúwave‚Äù (ala anatomical form), pretty.  At the time of purchase, almost all the catalogs on the Internet were revised and all the characteristics, advantages and disadvantages of almost all available devices (not only on the Ukrainian market, but also those that could be obtained through online stores) were memorized.  As a result, the choice was between this and one of Microsoft natural ergonomic.  And yet Logitech outweighed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3c2/dae/089/3c2dae089d6275f28274796efe68a84a.jpg"><br><br>  Careful, pictures! <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  First, let's take a look at the main characteristics </h4><br>  Full layout <br>  About 15 additional multimedia keys (half of which can be reprogrammed by the user to fit your needs) <br>  Anatomical shape of the keyboard itself (wave) <br>  Soft stand for hands <br>  Height and keystroke average <br>  AA batteries <br>  There are no lights Caps Lock, Num Lock, Scroll Lock.

      I work as a programmer, I also love to cut myself in toys in the evening.  I can say with confidence that this keyboard is fully suitable for this purpose.  It is very convenient to type ten fingers on it, the anatomical location of the keys is also convenient. <br>  I had the usual clavs, with "slanting" buttons, slim, full and middle keystrokes, full, notebook, with a large and small "Enter", with a bunch of multimedia keys and without them at all. <br><br><h4>  About the main keys </h4><br>  In this case, the location of all the buttons is convenient, the key travel is excellent, the fingers do not get tired and do not slide.  I read in a review that if the press is not ideally centered, then they are pressed with a little more effort ‚Äî I personally did not notice this. <br><br>  Space - just huge.  And comfortable.  It is pressed in all places: both at the edges, and from above, and from below. <br><br>  The bottom row of keys increased almost 3 times (Ctrl, Windows, Alt) - just as convenient, I have never accidentally pressed it, but I have never missed a touch in the dark or by touch. <br><br>  The location of the arrows is at first scarecrow, since their easy displacement usually causes discomfort in their use.  However, this time the developers approached it wisely.  There is enough space around the edges so that you don‚Äôt accidentally touch the extra, and the arrow keys are enlarged compared to the letter keys, which also has a positive effect on usability. <br><br>  In the Russian layout, the length of the left ‚ÄúShift‚Äù was reduced in comparison with only the English layout.  They crammed in there not everybody with a useful duplicate key with "/ |" signs, however, due to the fact that the entire keyboard is larger than the standard one, even the trimmed Shift is almost the same size as my A4Tech workbench with uncut.  As for misses in this place, especially when pressing the Ctrl + z / x / c / a combinations - is.  It takes a week.  Then you forget and do not notice.  By the way, there are no problems with using other keyboards. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2d1/5b8/f05/2d15b8f05d631fd8520b94d8ffdaac8b.jpg" width="500"><br><h6>  Front view </h6><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/802/e3a/1f7/802e3a1f78480ea69b86686d405016a8.jpg" width="500"><br><h6>  Large Enter, Delete, Backspace </h6><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/46b/5bc/7e4/46b5bc7e4ab2d2d949ee2a374b1fbf80.jpg" width="500"><br><h6>  Num lock </h6><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/51c/5a4/bb8/51c5a4bb8245a9c956c23d9b9ead8e36.jpg" width="500"><br><h6>  Arrows and battery charge indicator </h6><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9a7/807/50e/9a780750ec260c62b03370f389b1055b.jpg" width="500"><br><h6>  Caps Lock, Shift, enlarged bottom row of keys </h6><br><br><h4>  About noise </h4><br>  I read about the noisiness - yes, the sounds of depression are present, maybe a little more than you expect for such a price, but they absolutely do not irritate and do not interfere, and I personally even like it when you can determine by ear whether the key has reached or not. <br><br><h4>  Pro multimedia keys </h4><br>  About multimedia is a rhetorical question.  Personally, for more than 10 years of using a PC, if I use it, then only the calculator call button. <br><br>  If someone really needs them - do not forget that most of them can be reprogrammed into the necessary commands, so I think it will be completely satisfied.  But do not forget that there is no memory in the clave and the settings are saved in the corresponding program, which can be easily downloaded and installed from the official site.  This means that on the new system you will need to install the program and / or set the settings again, or load a previously saved profile. <br><br>  As for people who don‚Äôt need these additional functions (like me), there‚Äôs absolutely no discomfort: they are arranged so that you don‚Äôt accidentally press them and they don‚Äôt fall into your hands.  I also want to note such an interesting description as ‚ÄúPC off button with protection against accidental pressing‚Äù - it turns out that all buttons have a slight bulge upwards, and there is a recess on this button, which makes it really hard to press it accidentally. <br><br><h4>  About light indication </h4><br>  There is only one small LED - it shows the battery charge.  After a year of use - full. <br><br>  Indications Caps Lock, Num Lock, Scroll Lock - no.  If you have installed the driver, then the display will appear in large gray letters directly on the monitor when you press the corresponding keys, something like this: Caps Lock On / Caps Lock Off.  Personally, I only used it for the first time.  Then I did not install anything, and so well guided.  By the way, because of the floor of the reduced Caps Lock - its accidental pressing is difficult, and if you press it, you feel it.  There are no problems.  However, they could have made three LEDs, which would light up, for example, for 1 second when changing modes, to change batteries more than once every 2 years and a half to one is not such a problem. <br><br><h4>  About Logitech Unify Technology </h4><br>  Due to the fact that it was removed from production, then bought some found.  Got an instance with a non-Unify receiver (Logitech Wave).  With the Unify receiver, this is the Logitech K350.  Externally and in terms of functionality, they are identical.  Within the 4x5 meter room it catches everywhere without any delay.  There was never a break in the signal.  My PC is quite old, this summer will be 6 years old - it sees everything in the BIOS without dancing with a tambourine or other shamanic tricks.  Also, there were no problems with ‚Äúpickups‚Äù from other devices: there is also a wireless mouse and a Wi-Fi router, <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cb4/2ec/8fb/cb42ec8fb5034617f613a30a24796814.jpg" width="500"><br><h6>  Battery compartment and switch under the palm rest </h6><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cc6/20b/b41/cc620bb41c8452bd9d6fc9b15072b252.jpg" width="500"><br><br><h4>  About water resistance </h4><br>  There is no on the official website, but in some reviews I found that such protection exists - through holes under the keys (clearly seen if you look at the lamp through it) - such as in A4Tech keyboards with protection against spilling tea).  Did not check. <br><br><h4>  About legs </h4><br>  By itself, the keyboard is quite high, but it is possible to use 2 types of legs of different heights, which increase the rise by 4 and 8 degrees, respectively.  Personally, I found myself comfortable with big legs. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f46/727/ef9/f46727ef9eaa3b2b9e609374fa1e4d20.jpg" width="350"><br><h6>  Folded legs </h6><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/82a/789/5ab/82a7895ab507844b29091bb52c2f4263.jpg" width="350"><br><h6>  Big leg </h6><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/15e/362/7b6/15e3627b6ce0659ff20023a41433b4ff.jpg" width="350"><br><br><h6>  Little foot </h6><br><h4>  About quality </h4><br>  Plastic is pleasant to the touch, there is no backlash, nothing cracks or beeps.  For such money, this is not surprising, and the company is far from the last.  Inscriptions are not erased.  Sometimes I wipe with alcohol - everything is as new. <br><br><h4>  P.S. </h4><br>  As soon as I can, I will transfer it to the Iron hub. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/217009/">https://habr.com/ru/post/217009/</a></p>
