Want to talk about it? <br><br> <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/intel/blog/136443/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0f1/9b2/2a4/0f19b22a427e725823a768c377479c97.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In this issue there really is a snag that needs to be addressed.  It all started with the fact that I found myself a new interesting job - in order to focus on it, I had to start with all the initiatives ‚Äúon the side‚Äù.  Approximately as a permanent author lost not only the company Intel, but also ASUS.  And if the second people still somehow have something written there, then I still don‚Äôt have peace in my Intel blog, I really want everything to be fine with them.  With varying success, the author was searched for about six months, but apparently, so far nothing good has come of it :)

      Honestly, the Intel case on Habr√© is one of the most interesting and unusual.  During the entire stay, more than 200 posts of various formats were written: polls, announcements of new products and products, tablet reviews and bloody crash tests of notebooks, technical stories and funny videos, lectures and seminars, interactive chat rooms with employees and video tours, beauty contests and football matches, robot races and even five-week quizzes.  Maybe it seems to me, of course, it seems so (if only because I spent the best years of my life and incredible reserves of karma on it), but in general I don‚Äôt know any more such blogs on the site.  Stable third place in the ranking of companies on the site - I really do not want to, on this solemn note, the technological giant just took it and ‚Äústalled‚Äù.  On the leading IT-community something. <br><br>  A couple of photos from the demob album: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bfc/2dc/71b/bfc2dc71bc3417785c1ed6a0d4ca209f.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/539/a35/d3f/539a35d3f6ca2dc30e88adcf140dc81f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d0c/1ed/ceb/d0c1edceb40b585a65ef5f2a410d1fe5.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9ae/b01/29e/9aeb0129e80067f37a3994e59be673f3.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b57/899/b49/b57899b4991cbe058d026da3dcaf8a98.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/234/ffa/539/234ffa5399c72c4c71264689ad1c5fd5.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bbd/a4e/d81/bbda4ed81db251bd6e145bf76ef4f1ca.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ee1/848/532/ee184853257eb33ea5fa0dc7634155f0.jpg"><br><br>  We are looking for kind, caring and responsible IT-hands that can bring the pulse of a corporate blog in order.  Which immediately after receipt of the necessary information will be able to intelligibly present it to everyone else.  Which after the text of the text will be another 20 minutes to press the button ‚Äúpreview‚Äù, licking the appearance of the post.  Who will be optimistic in the comments with other members of the community and help them in something to figure out if necessary.  There is no need for advertising, all that is needed is to write interestingly and with soul. <br><br>  In general, the comment field in this post is a chance for those who want to work with one of the most famous companies in the world.  The work is not dusty, and there is no need to throw the current one - you can start small and, so to speak, in ‚Äúsafe mode‚Äù.  And then, who knows how it will turn out - you see, and they will take to the state.  I do not know what working conditions are waiting for a successful candidate, but I know for sure that there will be a pleasant team and interesting work, new glands for tests, periodic events with drunken festivals and forays somewhere in the world.  If, while reading posts on this blog, you at least once caught yourself thinking ‚Äú <i>Damn, and Burum's cool work, I wish I had this!</i>  ‚Äù- feel free to write in the comments why you want to blog at Intel. <br><br>  <s>After zeroing out negative karma,</s> tell us about your frantic interest in technology and the vast knowledge in this area;  Insert a photo where you solder the processor to a detached leg, provide links with examples of your interesting articles - in general, let's have something to make it clear that you are the one who needs it.  A big plus will be living in Moscow or the near Moscow region (personal contact will give more prospects), competent oral and written speech, as well as good knowledge of English. <br><br>  Good hands, pull up! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/136443/">https://habr.com/ru/post/136443/</a></p>
