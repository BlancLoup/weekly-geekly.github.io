A few rough examples: downloadable software, multimedia files and documents, multimedia streams, online games, as well as database queries, etc. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Many of the most popular sites on the Internet are <i>CDN</i> dependent.  One of the simplest examples is Google.  They have a network of data centers that can return the results of your search queries in a split second.  They would not be able to meet the needs of everyone around the world if it were not for their interconnected data centers that are able to distribute requests to their services. <br><br>  There is hardly any Internet user who has never used P2P services before.  P2P networks are a typical representative of content delivery networks.  In most cases, they are much cheaper to operate and mainly depend on user input and content demand.  The strength of P2P is that the more users download content, the more efficient the P2P network itself becomes, using the bandwidth for each client.

    <h5>  DNS testing </h5><br>  Sometimes some little things can create problems for your online business.  Every time someone visits your site, it goes through the Domain Name Server, which is part of the Domain Name System.  Domain Name System allows you to intelligently assign domain names to users and groups of Internet resources, regardless of the physical location of each subject.  Domain names are easier to remember than IPv4 and, in particular, IPv6 addresses.  It is precisely at this stage that the CDN plays an important role, namely, obtaining IP for a host from different points of the world. <br><br>  We offer several <a href="http://www.websitepulse.com/help/tools.php%3Ftab%3Ddns">DNS Tools</a> to help you with some important questions: <br><br>  <b>What is the IP behind this domain name?</b> <br><ul><li>  With the help of our HostName-test, you immediately get the IP behind the domain.  It is also a great way to make sure that the DNS records are correct and that the specified domain is sent to the correct IP. </li></ul><br>  <b>Where did this letter come from?</b> <br><ul><li>  Our <i>MX Lookup-</i> test returns a list of servers responsible for delivering email to this address, and their priority in relation to each other.  So you can see where a letter came from. </li></ul><br>  <b>Who is responsible for this domain name?</b> <br><ul><li>  If you are interested in knowing who owns the domain, you should use <i>Whois</i> .  However, you can also use the <i>NS records lookup</i> test.  It returns the NS records of the domain name management, in order to determine the domain.  This is a great tool for checking DNS records when transferring a domain from one registrar to another.  In addition, if you buy a domain, it is useful to double check the server name as soon as you set it up. </li></ul><br>  <b>What is the host behind this IP?</b> <br><ul><li>  <i>Reverse DNS</i> test is the complete opposite of <i>HostName</i> test.  You enter any IP and get the host associated with it. </li></ul><br>  <b>How can I trust this IP address?</b> <br><ul><li>  From time to time you will encounter sites that you cannot trust.  You can use the <i>HostName</i> test to check the website‚Äôs IP.  Then, you can copy the IP and paste it into our <i>Blacklist</i> test.  We request basic blacklists ‚Äî Sorbs, Spamhaus, NJABL, DSBL, CBL, and PSBL for the specified IP addresses and tell you if they are on spam mailing lists or other possible malicious acts. </li></ul><br><br>  These tools will help you troubleshoot common problems and identify problems where you rarely expect them.  Even if your server works fine and your sites are written beautifully, this does not mean that such a thing as a simple crash of your DNS server cannot happen.  Currently, we suggest you try our tools and let us know what you think about them.  We hope you find them useful! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/138177/">https://habr.com/ru/post/138177/</a></p>
