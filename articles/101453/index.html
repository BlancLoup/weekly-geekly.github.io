  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The main drawback of the Russian education system is misunderstanding of the purpose</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  This post was born when I realized that the commentary on the <a href="https://megamozg.ru/users/newuser/" class="user_link">newuser</a> " <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/edu_2_0/101444/">Main disadvantages of the Russian education system</a> " was too great. <br><br>  I graduated from a technical lyceum 4 years ago in a province far from the Moscow Ring Road.  Training at the Lyceum takes place from the 7th to the 11th grade  The load there was significantly more than in a regular school.  All sorts of checks were carried out for allegedly excessive workload, but I think this is nonsense because only those who wanted to study came there.  They go there on exams, so that not everyone will pass.  I am very pleased with this education, and to the question ‚Äúwhy?‚Äù I answer this post. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  What was there </h5><br>  <b>1. Normal provision with</b> everything you need, namely, skis of any size at a ski base, you don‚Äôt have to carry your own textbooks like in a regular school, all textbooks in the library, with very few exceptions, in the necessary classrooms video-reproducing equipment.  Chemicals in the office of chemistry and a bunch of physical equipment in the office of physics. <br><br>  <b>2. Educational process.</b>  We studied in pairs, almost the same as in a university, but it seems that the couple consists of two lessons of forty minutes each with a break of 5 minutes in the middle.  In my opinion this is the best option.  On the day of 3-4, occasionally 5 pairs.  Greatly simplifies the preparation of g / s, because  For 4 pairs, 4 subjects should be made, not 8 as in a regular school, and the textbook should be carried accordingly.  Plus, between the third and fourth pair is a normal lunch break, 40 minutes, it is enough to have a normal dinner in the dining room on the first floor.  Memories from school where dinner was 15-20 minutes and poured boiling tea into glasses in me are still alive.  We studied, by the way, 6 days a week.

      <b>3. Sharply increased load</b> on algebra and analysis, geometry, physics, English, computer science, drawing.  Works, music, drawing are completely excluded from the program.  The rest of the subjects corresponded to the school curriculum but were well taught, with the exception of a couple of subjects. <br><br><h5>  What was in class </h5><br>  <b>1. Informatics.</b>  For the first six months, we were introduced to what Windows is, given the concept of a window, folder, file, taught to move, copy, clarified that there is a shortcut and what is a file, etc.  Only the first half of the year, then we have not seen computers in the computer science lessons for a year and a half.  We studied the number system, Boolean algebra and other necessary things.  Virtually the entire university course of discrete mathematics, except for coding and encryption.  Then programming in Pascal, then HTML, SQL, database design.  All this greatly develops the brain.  Yes, I apply all this in practice now, although many do not apply, but they have learned not to be afraid of the unknown.  I think this is an ideal computer science curriculum. <br><br>  <b>2. Mathematics.</b>  I will not enumerate all that was, I will just say that we honestly tried in the epsilon-delta language to give definitions of limits, derivative, integral.  On geometry, we were able to count volumes through a vector product; accordingly, we knew how to take the determinant of a third order matrix.  Helped on the exam. <br><br>  <b>3. Physics.</b>  Bow Valery Anatolyevich.  Textbooks in the trash, studied according to their abstracts.  For each pair he brought us notes with a specific topic, and we studied them instead of a textbook.  And not only Ohm's laws, but even the device of the Synchrophasotron was there.  Well, and masterpiece experiments, the benefit of the equipment allowed. <br><br>  <b>4. Drawing</b> , on sheets A3, cuts, isometrics of difficult (for the student) intersections, for example, a hexagonal pyramid intersects with an octahedral prism. <br><br>  <b>5. English was</b> studied partly by English Grammar in Use, Raymond Murphy, blue, in a large format paperback, who saw that will remember.  By the way, the textbook is all in English on its own, even reading assignments and rules gave the practice of English. <br><br><h5>  What was missing </h5><br>  Russian and Literature, Chemistry.  And here and there we got to not very responsible teachers who did not particularly understand what was needed and what was not.  As a result, constant conflicts with teachers of the whole class, disgusting knowledge of the subject, terrible discipline.  And then I remember the formulas of basic acids, I remember some valencies, I naturally distinguish alkalis and salts, I often use knowledge of chemistry at home. <br><br><h5>  Now conclusions </h5><br>  As already mentioned <a href="https://megamozg.ru/users/newuser/" class="user_link">newuser</a> we forget what is not needed.  But communicating with the unnecessary, we learn to learn, learn to find the necessary information, learn not to be afraid of the unknown, pump up our brain muscle.  As a weightlifter barbell in the hall.  From this he does not learn to raise the sofa to the eighth floor, and he lowers the bar, no seemingly useful work, but this seemingly useless work is directed inward, towards the development of the body.  Similarly, the study of the processes of polymerization of ethylene develops your brain, brings up your spirit. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/101453/">https://habr.com/ru/post/101453/</a></p>
