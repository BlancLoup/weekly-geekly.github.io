  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Domains: Internet history</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  At the very beginning of the existence of the Internet, information about all, then still very few, computers connected to the Network was stored in files etc / hosts.  These text files were used (and are still used) in translating domain names into the network addresses of nodes.  However, literally in two years, there were more than a thousand hosts, and traffic problems began.  With the development of the Internet infrastructure, a system was needed that would streamline the constantly growing information.  This is how domains of different levels of hierarchy arose.  Gradually, a fan was added to the naming process - they began to put different meanings into the names of the websites and add different meanings to the top-level domains, invent interesting options and combinations.  Domains have become a special world.  <a href="https://www.reg.ru/">REG.RU</a> , as a registrar, is part of this world.  And we have something to tell. <br><br> <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/regru/blog/282962/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0a1/3ba/ad6/0a13baad6970425e95a736e57203f625.jpg"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Strictly speaking, it‚Äôs wrong to call a domain name.  This is slang.  A website address on the Internet is a fully qualified domain name (or more precisely, a FQDN, fully qualified domain name), including: <br><br><ul><li>  the second, third, fourth, etc. level domain name is the name allocated to the resource owner, excluding the first (top) level domain (.COM, .RU, etc.) and the zero (root) level domain (.) ;

    </li><li>  domain zone (top or first level domain) - designation of belonging to a geographical (.RU, .EU, .KZ) or thematic zone (.EDU, .GOV, .AERO, .ORG, .COM, .BIZ, .NET) . <br></li></ul><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e1d/2f7/778/e1d2f7778acb87de4ea2a789d281410d.png"></div><br>  The entire set of domains of different levels and makes up the full domain name - the unique address of the site on the web.  These unique addresses are recognized and interpreted by the DNS (Domain Name System) system for obtaining information about domains.  In fact, the beauty of your DNS site name is completely indifferent; it needs <s>your clothes, shoes, and motorcycle</s> IP address information to connect to the site.  And domain names are designed primarily for easy memorization and identification of the site address.  They take part in shaping the image of the company in the same way as the trademark, name, packaging design and so on.  This is the starting point of visibility on the Web, without which almost any business is hard to survive. <br><br>  Domain names are needed by anyone who wants to broadcast information about their own company / business / project on the Internet, which means that sooner or later they will have to come up with a name and register it.  By the way, if you have such a need, on <a href="https://www.reg.ru/">REG.RU</a> you will find many interesting tools for selecting a name in any domain zone.  Moreover, with us now when registering a domain, you can get 2 months of hosting for free and an SSL certificate for a year <a href="https://www.reg.ru/company/promotions/672">as a gift</a> .  The commercial break is over, we continue. <br><br>  As has repeatedly shown the experience of mankind, everything that has value in terms of impact on memory / psyche / consciousness of a potential consumer, sooner or later becomes the object of war, disputes, frauds, large and not-so-great deals.  As a result, a valuable object is overgrown with myths, legends and beautiful stories.  Domains (away from excessive technological snobbery, we will call them that) are no exception. <br><br><h2>  Living Legends: .com and .org </h2><br>  One of the first top-level domains of the hierarchy is <b>.COM</b> , which has existed since January 1985.  At first, it was managed by the US Department of Defense, but the domain was soon transferred to SRI International.  Initially, the .COM zone was created for the establishment of addresses of commercial companies.  The first domain in this zone was the address symbolics.com (appeared March 15, 1985).  Now .COM does not impose any obligations on the owner - the site can be of any orientation, and this top-level domain is still the most popular international domain. <br><br>  During its existence, he managed to become the talk of the town because of the so-called dot-com crisis.  In world economic practice, it is common to call any business based on the Internet (Internet companies) a dotcom.  At the very end of the 90s, dot-com went on an IPO, their market value grew every day.  Analysts had expected the NASDAQ index to reach 6000 points thanks to shares of high-tech companies.  The dotcom bubble burst quickly enough: gaining strength and increasing the value of shares in about 6 years, numerous Internet companies collapsed and initiated a bankruptcy procedure due to an ineffective business model.  The reason lay in the huge amounts of attracted loans spent on advertising and searching for new investors, and not on product development.  In March 2000, the NASDAQ collapsed, and then in 2002, found the mark of 1,100 points.  IT companies went bankrupt and liquidated one after another, even shares of giants like Sun and Cisco lost 60-80% in price.  That was the first drop in dotcoms.  Of course, the domain .COM itself has nothing to do with it, but his name has forever entered the history of the economy. <br><br>  Today, there are 125,620,040 domains in the .COM zone.  Incidentally, corporations have used the .COR domain name before the dotcoms. <br><br>  <b>Some notable stories about the .COM zone</b> <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="http://www.milliondollarhomepage.com/">http://www.milliondollarhomepage.com/</a> - domain with a beautiful history.  This site was coined by 21-year-old Alex Tew, who did not have enough money to get a higher education.  On August 26, 2005, he began selling off each pixel for $ 1 (minimum order of 10x10 pixels).  Buyers acquired a place and placed images and links on this site with a peculiar viral effect.  The last pixel was sold on eBay for $ 38,100. The site‚Äôs home page is still alive and clickable (and there is even an advertisement for The Times). <br><br></li><li>  <a href="http://www.llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwyll-llantysiliogogogoch.com/">http://www.llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwyll-llantysiliogogogoch.com</a> - the longest name in the .COM area belongs to one Welsh village.  Now the site is not related to it and is a parked domain for referral earnings. <br><br></li><li>  According to VeriSign, the most popular words used in domain names of the .COM zone are ‚Äúhome‚Äù (1.2 million), ‚Äúonline‚Äù (1 million) and ‚Äúland‚Äù (891 thousand). <br><br></li><li>  Domain business.com was <a href="http://lenta.ru/news/2007/07/26/sold/">sold</a> for between 340 and 360 million US dollars, which is roughly equal to the annual budget of the Maldives or Sierra Leone. <br><br></li><li>  On September 28, 2015, the ex-Google employee Sanmai Ved used the Google Domains service and discovered that the Google.com address is free.  Vedas bought it for $ 12.  The story from the mouth of the Sunmai can be read in his <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/i-purchased-domain-googlecom-via-google-domains-sanmay-ved">Linkedin</a> .  For those who are lazy, the end is this: Sanmai reported the incident to Google security, an internal investigation has begun.  The corporation offered a reward, but Sanmai refused and asked to transfer the amount to the Art of Living India foundation, which provides free comprehensive education to children from Indian slums.  Google doubled the amount and transferred it to the fund, in the interests of the company, details of the results of the investigation and the size of the remuneration were not disclosed. <br><br></li><li>  In 2015, the most expensive domain was the domain Porno.com, purchased back in February last year for 8,888,888 US dollars.  The second and third place was shared by the domains PX.com and 588.com - $ 1 million each. <br></li></ul><br>  <b>By the way, about the most expensive (not rating, just some names on the ear):</b> <br><br><ul><li>  sex.com - $ 13 million (2010), <br></li><li>  Fund.com - $ 9,999,950 (2008), <br></li><li>  Porn.com - $ 9,500,000 (2007), <br></li><li>  Bingo.com - $ 8,000,000 (2014) <br></li><li>  Diamond.com - $ 7,500,000 (2006), <br></li><li>  Toys.com - $ 5,100,000 (2009), <br></li><li>  Vodka.com - $ 3,000,000 (2006), <br></li><li>  Computer.com - $ 2 100 000 (2007), <br></li><li>  Russia.com - $ 1 500 000 (2009), <br></li><li>  eBet.com - $ 1,350,000 (2013), <br></li><li>  MM.com - $ 1,200,000 (2014). <br></li></ul><br>  There are a lot of such examples.  It is noteworthy that some of these crazy transactions are associated with the name of the person who received the informal status of the king of domains.  This is the president and co-founder of the first domain conference TRAFFIC Rick Schwartz (Rick Schwartz).  He purchased his first domain name LipService.com in December 1995, paying $ 100.  Agree, a serious investment.  However, a few years later, Rick went on millions of transactions.  For example, he sold the domain Men.com for $ 1.32 million.  Schwartz was the first to realize the value of direct traffic when users do not search for a website through a search engine, but drive in a remembered domain name into a browser line (do you feel the power of investing in a good domain name?).  Well, then it went, went: <br><br><ul><li>  Schwartz registered the domain name eBet.com in 1996 for $ 100, and almost 20 years later he sold it to Network Solutions for $ 1.35 million. <br><br></li><li>  He sold the domain name candy.com for $ 3 million to the confectionery company G &amp; J Holdings. <br><br></li><li>  He registered porno.com in 1997 for $ 42,000. After that, he earned more than $ 10 million from advertising and redirects.  Well, in February 2015, as mentioned above, he sold the domain for $ 8,888,888. <br></li></ul><br>  Domain .COM has become an integral part of international business, the names in this zone - the object of the most expensive transactions in the history of domain names.  Around dot-com focused cybersquatters, hackers and lovers of profit from around the world. <br><br>  <b>Domain .org</b> <br><br>  The situation is slightly different with the top-level domain .ORG.  It appeared in 1985, together with .COM, and has existed for 30 years.  Domain .ORG created for non-profit organizations, charitable foundations, volunteers, cultural and scientific projects.  For example, on January 13, 2001, Wikipedia (wikipedia.org) started working there.  In domain .org as of 04/04/2016, there are 10 911 485 domain names.  This is the third leader after the top-level domain .NET (15,653,571 domain names). <br>  You can talk about the .ORG domain for a very long time, as well as about its ‚Äúresidents‚Äù.  But it is better not to rush to read and see the <a href="http://happy30th.org/">anniversary timeline infographic</a> - this is really very interesting.  Steeper and not tell. <br><br><h2>  National </h2><br>  Probably, on ‚ÄúHabr√©‚Äù there is not a single person who has not heard about the domain zone. RF, in which <a href="http://statonline.ru/%3Ftld%3Drf">there are</a> 878,144 domains.  Meanwhile, this is not the only ‚Äúnational faction‚Äù of domain names in its native language.  ICANN is positioning the creation of domain names in national languages ‚Äã‚Äãis perhaps the main task of creating a truly global Internet.  Therefore, the organization takes all measures to ensure the full functioning of both site names and e-mail linked to such domains.  At the moment, the case has progressed the most for the Arab segment, but there are domains for Spanish, German, Japanese, Chinese, and other characters. <div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/461/a5e/9c4/461a5e9c4d6029abd13f921acc0fedf4.png"></div><br><br>  In addition, domains with an outline in the national language appear already among the new top-level domains of new gTLDs (generic Top-Level Domain).  For example, in the Chinese.. (.URL) - 338 008 domains, the Chinese. ÂïÜÂüé (‚Äúshopping center‚Äù) - 12 782 domains, etc. <br><br>  <b>But how does the DNS understand them?</b> <br><br>  It's simple: multilingual domains are transferred to the DNS system in a transformed form.  On the client side, conversion from UNICODE to ASCII Compatible Code (ACE - ASCII Compatible Encoding) takes place - strings consisting of UNICODE characters are represented using Latin lowercase letters and numbers.  That is, just in the form of those characters that DNS easily perceives and later returns the client's IP address. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7e6/280/ba7/7e6280ba7ba38e97110a737f354e974c.png"></a> <br><br>  This conversion is necessary because not all DNS servers support the processing of domain names in the IDN format.  The method of converting sequences of Unicode characters into ACE sequences is called the Punycode algorithm (Punymod for . - xn - p1ai). <br><br>  <b>Short Facts About National Domains</b> <br><br><ul><li>  Zona.RF - the world's first Cyrillic domain zone. <br><br></li><li>  The first domain names in the zone. RF became President.RF and Government.RF. <br><br></li><li>  Prior to the creation of top-level domains in national languages, non-Latin alphabets were used only in writing domains of the second and lower levels. <br><br></li><li>  The first were the Spanish-speaking countries that rebelled - Chile introduced domain names with the letter √± (which it became possible to use as early as the end of 2001) and other accents. <br><br></li><li>  In the European Union countries, permission to use diacritical marks (of which in abundance, for example, in German and French) did not lead to a rapid growth in the registration of such domains, in contrast to the countries with the Cyrillic alphabet, in particular, Russia.  Someone explains this by the reluctance to separate the audience (yet a single European Union = a single consumer), someone by the lack of desire for ethnic identity (which is hardly fair and, rather, far-fetched, for example, for the French who are literally mad about their love for their language ).  But everything can be even simpler: using the Latin alphabet allows you to replace the sound tied to the diacritics with an alphabetic combination and get a correctly sounding domain without accents and subscripts. <br><br></li><li>  On the <a href="https://www.reg.ru/domain/new/%25D0%25A0%25D0%25A3%25D0%25A1/">REG.RU</a> website, it is already possible to register a domain name in the <a href="https://www.reg.ru/domain/new/%25D0%25A0%25D0%25A3%25D0%25A1/">.RUS</a> zone, if you have domains in .RF or .RU domains.  Hurry up - from May 24th it will be available to everyone and then for some names you will have to <s>fight for a</s> bargain.  We also have metropolitan domains <a href="https://www.reg.ru/domain/new/%25CC%25CE%25D1%25CA%25C2%25C0/">.MOSCOW</a> and <a href="https://www.reg.ru/domain/new/%25CC%25CE%25D1%25CA%25C2%25C0/">.MOSCOW</a> and New gTLD.ONLINE, .THE, and. SITE. <br><br></li><li>  Malaysian national top level domain .MY is the fastest growing among Asian representatives.  Introduced in 1987.  Until March 27, 2008 in the Malaysian domain .MY it was possible to register only names of the third level in seven second-level domains: COM.MY, NET.MY, ORG.MY, GOV.MY, EDU.MY, MIL.MY and NAME.MY .  Today <a href="https://www.reg.ru/domain/new/MY/">you can register</a> any names available.  We do not urge you to try your luck, like Rick Schwartz, but such a domain doesn‚Äôt interfere with international business, Asian markets are in a trend today. <br><br></li><li>  Another noteworthy national domain is .SU (119,060 domain names), the top-level domain for the USSR (Soviet Union).  It was registered on September 19, 1990 on behalf of the UNIX User Association (Soviet UNIX User's Group) (at the Kurchatov Institute).  After a number of vicissitudes and formal conservation, he survived, domain name registration is available. <br><br></li><li>  The top-level domain .RU appeared in two songs: <a href="https://music.yandex.ru/search%3Ftext%3D%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D1%2583%25D1%2588%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%2520international%2520-%2520%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B7%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B0%2520%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D1%2587%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%2520%25D1%2580%25D1%2583">Beznadega.ru</a> and the legendary <a href="https://music.yandex.ru/search%3Ftext%3Dwww%2520%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B3%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B4">WWW.Leningrad</a> (spb.ru). <br></li></ul><br>  A national domain is a necessary attribute of a business that wants to grow in each of the regions.  The familiar letters at the end of the domain name are subconsciously associated by the user with the home country, easier to remember, their credibility is higher.  This means that loyalty to the company owning the site is growing. <br><br><h2>  Unusual names and new domains </h2><br>  Obviously, during the existence of the Internet, millions of domains have been registered in existing zones.  The chances of getting the right and / or sonorous name became less and less.  The world could not do without them, and they appeared - new gTLDs, new domains with meaningful, commercial and even playful names.  The <a href="https://ntldstats.com/tld">New gTLD</a> list includes about 1,000 top-level domain zones.  In total, over 15 million addresses are registered in them, among which the names in the zones .XYZ, .TOP, .WANG, .WIN are leading (this is for the winners in life, not what you thought), .CLUB.  You may come across unexpected or, on the contrary, very expected names: .ONLINE, .XXX, .PARTY, .RED, .SPACE, .LOL, .SEX, .OOO, .COFFEE, and others. Here live geodomains: .MOSCOW, .BERLIN .LONDON.  In these zones, thousands of domain names are registered annually, and they all serve the business well. <br><br>  Here are some more examples from the list of new domain zones in which you can find unusual and appealing names: <br><br><ul><li>  .WTF ‚Äî perturbed-inquiring domain <br></li><li>  .KOSHER is for its own <br></li><li>  .NINJA - for real ninjas. <br></li></ul><br>  Finally, there are several interesting complete domain names (website addresses) that will clearly delight readers: <br><br><ul><li>  ‚ÄúHabr‚Äù will appreciate <a href="http://3.141592653589793238462643383279502884197169399375105820974944592.eu/">http://3.141592653589793238462643383279502884197169399375105820974944592.eu/</a> - and this is not just fun, but a site entirely dedicated to the number ‚Äúpi‚Äù, including cufflinks in the shape of this symbol. <br><br></li><li>  <a href="http://urka.ru/">http://urka.ru/</a> - well, this bar of lawyers from the Urals obviously conceived everything, we do not believe in coincidences.  Interesting, the site is ready for habraeffektu? <br><br></li><li>  <a href="http://dowebsitesneedtolookexactlythesameineverybrowser.com/">dowebsitesneedtolookexactlythesameineverybrowser.com</a> - found the answer to the basic question of web development. <br></li></ul><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9d7/ccd/0a4/9d7ccd0a4335cabaf0b22429d63a67bd.gif"></div><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Here it is, a real six-level domain</font></i> <br><br>  In principle, we did not publish vulgar and ambiguous domain names, which everyone has known about for a long time.  By the way, the fact of the existence of numerous posts and articles on this topic speaks only about one thing: the name of the site today is just as important as the logo, slogan and company name.  The name can cause hatred, love, virality, ridicule, which one to choose depends on the commercial goal of the company or private owner.  You can improve yourself as you please, remember one thing: whatever you call your site, so it starts. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/282962/">https://habr.com/ru/post/282962/</a></p>
