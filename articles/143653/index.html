      So, QuickBlox is a set of modules and blocks with pre-set logic.  A mobile application programmer can concentrate on developing the application itself, rather than take care of hosting for the backend.  The most necessary tasks of authorizing a user, storing his data and files, pictures and avatars, game ratings and much more will no longer require the implementation of the server application. <br><br>  The <b>QuickBlox</b> infrastructure <b>is</b> completely located on <u>Amazon Web Services</u> .  On Habr√©, I have some pretty good <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/korjik/topics/">articles</a> about these services, but the main thing is that we have huge and <s>almost</s> unlimited resources for scaling. <br><br>  The following project modules are available for REST API: <br><ul><li>  Users </li><li>  Ratings </li><li>  Content </li><li>  Chat </li><li>  Messages </li><li>  Location </li></ul><br>  More about all the modules will be discussed in separate articles, there will also be given pieces of code for the most common platforms, examples of API calls and other usefulness.  In this article I will go through the modules briefly. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  Users </h5><br>  The <b>Users</b> module allows you to store and authenticate users in the application.  Such fields as login, facebook id, twitter id, email, phone, website, fullname, external id are available for storage.  Also available are tags that allow users to be divided into groups. <br><br>  We can store hundreds of thousands of your users, and you will not even care about server capacity and data storage. <br><br><h5>  Ratings </h5><br>  The name of the module <b>Ratings</b> speaks for itself - in this module you can store all sorts of records of ratings and highkors.  There is a flexible system of settings for gamemodes and parameters with which the application works.  <b>Ratings</b> logic has been developed on the demand of many developers who work with us and covers almost all options for recording high-rate games. <br><br><h5>  Content </h5><br>  Amazon S3-based storage is available through the <b>QuickBlox</b> API.  Configuring access rights, the ability to download huge files, an infinite volume (declared by AWS) give the developer of a mobile application a head start over the rest of the market players.  Everything has been invented and thought out for you a long time ago - using the API, store files with us!  By the way, streaming is also supported, and several applications for very famous studios are developed on the basis of the <b>Content</b> module. <br><br><h5>  Chat </h5><br>  All XMPP chat features connected to the <b>Users</b> module and multiplied by the thousands of connections raised at the same time will give your application the desired socialization.  With the usual p2p chat rooms are also available in the multi user chat.  File transfer, video and audio calls are possible thanks to all the same XMPP. <br><br><h5>  Messages </h5><br>  The <b>messaging</b> module supports the main platforms for push notifications - <i>iOS</i> , <i>Android</i> and <i>Windows Phone</i> .  Currently pushing for <i>BlackBerry</i> is under development - they will be available in the near future. <br><br>  In addition to pushu, messages are also available via email (via Amazon SES), pull notifications and POST requests to third-party services.  Mutual integration with the Users module allows you to send messages to users and groups of users at the same time, for example, using tags. <br><br><h5>  Location </h5><br>  The <b>Location</b> module can store user coordinates and create geodates from these coordinates with status ‚Äî places where the user was (something similar in logic to Forsquare), and if you link a picture from the Content module to them, it will already look like Instagram ‚Äî a place with a picture and a comment on the map. <br><br>  To facilitate the development and accelerate the integration of applications with QuickBlox, our programmers <a href="http://quickblox.com/developers/QuickBlox_Developers">developed an SDK</a> for the main platforms - iOS, Android, Windows Phone and Web / Facebook.  The SDK is almost completely covered with user cases and API calls. <br><br>  QuickBlox is also famous for its open source projects - <a href="http://quickblox.com/developers/Category:Samples">Samples</a> .  These programs provide an opportunity to view the code and, modifying it to suit your needs, embed it in your applications.  From the smallest SimpleSamples that describe elementary actions with QuickBlox, to huge applications with augmented reality - everything is available in the open code of our <a href="https://github.com/QuickBlox">GitHub</a> account. <br><br>  And now some details about the service.  <b>QuickBlox is</b> written on Ruby on Rails.  As a DBMS, we use MySQL on AmazonRDS.  Chat module - Java application.  Our product uses almost 80% of Amazon‚Äôs services, and as we expand with them, we are always discovering new horizons. <br><br>  Well, as without the main thing, the price!  At the moment, <b>QuckBlox</b> for beta developers is absolutely free.  Resource consumption and traffic are considered, but not reflected in your account.  And also for beta developers, discount programs are provided in the future.  If you use <b>QuickBlox</b> for free now, then, having become paid, <b>QuickBlox</b> will not become for you an expensive pleasure.  This program was created specifically to attract developers, find and fix ALL bugs. <br><br>  New features?  We are open to discuss the new functionality at the request of our developers.  For discussion of features and questions we have a <a href="http://community.quickblox.com/quickblox">community</a> and <a href="https://support.quickblox.com/">support</a> . <br><br>  How are we better than competitors?  Firstly, we are guys from Kharkov, and this is the Runet - we will provide all the necessary support in your native language.  Again, we are free and open to the features that you want to see with us - this is the second and third.  The platform is in active development and at this stage your feedbacks are much more important than your dollars. <br><br>  However, this is all the short information about <b>QuickBlox</b> .  In more details modules and API will be described separately. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/143653/">https://habr.com/ru/post/143653/</a></p>
