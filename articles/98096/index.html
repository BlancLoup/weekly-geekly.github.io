Recently, more and more information appears that Google is going to create its own social network in order to compete with Facebook.  One of the first about this in his blog told <a href="http://kevinrose.com/">Kevin Rose</a> , founder of the social network Digg.com, with reference to the information of some reliable insider from Google.  Rumors about this instantly picked up by many news agencies of the world.  And, as you know, there is no smoke without fire. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="http://blackchristiannews.com/news/images/eric-schmidt20.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Some time from the search giant there were no comments.  But at his yesterday‚Äôs speech in London, Google‚Äôs chief executive Eric Schmidt did not publicly deny that the company was determined to compete with Facebook, which added fuel to the discussion that the company was about to launch Google Me this year.  As often happens in such situations, when it will be officially announced the launch of a new product, is not reported. <br><br>  However, reporters were informed that a lot of work had been done to create a competitive service after several unsuccessful attempts to launch a successful socially oriented product.  Google‚Äôs desire to create its own social network looks quite reasonable.  In the face of Facebook, there is an ‚Äúimpending‚Äù threat in the form of the opportunity to receive advertising revenue from more than a million sites connected to its platform. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0c1/8d5/09c/0c18d509cda8fd775c22720c73a761b4.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Over the past 2 years, Google has paid serious attention to social networks.  Earlier this year, a social-exchange network was launched based on existing email services called Google Buzz, but it is not able to compete with full-fledged social networks such as Twitter or Facebook.  Another earlier attempt by Google to enter this market is the Orkut social network, although it has more than 100 million registered users, but it is most prevalent in Central and South America.  For example, in Brazil, it is very popular because it has no competitors there.  It is quite possible that Google is simply tired of developing its previous, not very successful social resources, and is ready for a radical step - combining all of its achievements under the wing of Google Me.

Developments implemented in Buzz will not be enough and the company will have to build a full-fledged social network and attract many engineers to develop it.  Compared to previous attempts, this project has the highest priority, he said. <br><br>  But no matter what, Schmidt summed up that you can not compare Facebook and Google.  Search and social interaction are still quite different consumption information paradigms. <br><br>  <a href="http://social.venturebeat.com/2010/07/01/schmidt-google-me/">A source</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/98096/">https://habr.com/ru/post/98096/</a></p>
