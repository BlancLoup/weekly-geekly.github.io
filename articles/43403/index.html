  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to connect acquiring to online store?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  This is not a topic with a presentation of the material, but an appeal for advice to people who have experience in creating online stores. <br><br>  Half a year ago, we decided to open an online store.  I will not go into details, I‚Äôm afraid they‚Äôll find it for advertising and get right down to business.  Our research has shown that the bulk of the target audience prefers bank cards as a means of payment.  So, accepting payments from cards for our store is the main and most important thing, you need to connect it first.  This is where the problems started.  If I understand correctly, there are two ways to work with maps: <a name="habracut"></a>  Under the cut almost drama <br><ul><li>  Connection through a bank that provides the acquiring service </li><li>  Connection through an integrator company (Assist, Z-Payment, etc.), which allow using a single interface for many payment systems - WM, bank cards, etc. </li></ul><br>  Because  until this time we had no experience in connecting cards, it is possible that the list is not complete. <br>  Both of these methods have one big drawback - connecting a rather lengthy process.  And we have such a situation that time is very tight (the site is ready, people are ready to start work).  In the case of a bank, you need to collect and execute a lot of documents + the review process takes a week and more (addressed Raiffeisen).  In the second case, we stopped at Z-Payment.  Here, too, not everything is simple, they need to send them a multi-page contract by paper mail.  And since  we are in Yekaterinburg, and the recipient‚Äôs address is in Irkutsk, knowing the ‚Äúquickness‚Äù of our mail, I assume that the process can take a month, or even more, even if sent in a valuable letter. <br><br>  I understand that because  we have no experience, most likely we have stepped on a known rake and the question has a more optimal solution.  Therefore, I appeal to the community and people who have already dealt with a similar problem.  Who solved this question how: <b>How to connect accepting payments from bank cards to an online store as soon as possible?</b>

      Once again, it happens in Yekaterinburg, the store only works in Russia, all documents on the legal entity, etc.  decorated, form of education Ltd. <br><br>  UPD: the company's current account is located in Rus Bank.  And yes, I read a similar <a href="http://jazzbird.habrahabr.ru/blog/26033/">post</a> .  But I am interested in the question from the point of view of the duration of the connection and convenience for the client (store customers). <br><br>  UPD: Thank you all for your help, the problem is solved with a little blood.  The bottom line was 5 working days of work without the possibility of payment by cards, but thanks to the rest of the payment methods, this is not fatal, though painful.  After reviewing various methods, systems, etc., we decided to connect to Z-Payment - the consultant on their part promised that it would take about 5 days to do everything about everything.  The rest of this market has much longer terms (ChronoPay, CyberPlat), and / or connection conditions (Assist, UCS and others like them) are too hard for us and / or tariffs are too high (intermediary companies working through the same UCS and Assisst) . <br><br>  For those interested in the process of studying, I came across a curious review <a href="http://www.businesspress.ru/newspaper/article_mId_21961_aId_92964.html">‚ÄúOptions for accepting payments using plastic cards when making payments on the Internet‚Äù</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/43403/">https://habr.com/ru/post/43403/</a></p>
