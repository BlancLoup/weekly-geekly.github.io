Could this be a slide making skill and a beard trimmer?  - here we are prompted by a young man from the back of the desk.  Not.  Here is a frightened girl, hiding behind a pile of multi-colored certificates and diplomas, mentions many years of experience.  Not at all.  It turns out a tired and tortured middle-aged man and declares: "A calculator for calculating the total amount of profits brought to the customer?" So, but businessmen were not called here at all, this is our inner rowtree, leave the class.  Okay, I will not torment you, here it is - the main tool of any true expert working with user experience (yes, that's exactly what the UX sounds like in translation): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/311/e95/47d/311e9547d748c723f7ecc98b0c9fa815.jpg" alt="image"><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  So, today it is increasingly possible to meet the abbreviation ui \ ux, as if combining Yin and Yang in modern foundations of the design and design of information systems.  Actually, in reality, these two incarnations do not harmoniously complement each other, but they constantly come into fierce confrontation for the budget and the attention of the development team.  And if defeating bad UI can Sketch and Photoshop in large doses, then how to work with the psychology of the user on the other side of the monitor - not everyone understands yet.

      We take the real case as the basis of the article, when too much attention to the quality of visual interfaces against the background of the utter lack of UX skills only hurt one online store, despite the fact that the graphic itself of this site (let's call it 99, so that no one would guess) was close to perfection.  See for yourself how well the buttons are rounded here: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/545/4ab/b63/5454abb632f76abbd00c9ca7b1038efc.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  It is immediately obvious that the leaders of this service attend all without exception design symposia, usability conferences, TRIZ seminars, and all other meetings and meetings, at which they demonstrate the perfection of their visual interface of the site W99.  Indeed, it is easy to see that from a graphic point of view this delivery icon is really perfect, and even Jobs himself would not have painted better.  It is beautiful in everything, in every pixel, and a long meditation on this ‚Äúicon‚Äù really makes for some time to believe that the UX of this service will be just as fascinating and magical. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3a4/4ea/63c/3a44ea63c40256d36076fd7898210c57.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Not really.  The beauty of the icons ends precisely with the beauty of the icons, and the user experience says absolutely the opposite. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c8a/94e/efa/c8a94eefa721583daabd4d87681f9fa6.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d68/0a5/30c/d680a530c6382d7ea98974545713b64b.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/50f/a9a/6af/50fa9a6af4e8acb768f9cf386a7cdcfb.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Of course, we can say that all competitors make false reviews, adding them a dozen pieces every day.  However, my personal test confirmed the worst concerns: the order of March 4 was delivered only on the 14th at 10:40 pm (that is, almost at night).  Where is the 24 hours here?  Is cheating?  But what about the pixel-perfect ikonochka?  Doesn't everyone really care about real buyers and the store really earns only on a slide show at various conferences?  Not everything is so terrible, in fact, they simply do not have the main tool of any self-respecting user experience specialist.  Therefore, such a disharmony of a picture about 24 hours and expectations of 10 days, beautiful UI and real user experience, rounding buttons and impressions from living people is obtained.  Such is the conflict of promises and reality. <br><br>  How can a simple baseball bat help in constantly improving customer loyalty and increasing the company's overall image?  How to increase returns and reposts, the number of transitions and the weight of the order basket?  We take the UX tool I mentioned above, go down to the basement or to Mordor (I don‚Äôt know which place is better suited to accommodate the logistics department or delivery service) and start banging the staff with this very bat until the thought of that instead of tomorrow's flight to Copenhagen for the next design congress, it is already worth hiring another, that is, a second courier.  Yes, the laws of the Russian Federation allow to simultaneously contain two, and even (you will not believe) three couriers at the same time.  True, each of them will have to pay thousands of rubles 15 rubles each month, but it‚Äôs worth making such sacrifices, because they do not save usability. <br><br>  The bonus bits in front of all other usability enhancement tools is that it can also be directed at yourself.  That is, as soon as the thoughts in my head start jumping from the tasks of increasing customer satisfaction with delivery - to the next repainting of buttons on the site or drawing slides for the next stand-up show for representatives of the Ural cluster, one should immediately begin to bludgeon himself on the forehead.  Simple and convenient. <br><br>  At the beginning of the article I mentioned Yin and Yang for nothing, as two components of universal harmony.  Indeed, the world as a whole is extremely perfect and harmonious, and in each of its manifestations corresponds to Newton's Third Law: <i>Action always has an equal and opposite reaction, otherwise the interactions of two bodies against each other are equal and directed in opposite directions.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d60/d55/47e/d60d5547ee5b899fefbca3db823ea5ac.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  I translate this immutable law of the universe into a modern design language: <b>if it burns daily with your subordinates and they fly around the office from your kicks, then the end customer will always be happy and satisfied;</b>  <b>but if your employees are happy and satisfied, and lazily sitting on chairs, slurping smoothies after a game of tennis or billiards, then buyers will always burn</b> .  This is the eternal balance of forces in nature, which your personalized bit will help you to tune within your company. <br><br>  We summarize: in my personal conviction, the runet is overly bogged down in the design of the UI, having heard a lot of storytellers with beards and <s>cassocks</s> in hoody about the fact that any beautiful picture on the screen is in itself capable of ensuring the love and loyalty of customers.  No, friends, loyal customers who will want to return to you again and again, will give you not material-design and parallax on the website, but a baseball bat, with which you will bring up your subordinates from the department of logistics and marketing every morning, from the department of online payments and hiring lazy losers, restoring universal harmony and paying tribute to the genius of Newton.  Only daily beatings of all your employees are able to guarantee the growth of user likes and the desire to repeat the purchase experience on your site. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/279493/">https://habr.com/ru/post/279493/</a></p>
