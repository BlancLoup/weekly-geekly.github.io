Over the years, more than 500,000 copies have been published, and web developers are still enthusiastic about it. <br><br>  This book is both a programmer‚Äôs guide and a comprehensive reference book on basic JavaScript and client application interfaces provided by web browsers.

      The book is divided into four parts.  Part I covers the JavaScript language itself.  Part II covers client-side JavaScript: JavaScript application programming interfaces defined by the HTML5 standard and its associated standards and implemented in web browsers.  Part III of the book is an extensive reference for the basic JavaScript language, including descriptions of all classes, objects, constructors, methods, functions, properties and constants defined in JavaScript 1.8, V8 3.0 and ECMAScript 5. Part IV is a reference for client-side JavaScript.  It describes the web-browser application programming interfaces, the DOM API Level 3 standard and the recently included HTML5 WebSockets and WebWorkers technologies, localStorage and sessionStorage objects, as well as audio and video tags. <br><br><h5>  Stoyan Stefanov.  Javascript  Templates </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/46d/25f/050/46d25f050735da9319d00bf0316cf7db.jpg" alt="image"><br><h6>  annotation </h6><br>  Developers of server, client, or desktop JavaScript applications often encounter problems with objects, functions, inheritance, and other features of this language.  What are the best practices for developing JavaScript applications?  This book answers this question by offering a large number of different JavaScript programming patterns, such as ‚Äúsingle object‚Äù (singleton), ‚Äúfactory‚Äù (factory), ‚Äúdecorator‚Äù (decorator), and others.  We can say that they are not only methods for solving the most typical software development tasks, but also procurement solutions for entire categories of such tasks. <br>  The use of templates for programming in JavaScript has its own characteristics.  Some of them, developed from the standpoint of strongly typed languages, such as C ++ and Java, cannot be directly used in dynamic typing languages, such as JavaScript.  For such patterns in the JavaScript language there are simpler alternatives. <br>  Written by JavaScript expert Stoyan Stefanov, Yahoo!  and the creator of the performance optimization tool of the web pages YSlow 2.0, - the book includes practical advice on the implementation of each of the considered templates with examples of program code.  The author also cites anti-patterns ‚Äî programming techniques that should be avoided whenever possible. <br><br><h5>  Lutz M. Programming in Python, 4th edition, I and II volume </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/134/fe8/6b0/134fe86b0d873b34cd206e13b5da9516.jpg" alt="image"><br><h6>  annotation </h6><br>  Mark Lutz's monumental work ‚ÄúPython Programming‚Äù in 2 volumes is a tutorial on how to use the Python language to solve the most typical tasks in various applied fields.  It discusses the use of Python in system administration, for creating graphical interfaces and web applications, and explores programming techniques for network interactions, interactions with databases, text processing, creating interfaces for scripts, and in many other areas.  Despite the fact that throughout the book the Python language is used, nevertheless, the focus will be not on the basics of the language, but on methods of solving practical problems.  Along the way, the book aims to acquaint the reader with frequently used tools and libraries.  Thus, this book is a resource that allows the reader to gain a deeper understanding of the role of the Python language in programming practice. <br><br>  Additionally, the book examines the suitability of the Python language for the role of a software development tool, as opposed to just a ‚Äúscripting‚Äù tool.  Many of the examples presented in the book are selected in accordance with this goal - among them you will find examples of the gradual development of email clients, based on thousands of lines of program code.  Creating such large-scale applications will always be difficult, but we will show how much faster and easier such applications are created when they are developed in the Python language. <br><br>  The fourth edition includes a description of the new features of the language, libraries and programming techniques for Python 3.X.  In particular, the examples presented in the book are executed under the control of the interpreter of Python 3.1, the most recent version of Python at the time of this writing.  Immediately before the book was published, all the main examples were tested under the third alphabet of Python 3.2, but, generally speaking, they should keep their performance when using any version of Python from the 3.X line. <br><br><h5>  Jeffrey Forsier, Paul Bissex, Wesley Chan.  Django  Python Web Application Development </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7df/bcb/13e/7dfbcb13e52538b35b7e4fed30a60e82.jpg" alt="image"><br><h6>  annotation </h6><br>  With a simple and reliable Django platform based on Python, you can create powerful web solutions by writing just a few lines of code.  Its use allows for high speed and flexibility of development, as well as to solve a wide range of applied tasks.  Authors, experienced developers, describe all the tricks, tools and concepts you need to know in order to make the best use of Django 1.0, including all the main features of the new version. <br>  This comprehensive tutorial starts with an introduction to Python, then discusses the core components of Django (models, views, and patterns) and the order in which the interactions between them are organized.  Describes how to develop specific applications: a blog, a photo gallery, a content management system, a tool for publishing code snippets with syntax highlighting.  After that, more complex topics are considered: extending the template system, syndicating, setting up an administration application, and testing web applications. <br>  The authors reveal to the developer the secrets of Django, giving detailed explanations and providing a large number of examples of program code, accompanying them with line-by-line description and illustrations. <br>  UPD.  The year of publication of the book is 2009, so the version of Django in the book is very outdated, there may be problems with examples unadapted for modern realities. <br><br>  What books would you recommend? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/207542/">https://habr.com/ru/post/207542/</a></p>
