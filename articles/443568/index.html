Terry's story is a tragic tale of how a mental illness took away a person from us who declared himself "the greatest programmer ever to live." <br><br><h2>  The Early Years of Terry Davis </h2><br>  Terry Davis was born on December 15, 1969 in West Allis, pc.  Wisconsin.  But then during his life he moved to Oregon, Washington, Michigan and Arizona.  He was born in a large family, was the seventh child of eight, and his father was an industrial engineer who worked on the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A2%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD_(%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0-%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C)">Titan</a> rocket system in the 70s and 80s. <br><br>  He grew up in close contact with his brothers and sisters, but when mental problems began to manifest themselves in adulthood, he decided that: ‚ÄúJesus did not talk to his brothers and sisters, he did not want to have anything in common with them, he was better off with strangers .  And I am the same. " <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  As a child, Terry was sent to a school program for gifted children, and he had access to an Apple II computer, from which his love of computers began.  He quickly switched to Commodore 64, and there his talent manifested itself immediately when he mastered assembler in the early 80s.

      His result in the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAT">SAT</a> test was 1440 [ <i>something like the American version of the USE;</i>  <i>a score of 1440 falls in 3% of the most talented / approx.</i>  <i>trans.</i>  ], and he became a National Merit program finalist [ <i>search for gifted candidates for scholarships / approx.</i>  <i>trans.</i>  ].  He later boasted of writing a line drawing algorithm for the Commodore 64, which worked faster than the standard one. <br><br>  Davis continued to study in high school programming and eventually entered the University of Arizona, where he graduated from the Master of Science in Electrical Engineering in 1994. <br><br>  As a student, Terry worked at Ticketmaster, and programmed the OS from 1990 to 1994, and then he was transferred to the research department, where from 1994 to 1996 he participated in the creation of barcode scanners and power supplies. <br><br>  Terry left Ticketmaster when he decided that he wanted to work on satellite systems, and using his father‚Äôs contacts, he sent out resumes to a number of Defense Department contractors. <br><br>  Davis was raised a Catholic, but then he declared himself an atheist.  ‚ÄúI thought the brain was a computer,‚Äù he told the <a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/wnj43x/gods-lonely-programmer">Motherboard</a> .  He did not believe in the need for a soul, but in 1996 he re-found God, having experienced a revelation, and described in the email for the Motherboard his feelings, ‚Äúvery similar to mental illness.  I felt guilty for being such an atheist and champion of technology.  To put it mildly, I was frightened thinking about quantum computers.  Well, mental illness played a role. ‚Äù <br><br>  In 1996, Davis experienced regular and strong manic episodes.  He suffered from hallucinations related to aliens from space and government surveillance.  He talked about how he saw people in suits looking after him, but he was not sure whether he was being studied because of the vacancies for which he had sent a resume. <br><br>  Continuing to notice the surveillance of people in suits, he began to invent various conspiracy theories.  He was worried that the government might be interested in him after he developed computer control systems. <br><br>  As a result, Davis had a seizure, because of which he drove 150 km south, without any final goal.  He believed that he was being led by a radio in a car, which, as it seemed to him, commented on everything he did that day.  During his trip, various conspiracy theories began to emerge, he began to worry about large oil companies and their ‚Äúconcealment‚Äù of more efficient water-powered engines. <br><br>  Davis eventually stopped in the wilderness of Martha in Texas, and dismantled his car, trying to find a follow-up device, and then also threw his keys into the desert, fearing surveillance by the government. <br><br>  He was picked up by a police officer who saw a man walking alone along the road.  The police officer suggested that he take the passenger‚Äôs seat, but during the trip, Davis jumped out of the car on the move, breaking the collarbone.  He was taken to a local hospital, but then everything just got worse. <br><br>  After X-rays, he heard doctors talking about ‚Äúartifacts‚Äù found in his body.  An ordinary person would understand that these are fragments of a broken bone, the result of jumping out of the car on the move, but for Terry, of course, these were implants left by aliens.  He began to worry about what would happen when the doctors found alien technology, ran away from the hospital and tried to steal a pick-up truck from a hospital parking lot. <br><br>  He was arrested and sent to prison, where he tried to open the door by putting broken shackles from his glasses into the socket.  It turned out that they do not conduct current.  The guard caught him doing this, and eventually he ended up in a psychiatric hospital. <br><br>  Davis was discharged after a couple of weeks in a mental hospital.  There, too, was not without incidents - he refused to eat, fearing that the food was poisoned, and also threw a chair out the window.  After the release, he decided to be like Jesus, gave all his personal belongings to charity, and sent gifts to all his nephews and nieces. <br><br>  Davis says that, ‚Äúlooking back, I am not particularly proud of my logic and the process of thinking.  It all looks immature, childish and pitiful. "  Then he said that he felt guilty about how ‚Äúatheistic advocate of technology‚Äù he was, and such a work as ‚ÄúLittle House on the Prairie‚Äù [ <i>TV series 1974 - 1983 about the adventures of American pioneers].</i>  <i>trans.</i>  ], and also the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2590%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B8%25D1%2588%25D0%25B8">Amish</a> inspired him to a simpler life dedicated to God. <br><br>  Terry Davis was diagnosed with <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2591%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D1%258F%25D1%2580%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B5_%25D0%25B0%25D1%2584%25D1%2584%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B5_%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D1%2581%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B9%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE">bipolar affective disorder</a> , and later <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A8%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B7%25D0%25BE%25D1%2584%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F">schizophrenia</a> .  As a result, Terry received disability benefits.  In July 1996, when everything calmed down, he moved back to the parental home, having no money and almost no things. <br><br>  In 1997, surviving with credit cards and loans, Davis began to develop home-made CNC machines and designed a three-axis milling machine.  It works approximately as a 3D printer, only removes excess material with a cutter, instead of plastic printing the desired shape. <br><br>  Davis founded Home Automation and Robotics [Home Automation and Robotic Equipment, HARE]] [ <i>Eng.</i>  <i>hare - hare / approx.</i>  <i>trans.</i>  ] and made a prototype machine for more than a year until I realized that she had too many problems to become a consumer product. <br><br>  But while working, Davis wrote software for computer-aided design (CAD), which allowed the user to develop three-dimensional models of parts on a home computer, and for that time it was an impressive achievement. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4a5/111/478/4a51114781c547c264ecb26b3f37be60.jpg"><br><br>  1997 year passed quietly, Terry got a job in a third-party company as an engineer.  But at that time he still periodically suffered from manic episodes. <br><br>  In early 2000, he returned and resurrected a physical simulator, written by him in 1994, when he was preparing for a degree.  He called it SysSim.  He worked with equations and was not particularly useful, but he allowed Terry to return to the world of computers. <br><br>  In 2001-2002, Terry worked in a company associated with printers and developed microchips for refilling cartridges.  At the end of the contract, Davis spent some time relaxing, and then decided to develop another product for his HARE. He was going to release his own OS, which he would then call LoseThos. <br><br><h2>  LoseThos Operating System </h2><br>  In October 2008, Terry created the subreddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/losethos">/ r / losethos</a> , and an account with the same name.  He began to periodically make entries on losethos.com with programming subreddits. <br><br>  Some of them were meaningful, they explained that this OS was designed for people to ‚Äúhave fun‚Äù with it.  He wrote that he developed it as a platform for entertainment, and was not going to make a competitor to Windows or Linux. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6a5/898/a41/6a5898a41b092df4f8abed15af16903a.png"><br><br>  However, Davis posted other entries, a bit more confusing properties, with headers like: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/06e/76b/449/06e76b44903905e880681a5e39e591b5.png"><br>  <i>Artificial Intelligence Divine Song</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0c6/f1c/552/0c6f1c55260e3708e91bed9328a69c25.png"><br>  <i>Operating system of militant anti-atheism</i> <br><br>  Terry sent most of the entries to / r / programming, where they were ignored or minus.  In rare cases, when answers appeared, they were usually people who did not understand anything and asked what they should do about it, or criticized the project that Terry acted on his nerves. <br><br>  The OS itself was written in a special dialect C (later it became known as HolyC).  The OS was written from scratch, and contained 100,000 lines of code.  Terry claimed that creating a LoseThos from scratch allowed him to renounce the past and do something ‚Äúinnovative‚Äù, since his LoseThos was not compatible with anything else.  She worked with a screen resolution of 640x480 with 16 colors, which even in 2008 was somewhat outdated. <br><br>  LoseThos was also vulnerable to attacks from the simplest viruses and malware, and Terry bypassed this threat simply by not embedding network functionality into the OS.  Rejecting the Internet and LAN, Terry also did not add the ability to print documents, and therefore nothing that was created inside LoseThos could be shared with others. <br><br>  Therefore, Terry offered to run LoseThos in a virtual machine running inside a modern OS such as Windows.  And this raises questions about the purpose for which LoseThos was created at all. <br><br>  One of the features of the OS, added by Terry, was playing "songs of God."  The text appears on the screen, and the OS plays 4-bit music.  This has confused even more people. <br><br>  LoseThos may look insane, outdated and meaningless, but it is impossible to take away from a person such an achievement as developing your own OS from scratch.  An incredible amount of energy was spent on this project, and on Reddit it is often compared to building a skyscraper from scratch. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8d9/5df/0de/8d95df0de389b6753a604b0d27c22da9.png"><br><br>  The more actively Terry distributed LoseThos, the more reviews he received, and not all of them were positive.  He also began to take notes on sabreddit / r / atheism, entered into long discussions with users, and often his answers consisted of random words or quotations from the Bible, preceded by the words "God speaks ..." <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/082/b56/4d4/082b564d4b8ba02aae094780edffecbc.png"><br><br>  The need for conflicts on reddit made Terry lead attacks on atheism, and when no one answered him, he began to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/7jsah/bad_news_there_is_a_god/">argue with himself</a> .  However, he wrote messages not only on reddit. <br><br>  Terry left messages on <a href="https://forum.osdev.org/">OSDev.org</a> , regularly making notes about LoseThos, and then left mocking and rude comments to members of the community who could not start his OS, which is why many discussions were closed or deleted.  In January 2009, the LoseThos account was banned. <br><br>  In February 2009 I began to write more often to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/">/ r / programming</a> .  The more popular he became, the more people responded to him, interested in LoseThos and themselves. <br><br>  Terry, apparently, became more confident, and in the end, users began to ask him not to create threads related to each small update.  Soon, apparently, Terry's account was banned from creating threads on programming, so he switched to cluttering up comments. <br><br>  He also began to take notes on HackerNews, duplicating his posts to get more attention.  Terry also intervened in many of the existing branches of the discussion, trying to transfer the conversation to LoseThos.  Apparently, his patience at this point was exhausted, and when one user criticized LoseThos graphics, Davis answered him: <br><br>  You are all worthy of contempt.  You look at the graphics and conclude that the system is not advanced. "Then he added," you are all disgusting monkeys, "and then finished," you must all be praying on Linux. " <br><br>  In 2009, Terry continued to take notes, and the more people read his texts, the more inconsistencies they contain. <br><br>  At first, Davis stated that he chose a resolution of 640x480, because it allowed the graphics to be made faster, and then in 2009, he stated that he chose this permission because God had ordered him to do so. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/881/ce5/f55/881ce5f55342bb2b91c63a2a0533688f.png"><br><br>  Also, users made fun of the fact that in the properties of the OS was, for example, such an opportunity as the "Bible and church hymns", as well as other religious opportunities. <br><br>  By the end of the year, the account <a href="https://www.reddit.com/u/losethos">/ u / losethos</a> was deleted, possibly because of a ban on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/">/ r / programming</a> , and Terry registered the account / u / TrivialSolutions (now remote), after which he began to write from him, but his entries became more and more aggressive. <br><br>  Terry also created fake accounts, from which he asked questions in / r / programming, which he himself answered later, in the spirit that using the LoseThos would be the best solution to the problem. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4ed/d59/571/4edd59571826251b0f6a809b12ffd880.png"><br><br>  Terry also continued to write to HackerNews for 18 months without much success, and his account was ‚Äúdropped into the shadow‚Äù [shadowbanned].  This means that people could see the content only by turning on the option of displaying dead posts in the settings. <br><br>  To get around the ban on OSDev.org, he registered there again under the nickname TrivialSolutions, but was banned in less than 12 hours after that. <br><br>  Around this time, Terry first started making videos for YouTube, showing LoseThos there, creating instructions for use and making reviews.  Thanks to this, we were able to see and hear it for the first time. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yHkUF1ioGSs" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  He also signed up <a href="https://twitter.com/losethos">for a Twitter account</a> to share updates and news there, but since people did not have a way to find him there, these updates gradually faded away by 2011.  However, just when his hopes faded away, he was noticed in the <a href="http://archive.li/YV0me">Something Awful Forums</a> forum. <br><br>  User Jimferd created a theme, described in it his experience of interacting with LoseThos, and called it "a reference example of a case where" your OS is a piece of shit "."  He wrote: ‚ÄúEverything that caught my eye was blinking.  Less strong-minded people would have had a fit from just one installation screen.  And after I finally gave up, I had the feeling that I was having a fit. ‚Äù <br><br>  Studying the OS, Jimferd described in detail many of the features and games available in LoseThos, and then discovered the screen on which Terry listed his personal data, for example, phone number and address, as well as the history of the OS. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/018/fb2/30f/018fb230f5776c0b47335f7609e0b9e7.png"><br><br>  Jimferd continued playing with the OS, stating that "the C ++ language she uses is the same abortion victim as the OS itself." <br><br>  And although the Internet began to mock LoseThos, this post contained detailed instructions for installing the system, which made it more accessible to other people. <br><br>  Apparently, Davis was aware of this topic of discussion, because the next day he registered on the forum, complaining that he was banned from OSDevs.org, after which he began to troll comments in the style of ‚ÄúThe Lord says, shut up you already! " <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/11c/ea8/d1a/11cea8d1aed24079e7c1154eff0dfbe5.png"><br><br>  Since many ways of communicating with new fans were constantly closing, Terry found it difficult to increase the size of the LoseThos community, but with the destruction of his personality and ability to reason coherently, he found new ‚Äúfans‚Äù elsewhere. <br><br>  In 2011, Terry continued to post random Bible quotes and details of his life on HackerNews.  He mentioned that he lives with his parents and goes to a psychiatrist who is trying to help solve problems with his psyche. <br><br>  Around this time, his mental problems began to manifest themselves particularly strongly, starting with a series of tweets complaining about the CIA. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a89/8d1/e4e/a898d1e4e0f9cb061385bb44b104eb9a.jpg"><br><br>  After that, he called on people to shoot down CIA agents with cars, stating that he "managed to get one" in 1999. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8d8/d70/2d0/8d8d702d05121bd069278ea786477c13.png"><br><br>  He continued to make similar claims that agents annoy him, and that it seems to him that his parents (with whom he then lived) are his enemies. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7d3/887/420/7d38874203c2c1e7ec42bd424b32469d.png"><br><br>  His records on HackerNews were also filled with his rage and attacks against the CIA, claims that his psychotherapists were agents trying to powder his brains.  Around that time, in January 2012, Terry began to allow himself racist remarks.  He liked the word "nigger".  He often used it to describe the CIA and all critics of LoseThos. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a65/bc4/d0c/a65bc4d0c5ab69c1fd44f6e6d8cd133b.png"><br><br>  His racist tirades lasted for several months and gradually became worse, but instead of ignoring him, HN users began to pity him and express suspicions that he had mental problems. <br><br>  This opinion was shared not only by HN users - at the same time he posted posts on reddit, on MetaFilter and StackOverflow sites, containing similar aggression and racist statements.  In addition, he constantly wrote that agents are being sent to him to make his life more difficult. <br><br>  Someone posted on MetaFilter an entry called ‚Äú <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/119424/An-Operating-System-for-Songs-from-God">Operating System for God's Songs</a> ‚Äù, where he described the LoseThos he found, and shared it.  Terry later discovered this entry, and for 11 hours in a row wrote answers and comments. <br><br>  In this topic, Davis made many statements, including the accusation of the CIA in the absence of innovations in OS design.  He said that he missed his chance because he did not build a back door in his OS, which is why the CIA does not allow it to spread. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/807/a99/9c5/807a999c58f5429562ea972fb066b3d2.png"><br><br>  He also showed people exactly how he chooses random quotes from the Bible, which he then posts online.  This was his method of ‚Äúconversations with God,‚Äù to which he refers several times.  He believed that this is a digital version of a conversation in different languages. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3dd/e5c/81f/3dde5c81f554eb50cc6d7f0d0bf4905f.png"><br><br>  Those who have free time can explore this amazing thread of discussion that demonstrates Terry's mental state at the time.  Somewhere around this time, Terry says that he is over 40 years old, that he lives with his parents, receives disability benefits due to schizophrenia, and has been working on LoseThos all day for the past 10 years, hoping to monetize it one day. <br><br>  Thanks to these records, Terry began to gather a small online community and his popularity on the web began to grow. <br><br><h2>  SparrowOS </h2><br>  In September 2012, Terry released SparrowOS.  It was LoseThos under a different name.  For the new brand, <a href="https://twitter.com/sparrowos">new accounts</a> in social networks were created, as well as subreddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/sparrowos">/ r / SparrowOS</a> . <br><br>  The SparrowOS brand did not exist for long, and for the most part all this time the same thing happened as before.  However, it was around this time that the popular <a href="https://kiwifarms.net/">Kiwi Farms</a> ‚ÄúInternet culture‚Äù forum was discovered by Terry, further increasing his popularity. <br><br>  In March 2013, Terry last renamed his OS as TempleOS. <br><br>  TempleOS <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/552/a31/f70/552a31f70d57fce1bf7571f5727d68fe.png"><br><br>  After TempleOS was released, Terry created the appropriate Twitter account (it was later turned off) and a <a href="http://templeos.org/">new site</a> .  Davis seemed to be actively absorbed by TempleOS, releasing a large number of accompanying documents, new games and features for the OS. <br><br>  One of the games was called ‚ÄúAfter Egypt,‚Äù and Davis himself called it ‚Äúthe temple‚Äù and considered it ‚Äúthe most interesting part of the entire operating system.‚Äù <br><br>  In the months that followed, TempleOS changed in unexpected ways.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The first major change happened in July, when a video appeared on the site, now lost, and the inscription ‚ÄúThe Temple of God is over. Now God will kill the CIA before it spreads. ‚Äù </font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/515/c94/a61/515c94a61ca500f5d3d9234e17b64c74.png"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In September, Davis again changed the main page of the site, after which it became clear that the new purpose of the OS. She was supposed to be a tool for talking with God. </font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/46d/432/027/46d4320278a2d69c4400b0ee496b7b56.png"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Describing the game "After Egypt", Terry believed that using a timer as a random number generator that selects quotes from the Bible will allow users to find answers to all questions. In the next section of the site were a few questions that Terry asked God, and the answers to them.</font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fcc/57b/843/fcc57b843acfddbd349799948fd50aa2.png"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Since September 13, 2013, Terry has also used TempleOS to share his thoughts in the ‚ÄúTerry Davis Deliberations‚Äù section. The first rant contained several points about why Terry created TempleOS just like this, from a technical and visual point of view. </font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a7d/c3a/520/a7dc3a52044180cb1800ca9ecb8c1d6d.png"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">However, then the narcissistic inclinations of Terry manifest themselves, declaring himself ‚Äúa programmer, chosen by God‚Äù and writing about himself ‚ÄúI am the greatest programmer of the planet.‚Äù He also compared himself to the people who wrote the Bible and declared that for him nothing is impossible. </font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2d0/a7b/570/2d0a7b5701c9c871331825d4e93b39ef.png"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Such rantings and blog entries appeared for a while, ranging from small in size to notes from a dozen paragraphs, as well as the ‚ÄúGod‚Äôs answers‚Äù ‚Äã‚Äãto various Terry questions on the site.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In October 2013, Terry launched a YouTube channel, named after OS, and began regularly creating videos and screencasts with OS demonstrations. From this point on, the number of fans of Terry began to grow, and people, apparently, enjoyed watching the deterioration of his psychological state. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the first video appeared church hymns, composed by Terry himself, as well as brief instructions on how to work with the OS. At the end of 2014, Terry added another section to the TempleOS website, and called it " </font></font><a href="http:/www.templeos.org/Wb/Doc/Demands.html"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">requirements</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> ", since now TempleOS was called the "Third Temple of God."</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Requirements were a list of changes addressed to Linux, Microsoft, Intel, and other PC makers that needed to be carried out in order for computers to support TempleOS and load it as the default system. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">On this page, Terry declares himself the high priest of TempleOS and states that "I have divine authority to transfer requirements to companies from the computer industry so that they can make the temple of God more beautiful or more perfect." </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">One of Terry's requirements was to request Microsoft to support its Redsea file system instead of current systems, as well as removing the SecureBoot feature, so that users can use both Windows and TempleOS simultaneously, and TempleOS should be the default system.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In addition, Terry demanded that Intel release a ‚Äúnew ROM with TempleOS every seven years. It needs to be registered in all new x86 chips manufactured at the factory so that people can trust oracles, and simply because it is the official temple of God deserving such honor! ‚Äù </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In early 2014, TechRepublic published </font></font><a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/blog/software-engineer/templeos-an-educational-tool-for-programming-experiments/"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">an article</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> describing TempleOS. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The author praised Terry for loyalty to such a project, generally positively spoke about the OS, and did not mention such problems as Terry‚Äôs behavior and his outbursts of rage, noting that ‚ÄúDavis is a very open and self-confident person‚Äù. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At this time, Terry‚Äôs rantings and tweets became increasingly foggy, and his mental state continued to deteriorate. </font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/907/b52/da5/907b52da53efc97dcee9cebb0a03e88a.png"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Apparently, his paranoia was getting worse.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In June 2014, Terry continued uploading videos on YouTube. In one of them he showed how he creates his hymns, and why they sound so strange. Terry took random numbers from the generator and chased them through a program that turned them into sounds.</font></font><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DfMzl5S3pjg" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">After recording a few videos, Terry decided that he had attracted the attention of Larry Page, co-founder of Google, and recorded several videos for 12 to 25 minutes specifically for him. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Around this period, video recording turned into a spontaneous lesson, since Terry made several videos that began with the words ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what to talk about‚Äù and contain abstract reasoning about atheists or critics of TempleOS. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In all, Terry recorded 106 videos for Larry Page from July to August. From these videos you can learn something new about Terry, he talked about his rules and how the CIA made it his goal, trying to sabotage his project.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Two of his poultry were constantly present in the videos, he often stopped talking when they started tweeting, and continued the story only after they finished singing. He also expressed the opinion that stands above the world leaders, called himself a "follower of Solomon," and people who consider themselves more stupid nigga.</font></font><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FoTYV22qZTg" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The length of the videos gradually increased, some of them lasted for several hours. When Terry was losing the sequence of thoughts, he could come to anything. The variety of topics talked was astounding, and in this article it will be impossible to cover them all. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The more personal information about himself was given out by Terry, and the more videos he published, the more people learned about him, and his ego was constantly bloated. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At that time, Vice magazine wrote an article about him where he admitted that ‚Äúfrom 1996 to 2003, about six times a year, I had a manic episode, and I found myself in a psychiatric hospital,‚Äù and that ‚Äúin these few years, I really was crazy in some way. Now I am crazy in another sense. ‚Äù</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">After the release of this article, Terry, enjoying an increase in the number of people who know about him, began to make a video in the ‚Äútalking head‚Äù format, declared himself ‚ÄúHigh Priest of the Temple,‚Äù and declared that ‚Äúmy job is to look after the code and constantly make offerings. ‚Äù</font></font><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RtuVZT-YsUo" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">His tweets at that time became very chaotic, he again made statements about the murder of "The Nigger of the CIA" with his car, and for other acts of violence. </font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9a8/ac0/661/9a8ac06613b4a341615fa085b8c7b698.png"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This disruptive trend continued in November 2015, when Terry made a new section on the TempleOS website entitled " </font></font><a href="http:/www.templeos.org/Wb/Home/Wb2/CIA.html"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Why the CIA must surrender to the IRA</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> ." On this page, Terry made notes about Obama, God and niggas. </font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/572/4d2/820/5724d282088175313185c1c9b791ae4c.png"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Later, they wrote about Bill Gates and the CIA, and what they did to destroy the true calculations and hide ‚Äúreal knowledge‚Äù about programming from the public.</font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a3c/12a/169/a3c12a169e019f07485bde6069ab8017.png"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In February 2016, Terry restarted the TempleOS website in a new form, which became most famous for the turquoise background. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Terry retained all previous site content, adding a section to the Terry Blog, which became an update to the old section of Terry Davis's Deliberations. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It was in this section that </font></font><a href="http:/www.templeos.org:80/Wb/Home/Web/TAD/DailyBlog.html"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">his</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> most </font><a href="http:/www.templeos.org:80/Wb/Home/Web/TAD/DailyBlog.html"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">famous record</font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> was made </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">about his life "in the CIA prison."</font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ff4/b0b/750/ff4b0b750d3ef8a08db5b0315f5670b0.png"><br><br><h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Era live </font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">On March 16, 2016, Terry launched live YouTube for the first time. He praised God, read Hacker News, the OSDev forums and the blog of Diana Covern, known as the "girl physicist." </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">On Air Terry constantly called names his critics and the CIA niggers, and strangely talked about some of his conspiracy theories. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">These broadcasts again attracted the attention of users of Kiwi Farms, and the discussion thread two years ago again rose to the top after recording ‚ÄúRaising the old topic, now it has become even funnier.‚Äù</font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/14a/ffb/cae/14affbcae42b3abc8a3ad2f6d001a22e.png"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Soon this was noticed by other forum members and they drew attention to Terry, whom he was so thirsty for. Terry began to conduct daily airs, talking about what was going on in his life, debugging TempleOS live and talking about the CIA. Apparently, he liked to stream. In April 2016, he conducted the air for 12 hours, supporting himself with caffeine and communicating with users via live YouTube chat. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">However, the further, the more Terry lost touch with reality.</font></font><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mBgIBF9Y6PE" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In one of the airs, Terry mentioned that he was trying to contact Dianne Constant so she would help him program the physics engine in games for his OS. He said: ‚ÄúI am trying to convince a woman who knows physics to work with me, but I use the word nigga, and she probably does not want to have anything to do with it. She has all sorts of sponsors. ‚Äù </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And although he did not name her, he read her </font></font><a href="http://physicsgirl.org/"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Physics Girl</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> site </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">on stream </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">many times </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">, and the audience quickly realized who he had in mind. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Terry increasingly watched videos from Dianna‚Äôs website. He began to constantly send her letters during the airs and described to his fans how much he liked her content.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At the end of November 2016, during the broadcast, he suddenly saw the answer to his letter from Dianna, but he quickly turned off the stream before opening the message. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">During this period, it was found by users of the technology section of the forum 4chan. Most users, Terry's content, seemed to like it, but a group of users discussed the possibility of calling Terry during a stream and starting to mock him. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It was pretty simple to do, since Terry published his home phone number on the site, and kept the phone next to the PC. Soon, calls began to constantly come in during the streams, and thanks to the characteristics of Terry's personality, he was easily annoyed, which, apparently, was the goal of the callers.</font></font><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/B5YokNW7tIs" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sVd0rlTeQtM" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Over time, a part of the trolls decided that calls alone were not enough, and began to pretend to be Dianna Clovern to play on Terry's feelings towards her. And although Terry was able to expose most of the callers, one of them managed to deceive him and take advantage of his loneliness for the fun of the audience. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In early 2017, Terry's mental state continued to cause him problems, and his content became even less connected.</font></font><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HhXLReCv_dw" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At this time, Terry periodically talked about consciousness, loneliness, and when one of the audience asked him who he was talking to, Terry began to talk about what he ‚Äúdoes not know,‚Äù and made a remark about reality: ‚ÄúIf I had been asked about my reality, I would say that I am in a psychiatric program with fake Internet, and I try to tell them that it is God, but they don‚Äôt listen. ‚Äù </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">He also said that every day he does the same thing that he does not want to do, but does not know what else to do. From the outside, it seemed that Terry had spent so much time developing TempleOS that he could no longer stop. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Terry's condition worsened, and his viewers used his paranoia and constantly asked him in a chat to kill people from the CIA or asked about his opinion on various subjects.</font></font><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/N9c0-ZC-4-E" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The streams ended in March, when the fake "Dianna" sent him an email with pornographic pictures that got into the stream. As a result, YouTube has blocked streams. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">After that, Terry again started uploading videos and streaming on the hitbox.tv service, however streams were not stored on the site. After a week of streams on hitbox.tv, his account was hacked, and after he registered a new one, it was hacked in just one day. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This forced Terry to switch to a new kind of content, vlogy. He regularly sang on the camera compositions in the style of heavy metal or walking, arguing about something. He told viewers that he was basically recording these videos for Dianna, and that he was married to her. It is not known whether he invented it himself, or whether it was the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe unreal Dianna who sent him pornography.</font></font><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7wEZGPYiJ0c" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Terry also shot videos with various everyday scenes from life, showed his fans his room and Dianna, and it was clear how few things he had. </font></font><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sdZ0gok5HfU" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">During these walks, Terry usually came to the same place near his parents' home in Las Vegas. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">While recording one video, a black man passed by, and Terry greeted him, saying ‚Äúhey, nigga,‚Äù as a result of which they fought.</font></font><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dQNZiLBuzEk" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Shortly thereafter, his YouTube account was blocked for violating the terms of use of the service. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This was probably due to hundreds of comments like this: </font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5e7/776/46e/5e777646efd41493dcfc9b185e90ff8a.jpg"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Terry started uploading video to the TempleOS site, which turned into something quite strange after Terry </font></font><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DyFIKLW1SeCs"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">stopped taking</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> his medications. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In July and August of that year, he became very aggressive, drank a lot and recorded two videos about a quarrel with his parents.</font></font><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RAVx9uj2bCE" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer;

autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> In the next few weeks, when the drugs stopped working, Terry began to completely lose touch with reality, logic refused him, and this was evident from the content. </font></font><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TN266WkrPRs" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">On August 26, 2017, Terry was arrested on charges of domestic violence after beating his father. </font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/202/461/9b5/2024619b5d91e796703405cc8342f0f0.png"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">After spending some time in prison, and then in a mental hospital, he could no longer live with his parents and became homeless. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The trial of his case was scheduled for October. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At that time, Terry posted a link to material support on his website, and users of 4chan and 8chan sent him money. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Six days after his release from prison, Terry was again arrested for "indecent behavior." </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Terry later explained that he was urinating outside. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Soon he was released again. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">On </font></font><a href="https://kiwifarms.net/"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Kiwi Farms, they</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> carefully watched his actions after the popular yutuber Mister Metokur made a video about Terry.</font></font><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TcqWok8AubE" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  At that time, he lived in a van that his parents gave him, and streamed directly on TempleOS.org from his car.  Soon, his sister got to know about his situation and offered to pay him to stay at the hotel, but it never came to that. <br><br>  In October, Terry missed a court hearing and turned into a wanted by the police, after which posters with his image were hung all over Las Vegas.  Two weeks later, he was found and re-arrested. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/866/78b/48b/86678b48b24933a5de800b4aca1d04ef.png"><br><br>  But help came from no waiting, and forum owner 8chan Jim Watkins helped raise money and pay bail for Terry, freeing him on November 10, when the court date was set for January. <br><br>  Terry continued to make videos in his van, made content for Dianna, whom he still believed in her marriage.  Although during this period he began to realize that something was wrong here. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HWUAF2M4km0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Terry also shot videos for her where he masturbates, and uploaded them to the TempleOS website in special directories.  He also did this during many live broadcasts, regularly watched porn during the streams, but since he posted all these videos and streams on his sites, no one banned him. <br><br>  Terry also had problems with reality.  He had several episodes of logical reasoning, when he realized that something was going wrong, he believed that he was in some kind of prison, similar to the plot of the film ‚ÄúThe Truman Show,‚Äù but quickly rolled back to ‚Äúmarriage‚Äù with Dianne and thought she would move in to his van. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5-SJKJnZ9cg" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  In January, Terry stopped shooting streams, and members of the Kiwi Farms forum monitored his case in court to find out if Terry was imprisoned and if he was not arrested again - this would explain his disappearance.  However, he did not appear in court on January 18. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/938/480/3ef/9384803ef0bebd912ea3cde516f1b992.png"><br><br>  Later that month, Terry uploaded several clips shot in an unknown house that didn't explain anything, and then disappeared again. <br><br>  In March, Terry began updating content again while in Portland.  It was 1,100 km from his home in Las Vegas, and his fans began to suspect that he was living with some kind of relative.  It was unclear why he decided to throw his van and laptop. <br><br>  Content remained about the same, he argued on various religious topics and discussed his relationship with Diane. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/V4uODGhR55A" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Pretty soon, his fans began to search for him and spread their conversations with him on Kiwi Farms.  Some recorded their conversations with him in the form of interviews, with questions about programming and other technical topics, and published them. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/w2rpHdtj_Ic" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Users noted how sensibly Terry could discuss topics such as programming and computers, which was very different from topics like the CIA and religion. <br><br>  However, his condition worsened.  By May, Terry had already imagined that he had a psychic connection with Ilon Mask and General <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259C%25D1%258D%25D1%2582%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581,_%25D0%2594%25D0%25B6%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B9%25D0%25BC%25D1%2581">James Mattis</a> , and that they help him develop new opportunities for TempleOS.  At some point, it began to seem to him that Dianna was cheating on him with Ilon Mask. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nFFH7npobH0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  By August, Terry‚Äôs ability to concentrate on one topic and speak clearly was almost gone.  His speech was fuzzy, and his appearance was terrible. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/W_0qKfbjzOM" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  In the same month, shocking news appeared on the Internet: on August 11, 2018, Terry died. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/82c/cb3/e6b/82ccb3e6b218263b07bae53a52e2aef9.png"><br><br>  He got hit by a train in Dulles, Oregon.  It is not known whether it was an accident or suicide, but shortly before this event, Terry published the last video where he explained that he deleted most of his content because he did not want to ‚Äúpollute‚Äù the Internet and called himself ‚Äúterribly sick‚Äù.  This video appeared just a few hours before his death. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oH41gGBVpkE" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  At first, people decided that the news was invented, and refutations began to appear on 4chan, even in the form of videos.  Everyone believed that someone had hacked into the family members account on Facebook.  However, requests to the police and news confirmed the veracity of the information.  The train driver, as they say, considered the incident a suicide. <br><br><h2>  Terry Davis Heritage </h2><br>  Fans from around the world, having heard the news about Terry, began to place initiations in his honor.  Despite the fact that this man obviously lived a hard life, complicated by illness, people remembered all the best that he had, and wished him well. <br><br>  Many of the initiations can be found in the still active community / r / TempleOS_Official / - all Terry content is mirrored there in order to preserve it.  Terry fans also raised a large amount of money from donations made on his behalf to psychiatric clinics and charities. <br><br>  Many people who followed the development of events claim that the Internet only worsened Terry‚Äôs problem.  And even in a sense, led him to suicide - although, on the other hand, it can be argued that everything went anyway, and for the most part Terry received love and support from his fans.  Many of the fans offered him to live with them in a difficult time for him. <br><br>  We will never know everything about him, and quite a lot of information has already been lost.  He was obviously a genius, a clever and talented man, burdened with a mental disorder. <br><br>  Additional Information: <br><br><ul><li>  Archives <br><ul><li>  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7XZSFX4YhqzXbt513F2sEA">Terry A.
