      By the way, Maxim Kazakov became the winner of our first webinar competition - he asked Professor Belhauari a few questions about the use of artificial intelligence in the oil industry and the economy. <br><br>  Applications for the undergraduate program are accepted <a href="http://university.innopolis.ru/bachelor/login/">here</a> . <br>  Detailed information about the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/innopolis_university/blog/210994/">program</a> . <br><br>  Today we talk about Professor Mazzar and his research activities. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/490/3b0/946/4903b094617a8300bdbf5e6d77e02b29.png"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Professor Manuel Mazzara has throughout his career demonstrated flexibility, willpower and ability to adapt, along with a commitment to research, teamwork and mentoring.  In 2000, he worked as a system administrator at CS Labs in Bologna, (Italy), and in 2003 was a software development engineer at Microsoft in Redmond (USA), where he went through a good practical school, which later came in handy for a deeper theoretical activities in the framework of the thesis for the PhD degree in Bologna (Italy).  During this period, he also worked as a teacher and freelance consultant (in banking and private business). <br><br>  In 2006, Manuel was an associate professor at the University of Bolzano (Italy), where he taught courses in software engineering, Component Architecture Development and Software Reliability Testing.  In 2007, he worked as a project manager at the Technical University of Vienna (Austria) on semantically structured networks.  From 2008 to 2012, Manuel was engaged in one of the most interesting and unusual projects in his life - this was the DEPLOY project implemented at the University of Newcastle (United Kingdom).  This project brought together several participants, 4 of whom represented Bosch, Siemens, SAP and Space Finland.  The objective of the project was the introduction of software engineering technologies into production to ensure high product reliability. <br><br>  In 2012, Manuel also worked as a research associate at the United Nations International Software Technology Institute (UNU-IIST) in Macau, China, while combining this position with the position of a visiting researcher in Newcastle (current job).  Manuel worked on the automation of immunization procedures for third world countries and on e-health and sustainable development projects under the auspices of the United Nations Agenda 21 program.  This experience was the foundation for significant growth from a technical, managerial and personal points of view. <br><br>  In 2013, Manuel was based at the Polytechnic University of Milan, where he studied the issues of remote patient care and telemedicine tools.  Professor Mazzara - a person with diverse interests and hobbies, his skills and abilities in both the technical field and in the field of interpersonal communication are witnessed by many different stories of cooperation with his colleagues, business partners and students. <br><br>  We publish a translation of a publication prepared by M. Mazzara in collaboration with his colleagues: <br>  ‚ÄúSocial Networks and Collective Intelligence: A Return to the Agora‚Äù (2012), University of Newcastle <br>  Mazzara M, Biselli L, Greco PP, Marraffa A, Qamar N, De Nicola S <br><br>  Nowadays, obtaining reliable information is becoming increasingly important both in professional and personal dimensions.  However, it is very difficult to understand which information is reliable (the one you can trust) and which is not.  Say, is it possible to reliably measure the quality of information?  Can you evaluate which sources of information can be trusted?  We are currently studying an Internet solution to this ancient human problem, which we have called Polidoxa, from the Greek ‚Äúpoly‚Äù (many, several) and ‚Äúdoxa‚Äù (popular opinion, generally accepted state of affairs).  This old problem will be solved through ancient philosophy and processes using truly modern tools and technologies.  That is why the present work required joint interdisciplinary efforts from researchers with very different experiences and organizations from different fields. <br><br>  Polidoxa offers: 1) a trustworthy search algorithm that uses stigmergy of the user's network;  2) a social network based on trust, where the concept of trust is formed from network activity;  3) the holonic system, built to protect the "bottom to top" and social privacy.  This paper also describes the current state of development of traditional media as well as new technological phenomena, analyzing search engines such as Google and social networks (for example, Facebook).  The advantages offered by the Polidox system are compared here with the above systems. <br><br>  Link to the project website: <a href="http://v6portals.dnnhst.com/polidoxabeta/WhatisPolidoxa.aspx">v6portals.dnnhst.com/polidoxabeta/WhatisPolidoxa.aspx</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/213045/">https://habr.com/ru/post/213045/</a></p>
