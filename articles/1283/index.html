  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Libraries, free access to information and open source software</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <i>In fact, my translation of the article by Tina Burgen (Tina N. Burgen). <a href="http://www.linux.com/article.pl%3Fsid%3D07/01/10/167250">Libraries</a> published on Linux.com (Jan. 22, 2007).</i> <br><br>  Open source software and libraries actually have a lot in common.  Last but not least is the belief in free and open access to information and ideas.  Until recently, libraries did not enjoy all the benefits provided by open source software.  The reason for this is too specialized software and standards that libraries use: this includes interlibrary loans, work with meta-data, and combined search.  Until recently, the lack of paid support significantly hampered the installation and configuration of open source software, especially when the library does not have its own IT department.  Therefore, the open source alternative was often out of attention.  Now funding has improved and sponsorship of the development has had a positive effect on the collaboration of the libraries. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Today, several global companies support the development of open source software for libraries.  Firms help in almost everything, starting with the provision of hosting and ending with the installation and support of programs.  Therefore, the urgent need to maintain a special IT department in libraries sometimes disappears.  Here are some examples of implementing an open source project in libraries:

      <strong>Crowford County Federated Library System</strong> <br><br>  When <a href="http://ccfls.org/">CCFLS</a> in Pennsylvania started selling a new integrated system for libraries (Integrated library system - ILS) in 2005, she already had experience in implementing open source software for various purposes: content management systems, firewalls, etc.  A year after the run-in of ILS, director John Brice (John Brice) and his IT-team decided to release <a href="http://koha.org/">Koha</a> , the first and rather large integrated open source-system (open source ILS) to replace existing software in libraries. <br><br>  Koha is a functionally rich open source library system developed by <a href="http://katipo.com/">Katipo Communications</a> and operating at Horowhenua New Zealand Library Trust.  The project is more than six years old; developers from all over the world are taking part in its development.  Koha means ‚Äúgift‚Äù in Maori language.  This software is used in hundreds of libraries around the world. <br><br>  Crawford County authorities have decided that only Koha can offer what is expected from software of a similar level: freedom in customization (customization) and control over all development cycles.  ‚ÄúThe final decision to use Koha was made because of the possibility to modify the software according to our settings, and not to change them in order to fit the software,‚Äù says Mr. Bryce. <br><br>  Bryce believes that open source software is key to finding a competitive solution for providing custom services in a market battle with commercial players like Google and Amazon.  Using one system on the principle of "one size at all" is no longer effective. <br><br>  In the process of developing Koha, of course, there was a question about search technology.  The conditions were as follows: support for existing library standards and the overcoming of limitations in the search and the possibility of scalability when working with large amounts of information.  The choice was made on the Zebra project ( <a href="http://indexdata.com/">Index Data</a> ), an open source engine for indexing and searching.  CCFLS decided to help the joint project Koha and Zebra that founded the American company <a href="http://liblime.com/">LibLime</a> for outsourcing development support Koha. <br><br>  The implementation of Zebra was completed in the summer of 2006, and the CCFLS began the process of data migration and system customization.  The interface and functionality has been configured to meet the needs of the nine libraries in the CCFLS.  CCFLS system administrator Cindy Murdock described Koha as one of the most complex projects they have ever developed.  He also added that if there is a need to change the functionality of the system, then they will have enough of their strength.  That is, if the software used was developed by a third-party manufacturer, but in this case you would have to contact it and pay. <br><br>  Next month, CCFLS plans to launch Koha on the Internet <br><br>  <strong>Nelsonville Public Library System (NPL)</strong> <br><br>  When the Nelsonville Library (Ohio) switched to Koha in 2002, it became the first public library in the United States to use open-source ILS.  At the same time, the NPL was the first library to open online in November 2006, launching a new version of Koha - Koha ZOOM.  Like the Crawford district, the Nelsonville Library used the services of LibLime and commissioned Webmaster Owen Leonard, the official interface designer, to develop the webmaster.  Director of the Nelsonville Library Lauren Miller (Lauren Miller) believes that the use of open source software meets the philosophy of free public access to information. <br><br>  <strong>University of the Middle East (Near East University - NEU)</strong> <br><br>  NEU Cyprus chose Koha to manage its new library and cultural complex in 2006.  The NEU library has 250,000 shelves, it is open around the clock, and access is free for visitors.  Mr. Tyumer Garp, director of the NEU library, was disappointed with the work of the proprietary ILS, which did not work correctly with Turkish letters, which was quite a hindrance in the search for information.  ‚ÄúSince Koha is open source, we decided to implement this system to customize it according to our needs,‚Äù says Garp.  The positive results achieved by Koha at the initial stage of testing convinced the NEU management to fully switch to this system by putting together the search technology Zebra and the Koha directory system. <br><br>  The system also allowed to develop a mechanism for extending the period for which the book was taken, using SMS messages.  Mr. Garp sees the future of Koha very positively and draws an analogy with the Apache server: ‚ÄúWe believe that Koha has all the features and functionality to become Apache (Apache) in the world of the science of library information systems.‚Äù </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/1283/">https://habr.com/ru/post/1283/</a></p>
