Sometimes you want something more complicated and more matematic.  Like, for example, <a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/6830/zendo">Zendo</a> , released in 2001 by Cory Heath and having received several awards.  It represents a competitive game, built on mathematical induction and Zen-koans. <br><br>  In it, the players try to guess the pattern invented by the master, without directly conflicting with each other, but at the same time limiting each other in the amount of information, which the <a href="http://www.koryheath.com/zendo/design-history/">author tried to achieve</a> (by the way, this history of decisions on game mechanics is interesting in itself).

Instead of the original <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Icehouse_pieces">pyramids,</a> you can use colored chips of different sizes, shapes and colors (even just simply cut out of paper or taken from other board games), this will somewhat limit the complexity of the rules. <br><br><blockquote>  One player is a <i>master</i> , at his disposal part of the game chips (hereinafter referred to as chips) and a sufficient number of answer chips (you can take black and white stones from go, then stones), as well as guess chips (I will use the word "coin").  His role is to choose some <i>rule</i> according to which he will make game chips. <br><br>  For example, this rule is formulated as ‚Äúeat blue‚Äù (Buddha-dhata rule, in the original, there is at least one green piece).  The master must immediately put two initial <i>koans</i> from the game chips, the correct one that fulfills the condition (marking it with a white stone) and the wrong one (marking it with a black stone). <br><br>  The rest become <i>students</i> , who have to guess this rule and get one white and black stone.  Each turn a student can choose one of the following actions: <br><br>  1. Put your <i>koan</i> out of gaming chips and say <br><br>  1a  "Master".  The master at the same time puts a white or black stone under the koan, depending on whether the koan satisfies the conceived rule or not. <br><br>  1b.  "Mondo".  Each student (including the one who is walking now) and the master clamping one of the stones of the ‚Äúguess‚Äù in his hand, depending on how he thinks, satisfies the current koan to the conceived rule or not.  Then everyone shows them at the same time, and everyone who has the color of a stone coincided with the color of a stone by a master receives a coin.  Students' coins are saved for the whole game until they are spent. <br><br>  2. Or try to guess the <i>rule</i> by calling it.  For this he must spend one coin (if he has one) and say, for example, ‚Äúthree chips‚Äù. <br><br>  2a  If the student guessed, then all the chips from the koans are returned to the heap, and the master makes a new rule. <br><br>  2b.  If not, the master must refute the assertion of the student by the new koan, i.e.  lay out the right koan, which does not satisfy the player's assumption (for example, four chips, one of which is blue) and a white stone under it.  Or, on the contrary (if he wants to make fun of in the spirit of Zen-koans), such a koan that satisfies the pupil's assumption, but at the same time is wrong in relation to what the master made (for example, three pieces, but not a single blue) a rock. <br><br>  It is worth noting that this step is an opportunity to prompt the players in which direction to move in their assumptions, and the Zen master should use it wisely.  As well as tips that such a fan has already laid out on the field. <br><br>  2c.  Even if the student did not guess, as long as he has coins, he can spend another one more guessing attempt. <br><br>  Otherwise, the turn is passed to the next player.  At the same time, all the koans and stones under them remain on the table. </blockquote><br><br>  As you can see, the rules are simple and clear enough to limit players, but at the same time create enough competitive potential if your company has three programmers or people with technical skills. <br><br>  What rules to guess - it depends on what you use in the form of chips.  In the case of homemade cardboard, you can use the number, shape, color, size, orientation (rotation relative to other chips), direction.  Of course, the more difficult the chips, the more difficult and possible the rules, so you can glue pyramids from paper, or use different miples from different board games.  The main thing is that you have enough chips to ensure that at least someone guessed that, as a rule, you made a guess. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c40/d95/494/c40d954948d9bd05a171ee2f2911575c.jpg"><br><br>  At the same time, the rules should be drafted in such a way that they are short, do not allow double interpretations and are easily formulated.  And here the Russian language has an advantage over English.  Instead of ‚Äúall its pieces are the same color‚Äù, you can use two-syllable rules like ‚Äúmore than two‚Äù, ‚Äúone blue‚Äù, ‚Äúall are the same‚Äù, implicitly teaching players new types of conditions and new conditions.  Then move on to more complex ‚Äúno big squares,‚Äù ‚Äúat least three,‚Äù ‚Äúnot more than two,‚Äù ‚Äútwo chips touch,‚Äù ‚Äúone chip is turned.‚Äù  The number of words in the rule can be a hint, which can be voiced at the beginning of the game. <br><br>  Let's try to play a small game with Alice and Bob, whom the master wants to help achieve enlightenment. <br><br>  First, the master lays out the initial koans and with a gesture allows the students to begin. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/052/04a/aa9/05204aaa961c7a9367b335f854707808.png"><br>  Impatient student Alice collects his koan and asks him to confirm with the master.  And it turns out to be suitable for Buddha-Dhatu. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c5b/f67/52b/c5bf6752b86065cce91a4de9202adbd7.png"><br>  The balanced student Bob says ‚ÄúMondo‚Äù, gathering his koan, and everyone pulls each other's hands with squeezed stones.  When they open their fists, it turns out that only Bob guessed that this koan does not pass under the master's rule.  So he had such a cunning plan - to try to understand by a negative statement, and at the same time earn a reward from the master. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/134/0b9/3ea/1340b93ea233b066151a1164eaf72c24.png"><br>  Then the temperamental student Alice spends the money earned when they guessed the previous rule, and assumes that the pattern is ‚ÄúMost Yellow‚Äù.  But this is not so, and the master cites the example of a koan, when the yellow ones are in the minority, and yet the koan is Buddha-dhata. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/148/a8e/6f1/148a8e6f12f29e5c55fc41096806ea5b.png"><br>  Still pacified student Bob is not sure of his version, but the time and sequence of moves limit his choice, so he decides to spend the coin he has just earned on a hunch that still turns out to be true. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/49e/6aa/24b/49e6aa24b4037816b3d1b84dec4c1955.png"><br>  How to track the "winnings" in this game is your business, but in fact, most people with a technical mindset will enjoy even the otgadki complex rules, and the tension of invisible competition between players, which is created by the rules of the game. <br><br>  I hope you have someone to play with, you will love it! <br><br><h3>  see also </h3><br>  <a href="http://www.koryheath.com/zendo/rules-for-beginners">Some rules for beginners</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.koryheath.com/zendo/terminology/">Ways to build rules</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.playagaingames.com/games/zendo_some_rules/">More rule examples</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/365791/">https://habr.com/ru/post/365791/</a></p>
