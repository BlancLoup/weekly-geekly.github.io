Did you ever have to tell your friends and colleagues about the memorable letter?  I bet for most users an interesting and creative advertising list - a surprise that happens only a few times in my life. <br><br>  When sending an e-mail with advertising, a company should carefully think about how not to become an annoying spammer in the customer‚Äôs eyes and make him pay attention to the product or service offered: indeed, it‚Äôs usually not a matter of looking between the content of the letter and deciding whether to send it to the basket. more than two seconds.  How did leading companies manage to intrigue their customers?  In this review we will talk about the most successful and interesting email newsletters of recent years. <br><br><h4>  Treasure Island </h4><br>  <b>Petco</b> , a company that sells pet goods, turned the ad campaign into a ‚Äútreasure hunt‚Äù: a user who provided enough data, gradually received messages in the mail, on Twitter and Facebook, and, having passed several ‚Äústeps‚Äù on an improvised map treasures, could win coupons for the free purchase of pet products or a permanent discount in the company's stores.  Moreover, even if the prize itself was not of particular value, users still rushed to search for treasures: out of curiosity or intrigued by an interesting idea.

The letter contains an interactive T-shirt model and provides a link to an online store where you can purchase the proposed product online. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/8dc39552/a5cd61a1/e0a63f15/472bdaf1.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Urgent news </h4><br>  <b>Avis</b> International, a car rental company, has organized the <a href="http://www.avisfirst.com/">Avis First</a> program, which allows customers to take part in holiday-related promotions.  In order to take part in the promotion and receive gifts from the company, it is necessary to respond to the letter of advertising mailing within a certain period  This allows the company not only to play on seasonal excitement, but also to bring the news to customers on time. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/098ebac1/bf8bb86a/868dc402/3a9c8cf3.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Fitness by mail </h4><br>  The world-famous sports brand <b>Nike</b> used unsophisticated but effective tactics to increase the focus on its <a href="http://www.nikeplus.com/">Nike +</a> share.  The essence of the action is that each participant involved in running in the sneakers of the company can use a special miniature device that tracks the distance traveled and calories burned.  Information can be transferred to the Nike + site, where the user will be available statistics on the races.  E-mails confirming this operation contain direct links, a click on which will post the route and other race data on Twitter or Facebook. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/da1/8b6/088/da18b6088b0355433f6055a727cb60c0.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  $ 10,000 for everyone </h4><br>  Network advertising agency <b>Mother London</b> sent out a letter in the best traditions of Christmas charity, in which everyone is invited to receive a cash payment from the total amount of $ 10,000.  The client was only required to provide his name and bank details.  It is curious that only one person responded to the letter - the director and screenwriter Theo Delaney.  He received the full amount, which he later donated to a charitable organization. <br><br><h4>  Fourteen story letter </h4><br>  And, finally, the longest sales letter in the world, which was received by all clients of the Latin American amusement park <b>Beach Park</b> , which was offered a ride on one of the highest water slides in the world - Insano.  And there was hardly anyone who did not see the letter to the end - the ‚Äúdescent‚Äù on it captures no less than the hill itself: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8db/212/0d1/8db2120d1bee884df4f70b519c4a8b9e.jpg" alt="image"><br>  ( <a href="">Link to the original</a> for those who do not see the picture.) <br><br>  Twisted?
