  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Replenishment of the Yandex.Money account through the Contact system at Future Bank</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Recently ran out of money in your wallet.  I decided to replenish it.  Make it turned out not so easy.  I did not find the Yandex.Money replenishment service in the ATM of my bank.  I didn‚Äôt want to pay a large commission, since the price of money would then have increased :-) In the payment terminal ‚Äúkiwi‚Äù, in the next store, when I tried to pay, I could not figure out the menu.  Generally speaking, I don‚Äôt consider myself a stupid person (I‚Äôm working as a programmer, getting a higher education), but the menu is organized nontrivially, and behind is a line of people who just need to pay for mobile services.  I did not find payment cards in the neighboring shops.  They said that while there is no sale.  In general, after reviewing all the ways to replenish the wallet on the Yandex.Money website, I decided to use the Contact money transfer system, since I found such an item near my metro station. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Came there.  It turned out that this is a futures bank, whose partner is the money transfer system, i.e.  the bank works through an intermediary.  The procedure was not complicated and consisted of the following steps: <br><ol><li>  Cash withdrawals and their transportation in your pocket (if a large amount, it is scary :-) to the point of payment. </li><li>  Filling out the form with the data on which Yandex.Money account and how many rubles to transfer. </li><li>  Presentation of a passport. </li><li>  Filling operator documents. </li><li>  Receipt of two receipts for payment (about payment of the commission and the payment itself) from the operator and affixing the payer's list to them. </li><li>  Payment of the agreed amount in the cash desk of the bank and receipt of the stamp in the receipts. </li><li>  Presentation of receipts with the cashier‚Äôs seal to the cashier. </li><li>  Issuance of two payment stubs and a ‚ÄúMemo‚Äù sheet with payment details. </li><li>  Waiting for the transfer of money and receipt of their purse. </li></ol><br>  Now comments.  First of all, the payment procedure is slightly different from that described on the Yandex.Money website.  It differs in a pleasant way by the fact that in clause 4 the operator does everything he needs, and not you.  Secondly, the teller was not aware of how soon after the payment the money went into the wallet.  After my question, having searched the documents, the transaction officer showed me the document in which it was written that the transfer is processed on the next business day after the day of payment from 10:00 to 11:00.  Thus, the payment made on Friday was to be credited on Monday.  This thought was confirmed by the operator.  Thirdly, it turns out that the minimum profitable payment, i.e.  the payment at which the commission does not exceed 1.5% is 4,000 rubles, since the minimum commission is 60 rubles.  In four, paragraph 1 is risky, but this bank does not accept bank cards to pay for services, which is very unpleasant. <br><br>  As a result, I checked the money on Sunday, but found that they arrived on Friday at 22:00.  Let me remind you that I paid on Friday at 19:00.  The operators were clearly not aware of such efficiency :-) This was my first experience of replenishing Yandex. Money.  Earlier, money was transferred to me by a direct transfer from wallet to wallet.  If you know simpler ways to replenish a wallet with a minimum commission (or better without it), then write.  I would be very grateful, as I often use them. </div>
