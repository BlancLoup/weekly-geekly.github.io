A little thought and idea</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><h4>  Prehistory </h4><br><br>  I, like others probably, have been disturbed for some time now by the thought of the future development of social services.  networking and communication on the Internet.  And here it‚Äôs not even the speed of information exchange and its quantity, I‚Äôm concerned about the quality of this information.  Those.  since social communication, it is often personal: jokes, stories, flirting, and not a discussion of the development of business projects.  The scope of business projects and commercial communication goes via Skype, waves and other things - everything is clear and clear, there are a million tools. <br><br><h4>  Current funds </h4>

      What do we have today in social networks to communicate?  Gifts, messages, graffiti, photos, music, videos, emoticons, pictures - everything is beautiful and wonderful.  What is missing: and not enough in my opinion to see the face of the interlocutor.  Yes, there are Skype with video calls, but you cannot call a person every time you want to tell him a joke or tell a life story with the whole spectrum of your emotions and experiences.  For a) the Internet is not so fast for everyone, b) not everyone has a video camera, c) not everyone has time to listen to you right now, d) and there is not always time to answer you right now. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  My suggestion </h4><br><br>  On the Internet already today there are many solutions for creating avatars.  Even animated avatars.  But in essence, they are still static / cyclical.  There are applications for the iPhone and other mobile platforms for creating avatars: B-Bot, Avatar Creator and others - in which you can draw a comical cartoon / sketch of a person‚Äôs face, which can be done with high %% recognition.  Hence the idea: to make social.  The network is more lively due to live avatars.  Those.  transfer the emoticon function to the user's avatar. <br><br><h4>  Ideally </h4><br><br>  Remove all social menu.  networks and at the entrance to the personal page display only the list of friends, but in an unusual form.  In the form of a crowd of drawn characters with clouds of any phrases (message fragments to you, recent status updates or actions on the network, ala has posted a new photo or is marked on video).  Click on the person / character, he comes out from the crowd and starts to report his events in chronological order, changing his face (the most ideal thing: to communicate this with the voice of his real account host. Voice synthesizers will soon learn to do it after 1 voice calibration).  If there is a desire to comment on something - the crowd of other characters is darkened, leaving the background, the active character moves away and your character appears.  Enter your phrase, set the emotional state and "speak." <br>  A bookmark with your character, where you can write your statuses, notes, post pictures, videos, join groups, also need to shove somewhere, but it is not so important at this stage of submission. <br><br>  The idea described above is aimed at transferring one main idea: to revive and make more emotional communication in social networks.  The proposal for the form is made, the little things are not thought out by 100%, but are given for example. <br><br><h4>  Why not </h4><br><br>  t pictures in the post, boring to read? <br>  Because a) I don‚Äôt know at all what pictures to shove in here, b) I don‚Äôt know how to draw, c) and it‚Äôs not in pictures right now. <br>  Photos, namely animated avatars? <br>  Because a) you cannot look at them all your life, and you want to see a person live, b) to animate and store photos is much more complicated and more mistakes are possible during animation (smile curves, eye position, etc.) <br>  ‚àº live communication, and here is such a "cartoon"? <br>  Because a) you never need to throw out live communication, b) but live communication does not always coincide both with your plans for work, rest, and with the plans of other participants in the conversation, c) the ‚Äúcartoon‚Äù is intended to revive boring, same-type social networks and communication in them. <br>  He started doing this himself, but put the idea here? <br>  Because a) I could have missed something on the Internet, and somewhere they already invented and did it, b) a large audience - more opinions and more effective discussion, c) maybe someone from here will be able to do it. <br><br>  For now, let's discuss in the comments. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/85022/">https://habr.com/ru/post/85022/</a></p>
