This time the interview with Rock Star, the company's CEO, which at the end of last year was <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/11/30/productivity-app-evernote-gets-another-85m-75-in-secondary-financing-led-by-londons-acg-equity-partnersm8-capital/">valued at $ 2 billion</a> , was the most important thing.  More recently, a small startup founded by a native of the USSR (Stepan Pachikov, Phil joined the company later) is now worth more than a billion and is launching its startup accelerator this year.  In a short interview, Phil Libin says a lot of very interesting things about trends, self-education, about <a href="https://evernote.com/">Evernote</a> plans and how to maximize the chances of creating a successful startup (see under the cut in Russian).  The interview was made at the <a href="http://www.svod.org/">SVOD Summer 2013</a> conference (Silicon Valley Open Doors, held twice a year), a prestigious conference that traditionally brings together major investors from the United States and Russia, as well as being an excellent springboard for Russian startups in the United States (I will later post a full report with conference when we mount more videos).  It was with the help of the SVOD conference that Evernote received the first major investments, which Phil also said in an interview. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>What gives investors and entrepreneurs participation in conferences like SVOD?</b> <br><br>  This is where you go and learn everything you need to know about the foundation of the company, you meet with investors, my education, basically, took place at such conferences.  Moreover, participation in the SVOD conference was an important part of the fact that Evernote "left the ground" - I am sure that this conference can also be useful for many other people. <br><br>  <b>Let's talk about trends.</b>  <b>What are the most favorable areas for startups?</b>

      The best companies have always started out of current trends.  It‚Äôs probably too late to start something that is already a trend.  A startup has to start in the realm of your life, something that you constantly do, but which is not pleasant.  Look around for a few days, watch everything you do, find what you or someone you know well, do things constantly that you don‚Äôt like, and find a way to do it a little better.  This will be the best idea for a startup.  And if you specifically look for what is in trend, it will be you and 10 thousand others - too late. <br><br>  <b>What are Evernote plans for?</b> <br><br>  We have a lot of plans.  Everything moves very fast.  The main idea is that we want to make Evernote ‚Äúsmarter‚Äù - when we started, it was just an application for taking notes, searching and fixing.  Now it's autonomous intelligence - when you use Evernote, you feel that it complements your thoughts.  Many additional features will soon be added to make you feel that Evernote is an extension of your brain.  We have an excellent API, which now employs about 25,000 independent developers, whose number is increasing. <br><br>  <b>What about your startup accelerator?</b> <br><br>  This is really a very interesting thing.  We do it for the first time this year.  We are going to gather 6 teams from all over the world in Silicon Valley for a month to ‚Äúlive with us‚Äù, we pay for housing and other expenses.  There is a certain program for them, but they can also work with any of Evernote - any type of advice or help for their business.  We don‚Äôt know yet what to expect, because we‚Äôre doing it for the first time - so far there are only 6 teams, we hope that everything will work out, and next year we will make it much bigger. <br><br>  <b>Your personal advice to entrepreneurs</b> <br><br>  I think the most important thing is to do (build) something for yourself.  To do something that you will love, not to worry about pleasing the market and other people.  To make something that you understand that you will use it yourself, because the world is becoming very demanding, where the most important thing is to have a good product.  Therefore, especially if this is your first experience, your best chance is to make a good product for yourself.  If you do not do it for yourself, you will not understand how good it is.  But if you make a good product for yourself, there is a good chance that what you like will be enjoyed by a billion other people. <br><br>  Thank you for your attention and for the positive feedback.
