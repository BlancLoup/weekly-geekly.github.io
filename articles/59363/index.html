Advantages over CMS.  Contract-offer to use the service.  What you need to know.  Customer support.  Additional services.  Possible problems.  Company overview <code>(,  )</code> <br><br>  The service of renting online stores in the CIS countries is just beginning to develop.  As representatives of the service, most companies offer a boxed version with the possibility of renting for any period, plus additional services.  In the west, this service has grown into a more advanced offer called Software as a Service * - software as a service, which implies the outsourcing of the technical component of the store (an article on the topic of SaaS will be written soon).

      <br>
      Rent a store - one of the branches of the evolution of online commerce.  I believe that now any company entering the e-commerce market should begin its journey by renting an online store.  For small businessmen (a shop in a city, or a beginner) and an average (several shops with a good turnover), access to the Internet is accompanied by certain risks: the budget has a certain framework, so it can be tough to compete with market leaders.  In this case, there is always the likelihood that the business will be unprofitable (or the profitability will be too small). <br><br>  According to tenant companies, businessmen with offline business become customers, aspiring entrepreneurs, and there are more cases when businessmen cut down or turn off offline activities and go online. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Wanting to open an online store, businessmen often have no idea about the technical component, design, promotion.  They know their product, how to sell it and how to keep accounts.  Such clients want to give technical issues in one professional hands.  The output for them can be two options: <br><br>  1. Find a web agency that, for a certain amount, will make an online store with an original design, develop a corporate identity and promote the store.  Often the amount ranges from 2000 to 5000 USD <br><br>  2. Rent a shop.  In this case, the technical component, design and promotion fall on the shoulders of the provider.  At the same time, the cost of rental services and additional services is reduced significantly. <br><br>  <em>Buying a CMS and searching for artists on programming, design and promotion is suitable only for experienced online commerce owners.</em> <br><br>  Renting an online store, a businessman has the opportunity to test future business and virtually eliminates large material losses in case of failure. <br>  ‚ÄúThe most important thing is that the buyer of the store doesn‚Äôt care whether the rented solution is from the seller or not.  Outwardly, this distinction cannot be noticed, "- says Pavel Korotov, chief editor of <a href="http://oborot.ru/">Turnover</a> <br><br>  What are the advantages of the store rental service: <br>  1. Payment is extended in time and does not require large material investments at the start.  It is like a loan: it is often more pleasant to pay a loan more, but gradually, than a large amount at once. <br><br>  2. Carry out all the necessary technical measures, as well as help with the content and advertising of the store can the support service of the tenant for a fee.  Some technical activities are included in the rental price.  This solves the problem of finding other contractors. <br><br>  3. ‚ÄúIn addition, the rented store is almost immediately ready for work, you just need to add the product and call the wallet number.  While buying a boxed CMS, it must also be installed, set up and screwed in the design, ‚Äùadds Alexey Leonov, executive director of <a href="http://www.shop-rent.ru/">Shop-rent.ru</a> <br><br>  For all the indisputable advantages, there are also disadvantages: <br><br>  1. The risk of theft of confidential information about customers and the database of goods.  ‚ÄúFrom third parties, providers of such solutions are protected very adequately (they can allow the means and specialists in the matter of data protection).  It is difficult to protect yourself from insiders, therefore, only information relating to personal data (for example, credit card number) is protected, ‚Äùsaid Aleksandra Brovchuk, commercial director of <a href="http://insales.ru/">Isales</a> . <br><br>  ‚ÄúOur contract does not spell out the parties‚Äô responsibility for information leakage, since there is a country‚Äôs law that fully regulates the attitude of the parties when a similar problem arises, ‚Äùadds Alexey. <br><br>  2. In the case of a change of provider, there will be difficulties with transferring data to another functional, while there is a risk of data loss.  Alexandra advises to clarify in advance the availability of methods for unloading goods and transactions either into another system or in the .csv format. <br><br>  3. The dependence of the success of your business on the competence of the service provider.  The provider may not master your dynamic development, which may require changing it or hiring third parties.  Change is accompanied by certain risks, sm.  1 and 2. <br><br>  4. Contractors can be changed only in advertising and design.  The search for new can take a long time and there is a risk that the people found will be irresponsible.  But providers often limit third-party access to the store, which can result in numerous problems. <br><br>  5. Each functional has a number of specific features that are found only during operation.  This also applies to design, because  it is always drawn (imposed) for a specific engine.  Standard design versions have their limitations. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe design of a rented engine is almost impossible to change (except for logos, color solutions), navigation is what it is.  To alter the arrangement of elements in a standard design does not have the opportunity, "- Alexandra, Managing Director of <a href="http://www.alo-alo.ru/">Alo Alo Ru LLC</a> , shares the negative experience, using the services of the <a href="http://insales.ru/">Bornet</a> provider <br><br>  It turned out that there are 2.5 times more minuses.  But in practice, competent providers do not have most of the listed disadvantages, and the advantages outweigh. <br><br>  <strong>Contract offer</strong> <br><br>  Honestly, I have never entered into a contract for the provision of any services, some customers who applied to me to make an online store did not require a contract either.  Everything suggests that many work on trust.  Trust is good.  But it is worth considering what the trust of tenants can cost? <br><br>  It is necessary to admit that many firms are irresponsible and their actions can settle only the contract, but even large and responsible companies make mistakes, and they can only be responsible for them under the contract. <br><br>  ‚ÄúFrom the point of view of the client, the contract should have what is important for him: description of services, terms, prices, guarantees, property rights, terms of renewal and termination, maintenance conditions, confidentiality,‚Äù notes Alexander Frolov, managing director of <a href="http://www.shop2you.ru/">Shop2you</a> , and states : "The contract must be required!" <br><br>  <strong>Need to know</strong> <br><br>  Even in spite of the fact that at the end of the article almost all rental conditions were laid out with which tenant‚Äôs websites were supplied, it is necessary to check the information personally and ask questions to the support service: <br><br>  1. Find out whether the contract is concluded (if it is not on the site).  View contract clauses.  Unclear treaties are interpreted in the same way as they are written.  When registering a domain with the help of a tenant, find out whose name it is being registered in (necessarily in the name of the client) <br><br>  2. Find out all about the payment.  Hidden payments, specific amounts, the number of goods placed in the tariff.  Learn about the precedents of late payment services.  Specifically (complete list) that is included in the rental price. <br><br>  3. To study the demo version of engines.  It is possible to learn in advance about the functional from parameters, but the theory from practice differs in details - they are important.  Having studied the demo version, find out the average cost and timing of engine modification.  ‚ÄúFor a rented solution, refinement is an unaffordable luxury.  After all, in which case, the finalized solution will remain with the service provider, ‚Äùwarns Pavel <br><br>  4. Are additional services provided: promotion, assistance in filling the product catalog, etc.  In the absence of services, it is not a fact that third parties will be given access to carry out the listed activities. <br><br>  5. Clarify what is possible to change in the design, for what amount changes will be made in the design.  The cost of individual design. <br>  If you do the design on the side, you need to know how the design should be laid out. <br><br>  6. Ask a question about access to the third-party site, both from yours and from the tenant. <br><br>  7. Customer support is provided by almost all tenants.  But it is necessary to clarify clearly what questions the service will answer (technical, promotion, marketing, etc.). <br><br>  8. Find out in advance if you will be given a database and store design files when changing providers. <br><br>  Look at the company's portfolio, check whether the sites are convenient for the buyer, whether they open quickly, evaluate the quality of the design. <br><br>  <strong>Customer support</strong> <br><br>  Customer support as an important and relevant issue of renting online stores.  The support will largely depend on how successful the business will be. <br><br>  In the sales process, every week I encounter the fact that in the CMS of my store I have to fix something somewhere, change the little things.  Every month there is a problem to do something less serious in terms of functionality.  Such questions are addressed to the tenant and customers.  As you familiarize yourself with the engine in the process of work, there will be more and more questions about the capabilities of the system, there will be incomprehensible points that are not mentioned in the instructions. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe main issues are already spelled out in the‚Äú most popular ‚Äùwith a detailed indication of where to go and what to do (just by administering the store) - you can send any employee there who deals with this issue,‚Äù says Alexandra, the key is to start doing and watching and be able to articulate wishes in a language understandable to developers. ‚Äù <br><br>  If the provider's support provides advice on the development, marketing and advertising of the store customer should use it.  The provider's employees have extensive experience in organizing a catalog for specific products (each category of products requires an individual approach), they thoroughly know the functionality and have the experience of advertising other customers. <br><br> <code>   ,        ,  ,      .       .</code> <br> <br>  Responsibility, politeness, tolerance and competence of the support service - this is what is not said on any of the sites, but it has a primary task that needs to be solved before purchasing the service. <br><br>  ‚ÄúAs practice shows, users do not really like to read the instructions.  Therefore, more often we answer questions by mail or by phone.  We try to respond promptly, during the day, seven days a week, ‚Äùnotes Alexey. <br><br>  <strong>additional services</strong> <br><br>  <strong>Refinement functionality.</strong>  Often, beginners do not know what they want or what should be in the functional, because  they do not understand this, this fact was clarified during a personal survey of visitors on the Turnover forum.  Therefore, it is necessary to know in advance the cost of the service and deal with the demo version using the example of your own products. <br><br>  ‚ÄúMost often, changes can be made in the process of ordering, in charging discounts, working with wholesalers, determining the cost of shipping and displaying goods,‚Äù admits Alexander Frolov. <br><br>  <strong>Promotion.</strong>  One of the most popular of the additional services.  The psychological factor acts the same way: if the support works responsibly and competently, it means that the rest of the services are provided at a high level. <br> <code> :        -.    2-3 ,    6-  .    ( )?   ,         ,  ,   .     ,  CMS   .</code> <br> <br>  <strong>Design.</strong>  You need to know about the design before ordering its drawing.  You can draw the logo, but you shouldn't rush into the design.  Cost, terms are discussed with tenants.  The problem is that different layouts are needed for different engines, and there may be difficulties integrating the design drawn on the side of the design into the tenant's engine.  Some tenants warn about this. <br><br>  <strong>Content</strong>  Almost did not see the services of filling the site with content.  Most likely the provider can offer their services, for this you need to contact the manager.  The current average cost of adding a single product is 1.5 USD  (depending on the complexity; responsible executives).  Writing texts about 600 rubles.  for 1000 characters. <br><br>  <strong>Possible problems</strong> <br><br>  The problems of renting an online store are a thread running through the whole article.  In order for me not to repeat, it is enough to reread the article. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe rented solution makes the client seriously dependent on the service provider.  Therefore, many stores prefer to work according to the following scheme: first, the software is rented for several months, and then the program is redeemed, ‚Äùsays Pavel Korotov. <br><br>  ‚ÄúA few pitfalls were caught at the store‚Äôs promised registrations in the systems.  Supposedly bonus, in fact, the store is registered with those keywords that are needed by those who passed the engine for rent, which for newbies may not be noticeable at the start, but very surprising and annoying afterwards, ‚ÄùAlexander warns. <br><br>  <strong>Company Overview</strong> <br><br>  Sites are taken from search engines Yandex, google.ru and google.com.ua.  The information was taken from the pages of the sites and not coordinated with the support service, there may be some inaccuracies due to an illiterate description of the services on the sites. <br><br>  List of services: <br><br>  <a href="http://www.shop2you.ru/">Shop2you</a> (with comments by Alexander Frolov) <br><br>  <strong>Clearly: the</strong> cost of opening is 3000 rubles.  Rents from 600 rub.  Duration of opening is from 5 days <br><br>  <strong>Optimally: the</strong> Classic tariff (it corresponds to the normal set of functions), the rent of which costs 1500 rubles. <br><br>  <strong>The price includes: the</strong> creation of two pictures for the site‚Äôs caps, and an individual color setting (elementary color change of the design elements).  This is in 8 variants of ready-made free templates.  Those.  backup support and storage. <br><br>  There is a demo version <br><br>  <strong>It is not clear:</strong> "It is possible to install your design" - check with the manager how much it is free, because  from the words on the site is not clear. <br><br> <code>      HTML  ,      ,  Lite  Classic  6000  (       )</code> <br> <br>  ‚ÄúSpecialist consultations‚Äù, it is unclear what kind of consultation plan.  If on the engine, it is everywhere for free, even with the purchase of a CMS. <br> <code>           ,    -,    </code> <br> <br>  "Solving the problem with hosting" - it is not clear what they mean?  Free hosting or you provide it for a fee? <br> <code>   .        .</code> <br> <br>  It is not said about the opportunity to buy a fully boxed version. <br> <code>   .                  .</code> <br> <br>  No word on contract or agreement <br>  I agree, we need to prepare a documentation section on the site. <br>  We work with individuals under an offer agreement, which can be found when ordering a store.  With SP and legal entities we conclude exactly the same contract, which differs only in the header. <br><br>  <a href="http://shoparsenal.com/">Shoparsenal</a> <br><br>  I took them only for the fact that they are quite high in the search.  This is their only plus. <br><br>  <strong>It is clear:</strong> Rents from 700 rubles.  Installation in 2 days.  Hosting is included in the rental <br><br>  <strong>The price includes: the</strong> provision of advice on promotion, advertising, revision, it is in addition to technical issues. <br><br>  Development of a unique design from $ 200. <br><br>  There is a demo version.  It is possible to buy a fully boxed version. <br><br>  <strong>Optimally:</strong> PRO tariff, rent 700 rubles per month.  Functional enough for a full-fledged store.  The guys took the basis of Shop-script PRO. <br><br>  <strong>Not clear:</strong> There is not a word about the contract or agreement.  No portfolio.  The site is vague and casts great doubts about the quality of the company's work. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.insales.ru/">Insales</a> (with comments by Alexandra Brovchuk) <br><br>  <strong>It is clear:</strong> Rent from 0 rub month.

There is no specific reference to the description of services.  Judging by the "Agreement", the services include only technical support and the provision of the engine (not a word about hosting!). <br> <code>, -  "must be done".
