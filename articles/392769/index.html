He said, "Let's go," He waved his hand ... His portrait on icons, magnets, billboards and subway cars.  Soon they will be raised on the banners, and canonization is only a matter of time.  All the "true patriots" know that we are the first and kosmosnash, and ask something about the modern space program, nothing but "we carry Americans" and "Americans fly on our engines" will not say, well, maybe even "Angara - environmentally friendly rocket" and "In the year 2030 we will be on the moon." <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I have already lost count of how many times in the last month I wrote something like "We are a youth movement, on the eve of the 55th anniversary of the flight of Gagarin we are holding a contest / event / flashmob ... Tell your readers about us."  And it‚Äôs not even interesting to ask where they were before and where they will get after April 12th. <br><br>  In my opinion, Gagarin flew not to be remembered every time when someone wants to emphasize superiority over the rest of the world, even though this was achieved half a century ago and in another country.  Gagarin opened the door for us to another world, so that we could go further, develop his success, and each step forward is the best honor of his feat and tribute to memory.  Gagarin should inspire new achievements, by his example set the vector of movement forward towards the development of science, technology, and upward towards space exploration, and not line up on the square with his name or portrait.

      And I wondered: who can we be proud of right now?  Are there any worthy to become the idols of modern boys, who do not look from the yellowed newspapers, but walk with us through the same streets, whom you can navigate, whose activities you follow, who you can shake hands with and meet thanks for his work in space and on Earth ? <br><br>  I decided to present my "dream crew", which, in my opinion, on any day of the week you can equip an interstellar expedition, and send it to discover new worlds and conquer new Earths. <br><br>  <b>Sergey Krikalev</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/184/e1d/5d3/184e1d5d3564b128e39ee8229e4bc69b.jpg"><br><br>  My unconditional idol.  It seems that while I was growing up from kindergarten to conscious post-graduate life, Krikalev flew.  In reality, he became the astronaut who took off from the territory of the Soviet Union, and sat down in the CIS.  For which he received the star Hero of Russia No. 1 (in fact, not for that, but for having worked two five-month expeditions in a row, instead of one).  It seems that with his participation the most key moments of the history of the manned cosmonautics of Russia passed.  Who will fly the shuttle?  Krikalev.  Who will open and turn on the ISS?  Krikalev.  Who flies into space six times, will spend there in the amount of 803 days, and almost two days in outer space?  Krikalev.  Who will lead the ship through the wormhole and save humanity from extinction? .. <br><br>  That's true, when someone tried to criticize the film " <a href="http://zelenyikot.com/interstellar/">Interstellar</a> ", expressed the following argument: that the main character is a farmer, flew a long time ago, it does not happen that he took everything in mind and flew.  And I will say what happens!  For ten years now, Krikalev has not been in the Cosmonaut Detachment; he has been engaged in bureaucratic activities on the ‚Äúfarm‚Äù of Roskosmos.  But I am sure that on any given day you can approach him and say: "Sergei Konstantinovich, you have to fly," and he will immediately forget the vegetable beds surrounding him, get the worn-out Falcon spacesuit from the working portfolio, and say: "Now, only my daughter will warn you not to wait for dinner. " <br><br>  <b>Gennady Padalka</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/604/5c9/52a/6045c952a11d0864feeff9a10f531d10.jpg"><br><br>  The same age Krikalev, but flew into space 10 years later.  Today's undisputed champion in total stay in space - 878 days.  Two and a half years not on Earth!  In orbit as a job.  I managed to spend one expedition on the "World", but the main work on the ISS.  When landing in September 2015, the Soyuz led almost single-handedly, since on the sides were inexperienced Dane and Kazakh, who had flown in just 10 days.  When he landed, to the question: "Well, how?", He <a href="https://esquire.ru/wil/gennady-padalka">answered</a> , thoughtfully chewing an apple: "It should be a thousand." <br><br>  Give him a thousand, send one more expedition, and his record will not be beaten until the very flight to Mars.  Yes, yes, they fly into space not for records, but for work and science, but do you really know someone who can cope better than Padalka? <br><br>  <b>Pavel Vinogradov</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/262/2b0/8c1/2622b08c1ac9f51ae7fd0ea3bc9b8f31.jpg"><br><br>  The most adult of astronauts.  To meet the sixtieth anniversary in orbit is not given to everyone.  Once we talked with Paul personally.  The result was a series of interviews on various topics ( <a href="http://zelenyikot.com/talkingwithspaceman/">1</a> , <a href="http://zelenyikot.com/talk-with-cosmonaut/">2</a> , <a href="http://zelenyikot.com/talk-with-cosmonaut2/">3</a> ).  Three hours, in flight from Irkutsk to Moscow, I pestered him with our questions, and he was responsible for the word and did not climb.  To be honest, I did not dare to lay out everything that he had spoken, despite the fact that he was not ashamed of the tape recorder, and was aware that I was not asking for myself. <br><br>  Pavel, as an engineer, participated in the development of Buran;  as an astronaut, participated in the repair of the Mir station after its <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D1%2588%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F_%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0_%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B9_%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B8_%25C2%25AB%25D0%259C%25D0%25B8%25D1%2580%25C2%25BB">collision</a> with the Progress spacecraft;  on the ISS station for six months was the commander of the expedition.  He has a unique experience of ‚Äúentering the closed space‚Äù - into the depressurized module ‚ÄúSpectrum‚Äù of the ‚ÄúMir‚Äù station. <br><br>  Now Pavel Vinogradov is 62 years old, but he is still in the Cosmonaut Detachment and, I hope very much, he will still fly.  Paul is all in the work.  You‚Äôve seen it for the first time in your life at the MCC in the Moscow region Korolev, and Vinogradov is there.  You will hear about the astronaut who was <a href="http://novosti-kosmonavtiki.ru/mag/2016/2528/30551/">forgotten to be rewarded</a> , and Vinogradov stood up for him.  You will meet someone's delights from visiting Baikonur in the social network, look at the pictures: "Hello, Pavel Vladimirovich."  Maybe Roscosmos has several?  And what, going to the stars, it would be useful to bring along a couple of Vinogradovs. <br><br>  <b>Sergey Ryazansky</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/86f/940/618/86f9406185590da432a5d28217538d8a.jpg"><br><br>  The only cosmonaut-scientist in the history of the ISS.  All cosmonauts (not to be confused with astronauts) at the station before him and after had engineering or pilot specialties before joining the Cosmonauts Detachment.  And he was a biologist at the Institute of Biomedical Problems.  Astronauts, of course, are engaged in orbit with science, experiment, collect data, but all this is done according to clear instructions written by scientists, authors of experiments, on Earth.  The cosmonaut and scientist Sergey explains the rarity of the profession combination simply: "You are engaged in either health or science, it is difficult to combine."  But he is joking, because  besides biological education, he also has engineering, i.e.  ‚Äútwo in one‚Äù, which is why he gained an advantage when entering the squad.  Well, and health as an astronaut.  After all, in orbit the main task is to maintain the station‚Äôs working capacity, and science in its spare time from the BBZ. <br><br>  Here, some not-so-distant patriots rejoice at the fact that Americans pay us for places in the "Unions" and cannot fly themselves.  The right patriots should wish every success to the American manned program, since it will free up one place on every flight of our "Union" and, you see, Russian scientists - the authors of the most interesting experiments - will have the opportunity to conduct them in orbit independently, after a simplified "tourist" preparation. <br><br>  Do you guys get the hint?  We did homework on algebra, and now march to the horizontal bars! <br><br>  <b>Mikhail Kornienko</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/526/082/175/526082175050d40f61c780f07f0afc51.jpg"><br><br>  Member of the annual flight to the ISS.  Total made two flights, one of them lasting 340 days.  For what has been made by Fortune magazine in the list of the 50 most influential earthlings of 2015.  Immediately after landing, I trained in a spacesuit on the surface of the planet, that is, I was preparing to go to Mars.  So now many astronauts are training, and Ryazan and Padalka, but Mikhail flew twice as long before that, which means his condition was closer to what a person will have after the Earth-Mars flight. <br><br>  The annual flight is not the first in the history of the national cosmonautics, and Valery Polyakov has a record 437 days without landing, but this was back in the 90s.  Now research methods have developed, medical technology has become more advanced, and thanks to Michael, and his partner from NASA, Scott Kelly, scientists managed to obtain new important data that will be useful in flights to Mars and to other stars. <br><br>  I also managed to talk with Mikhail, but remotely - by <a href="http://zelenyikot.com/iss-talk/">phone on the ISS</a> .  His experience and training will come in handy in a starship, though I am afraid he will be very sad on Earth.  Mikhail is a fan of the Russian forest, and he will miss him on Gliese 581g, he will have to take seedlings of birch trees with him and plant them at the landing site, and it is better to use hazel, mushrooms and hedgehogs. <br><br>  <b>Mark Serov</b> <br><br><img height="667" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d6e/f1b/399/d6ef1b3995541a5b96784ef779e288fe.jpg" width="500"><br><br>  Few people know this astronaut, because  he never flew into orbit.  Maybe someone met his blog " <a href="http://rsc-etestpilot.blogspot.ru/">Test Cosmonaut</a> ."  The main business of Mark's life is the construction of a new spacecraft "Federation" (the old name PTK NP).  For flights to the stars, this ship is not adapted, but if you fly to the Moon, to asteroids or to Mars - it will not do without ... Mark enthusiastically talks about his work in the blog and in life - sometimes he is invited to give a lecture on the Moon and that as he brings her conquest. <br><br>  If Roskosmos does <a href="http://zelenyikot.com/russia-to-moon/">meet on the moon</a> in 2029, Mark should be in the crew, since  no one knows him better than the Federation.  By the way, this will be not only the first Russian on the Moon, but also the first karate, therefore, I think, Japan should invest in the project, and in all karate sections of the world there should be a Mark for the Moon bank.  I think it will turn out to speed up the development of the ship and bring the flight to a natural satellite of the Earth closer.  Mars is also possible ... <br><br>  As I said, in space, we need not only engineers, but also scientists.  And if you fly to other stars, then you cannot do without biologists and physicians. <br><br>  <b>Luna 2015</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c9f/986/271/c9f9862717efca91859e62aadd312961.jpg"><br><br>  Six women scientists took part in an isolation experiment at the Institute for Biomedical Problems.  Their experiment can be considered rather modest, only nine days, but it was designed not only according to all strict scientific standards, but also at a high level from the point of view of popularization of scientific activity. <br><br>  <b>Elena Luchitskaya</b> <b><br></b>  <b>Daria Komissarova</b> <b><br></b>  <b>Polina Kuznetsova</b> <b><br></b>  <b>Anna Kussmaul</b> <b><br></b>  <b>Inna Nosikova</b> <b><br></b>  <b>Tatyana Shigueva</b> <br><br>  Worthy example to follow all the females from small to large.  Now they are not only continuing to work at the institute, but also actively engaged in popularization.  Their noticeable red overalls can be seen at many public events related to science or space. <br><br>  Of course, astronauts are the pinnacle of a huge multi-level technological, scientific, and economic system.  Personalized embodiment of the results of the work of tens and hundreds of thousands of people who have invested their time, talents and efforts in the development of astronautics.  And do not forget that to take part in space exploration is possible not only in the role of an astronaut.  I can advise all students to lean on mathematics, physics, and English, not to skip physical education, to strive, to work and not to give up the dream.  The latter is relevant in principle for all! <br><br>  <b>Happy Cosmonautics Day!</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/392769/">https://habr.com/ru/post/392769/</a></p>
