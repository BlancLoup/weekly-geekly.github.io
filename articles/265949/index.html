  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Conference C ++ Siberia'2015</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello! <br><br>  In late August, a C ++ Siberia conference was held in Novosibirsk.  This is a reporting post with thoughts about the conference breaking the covers and announcing the following events.  There is also an overview of the conference attendance motivation and the first video from the conference: Eric Niebler's opening report on the Ranges library, which will be included in STL v2. <br><br>  Welcome! <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Student motivations </h2><br>  Just a couple of weeks before the conference, we contacted a representative of the university's IT community and offered free tickets for students.  To get a ticket, you had to write a couple of sentences about your motivation.  We analyzed the reasons why students want to attend the conference.

    <ul><li>  <b>Training.</b>  The most common reason.  The conference is seen as an opportunity to learn new knowledge. </li><li>  <b>Communication with colleagues.</b>  In our era of steam and electricity, many still prefer live communication, yes. </li><li>  <b>Targeted reports.</b>  Everyone will find their report. </li></ul><br><br><h2>  The conference </h2><br>  Last time when we were in Novosibirsk, 120 people came to participate.  This time 160 people decided to attend the conference.  We prepared one track on the first day and the second half of the track: we decided to take the second half into blitz reports.  Unfortunately, there were no volunteers to speak with the blitz reports. <br><br>  In general, the program turned out good and different.  For the first time there was a report on such a burning topic as the assembly of large C ++ projects.  Traditionally for Novosibirsk talked about functional programming.  We discussed one definition rule.  and new to us Concepts Lite.  In general, as always, the reports were chosen solely for reasons of "what is interesting for the organizers to hear."  In a couple of weeks we will finish processing the video and you will be able to evaluate the reports yourself. <br><br><h2>  Disruption of integument </h2><br>  Of the 160 participants, about 100 came on the tickets paid by the companies.  For the first time I saw outstanding tickets for a paid conference.  No, I understand that something could happen.  But here from different companies there were 8 people.  It would be better if we gave the students these places, honestly.  I hope that people who asked the company to buy them tickets, and then did not come to the conference now read this text.  Not only did you throw the company's money into the pipe, you also deprived someone else of a place at the conference. <br><br><h2>  Announcements </h2><br>  The next conference will be held in February 2016 in St. Petersburg.  Several interesting speakers have already appeared on it.  Submit a report, as always, <a href="http://meetingcpp.ru/%3Fpage_id%3D63">here</a> .  You can already <a href="https://c-user-group-russia.timepad.ru/event/243187/">buy</a> early bird conference tickets, making the life of the organizers easier. <br><br>  Traditionally, a couple of free meetings will be held before the conference.  So far we can not say where: where the free wind and local communities will take us.  We are always happy to help with the organization and speakers.  The next meeting is likely to take place in Yekaterinburg.  Announcements of meetings will definitely be <a href="http://meetingcpp.ru/">on our website</a> . <br><br><h2>  First video </h2><br>  For dessert, the most delicious!  The first video from the conference: Eric Niebler, Ranges for the Standard Library at C ++. <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/gOKHcQad7xE%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700019,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjdA7giRXV8YUax_IO97_T8uoJHDw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Thank you for your interest in our conferences and meetings! <br><br>  <b>UPD</b> Updated video. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/265949/">https://habr.com/ru/post/265949/</a></p>
