As always, I chose about a week, thoroughly studying information from reviews, trying to skip yellowing, and, nevertheless, I chose.  At first glance at the specifications from the official site, I felt a sense of future deceit, because  I did not believe that this keyboard is able to work for 3 months in complete darkness.  However, having studied more user reviews (which, by the way, could be fake), decided to take it all the same.  Today I can and I want to provide you with an overview of this keyboard from my point of view. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

    <h4>  TTX </h4><br><ul><li>  full-size keyboard with a digital unit; </li><li>  solar powered; </li><li>  3 months of work in complete darkness (according to official statements); </li><li>  431 x 161 x 7.5mm; </li><li>  14 additional keys; </li><li>  wireless communication using logitech receiver unifying. </li></ul><br><br><h4>  Dimensions, ergonomics, design </h4><br><br>  The keyboard is made in the form of a white trough, in which all the entrails are located.  Above this disgrace is covered with black glossy plastic, which, of course, collects all your fingerprinting on yourself.  So it looks in normal, combat conditions: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/e89d7520/d114431e/3cf4e590/17fb4511.jpg"><br><br>  The keys are matte, with white characters of sufficient size.  Marking, indicating additional functions of the keys, made in yellow.  Instead of the context menu call key, there is the Fn key, with which you can use the additional keys.  The idea migrated from laptops, certainly.  To press the context menu key, press the Fn and Print Screen keys. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/99bff2c7/1e150bd7/7756cbb9/2d98279c.jpg"><br><br>  The official site has a keyboard with an English layout, but the Russian layout, as is usually the case, is different from the English one.  Look at this horror: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/0915171d/cfc1bb26/421d25bf/025bc242.jpg"><br><br>  The keys are made in the "notebook" style, but their progress is a bit more.  Also, the latter make a sound of moderate strength when pressed.  Typing is convenient, but after switching from a netbook (EEE PC 1215N) I had to get used to the fact that the keys are spread over the keyboard. <br>  The keyboard thickness is 7.5mm. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/f9a8d569/5cb485ff/d24f4bd2/80d743cc.jpg"><br><br>  Behind the keyboard there are legs on which you can put it.  They look flimsy, I do not use them. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/46559133/50132332/00d8b3cc/6fd522aa.jpg"><br><br>  In the upper right corner there is a keyboard on-off switch, an LED display unit that indicates whether the keyboard is light or not.  Also here is the call key of the Solar App application, which comes in the package and collects information on keyboard power.  About him a little later. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/48ef78f5/e1760c09/215faf92/f7d486e2.jpg"><br><br>  All the data that I found on the weight of the keyboard, indicate 680g.  Inclined to believe it. <br><br>  So, if you still do not turn up from this keyboard, continue to the most interesting, stuffing. <br><br><h4>  Wireless and solar panels </h4><br><br>  Keyboard wirelessness is supported by the Unifying Universal Receiver, which uses logitech for all of its wireless solutions.  At the moment I have a keyboard and a mouse logitech m505 attached to one receiver.  The receiver is small, it takes 1 USB port from which I took it 10 times a year (I purchased the mouse a year ago). <br><br>  According to the manufacturer, the keyboard works for 3 months in complete darkness.  I could not verify the veracity of this statement, and did not want to.  However, the fact is, the battery charge during the entire time of use has never dropped below 100%.  As a battery, the keyboard uses a battery-cake, which can be replaced by another: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/f61e031f/eff0c8dc/f16f2683/3ccb9129.jpg"><br><br>  The application "Solar App" allows you to control the illumination of solar cells in real time, whereas the two LEDs on the keyboard only inform about the prosperity or lack of lighting. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/d5b1554b/9d8f0592/5d40c510/8874ce8f.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/906189c9/f80b5741/9ab8a3de/87e3d148.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Impressions </h4><br><br>  If we take into account the fact that I took the keyboard as another toy, then I am pleased with the result.  Although, recently I have noticed for myself that I often use the keyboard as the main one.  In general, USD100 was not wasted, although it had to get used to the narrow ‚ÄúShift‚Äù key. <br><br>  I will try to comment on the questions in the comments. <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/122732/">https://habr.com/ru/post/122732/</a></p>
