In somalia</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Friends! <br><br>  I honestly do not try to advertise the project, but really want to hear the opinion of the habrosoobschestva about.  For it is very much objectively and valuable opinions Habra, as practice shows. <br><br>  I live in Somalia (more precisely, in the unrecognized state of Somaliland on its territory) and for the third year I have been engaged in the development of the higher education system (and also the Pirate Party of Russia - although this is not the case, an interesting coincidence). <br>  Thinking over what kind of activity to teach local people (weaning from piracy), I came across the news that by the end of the year we would be connected to one of the largest underwater fiber-optic highways in the world very close (and connecting Europe with Asia).  And taking into account that only a minimal number of people will use this channel here, we will get one of the fastest Internet sites on the planet here. <br>  In this context, it became quite obvious to me the opportunity to try to create a training program here, as well as an outsourced office, aimed at Software Engineering, as they say in the west.  In short, code - and teach this pirates. <br>  I am aware of how crazy it sounds, and I would not be surprised if many of you do not believe me.  But I am speaking quite seriously. <br><a name="habracut"></a>

      What is the idea in general terms: <br><br>  <b>Organization</b> <br>  With an existing university, a new curriculum will be created - BA in Software Engineering, which, more than half, will be devoted to the study of programming languages ‚Äã‚Äãunder the guidance of several white experienced programmers. <br>  When it is (by white coders), a software office will be created that focuses on outsourcing (although a local market will also appear - both business and the government need some kind of software, but they need it).  So, instead of paying for tuition (or part of it), as well as for practice, students will also have to work out in this office after class. <br>  As a result, white coders will have to teach about 12-16 hours a week, but they will receive for this - free labor, the quality of which will depend solely on the effort invested in it.  Black slaves, in short. <br><br>  <b>Studying proccess</b> <br>  The local system of secondary education is very poorly developed, therefore in the beginning they will have a very low level of mathematics and will have to pay much attention to it, as well as English.  To the point that we will force very weak students to go through a preparatory year of intensive mathematics and English. <br>  When it comes to, in fact, computers, the program will be aimed at Linux and Open Source - accordingly, attention will also need to be paid to the architecture of these systems. <br>  As for languages, in fact, we want to teach both low- and high-level: C, C ++, Python, Java, Erlang, LISP, ML, PHP, Ruby.  Object-oriented or not - do not know yet. <br>  We plan a total of 3 years for the program (plus, who needs it, preparatory);  since, in contrast to universities in developed countries, we will not have auxiliary subjects (except English and mathematics), we should probably get away with: about 18 class hours a week, about half of which (and in senior courses - in general 10-12 hours) will go to the computer business and coding. <br>  Yes, and we will provide them with computers around the clock access, if that, so there will be no problems with it. <br><br>  That's about everything about it and I wanted to hear the opinion of Habr: <br>  What to teach to make coders from illiterate Negroes?  (considering that through tough selection we can really gather the best minds of the nation, since the organization already has a solid reputation as a leader in the educational sphere). <br>  What are the languages ‚Äã‚Äãin the subject now, in order to find a job and are not quite so complex? <br>  How to teach them?  Object oriented or not?  What kind of approach should be? <br>  What tool to use? <br><br>  Well, and if someone wants to take part and directly participate (you never know in whom the unsatisfied call of adventure), then I will be more than happy!  The information further is for you. <br><br>  My personal goal here is to do something good and creative in this country, so I‚Äôll say right away that I personally don‚Äôt care about the commercial success of the project.  However, it is clear that in order to attract people to it, I should be interested in them, including financially, so I will sign for the idea in more detail. <br><br>  <b>Logistics</b> <br>  All this will be part of a large and serious organization called <a href="http://abaarsotech.org/">Abaarso Tech</a> .  These are children of a banker from Wall Street, who is tired of everything and he decided to invest all his money in creating a world-class boarding school in the most dysfunctional country in the world, which he did, having moved here for good.  It went well, and over time the project grew and began to include not only the school, but also the university and other educational programs.  We will be one more. <br>  Naturally, for many at once there is a security issue.  And although Somalia is really the largest Failed State on the planet, has not seen any government for 20 years, Somaliland is a safe and secure enclave.  In the same AT - almost all teachers - Americans or Europeans, and nothing. <br>  For the money: AT will pay, like all its teachers - it will provide transport, housing, food, and in general all that will need to be here + 250 bucks a month (which, in fact, will have to spend just physically nothing).  But besides this, there will also be a share in the office, which even from small projects should, in theory, bring a normal profit: since you don‚Äôt have to spend a single penny on the infrastructure, or on the workforce, and the whole budget will be a profit.  In addition, no one will disturb you remotely. <br><br>  But from my own experience, I guarantee you that seeing how your work for the better changes the lives of people around you is worth more than any money. <br><br>  <b>Update:</b> <br>  Friends!  Thank you all for the violent reaction, I did not expect this. <br>  Especially - for the advice and opinions (even pessimistic).  For the sake of collecting them, I did the post. <br><br>  Also, suddenly a lot of people showed interest in coming here.  The fact is that the organization is large and people need not only specialized IT specialists - therefore, whatever you do, throw your resume at aeroclub.ep at gimmeil. <br><br>  Thank! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/122977/">https://habr.com/ru/post/122977/</a></p>
