    <a name="habracut"></a><br>  He, as I was convinced from my own experience, is quite fair. <br>  It is reinforced by one of the mottos of the game - ‚ÄúLosing is fun!‚Äù (‚ÄúLosing is fun‚Äù). <br><br>  Two brothers - Zach Adams (ThreeToe) and Tarn Adams (Toady One) (they also Bay12games) began to develop this game in 2002.  In 2006, the first release took place.  Now the game is still in the alpha version stage, but, you know, everyone would have alpha versions like this game. <br><br>  First you will need to create a world in which you will settle your dwarves.  The world is generated randomly, but very seriously - the computer will sift out unfit options for life before it does not create the right one.  Then life will begin on the created territory - rivers and lakes will dry up, new civilizations will appear and old ones will die - all this before a player appears in this world.  Later, when we will choose a place for our fortress, we will have to pay attention to our neighbors, the climate, the location of rivers and lakes, the height of the mountains, the minerals presented. <br><br>  When the world is created, we can go explore it by selecting one of the modes offered: in the Dwarf Fortress mode, we have to build and ensure the well-being of the fortress city of dwarves.  In Adventurer mode, we will be able to go to one of the worlds we have created as an adventurer (this mode will remind you of rougelike games).  Later, the ‚ÄúReclaim fortress‚Äù section may appear - so you can bring back the fortress that the villains captured by equipping an expedition of warrior dwarves. <br><br>  When you are trying to describe the fortress mode in the game Dwarf Fortress, you perforce mention such games as Dungeon Keeper and Settlers.  From the first, first of all, the concept of creating dungeons, rooms.  From the second game - the chain of production.  For example, to create a bedroom for your dwarves, you will have to send a lumberjack to mine wood, build a carpenter's workshop, make beds there, dig a room for the bedroom, place the beds there, and only then assign it the ‚Äúplace‚Äù where your dwarves can rest. <br><br>  Virtually all other actions in the game are also neatly connected with each other, so get ready to frequently use the manuals and tips.  You can find them primarily on the pages of the <a href="http://www.dwarffortresswiki.net/">Dwar Fortress Wiki</a> and on the pages of the <a href="http://www.dfwk.ru/">Russian version of dwarfopedia</a> .  I confess that when I first started playing, I could not even begin to dig a dungeon.  I was greatly helped by the <a href="http://www.bay12games.com/forum/index.php%3Ftopic%3D28477.0">video tutorials</a> that the Dutch lad prepared under the nickname captain_duck prepared.  Tell me, have you ever turned to video lessons to understand a computer game ?:) First of all, they will help you understand the management and interface of the game. <br><br>  Speaking of the interface!  Toady One says, "The interface is coming - it's not coming in your lifetime, but it's coming."  And I still have not shown you a screenshot of the game.  So here's an example: <br><br><img src="http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/screens/meeting_hall.PNG" alt="image"><br><br>  Exactly, in the best traditions of (quite) the old school, the standard build game looks. <br>  Green grass on the left, dwarves in the center with symbolic attractive faces smile, rocks on the right. <br><br>  But do not worry - you can make the game a little more attractive visually, using all sorts of tilesets. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/95c/eee/968/95ceee96804d0a72ad00384913d20291.png" alt="image"><br>  For example <a href="http://mayday.w.staszic.waw.pl/df.php">Mike Mayday Graphics Edition</a> . <br>  Or choose something on <a href="http://www.dwarffortresswiki.net/index.php/Graphics">this page</a> . <br><br>  Despite the rustic appearance, the game is quite demanding of resources - initially it takes about 20 megabytes of the game, but then the game folder can take up 100, and from whom for 1000 megabytes.  The more dwarves will be, the stronger will be the load on the processor, the game also eats the RAM rather readily.  Be ready for this. <br><br>  The game is available for users of Windows, Linux and Mac OS, so that no one will leave offended. <br><br><h4>  Windows: </h4><br>  <a href="">Download the</a> classic version from the developers site <br>  <a href="http://www.dfwk.ru/index.php/%25D0%2593%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D1%2584%25D0%25B8%25D1%2587%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F">Select the</a> graphic version in the Russian wiki dwarf. <br><br><h4>  Mac: </h4><br>  <a href="">Download</a> Mac version from the developers site <br><br><h4>  Linux: </h4><br>  <a href="">Download the</a> Linux version from the developers site. <br>  <a href="">Download</a> graphic build for Linux from Russian wiki dwarf. <br><br>  + <br><br>  <a href="http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/index.html">Home page of the</a> game on the site <a href="http://www.bay12games.com/">Bay12games</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/68968/">https://habr.com/ru/post/68968/</a></p>
