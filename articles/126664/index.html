    <h5>  The main question is why? </h5><br>  Yes, a lot of copies broken on whether to pass certification.  Many in general are against any examinations and beautiful paperwork certificates, many people are amused by the phrase "php programmer", for them there are only php-cattle coders, imagine how they are amused to the phrase "php certification" in their stomachs!  I will not consider such extreme cases, I will just mention my simple reasons why I went to take the exam: <br><ul><li>  to get a job abroad (abroad, not in ex-USSR) </li><li>  see if I can pass it, a kind of challenge </li><li>  put a kind of label that I know php at this level, now you can make the main language of Java, or ABAP, or switch to development for mobile platforms </li></ul><br><h5>  Training </h5><br>  I first thought about certification in 2009 after this topic <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/php/61215/">habrahabr.ru/blogs/php/61215</a> , read in the internet that the only international certification is Zend.  I even found the Zend sertification study guide 2nd edition on the Internet, I started reading at my leisure, but then a lot of work was just unrealistic, it was not up to it.  But in practice I managed to touch on what was written in the manual.  Then I remembered the certification at the beginning of this year, I started reading the theory in parallel with my work: <br><ul><li>  "Professional PHP Programming" George Schlossnagle </li><li>  "PHP and MySQL Web Development" Luke Welling, Laura Thomson </li><li>  "PHP: Objects, Patterns and Programming Techniques" by Matt Zandstra </li><li>  "PHP 5. Professional Programming" E. Gutmans, Bakken S., Retans D. </li><li>  <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/">www.php.net/manual/en</a> </li></ul><br>  In fact, basically it was not the development of new information, but the structuring of information obtained in practice in the brain, and the completion of some white spots. <br><br>  On Habr√©, Zend certification has already been discussed in some way in the following topics: <br><ul><li>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/php/61215/">habrahabr.ru/blogs/php/61215</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/qa/3716/">habrahabr.ru/qa/3716</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/php/117688/">habrahabr.ru/blogs/php/117688</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/php/20479/">habrahabr.ru/blogs/php/20479</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/personal/50079/">habrahabr.ru/blogs/personal/50079</a> </li></ul><br>  In fact, of course, my training did not last for two years, sometimes there were months, during which I did not touch the books and did not learn anything new for the exam, I just worked, wrote my projects, generally lived an ordinary razdolbayskaya life) <br><br>  It was so until the beginning of this August, when I said to myself ‚Äúenough‚Äù and right there I planned the exam for the 19th day.  By the way, I want to talk about one interesting thing, I registered on the site from work, from there I put an order for a voucher and trial tests in the basket, but then I decided to pay from home and for some reason I cleared the basket.  I came home in the evening and found in the mail a letter from zend of something like this: ‚ÄúWe noticed that you wanted to order an exam, but then you cleared the basket.  What drives you?  Maybe a high price?  Here's the code for a 5 percent discount. ‚Äù  So I paid for the exam from home at a discount) And then I found out that the exam was no longer in version 5, but in 5.3.  That exam topics have changed, but it was good for me, because I studied 5.3 in depth in connection with one project. <br><br>  So, the last two weeks before the exam flew by unnoticed, I downloaded the study guide from <a href="http://www.zend.com/en/download/487">www.zend.com/en/download/487</a> (need to register for the jump) and protruded 10 exam topics from the guide, flipping through the books, my notes, looking at the documentation for finding out any hidden nuances. <br><br><h5>  Exam </h5><br>  Before the exam, I was even worried somehow, but the first question about DateTime relaxed me, because I actively used this class in one project and studied it far and wide. During the exam I did not notice the trick questions that were discussed in other topics, such as missed commas, function names with numbers, etc.  There were specific knowledge questions, it seems to me that some questions can be answered only by having practice, one theory will not go far.  I came across 3 or 4 questions about downloading files, I was still surprised that the questions are from one area.  There were no questions on design patterns.  There were questions about closures.  As a result, I did not answer 4 questions out of 70. Then I returned to them, put it at random.  I ran through the issues noted for further verification and clicked the ‚ÄúEnd Exam‚Äù button.  Time spent about an hour, although put 90 minutes.  To be honest, I even had some kind of fear before pressing, but I quickly jabbed the mouse and here it was ‚ÄúExam results: PASS‚Äù.  Well, in principle, that's all, since the exam was at lunchtime, I went to work further) <br><br><h5>  Results </h5><br>  What are the results?  I have a certificate which, if it does not help me in looking for work abroad, at least will make it easier.  In our country, I don‚Äôt think it will be very useful, because I didn‚Äôt even get any feedback from my colleagues.  But besides the certificate, I have a layer of theoretical and practical skills. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/126664/">https://habr.com/ru/post/126664/</a></p>
