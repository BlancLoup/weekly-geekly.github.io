  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Mobile games that help us stay healthy</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Mobile video games, which were originally intended to entertain, have recently headed for health.  First came the iPhone app that helps quit smoking.  Then came Tetris, which serves as an alternative way to find a cure for AIDS and cancer.  And these are just a few examples of how the development of the video game industry is affecting health education. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Anatomylab</b> <br>  This iPhone application is a more realistic version of the Operation board game.  You can open, examine and study the human body with all its internal organs with a slight movement of your finger.  This game was developed by researchers from the University of Utah, anatomically flawless, as it was drawn from a real human corpse. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/777/55c/6e3/77755c6e3a3142d5ad5c278b04609dc8.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Beating heart</b> <br>  A prototype of this game was demonstrated at last year's Body Computing Conference at the University of Southern California.  With the help of this iPhone application you can remotely monitor your heart rate, and even add this data to your Facebook and Twitter page.  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãsuch a game belongs to Dr. Leslie Saxon, who in such a fascinating way seeks to involve the modern youth in control over their own body.

Purchase LIT is not yet possible.  It is known that the game is built on the principle of ‚Äúsubstitution therapy‚Äù and allows the smoker to deeply feel the sensations of the body caused by smoking.  The game is being developed by specialists at Columbia University College of Education.  Funds she development LIT in the amount of $ 150000 allocated the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b20/60a/74b/b2060a74bb0dc88536a9d88689166a52.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Re-Mission: shoot cancer cells</b> <br>  It is hard to believe that a video shooter can be of great help to children in their fight against cancer.  However, as it turned out, this is possible.  The developer of the game Re-Misson - HopeLab - proved that the fear of the disease can be overcome.  This game is a shooter, the goal of which is to shoot cancer cells.  The first tests have already shown excellent results: cancer patients who played in the Re-Mission changed their attitude towards the disease.  They have begun to take antibiotics more consciously and are more comfortable with chemotherapy.  The game also helps all people learn more about this disease and about the processes occurring in the human body.  The development of the Re-Mission is sponsored by Pam Omidar, the wife of the founder of eBay. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/687/efe/2d7/687efe2d71d28e17d8d4be93f63b34bb.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Foldit</b> <br>  This puzzle game is different from the usual "Tetris", for which we once irrevocably spent their precious hours.  Foldit is a three-dimensional computer game developed by researchers from the University of Washington.  In the game you control the chains of amino acids, squeezing and turning them.  Thus, the players in the process of the game help in the formation of new protein forms that can help in the development of drugs for diseases such as AIDS and cancer.  The game is available for free download on the Internet. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/cb0/794/c9e/cb0794c9e7daca337b5298da0bdbcda5.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Immune attack</b> <br>  You can literally fight the infection in the literal sense: by using a nanobot through the blood vessels and connective tissues inside the human body.  This 3D adventure game was developed by the Federation of American Scientists to introduce university students to subjects such as cell biology and molecular science.  The game is available for free download on the Internet. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bd6/0a6/b53/bd60a6b53de82957af687d43518112c3.jpg" alt="image"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/82960/">https://habr.com/ru/post/82960/</a></p>
