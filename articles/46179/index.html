This item is the authors specifically left in the structure.  The fact is that to continue the work you need to be sure that the work you are doing will not fall into the basket.  Therefore, at the task clarification stage, two things need to be done: <br><ul><li>  establish yourself with previously assigned tasks </li><li>  identify minor tasks that are not the most important for the project, but are pursued by the client </li></ul><br>  This is advisable to do at a meeting and additionally backed up by e-mail. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h3>  Timing </h3><br>  This is an important stage in communicating with the client.  Here it is important not only to find out the deadline for the completion of the project, but also to determine the intermediate deadlines for approving the project documentation. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      In addition, the manager must arrange together with the client priorities in the launch of the project, discuss force majeure and ways to solve problems with deadlines.  Ask a question why are the project launch dates.  This is always true for complex projects and for small jobs. <br><br><h3>  Definition of work patterns </h3><br>  This stage of communication concerns two things: <br><ul><li>  stages of the project </li><li>  stages of project financing </li></ul><br>  Remember that in Russia most of the agencies work differently and the client might already have an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe progress of the work.  With this presentation, he turns to you.  Therefore, you need, without hurting the mind of the client, to explain to him how you are working on the tasks set and at what points the client will make decisions. <br>  It is equally important to discuss the stages of financing before entering into an agreement.  From what project you take into your own hands, you can decide for yourself how it will be most profitable for you to work.  Operate at this stage will have percentages. <br><br>  At this stage of communication, you can approve the cost of pre-project work on the site and the terms of payment for this part of the work. <br><br><h3>  Discussion of performance evaluation criteria </h3><br>  A difficult moment in the process of working with a client is determining the quality of work performed.  It is difficult to give any advice here, but it is possible to sanctify the principles and approaches to discussing these issues. <br><br>  Quite a large part of the work of the agency (design studio, a group of freelancers) refers to the subjective part of perception.  These are ideas and design.  All other processes are amenable to regulation and description at the design stage of the promotional site. <br><br>  The very creation of this material on the development of promotional sites was the result of disagreements and a large number of discussions with clients about the work.  The scheme we are considering is intended to serve as an understandable mechanism for product development.  If each of the stages of this scheme is done responsibly and conscientiously, then, most likely, problems in the work should not arise.  At first glance, the frightening number of steps makes it possible to understand where a mistake can be and to avoid its appearance. <br><br>  In order to determine whether the ideas correspond to the task, you need in the process of creating them all the time to contact the brief and justify your steps. <br><br>  Design quality is the subject of individual articles and research.  Again, if the client is armed with an understanding of the site creation process and sees a portfolio, sketches and references, then the possibility of design rejection decreases.  But still the chance that the client will not accept the design in the further development remains.  Therefore, at the stage of discussion of the work criteria, it is necessary to determine the framework within which the client can act.  The easiest way is to pay for every new design development. <br><br>  When discussing design evaluation criteria, it is necessary to clearly define areas of responsibility.  Subjective assessments of colors, techniques and effects in design leave it to the designers, and the client should approach the question of design whether he fulfills his role or not.  If not, why not.  Be sure to arrange to fix all comments on the design. <br><br>  If you can not boast of a large number of works in the portfolio, then nevertheless do not be afraid to decide on the cost of each new design (free layouts should also be discussed).  Remember that during the pre-project preparation, you will provide the client with a verbalized idea in sketches and additional materials.  This may then help not to intervene meticulously with the client in the development of the final layouts. <br><br>  In any case, this is an important conversation with the client, which should appeal to a reasonable approach to work and positive communication in order to find compromises that benefit both parties. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/46179/">https://habr.com/ru/post/46179/</a></p>
