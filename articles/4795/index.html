  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Google officially launches AdWords in the Russian market</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Today at a press conference in Moscow, <a href="http://www.google.ru/">Google</a> announced the official launch of the <a href="https://adwords.google.com/select/main%3Fcmd%3DLogin%26sourceid%3DAWO%26subid%3DUS-ET-ADS%26hl%3Dru">Google AdWords</a> search advertising system in Russia. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Following the strategy of localizing its services for Russia and striving to create the most favorable conditions for advertisers, Google offers the possibility of paying for contextual advertising with Google AdWords by bank transfer, the most common form of payment in Russia. <br><br>  Another advantage of AdWords is the availability of effective free tools for managing an online advertising campaign and analyzing its effectiveness: Google Analytics and Ad Scheduling, which are closely integrated with AdWords. <br><br>  ‚ÄúWe chose Google AdWords because of the breadth of coverage and the opportunity to establish contact with potential customers both in RuNet and beyond,‚Äù says Vladislav Ulendeev, chairman of the board of directors of eHouse, a Google advertiser.  - Contextual advertising is a high-precision tool that allows us to address only ‚Äúour‚Äù potential consumers.  This distinguishes it from advertising in traditional media, the purpose of which is to reach the maximum possible audience;  it is not addressed specifically to "our" consumer.  The high accuracy of Google AdWords provides us with a higher CTR and ROI compared to other types of advertising. ‚Äù

      ‚ÄúThanks to the specialized Google services, we were able to significantly improve the effectiveness of the campaign,‚Äù said Mikhail Penkovsky, commercial director of Agnitum Ltd.  - With Google Analytics, we selected the optimal keywords and set the cost per click, with Ad Scheduling analyzed the behavior of our customers, the best time to show.  With the launch of the advertising campaign on Google, the growth in sales of our online store was 30%, and each dollar invested brought in $ 2.4 of net profit, ‚Äùadded Mikhail. <br><br>  According to the Association of Communication Agencies of Russia, in 2005, Russian advertisers spent on contextual advertising $ 40 million. This market is growing very rapidly, so there‚Äôs probably no special competition between Google AdWords, Yandex.Direct and other similar systems in Runet. will be. <br><br>  For today's marketing campaign of the Russian division of Google, competitors were rather skeptical.  That's what <b>Elena Kolmanovskaya</b> , the chief editor of Yandex, told us. <br><br><blockquote>  From the press releases it is not entirely clear what is the novelty, that is, what happened exactly today.  The AdWords system has been around for a long time, Russified (like many other Google services) and accepts Russian-language advertising.  All that is listed is not a new phenomenon in the Russian market.  The two main systems of contextual advertising placement, Yandex.Direct (advertising is placed on Yandex and Mail.ru) and Runner (advertising is placed on Rambler as well), have long and successfully promoted to the masses contextual advertising, conduct seminars, certify specialists. <br><br>  AdWords has been around for many years, and it has been Russified for a long time, and the problem there is not in the interface, but in a not very large share of Google on the Russian market and not a very convenient payment.  Judging by the press release, they started accepting bank transfers - I wonder which country?  If in the USA, then I suppose there is currency control, and the transfer takes a long time.  In Russia, Yandex.Money and Webmoney work well. </blockquote><br><br>  The chief editor of Yandex agrees that there will not be much competition in the near future between Direkt, Runner and AdWords.  There is plenty of room for everyone: ‚ÄúI believe that today's releases of the well-known American company Google will attract additional attention to the rapidly growing contextual advertising market (there is no prophet in his own country), which will help him grow even faster.  There is always a demand for high-quality sites and it only increases with time, ‚Äùsaid Elena Kolmanovskaya. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/4795/">https://habr.com/ru/post/4795/</a></p>
