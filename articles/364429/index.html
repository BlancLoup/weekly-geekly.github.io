  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How did we earn 1 million rubles in December, or Where to buy advertising on the Internet so that it would not be excruciatingly painful?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In September 2013, the crowdfunding project for the children's scientific book ‚ÄúSimple Science‚Äù was successfully completed, one of whose authors I am.  Almost 900 people decided that such a book is needed and that it should be released.  And to transform ideas into matter, these people invested more than 800 thousand rubles.  Shortly before the onset of 2014, the book had already been printed - the lacquered cover gleamed solidly, the smooth pages pleasantly stroked the fingers, and the smell of printing ink filled the cup of happiness to the brim.  It was an indescribable pleasant feeling that a very important thing had been done.  But behind all this lyrics was followed by a quite prosaic question: what to do with 5 thousand children's books - our first edition?  We thought about conducting an online advertising campaign.  How successful was she?  I can brag: for the outgoing 2014, we have already released three volumes of ‚ÄúSimple Science‚Äù, printed additional editions of the first and second volumes, and the total number of books sold exceeded 15 thousand.  And all these sales are exclusively via the Internet. <br><br>  Our second achievement is the information explosion on the fairly well-known resource Adme.ru.  Below you can see a preliminary table, where the sites used by us are reflected and it can be seen how effective they are.  I will make a reservation right away: according to Adme, data are given after the initial placement.  And this failure transformed into a sensation. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/db9/ca8/096/db9ca8096a2d5364f8a698af9667a21f.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  <b>Instead of introducing</b> </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2ad/bbc/866/2adbbc8668e28ac8b9dea22ad1887315.jpg" alt="image">

      After printing the first edition, we had an obvious task: to promote the product and select the most effective distribution channels for this.  Taking into account that our project was born and is developing on the Internet ( <a href="http://simplescience.ru/books/">website</a> , <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/GTVscience/">YouTube channel</a> , groups in various social networks, there was once a company blog on Habr√©) it is logical to use virtual space as the main distribution site.  Information about our book appeared in all of our resources: <br><br>  - on the YouTube channel, information about the book is embedded in all the videos; <br>  - in groups VK and FB, a site with a book was added to the links; <br>  - on Habr√© published and turns, and information about the collection of money for the project, and much more; <br>  - we met with many authors of crowd-projects, which informationally supported our initiative. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c17/65e/1c5/c1765e1c53fa722bd0190af9bb8978ae.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  However, in January 2014 it became clear that this was not enough.  We went beyond the limits of the virtual space: books appeared in the largest bookstores (Biblio-Globus, Molodaya Gvardiya, TD Moskva) and we discovered the direction of work with joint purchases.  Who does not know what a joint venture is, I say at once: you lose a lot in terms of developing your business.  From April 22 to December 20, 2014, we sold 5765 books through the joint venture - thanks to this channel, books appeared in all parts of Russia: not only in large, but even in remote villages and villages (provided that there is Internet).  We sold another 1000 books through the tender system - our book was chosen by a well-known Russian oil company as an integral part of a corporate children's gift. <br>  As for offline sales in chain stores, you can get there only through distributors.  They have very unfavorable conditions and a strange attitude towards work.  Therefore, if any of you have a small shop and you want to sell our books, please contact us.  Or if you are a responsible distributor, we are also glad to cooperate! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/69f/441/99b/69f44199b1b5462604f5c768df1d1d39.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  But the topic of today's material, I still want to make the development of an effective advertising campaign on the Internet.  During the year we tried a lot on a variety of resources, and we had the most important thing: experience.  And also subjective (own impressions) and objective (figures) results of the publication of advertising on these resources. <br><br>  I would also like to note that not so long ago a preliminary version of this material was <a href="http://siliconrus.com/2014/12/effective-ads/">published</a> on the Internet, thanks to which it became possible to write this post.  So I can, with a clear conscience, express my gratitude to the publication of the ‚ÄúCP‚Äù and personally to one of its editors: first, that they had such a resonant media.  Secondly, they always tried to meet us in the preparation of the material. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/12c/0ac/3b9/12c0ac3b98b1c5e912bbff36b5cbee4b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h5>  <b>From small to large</b> </h5><br>  I have prepared a small information table reflecting our search for the perfect price-quality Internet site.  The table shows all the resources where we paid advertising.  But before that I want to give my own brief information on each of them.  Obviously, on some of these sites you can advertise not only children's books, but also many other things - not necessarily even a segment of children's products. <br><br><h6>  <i>Siberian family site Sibmama (sibmama.ru)</i> </h6><br>  <a href="http://sibmama.ru/index.php%3Fp%3Dprostaja-nauka%26sid%3De68ace440334330767ef61338f5a4df6">Link</a> to remote post (registered users only) <br>  The largest resource for mummies in the region of Siberia.  There are also larger ones for the whole of Russia, but their advertising prices are measured from 100 thousand rubles.  The conditions of "Sibmamy" are more acceptable. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d45/7b0/322/d457b0322eab14f6fa088a070d6e383f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  But there are a few drawbacks.  First, only registered users can see the post.  Secondly, the topic is added to the forum (it is redirected from the site, and comments are received not under the material, but on the forum).  Thirdly, the post after a while is deleted, and not stored in the annals of the site.  Fourth, it is very difficult to ‚Äúget through‚Äù to the administration.  That is, you want to pay them money for advertising, but they do not even respond to your application. <br>  As a result: we agreed with the administration of the site for a long time and very difficult, but the expectations from the publication did not completely justify ourselves.  It should be borne in mind that the admins are the same moms that sit on the site.  I do not hint at anything, but who has already had experience of communicating on working topics with mothers with young children, can understand me. <br><br>  <u>Pros:</u> <br>  - The largest resource for moms in Siberia. <br>  - materials are available only to registered users of the resource. <br><br>  <u>Minuses:</u> <br>  - minimal short-term effect; <br>  - the post does not go to the archive, but is deleted. <br><br><h6>  <i>Trinixy (trinixy.ru)</i> </h6><br>  <a href="http://trinixy.ru/99841-prostaya-nauka-kniga-dlya-lyuboznatelnyh-detey-i-ih-roditeley.html">Our post</a> <br>  One of the largest entertainment resources Runet.  Here, if admins are to be believed, not only schoolchildren live, but also serious people, who in our case are potential buyers.  Our advertising campaign failed: either the product did not fit, or the characteristic of visitors to the resource is not entirely objective. <br>  Impressions of communicating with admins, by the way, are the most beautiful!  Adequate and very operational.  The cost of advertising depends on the placement in the news feed (the higher - the more expensive). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/084/aef/ae3/084aefae32041644031263d47019ceae.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <u>Pros:</u> <br>  - excellent communication with resource administrators. <br><br>  <u>Minuses:</u> <br>  - low return. <br><br><h6>  <i>World of Facts (mirfactov.com)</i> </h6><br>  <a href="http://mirfactov.com/prostaya-nauka-kniga-dlya-lyuboznatelnyih-detey-i-ih-roditeley/">Our post</a> <br>  Specialized scientific and educational resource.  In addition to the site, our material got into his social network.  However, as it turned out, people come to this site more likely to relax and learn something new and interesting, and not to make purchases. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6e8/1d6/372/6e81d6372808cb7159d680229a265186.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <u>Pros:</u> <br>  - the material is given not only on the site, but also on the social network. <br><br>  <u>Minuses:</u> <br>  - low return. <br><br><h6>  <i>Picabu (pikabu.ru)</i> </h6><br>  <a href="http://pikabu.ru/story/kniga_kotoraya_pomozhet_polyubit_nauku_2501945">Our post</a> <br>  One of the largest entertainment resources, a source of jokes and news for all Internet publics - scientific, scandalous, vanilla and so on.  Previously, the resource had more ‚Äúmature‚Äù people (in terms of age and mentality), now schoolchildren rule there.  This is fully reflected in the content, perception of news and advertising.  That is, according to logic, to advertise games, consoles, phones for young people here can and should be.  And the advertising of children's books, as our experience has shown, is not very promising.  But the results of successful advertisements get out of this logic.  For example, advertising service business card production has shown excellent results.  So predict after that ... In other words, the success of advertising depends on the product.  But if the product for Picabu is new, it is very difficult to predict the success of its advertising. <br>  It should be noted colossal human resources "Peekaboo."  You may not work advertising, but if your post is interesting, informative, then you will increase the visibility of your product / project.  And this, ultimately, your potential sales. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ff2/bd6/e5b/ff2bd6e5b2f2332bc5a16c70a6f1e530.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  How to make advertising shoot?  Create a new ma'am or revive the old one.  And on the "Picaba" love cats.  And girls.  Seriously, if there are cats and girls in your ad, success is guaranteed.  But not sales. <br><br>  Please note that if you have a poor-quality product, they will definitely tell about it in the comments.  So you don't even need to try to offer any nonsense! <br><br>  And one more thing - on ‚ÄúPicaba‚Äù a very adequate and friendly admin, Maxim from Moscow, who really loves his site and does not ‚Äústar‚Äù.  He told me that the site does not consider the number of views of an advertising post (after all, the post can be viewed in the tape, they can go into the comments).  But, on average, the number of views of advertising when placing a day - <i>about 650 thousand.</i>  Colossal number, right? <br><br>  If you are interested in more detailed information about the number of visitors, then here it is, closed to ordinary users information: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/59d/ac7/eb3/59dac7eb3fd8eff990432bd4f0d330f1.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The site also has a rating system for users (both news and comments are evaluated), and each new ‚Äúlevel‚Äù opens up new possibilities for submitting material: <br>  -200 Your account is automatically blocked. <br>  -25 You can not add comments <br>  0 Your rating at registration <br>  +10 you can attach a picture to the comment <br>  250 can add video <br>  +1000 can add link <br><br>  The founder of "Picabu" also commented on our material on the "CPU".  And many users of the same resource agreed with his comments. <br><br><img src="http://[url=https://fotki.yandex.ru/users/avtor86/view/983866?p=1][img]https://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/15556/25453424.b/0_f033a_b9f57dd0_orig.jpg[/img][/url]" alt="image"><br><br>  And now - attention.  Information current at the end of December 2014.  Advertising post on "Picabu" is fixed at the very top of the resource and is visible to all visitors (which is beneficial to advertisers).  These advertising post can comment on all visitors of the resource (which is not very profitable for advertisers).  According to the advertisement, if it revolts the calmness of ‚ÄúPikabu‚Äù, the users themselves can make a separate post (they say, ‚Äúwhat a damn thing they give us here!‚Äù, ‚ÄúThis is deception, do not be fooled,‚Äù and so on).  If you believe Ivan Lee, the forefather of PR and Rockefeller PR, let your company speak badly better than they don‚Äôt say anything.  But, in my opinion, in the case of ‚ÄúPicaba‚Äù it‚Äôs better not to say anything about you.  And you will not wash. <br><br>  So, in the end of December, a post appeared on Picaba with an advertisement for a watch shop, filed in the spirit of the posts of the legendary person for the resource with the nickname Oblomoff.  This character is famous for its culinary posts, seasoned with photos, irony, cats, dogs and unicorns.  Not in the sense of - dishes from them, but in the sense in the design of the post they are present.  So, this forgery rebelled "Picaba", the admin had to come up with comments, the resource was remembered by the advertisement of credit card knives at a price several times higher than on ebay, many other advertising "jambs". <br><br>  My personal opinion - if the advertisement does not violate the current legislation, you can advertise anything.  And the resource and its employees also need to live on something and eat something.  But, as I have already noted, the admin "Picabu" sincerely loves his resource, so the requirements for advertisers and their products in the future will necessarily be tightened.  Consider this, potential advertisers! <br><br>  <u>Pros:</u> <br>  - entertainment resource with enormous human resources. <br><br>  <u>Minuses:</u> <br>  - It is difficult to predict the success of the campaign. <br><br><h6>  <i>Yaplakal (www.yaplakal.com)</i> </h6><br>  <a href="http://www.yaplakal.com/forum16/topic783615.html">Our post</a> <br>  Another major entertainment resource, from Picabu, is favorably distinguished by a more mature public, who may well buy an interesting product.  The cost of the post depends on the place in the news feed (by default, the price per day of posting).  The admin for Valery‚Äôs ad is very adequate and will indicate an error (actual or spelling) that will definitely show up in your advertising post.  In short, it does not just copy-paste texts and pictures, but reads the submitted material and gives practical advice on how to make your advertising more effective.  This is an excellent example when the advertising platform is interested in the advertiser to be satisfied. <br><br>  The very presentation of the promotional offer is very interesting - a pink elephant stands on Valeria's avatar.  And all advertisers are offered ‚Äúbuy an elephant.‚Äù  Remember this famous childhood ‚Äúeveryone says / does and you buy an elephant‚Äù?  I remember getting this joke specifically. <br><br>  Important!  If you have a poor-quality product, they will definitely tell about it in the comments.  So you don't even have to offer any nonsense!  However, both comments and evaluation of your advertising post can be disabled.  In general, an advertising post can be customized as if it is a user.  And hidden advertising is always more effective. <br><br>  If anyone is interested, you can get acquainted with the tariffs of YAP <a href="http://www.yaplakal.com/adv/">here</a> .  We usually choose the fifth position in the tape, it costs 20 thousand rubles.  There is a discount for the first placement, there are discounts for the permanent placement or if you pay for 3-4 accommodations immediately or within a month. <br><br>  And <a href="http://alpha.yaplakal.com/cpyap/booking/">here</a> is an interactive calendar for occupied / free advertising spaces.  Very handy thing, by the way.  Since, firstly, you can book in advance.  Secondly, if you suddenly decide to advertise, you can see how much it is on the site that day.  It seems to me that the less advertising is simultaneously placed, the higher the effectiveness of the submitted appeals. <br><br>  At our request, the Administration of ‚ÄúYAP‚Äù told about how it sees Internet advertising in 2015 and what place it will be allotted to ‚ÄúYaplakal‚Äù itself. <br><br><blockquote>  The advertising market on the Internet will continue to grow, although not as rapidly as in 2014. This year, YaPlakal site celebrated its 10th anniversary, and this is not the first crisis in our memory.  Even in the winter of 2009, in the midst of the past crisis, the site did not stand idle without advertising, budgets overflowed: someone chose more profitable tools, moving from top sites like Yandex and Meil.ru, someone redistributed the costs of television advertising to the benefit of digital tools. <br><br>  In parallel with the main site, we are also developing a social direction - PL is present in all major social networks, for example, Yaplakal on Facebook has more than 140,000 subscribers, more than in the seemingly more native social network on VKontakte.  The main advantage of such branches is the ability to provide traffic support to the main project, as well as advertising materials on it. <br><br>  In addition, we plan to actively develop the direction of branding and special projects, for this the future.  This year, special projects for Panasonic, Dozorov‚Äôs books were made, more than 80 site branding took place, and a number of new activities for major brands were planned in the new year. <br><br>  Also, a separate success of the site brought cooperation with the leading video sowing system in Runet - Vibum.  During this year, more than 3,400,000 views of commercial videos were made on the pages of Yaplakal and related projects.  The increase was more than 100% year on year.  From additional plans for the future - the launch of a mobile application (development is already underway) and the monetization of mobile traffic. </blockquote><br><br>  In my personal opinion - YP has a place to develop advertising: it's time to connect your social networks. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f11/951/ce3/f11951ce383c0eab05448f2c263c99f6.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <u>Pros:</u> <br>  - A great option to promote an interesting and high-quality product; <br>  - various options for the presentation of material (hidden advertising). <br><br>  <u>Minuses:</u> <br>  - price; <br>  - in the comments, in any case, they will troll (the high price is not made in Russia, but I just don‚Äôt like it ‚Äî anything, and all this can be in a certain obscene style). <br><br><h6>  <i>Hicktime (geektimes.ru)</i> </h6><br>  <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/gtv/blog/242446/">Sample post</a> <br>  "Daughter" or "son" Habra, which is created, it seems, as for the separation of users.  Leave IT threads on Habr√©, and everything else on Hiktime.  This statement is as true as wrong.  Many users still do not understand why they had to share, and very interesting ‚Äúnon-IT‚Äù posts appear on Habr√© today. <br><br>  The emergence of "Giktaym" was accompanied by a change in the system of charging the rating and karma of users.  What is it and what is needed - <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/info/help/karma/">study</a> on the site. <br><br>  Each company Giktaym offers a <a href="http://geektimes.ru/info/advertising/corporate/">choice of</a> one of three corporate rates for blogging your company.  Logically, without violating the rules of the site, you can write about anything.  But, for example, it is impossible to write about your bumstarter project - ‚Äúthe resource is not for beggars‚Äù.  I am such a beggar material, when we wrote about the project " <a href="https://boomstarter.ru/projects/denis_mokhov/kvantovaya_levitatsiya_nabor_dlya_opytov_so_sverhprovodnikom">Quantum Levitation</a> ", got a ban and lost a very authoritative account. <br><br>  On the other hand, if you write really interesting, useful and accessible material about your work / product, then why do you need a corporate blog and why pay a resource?  After all, this material and so will be popular. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9bf/706/6ab/9bf7066abdaa10237d49701bdc62dee0.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <u>Pros:</u> <br>  - The resource has an excellent pedigree, thanks to which both the public and the return on interesting materials is high. <br><br>  <u>Minuses:</u> <br>  - administration policy prevents companies from promoting their projects (talking about crowdfunding); <br>  - return from materials is many times less than it was on Habr√©. <br><br><h6>  <i>Habr (habrahabr.ru)</i> </h6><br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/gtv/blog/229627/">Sample post</a> <br>  Quite a long time, our company kept a corporate blog on Habr√©.  Return on publications and about the channel, and about the book has always been very high.  And the matter is not only that Habr contributed the lion's share to the fundraising for printing the book, Habr helped to find new ideas and specialists.  Habr made our company a name.  How many times did it happen when we contacted a company with a question, looking for a metal milling service or a plexiglass case.  Or, say, they wanted to buy gallium.  And they tell us - we know you from Habr!  Let's give a discount!  You guys say well done.  It's nice, take it! <br>  Sadly, but due to disagreements with the leadership of Habr, we left the resource.  We believe that we have the right to publish in the corporate blog materials about our crowd projects, and Habr is fundamentally against it.  In any case, to lift a nose and turn your back on Habr is not productive (as well as Habr behave in such a way with those who pay them, as well as with ordinary readers), so I hope this material will help to melt the ice and resume the dialogue.  Only not from the position of ‚Äúso be it‚Äù, but in a normal working way. <br><br>  Resource <a href="http://geektimes.ru/info/advertising/corporate/">offers</a> all companies three tariff plans, which are significantly higher than on Giktime.  On return from materials on Habr√© and Hiktayme, I can say that the difference in the cost of tariffs does not reflect the real picture of affairs.  If you follow the statistics, the pricing for Hiktaym should be noticeably lower. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c58/fbe/145/c58fbe145d497acb2de7aedb58217036.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <u>Pros:</u> <br>  - a unique resource; <br>  - a fantastic return in terms of sales, and in terms of recognition (if published constantly). <br><br>  <u>Minuses:</u> <br>  - principled leadership resource; <br>  - as a consequence of the first - not quite friendly policy for advertisers (owners of corporate blogs); <br>  - the motto of the resource: "crowdfunding - fight!". <br><br><h6>  <i>LiveJournal (livejournal.com)</i> </h6><br>  <a href="http://ibigdan.livejournal.com/14848477.html">Our post</a> <br>  Here you need to choose a magazine that fits the subject of the goods.

Lebedev has 350 thousand for the post, Share threw up to 80 thousand, but we were scared away by the manner of communication and the approach to advertising.

One of its founders spoke about the existing advertising offers, the specifics of the resource, the number of visitors and so on.  I have brought all actual information in the table. <br><br>  The concept of this resource is ‚Äúnews in photos‚Äù.  The site has several subsections and a rather large number of headings.  The advertising post is perfectly visible on the start page.  The cost of advertising is important to know the following.  Its standard cost is 40 thousand.  But for the first placement there is a big discount.  Further price reduction is possible and depends on the subject of advertising.  Here is how our ad <a href="http://bigpicture.ru/%3Fp%3D586502">looks</a> on the start page: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/904/f84/0a4/904f840a4b6de5038944c0748794a931.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Otherwise, as MONUMENTALLY, I can not say anything about such a flow of advertising.  However, the same ‚ÄúBigpicture‚Äù and in this case the method of submission justifies the name of the publication.  But our ad unit is surrounded by other promotional offers everywhere (I blurred them on the print screen), and on the substrate of the site - tablets ads.  Is this a good deal of advertisers?  For site owners, yes.  For visitors - no.  For advertisers - there is a desire to stand out.  If your advertisement will not look like an obvious advertisement, but will fit into the concept of the site (advertising platform), if your advertisement will bear some benefit - aesthetic, practical, informational or even economic - you will find yourself in the win.  To the credit of the Bigpicture administrators, I note that for our material they did everything to ‚Äúsell‚Äù it as profitably as possible. <br><br>  At this position - that is, on the main one - the post hangs exactly a day, and then goes to the right in the TGB (text-graphic block) - ‚Äúpick up the audience‚Äù.  There it will hang for another week, and it will look like this on the start page: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/69c/1b3/19d/69c1b319de001c67bcf9ab4b8d311d2d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In TGB there are two blocks for which several advertising messages can apply at once.  Position in TGB is included in the cost of advertising, if you buy a package, or sold separately.  It costs 50 rubles per 1000 block hits.  One advertisement announcement in TGB is shown at least 300,000 times (15 thousand rubles). <br><br>  In our case, the administration of the resource was very interesting to look at the effect of advertising books, to see its own efficiency ratio. <br><br>  <b>Well, now the most interesting: a table with numbers.</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/db9/ca8/096/db9ca8096a2d5364f8a698af9667a21f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In the table, I repeat, outdated data on Adme.  Because I want you to understand what a powerful resource it is if you can make the right advertising message.  And if you can not do anything - here, your efficiency will be approximately the same.  In Adme, by the way, they understood and are already reviewing their work with advertisers.  Therefore, such bad results, as for the first time, you should not have. <br><br>  I consider it important to clarify: <br><br>  1) In the case of Habr and Hiktime, I took a three-month tariff, took into account that we publish three posts per month and indicated in the table the cost of one such post.  For example, the tariff for Giktaym for 3 months costs 20 thousand.  We divide it into 3 months (6.6) and into 3 posts (2.2 thousand rubles per post). <br>  2) The greatest benefit (before the second publication on Adme) was brought to us by Habr (his ‚Äúold‚Äù version) and Giktaym.  Unfortunately, the users of these resources already know about our project, therefore, in the future, the efficiency ratio will decrease. <br>  3) Despite the low coefficient of YaP, this resource provides a steady influx of new customers.  Because the attendance of a resource is really large and, besides regular users, a huge number of random ones.  They will be your buyers after the publication of the next advertising post. <br>  4) Advertising on Adme with and without the participation of the editor-in-chief is two big differences.  As incomparable return on advertising without broadcasting in FB Admi and broadcast. <br><br><h6>  <i>A bit of twitter and social networks</i> </h6><br>  After the publication on the "CPU" I was approached by the owner of a twitter account ( <a href="https://twitter.com/only_fact/status/544839355765108736">only_fact</a> - 13 thousand people), who told me absolutely free of charge about our book through his accounts.  I just wanted to check how useful his resource would be in such a case.  The results are modest: there were 360 ‚Äã‚Äãclicks from the link leading to our store.  That is, every 36th follower of this Tweet clicked on it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/efb/58e/0ff/efb58e0ffb6860d94bce70f2f56bb4da.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Experts able to sell through social networks, who empathized with the money spent on Adme advertising and offered their own vision of how to effectively spend this money on the field of social networks, were brought up to discuss the material.  We agreed that after NG, they would follow specific proposals.  Their interest will be in some percentage of each sale.  Let's see what happens. <br>  In the meantime, some agreed to wait until January, others, more precisely, the other - managed to convince us of the prospects of working with social networks.  And in this direction work is already underway - the data of potential buyers is being ‚Äúcollected‚Äù, the most effective advertising is being tried.  And VK, for example, on the left, you can now see just such an advertisement: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/232/57e/a6a/23257ea6aa37f9455c016db316ffb78f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In short, the work on the sale in social networks started.  And this will be the subject of a separate material.  As well as started more targeted work in LJ (blogs moms).  If interested, I will also prepare a post on this topic.  In a word, the new 2015 has not yet arrived, but we already have enough plans! <br><br><h5>  <b>Instead of conclusion</b> </h5><br>  Unfortunately, not all resources allow you to see the number of post views.  But still the most interesting parameter is the coefficient of effectiveness of the placement of an advertising post.  I counted it as follows: the amount of money from the orders made (but not yet paid!), Appearing after the advertising post, I divided by the cost of the post itself. <br><br>  It can also be noted that sometimes the figures of the number of sales facts and the amount of revenue do not match.  This is due to the fact that at a certain point new goods items appeared in our store (for example, in December - NG is a gift, after the release of the third volume a set of three volumes and a scientific set appeared).  New items increased the store's average check.  And yet, ceteris paribus, people from some resources buy more expensive positions, and on others, it turns out, not such a solvent audience. <br><br>  The chosen comparison parameters are quite conditional and can be argued with many.  As you can argue with the paramount importance of registered or unique visitors.  In my humble opinion, users registered on the site are active users.  They do not just watch / read, but also do something, for example, comment.  Or make purchases advertised product.  But this does not mean that if they are not registered or do not comment, they will not make a purchase, no.  But it also happens that in two VC publics with the same number advertising is more expensive in the one where the audience is more active - ‚Äúlikes‚Äù, ‚Äúrepost‚Äù. <br><br>  The founder and chief editor of Adme Marat Mukhametov does not agree with my position: <br><blockquote>  Those who subscribe to our site in social networks are active.  Every day they see our posts, go to them, then go to the main page and go further along the site.  Those who just registered on the site (with us) are not active, they may not go to the site for years.  Because we register only for commenting, and the main indicator is the number of users in our social networks. </blockquote></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/364429/">https://habr.com/ru/post/364429/</a></p>
