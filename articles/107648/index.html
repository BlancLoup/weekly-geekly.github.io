  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Wikileaks have followers.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Or competitors - you can call it what you want.  So far we are talking about a single service announced for launch, which is created by former employees of Wikileaks.  As already mentioned in one of the previous articles on Habr√©, the Wikileaks project was left by a fairly large group of its employees who disagree with the current service policy practiced by the project leader, Jullian Essendzhem.  These guys are going to create a project in the image and likeness of Wikileaks, which will work according to the rules that the developers see as the only correct ones. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  The direction of the "competitor" is the same as that of its predecessor - that is, it will be published classified materials.  Until now, this has been practiced only by the Wikileaks service, which recently began to work exclusively with information relating to US military campaigns in other countries.  This resource became especially famous after the ‚Äúejection‚Äù of hundreds of thousands of classified documents about the war in Afghanistan to the Internet, where the US military forces are involved.  After that, similar documents on the war in Iraq were published. <br><br>  According to the team that previously worked with Essenge, the hasty publication of such documents could affect the disclosure of the project informants, which, of course, is very bad for those anonymous sources who donated vast arrays of classified documents.  After this whole story, US officials almost went crazy trying to show Wikileaks as the No. 1 threat to this country.

      In general, all this, including unnecessary, according to former employees, the hype, do not like most of the former Wikileaks team.  At the head of the "opposition" is a former spokesman for the project, whose name is Daniel Berg.  He and most of the Wikileaks team left the project in September of this year.  Now the guys are creating (the works are almost finished) their own project, plus they are working on creating such a technology that will be able to protect project informants from disclosure. <br><br>  Earlier, Berg criticized Wikileaks for the fact that this project began to work exclusively with projects relating to the United States, refusing to accept documents that refer to other countries.  According to Berg, this is contrary to the original plan - the publication of classified information that is illegally concealed by the authorities of various countries.  In turn, Wikileaks employees justify such a "specialization" by the fact that they physically do not have time to work through all the incoming documents, and therefore decided to work "pointwise". <br><br>  In general, a resource will soon appear on the Web, which will publish a wide range of secret documents, working along the lines of Wikileaks.  We'll see what the new project can provide, and whether it will really be of high quality.  Representatives of the Wikileaks said they were pleased with the emergence of a competitive service, because the information will be even more. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/107648/">https://habr.com/ru/post/107648/</a></p>
