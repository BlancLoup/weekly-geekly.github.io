  <section class="page js-page"><h1>3 simple criteria that you should not forget when creating mobile landing pages</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Landing pages - this is not the easiest thing when creating websites for the desktop, not to mention the sites for mobile devices.  Among other things, the latter have another problem: space.  You want to achieve efficiency and at the same time meet the needs of a mobile audience, needs that are significantly different from computer users.  And all this needs to be done within the very limited space provided by mobile sites. <br><br>  Users who download pages through a computer are very different from those who surf the Internet ‚Äúon the go‚Äù through their mobile phones, tablets and other devices.  The first step towards creating an effective mobile landing page is to recognize their differences and adjust your strategy accordingly.  There are difficulties that are unique to mobile devices. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Before you begin working on the landing page for mobile devices, ask yourself a few questions, the answers to which will help you create the best usability for your mobile users.  Improved usability increases user engagement, which further rapidly increases the conversion rate of your mobile site. <br><br>  The approach and motivation of the mobile user are different, but the only thing that does not change is that they all want a comfortable experience using the site and want to get what they need.  Here are three ways to understand your mobile audience, which allow you to create a page that meets the needs of your target audience. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

    <h4>  1. How convincing is your call to action - have you eliminated all the gaps? </h4><br>  In addition to the inclusion of a call-to-action button on the mobile landing page, do the rest of the elements do something to get users to call-to-action?  Have you eliminated the gaps and gaps so that the user does not have problems with following a call to action? <br><br>  You will need to add elements called ‚Äúconfidence building‚Äù, i.e.  tell your audience why you are a source worthy of their trust, and why you can meet their needs.  For example, the lack of social identity markers is a certain flaw on the landing page that can make a gullible Internet user skeptical about you - who are you and why should I trust you? <br><br>  Here are a few things you can add to your landing page to increase its credibility: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Snippets with reviews from previous customers ‚Ä¢ <br>  ‚Ä¢ Logos of well-known reputable companies that are your partners ‚Ä¢ <br>  ‚Ä¢ Social proof, preferably immediately before the call-to-action area on the landing page ‚Ä¢ <br>  ‚Ä¢ A brief and neat form for user feedback, so that users do not suffer - you can call or write them a letter later to get all the necessary information. <br><br><h4>  2. Do users really need this information? </h4><br>  The method of collecting information by the user on a mobile device differs from the style of user behavior at the computer, since their expectations differ.  To draw this parallel in a more understandable way, look at these two users as people trying to eat. <br><br>  A user at a computer has both a place and time, so that he can carefully set the table, take a napkin and put it on his knees, and pour himself some water or wine before starting a meal from several dishes - soup, main course, dessert and even coffee.  Their computer environment allows you to search and digest information on topics of interest to them, follow links to other useful resources, until they are completely satisfied. <br><br>  For users of mobile devices is not.  Mobile user - he is like a child who played in the yard, and suddenly felt hungry.  He runs home and is looking for something to eat, something that will quickly and easily help kill hunger before the next meal.  A mobile user typically uses small pieces of information that satisfy very specific needs.  They need everything to be fast, and they don‚Äôt want to break their legs trying to get it. <br><br>  How does this fit into the layout of your mobile landing page? <br><br>  Make sure that you can provide what your mobile user needs, easily digestible, or they will run to look for someone else who can.  For example, you may have a landing page that is ten screens down, and you will expect the mobile user to patiently scroll through it all.  They need a "snack", so this is too much information, and this will scare them. <br><br>  You need just so much information so that it can satisfy the need to ‚Äúhave a snack‚Äù - most likely, they need one particular thing.  However, remember that each user is at the same stage of the purchase process, so you need to offer a page that contains important elements that guide the user through each stage of the cycle. <br><br>  Determine what they need at each stage, find out which keywords attract the attention of mobile users, to understand what stage they are at and suggest it.  Delete everything else that is not directly related to the final action that you expect from the user. <br><br><h4>  3. Can potential users with different source data understand your offer? </h4><br>  Your proposal MUST be understandable to any user, regardless of whether they came from a link from an email, a post on a social network, paid advertising, or another source that your site has reached.  Often, webmasters create landing pages with a sentence that is not supported by the context in which the proposal should be interpreted. <br><br>  The lack of a clear flow of information from the fundamentals and context to the proposal can scare away the mobile user.  Rather, they may forget exactly what you wanted while they scroll the screen.  Thus, the context goes beyond the brand and logo ‚Äî you need to include a heading explaining who you are and what you do. <br><br>  Make sure that your offer information is as straightforward as possible and as clear as possible.  Do not think that they knew it in advance, or learned from a source that sent them to your site.  The idea is that the landing page should contain enough information so that even an absolutely ‚Äúgreen‚Äù user can understand who you are, what you offer, and why it matters to him. <br><br>  Ultimately, you need to make sure your landing page has value for potential customers.  Therefore, relevance, compelling reasons, and an effective call-to-action scheme are all you need to get them to cross the line and fall right into your arms. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Useful Paysto solutions for Megamind readers:</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  ‚Üí <a href="http://linkcharge.ru/email">Get paid by credit card right now.</a>  <a href="http://linkcharge.ru/email">Without a site, PI and LLC.</a> <br>  ‚Üí <a href="http://linkcharge.ru/">Accept payments from companies via the Internet.</a>  <a href="http://linkcharge.ru/">Without a site, PI and LLC.</a> <br>  ‚Üí <a href="http://linkcharge.ru/api">Acceptance of payments from companies for your site.</a>  <a href="http://linkcharge.ru/api">With document circulation and exchange of originals.</a> <br>  ‚Üí <a href="http://linkcharge.ru/automat">Automation of sales and service transactions with legal entities.</a>  <a href="http://linkcharge.ru/automat">Without intermediary in the calculations.</a> <br><br></div></div></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/286620/">https://habr.com/ru/post/286620/</a></p>
