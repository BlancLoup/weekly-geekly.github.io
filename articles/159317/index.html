I decided to write about his version. <br><br>  In general, in the 3-room apartment I have ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù lighting a long time ago.  Its main goal is to press a smaller switch.  Initially, I placed four 12-volt colored spotlights in the corridor right in the floor.  Then he added another 2 in a small corridor, then another 2 inserted into the ceiling (more precisely, into the bottom of the mezzanine) near the kitchen.  In the floor, by the way, it is easy to install fixtures (the floors are on wooden lags): I took the nozzle for the drill, which is used to drill the door leaves under the handle.  She and made neat holes right through the laminate.  It turned out something like this: <br><br> <a href="http://ybex.com/d/bwkkqglet6rv2e1xqsj0izh7cpt984fz0fl0vkzu.html"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9e8/4af/a15/9e84afa1580b789e99a245a02bb68775.png"></a> <a href="http://ybex.com/d/ju1ts40onip31ptkxg1kfmzkr3glo7e76qgbl99q.html"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3c7/8aa/e69/3c78aae69976015786446e89a2686f15.png"></a> <br> <a href="http://ybex.com/d/vbila7i826dv9r8ywxsdhaepwcydi067et369t04.html"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6f2/36a/38e/6f236a38e1dd5b987b57111b8004fe91.png"></a>

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Over the front door hung a motion sensor that turns on this light.  Now at night you can walk around the apartment without running across the walls.  As a bonus, when you open the front door, it enters the zone of the sensor and the light turns on. <br><br>  To make it clearer, I attach the layout of the apartment: <br><br> <a href="http://ybex.com/d/isxqfz3dsvl01501gx6tt7oazcvf8bgwalrqtvvm.html"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4fb/cd3/b17/4fbcd3b17e4c972429c01360fc25c049.png"></a> <br><br>  In addition, a motion sensor was installed in the kitchen, and a 3-meter LED strip + a colored light bulb at the dining table was placed on the cabinet above the cooking zone.  When someone is in the kitchen, the cooking zone is highlighted no worse than the surgical table.  Very comfortably.  Nowadays, nobody in the kitchen turns on the overhead light, since it is also quite light. <br><br> <a href="http://ybex.com/d/4g2jyjzkfw4tk6k1aflb5o5w78hkvvp0ay9nru1p.html"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/502/83c/346/50283c3463c5c10b60867708b37fe700.png"></a> <br><br>  I also installed an illumination sensor and when it is light outside, I additionally illuminate a palm tree in a dark corner of the room so that I do not lose it.  But that's another story. <br><br>  Several years have passed since then, I began to slowly build a house, and since I want to make the house smart, and I will be engaged in electrician myself, I decided to train at the apartment with automation controllers.  To know at least where it is necessary to pull and in what quantity.  I almost immediately refused arduino, because I want something more ready: I ‚Äã‚Äãdefinitely don‚Äôt have enough energy for kulibinstvo, because I‚Äôm no longer a student.  Therefore, in the end I stopped at two controllers: <br><br>  Siemens Logo and Aries PLC. <br><br>  Siemens in ebee is cheaper, and the office is more solid.  Therefore, for the beginning I ordered it for $ 220.  It makes no sense to automate the whole world in a flat, so I decided to limit myself to the corridors (that is, the space outside the living rooms).  For this, I made a little wall, spent a few wires.  Replaced the traditional switches on the buttons for blinds.  They look something like this: <br><br> <a href="http://ybex.com/d/8679wwusih3o2cxx98hg5ijxlwnwi4ekn8djy91w.html"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/013/17a/8ad/01317a8ad23a191a652334c6c0e249aa.png"></a> <br><br>  To implement his ideas, he hung magnetic door opening sensors on both entrance doors.  On the staircase there is a motion sensor on the ceiling, so that it only works when you get close to the door: <br><br> <a href="http://ybex.com/d/mrits1e4q0mx60cdvqeozs3o7amwl7gd50b1o64s.html"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1d6/3f6/1a0/1d63f61a033a2e4e05fc71e3774e433d.png"></a> <br><br>  This is actually half the sensor.  To be more compact.  The second half (there is a small scheme) is in the apartment. <br><br>  Commuted the whole farm in the mezzanine: <br><br> <a href="http://ybex.com/d/z4uo8dza567jl33bitvxgvcevsm07m8ts20wk1dk.html"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8fe/db7/72d/8fedb772d62c40ffb29c635814617453.png"></a> <br><br>  I remembered the safety precautions, firefighters, etc ... I hung up a drawer in the closet under the ceiling and re-commuted everything in it (not forgetting about the wire markers, crimping pliers, terminal kits, zero tires, etc.): <br><br> <a href="http://ybex.com/d/n0b2he7r7qem5qsvzpx51d0p1tefycfxx090v2tk.html"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/615/8c5/e28/6158c5e2821862a58766f586eff9f349.png"></a> <br><br>  I wrote a program in Logo Soft Comfort.  Debug, by the way, can be in the simulator.  However, it is only after pouring into the controller and real use that the shoals that are not obvious to a non-specialist begin to pop out: <br><br> <a href="http://ybex.com/d/2osmeqckkx50wadtfwyd1mb0p7ir676nqakcu5no.html"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/680/924/acd/680924acd95e7fcdd8c1fe14e58be16e.png"></a> <br><br>  Poured it over the ethernet controller and voila ... <br><br>  Described quickly, but in fact the process took about a month.  I will not hide, quite fascinating. <br>  What is particularly like, that now, when everything is connected, it is possible in your free time, without touching the wiring, at least to completely rewrite the control circuit.  Add some functionality, etc.  Not later than yesterday, I did emulation of presence, which was turned on after 5 seconds of pressing the left button. <br><br>  Now I‚Äôm waiting for the expansion module for the logo to add several groups of light that I don‚Äôt manage yet, as there are not enough outputs, like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d79/8b7/37d/d798b737dcc1b0a23ec9ce5c6493ed93.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  I ordered for 129 bucks on ebee.  <a href="http://www.promspecrele.energoportal.ru/siemens-logo-dm16-230r-6ed1-055-1fb10-0ba0-6ed1055-1fb10-0ba0-6ed10551fb100ba0-401127.html">Description here</a> . <br><br>  What got now: <br><br>  1. at the entrance to the apartment the light turns on beautifully: first, the spot lights of the far small corridor, then the large one, then the chandelier in the corridor and the sconce in the closet come on.  It turns out that you open the door, and the light seems to run at you.  When you exit the apartment the whole world is cut down.  The definition of whether I enter or go out is done by analyzing the sequence in which the entrance doors were opened / closed.  Sensors cost a penny, bought in the store security equipment: <br><br> <a href="http://ybex.com/d/35kj3881nl3bij1yefl652gfjrckkur4o2yjowf8.html"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/35a/282/188/35a2821885a0cc35b5dd239f2cfad1d7.png"></a> <br><br>  Inclusion looks like this: <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/xGqaN1-t_WQ%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700255,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhiTcBnkatJQJn1-76_a6AMrOLb5Cg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  (the video does not see another group of light on the right, i.e., 4 groups in total are included in series. Actually, only the Siemens controller can control them for now). <br><br>  2. When you get into the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe motion sensor over the entrance door - all the spotlights in the pantry, corridor and small corridor turn on.  Light is cut off automatically after 60 seconds of no movement. <br>  From 23:45 to 7:00 the whole system is switched to night mode, in this mode the motion sensor does not turn on the light next to the bedroom.  It can only be turned on by hand from the switch, if necessary. <br><br>  3. The push buttons at the entrance door can be pressed with a short press or long.  By quick pressing, the upper light turns on and off.  With a long press, the whole world turns on / off, and at the same time the motion sensor turns off for 30 minutes. <br><br>  4. Motion sensor is available in the kitchen, it includes a bright LED illumination of the cooking zone, <br><br>  5. The sensor, located on the stairwell, includes a small piece of LED strip hidden by the door.  The light is not bright, so as not to attract special attention.  But finding a keyhole helps.  In addition, when someone is standing at the door a red light comes on at the door inside the apartment.  To know that someone is standing there :) <br><br>  Plans to add fan control hoods in the kitchen and bathroom.  Also, if the door to the toilet is opened / closed and there is movement there (with the door closed), then there is a person inside and we therefore keep the lights on until the door is opened / closed again.  If the door is closed and there is no movement, after 30 seconds the light is turned off.  Then in the bathroom / toilet you can do without switches. <br><br>  Got a good programming experience with Siemens controllers.  Much can be done on them, but still these are devices for automating a particular process, and not the whole house.  Writing scripts on it is very difficult and not at all obvious.  In fact, you write not a program, but you are engaged in circuitry.  There are no usual cycles, variables, etc. <br><br>  Therefore, I also want to buy a PLC 110 ram and practice on it.  It is a pity that the second apartment is not for experiments, so it‚Äôs just on the layout.  Aries is more expensive than the logo, but it has much more inputs and outputs (there are only 4 relay outputs and 8 inputs in the controller itself).  In the end, if you need to manage a large number of loads - on the ram is cheaper.  Also in Aries, a normal scripting language, not drawing diagrams.  Let it not so technologically, and not so reliably, but much simpler. <br><br> <a href="http://ybex.com/d/njf610m959zjjdoeo6gjk4n4mzc6qc5y49g3pqiw.html"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e7e/3c3/a22/e7e3c3a220fa7da139b46237be76cae6.png"></a> <br><br>  Ps.  And I have long been measuring the temperature of the house and on the street with 1-wire digital sensors.  True to automation, it has nothing to do.  Just write the data and display it here: <a href="http://temp.smolensk.ws/">temp.smolensk.ws</a> <br><br>  Pss.  commercial break: use the prog and the <a href="http://ybex.com/">ybex.com</a> service to also quickly place your photos on the internet, like me :) Free, without restrictions, without advertising ... for two years now it has been working in this mode. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/159317/">https://habr.com/ru/post/159317/</a></p>
