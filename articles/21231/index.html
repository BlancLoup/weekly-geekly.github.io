  <section class="page js-page"><h1>A big meeting of innovators in St. Petersburg took place-)</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  February 29, a big meeting of innovators took place in St. Petersburg on Friday. <br>  As mentioned earlier, the meeting was organized by <a href="http://www.liveidea.ru/">LiveIdea</a> , <a href="http://www.ifmo.ru/">St. Petersburg State University ITMO</a> , <a href="http://qd.ifmo.ru/">Intercollegiate Innovation Studio QD</a> , and the <a href="http://www.directorclub.ru/">Directors Club of St. Petersburg</a> . <br>  Despite the slightly pretentious name and venue (Smolny Light Hall), the meeting was held in a relaxed and warm atmosphere. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  There were a lot of interesting and active people.  Some of the experts, unfortunately, could not come, but their place was taken by other, no less experienced people, of whom there were many in the hall. <br>  The work was in full swing in the hall: project teams answered difficult questions and tasks (they were all related to one or another side of the projects), presented their startups to investors and experts (each team presented its project to ten experts).  Often, teams and experts found it difficult to part: this was how their conversation and discussion of a problem were captivating.  However, a certain amount of time was devoted to each task ... But in the remaining time at the end of the event, everyone who wanted was given the opportunity to communicate in full. <br>  The audience was able to observe the work of the teams, the presentation of their projects and even participate in heated debates with experts. <br>  In general, despite some drawbacks, according to the participants themselves, the event was fruitful and interesting. <br>  Investors will offer some teams the financing of their projects, some will receive support from the Coaching Institute and QD Student Innovation Studio. <br>  I myself received a lot of positive impressions and made many new and interesting acquaintances. <br>  Let's hope that this meeting will not be the last in a similar format. <br>  In the end, all participants agreed to meet again next year at the ‚ÄúBig Meeting of Innovators‚Äù II. </div>
