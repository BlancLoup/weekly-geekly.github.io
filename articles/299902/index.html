In it, he, among other things, talks about how to test the viability of ideas.  Rice is obsessed with mini-checks and iterative moves.  The very first test of an idea should prove not only that your product is interesting to buyers, but also that they will be willing to pay for it.  Even before the creation of the minimum version of the product (MVP), he advises to place on the Internet a simple landing page, which is referenced in advertisements.  On the page there should be a brief description of the product and the "Buy" button.  You can make many options for landing pages, varying the price and essence of the proposal.  After collecting statistics, you can already begin to develop a prototype.  This principle Rice calls: "First ask - then do."  To test ideas, followers of the lean method also often use The Validation Board, a free product that is a lined board, each part of which is an important element of a successful startup idea. <br><br>  Disney Test <br>  Walt Disney used in his work the method of testing ideas, which he called Imagineering - the average between imagination and engineering (Eng .: imagination and development. - Approx. H &amp; F).  By this he meant the process of ‚Äúgrounding‚Äù fantasies, turning them into something realistic and possible.  Work on the idea required consideration of it from three different positions: a dreamer, a realist, a critic. <br><br>  The dreamer is full of various ideas, desires, images and does not meet any obstacles on his way.  At this stage there is no censorship, nothing is considered too absurd or stupid, anything is possible here.  To take the position of a dreamer, you can ask yourself: ‚ÄúIf I had a magic wand, what would I do?‚Äù The realist transforms the ideas of the dreamer into something practical and probable.  He asks questions about how to make it work, what parts the task consists of, what is its meaning, what is it similar to already existing.  The critic considers ideas from the point of view of their shortcomings.  He asks the questions: ‚ÄúWhat am I really thinking about this?  Is it really the best option of all?  What can I do to improve this? ‚Äù <br><br>  At the Disney Company, teams worked on ideas, moving from room to room in stages.  Each room had its own function: in the first - it was possible to fantasize, in the second - to create sketches, in the third - it was allowed to criticize furiously.  Often, the project again returned for revision to the first or second room.  The idea was considered accepted when in the "room of critics" no one said a word. <br><br>  First mile test <br>  The founder of Innosight, Scott Anthony, in his book, The First Mile, writes about how his company usually tests ideas for strength.  First of all, they conduct a careful analysis of what has already been created in this area, study the experience of competing companies, and verify patent applications.  Then they arrange a mental experiment, answering the questions: ‚ÄúWhat will the world look like if the idea is waiting for success?  What will change in it?  Which companies will compete with us?  What problems can we face?  What, for example, will we do if our main developer leaves us? ‚ÄùThe third stage consists in building an monetization model‚Äú by eye ‚Äù: you need to determine what size the potential audience of the future product will be, how much it will cost, how often it will be bought, how long it takes to reach the break-even point. <br><br>  The fourth stage is associated with calls.  Anthony says that often the success of an idea is associated with the existence in our mind of some assumptions, ideas about how the world works.  You can check them by simply making one call.  For example, if your idea is to deliver healthy lunches to universities by making one call, you can find out that such issues are usually resolved through a tender that takes place every three years.  The next step is to get some evidence that consumers need your product.  It can be a ‚Äúcoffee test‚Äù when you ask your friends to honestly tell you what they think about your idea, in exchange for what you pay for their coffee.  This may be a ‚Äúcold‚Äù survey on a database of potential customers or a survey made using SurveyMonkey. <br><br>  10 second test <br>  Janet Kraus now teaches at the Harvard Business School, and before that she founded several successful companies (among them Circles and Spire).  She tells her students about a 10-second test, which she uses every time she gets a startup idea.  She asks herself the question: is this idea Oxygen, Aspirin, or Jewel for potential customers? <br><br>  Oxygen is related to products that are an essential vital need, like food, clothing, funeral services.  Needs can be from individuals as well as from organizations.  In general, this is something without which they can not function normally.  Aspirin is something that saves from pain and makes life more bearable, although not related to immediate survival.  For example, coffee - life without it is possible, but not so pleasant.  The term "jewel" refers to products and services that can be considered a luxury, a surplus.  For example, desserts, movies, video games and other pleasures associated with relaxation.  Kraus says that a really good startup idea should satisfy all three requirements.  And the main thing in this test is to be honest with yourself and quickly recognize that <br><br>  Edison way <br>  Thomas Edison left 1093 patents, among which were such inventions as a light bulb, a typewriter, a phonograph, a battery and a movie camera.  Also, after him, there were 3,500 notebooks in which he obsessedly wrote down every thought that occurred to him.  Researchers who tried to understand the secret of creative productivity of Edison, identified several features of his method of working with ideas.  Edison's first rule is quantity.  He set himself the so-called quotas for inventions for himself and the employees of his company.  His own quota was: one small invention once every ten days and one big invention every six months.  To test this principle for yourself, imagine that you are asked to come up with all the ways to use brick alternatively.  On average, an ordinary person offers six to eight options.  Now imagine that you were given the task to come up with 40 ways to use bricks.  Thanks to the given quota, your head will start working differently. <br><br>  The second principle - for Edison there was no such thing as an unsuccessful experiment, in his view all these ‚Äúattempts and errors‚Äù were ways of gaining useful experience.  To invent the battery, Edison conducted about 50,000 experiments.  For a light bulb - 9,000. After each failed experiment, he wrote down what he learned about the subject.  He perceived the process of creativity as hard, monotonous, honest work.  In his opinion, the first ideas are always weaker than the next ones, because first you start from things you are used to and they hold back your imagination. <br><br>  The third principle is to never rest on our laurels, constantly improve ideas and experiment with their application in various fields.  The Edison Museum has preserved a huge number of phonograph options: round, square, wooden, flat and high.  All this - the results of rejected ideas.  When Edison was once asked what the secret of his creativity was, he replied: "Never stop working on the subject until he starts working himself." </blockquote><blockquote>  Landing page + social network groups </blockquote><blockquote>  Viability is tested on the free version, testers are invited.
