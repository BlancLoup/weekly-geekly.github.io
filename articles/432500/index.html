My application for the right to take the exam was selected for an audit, and we managed to pass the audit on the second attempt.  Under the cut my experience: </p><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2 id="dolgaya-doroga-dlinoy-v-chetyre-goda">  Four years long road </h2><br><p>  The first time I was going to take an exam four years ago.  Like many others, I registered on the PMI website, applied for an exam, received confirmation, paid for membership, downloaded PMBoK and ... and immediately received an appointment for an interesting project that took up all my free time.  The PMP surrender had to be postponed. <br>  Two years later, I again decided to take up the preparation.  Yes, yes, I registered on the PMI website, submitted an application, received confirmation, paid for the membership, downloaded PMBoK and ... received a promotion.  New position, a lot of interesting work, lack of time, in general, the surrender of PMP again had to be postponed. <br>  Despite the fact that I did not go to the exam, I spent some time trying to figure out what methods of preparation exist and understand what works well for me and what does not.  In particular, nothing categorically ‚Äústuck‚Äù to me from Rita MulKahi‚Äôs book.  Even dry PMBoK was easier for me to read. </p><br><h2 id="v-tretiy-raz-zaklinanie-ne-rabotaet-audit-zayavki">  The third time the spell does not work, the audit application </h2><br><p>  Last summer, I thought that I had stayed in one place, there were no interesting projects, I was tired of the routine, in general, I had to change something.  There is a proven way - you only need to apply for PMP (just kidding).  The third time the spell did not work, neither the position nor the interesting project was offered to me.  In addition, my application was audited. </p><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">This is how PMI‚Äôs email informs you that an application has been selected for audit:</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><blockquote>  Dear winston smith <br><br>  We have received your application.  Your application has been selected for PMI's audit process.  It is not a problem. <br><br>  Please submit your audit materials by Oct 22 2018.

      If you have any questions or concerns. </blockquote></div></div><br><h2 id="audit-provalen-chitayte-handbook-pered-tem-kak-podavat-zayavku">  Audit failed, read handbook before applying </h2><br><p>  As it turned out, there is nothing terrible in the audit, a special section opens in the PMI site‚Äôs personal account, which clearly describes the requirements and the process of collecting and sending documents confirming education, training and work experience (looking ahead, the incorrect description of the experience in the application became the reason is not a successful audit). </p><br><h3 id="podtverzhdenie-treningov">  Training Confirmation </h3><br><p>  With training, everything is relatively simple.  It is necessary to include in the package of documents copies of certificates of attendance of trainings that give contact hours, and list them in a cover letter.  Some course providers issue two certificates, for example in Russian (or another local) and in English, or a certificate from an educational platform (for example, Udemy) and a certificate from the author of the training.  In general, you need to attach a copy of the certificate from the author of the training in English. </p><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Sample Cover Letter</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><blockquote>  Dear PMI Audit team, <br>  Winston Smith (Candidate ID: 777777) as requested to perform audit of application 555555. <br><br>  <b>Package content:</b> <br>  <b>Project experience</b> <br>  Project experience, confirmed by Big Brother (1 envelop) <br>  Project experience, confirmed by Emmanuel Goldstein (1 envelop) <br>  Project experience, confirmed by James O'Brien (1 envelop) <br><br>  <b>Project Management Education</b> <br>  PROPS-C for Project Managers, Copy of training certificate (1 page) <br>  Project management based on standard ANSI PMI PMBoK V.5, Copy of training certificate (1 page) <br><br>  <b>Attained education</b> <br>  Oceania Technical University: Mobile communications Engineer. <br>  Copy of Diploma and transcript (4 pages, Russian language) <br>  Diploma and transcript (1 page) </blockquote></div></div><br><p>  By the way, about the trainings, I already had enough contact hours received due to the training paid by the employer.  Later in the process of preparation, I discovered the source of cheap contact hours in the form of trainings on the Udemy <a href="https://www.udemy.com/pmp-pmbok6-35-pdus/">example</a> .  35 hours for 10 USD is quite good.  The main thing is to carefully read the summary of the training and make sure that it is provided by a provider accredited by PMI (Registered Education Provider or REP). </p><br><h3 id="podtverzhdenie-osnovnogo-obrazovaniya">  Proof of basic education </h3><br><p>  A little harder.  here you need to attach a copy of the diploma and the insert (transcript) and a simple (not notarial) translation of the diploma and the insert. </p><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">My example</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><blockquote>  General Translation to Diploma and transcript <br>  <b>Diploma:</b> <br>  London, Oceania <br>  Federal state educational institution of Higher professional education <br>  OCEANIA TECHNIACL UNIVERSITY <br>  DIPLOMA (Honors), AAA 777777 <br>  According to state assessment commission on June 7, 1965 mr.

PMI is interested in your experience in each project being described in terms and processes of PMI.  Unfortunately, I did not read the <a href="https://www.pmi.org/-/media/pmi/documents/public/pdf/certifications/project-management-professional-handbook.pdf">PMP Handbook</a> well enough and made a fairly common mistake: I described the experience of project work in terms of the value acquired by the company and customers. </p><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Here is the wrong description of the experience</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><blockquote>  <b>Title</b> <br>  MTS, Russia, RAN rollout <br><br>  <b>Role</b> <br>  Other: Project acceptance manager <br><br>  <b>Description</b> <br>  Mobile TeleSystems UMTS RAN for Mobile TeleSystems across the Russia.  I was responsible for accepting and ending up a meeting of the Russian Federation. </blockquote></div></div><br><p>  As it turned out, PMI does not audit the application until it receives a package of documents.  The audit confirmation form for each project is generated automatically in the personal account on the PMI website.  The form must be downloaded, signed by the contact person indicated in the application who can confirm your experience (for example, the director of the employer or client or your direct manager).  The experience description in the confirmation form is copied from the application. <br>  In my case, an incorrect description of the experience was copied from the application.  PMI checked my experience for the first time only after receiving a package of documents.  The experience was described incorrectly, and PMI rejected my application. <br>  By the way, the cheapest way was to send documents using EMS.  Sending from Moscow cost about 1,700 rubles.  The package went to the addressee about 10 days, 2 days from the entry point in the USA to PMI by ordinary American mail and 8 days in Russia by express mail EMS. </p><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">This is how PMI notifies that a package of documents has been received.</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><blockquote> Dear winston smith <br><br>  Documentation for your Project Management Professional (PMP) application. <br><br>  Thank you for submitting this material.
