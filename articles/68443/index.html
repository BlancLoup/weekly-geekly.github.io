The top three winners will get the opportunity to present their products at the largest Adobe MAX 2009 conference in California this October. <br><br>  One of the leaders of the first semi-final vote on the site O'reilly has become a product for the simple creation and editing of full-fledged flash sites - <a href="http://www.flashmoto.com/">Flashmoto</a> .

      This is one of the few participants in such a prestigious vote, if not the only one, the mention of which can already be found in the Russian-speaking segment of the Internet (here for example: <a href="http://flasher.ru/forum/showthread.php%3Ft%3D128984">flasher.ru/forum/showthread.php?t=128984</a> ).  The thing is that in addition to the main developers, a pool of young flash and flex specialists from Ukraine and Russia takes part in the creation and testing of the product.  This, by the way, is another confirmation of the fact that Russian brains are highly valued in the west. <br><br>  After reading about the Russian ‚Äúroots‚Äù of Flashmoto, I could not deny myself the pleasure of reaching out to one of the Russian-language product developers, who, as anonymity, told me some details of the specifics of Flashmoto, unknown to anyone yet.  So, this is a mini-interview ... <br><br>  <b>Greetings, I understand that there is very little time.</b>  <b>Therefore, immediately to the point.</b>  <b>What is unique in Flashmoto that we don‚Äôt know yet?</b> <br><br>  This CMS should become the first full-fledged system, with the help of which it will be possible to create and edit not just business card sites, but also full-fledged multi-page sites and good commercial sites.  In fact, in the product we produce there are no restrictions on the structure of the website being created or on animation and multimedia - everything is limited only by the hands and knowledge of the webmaster. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>That is, it turns out, such a perfect flash builder?</b> <br><br>  Generally, strictly speaking, the system is not a flash site builder in its essence.  That is why we have absolutely no restrictions on animation.  You should also take into account that, because of the builder‚Äôs ability to completely remove any content on the site, an inexperienced client usually harms the site, sometimes irreparably.  Flashmoto is not a classic builder, working on ready-made templates was able to integrate into the final product things inherent to builders, such as WYSIWYG editor, which greatly simplifies the life of everyone involved in the process of creating a site. <br><br>  <b>It is clear with the editor - this is more a solution for users who have no experience, but what have you prepared for developers working with flash sites?</b> <br><br>  For developers creating flash sites, we have provided the possibility of implementing any add-ons to perform functional tasks in the form of modules.  Tasks for displaying visual objects on a flash site from a calendar or clock to a full-fledged online store with a built-in catalog can be implemented equally easily. <br><br>  Thanks to these modules, developers will be able to create visual components that are displayed in the visible part of the site, as well as create their own modules for the administration panel, which will manage the visual components in the visible part of the site directly from the admin area.  This has not been implemented in any CMS.  For example, it will be easy to implement the RSS feed on the flash site and integrate all the controls of this feed with all kinds of settings into the administrative part of the site itself.  All instructions and detailed explanations will be available to developers with the release. <br><br>  <b>There is a question on the language versions of the product.</b>  <b>Will you be oriented to the western market or will you pay attention to the development of a multilingual version?</b> <br><br>  The font manager is another pride of ours.  Flashmoto can download and support any fonts in the form of .swf files, which will allow users to independently make the site multilingual.  Wanted site in Chinese - downloaded the necessary fonts and please use. <br><br>  <b>And what about the well-known problem of converting OTF files to swf?</b> <br><br>  We knew about this problem from the very beginning, so along with the release in the final product, the online font creator will be available with which it will be possible to convert the native fonts to the swf and easily download them to the control panel. <br><br>  <b>What technologies did Flashmoto use?</b> <br><br>  On PureMVC and uses PureMVC Pipes.  So developers who are familiar with these technologies will find it easy to create their own widgets and modules. <br><br>  <b>What are the next plans?</b> <br><br>  There is a huge list of "chips", which will definitely be implemented in Flashmoto, but now all the forces are thrown to the early release of the product.  In addition, we are actively engaged in the mobilization of our supporters on the eve of Adobe MAX 2009. <br><br>  <b>What exactly connects you with Adobe MAX 2009?</b> <br><br>  The fact is that, as you probably know, our product became the finalist of the voting for the best RIA application implemented in 2009.  If we win the final, then representatives of Russia and Ukraine engaged in the development of Flashmoto will have the opportunity to participate in this conference.  This will be one of the first cases when our developers will represent the product at this level ... <br><br>  <b>The end of the interview.</b> <br><br>  Here are some of the "savory" details about the product, from the original source.  The chance to get on Adobe MAX is very real.  Especially if we all help :) <br><br>  Voting for the finalists will go here: <a href="">oreillynet.com/insideria/polls/237.csp</a> <br><br>  It will last from September 1 to 6.  Agree, it would be cool if Flashmoto developers, the backbone of which are Russian and Ukrainian developers, would go to present their product on Adobe MAX 2009. <br><br>  Personally, I have already voted for them ... 2 times =) <br><br>  PS: The main text of the news was provided to me by one of the developers of Flashmoto. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/68443/">https://habr.com/ru/post/68443/</a></p>
