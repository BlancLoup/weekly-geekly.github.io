Nature has generously endowed Steve Jobs with talents, including the ability to inspire people in ways that only missionaries and national leaders can do.  Anyone who was lucky enough to visit some public performance of Steve (sometimes lasting more than one hour) could personally see how enthusiastically this first-class showman improvised on the subject of technology - yes, maybe more about life, what he sees himself.  This excerpt from the book ‚ÄúiCona‚Äù most accurately reveals the identity of this extraordinary person. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

    <h2>  Interesting facts from the biography </h2><br>  The founder of Apple got into the Guinness Book of Records as a director with the most modest salary in the world according to official documents; Jobs' salary is $ 1 a year. <br><br>  Jobs has always been overconfident.  When he ran out of radio parts at age 12, he called William Hewlett (the one from Hewlett-Packard) and asked for help to get the necessary details: ‚ÄúMy name is Steve Jobs, and I would like to know if you have any spare parts would use to build a frequency counter. "  The most interesting thing is that he got the necessary details. <br><br>  As chairman of Apple's board of directors, Jobs filed an application to take part in a flight on the Challenger spacecraft.  He was refused, apparently, did not have enough merit or health.  January 28, 1986  The Challenger exploded in 73 seconds of flight. <br><br>  In 1974, Steve Jobs got a job at Atari and persuaded the management to pay him a trip to India, where he exchanged all his things for a beggar‚Äôs worn clothes.  He made a pilgrimage, hoping for the help of ordinary strangers.  This trip greatly influenced his world view: he saw real poverty. <br><br><h2>  Quotes from Steve Jobs </h2><br><blockquote>  Sometimes life hits you in the head with a brick.  Do not lose faith.  I am convinced that the only thing that helped me to continue the business was that I loved my business.  You need to find what you love.  And this is as true for work as it is for relationships.  Your work will fill most of your life and the only way to be completely content is to do what you think is a great thing.  And the only way to do great things is to love what you do. <br><br>  The memory that I will die soon is the most important tool that helps me make difficult decisions in my life.  Because everything else is another's opinion, all this pride, all this fear of embarrassment or failure ‚Äî all these things fall in the face of death, leaving only what is really important.  The memory of death is the best way to avoid thinking about what you have to lose.  You are already naked.  You have no reason not to go to the call of your heart. <br><br>  Death is probably the best invention of life.  She is the cause of change.  It clears the old to open the way to the new. <br><br>  Stay hungry.  Stay reckless.  <a href="http://romankalugin.com/rech-stiva-dzhobsa-pered-vyipusknikami-ctenforda">From the speech of Steve Jobs to Stanford graduates</a> <br></blockquote><br><br>  Sometimes Steve Jobs is very harsh: looking at the first samples of the personal ‚Äúsmart‚Äù Segway electric scooter with a computer balancing system, Steve Jobs barked: ‚ÄúI think it sucks ...‚Äù.  Jobs then called the main shareholder of the company, called the manager he hired ‚Äúa club‚Äù and said that his marketing director ‚Äúmust sell toilet paper at a discount store somewhere in Idaho.‚Äù  When officials asked Jobs to take part in an antitrust lawsuit against Microsoft, the head of Apple snapped at the assistant attorney general: ‚ÄúAre you serious about something?  Or again you will not have them? " <br><br><h2>  Steve Jobs Reviews </h2><br><ul><li>  Bill Gates: ‚ÄúI admire Steve's style.  And it's not a joke." </li><li>  Steve Wozniak: "I always believed that Steve would lead all of humanity." </li></ul><br><br><h2>  Property and Finance </h2><br>  In 1979, Apple Computer began selling its shares, and even then, in its 24, Steve Jobs became a millionaire.  Steve immediately bought himself a big house not far from the city of Los Altos.  Adhering to asceticism, Jobs refused all furniture, only in the bedroom there were several mattresses, a lamp and an expensive stereo system.  Nevertheless, his new Mercedes and BMW motorcycle were waiting for him near his mansion. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/aec/64d/07a/aec64d07a516c6654cb7568410f19ae7.jpg" alt="sjobs-house.jpg" width="577" height="433"><br><br><ul><li>  Apple‚Äôs official salary is $ 1 a year. </li><li>  Steve Jobs is the largest shareholder of Disney.  In 2006, Jobs sold Pixar to Walt Disney for $ 7.4 billion in shares of the company, receiving 7 percent of the company's shares and taking a seat on the board of directors. </li></ul><br><br><h2>  Hobbies </h2><br>  Jobs has been a Beatles fan for many years.  In addition, he loves classical music, especially Bach.  She closely follows the work of Barbara Streisand, often attends concerts and other events with her participation. <br><br>  He enjoys traveling and cycling, and is also a follower of Zen Buddhism. <br><br><h2>  Beliefs </h2><br><ul><li>  Personalities "are wonderful and noble, and some of them are also smart." </li><li>  You can make people do great things by giving them great tools - this is what he considers the best in the technology world. </li></ul><br><br><h3>  Political beliefs </h3><br>  Democrat.  Steve Jobs wanted to be involved in politics in 1985, after leaving Apple, but later dropped out.  He believed: ‚ÄúI am not a party-oriented person.  I am human-oriented. <br><br>  Steve Jobs always expresses his opinion on education.  He objected to the inflexibility of the American education system, citing an example of the impossibility of dismissing teachers. <br><br><h2>  Style </h2><br>  In all of his presentations, Steve Jobs looks the same and unusual for a big company manager: Steve puts on similar Levi's blue jeans, black turtleneck sweater and sneakers from year to year.  Probably, this is what he attracts attention to, makes it clear that he is ‚Äúhis‚Äù, and not a person removed from most people.  Jobs' style influenced the style of the company: on the same presentations, Apple‚Äôs vice-presidents look exactly the same.  The same technique is used in the ‚ÄúGet a Mac‚Äù advertisement, where Windows appears as a business man in an expensive suit, and Mac - in a t-shirt, jeans and gym shoes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/90a/bcb/ac3/90abcbac3116741ab92eaf7d25f45a61.jpg" width="577" height="486"><br><br>  An ovation has always meant a solemn expression of public gratitude.  And today, the public thanks those whose efforts have made their home and office digital fully.  These people really change the world for the better.  Thanks to them, thanks to Steve Jobs!  Long ovation, curtain. <br><br>  Source <a href="http://haywired.ru/">Haywired.ru</a> <br>  If you liked the article, then you can subscribe to RSS.  <a href="http://haywired.ru/feed/">Subscribe to RSS feed</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/38356/">https://habr.com/ru/post/38356/</a></p>
