True</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  "Thanks to <a href="http://megamozg.ru/post/15532/">such</a> people, I will never be without work."  The motto of the specialist. <br><br>  Let's start with the simple truth.  The client's wish ‚ÄúWe need a 1C server for 20 users‚Äù in the 1C world is just the same as coming to a restaurant and saying ‚ÄúI need to feed 20 people.‚Äù  Who are these people?  Are they vegetarians, fasting, omnivores?  Need a snack, lunch, dinner or buffet?  Do they have a holiday, conference, convention of Scientologists, or just wanted to eat?  The simple truth here is the following: for each decision you need to choose your own tool. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  a common part </h4><br>  If we consider only typical 1C configurations for commercial enterprises, then we can make the following rating <br><br><ul><li>  Configuration "Enterprise Accounting".  The most popular product from 1C.  Appears on the company with the first hired an accountant.  Modern accounting standard in commercial organizations of the Russian Federation.  Basic version 3 300 rub., Full version 13 000 rub. </li><li>  Configuration "Salary and Personnel Management".  The second most popular product.  Appears at a commercial enterprise, as soon as its staff exceeds 5 or more people, it all depends on the workload of the payroll accountant.  Basic version 4 600 rub., Full version 17 400 rub. </li><li>  Configuration "Trade Management".  Helps to bring more or less order in the management accounting of the company.  Purchased when the state has 10 employees or more.  Strongly dependent on the management and business processes of the company (if any).  Full version 17 400 rub. </li><li>  Configurations of "ERP Enterprise Management 2.0" or "UPP 1.3".  Very expensive, very difficult.  I don‚Äôt cite prices and the number of people, because a conversation about these configurations without implementation will serve the company as a disservice, and the need arises with the understanding that "this is no longer possible to live." </li></ul>

      In this short list, the configurations ‚ÄúSimplified‚Äù, ‚ÄúEntrepreneur‚Äù, ‚ÄúRetail‚Äù, ‚ÄúSmall Firm Management‚Äù, ‚ÄúIntegrated Automation‚Äù, ‚ÄúDocument Flow‚Äù and others are omitted, because these are all half-measures that solve specific problems and individually, lost against the background basic typical configurations. <br><br>  Well, now we ask ourselves why the company needs a 1C server for 20 users?  There are several typical reasons. <br><br><h4>  The accounting department of a large firm sits on 1C </h4><br>  In this case, you need to pay attention to 1C in the cloud.  Go to <a href="https://1cfresh.com/price">1cfresh.com/price</a> and count the money for the 2 most popular configurations for 20 users: <a href="https://1cfresh.com/price">29,664 + 5,933</a> * 15 = 118,659 rubles.  in year.  Full support, constant availability (as long as there is Internet, and where is it now?), Resiliency, backups, ITS and just a good mood. <br><br>  Many companies (or rather their managers) do not want to trust their data to clouds, fearing for their safety and accessibility (while the safety and availability of data on a server standing at its feet is considered a priori higher than in the cloud, and this is a big mistake).  Let's make a small calculation for such users taking the data on the server price from <a href="http://megamozg.ru/post/15532/">this</a> article. <br><br><table><tbody><tr><td>  Iron server </td><td>  150,000 rubles </td></tr><tr><td>  Enterprise Accounting Configuration </td><td>  13 000 rub. </td></tr><tr><td>  Salary and Personnel Management Configuration </td><td>  17 400 rub. </td></tr><tr><td>  Client license for 20 workstations 1C: Enterprise 8 (USB) </td><td>  97 600 rub. </td></tr><tr><td>  1C: Enterprise 8.3.  Server License (x86-64) (USB) </td><td>  103 700 rub. </td></tr><tr><td>  Subscription of ITS TECHNO for 1 year (allows you to update configurations and platform and nothing more) </td><td>  12,528 rubles. </td></tr><tr><td>  <b>Total</b> </td><td>  <b>394 228 rubles.</b> </td></tr></tbody></table><br><br>  I‚Äôll just say that you can take 1C licenses not USB, but software ones, but the difference between them is 19,600 + 17,300 = 36,900 rubles, but a headache per million. <br><br>  Linux and PostgreSQL are put on the server, for a price of 70,000 rubles.  or less, and if there is a familiar admin with experience, then for a bottle of good alcohol, because  the entire installation by the professional takes no more than a few hours, including constant ‚Äúsmart‚Äù backups and time synchronization (in 1C this is very important, it‚Äôs strange that little is written about this and due attention is not paid to by the implementers). <br><br>  It should be understood that we do not build a fault-tolerant system, in the full sense of the word, and also, unlike <a href="http://megamozg.ru/post/15532/">this</a> article, the coming ones will not fence us with their domains that do not belong to the 1C server any sideways (I‚Äôm cunning if you configure entry into 1C through the domain, it can increase security). <br><br>  Let's pay attention to the economic side of the issue, the cost of its infrastructure exceeds cloud-based cost more than 3 times, while each year it is necessary to extend the ITS, maintain your server, update configurations, pray about the condition of purchased hardware and deal with other sudden problems.  Considering that a server after 3 years, at least half, is morally obsolete, and paying for a cloud needs not one time, you should carefully study the issue of security between the cloud and your decision and take the only right decision, i.e.  go to the clouds with the whole civilized world. <br><br><h4>  Not only accountants are sitting in 1C </h4><br>  In this case, you have to fork out and buy your server.  The prices are described above + the price of that configuration, which makes it impossible to use the cloud, or go to a universal cloud, i.e.  not tied to 1C as a service, but this is a completely different story both in terms of technology and money, which depends heavily on the needs of a particular company. <br><br>  As you can see, in reality, there are no half a million for Microsoft licenses, domains for 1C and other rubbish, but there is a solution to the user's needs, and not the mythical horse in a vacuum. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/290760/">https://habr.com/ru/post/290760/</a></p>
