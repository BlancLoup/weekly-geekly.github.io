This is a list of drawbacks compared to other mobile operating systems on the market.  We do not compare special features or abilities, but only those that have become the norm for all smartphones, even for the simplest dialers.  Android, Symbian or MeeGo have only a few of the listed drawbacks.  The ability of the iPhone to transfer files also has limitations, but they still went far ahead of WP7.5.  Even the Nokia N9 with the first generation of MeeGo OS is much better and does not have all these catastrophic problems that prevent the smartphone from being used normally. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h1>  OS restrictions </h1>  1. There is no real multitasking, applications are ‚Äúfrozen‚Äù in the background.

Maximum 16Gb of memory per device. <br><br>  6. There is no file manager.  The file system is completely opaque. <br><br>  7. Zune needed to transfer files.

It is impossible to establish a static IP in the connection, and, therefore, to connect to the ad-hoc network <br><br>  14. You can not sync with Outlook without syncing with the cloud. <br><br>  15.

There is no encryption support on the client side, which is needed for secure applications like mobile banking and online payment. <br><br>  25. It is impossible to transfer sound from video to Bluetooth devices, since the A2DP profile is not implemented (!). <br><br>  26. No Bluetooth support (no HID profile). <br><br>  27. It is impossible to turn down the sound of a ringtone or alarm by turning the phone over. <br><br>  28. Strongly limited customization capability. <br><br>  29.

You can not search for the music collection in the phone, only in the Marketplace. <br><br>  39. You can not close the music player, you can only minimize.

You can not rewind the current song, you can not see what song from the album is playing. <br><br>  41.

The calendar does not have a weekly view, the monthly is not scalable. <br><br>  52. If you received a letter with an attachment, the phone will download it, there is no schedule that saves you from unwanted downloads. <br><br>  53.

No live wallpapers, widgets, themes. <br><br>  55. No vibro-feedback from the keyboard. <br><br>  56. No svaypa. <br><br>  57. And flush. <br><br>  58. And Java. <br><br>  59. And call records. <br><br>  60. And call blocking. <br><br>  61. Forget about screenshots. <br><br>  62. No automatic wallpaper change. <br><br>  63.

Google Maps and Bing are not available in most countries outside of the USA. <br><br>  73. The time stamp of the email message does not show the year. <br><br>  74. Large differences in the available applications in different countries, users tied to the Marketplace. <br><br>  75. Not all of Bing‚Äôs features are available outside of states, especially Local Scout. <br><br><h1>  Dumber and Dumber </h1><br>  76. One volume level for all functions including playing music, ringtones, alarms, notifications. <br><br>  77. Wi-fi is turned off when the screen is off.  If the mobile network is available, it will be used instead, with obvious consequences. <br><br>  78. If you accept a text message while talking on the phone, the beep will stun you with full volume.  All other phones reduce it. <br><br>  79.

Forwarded email messages cannot be edited. <br><br>  107. The volume of notifications in headphones does not decrease. <br><br>  108.

Mobile Office cannot edit Office 97-2003 documents.  Normal for MS strategy, forcing users to update. <br><br>  112. Images embedded in email are not downloadable. <br><br>  113. It is necessary to press Bing cards to announce the direction to rotate. <br><br>  114. No Silverlight support. <br><br>  115.
