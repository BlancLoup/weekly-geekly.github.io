  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Where to put black WIKI? Tools for writing ideas.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  How many can remember, looking for ways to conveniently record and store ideas. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  A lot of ideas.  Come often.  With the advent of computers, much of the recording and storage has become easier.  But still, at the moment when the idea came, it still has to decide how and where to fix it.  Spend time trying to figure out where to put her darling in the computer? <br>  But while you decide and create daddies, open a text document, until you complete all the ceremonies, the idea is yours!  Leave darling to the neighbor. <br>  And against such a sad outcome you have to be protected.  Like any respecting man, a condom must be hidden in any place in a bachelor's apartment.  so, in any creative person, notebooks and pencils are put in places and pockets.  We go to bed with a voice recorder - what if she covers you at night?  Go to the toilet?  It does not matter - the PDA in the pocket, in extreme cases, we will decompose solitaire. <br>  And over the years of such exhausting work, the situation has become such - hundreds of megabytes of text files are scattered in different folders, and in order to figure it all out, you now need a google desktop, or Linux beagle, and in advanced cases, just a doctor. <br><br>  Yes, Habratovarishchi!  We need to do something with the approach to recording and cataloging ideas.  Heavy Word and light text editors are not always suitable for this purpose.  Personally, I am constantly searching for new tools, catching news wherever I have to, summarizing what I found. <br>  Then one day a wonderful word wiki came to my mind.  Not that he discovered America, but summarized everything known. <br>  The hypertext nature of the wiki itself seems to be created to write into it everything that comes to mind, and then associate it with other entries, turning it into a web of ideas and sketches.  A kind of local web.  It remains only to find a simple tool that allows you to implement the above. <br><br>  For fans of Open Source, the wiki path is beneficial and open.  Options, including cross-platform (which is interesting especially) is enough.

      Ubuntu owners got a ride - they have a boyfriend Tom, or Tomboy.  Notes built on the wiki principle are easy to write and Tomboy catches links automatically (if a word with a description has already been created, all occurrences of a given word in other texts are automatically highlighted).  It is said that in Ubunt 7.10 in Tomboe a mechanism is already provided for transferring and synchronizing notes between several computers.  I will take a word.  The opportunity is necessary, given the growing number of owners of several computers.  How do I find the time to put a new system - check it out. <br>  But is it such a good fortune to have Tomboy on his home computer, and when he comes to work (go and eat the Hotz) look wistfully at the Vordovsky window?  They say that Tomboy can be run under Dot No and in Windows.  My hands are not growing from that place - it didn't work out. <br>  So I decided to look for something to create notes in the style of wiki, but cross-platform initially.  To throw on a flash drive at home, at work, opened, and stay in nirvana. <br><br>  - WikidPAD - complete mortality! <br>  I'll start my story with WikidPad.  Lives here <a href="http://www.jhorman.org/wikidPad/">www.jhorman.org/wikidPad</a> <br>  Under Windows and under Linux it feels normal.  About the money does not ask - open course.  Written on python and this is the reason for its system omnivorous. <br>  The editor is implemented according to the principle and likeness of the wiki. <br>  Word links are created automatically if the set is conducted in the CamelCase style (several words are written together, each with a capital letter), <br>  to force the creation of a connection, it is enough to take the necessary word in square brackets.  If the definition of the word exists, the link will be highlighted in blue, if not, the link will remain black and at any time by clicking on it, you can proceed to the definition of a new wiki word. <br>  Of the convenience, there are tabs Edit and Preview - a very elegant way without too much trouble to view the source code of the page or its appearance with formatting. <br>  On the left there is a window with a hierarchy of elements of the document.  Of course, this can be a daunting effect on a simple user, but for a person tempted by modern IDE tools this is a good help, especially since the hierarchy has very useful information about the document being edited, and all the current settings of the editor and wiki file. <br>  For the transfer, it is possible to export a wiki file into a single html or a set of html files in each of which one word is defined. <br><br>  - Wiki on a stick.  Wiki in itself <br>  That never ceases to amaze the diversity and wit open source! <br>  This little masterpiece was excavated on a tip from the Linux Format magazine, for which a special thanks to him. <br>  The project lives here <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php%3Fgroup_id%3D155218">sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=155218</a> . <br>  It is a wiki system implemented right inside a single html.  All you need to work with it is a browser and included Java Script.  Thus, cross-platform is provided.  Portability and portability too.  And this despite the fact that the functionality of the wiki-essence does not suffer.  Even 256-bit encryption is built for closed wiki pages.  You can edit and create new wiki words, delete, even embed java script - toys! <br>  The transfer is elementary - just send the html-file to the addressee, and he can edit it by opening it in a simple browser. <br>  True, the project is still in beta, but this is temporary.  Try recommending, maybe someone will tell ideas for personal projects. <br><br>  - I have an idea?  Go to the library!  ADB Idea Library for your PDA <br>  In fact, this is not a wiki but a hierarchical way of storing information and the ability to use links to already existing sections within the database make ADB Idea Library a good tool for keeping records of ideas on a pocket pc.  The system is free.  Available here <a href="http://www.happyjackroad.net/idea3/idea3.asp">www.happyjackroad.net/idea3/idea3.asp</a> .  Unfortunately, it was not updated for a long time.  But its current functionality is enough for the eyes. <br>  Ideas can be sketched (although the internal format for storing images is apparently bit-wise, the base swells significantly when images are abused), you can write text, you can create an idea as a task that synchronizes with the windows mobile task list.  Again, you can create a shortcut to an idea written in another section of the database.  Accordingly, you can create folders with the help of which it is more convenient to categorize ideas.  There is also a dekstop version of this program, though unfortunately only in the version for windows (the desktop hasn‚Äôt been useful to me yet - I‚Äôm working around the mobile version of the program) <br><br>  Well, that's all. <br>  If you have questions - ask in the comments. <br><br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/17325/">https://habr.com/ru/post/17325/</a></p>
