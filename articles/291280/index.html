It so happened that for the last year I have been working in the same organizations with access to the ‚Äúkitchen‚Äù, and in two more, I look through the keyhole.  Naturally, it is very difficult to keep such a pace, gradually completing activities in two projects and, finally, I‚Äôll stop at one organization. <br><br><h5>  <b>How it all began for me</b> </h5><br>  2011, I am in search of work.  Behind shoulders experience in various areas where the work was physical.  It was not necessary to work with the head, it even harmed the performance of basic duties. <br><br>  He came to the interview at the lowest position with the appropriate salary.  My knowledge and experience of past work here was useless.  A person was required to work at a computer with at least minimal knowledge of the office and at least some experience using the Internet.  At that time, my skills allowed me to reinstall the OS using the manuals found on the network.  Rich experience of sitting in the social.  networks, hundreds of gigabytes of downloaded porn and Wikipedia reading for understanding new words - this is the whole set, at least as related to the list of requirements.  In a word, I didn‚Äôt have even minimal knowledge.

      Passed  Basic knowledge of mathematics and my requirements for salary helped (who knew that there is a difference between wages in the IT sphere and earnings in a different world). <br><br>  It's time to learn.  A small briefing, the task is set - the task is done.  Main assistants: Google search engine and attention to what is happening around.  After 2-3 months, the combat unit called "sales manager" is ready.  All that further, a set of experience. <br><br>  Due to the predominance of the necessary to perform, on the possible to perform - it was always boring, I learned a lot of interesting things. <br><br>  Three years later, the need and the opportunity to earn some extra money led to a similar office for remote work, then another.  This allowed to realize interesting ideas where they were interested in.  That's how we live. <br><br><h5>  <b>About affiliate programs</b> </h5><br>  I guess not everyone understands that we are talking about casino affiliate programs, perhaps not everyone knows what it is all about. <br><br>  <i>An affiliate program</i> is one of the ways of interaction between the provider of a product or service and a partner who receives a reward for advertising. <br><br>  <i>A casino partner</i> is a casino here and is a commodity for which a partner usually receives a certain percentage of the loss of a client brought by him. <br><br>  * Further in the text using the word <i>affiliate</i> program, an affiliate program working with a casino will be implied. <br><br>  For example, you make jeans, they lie, no one buys them for a reason: no one knows what you have.  You hire a person who will advertise them.  Went advertising, sales began.  And here comes the idea, but what if you organize the work of any number of advertisers, so that they work for a certain reward from the sale.  More sold - got more.  It did not work out to sell - what can you do, another time it will turn out, nobody forced you.  This is how an affiliate program is created, where everyone can come and try to sell your jeans. <br><br>  ... there is a competitor with other, green, jeans.  They are bought better.  Another PP appears, where everything is organized, just come and advertise, etc. <br><br>  There are various options to increase your income.  Improve the quality of the product, improve the advertising materials without improving the product, attract more advertisers with gifts, reduce the share of advertisers, and whatever your heart desires.  Everyone chooses their own business plan, each with their own goals and their own methods of achieving them. <br><br>  <i>Most affiliate programs, sooner or later, are trying to do their best in attracting players - this is its growth.</i>  <i>Since this gives a predictable influx of traffic.</i>  <i>Partners are not constant, there are enough competitors, many factors are not under control.</i>  <i>Arbitrage, email marketing, SMM, SEO, any direction of advertising can form a department.</i>  <i>Cheaper and more stability in keeping professionals on hand.</i>  <i>The main disadvantage is that they may not be such experts.</i> <br><br>  By and large, hire customers to work.  Not certainly in that way.  Hire all the same advertisers, only those do not know that you can work through the affiliate yourself.  Either they know, but they should work on a permanent basis for a stable salary. <br><br>  This approach is half of the affiliate countries of the CIS.  The rest divide the second half into those who work in their own way, and into those who practice the foreign approach. <br><br>  <i>The realities of the market make their adjustments to any business plan.</i>  <i>Affiliate managers are engaged in drawing promo, if there are not enough designers, designers do layout, if there are not enough layout designers, layout designers communicate with the client ... Someone will be surprised now and say ‚Äúoh, I didn‚Äôt know that this is a job for three positions, I‚Äôve always done this alone‚Äù .</i>  <i>Someone will say "why did you write this, we now have a manager, designer and layout designer asking for an increase in salary".</i>  <i>All cases are individual.</i>  <i>Now I don‚Äôt know what I wanted to say and what I‚Äôm leading to; a new look has appeared on some things.</i>  <i>Now I see less and less differences with any other business - money is the engine of progress ...</i> <br><br>  All are far from the chosen path to create PP.  They get off on the road, then they throw all their partners away, they deceive them - it‚Äôs impossible to keep the brand. <br><br><h6>  <b>Affiliate Competition</b> </h6><br>  This is the main impetus for development and an inexhaustible source of ideas.  Do not remember the day when and who first began to borrow everything ready. <br><br>  <i>Urgently need a banner!</i>  <i>- Here, hold, here the logo is not yet ours, now we will fix it.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Here is the new landing page.</i>  <i>- Have you ever changed your links to yours?</i> <br><br>  More interesting things, too, love to present.  DDOS attacks, DB lead, abuzit everything.  The more interesting the gift, the more reasons for personal meetings and clarification of further actions.  After all, almost all live nearby, they know each other.  Similar things kind of invitation to a family dinner. <br><br><h6>  Legality </h6><br>  Why legally?  In some CIS countries is prohibited by law online casinos. <br>  Can there be an illegal business?  Of course not.  If there is, it means legal and nothing else.  All that outlaw eradicated. <br><br>  The ways to achieve legality are different, but they all work to one degree or another.  I hope everyone remembers in which country they live. <br>  If there is a failure in the approach of legalizing business, certain structures come in and begin to find out legally or not legally. <br>  - Now is legal, continue to work, have a good day (I exaggerate, but the meaning is clear). <br><br><h5>  <b>Arbitrage and work with partners</b> </h5><br>  In which I work, these are all domestic affiliate programs.  Everybody has the same skeleton in their inner work.  What do the managers do - everything, to a greater extent that does not apply to PP.  Therefore, they are able and know a lot of things, but this knowledge is mostly superficial.  At best, with a larger state, they can focus some on one direction.  Even in this case, it will be anything - but not work with partners. <br><br>  <i>For comparison with foreign software (working with the CIS).</i>  <i>The manager focuses on working with clients.</i>  <i>He is the link between the affiliate and the client.</i>  <i>His income depends entirely on the success of the client, he is interested in the fact that the client can work effectively.</i>  <i>Surprisingly, this scheme works better.</i>  <i>The point is not only in this difference, but in combination with other factors gives a good result.</i> <br><br>  But we have what we have.  The manager is mainly engaged in arbitration.  In such a situation, it is much easier to convert traffic into a plus.  The layer is being erased - PP, which would take half of the income if you were a partner.  Major market players offer 40-60% of revenue.  Therefore, not many arbitrageurs are able to work with gambling themes through the affiliate program. <br><br>  <i>Have you ever come across the question of ‚Äúname the source of traffic‚Äù in working with software?</i>  <i>Only in the domestic affiliate response can play you no good.</i>  <i>If managers can repeat / copy your way of attracting a player, they will do this and will compete with you.</i>  <i>Remember the advantage of ~ 50%?</i> <br><br>  This will not happen: <br>  - if they already work in this segment <br>  - if you can not do that, and you <br>  - if it brings a small income <br>  - if they are not engaged in similar plagiarism <br><br>  <i>In foreign affiliate programs this question is asked in order to prepare a promo for your needs, to promote better attraction of players.</i> <br><br>  Do not worry, all the same work managers enough without it. <br>  Not all the terrible things described are used by all affiliates, but they have a place.  In this case, it is rather a temporary phenomenon than the rule. <br><br>  <i>If you see new pitfalls in work with affiliates, do not worry, nothing has changed from whether you know it or not.</i>  <i>No one will tell you that this is the case.</i>  <i>All worked in these conditions and continue to work.</i>  <i>Not all things occur in one PP, and those that occur are not necessarily constant.</i> <br><br><h5>  <b>Separately about email marketing</b> </h5><br>  Given the fact that email is the information that is collected absolutely all casinos.  This is the first information that the casino receives about the player.  Despite this, all email marketing is in the <s>ass</s> in a deplorable state - this is at best.  For some, no one deals with mailing. <br><br>  I have not met an affiliate program that does not have problems in this area.  But many try to spam on the sly, and if they suddenly hacked the database of competitors, they didn‚Äôt do it themselves, so they bought it - a holiday! <br><br><h6>  Mailing and Mailing Services </h6><br>  Separately, I note that it remains to be desired in the fight against spam, both the first and second. <br>  The same goes for the delivery of normal mailings.  The algorithms are so perfect that their intersections with each other in the definition of spam or not have erased the boundaries long ago. <br>  The most adequate, more often than others, postal service in this regard, is Gmeil. <br><br><h5>  <b>A few words about Shaving</b> </h5><br>  Surely you heard about the lake with the monster ‚ÄúShaving‚Äù dwelling in it, which no one saw. <br><br>  Despite the fact that on the Internet there are so many different areas working with money.  Which, in one way or another, commit frauds with your money, the word ‚ÄúShaving‚Äù has been so entrenched in the affiliate program that it is an integral part of it.  That's all. <br><br>  I'd rather write a ‚Äútestimony of the canary‚Äù than continue to develop this topic. <br><br>  In most cases, these statistics are formed on the side of the affiliate.  Sometimes on a third-party service. <br>  Of course, no one ever distorts or hides the data.  Especially when you consider the specifics of this area. <br><br><h6>  Raise the curtain </h6><br>  In the following lines, one affiliate program will be clearly visible, but I cannot describe it. <br><br>  Everyone has seen ads when a new product comes out, a new version, and the like.  It is said: "twice as much", "ten times more tasty" and in the same spirit.  Always perceived like, as anti-advertising of the previous product.  It can be assumed that he was "two times less", "ten times more disgusting" from the statements in the new advertisement. <br><br>  Why am I leading?  Sometimes affiliate programs make statements when they have changes, make improvements, maybe they describe their differences over others.  Some of these statements are very interesting. <br><br>  One of the affiliate companies has officially announced that they will pick up old players.  <i>For those who understand, no matter what the next words will be</i> .  They in turn offered a larger percentage and other ‚Äúprivileges‚Äù.  Naturally, this contributed to the outflow, insignificant, webmasters to other affiliate program.  Even some large customers have broken this hook.  By the way, only from such, is already a good plus in your pocket. <br><br>  But in the affiliate program they knew what they were doing.  According to calculations, they will receive more income in a shorter period of time.  When the earnings will not be satisfied again, we will need solutions to change the situation, I am sure they will throw out the piece no worse (they have some experience). <br><br>  <i>For a long time did not understand why they did so, this is insanity.</i>  <i>How can an affiliate casino pick up players?</i>  <i>This is also the basis of gambling, the main difference with other software.</i> <br><br>  Such a scheme cannot please the partners, but it‚Äôs not for the sake of them that everything is done. <br><br>  And yet, what am I leading to.  If affiliate programs make statements, even if using this example, this does not mean that they haven‚Äôt taken the players before or will stop doing this.  And this does not mean that similar things do not happen in other affiliate programs, only not so openly.  What should we learn from this?  No need to summarize all the affiliate program, but do not lose sight of important things. <br><br><h5>  <b>Scam?</b> </h5><br>  There is a form of advertising, for getting money not from the players, through the ways of earning money in the casino (martingale, programs, etc.).  So, this is just an advertisement for getting money not from players. <br><br>  <i>When I myself was led to something like this, then this experience cost me $ 40. With the fact that I poured 20 once, I poured it in another 20 time and also poured it.</i>  <i>But that‚Äôs not what stopped me.</i>  <i>There was still 20 dollars.</i> <br><br><h5>  <b>Employers and all who left</b> </h5><br>  For the former, in spite of the competition factor, no data was transmitted or used in the work. <br>  For the latter, all information is fictional and has no relation to reality. <br><br><h5>  <i>Summarizing</i> </h5><br>  This is one of the leaders in gambling in the CIS market.  Since these methods work, it means that it is impossible to work in a different way in our realities in order to achieve leading positions, especially to preserve them. <br><br>  PS The name "bloody" used for better CTR. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/291280/">https://habr.com/ru/post/291280/</a></p>
