It was published in 1986 in the golden age of microcomputers, and contains interviews with individuals like Dan Bricklin (VisiCalc), Gary Kildal (CP / M), and even Bill Gates (at the time when he was a hacker and main author of Microsoft BASIC) . <br><br>  The interview with Gates is certainly very exciting, but a conversation with Jeff Raskin, the creator of the Apple Macintosh project, can get your attention much more.  Ruskin in it criticizes Steve Jobs himself! <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1ba/ac0/cce/1baac0cce0850225b38f2fd15b3b3eab.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Lately, more and more conversations are going around Jobs's personality and his contribution to the company: that the new vision of the company and the revival of Apple began thanks to his unique ideas and developments, that Apple, if you will, is Jobs's toy and all products coming from the company are his merit, grown out of his hobbies.  There was a general opinion that Jobs' vision became the driving force of Macs.

      This could be true, and we all think so, but Raskin said that everything is not quite so.  That is literally what he said in his interview in that <i>distant 1986 year</i> .  (excerpts from pages 229 to 231): <br><br><blockquote>  <i>When I offered to make a computer [Mac] that is easy to use, combines text and graphics and will sell for about $ 1,000, Jobs called my idea crazy that we can never sell it and we don‚Äôt need anything like that.</i>  <i>He tried to close the project.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>So I left Jobs away and went to the then chairman of the board, Mike Marcula, to discuss the details of my idea.</i>  <i>Fortunately, he and the then-president of the company, Mike Scott, told Jobs not to bother me.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>We went to another building and built prototypes of the Macintosh and its software, and after receiving approval we gave a move to the project.</i>  <i>[...] We tried to keep our project from Steve's intervention.</i>  <i>For the first two years, Jobs wanted to ‚Äúkill‚Äù him because he did not understand what we were actually trying to create.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>If Jobs wanted to get a loan for what he did for the industry, he would hardly get much.</i>  <i>But it turns out that he is assigned the merits of the rest, which is very regrettable.</i>  <i>I was very amused by what he said in a recent Newsweek article: "I still have a couple of new projects for the future."</i>  <i>But he never had any projects.</i>  <i>He did not develop anything concrete.</i>  <i>Woz (Steve Wozniak) developed the Apple II.</i>  <i>Ken Rothm√ºller and the rest did Lisa.</i>  <i>I developed my Mac with my team.</i>  <i>Wendell Sanders made the Apple III.</i>  <i>What did Jobs do?</i>  <i>Nothing.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Jobs‚Äôs only contribution to the Macintosh project was that he was unsuccessfully trying to cancel it.</i> </blockquote><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bb0/c55/071/bb0c55071233dd52c4d53535b9a659b7.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Now, hardly anyone can tell how much this is true.  We do not know enough about the history of Apple to form our own opinion and determine where the truth is and where the fiction is.  It is also worth emphasizing that this interview was done <u>24 years ago</u> , and it is likely that Ruskin‚Äôs opinion has changed by the time of his death in 2005.  Nevertheless, for many it was a big surprise to read about such a diametrically opposite opinion about the history of Apple from the mouth of one of the key players in the history of the company. <br><br>  via <a href="http://reprog.wordpress.com/2010/09/06/steve-jobs-never-had-any-designs-he-has-not-designed-a-single-project/">The Reinvigorated Programmer</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/103803/">https://habr.com/ru/post/103803/</a></p>
