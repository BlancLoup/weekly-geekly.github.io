Team, responsibility, courage, trust ... <br><br><h4>  Investor </h4><br><br>  Investors do not care what process is used in software development.  He needs profit, as much as possible and faster.  And money, as we know, does not smell.  He wants to pay off the invested penny.

      If it doesn't work, he will sell the whole company with the team, giblets and processes to the one who pays the most.  And let everyone get fired at the company after that, he doesn't care. <br><br><h4>  Project manager </h4><br><br>  He needs a project: <br><br>  a) It was fairly accurately described, agreed with the Customer and the requirements did not change.  Then it is easy to evaluate, plan the stages of work and waterfall to perform. <br><br>  b) What kind of relationship in the development team - Edgail there or the Gestapo with daily dismemberment - he does not give a damn.  Progress on the project should be stages to surrender in certain terms. <br><br>  Then the manager can stutter about salary increase, hint to the chief about career growth.  As soon as he is given the opportunity to leave for a highly paid prestigious job, he will do it, because the future leader will unconsciously fight for power and look up. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Development Manager </h4><br><br>  These guys dream that the Customer together with the project manager (cross out the right one) does not change the requirements, or does it rarely - because  it is difficult and expensive to make changes to the written and tested code in the middle of the process. <br><br>  Colleagues do not want specialists - developers, layout designers, designers, testers - to be able to smanit easily by offering 5 tr.  more.  To do this, employees will be given a metered play in new technologies to feel their involvement in the beautiful. <br><br>  If the processes are not set, the project documentation is not kept, that is, there is a risk that a leader will appear in the team who will lead it to another company.  In this case, the above colleagues are likely to be fired.  Therefore, a search and shooting is done through the dismissal / substitution of such potential competitors. <br><br>  Perhaps, only in this case, the development management will need edgail, as a competitive advantage - we have a humane process, a team, and if you leave the company, you will be blacks and IT plumbers. <br><br>  However, if the process is set, everything is documented, ISO / CMM or sustainable business processes - then, for the sake of efficiency, people can be fired and changed like gloves, with any deviation - the projects will not stop, new business process staff will quickly go through the courses and take place of the departed.  Those.  humanity is no longer needed. <br><br><h4>  Specialist (developer, etc.) </h4><br><br>  A person wants comfort at work, communication with colleagues, especially women (active communication).  I want to avoid personal responsibility (the entire team is responsible for everything).  Go to work and hang out.  I would like to choose which tasks to do, and which ones not, and evaluate it myself (Planning Poker). <br><br>  And the leader (scrum master) is Jesus Christ with a staff ‚Äî a mentor, does not fight, does not swear at obscenities, only teaches and develops.  Heaven on earth! <br><br>  This is where humane development methodologies are perfect :-). <br><br>  But.  If a specialist wants to grow into a development manager, technical development manager, project manager - he and the team and the atmosphere of tusn√≠ are no longer on the way.  He is single handed.  He is the future leader / expert.  Therefore, it will stand out among others, even humiliate them to enhance contrast.  Whether he will become a manager in this humane company is unlikely, but in another ... why not. <br><br><h4>  Edgeyle in the style of the Gestapo </h4><br><br>  Sometimes IT-managers who perceive flexible methodologies as a means of squeezing all the juices from engineering teams come across.  Scheduled sex several times a day.  Still, daily planning meetings, open space, a specialist cannot fall for a couple of days, live on forums, read technology news.  Stand-ups, intensive assault tasks, pair programming, demonstrations.  People in the team are aging rapidly, the nervous system is destroyed by the effect of life behind glass - but projects go ahead, features are being made. <br><br>  And here we come to the topic of ‚Äúsulfuric‚Äù beekeeping :-).  When breeding bees, there are roughly two strategies - humane and cruel. <br><br>  When humane, the bee family, after harvesting honey, is left in the summer for the winter and until the next season.  At the same time, that the bees overwinter, they leave 10-20 kilograms of honey to feed. <br><br>  When fierce - the bee family after harvest ... persecuted with sulfur.  Why?  They do not need to leave tens of kilograms of honey for the winter, but it can be sold.  And with the money they earn, they buy a new family in the spring and so on :-) <br><br>  And they do this quite often with people - they catch up with a bunch of programmers, treat them like cattle, they write a bunch of crap, then they dismiss particularly smart people and just to have fun, they hire new ones and so on. <br><br>  Yes, we, as experts, understand that the system will be born in such an inhuman process, that the house of brain tolerance will be the code, that the system will collapse in convulsions in a couple of years. <br><br>  How to convey to the ‚Äúpowerful people‚Äù that it is for profit that you first need to give people the opportunity to open up, realize themselves, not leave the company for 5-10 years, be proud of their projects, their code? <br><br>  Or maybe it is a communist utopia and the struggle for the freedom of programmers?  So who benefits from humane methodologies?  :-) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/121087/">https://habr.com/ru/post/121087/</a></p>
