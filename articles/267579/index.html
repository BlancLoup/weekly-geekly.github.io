      Book: <b>"The Art of Capacity Planning"</b> <br>  Posted by: John Allpaw <br><br>  John has extensive experience in the development of engineering systems.  He was involved in creating teams for managing network infrastructure, planning the development of storage systems for large-scale projects, ensuring high availability, as well as data recovery after failures. <br><br>  The book is devoted to practical planning and capacity management of Internet projects.  You will learn how to use real tools and adapt to changes in the load on the website, which will increase over time.  The book covers capacity planning processes for developing websites, including data collection, procurement and deployment of components, as well as some popular and time-tested measurement tools and methods. <br><br>  How is the back-end scaled?  How many visitors can the system serve per hour?  What to do with the increase in the number of visitors doubled?  When you need to buy servers, how many they need and what should they be?  How to justify the cost of equipment?  All these questions inevitably arise when the Internet project is gaining popularity.  As examples, the book describes practical solutions used in Flickr.  The fundamentals of capacity planning given here are universal and suitable for any Internet resources. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0ad/0e3/0d2/0ad0e30d2a964e0dbb0e5cc2b825b385.jpg"><br><br>  Book: <b>The Art of Unix Programming</b> <br>  Author: Eric Raymond <br><br>  Eric Raymond is widely known in the Open Source community as one of his ideologues.
