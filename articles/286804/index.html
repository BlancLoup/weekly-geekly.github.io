      The Master provides for a deeper, in contrast to the Undergraduate, the development of the theory of the chosen specialty and, depending on the profile, the preparation of the student for research or professional activity. <br>  Masters programs last, as a rule, one year.  Individual programs sometimes take two years. <br><br>  The uniqueness of the magistracy in the UK is that it provides an opportunity to master a new specialty that is not related to the undergraduate program.  The Master's program involves the study of 15-20 subjects that are directly related to the direction of the diploma.  Thus, for 1 year you get a fairly intensive program, which will save time and money.  However, such a rapid pace of study may come as a surprise to foreign students and requires a Pre-Master's course, which is available in almost every university in England. <br><br>  International students have the right to work while studying in the UK for no more than 15 hours per week.  The average hourly wage of students is 5-7 pounds.  Any university in the UK has sufficient links with companies that offer students a part-time job while studying. <br><br>  At the end of the master‚Äôs program students are awarded a degree depending on the chosen specialization: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Postgraduate Certificate in Education, PC CE (postgraduate certificate giving the right to teach); <br>  ‚Ä¢ Diploma in Management Studies, DMS (Diploma in Management); <br>  ‚Ä¢ Master of Arts, MA (Master of Arts); <br>  ‚Ä¢ Master of Science, MSc (Master of Science); <br>  ‚Ä¢ Master of Business Administration, MBA (Master of Business Administration); <br>  ‚Ä¢ Master of Law, LLM (Master of Law). <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">Entry Requirements</font> </h2><br>  Depending on the university, admission requirements may vary.  Of course, the higher the university in the ranking, the higher the competition awaits you. <br><br>  So, the selection committee is waiting for you: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ certificate of knowledge of the English language - IELTS (note that TOEFL is not accepted since 2014); <br>  ‚Ä¢ GMAT or GRE certificate (usually for technical, financial and economic specialties); <br>  ‚Ä¢ essay (answers to the questions proposed in the application form); <br>  ‚Ä¢ CV (CV); <br>  ‚Ä¢ 2 letters of recommendation (academic references); <br>  ‚Ä¢ a diploma of higher education equivalent to an English undergraduate (transcript). <br><br>  Even more information about the requirements for admission in the article <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/education/magistratura-za-rubezhom-shag-za-shagom/">"Master's degree abroad, step by step</a> . <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/education/magistratura-za-rubezhom-shag-za-shagom/">"</a> <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">Preparation for admission</font> </h2><br>  Preparation for admission must begin one year before the end of the bachelor's degree (that is, in the third year) in order to start studying at the master's level immediately after graduation.  In addition, preparation for tests takes a long time and it is desirable to properly plan this process. <br><br>  <a href="http://ielts-test.ru/">IELTS</a> (International English Language Testing System) - an exam to determine the level of English proficiency in people for whom it is not native.  Depending on the candidate‚Äôs goals, there are two exam modules: General and Academic.  They differ in tasks in the sections Reading and Writing.  For admission to the magistracy will need to pass Academic IELTS.  The required score for admission to the magistracy in England from 6.5 and above.  More information about the format of the test and preparation can be found in <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/search.php%3Ftags%3DIELTS">our blog</a> . <br><br>  <a href="http://www.mbaconsult.ru/ru/GRE/">GRE</a> (Graduate Record Examinations) - a standardized exam in English, which is one of the necessary conditions for admission to foreign postgraduate programs and courses (MSc, MBA, PhD, etc.).  There are two types of exam: GRE General Test (general) and GRE Subject Test (specialized). <br><br>  GRE General Test is designed to assess critical thinking and analytical skills in general.  If, for admission to a university, it is necessary to demonstrate knowledge of a particular subject, an examination is required in one of the following areas: biochemistry, cellular and molecular biology, biology, chemistry, computer science, English-language literature, mathematics, physics and psychology.  However, the GRE General is most often required for admission. <br>  Learn more about the GRE test and its counterpart, the <a href="http://gmat-test.ru/">GMAT</a> test, <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/search.php%3Ftags%3DGRE">here</a> . <br><br>  You can prepare for the tests on courses, individually with a tutor and independently.  The latter option is only suitable for those who have a high level of language and good self-discipline.  In the other two we recommend contacting teachers with experience in passing and working with tests for at least 3-5 years. <br><br>  All documents, including test results, are attached to the application form on the university website and are submitted to the deadline. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e13/5ff/433/e135ff43329d42cf9bcd77f8d05c8932.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">Cost of education</font> </h2><br>  The highest cost of training in a magistracy in England - in universities, with the highest position in the ranking of universities.  As a rule, the cost of a magistracy in English universities for programs whose study does not require laboratory equipment in universities that are below the 50th position in the ranking does not exceed ¬£ 11,000. <br><br>  At Oxford Unisersity, tuition will be ¬£ 18,550, LSE - ¬£ 24,456, Lancaster - ¬£ 17,000.  Do not forget about the cost of living, it is still about 10,000 pounds sterling. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">Grants and scholarships</font> </h2><br>  We have repeatedly talked about grants and scholarships to study abroad, so we recall once more those that are suitable for paying tuition in England. <br><br>  So pay attention to the following programs: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ <a href="http://www.chevening.org/">Chevening Scholarships</a> - British system of grants for training talented students with leadership skills.  Student support is sponsored by the British government and provides free education and development opportunities in British universities.  Everything is paid, from flight to accommodation and meals; <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ <a href="http://eacea.ec.europa.eu/erasmus_mundus/results_compendia/selected_projects_action_1_master_courses_en.php">Erasmus Mundus</a> - a program that pays for not only tuition, but also accommodation, food, and even flight.  But it is impossible to choose a higher education institution independently, it will be one of 10‚Äì12 universities in Europe, and not always prestigious and iconic, but it may be lucky to get to Oxford; <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ <a href="http://educationglobal.ru/">Global Education</a> - Russian program to finance students who independently enroll in foreign universities.  More than 200 universities in 27 countries are already participating in the program.  The program finances not only education, but also accommodation abroad. <br><br>  <i>We hope that our article was interesting and useful to you.</i>  <i>Next time we will talk about the magistracy in Germany.</i> <br><br>  Translated by Vyacheslav Davidenko, founder of <a href="http://www.mbaconsult.ru/">MBA Consult</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/286804/">https://habr.com/ru/post/286804/</a></p>
