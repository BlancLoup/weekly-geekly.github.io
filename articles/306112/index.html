The main goal is to cope with the growth of problem orders by standardizing functional responsibilities and the subsequent implementation of a CRM system. <br><br>  The past in the face of sysadminstvo left an imprint and predisposition in favor of OpenSource, and the need to save money when using it was also a significant factor. <br><br>  I have reviewed various systems: EspoCRM, SuiteCRM and other opensource crm, as well as commercial ones, such as Bitrix24.

      Key factors in choosing were: <br><ul><li>  Integration with Asterisk </li><li>  Workflows with designer </li><li>  Email marketing </li></ul><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  All the systems considered did not meet these criteria or the cost of subscription fees for the functionality, or the need to use an additional service (mailchimp, etc.). <br><br>  I do not know how, but I came across <a href="http://www.x2crm.com/">X2CRM</a> . <br><br>  The list of functions for many CRM is typical, but I will consider those functions that caught my eye. <br><ul><li>  Email marketing </li><li>  Graphic Designer Workflows </li><li>  Simple constructor of its "entities", modules in understanding X2CRM </li></ul><br><h4>  Email marketing </h4><br>  The first thing that had the WOW effect on me was when I received a notification in CRM about an open letter with a ‚Äúcontact‚Äù (of course, I created a test contact card with my own data and sent him a letter using CRM).  Moreover, subsequent testing showed that the fixation of the opening is not only when the contact has opened the letter in the web version, as well as via the IMAP protocol. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/10a/16c/233/10a16c2330e849b1b469d7bcbceb2170.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The second functionality that struck me is a fully featured mailing system that allows you to: <br><ul><li>  filter recipients by all existing fields in the customer card </li><li>  see the number of open letters (both in general and in the context of each recipient) </li><li>  see the number of clicks on the links (in general and in the context of each recipient, implemented through a redirect) </li><li>  unsubscribe to contact from the subsequent distribution </li><li>  use attributes of type {firstName} in templates </li></ul><br><br>  In the screenshot below, 0 out of 0, because my email has already been marked as refusing to send letters. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a1c/23a/69a/a1c23a69a5ec4ed683cf267787a83b00.png" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Graphic Designer Workflows </h4><br>  For efficient work in CRM, besides the client card, deals and ‚Äúleads,‚Äù automation is very necessary. <br>  It can be in any form and, say, it can do such things: <br><br><ul><li>  notify the client of the completion of a particular transaction by email </li><li>  automatically create a task manager when creating a new contact </li><li>  and a bunch of other uses </li></ul><br>  The use of such automation allows both to simplify the interaction with the client, and to automate the work of managers, respond to calls, etc. <br><br>  The company that oversees the development of X2CRM, in the spring of this year, the designer transferred Workflows from the paid distribution model to OpenSource.  And I can say that this process designer is currently the most visually accessible and simple. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/59e/6f8/ea7/59e6f8ea7f40bfb90c772844b49a3f3c.png" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Module constructor </h4><br>  The built-in module designer allows you to create your own ‚Äúentity‚Äù for your business, link dependencies with standard modules, reassign existing fields and visually build a form to fill out and present the module. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/29d/6b0/64f/29d6b064fcaf4d7a93396084aaab450f.png" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  What else do you have </h4><br><ul><li>  Android client who understands your new modules </li><li>  The ability to import / export of finished modules, individual fields </li><li>  Reporting, graphics </li><li>  API </li><li>  WEB forms </li></ul><br><br><h4>  What is it implemented on? </h4><br>  PHP (Yii 1), MySQL.  There should be no problems with hosting and customization. <br><br><h4>  Existing problems </h4><br>  Translation - absent.  What is now is a translation using Google Translate. <br>  At the moment I am engaged in translation here: <a href="https://github.com/Pomazan-Bogdan/X2CRM-ru">github.com/Pomazan-Bogdan/X2CRM-ru</a> <br><br>  Developer reaction rate is very low.  The forum is answered very rarely, at the moment the bug reports via github have not yet been implemented.  All this is connected both with a small number of active developers, and with the fact that the development model is being rebuilt (transfer to github, integration with Travis CI). <br><br>  Community, especially Russian - is absent. <br><br><h4>  Why this publication? </h4><br>  I found a very good tool for myself and I see that it can help many people to cover their questions.  In the Russian-speaking segment of the Internet there is absolutely no information about this CRM.  I want to find "like-minded people" who will want to promote this system and jointly refine their needs (translation, telephony). <br><br><h4>  Links </h4><br>  Website: <a href="http://x2crm.com/">x2crm.com</a> <br>  Forum: <a href="http://community.x2crm.com/">community.x2crm.com</a> <br>  GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/X2Engine/X2CRM">github.com/X2Engine/X2CRM</a> <br>  My translation: <a href="https://github.com/Pomazan-Bogdan/X2CRM-ru">github.com/Pomazan-Bogdan/X2CRM-ru</a> <br>  Mobile client: <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.x2crm.x2crm">play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.x2crm.x2crm</a> <br>  Demo: <a href="http://demo.x2crm.com/index.php/site/login">demo.x2crm.com/index.php/site/login</a> <br>  Telegram group: <a href="https://telegram.me/x2crm">https://telegram.me/x2crm</a> <br><br>  <i>Thank you for your attention</i> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/306112/">https://habr.com/ru/post/306112/</a></p>
