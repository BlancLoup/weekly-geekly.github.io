      <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/easy/">Easy</a> is a multifunctional plugin that makes it easy and convenient to customize the layout of content blocks on a page.  At the same time it is not necessary to understand HTML and CSS.  The site page is assembled from ‚Äúbricks‚Äù, which simply move to the necessary places.  The main ‚Äúbuilding blocks‚Äù of content are: title, text, images, categories, tags, comments, author, shortcode, date, etc. You can also change the page composition by moving its logical blocks, such as the number of posts per page, type of publications , various filters, etc. <br><a name="habracut"></a>  Thanks to the ease and speed of creating page layouts, you can quickly test various options for arranging content items, determining what works best.  By changing the design, we can improve the usability of the resource, which plays a significant role in the ranking algorithm.  The easier it is to find the necessary information, the more time the user spends on the site and the more active he performs, the better it affects behavioral metrics. <br><br><h4>  UpToLike Share Buttons </h4><br>  <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/uptolike-share/">UpToLike Share Buttons</a> - Russified plugin social <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/uptolike-share/">network</a> buttons, which also collects statistics on social behavior on the site.  With UpToLike it is more convenient to work on social metrics, because the plugin helps to attract more traffic from social networks, increase the number of subscribers to public and groups, and increase the sharing rate on sites.  How it works? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d4b/4ba/fbb/d4b4bafbba2240e985c47ba63e39220d.png"><br><br>  Firstly, thanks to the buttons themselves: they are customized to fit any style of the site, they can be of any shape, color, size, and located anywhere on the page.  There is just a lot of opportunities to customize the buttons "for yourself" and watch what works best. <br><br>  Secondly, there are several special chips that greatly facilitate the process of sharing.  For example, the option "Citations": the user selects a section in the text and is invited to share it on his social network page.  Very handy thing for especially lazy.  Noticeable are the buttons sharing, which rotate clockwise or increase with hover.  "Trifle", but also can work on the growth of sharinga. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/33b/b05/02d/33bb0502dacc465da6d9e0860ca4c2f0.png"><br><br>  The third point is the follower.  It is configured like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/273/5da/ebe/2735daebef00427a9ed3a481fbcfa69d.png"><br><br>  You can design an invitation to join the group or subscribe.  A little imagination - and you can use the invitation to receive 10-20-30 new subscribers per day, without doing almost anything for this. <br><br>  Finally, the fourth point is the statistics of social behavior of users on the site, which includes likes, balloons, followers, statistics on attracting new users from social networks, splitting traffic on social networks, and so on. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1db/eba/873/1dbeba8735e342269eb21d82a29ee19b.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f1e/912/468/f1e91246886d46f7a157bbc11cfb1dcb.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c50/69c/851/c5069c8512664c7a9b522772ed18aa56.png"><br><br>  <b>What can you do with such statistics?</b> <br>  First, understand the effectiveness of social action.  If huskies and balloons do not bring new users to the site - what's the point?  And if they do, how can they bring more people from social networks with their help? <br>  Secondly, to know exactly what the audience of social networks like on the site most of all and give them exactly that, but in greater numbers. <br>  Third, make regular selections of the most popular // discussed materials. <br>  Fourthly, every 3-6 months to repeat the repost of popular articles in social networks (during this time, social network visitors for the most part will deeply forget that ‚Äúsomething is already flashed in the tape,‚Äù and you can get another one for the same materials salvo traffic). <br>  Fifth, follow a follow up: you change something in the invitation window, and you see right away whether it works or not. <br><br><h4>  All in One Schema.org Rich Snippets </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/753/cfb/a3d/753cfba3d551400293b38716e079f3d2.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c5d/d68/aae/c5dd68aaecaa4d4bbc37bc3cdf7754d3.png"><br><br>  As the name implies, the <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/all-in-one-schemaorg-rich-snippets/">All in One Schema.org Rich Snippets plugin</a> helps you quickly and conveniently create advanced snippets (information about the website and business in a concise form that search engines display in the results).  Depending on the specifics of a business, target audience, UTP and other parameters, a snippet may include ratings, links, address, phone number, number of followers on Google+, image, author photo and much more. <br><br>  The plugin helps to create competent snippets, making them more attractive and clickable for the audience.  This will lead to an increase in traffic, and, possibly, positions in search engine output due to the strengthening of behavioral metrics. <br><br><h4>  Rich Reviews </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4b1/ae1/1b9/4b1ae11b9ede4e0e823fe870fb1e9529.png"><br><br>  <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/rich-reviews/">Rich Reviews</a> is a plugin that allows targeted posting of reviews on blog pages. <br><br>  <b>Plugin benefits</b> <br>  ‚Ä¢ 3 types of reviews: products (or pages), categories, site as a whole - allow to customize unique tasks. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Ability to choose exactly which reviews and where exactly to place on the site. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Simple design that allows you to easily integrate reviews with different page designs. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Shortcodes, allowing you to add reviews to any pages and specific places on them. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Display feedback in advanced snippets of Google search results. <br><br><h4>  Reduce Bounce Rate </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/77e/950/069/77e9500695d04d57b84f3514152abd06.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/643/ed7/dcb/643ed7dcba664b33ba3fce4c11b3bffd.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/53e/787/b2e/53e787b2eb554aa18901e295d7f0fb3c.png"><br><br>  <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/reduce-bounce-rate/">Reduce Bounce Rate</a> is a plugin that allows you to obtain more accurate data on the percentage of failures than in Google Analytic and other well-known analytical tools.  Example: one of the visitors spent 3 minutes on the site, reading the article, but without clicking links, without going to other sections of the menu, without putting likes.  The user just read the article, added it to the bookmarks and left the site.  For Google Analytics, such a scenario is likely to serve as an indicator of failure, and the time on the site will be fixed as 0. Reduce Bounce Rate helps to get rid of these errors.  The plugin every 10 seconds tells Google Analytics that the user is still on the site.  Thus, the percentage of failures in reports looks more plausible, which allows us to more objectively analyze the behavior of users on the site and find out which content works best.  So we will increase the usability of the resource and the overall satisfaction of visitors from viewing the site. <br><br>  <b>Plugin benefits</b> <br>  ‚Ä¢ Providing more objective statistics on the percentage of failures. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Set the time tracking of the presence and activity of the user on the site. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Support for both old and new Google Analytics code. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Ability to place code in both header and footer. <br><br>  <b>What useful SEO plugins do you use?</b>  <b>Share your experience.</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/234117/">https://habr.com/ru/post/234117/</a></p>
