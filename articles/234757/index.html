  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Gmini accessories reviewer - battery cases and mobile speaker</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> There is no sadder story in the world than the story of the eternal upgrade.  Recently, I talked about how I pumped the ‚Äúmemory‚Äù of my Samsung Galaxy S4 LTE phone before business trips.  It seems that everything has settled down, but now the vacation has come ... It took a reserve of autonomy and loudness.  With the help of simple manipulations in my hands were two cases with built-in batteries and a mobile speaker system.  Under the cut I'll tell you what's what, and how it all ended. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/abd/88e/f59/abd88ef5981f43eb9c2ba0b4c489f29e.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a80/07b/27e/a8007b27ebdc4c3d8e2a217af0065e82.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I'll start with the covers. <br><br>  <a href="http://gmini-acc.ru/products/102">Gmini MPCS45F White</a> and <a href="http://gmini-acc.ru/products/101">Gmini MPCS45 Black</a> - issue price on Yandex.Market - 1590 rubles <br><br>  Immediately about what catches your eye: yes, the covers are of different colors, yes, I have a dark phone, yes, a cover with a flip of white color.  It happened by chance =).

The standard Samsung Galaxy S4 LTE battery has a capacity of 2600 mAh, the total system capacity will be more than 7000 mAh.  In my normal mode, using one charge lasts for 12-13 hours, that is, with a case, the duration of the active life of the phone will be more than a day.  Charging will not be fast - the output current is 0.8A.  Actually in travel, especially associated with long trips to nature. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/284/c7f/874/284c7f8744d54488818ac6f4c9efed17.jpg"><br><br><br>  In order to put the case on the phone, you need to pull the upper part of the case, it is fixed on the case.  The phone is installed as a docking station, then snaps into place at the top of the case. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7f8/b47/0cd/7f8b470cd9c74782926f130ffa9505e7.jpg"><br><br>  The body is made of black plastic with soft-touch coating.  It is pleasant to hold the phone in hand, despite the significantly increased weight. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7e5/b2c/88a/7e5b2c88a24649e1b5802561a0929bad.jpg"><br><br>  The front panel has four blue LEDs, with which you can roughly estimate the level of remaining charge - it is easy to calculate that the price of one division is 25 percent. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/772/adb/4a9/772adb4a94374a9884ddb8e3c1425671.jpg"><br><br>  On the back of the case there is a small retractable leg for horizontal installation of the phone when watching movies or commercials.  Trifle, but pleasant, although personally I prefer to hold the phone in my hands. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/382/6ed/404/3826ed40475049e58cef95f1aad15bd4.jpg"><br><br>  The cutouts for the buttons are made neatly, the worn cover almost does not interfere with the management of the phone.  I will make only one remark - it seemed to me inconvenient how the headphones are stuck, but this is IMHO. <br><br>  Charging is connected from the bottom and, of course, has a microUSB connector for the convenience of the user.  I understand, we smell like captain Obvious, but recently a case with a built-in battery, which had a miniUSB, fell into my hands ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2ff/34f/660/2ff34f660a9348619052f054f49c3b64.jpg"><br><br>  The white case differs in many aspects of the exterior, but not in the filling. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/06d/532/174/06d5321740d54d80b4f7299304fc1f56.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4cb/0b3/370/4cb0b3370f2641488fa56748ee18bf0a.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/144/c1e/99c/144c1e99ccc7475b898828d05094b687.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/30d/4b1/c84/30d4b1c8421946c686b636d2158994f2.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4cb/0b3/370/4cb0b3370f2641488fa56748ee18bf0a.jpg"><br><br>  Plastic is used glossy, it is worth noting the fact that the cover does not fall very smoothly, apparently the phone is black and the cover is white) <br><br>  Otherwise, additional screen protection is very convenient, but when talking, I do not really like to keep the flip open. <br><br>  <b>Pro column.</b> <br><br>  <a href="http://www.gmini-acc.ru/products/115">Gmini mPlay Wide MP68B White</a> - issue price on Yandex.Market - 2009 rubles <br><br>  Small size and modest design suggests that there will be no miracles. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c43/bdd/c1b/c43bddc1ba5642f99c9cf6ccf43833be.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d06/e0a/e4d/d06e0ae4d878437fac9051057216de61.jpg"><br><br>  The device is turned on in a very original way: pressing the button on the upper edge leads to the automatic ejection of the ‚Äúears‚Äù on two sides.  Small speakers covered with a white grid.  On the right side there is a very bright blue LED that indicates readiness for pairing with a sound source. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fcd/e5c/40d/fcde5c40d12148a6b65d093bff21faf6.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/54d/9ba/6b7/54d9ba6b7d0f4bb9a57c5fa36da9481c.jpg"><br><br>  The delivery set: charging cable and audio cable - nothing superfluous, but everything you need.  The battery capacity is unknown, the duty cycle in my hands was 6 hours without connecting a power source - not the record result, but the device is quite small. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/17b/b10/d66/17bb10d6662c4db39da9f9dcf7e14d21.jpg"><br><br>  The reverse side of the moon contains an entire control panel (Play button, volume and track switching buttons) and power and line-in connectors. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/133/d0d/72c/133d0d72ccd04a10b0ca061659b14ef5.jpg"><br><br>  The column automatically starts searching for partners when it is turned on.  For owners of phones with an NFC sensor, life is a little simpler - attach the device to the label on the column and voila! <br><br>  The control panel works fine - iTunes switches songs, pauses.  I did not immediately understand why the buttons on the column, then, however, the thought crept in that the sound source was charging, and you could steer the music directly ‚Äúin the garden in the garden‚Äù. <br><br>  The power of the column is declared as 2 to 2.7 W - a total of 5.4 watts.  Reproducible frequencies from 100 Hz to 20 kHz.  When listening, I didn‚Äôt find fault very much, but still - AC / DC sounds very flat, ‚ÄúRussian rock‚Äù goes with a bang, but KEKS FM seems to have ordered a column for myself) Actually, if you consider that according to Yandex.Market, column costs about 1,500 rubles - no need to be naughty) <br><br>  It also turned out to be very convenient to use the column when playing different instruments in the Garage Band on the iPad - right away it became more pleasant to listen to your own tune-playing. <br><br>  The undemanding audience in the face of my children appreciated the opportunity to watch cartoons with high-quality voice acting.  And if to consider that the minicomputer with a built-in projector was used for viewing (there are plans to tell about it to habrausers), it turned out to be quite a mobile home theater. <br><br>  What is the result?  I am pleased with the Gmini lotions that helped me spend the holidays without any problems and with some amenities.  Ironically, almost immediately after the holidays, I once again bought an iPhone, and now I‚Äôm in for a new fight for covers and other accessories =) <br><br>  Shl.  And the speaker was registered in the nursery and now sings songs from Smeshariki almost around the clock. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/234757/">https://habr.com/ru/post/234757/</a></p>
