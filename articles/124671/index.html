  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Anonymity on the web: is there, will there be. Is it necessary?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The reason for writing this note (or, if you will, the article) was <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/startup/123204/">an article</a> about the anonymous service FireTalks, which does not require any authorization and, it seems like (I do not doubt it, but leave the possibility of any), does not keep the correspondence.  My opinion is quite different from the author of the service and the article, so I decided to raise this topic again. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  At once I will say that everything written below has no professional basis under it.  I have been engaged in amateur analytics of Internet trends for a relatively long time.  In the process of thinking about many issues surfaced and the topic of anonymity on the Internet.  Thinking about it (and discussing with other people), I came to the conclusion that it was the opposite of my original opinion.  However, let me set out the whole chain of reasoning from the very beginning. <br><br>  And for starters, we note the fact that the question ‚Äúwill the Internet be anonymous‚Äù is not worth it: it will not be so, at least in its bulk.  Because the trend of personalization of projects and services is contrary to this, and this trend is on the face: remember that relatively recently, you had to log in, basically, only when checking email, and now there are almost no new projects working without the need to provide a login and password. <br><br>  However, really, it is the dominance of services and sites that annoy you so much about you.  More often than not, they are not shy about ‚Äúasking‚Äù what they are interested in, but sometimes we also use Facebook's native authorization, after which, for example, the site allows us to look for presentations, knows where I studied, where I work, how much I have friends and a lot of other information ... And indeed, it seems as if you are not just being watched, and you are on the stage, sorry, what did the mother give birth to in front of a huge audience !!!

      In addition, many are interested in the issue of providing personal information to special services.  Many are afraid that it is provided.  Do not hesitate - provide on request!  And sometimes they bring it themselves!  And there is no difference Russian is a service, American or some other.  In the USA, everything is generally simpler than in the Russian Federation: there is a special law (if my memory serves me, passed after the tragedy of September 11) called the Patriot Act - it says in black and white that ‚Äúyour secret‚Äù can become ‚Äúobvious‚Äù . <br><br>  But is it bad? <br><br>  Campaigns use your personal information either to provide you with the most suitable offer or to collect statistics, which can also be sold to someone.  This statistics, I am sure, is mostly impersonal, since you specifically (If you are not Justin Bieber, Steve Jobs or someone else there), you are not interested in anyone except the traffickers (sorry, but this is true, but family and friends do not count) who want you to "push" something.  But analyzing this information is clearly not the traders, but the service itself, so it does not make sense to distribute it.  Moreover, the leakage of information about the dissemination of personal data has an extremely bad effect on the ratings of services ‚Äî this is not profitable for them. <br><br>  As for the special services, "they", of course, are watching as they can ....  And for the correspondence, and for talking and for the social.  networks in principle.  Everyone is following: the FSB, the FBI, and even, probably, Masad, together with the Belarusian KGB.  I'm serious.  Only here is the fact that this is not total surveillance: Soviet intelligence services were considered very effective, but at the same time, an average of seven people worked on one person (as I recall; unfortunately, I don‚Äôt remember the source).  Even if we imagine that surveillance is on the network, the matter is much simpler, how many people do you need to keep track of at least 20 million users in Russia ?! <br><br>  Automated snooping, you say.  Of course, not otherwise.  But what do I care what a software robot is reading and listening to me?  They are surely tuned in such a way that they choose for reading a person only letters connected either with terrorism or with a threat to the authorities ... And they are unlikely to be interested in anything else.  I am sure that if I tweet an ‚Äúintimate‚Äù conversation with my girlfriend, this will not particularly interest anyone, everyone is full of it, although it would seem, read it. <br><br>  If your letter was selected by the appropriate filter (or whatever it is), or you have a friend in the social.  Doku Umarov or Boris Nemtsov found a network (or another opposition politician, don‚Äôt think about being on a par with terrorists), then you, of course, were taken under the pencil. <br><br>  If someone is associated with terrorism, then I (like 99.99%) of the rest of the citizens are just glad that they found it.  And if someone is a threat to the current government, then it‚Äôs very likely that it‚Äôs a public figure, which almost completely excludes anonymity ... In other cases, you are probably not particularly interested in the special services, even if you swear obscenely to the President somewhere or anyone else ... <br><br>  Of course, my analysis will seem incomplete to many, but I am sure that, in general, the situation can be described as such.  So if you are an ordinary citizen, sleep well, without closing the page in Odnoklassniki. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/124671/">https://habr.com/ru/post/124671/</a></p>
