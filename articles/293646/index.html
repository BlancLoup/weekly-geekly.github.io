But this is how the first impression about you is formed.  And you need to be able to produce it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4d5/455/c38/4d5455c38a9442719603422e73c7ab14.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>"Tell me about yourself, Innokenty".</b> <br><h6>  Frightened, he clings to a corner and doesn‚Äôt know what to say specifically: that he likes to embroider a cross and make cheesecakes, or maybe it‚Äôs worth mentioning how your position sounds?  Innocent is difficult, and so are we.  What to do? </h6><br><br><h4>  <font color="#e41825">Tip # 1: Information as a contribution</font> <br></h4><h6>  So, let's compare: <br>  <i>‚ÄúHi, my name is Innokentiy Vorchunov and I‚Äôm a manager at McDonald‚Äôs.‚Äù</i> </h6><br><h6>  This is very good, of course, but even Innocent has a business card or it is fashionable to say a business card, where the same is written.  After such a presentation, you will not have any impression about the person, there will be a feeling that he has not revealed to you.  This is the same as writing dry letters and always reminding of respect (dear, for my part it would be disrespectful, with respect and so on). 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      Much better will sound the following: </h6><br><h6>  <i>‚ÄúHi, I'm Innocent.</i>  <i>I have been representing McDonalds for 15 years already, I have quite a lot of experience working with a variety of clients, I grow with our company and I know everything about the service and a little more.</i>  <i>Probably".</i>  // You can add that you are happy to meet you or are now ready to begin your report / story and so on. <br><br>  The joke will be very useful, as well as a few words about something else like your emotions, for example. <br></h6><br><br><h4>  <font color="#e41825">Tip # 2: Try to be remembered</font> <br></h4><h6>  Most often, after the presentation, a person forgets your name in 10 seconds. Can you imagine what will happen with the description of your work?  That is why you need to make in the story details and emotions.  And even better (and more effective) will immediately draw the attention of the audience to the fact that you can really be useful. <br><br>  For example, I would mention Innocent that he is ready to answer any questions that are related to working in the restaurant business, perhaps things would have gone better. <br><br>  You have to give something to remember you.  Let it be something simple, unobtrusive. <br><br>  <b>//</b> If it‚Äôs very difficult to remember and you have to make a presentation, then why not offer everyone a bar of chocolate or give out an apple (improvise).  But this is only when you know that you have to introduce yourself and speak in public. </h6><br><br><h4>  <font color="#e41825">Tip # 3: The Cultural Aspect</font> <br></h4><h6>  Here again, just remember about humor.  When people are sitting with serious faces during a presentation or just at an event, but they think that they need to buy sausage for the evening, this is ... a failure. <br><br>  In our country, of course, not everyone will be happy about the new joke.  Do not overdo it with political aspects (please man with a joke about sanctions only if he does not work in state structures). <br><br>  If you are talking to a foreigner, then try to draw any cultural parallels, discuss with him aspects that relate to life in another state.  Show interest.  If you joke about Silvio Berlusconi with an Italian, he will most likely appreciate it. <br><br>  And in general, if you often have to meet with foreigners, then try to explore the traditions of holding business events.  Just not to be trapped. </h6><br><h6>  <i>"Good day!</i>  <i>My name is Innocent.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>And my parents, of course, dreamed that I would become an actor (for Russia).</i>  <i>But my last name has nothing in common with Smoktunovsky, like my artistic abilities.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>I have been working at McDonald‚Äôs as an administrator for 15 years, during which time I learned a lot about the service and aspects of running a restaurant business in Russia.</i>  <i>The fast food network in our country was developing quite differently and I was able to lend a hand to this.</i>  <i>If you're interested, I can tell you later.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>// Very glad to see you at this event // Pleased to meet you.</i> </h6>  ... <br><br><h6>  PS Innocent is a fictional character (all coincidences are random).  We just wanted to give you an example of quite a visual one. </h6></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/293646/">https://habr.com/ru/post/293646/</a></p>
