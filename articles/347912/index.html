How to implement</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Often they ask the question - what is the platform "Single Frontal System" (EFS) and how it can be felt. <br><br>  The EFS platform is a unified basis that allows you to build omnichannel processes by combining multiple user services into a unified and understandable scenario for both the employee and the client. <br><br>  The solution architecture allows you to replace existing services, which are often not synchronized: it is planned to replace several dozen outdated front-end systems.  Last year we completed the active stage of coding - the future stream is aimed at introducing new products in all branches of banking.

      The process of implementing and replacing one system with another for customers should go unnoticed.  Provide stability allows the approach of testing and testing.  In previous articles, we talked about <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/efs/blog/341608/">DevOps changes</a> in the ESF, on <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/efs/blog/338164/">auto-</a> <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/efs/blog/341608/">testing</a> <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/efs/blog/338164/">techniques</a> , a new publication devoted to the qualitative aspects of this complex implementation process. <br><br>  Read under the cut with humor and irony harmful advice to the owners of the product and all those involved in the introduction of new services. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/dp/1m/dc/dp1mdczbbprss1jeuumkrwq13su.png"><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Frequent practice when at the stage of successful completion of acceptance tests the team‚Äôs enthusiasm ends.  Distribution delivered, KPI done?  So that's it, and what's next for him, who will use it and how, will not be so important anymore.  After all, there are new plans ahead for the development of new products, which means that there is no need to be distracted by minor tasks. <br><br>  Prioritization is our everything! <br><br>  Ignore all messages, calls and meeting invitations, conf calls and video meetings where the word implantation is mentioned.  The less you know the better you sleep.  And if you can not avoid it - delegate.  It is better to choose a young specialist who just came to the company - as they say, with new forces in battle! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/as/ai/om/asaiomjwbusmuwcbii9cmuhbhai.png"><br><br>  In the case when new functionality is introduced for the work of employees in the bank branch, consider that the road has now been ordered to you. <br><br>  Do not fall for tricks and any tricks, do not let yourself be lured to the bank branch, where you can meet the user of your product.  You will not see anything new there, and if you see it, do not change it.  Embed it as it is, endure - love. <br><br>  But if you nevertheless managed to cross the threshold - hide, show all your talents of disguise, to avoid meeting eye to eye with those who are destined to know all the joys of your imagination and wonders of the new product.  Pretend that you have nothing to do with the new system, closing your eyes and ears, and sneak into the leader‚Äôs office with a fast trot.  Empty-handed, as they say, do not come to visit, and sit out better with food.  Stock up! <br><br>  Separate advice for those who heroically overcame all the planning of a visit to the department and decided to meet with users - choose an office closer to home.  It makes no difference that, apart from this office, there are more than 10,000 branches in all regions of an immense country, because everything is the same everywhere, so why make additional efforts to travel outside the region? <br><br><h2>  Revizorro </h2><br>  And also the auditor and controller - do not forget to loudly and clearly define your task, your presentation should catch up with horror and trembling in the knees of all those with whom you decide to talk about the topic of the product being introduced. <br><br>  When communicating, frown, make your face as terrible as possible - more arrogance in your eyes, ask questions firmly.  Do not forget, as a mantra, to repeat the words "depremirovanie" and "punishment."  Your users love it! <br><br>  Repeat everything exactly, and you can become the epicenter of extreme excitement and attention.  And having become famous, do not miss the opportunity to extend this feeling and stretch the dialogue with your involuntary interlocutors for as long as possible: after all, they don‚Äôt have a more important thing than communicating with you, do they? <br><br>  There are no time limits for someone who wants to achieve his goal!  If the task fails to be solved for an hour or more - this should only encourage you, do not look for other ways, squeeze and wait.  Something in the end will definitely work! <br><br>  An ideal item for your observation of the user experience with the system is at the back.  Breathe him in the back, not forgetting to comment on his actions with meaningful shakings and emotional scowls. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ae/i2/jo/aei2jotyoatcq1uzl6754xw7ob4.png"><br><br>  Scroll below, we will share some more harmful tips on building communication with employees. <br><br><h2>  "I asked ash.." </h2><br>  Always remember that you and only you are an expert and know better how the system should work.  No doubt you have created the perfect product.  Therefore, stifle any desire to show empathy in yourself - the user will not tell you anything new. <br><br>  If suddenly your user is very talkative and shows a burning desire to share feedback on working with the new system, even if no one asks about it, listen, but do not write.  Suddenly you have to change something and redo it?  You should remember only your positive thoughts and laudatory odes.  You deserve it! <br><br>  Messages about bugs and flaws - this is for weak character.  This hardcore user will break through all the technical jungle and interface rebuses.  Remember - there are no witnesses, no problems, so keep quiet about the problems, allocate them completely to yourself.  Your team is your family, who honors and respects the creator of the perfect product.  Do not disappoint colleagues with the user's misunderstandings. <br><br>  Another impartial witness is numbers.  Therefore, any analytics or statistics will be an endless cause for concern.  To evaluate the effectiveness of the system, such a professional as you can by sight - quickly and easily! <br><br>  If suddenly something doesn‚Äôt work for you, don‚Äôt waste time analyzing root causes, the main task is to find and punish the culprit.  Do not spare the time and effort. <br><br><h2>  Successful implementation! </h2><br><br>  By following these harmful tips, anyone can ‚Äúfail‚Äù the implementation, even with the perfect product.  We will not discuss tips - the conclusions are obvious, we note the main thing that should guide the work with the product: the principle of "cost-income". <br><br>  The result is an embedded product and a happy user; it is a successful tool that allows a business to achieve goals.  To create such a product, it is important to remember that the customer is your user.  The auditor who will drive on the product and errors - your user.  To create a successful product, you must be obsessed with your product. <br>  This principle was followed by Steve Jobs, which helped him to create a qualitatively new product that became a symbol of the era. <br><br>  As a goodbye to colleagues who are engaged in product development, some tips: <br><br>  - at the initial stage, thoroughly study all the integration and interaction with adjacent systems; <br>  - do not forget about user feedback; <br>  - conduct ceremonies: retro, planning, demo - it works; <br>  - take care of the integrity of the team and the accumulated expertise; <br>  - maintain respectful attitude towards each other and under any circumstances remain a client-oriented person. <br><br>  What would you advise for the successful implementation of a new product? <br><br>  Share your opinion and cases, we will be happy to answer your questions in the comments. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/347912/">https://habr.com/ru/post/347912/</a></p>
