At the heart of the concept lay religious themes with a picture in the style of minimalism.  If I adopted a simple, easy-going style that will be relevant even after 2 years immediately, then the theme of religion, to say the least, has strained me. <br><br>  I am an agnostic myself, but I respect the opinions of believers.  Release, albeit not very hard, but a provocative video with a religious theme might not be the best solution.  Since the meetings in the Trailers Studio are prohibited (more on this below), the decision on this issue fell on my fragile shoulders. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  As is usually the case, I decided the case.  I got to the All-Night service in the local church (which is a separate story), but it should be noted that I had never been to church before.  What I saw made an unpleasant impression on me.  Priests with fat ryakham, talking about money, a shop inside the church with a very, very strange content, the whole process of the night itself is more like a cult.  I also had a short conversation with the priest who ended up visiting the store, where he asked me to give me a couple of prayers and some other small things, although the conversation was completely different. <br><br>  On the one hand, I knew that the situation in the ROC was something like this, but it‚Äôs quite another thing to see it with my own eyes.  It is clear that after this incident, I gave the nod to the movie in its original form.  Since we use our roller for faith more than any similar church church. <br><br>  A true believer, a bright, intelligent person, will laugh at the roller, will take it well.  And on the contrary, I will be very happy that this video will save us from working with conservative people without a sense of humor, who are the adherents of the Russian Orthodox Church (over which we easily humor), and not faith as such. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/045/2af/42a/0452af42ae7c37267a6859410805b0df.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Now about the meeting.  In early 2012, with my general's will, I banned the meeting in the studio.  In addition to meetings, all corporate values ‚Äã‚Äãand all corporate culture fell under the anathema.  Instead, we spend money and efforts on the most comfortable conditions of the work itself. <br><br>  If we express ourselves with examples, then gifts to others, corporate parties on NG, T-shirts of the same color, and chants in the morning are not.  A cozy office, professional equipment, free seminars for an employee, a correct team, drivers who will bring and take people away from work (in the future :) - yes. <br><br>  If we deduce from this rule, it will be something like this.  The company / office should not be a place of entertainment, recreation, non-work relationships.  All this should be replaced with elements that promote the development of the company and the professional growth of employees. <br><br>  I believe that soon all the tinsel in the form of corporate culture will collapse.  T-shirts of the same color will replace more complex matters.  Such as decency, mutual respect, respect for his and others work.  Companies will start spending money not on annual renewal of corporate colors in the entire office, not on a fake show-off before investors, but on updating monitors, on trainings, on training, on improving real performance, on improving the working environment. <br><br>  And the disgusting drunks, aimed at allegedly rallying the team, where working ties are torn instead and replaced with primitive types of ‚Äúwho drank with whom‚Äù will become a thing of the past. <br><br>  <b>But back to our <s>sheep</s> meetings.</b>  The following are the basic reasons why meetings at Trailer Studio were also banned: <br><br><ol><li>  Meetings remove the responsibility for the decision.  It seems that some decision has been made, and who is responsible is not clear.  Collective mind.  Even if you assign a responsible person, a whipping boy will appear, but there will be not much benefit from it.  As everyone knows, the decision is a collective one. <br><br></li><li>  Meetings reduce the level of advance preparation before a decision.  So you went to the polls and voted for the president.  Did you think a lot before voting?  Have many analysts read it?  Did you read anything other than the standard set of popular bloggers?  You personally may have read, and 99% of the country's population does not.  Because the degree of responsibility of each person is miserable: "Why should I understand the topic, anyway, my vote does not solve anything." <br><br>  Therefore, we now have such a president.  But imagine the situation when they say to you: ‚ÄúThere you are, get out of the crowd, as you decide, we will have such a president!‚Äù.  In this case, even the most narrow-minded person will spend much more effort on collecting information.  This does not mean that the result will necessarily be positive, but preliminary preparation is very important.  Meetings condone her neglect. <br><br></li><li>  Meetings eat unrealistic amount of time.  Why no one has yet derived the rule ‚Äúdeliberated = not working‚Äù.  Did not fulfill their main job duties.  I can not remember in the labor code such a position as a "counselor".  According to my personal feelings, they begin to deliberate every time when it is not clear what to do, and if it is not clear, then it is necessary to do the simplest thing - to confer.  It's like a pianist who, during a fire, starts playing the piano. <br><br></li><li>  Meetings hinder the growth of decision-making skills among employees.  To learn how to make the right decisions you just need to start taking them, even if they are erroneous at first, but this is just a matter of experience.  And the experience can not appear until all decisions will fall off on the collective mind.  Each in his place should be responsible for decisions in his field of work, and not delegate them to the team. <br><br></li><li>  Meeting as a drug, the more of them, the more you want.  So there are weekly large meetings and small daily.  Large-scale monthly meetings, with the participation of all levels of management, and small parties in the smoking room, where, as it seems, all important issues are resolved.  Therefore, once you have entered a deliberative way, be prepared that it will take up more and more of your WORKING time. <br><br></li></ol><br>  I'm not even talking about the fact that in half of the meetings, the meetings simply do not end with any result.  And it seems to me that each of you can add a few more items to this list. <br><br>  Instead of meetings, we have the following: <br><br><ul><li>  Unified project management system, where all discussions are conducted.  Where everyone can speak on any issue or project.  If you want to do this, if you have something to say. <br><br></li><li> Work counseling.  Differ from meetings in the number of people.  2 maximum 3 people gather and solve some one specific, currently relevant issue.  It is more likely not to solve any problems or issues, but to synchronize actions and vision.  For example, between the artist and the video designer. </li></ul><br><br>  It is clear that the topic is controversial, it is clear that there are many effective companies, where the opposite is true.  But in the Trailers Studio and in another company where I take an active part, the ban on meetings, for the time being, shows only positive results. <br><br>  Write in the comments wondering whether you will read similar posts.  Maybe return the format where I publish only the video and a short comment on it? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/145244/">https://habr.com/ru/post/145244/</a></p>
