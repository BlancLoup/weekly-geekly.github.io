  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Does Russia need aircraft carriers? - 3. "Homeless" ships</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <u>The carrier must have a berth</u> .  Standing at the pier, he gets water, electricity, steam from the shore.  Saving so  your lifespan. <br>  What am I talking about?  <b>A ship without a pier, it's like a man without an apartment!</b> <br>  Our aircraft carriers had no moorings and always stood in the middle of the bay on a barrel.  Boilers (parasil installation), diesel engines were constantly working.  Constantly darted transport for the delivery of water, food, fuel, etc. <br>  <b>Imagine how much water you need to wash thousands of people!</b>  <b>And how much food!</b>  <b>And fuel!</b> <br>  Constantly go boats and barges.  People carry.  From the shore to the ship and back. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <i>They waited once for a boat and a sailor-hook on the nose of the boat slipped into the water.</i>  <i>Missed the back hook and down.</i>  <i>Got between the pier and the launch.</i>  <i>Barkas hit a hook.</i>  <i>The officers look at the maid.</i>  <i>Usually the decision is made by the eldest.</i>  <i>The <b>senior officer</b> responded quickly: ‚Äú <b>Reverse to the longboat. Doctor! To the sailor</b> ‚Äù and sent someone for an ambulance.</i>  <i>The officers began to pull the man out of the water.</i>  <i>A few minutes later (!!!) the ambulance approached.</i>  <i>Taken away.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>In resuscitation, the guy died.</i>  <i>Solovyov was his last name.</i> <br><br>  The aircraft carrier has a large sail area and can easily rip it off the barrel. <br>  When the wind was not big, powerful ocean tugboats came up and held the ship. <br>  If the wind was expected to increase, the ship was removed from the barrel and went to the Barents Sea.  And walked there in circles until the wind subsides. <br>  The wind blows constantly from the beginning of October to the end of May.

      Slightly what - the city policemen ran to call the officers on the ship. <br><br>  We arrive at the pier, sit in the boat, on the ship - at sea. <br>  ========================================== <br>  Once came the cruiser from the dock.  Empty out.  Without ammunition, without food.  Fuel is not fully downloaded. <br>  "Kiev" flat-bottomed. <br>  Announced a storming.  We took off from the barrel.  Out in the sea. <br><br>  Evening.  21.00  The crew drinks evening tea in canteens, mess-rooms (officers, midshipmen). <br>  Suddenly the lights go out.  <b>Fully and throughout the cruiser.</b> <br>  Imagine? <br>  <b>There is no electricity on a warship!</b> <br>  Ship nearby o.Kildin (island at the exit of the Kola Bay). <br><br>  Usually, emergency lighting is turned on automatically.  It is parallel to the main lighting, each lamp has a battery.  The main lighting is cut down, immediately switching.  In order for this process to take place, at a minimum, there should be a battery in each lamp.  And, of course, it must be charged. <br>  The emergency was not lit.  Almost never lit. <br>  The officer always has two things with him: a flashlight (a dynamo with a pen so as not to depend on the battery) and a notebook.  Nobody requires a flashlight (but everyone wears it), but a notebook ...!  Without a notebook, an officer is not an officer. <br><br>  <u>Wheelhouse</u>  <u>Commander.</u>  <u>Captain 2 rank Melah.</u> <br>  " <b>CU chassis</b> " - cap asks.  It is good that at least the connection worked. <br>  " <b>There is a PEZ. Commander of the division of vitality of cap.3 rank Chervony</b> " (the name is not changed). <br>  " <b>Report the situation</b> " - cap. <br>  "I <b>report! The situation is full of gut!</b> " - Chervony responds. <br>  " <b>I do not understand. Red report as it should be</b> " - Cap. <br>  " <b>Comrade commander! Reporting! The situation is full of gut!</b> " - Commander divisionist responsible. <br>  And here comes to the commander of the cruiser .... <br>  " <b>Boys! Sailors! Save your commander! Do something! I‚Äôm s-a-s-s-a-s-d'l-y-y-t!</b> " The cruiser commander began to whine. <br>  " <b>So that you are dead, the dog is angry</b> " - came from the dark corner of the post of energy and vitality.  Someone from the sailors blurted out. <br>  The commander of the brigade of anti-submarine ships Cap.1 rank Yasnitsky appears in the wheelhouse. <br>  The ship carries on the rocks. <br>  Seeing the commander‚Äôs hysterics, the brigade commander commanded: ‚Äú <b>Kohl! Take the foreman and run to the NSHO to throw the anchor</b> .‚Äù <br>  (NSHO - bow mooring compartment). <br>  " <b>And how to throw it, if there is no electricity?</b> " - Says the commander. <br>  ‚Äú <b>I don‚Äôt know how. There should be a backup option. Botsmanov to the same place in the NSHO,</b> ‚Äù the brigade commander continues. <br><br>  <u>PEZH</u> <br>  Chervony turns after the conversation with the undercarriage to the sailors: " <b>Let's go all up the ass! I ran into the car. If they ask where, then answer it in the car</b> ." <br>  Chervony rushed into the car. <br><br>  <u>BIC (combat information center)</u> <br>  " <b>Guys,</b> " the officer of the SIC watch calls to the sailors: " <b>Now I will leave for 3 minutes in the cabin and go up</b> ." <br>  The watch officer rushed to get a party ticket from the cabin safe. <br>  Everyone can forgive, but the party membership card will never forgive. <br><br>  <u>Coastal posts NiS (surveillance and communications)</u> <br>  Darkness.  Works radar.  On the ship does not burn any running fire.  The cruiser does not contact.  Does not respond to requests.  Rushing towards the shore. <br>  Report to the operational fleet. <br>  Operational goes to the operational squadron: " <b>Where are you" Kiev</b> "?" <br>  ‚Äú <b>Floating. On storming in the Barents Sea</b> ‚Äù was the answer. <br>  The operational fleet orders the tugboats to proceed to the exit from the Kola Bay.  The nearest tug is in Murmansk.  It is up to Severomorsk to cut him 25 km, and across the bay from Severmomorsk.  More than 25 km. <br><br>  <u>NShO</u> <br>  Commander, first mate, boatswain. <br>  The chiefs are straining their boatswain: " <b>Son! Come on! Work!</b> " <br>  Boatsmanak took a sledgehammer, took aim somewhere, vlupil.  Anchor does not move. <br>  Botsmanenko still walked around.  Somewhere else took aim.  Vlupil. <br>  Anchor went down. <br>  U-fffff !!!  Thank God!!! <br>  Hooked on the underwater communication cable. <br><br>  To be continued‚Ä¶ </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/42238/">https://habr.com/ru/post/42238/</a></p>
