  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Customer review for Twitter for Android!</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Good afternoon, Habrovchane.  I decided at my leisure to deal with clients for Twitter on Android, the benefit is there to choose from, the Market is still teeming with them.  There are both excellent, worthwhile things, and applications are not very good, apparently the policy of moderating Market, or rather, its almost complete absence, affects. <br><br>  In this article I will consider: <b>Seesmic, Twidroid, Swift, Twicca</b> . <br><br>  First, I will describe their interface with screenshots, then at the end I will give a comparative table, which will indicate the capabilities of each application. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"

      <br>
      ATTENTION!  VERY MANY PICTURES !!! <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Seesmic </h4><br>  The client is wonderful, it was not for nothing that I returned to him twice, and now I continue to use it.  Recently, we launched support for several accounts and the ability to remember the position of the last read tweet after downloading a new content. <br><br><img src="http://img16.imageshack.us/img16/7025/logindl.png"><br>  <b>Login screen.</b>  Here you can select a default account. <br><br><br><br><img src="http://img222.imageshack.us/img222/9206/multiacc.png" alt="image"><img src="http://img214.imageshack.us/img214/1070/multiaccpushed.png" alt="image"><img src="http://img246.imageshack.us/img246/3680/multiaccmenu.png" alt="image"><br>  <b>Accounts</b>  Clicking on the account will open his timeline.  A long press on the account will open a menu where you can delete the account, go to the timeline, see the profile or write a tweet (compose).  By clicking on the Menu button you can add an account or go to settings. <br><br><br><br><img src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/8522/timelinec.png" alt="image"><img src="http://img251.imageshack.us/img251/9775/repa.png" alt="image"><br>  <b>Timeline.</b>  Clicking on any post will open it in full screen, which will include, except for the tweet itself, the full name of the follower, the date of sending the record and the client from which the sending was made. <br>  As you can see, users, hashtags and links are highlighted.  Links open, hashtags and users - read.  You can go to the sender's profile by clicking on it.  Also there are buttons for the answer to the record, retweet, direct messages, add to favorites. <br><img src="http://img11.imageshack.us/img11/9712/timelinepushed.png" alt="image"><img src="http://img63.imageshack.us/img63/87/sharev.png" alt="image"><br>  A long press on a tweet in the timeline will open a menu where everything is possible, as with the usual click + the ability to share this tweet (you can send it by e-mail, mms, to other Twitter clients or to Facebook). <br><br><br><br><img src="http://img214.imageshack.us/img214/5317/replies.png" alt="image"><br>  <b>Replais</b> .  Here you can see all the posts in which you were mentioned.  The remaining functions are identical with the timeline. <br><br><br><br><img src="http://img714.imageshack.us/img714/4428/99281733.png" alt="image"><img src="http://img13.imageshack.us/img13/6998/dm2j.png" alt="image"><br>  <b>Direct messages.</b>  Clicking on a tweet opens the conversation history with the follower. A long press opens a menu where you can delete the correspondence. <br><br><br><br><img src="http://img186.imageshack.us/img186/8392/profile1.png" alt="image"><br>  <b>Profile.</b>  Here you can see all the information about a person, the number of tweets and followers written, the presence of selected messages.  You can also fold or block a person, as well as see his location on the map (if he indicated the coordinates in the profile). <br><br><br><br><img src="http://img130.imageshack.us/img130/8796/lists.png" alt="image"><br>  <b>Lists</b> . In order to view your lists for reading, you can use your profile or simply press the Menu button and select Lists, and lists of other people look through their profile. <br><br><br><br><img src="http://nixan.org/android/twitter_clients/Seesmic/device2.png" alt="image"><img src="http://img203.imageshack.us/img203/7418/sendj.png" alt="image"><br>  <b>Send me a tweet</b> .  At the bottom of the button: the first one adds a photo or video, by the way, you can also shoot directly from the program, the second one - a location, or an address, or a link to maps, the third one - shortens links.  The application works fine with the clipboard.  If you have several accounts, you can select from which / which ones to write by clicking on @% username% at the top of the screen. <br><br><br><br><img src="http://img156.imageshack.us/img156/7164/poisk2.png" alt="image"><img src="http://img716.imageshack.us/img716/299/poisk1.png" alt="image"><br>  <b>Search.</b>  Here you can search for everything, users or view trends.  There is also a function to save the search or delete it, and the ability to load the saved searches from the site Twitter. <br><br><br><br><img src="http://img59.imageshack.us/img59/8562/set1.png" alt="image"><br>  <b>Settings.</b> <br><ul><li> <u>Default Account</u> - here is the choice of the primary account. </li><li>  <u>Number of Tweets</u> - the number of displayed tweets in the timeline (from 20 to 150). </li><li>  <u>Display full name</u> - display the full name, not the username. </li><li>  <u>Remember Position</u> - the ability to remember the position of the last read tweet, after downloading a new content. </li><li>  <u>Text size</u> - sets the text size from small to VERY large. </li><li>  <u>Notification</u> - notification settings (vibro, ringtone, flashing green light), update interval and what to update. </li><li>  <u>Photo service</u> - photo resolution service.  yFrog, Twitpic or MobyPicture. </li><li>  <u>Video service</u> - the same for video only.  yFrog, Twitvid, YouTube.  If you have a YouTube account, you can specify it in the settings. </li><li>  <u>URL Shortening</u> - link compression.  J.mp, Tinyurl or Bit.ly (if you specify the API or Bit.ly username in the following menus, you can see the statistics on your links on their website) </li></ul><br><br><h4>  Twidroid </h4><br><br>  Probably everyone who has a phone on Android and Twitter used it at least once, at least in many firmware from <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.org/">forum.xda-developers.org</a> this application is present. <br><br><img src="http://img682.imageshack.us/img682/1732/loginmw.png" alt="image"><br>  <b>Login screen.</b>  The application is localized. It is worth noting that the software holds SSL, as well as works with other services, namely identi.ca and wozai, it is also possible to manually enter the link to the server API, that is, I think, almost any Twitter-like service .  Yes, he also holds several accounts. <br><br><br><br><img src="http://img171.imageshack.us/img171/3051/timeline.png" alt="image"><img src="http://img695.imageshack.us/img695/2158/longpress.png" alt="image"><br>  <b>Timeline.</b>  Clicking on a tweet in the timeline will lead to the appearance of such a menu, where all possible actions will be listed: reply, retweet, erase, if this is your tweet, copy and look at the follower profile. <br><br><br><br><img src="http://img208.imageshack.us/img208/8193/mention.png" alt="image"><br>  <b>Mention.</b> <br><br><br><br><img src="http://img695.imageshack.us/img695/2079/96504961.png" alt="image"><br>  <b>Private messages.</b>  The implementation is similar to Seesmic. <br><br><br><br><img src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/7074/profile2j.png" alt="image"><img src="http://img19.imageshack.us/img19/8581/profilehk.png" alt="image"><br>  <b>Profile You</b> can edit your profile and enable location auto-update. <br><br><br><br><img src="http://img685.imageshack.us/img685/575/compose.png" alt="image"><br>  <b>New tweet window.</b>  Standard feature set. <br><br><br><br>  <b><a href="">img525.imageshack.us/img525/5283/poisk.png</a></b> <br>  <b>Search.</b>  Twitter sphere is the most popular links on twitter. <br><br><br><br>  <b>Settings.</b>  Here you can do without words. <br><img src="http://img94.imageshack.us/img94/6291/77835346.png" alt="image"><img src="http://img13.imageshack.us/img13/9936/79765432.png" alt="image"><img src="http://img442.imageshack.us/img442/3299/21137728.png" alt="image"><img src="http://img709.imageshack.us/img709/1433/25528702.png" alt="image"><img src="http://img197.imageshack.us/img197/7015/96447890.png" alt="image"><img src="http://img42.imageshack.us/img42/8563/55288043.png" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Swift </h4><br><br>  Prilozhenitsa stood on my phone for a long time, and something was somehow wrong.  Although many, I know, enjoy. <br><br><img src="http://img651.imageshack.us/img651/3726/loginn.png" alt="image"><br>  <b>Login screen.</b>  As you can see here there is a search on Twitter, and a list of trends. <br><br><br><br><img src="http://img696.imageshack.us/img696/8099/timelinei.png" alt="image"><img src="http://img713.imageshack.us/img713/3384/menuqzn.png" alt="image"><br>  <b>Timeline.</b>  In order to magically appear the menu of bookmarks, you must press the Menu button, then Change View or touch the top part of the application interface.  Jump to now - update tweets in the feed. <br><img src="http://img521.imageshack.us/img521/1730/repl.png" alt="image"><img src="http://img202.imageshack.us/img202/4121/convers.png" alt="image"><br>  Then everything is almost like Seesmic - if you click on a tweet, it will open in full screen.  Long pressing the interface does not understand.  I really liked the Show Conversatoin function - it shows the connection between the answers.  Links open in the built-in browser.  If you poke into the avatar or the name of the user, then his profile will open. <br><img src="http://img62.imageshack.us/img62/2302/123dgo.png" alt="image"><img src="http://img685.imageshack.us/img685/3415/sendsave.png" alt="image"><br>  If you click on the triangle in the circle, then a menu opens in which you can save the tweet (then you can send it by mail), copy its text or a link to it. <br><br><br><br><img src="http://img710.imageshack.us/img710/8193/mention.png" alt="image"><br>  <b>Menshon</b> .  Tweets with your name. <br><br><br><br><img src="http://img186.imageshack.us/img186/8564/98498012.png" alt="image"><br>  <b>Messadzhis.</b> Only replies to your direct messages in the form of a timeline, which is very upsetting. <br><br><br><br><img src="http://img39.imageshack.us/img39/7417/profileser.png" alt="image"><img src="http://img706.imageshack.us/img706/5024/profilei.png" alt="image"><br>  <b>Profile</b> .Here there is a search by user and you can see your profile.  Null under the photo - this is the lack of a site. You can send yourself a message or answer yourself, but catching yourself will not work.  You can also view your page on twitter.com <br><br><br><br><img src="http://img683.imageshack.us/img683/813/composer.png" alt="image"><img src="http://img692.imageshack.us/img692/6061/attacki.png" alt="image"><br>  <b>New tweet window.</b>  You can open it by clicking on the rectangle, with an incomprehensible circle in the center, in the upper right corner, or through the menu.  As you can see it is very small, the triangle in the circle provides access to the ability to "paste" the photo / video.  Another photo can be photographed from the program itself. <br><br><br><br><img src="http://img704.imageshack.us/img704/4496/searchkp.png" alt="image"><img src="http://img196.imageshack.us/img196/4802/16402575.png" alt="image"><br>  <b>Search.</b>  You can search for hashtags and words, just save the search and search near your location. <br><br><br><br><img src="http://img684.imageshack.us/img684/3454/settingsc.png" alt="image"><br>  <b>Settings.</b> <br><ul><li>  <u>Account</u> - username or account. </li><li>  <u>Password</u> -: D </li><li>  <u>Secure all connectoins</u> - if you tick, then the FSB will not know your password. </li><li>  <u>Send Usage Data</u> - anonymously sends information about your manipulations with Swift. </li><li>  <u>Notification intarval</u> - the frequency of updates (from "never" to once in 6 hours). </li><li>  <u>Timeline, Metion, Messages notifucation</u> - notifications in the respective tabs. </li><li>  <u>Select Rington</u> - select ringtones. </li><li>  <u>Vibrate</u> - vibration. </li><li>  <u>Photo Upload</u> - where to upload photos (yFrog, Twitpic, TwitGoo or Img.Ly). </li><li>  <u>Video Upload</u> - where to go video (Twitvid or yFrog) </li><li>  <u>Open links inside Swift</u> - allows you to open links in the program. </li><li>  <u>Advanced settings</u> - here you can configure another API. </li></ul><br><h4>  Twicca </h4><br><br>  In my opinion, the thing is very successful, it is a pity that so far only beta.  At least, I think something worthwhile will come of it.  It is worth noting that Twicca is available only under Android OS 1.6+. <br><br><img src="http://img522.imageshack.us/img522/4424/loginhn.png" alt="image"><br>  <b>Login screen.</b>  Well what can I say?  Minimalism. <br><br><br><br><img src="http://nixan.org/android/twitter_clients/Twicca/device.png" alt="image"><img src="http://img148.imageshack.us/img148/2158/longpress.png" alt="image"><br>  <b>Timeline</b> .  If you have a lot of followers, I think this program will be useful to you.  Perhaps the screenshot is clear, it can display in the timeline the posts of the people you marked in any color.  With a long press, you can select individual tweets, and then answer all at once, add to favorites and highlight them in the ribbon. <br><img src="http://nixan.org/android/twitter_clients/Twicca/device1.png" alt="image"><img src="http://img98.imageshack.us/img98/6918/share.png" alt="image"><br>  When you click on the tweet, a large menu appears.  Here you can do everything: answer, retweet, quote, write a direct message, see the chat history (similar to Show conversetion in Swift), see the user profile, follow the links, add to favorites, send reading lists, set the display color of the user or share a tweet functions, you can assign a default action). The mechanism for handling links, hashtags and usernames is the same as in Twidroid. <br><br><br><br><img src="http://img12.imageshack.us/img12/8193/mention.png" alt="image"><br>  <b>Manshons.</b>  It's all like everyone else. <br><br><br><br><img src="http://img651.imageshack.us/img651/8281/messageinbox.png" alt="image"><br>  <b>Direct Messagis.</b>  Only 2 buttons: go to outgoing and update. <br><br><br><br><img src="http://img27.imageshack.us/img27/7427/profileby.png" alt="image"><br>  <b>Profile.</b> There are all standard features available, you can read tweets, and add a person to the lists. <br><br><br><br><img src="http://img63.imageshack.us/img63/813/composer.png" alt="image"><br>  <b>New tweet window.</b>  # - hashtags, then compressing links, then inserting photos / videos and determining the location by GPS only. <br><br><br><br><img src="http://img194.imageshack.us/img194/2547/searc.png" alt="image"><br>  <b>Search</b>  There is an opportunity to save searches, and trends are interestingly implemented.  You can see trends popular now, today and this week.  But people do not know how to search. <br><br><br><br><img src="http://img46.imageshack.us/img46/4185/listscreat.png" alt="image"><br>  <b>Lists.</b>  You can create lists for reading, write a description and assign privacy. <br><br><br><br><img src="http://img199.imageshack.us/img199/9721/settingsqq.png" alt="image"><br>  <b>Settings.</b> <br><ul><li>  Account settings - login and password </li><li>  Timeline settings - setting the maximum number of downloaded tweets, go to the very top when new tweets are loaded, font size, show retweets, display the full user name, etc. </li><li>  Status update settings - setting the appearance of the retweet and many more settings. </li><li>  Search settings - search settings related to your location. </li><li>  Noticication settings - standard notification settings. </li><li>  Color label settings - here you can rename the selection colors of the followers. </li><li>  Front settings - setting fonts </li><li>  Profile settings - profile editor: biography, full name, home page address, location. </li><li>  Plug-in setting - setting plugins </li></ul><br><br><h4>  Summary table </h4><br><br><table><tbody><tr><td>  Customer </td><td>  Registration </td><td>  Images </td><td>  Video </td><td>  Links </td><td>  Services <br>  <sup>except twitter</sup> </td><td>  Total </td></tr><tr><td>  <a href="http://seesmic.com/">Seesmic</a> </td><td>  The icon is made on Android 1.6 guidelines, which is very, very wonderful, but in general the guys would be a good artist in the team. </td><td>  yFrog, Twitpic and MobyPicture </td><td>  yFrog, Twitvid and YouTube </td><td>  Bit.ly and J.mp </td><td>  - </td><td>  At the moment - my choice. </td></tr><tr><td>  <a href="http://twidroid.com/">Twidroid</a> </td><td>  Blue notifications in NotificationBar are smearing the eyes, and on the whole it's somehow gloomy. </td><td>  Phodroid, Twitpic, Twitgo and yFrog. </td><td>  only in paid version </td><td>  Short.to, TinyURL and is.gd <br>  Bit.ly can do the same, but in the paid version. </td><td>  Identi.ca, Wozai or a link to the API. </td><td>  Quality application.
