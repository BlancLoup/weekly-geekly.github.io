Also pleased with the opportunity to talk with experts. <br>  As the main hall I chose hall B "IT Pro", dedicated to the latest Microsoft technologies.  In my opinion, in this room was the widest range of reports. <br>  Also there are halls A for ‚ÄúDevelopers‚Äù, devoted mainly to .NET technologies and hall C ‚ÄúALM and newest technologies‚Äù, which mostly talked about Azure (first day) and Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 (second day). <br>  Video reports and presentations will be posted on the website <a href="http://techdays.in.ua/">techdays.in.ua</a> <br>  The schedule of the conference can be found here: <a href="http://www.msswit.in.ua/Schedule.aspx">www.msswit.in.ua/Schedule.aspx</a> <br>  Inside: a lot of letters, impressions, a summary of the presentations of the hall On the first day of the conference (December 2), the red cat, as well as scandals, intrigues, investigations and black magic from Microsoft. <a name="habracut"></a>

    <h4>  Day I. Introduction </h4><br>  Kiev met us with frost.  In some places even snow lay.  The buses that carried the conference participants from the metro to KyivExpoPlaza for free pleased us.  The conference is held in the spacious third pavilion.  Part of the pavilion is fenced off.  It is difficult to determine the size by eye, but it seems that all three rooms and a hall with tables for a coffee break, an expert area and a demonstration area with an Xbox and Kinect occupy almost a third of the pavilion. <br>  There was a slight hitch with registration: registration was divided into several parts alphabetically, and because of this there was a slight confusion: some of the documents were in the letter ‚ÄúX‚Äù and some in ‚ÄúK‚Äù, since my last name is in Russian and in English is spelled differently.  Anyway.  I hope this will be the biggest nuisance at this conference. <br>  Separately, I was pleased with the freebie: a raincoat with the conference logo, a notebook with a pen, and various printed materials of an advertising and educational nature. <br>  The platform with three kinects at first was occupied only by reception girls, but by lunchtime, there was nowhere for the apple among those who wanted to test the kinect.  While it wasn't too crowded, we tried Kinect Adventures with a friend and beat each other in boxing.  The games themselves do not represent anything supernatural, however, the concept of ‚Äúcontroller without controller‚Äù is unusual.  Personally, I was happy as a child.  Although after an intensified PR, Kinect does not expect a delay of about 0.3 seconds, which at first is confusing. <br>  But registration is coming to an end, and we are all called to <br><br><h4>  Key report of the first day </h4><br>  After a short introduction, where participants are told about the order of the conference, and where the halls and key objects such as the Kinect toilet and coffee breaks are located, Dmitry Shimkiv, general manager of Microsoft Ukraine, takes the stage.  Arguments about the future begin, historical background on the development of cloud computing and cloud experience. <br>  In particular, Dimtriy began with a story about a car project into which systems are integrated that allow you to control the systems of the car itself through ... a mobile phone, including  the possibility of authorization through the phone.  These phones, united in one network, can interact with each other, warn about traffic jams and so on.  Twitter began to seethe. <br>  In the end, we come to level 5 of building data centers.  In particular, the Microsoft data center in Chicago is shown.  Servers are located in large containers, similar to those transported by vans.  All communications, power and cooling are carried out to the containers, standing in even rows.  What was especially unusual: some of the servers are in the open air and use natural resources for cooling and obtaining ‚Äúgreen‚Äù energy, which makes it possible to save a lot on server maintenance - up to 70% (although it was not entirely clear from the context, costs are reduced by ‚Äú or ‚Äúup to 70%? In any case, the numbers are impressive). <br>  After general words about the interaction of devices and applications in terms of cloud development, the most important part of the presentation begins: Microsoft Azure is a new platform for creating and managing distributed cloud systems and web applications.  Several examples were cited, among them: a certain French company engaged in market analysis and forecasting, all of which is calculated in the cloud running Azure.  Azure also participated in the rendering of Avatar and the new Toy Story.  There were also examples when it is much more profitable to rent a cloud instead of building your own data center: a pizza ordering service over the Internet, renting a cloud running Azure per day in the US super bowl;  Football Broadcasting in Spain: The Cloud and Silverlight Client. <br>  The development of clouds occurs in two directions: for mere mortals (for example, Xbox LIVE) and for business. <br>  After all, a video about the future in the vision of Microsoft was shown: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/kdhllEGwAZ4%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhgz031TavFgmx8GBrbgr20uPWSVvg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  After that, Dmitry Shimkiv invited everyone to participate in the competition of projects on Windows Azure. <br>  After the coffee break, everyone went into the appropriate rooms. <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/Wi1FpNBkAd8%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhjI3BRs6NwpRV3tvir13UDuodXvBA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  All reports in one post did not fit therefore here are links to articles: <br><ol><li>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/microsoft/109311/">Microsot SWIT (Day I, Reports 1) ‚ÄúUnlimited computing capabilities for your organization - from HPC Server to Azure‚Äù, Oleg Kryuchkov, ‚ÄúPersonal Clouds: Desktop as a Service‚Äù, Igor Shastitko</a> </li></ol></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/109303/">https://habr.com/ru/post/109303/</a></p>
