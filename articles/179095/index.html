  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Terms, jargon, and definitions of Android</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/01b/fd0/b7d/01bfd0b7dcb2a294521e9077528c98b2.png"><br>  Very often, dealing with an unfamiliar software product or operating system, we feel difficulties in understanding the meanings of terms.  Sometimes we meet them for the first time and this forces us to search the Internet for descriptions and articles.  It is worse if the spelling of the term coincides with what we knew before, and the meaning is different.  This is especially aggravated when reading articles in a foreign language.  Therefore, I present to your attention the translation of terms taken from the <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php%3Ft%3D1466228">Android Terms, Slang, Definitions &amp; Guides</a> . <br>  The original text consists of seven parts, which in addition to terms includes descriptions and instructions on how to perform some common actions with a smartphone.  This is the first part where the most common terms are collected.  This set of terms is very convenient to use before the first programming lesson on Android, as a handout, so that students, after reading, can understand what they are talking about if they suddenly slip through the slang word in the question or answer.  Basically, terms are intended for beginners and are related to customizing the operating system.  Both the definitions themselves and the translation do not claim exceptional uniqueness, correctness, accuracy and rigor.  Any suggestions and corrections are accepted with joy and gratitude. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  Author's note </h5><br>  <i>I assume that the creation of this branch will help both beginners and experienced forum users in understanding the Android jargon, besides there are several terms, the meanings of which I do not know when creating this post.</i>  <i>I collected most of the terms, definitions, and slang words I was able to dig up.</i>  <i>If I missed something, let me know and add them to the branch or change them according to how new terms, definitions and slang words will be introduced.</i> <br><h5>  Android terms, jargon and definitions </h5><br>  <b>Apps2SD</b> : The method of saving applications and cache data on the device‚Äôs microSD card. <br><br>  <b>ADB</b> : Android debugging interface (literally: Android debugging bridge) is a multifunctional command line utility that allows you to communicate with an emulator instance or a connected device with Android OS.  This is a client-server utility that includes three components: <br><ol><li>  A client that is running on a developer‚Äôs computer.  You can start the client from the console using the adb command.  Other Android utilities, such as the ADT plugin, and DDMS also create adb clients </li><li>  A server that is running as a background execution process on a development computer.  The server serves communication between the client and the adb daemon running on the emulator or device. </li><li>  A daemon that runs as a background execution process on each instance of the emulator or device. </li></ol><br>  <b>Android</b> : A Linux-based operating system for mobile devices such as the HTC EVO.  Alphabetical (English) versions are coded by confectionery names: Donut, Eclair, Froyo, Gingerbread, Honeycomb, Ice Cream Sandwich, Jelly Bean. <br><br>  <b>AMOLED</b> : Active Matrix on Organic LEDs.  This is usually a very bright display with good color reproduction, which some smartphones have.

      <b>APK</b> : Android application package file. Each Android application is compiled and packaged into a single file that includes all application bytecode (.dex files), resources, attachments, and a manifest file.  An application package can have any name but must use the .apk extension.  For example: myExampleAppname.apk.  For convenience, the application package file is often referred to as ".apk". <br><br>  <b>Alpha</b> : Alpha release life cycle stage is the first phase of the start of testing (alpha is the first letter of the Greek alphabet, used as number 1).  During this phase, developers typically test software using the White Box technique.  Additional confirmation is obtained later by other teams of testers using the ‚ÄúBlack Box‚Äù and ‚ÄúGray Box‚Äù techniques.  Moving to black-box testing within an organization is called alpha release. <br>  Alpha version p.  may be unstable and cause data failure or loss.  The exception is when alpha is publicly available (as a pre-order bonus), in which developers are normally brought to stability so that their testers can test quality.  External availability of alpha applications is not common in proprietary software.  However, p.  open source, in particular, often has publicly available alpha versions, often distributed as source code in p. <br>  The alpha phase usually ends with a ‚Äúfreeze‚Äù of functionality, which means that additional functions cannot be added.  In this case, they say that the application is functionally filled. <br><br>  <b>Boot Animation</b> : A term (boot animation), denoting a graphical representation of the operating system boot process.  Boot animation can be a simple visualization of running boot messages in the console, but it can also be a graphic or a combination of text and graphics.  Unlike the ‚Äúwelcome screen,‚Äù the boot screen or boot animation is not necessarily developed for marketing purposes, but it can enhance the user experience or provide the user with messages (with color coding added) to diagnose the system state. <br><br>  <b>Bootloader</b> : The purpose of this program is only to load other data or programs that will later be executed from RAM.  Often, multi-level loaders are used, during the execution of which several programs are launched one by one, increasing complexity. <br><br>  <b>Bootloop</b> : Describes the state when your system reboots time after time without logging into the main operating system. <br><br>  <b>Beta</b> : This is the development phase of p.  following alpha.  It usually begins when p.  functionally complete.  Usually p.  in the beta stage, there are many more errors than the completed bp, as well as it loses in speed / performance.  Beta testing focuses on reducing user interaction, which often includes usability testing. The beta delivery process to users is called a beta release, and this is usually the first time that p.  become available outside the organization that developed it.  Beta users are called beta testers.  They are usually customers or potential customers of the organization that developed the software that wanted to test the software.  for free, often receiving a complete version for free or at a reduced price.  Beta version p.  often useful for demonstration inside organizations and potential customers.  Some developers turn to previewing, prototyping, technical pre-ordering, or for early access at this stage.  Some p.  is constantly in beta stage - when new features are continuously added to the p.  without installing firm final release. <br><br>  <b>CPU</b> : It stands for (Central Processing Unit) and handles all the complex mathematical formulas needed for such everyday things as browsing the Internet. <br><br>  <b>Custom</b> : Independent developers who like to configure devices deeper than the standard settings, publish the fruits of their research to share with others in the form of custom ROMs. <br><br>  <b>Cache</b> : A component that transparently stores data in such a way that it is processed faster with future access.  The data stored in the cache must be values ‚Äã‚Äãthat were previously calculated or duplicate values ‚Äã‚Äãstored elsewhere.  If the required data is cached (hit the cache), this query can be served by simply reading the cache, which is relatively faster.  Otherwise (past the cache), the data needs to be calculated again or retrieved from the original source, which is relatively slower.  Therefore, the more requests will be processed from the cache, the faster the overall system performance will be. <br><br>  <b>CDMA</b> : A mobile communications standard called cdmaOne, CDMA2000 (3G evolving cdmaOne) and WCDMA (3G standard using GSM connectivity), which is often referred to as simply CDMA, and using CDMA as a downstream data access channel. <br><br>  <b>CIQ</b> : stands for Carrier IQ.  A piece of preinstalled software that runs with elevated rights in the background of the default portable device and recording everything.  Potentially can be used to steal information. <br><br>  <b>Dual Core</b> : A dual-core processor is a CPU that has two separate cores in one package and with its own cache.  These are practically two microprocessors in one.  This type of processor is widely distributed among many manufacturers.  Another type of many nuclear processors is also designed.  including quad-core, six-core, eight-core and multi-core processors with an even greater number of cores. <br><br>  <b>Dalvik</b> : The Android.Dalvik VM platform virtual machine is only an interpretive virtual machine that executes files of the Dalvik Executable format (.dex), a format optimized for efficient storage and distribution of memory. <br><br>  <b>Dalvik Cache</b> : A writeable cache that contains optimized bytecode for all apk files (applications) on your Android device.  Storing information in its own cache makes application loading faster and execution better. (Improves performance? - <i>translator's note</i> ) <br><br>  <b>EXT</b> : (Extended file system) The extended file system (Extended file system), or ext was implemented in 1992, as the first file system created specifically for the Linux kernel.  Its metadata structure was created by the R√©my Card, inspired by the traditional Unix File System.  It was the first implementation using a virtual file system and it could handle file systems up to 2 gigabytes in size.  Ext2, ext3 and ext4 file systems are derived from this.  Most of the discussions are concentrated around ext3 and ext4 in the Android world. <br><ul><li>  ext3 is a journaling file system commonly used by the Linux kernel.  Its main advantage over ext2 is journaling, which improves reliability and eliminates the need to check the file system after an "incorrect" shutdown.  Overall, ext3 is slower than ext4, JFS, ReiserFS and XFS, but it has a significant advantage that allows you to upgrade to ext2 without backing up and restoring data.  Measurements show that ext3 also uses less CPU resources than ReiserFS and XFS.  It is also significantly safer than other Linux file systems due to its relative simplicity and testing.  ext3 does not check sum when it writes to the log and if the hardware does delayed caching, you have the risk of getting some file system corruption causing the crash; </li><li>  ext4 was created as a series of backwards compatible ext3 extensions.  In January 2010, Google announced that its storage infrastructure would be upgraded from ext2 to ext4.  In December 2010, they also announced that they would use ext4 instead of YAFFS on Android.  The advantages of ext4 include support for large files, extents, current memory pre-allocations and logging checksums; </li></ul><br>  <b>FC / FC's</b> : Short for force close, meaning that the application failed. <br><br>  <b>Fastboot</b> : A diagnostic protocol used mainly to modify the flash-file system in Android smartphones from another computer via a USB connection.  This is part of the Android Debug Bridge library. <br>  Using the Fastboot protocol requires that the device be launched in such a boot loader mode or Second Program Loader mode, in which only the bulk of the hardware initialization will be performed.  After activating the protocol on the device, it will accept any command that came to it via USB from the console.  Some of the most used commands include: <br><ul><li>  <i>flash</i> - Overwrites a partition in flash memory in a binary way that resides on the host computer. </li><li>  <i>erase</i> - erases the partition in flash. </li><li>  <i>reboot</i> - Reboots the device into the main operating system or into the system recovery partition. </li><li>  <i>devices</i> - Displays a list of all devices (with serial number) attached to the computer. </li></ul><br>  <b>Flashing</b> : non-volatile memory used in smartphones, tablets, etc.  Often, the same as flash memory in SD and USB flash drives, just optimized for better speed and performance while the operating system is running. <br><br>  <b>Hotspot</b> : An access point that provides access to the Internet through a wireless network using a router of an Internet provider connected to the network.  Hotspot usually uses Wi-Fi technology.  You can connect wi-fi compatible devices. <br><br>  <b>HDMI</b> : This is a compact audio / video for transmitting encrypted uncompressed digital data.  This is a digital alternative to consumer analog standards, such as (RF) coaxial cable, video cable, S-Video, SCART, component video, D-Terminal, or VGA (also called D-sub or DE-15F).  HDMI connects digital audio / video sources (such as as net-top, DVD players, HD DVD players, Blu-ray Disc players, AVCHD encoders, PCs, game consoles (such as PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360), AV receivers, tablets and mobile phones) to compatible digital audio devices, monitors, projectors and digital TVs. <br><br>  <b>Hboot</b> : Mainly responsible for checking and initializing hardware and starting a phone call.  It can also be used to record official releases of bp, as well as some other things.  HBoot can be comparable to the BIOS in the computer. <br><br>  <b>HAVS</b> : a control system that dynamically adjusts voltage based on CPU usage.  This is proven to reduce battery consumption, but also has a reverse effect when several control systems interact (for example, setCPU). <br><br>  <b>JIT</b> : The Just-in-Time Compiler.  Appeared with the version of Android 2.2, it is a method of significant acceleration of Android applications on the software side. <br><br>  <b>Kang</b> : Some people write code, some modify the code to make their release, they consider it as kang release. <br><br>  <b>Kernel</b> : The kernel is a software layer that allows the operating system and applications to interact with the hardware of your phone.  The extent to which you can interact with the functionality of the hardware depends on the quality of the kernel code.  The HTC homebrew community (rutting) has made several improvements to the kernel code, which provide additional features compared to the stock kernel.  When you write an alternative firmware, you automatically get the kernel.  But you can also write a separate firmware for the kernel on top of the existing one, effectively rewriting it. Today, the difference in functionality between alternative cores is less pronounced, and more related to alternative settings.  As a rule, choose a kernel that works best with your firmware. <br><br>  <b>Launcher</b> : Summarizing, this is part of the Android user interface on the home screen that allows you to launch applications, make phone calls, etc.  It is built into Android, or can be obtained from the Android Market. <br><br>  <b>LCD Density</b> : Pixel Density (Resolution) is a measurement of screen resolution in different contexts, usually computer displays, scanners, digital cameras. <br>  First of all, you need to understand that the Android user interface uses something called ‚Äúpixel independent of the display‚Äù or ‚Äúdip‚Äù (yes, this name is confusing, because the density settings in ‚Äúdots per inch‚Äù or ‚Äú dpi ", which is considered the same as" ppi "or" pixels per inch "(pixels per inch)). <br>  Usually, the LCD Density settings on Android are 160 dpi.  Thus, the OS considers that 1 dip is equivalent to the size of one physical pixel at a resolution of 160 dpi (1 dip @ 160 dpi = 1 screen pixel), this is not necessarily the case, but you need to start with something.  In my opinion, it would be much better if they chose 100dpi, because it would be much easier with percentages, but they did not choose, because we puzzle with this formula.  (in fact, the formula for the size of one pixel is: px = dpi / 160, for example, for 240 dpi we get px = 1.5, that is, the size of one dip = 1.5 physical pixels - the <i>note of the translator</i> ) <br><br>  <b>Mod</b> : Modifying parts of hardware or software or something else in this sense to provide additional functions not planned by the developer. <br><br>  <b>NILFS</b> : (New Implementation of Log-structured File System - New implementation of log-structured file systems) is a log-structured file system for Linux.  It was developed by Nippon Telegraph and CyberSpace Laboratories Telephone Corporation (NTT).  It uses the copy-while-recording technique ‚Äúnothing in life is free‚Äù, NILFS records all data in a continuous, log-like format that is only added, never overwritten, such a device is intended to reduce the number of movements, and minimize these types of data loss, that occur after a normal file system crash.  For example, data loss on the ext3 file system when the system crashes on a write operation. When the system is restarted, the log records that the recording is not finished and any partially recorded data is lost.  NILFS also includes fast write and restore, minimal damage to file data and system integrity in case of hardware failure, 32-bit checksums, etc. <br>  Normally, Android kernels do not have NILFS support, but there are mods that make it available. <br><br>  <b>Nandroid</b> : Nandroid is used for backup and restore.  You can choose regular backup (phone only), or backup + sd-ext (phone + Apps2sd).  Both will make a backup of your system, the second option will also make a copy of your applications on the SD card. <br><br>  <b>Nightly</b> : Build at the end of each development day.  If you use a constantly-running server, it can be configured to collect code and run unit testing at each control point.  At the end of each day, you can run more intensive tests, regression tests, and integration tests, for example, that take too long to run at each control point and will run after the nightly build.  If you have a consistent development system, then nightly builds can also be used to pass code into testing for users. <br><br>  <b>OpenGL ES</b> : Android provides the OpenGL ES libraries that can be used for fast and complex 3D images.  They are harder to use than the Canvas object, but better for 3D objects.  The android.opengl and javax.microedition.khronos.opengles packages provide OpenGL ES functionality. <br><br>  <b>Open &amp; Closed Beta</b> : Developers release either open or closed beta;  closed beta versions are released to a select group of people for user testing by invitation only, while open beta is released available to the general public and to all interested.  Testers report any bugs they find, and sometimes offer additional features that they would like to see available in the final version. <br><br>  <b>Overclock</b> : Increase the speed of your CPU. <br><br>  <b>Partition</b> : The internal memory of the phone (not the SD card) is permanent (flash) memory, NAND.  It can be partitioned like a regular hard disk.  The bootloader is on its own partition, Recover separately, radio, system, cache, etc.  - all these sections. <br>  Standard sections on an Android phone: <br><ul><li>  / misc - I don't quite understand what it is for. </li><li>  / boot - bootloader, kernel </li><li>  / recovery - contains a recovery program (either clockworkmod or RA recovery for ruled Evo) </li><li>  / system - here is the operating system: Android, Sense, boot animation, Sprint crapware, busybox, etc. </li><li>  / cache - cached data for the operating system </li><li>  / data - user applications, data, settings, etc. </li></ul>  The sections described below are not specifically designed for Android.  They are associated with the hardware of the phone, the kernel must have a code to interact with the specified hardware. <br><ul><li>  / radio - radio firmware of the phone, controls mobile communication, GPS, data, bluetooth. </li><li>  / wimax - firmware for Sprint's flavor of 4G, WiMax. </li></ul><br><br>  <b>PRL</b> : Preferred Roaming List (Preferred Roaming List), usually a way to tell your phone which tower to connect to first. <br><br>  <b>RUU</b> : a complete package of <b>b</b> .  manufactured by HTC, it can hold a lot of things that they are trying to update. Radio, ROM, bootloader,  .‚Ä¶  ruu        ‚Äî      .    ,    . <br><br> <b>Recovery</b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">: The recovery partition is a boot mode for the phone that allows you to delete settings from the data partition on the phone (hard delete), or make an update using the update.zip file in the root of the microSD card. This is a common thing (also optional) to overwrite and patch a Recovery image, such as TWRP or ClockworkMod Recovery. This allows you to run Nandroid backup from the device, and modification of the flash, as well as files from the device, usually meaning the installation of software on the devices. The recovery mode is separated from the ‚Äúnormal‚Äù mode, and can be turned on by pressing the home switch including the phone. </font></font><br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Rom / Firmware</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">: Read-Only Memory and in the language of technology, it refers to the internal storage of the device, which is designed to store instructions of the operating system, which should not be modified during normal operation of the device. </font></font><br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Radios</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> : From the point of view of HTC, radios consists of:</font></font><br><ul><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> WiFi, which operates at 2.4-5ghz frequency, depending on the channel </font></font></li><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Cellular / 3G, which transmits voice and data </font></font></li><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 4G / WiMAX that transfers data only </font></font></li><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> GPS that only takes </font></font></li><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Bluetooth that communicates with WiiMotes and wireless headsets </font></font></li></ul><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Flashing a radio ( </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">just like that in the original</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> - translator's note) means changing the code that controls the way the phone receives and sends a signal. </font></font><br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Ram</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> : (Random Access Memory - random access memory, direct translation) A group of memory chips, usually of type dynamic RAM (DRAM), which function as the main working field of a computer. When the PC first entered the market in the second half of the 1970s, 64KB (64 kilobytes) of memory was the maximum threshold. Today, 64MB (64 megabytes) SDRAM is the entry level for a desktop computer, a thousand times more.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"Random" in RAM means that the contents of each byte in the repository can be directly obtained without reading the byte before or after it. This also applies to other types of memory including ROM and PROM. However, unlike ROM and PROM, RAM requires power to maintain its contents, which is why you should save data to disk before shutting down the computer. To study the RAM chips and how to upgrade your memory, look for the memory module. To study what memory is used for data processing, look for computer or memory. See also dynamic RAM and static RAM. </font></font><br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Root</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> : Root Directory (First Level Folder) </font></font><br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Rooting</font></font></b> :     , ,       Android   (  ¬´ ¬ª)   Android's.              ,        ,       ,   ,  -     Android.    jailbreaking      Apple iOS  Sony PlayStation 3.  Android,        . <br><br> <b>SBC</b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">: (the ability to use the battery over the usual safe limit). The concept is similar to CPU overclocking: you exceed the safe level for additional performance. The goal here is to get more from the battery for one charge. The downside is that you can damage the battery or significantly reduce its battery life. Some cores declare that they use safe techniques that prevent damage to the battery. Just keep in mind the potential risk. </font></font><br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Sideloading</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> : This means installing applications bypassing the official Android Market. </font></font><br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Splash screen</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">: Splash screen (welcome screen) is an image that appears while the android is loading. Splash screens covers the entire screen or just the rectangle in the center of the screen. Splash screen of the operating system and some applications that expect to run in full screen mode usually cover the entire screen. </font></font><br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Superuser / SU</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> : On many operating systems, the superuser is a special user account used by the system administrator. Depending on the operating system, the name of this account may be: root, administrator or supervisor.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Normal work on such an operating system is carried out using a normal user account, and therefore it does not have the ability to make changes applicable to the entire operating system, viruses or other malicious software. - or simple user errors - will not give the opportunity to transfer the effect to the entire system.
