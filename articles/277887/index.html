Many do not understand why they are needed, but each time for a new year, the <a href="http://nsk.zarplata.ru/articles/2343663/">topic rises in the news</a> and fierce battles flare up.  And we shot and did not regret!  Although it was very hard. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/434/91f/5bb/43491f5bb4624bd28e21d02302494818.jpg" alt="Calendar 2016"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  EastBanc Technologies has been producing corporate calendars since 2012.  We immediately abandoned the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãundressing female colleagues or hiring professional models and undressing them, and for the first couple of years we just drew funny characters.

In short, create a beautiful visual metaphor of EastBanc Technologies.  And in 2014, we came up with 13 plots, which were our heroes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/56f/3f1/6fc/56f3f16fc4a74312b39e9bd8f8ff7fc0.jpg" alt="Calendar 2015"><br>  <i>Here you can see the whole EastBanc.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/65e/72a/229/65e72a229d204bbf894e237a439ef84c.jpg" alt="Calendar 2015_September"><br><br>  <i>And this QA-engineer Lyuba plays the runaway bride</i> <br><br>  For filming, we managed to find a real Chevrolet Camaro, a rare ‚ÄúVictory‚Äù and a vintage wedding dress, sneak in on secret reptile to academic musicians and try out the DJI Phantom 2 quadcopter and GoPro Hero4 Black camera. <br><br>  We made this first game calendar for 2015 ourselves.  The main idea was to show how different we are - romantic, playful, funny guys.  For 2016, it was decided to change the idea - to focus on working on the product and our processes.  And for the implementation of hire a stylist and photographer from the side. <br><br>  They came up with the idea themselves: fantasy about the beginning of the twentieth century, Saint-Exupery is still a little boy, flying across the Atlantic ahead, a young aircraft designer wants to build a plane and open a new page in the history of aeronautics.  There were no tasks to strictly adhere to the historical realities, therefore no one bothered about anachronisms and inconsistencies - a fantasy, after all, not a documentary. <br><br>  So, our hero is an aircraft designer in search of funding for an ambitious project.  He wants to raise on the wing of a new model of the aircraft.  He has to deal with aviation moguls, investors, lose and win with the support of friends and his beloved. <br><br>  The main role is Taras, sales manager of EastBanc Technologies. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/072/e97/dda/072e97dda80440bbad313eb4c93d32cb.jpg" alt="Taras"><br><br>  We decided that such a story is a good allegory of work at EastBanc Technologies and got down to business. <br><br>  First of all, the stylist sent us a wonderful document with the poetic name of moodboard - in fact, a set of pictures that convey the mood, the atmosphere, the style in which the future calendar will be kept.  It looked like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b8c/ad7/857/b8cad7857ebf4360a41aaeeba7cb5a59.jpg" alt="moodboard calendar"><br><br>  Here were also the images of the characters, their postures, how the light should fall, who with what facial expression, what the location looks like, what accessories are put on, what is on the table - everything is fine. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fb4/2d4/f64/fb42d4f648bc439a93512e9148673fd2.png" alt="moodboard calendar 2"><br><br>  Since  the stylist traveled around Europe while thinking over the images, she went around the ruins and flea markets in European towns, buying everything suitable for shooting: canes, glasses, shoes, clothes, cigarette cases ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6c5/67d/206/6c567d206f61419da31c1bab4e65f754.png" alt="Accessories"><br><br>  The stylist and photographer collaborate with interior salons, know their assortment and think through what might come in handy: they found a library in one place, a designer‚Äôs office was removed in another, and a place was set up where the competitors of aviation moguls were impressively located. <br><br>  We ourselves agreed with the third location - a small airfield, after which a tight schedule of filming was made.  It was necessary to meet in 5 days. <br><br>  First we went to shoot scenes at the airport.  It was a terrible cold.  Our girls-designers, whose task was to determine the composition of the frame, put on all the possible jackets and jackets that were found in the machines.  But the guys courageously starred in some overalls, so that was believable. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/849/c42/b7d/849c42b7db974a2c9d4a262e6833aa14.jpg" alt="Designers at the airport"><br>  <i>Our girls-designers, the heroines of "September", inspect the props</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/362/acc/9a7/362acc9a796c4a2dafacba0477f636fc.jpg" alt="Dima"><br>  <i>The head of the infrastructure department Dima gets used to the image</i> <br><br>  These curiosities were to be retouched.  Yes, they are not very similar to the aircraft of the beginning of the last century, but do not forget, we have a fantasy on the subject, and not a re-enactment of the gatherings. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ac1/434/545/ac1434545e50414a9fbabe61fb598fe9.jpg" alt="Aircraft 1"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/32b/df6/bfe/32bdf6bfecff407eae52a0b0445e4d86.jpg" alt="Aircraft 2"><br><br>  The second day was filmed in truly royal interiors, a huge underground labyrinth in the center of Novosibirsk, stuffed with decorations for every taste. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/725/cc1/b70/725cc1b70b9b49848fc830e52a2c5120.jpg" alt="Interior Salon"><br><br>  An episode was shot here when a designer comes with drawings to the owners of aircraft factories.  They are happy with their business and therefore reject our hero.  The magnates were played by the project managers, their look was supposed to radiate success and complacency.  Yura and Zhora coped with the task for five. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/da5/43e/584/da543e5848b24ab8a9015ed618b3503e.jpg" alt="Jora"><br>  <i>Stylist conjures over the details, Zhora rehearses snobbery in his eyes</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4a4/2a7/0b9/4a42a70b9fc742e590dd4b4aa31989d1.png" alt="Yura"><br>  <i>Yura enters the image of a magnate</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0af/c44/c15/0afc44c1538b495aa1a7c66196f938ef.jpg" alt="Taras makeup"><br>  <i>Taras participated in all five shooting days.</i>  <i>At the end of the week, he was punished for his career as a great make-up artist and laughed a lot, imagining how he chooses a brush to apply blush with an experienced movement of his hand.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c58/62e/b76/c5862eb766c74510913805be66b04194.jpg" alt="Interior Salon"><br>  <i>The interiors are full of fragile, breakable items.</i>  <i>Dragging the props from place to place, we, of course, banged one - openwork porcelain chicken.</i>  <i>I had to buy.</i>  <i>Now the besklyuvaya chick lives in our sociable kitchen.</i> <br><br>  The work on the set struck everyone: the make-up, the selection of the details falling into the frame, the poses, the expression of the faces ‚Äî all this was scrupulously filmed, in the amount of several dozen frames.  Everyone was tracked right there on the computer screen and the model received another recommendation how to move a finger and what facial muscle to pull.  Our guys seem to understand what professional models get money for: hellish, hours-long, grueling and monotonous work.  But the result!  It became clear that the casting was carried out as it should: all the actors perfectly fit into the role.  The most difficult thing for the guys was to grope the necessary intonation for the perfect frame. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4ed/048/b57/4ed048b5753a47d096f5d034cd79c366.jpg" alt="inventor and magnates"><br>  <i>The end result after retouching.</i>  <i>The dog, by the way, belongs to our colleague.</i>  <i>She was the most charming and obedient actor on the set.</i> <br><br>  Next in the story, the designer goes to the investors, who were played by our directors and the main analyst.  This has already happened in a different interior cabin. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/837/945/cae/837945cae07a430bba3172b835712664.jpg" alt="Investors"><br>  <i>Putting light on investors</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/213/c06/d2f/213c06d2f7d249b48a5e4a4a2630629a.jpg" alt="investor image"><br><br>  <i>The image of investors assumed hair styled with briolin, clean shaved hair, and binding ties.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6b9/545/2ad/6b95452ad7d643e197d09c37fbe1919b.jpg" alt="Serious men"><br><br>  Shooting this story was the hardest thing: when so many serious men gather in one office, the air begins to pop from the electricity. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0a7/576/d5a/0a7576d5a1a34886857bf6da34421510.jpg" alt="Designer and Investors"><br>  <i>And the result!</i> <br><br>  The plot with the girls, of course, in this story is the most awaited :) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5e3/e32/5f4/5e3e325f4f874dc6af03bbaa9132d54e.jpg" alt="Tanya"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ad8/2d0/218/ad82d02184f14a1a92194ce002b81dd2.jpg" alt="Dina"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0f7/9fc/3ec/0f79fc3ecb704d468b223becb2fa4d3a.jpg" alt="Girls at work"><br><br>  And without a love story has not done.  The most difficult thing was to make two colleagues, happily married / married to other people, look like this in this story.  The guys were embarrassed, but the task was completed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bab/501/ad5/bab501ad5f734f2f876ecc4484a3d150.jpeg" alt="Inventor and muse"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6fc/f78/cdd/6fcf78cdd9a14ff685b74fd636814220.jpeg" alt="Ira"><br>  <i>How the image of the Muse of the hero was created: everything in the image is intended to confuse the viewer with respect to historical time - vintage clothing + tattoos</i> <br><br>  Experienced filmmakers say that it is very difficult to work with children, but if you find an approach to them, the tape will become a cash register.  So we experienced it for ourselves.  The young hero of the December list at first tried to smash the interior, but the huge fan for special effects fascinated the actor and the shots turned out to be the best in the entire photo shoot. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9cc/6f7/8aa/9cc6f78aa76748e3bdca53d6ea64968e.jpg" alt="Kid"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/745/b1b/4ab/745b1b4ab3694c95b5f24c7f02628b1a.jpg" alt="Frame with baby"><br><br>  Five days of filming were noisy and intense.  It must be admitted that for any of our colleagues this did not become entertainment, they had to work too much.  Nevertheless, everyone was very pleased to get such an experience - they were filming almost like a real movie! <br><br>  Then everything went a little more tragic: the first version of the retoucher was unanimously turned - there was too much surah and art in it was to our taste.  It seemed that the project failed, we would not have time to do anything ... As a result, we insisted on a more ‚Äúdocumentary‚Äù, realistic approach, and the result suited us.  It sounds like nothing terrible, but in fact kilometers of nerves were spent. <br><br>  The print run was printed exactly to send to friends and clients, everyone who is truly friendly with EastBanc Technologies, trusts our professionalism and appreciates our experience.  We tried to prevent the calendar from falling into the hands of random people.  So it is unlikely at least one went to gather dust in the far box. <br><br>  Will we again shoot such a complex subject calendar?  It is not excluded!  Repeat, of course, is not bad, there will be a new creative challenge.  The concept is already being written. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a1b/e21/fb3/a1be21fb3b724c74962a41084c7ead89.jpg" alt="brainstorming"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/727/6ce/589/7276ce58970a498aa1064b726f351057.png" alt="He flew!"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/277887/">https://habr.com/ru/post/277887/</a></p>
