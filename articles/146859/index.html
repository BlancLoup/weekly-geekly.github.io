This is an infrequent, responsible matter, and therefore requires at least determination from the person, and, at most, special intellectual efforts to weigh the pros and cons (if you do not plan to start looking for a new place right after the transition).  For 6 years of experience, I changed jobs only once and want to share those thoughts that I had during this transition. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Why should a person change jobs?  They pay more there (not everyone. <i>- Hereinafter, KO notes</i> ), there is no need to work on weekends (unless deadline, there are no critical bugs for users, etc., etc.), the boss is kind and understanding (on Sundays), it is easy to reach a manager there (five other new employees also said that).  Continue? <br><br>  I do not want to exaggerate, but it seems to me that the work is often changed to a new one, not because I like the new one so much (do not even think about it at the interview!), But because the negative towards the old gradually accumulates.  The new work is quite difficult to assess, until you work there.  But the sensations from the old place - more than enough.  So how do you make a final decision?  If there was an opportunity to work a month at a new job and if you don‚Äôt like it - quickly slip away on the old one - that would probably be the ideal option.  Some do just that, settling for vacations at the main job informally to a new place.  However, such a trick with ears does not always go away and when choosing a new place of work, most employees feel they are sappers - if you make a mistake, write to them. <br><br>  The decision to change jobs I took a long time.  Probably half a year, and maybe even a whole year.  At first it was just some kind of sensation, which gradually became more and more formed and took on the appearance of a specific goal.  Naturally, I had several long conversations with my direct manager, a little less with a higher manager and literally a couple with a gene.  director.  I tried to convey to all these people what exactly does not suit me at the current moment and what ways I see as a way out of this situation.  I was pleased that I was heard and (it seems) even understood.  In response to my suggestions, alternatives were presented to me.  After analyzing the current situation, I still decided to move to a new place.  One of the key factors was that this was my first job and I just really needed to compare it with another, and not only compare it from the outside, but from the inside, after working there and there.  This would allow me to be convinced of the correctness of my ‚Äúexternal‚Äù assessments of the new place, developed at the stage of making the decision on the transition.

      To compare, you need to have some indicators that can somehow be assessed.  Through long reflections, for myself, I derived four factors that weakly depend on each other, which, in my opinion, make it possible to most characterize a particular place of work. <br><br><h4>  Criteria POGD </h4><br>  So, the criteria POGD.  The abbreviation appeared even before I came up with her mnemonic rule.  POGD is easy to remember, because both externally and in meaning is similar to the word POGOD.  So, what is the job at the new place of work? <br><br>  <b>P - Perspectives</b> <b><br></b>  <b>O - Attitude</b> <b><br></b>  <b>G - Hemorrhagic</b> <b><br></b>  <b>D - Money</b> <br><br><h5>  Perspectives </h5><br>  In this part of the evaluation criterion, you can put all your expectations about possible studies that are waiting for you in a new place.  The criterion is very broad.  It accommodates both short-term and long-term perspectives, and this concerns all areas related to work.  This is your professional growth, and career growth and the possibility of establishing new useful contacts, and the potential growth of your salary (not the amount itself, but the possibility of its gradual growth), and more and more interesting tasks, and more and more comfortable working conditions, growth of your credibility and many other improvements that are not expected immediately after the transition, but with time. <br><br><h5>  Attitude </h5><br>  We work as a team and therefore we have different relationships with many people.  These are your colleagues, direct manager and management of the whole company.  With all we can build different relationships that can be described as positive, neutral or negative.  Do you want your colleagues to respect you?  Or maybe you want them to be afraid of you?  Try to decide for yourself which relationships are acceptable to you, which would be preferable, and which would be unacceptable.  Things like complimentary coffee with buns, pool passes, social programs and flexible working hours are also relevant.  Attitude to you by the company.  Appreciate it. <br><br><h5>  Hemorrhagic </h5><br>  This is what you will do :).  More precisely not so.  This is just the part of your work that you don‚Äôt like.  Those.  this is the negative that you experience when performing your duties.  For someone, the negative may be too difficult work, work that requires constant attention, work that requires frequent contact with customers or something else.  Negative may be the lack of flexible schedule, frequent travel or the need to work on weekends.  Considering that you will still be engaged in your favorite work, hemorrhage is only that part of it that you don‚Äôt really want to do or want to, but not now. <br><br><h5>  Money </h5><br>  I specifically put in last place the fact that most people are the first and only reason for changing jobs.  After weighing the first three reasons, consider whether this delta of tugriks really is so important to you.  Is it worth it?  If there is even the slightest suspicion that the other factors outweigh, it is better not to change work.  Otherwise, you will have the feeling that you just bought cheap.  Are you ready to trade your time, your perspectives, your good relations at your old job for IT?  If you think about this issue well, you will understand that the blunt rule ‚Äúpay more here‚Äù does not always work.  On the other hand, the money factor echoes to some extent with the perspective factor.  As one very intelligent person said, money is an unrealized opportunity.  If you have money, you have the opportunity to DO SOMETHING.  For example, buy a car, a house or start a business.  If there is no money, then there is no possibility.  Accordingly, if the salary increase is just what you lack now for the realization of something more, the money factor turns out to be decisive. <br><br>  Since the above factors are difficult to estimate numerically, you can try to use a comparative scale like ‚Äújust‚Äù, ‚Äúslightly better‚Äù, ‚Äúmuch better‚Äù.  Using such estimates, it is possible to put at least a little in mind that mess that arises when you want to make a decision about changing jobs. <br><br>  Good luck to everyone at work!  (old or new - it doesn't matter if you like what you are doing) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/146859/">https://habr.com/ru/post/146859/</a></p>
