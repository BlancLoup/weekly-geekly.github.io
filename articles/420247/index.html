Since I have relevant experience, I will share with you experience in IT in the Far East. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/od/r5/m9/odr5m9wu4hp1wt41dvp9vilv28g.jpeg"><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h3>  What is the Far East </h3><br>  All IT life in this region takes place in two centers - Khabarovsk and Vladivostok.  The rest of the cities have only small glimpses of IT, where the main number of IT firms is 1C Franchisee. <br>  Taking into account the choice of Vladivostok, as the capital of the entire Far East (means the inflow of budget funds), as well as the uniqueness of the natural conditions - I will focus on it and its surroundings.

      I must say that Khabarovsk is a good city, but it is normal.  It can be compared, for example, with Nizhny Novgorod.  Those.  a resident of central Russia, there will not find anything new, and even far from the sea. <br><br><h3>  Climate and nature </h3><br>  Dreamed of living in the region, where by car you can get to the sea, mountains and lakes for a couple of hours - Vladivostok is your choice.  Great beaches with good water and a sandy beach.  Abundant number of mountain peaks of medium height (800-1400 meters), taiga and virgin nature. <br><br>  Of the minuses is the lack of infrastructure.  Those.  you can get there, and even you can find a decent catering, but that‚Äôs where all the comforts end.  The resort business is poorly developed, a tent on the beach or a wooden hut with outdoor facilities is still the pinnacle of what is.  Of course, there are a couple of good places, but the price tag is too high there.  The beach season is three months - July-September. <br><br>  As for climate, the situation is as follows. <br><br><ul><li>  Approximately 1 month of the year (from mid-July to mid-August) is hellish stuffiness and heat.  You go out into the street, and you get the feeling that you went into the bath.  The end of August is the rainy and typhoon season. </li><li>  April - November - very good, stable temperature, when you feel very good. </li><li>  December-March is such a light winter.  Sometimes a typhoon comes along and brings a lot of snow, but most often it keeps -10 / -12 outside without snow. </li></ul><br>  From what catches your eye - these are trees.  If in Moscow these are 10-15 meter tall trees, then right there everything is crooked 5 meter, but fluffy. <br><br>  There are tigers, but their habitat is a territory where, apart from small villages, there is nothing.  Therefore, if you do not get there yourself, then nothing will happen to you. <br><br>  Conclusion: The weather is not resort, but at times warmer than in Moscow.  Sun, sea, mountains, forests and taiga. <br><br><h3>  Food </h3><br>  On average, the price of food is 10-20% higher than in the European part of Russia - the choice is also smaller.  Its production is relatively small; it has become several times more expensive to deliver from Southeast Asia since 2014.  For example, to buy good apples, you need to buy New Zealand apples for 160 rubles per kg.  There are Chinese by 105-110, but their quality is significantly worse. <br><br>  As for fish and seafood, the situation is very sad.  For an adequate price (lower than in Moscow), you can buy ordinary fish - flounder, pollock, pink salmon.  Everything else has either a price, as in Moscow, or even higher.  The reason lies in the fact that after 2014 it has become very profitable for producers to export everything to Japan, Korea, China, and nothing remains on the local market. <br><br>  Of course, there is always the opportunity to buy seafood from poachers - the price there will be relatively adequate.  But, first, the quality of products is not always adequate - improper storage.  Secondly, I don‚Äôt really want to encourage such guys. <br>  On the positive side, this is a good Ussuri distillery.  Good settings on herbs, good rum - and all at the right price. <br><br>  Conclusion: the conclusion is that the price tag for products is higher than in Moscow, there is less choice, seafood is scarce and expensive. <br><br><h3>  The cost of housing in Vladivostok </h3><br>  On average, an adequate odnushka in Vladivostok, taking into account the communal, will cost you 25-30 thousand rubles.  If you take areas more distant from the center, or a suburb - then you can find it in 15-20.  You need to rely on panel five-story buildings and nines - 1981-1989.  Everything that is new is already a price tag, as for the ‚Äúbusiness class‚Äù. <br><br>  Most often, people work without contracts.  But, as a rule, the percentage of throwing at an average cost is extremely low.  If you want to find something cheap, then at your own risk. <br><br>  The cost of housing to buy is very similar to the price tag of St. Petersburg.  Those.  we take the panels of the Vyborg district, and we get the cost of Vladivostok.  This is one of the reasons why so many people from Vladivostok leave for St. Petersburg. <br><br>  Also, often people buy housing in the suburbs of Vladivostok, the price tag is lower there, but it takes longer to get to the city. <br><br><h3>  Work in IT </h3><br>  Salaries are much lower here than in Moscow and St. Petersburg.  Conditionally, you can give these gradations: <br><br><ul><li>  30-45 Junior </li><li>  45-60 Middle </li><li>  60-80 senior </li></ul><br>  From time to time they come across even higher, but this is very rare (most often I see for mobile developers). <br><br>  The number of vacancies, taking into account 1C-programmers, web designers, administrators, technical support, etc. - 264 today.  The main technology stack is PHP / 1C / JavaScript. <br><br>  Most of the work is wholesale companies that import and sell something (the largest employer is DNS).  There is an analog Avito - also a large company.  Everything else is already small things of all kinds. <br><br>  Very few companies that outsource China, Japan, USA, Australia.  With the first two - language and cultural barrier.  With two others - the low level of developers.  If the developer has his hands, then he is rather quickly handed to the state for a remote job, or he is offered a relocation.  I myself work for a remote, and get about 2 RFP levels of Vladivostok. <br><br>  Conclusion: there is work, but sn does not shine, and the level of tasks is quite typical.  If you take smaller cities in the region, for example, Ussuriysk - 200k people, then there are 5 vacancies for the whole city - fota the goods and upload them to the online store. <br><br><h4>  Perspectives </h4><br>  I would like to say at once that in the region it used to be felt that people have money.  Automobile business, Buy-Sell from Asian countries and fishing gave good money.  Now the first two moments were covered administratively, and people became poorer.  Many nightclubs and businesses have closed. <br><br><h3>  Infrastructure and logistics of the region </h3><br>  Recently, a lot of money has been invested in the region, so the quality of roads, utilities, and recreation areas are being kept in order.  However, this is all relatively true for 100km around Vladivostok.  We drive off a little further, and the ass begins. <br>  As for the availability of logistics, then everything is sad: <br><br><ul><li>  Ticket Vladivostok-Japan - 13 thousand rubles one way. </li><li>  Ticket Vladivostok-Moscow - 15 thousand rubles one way. </li><li>  Ticket Vladivostok-Seoul - 10 thousand rubles one way. </li><li>  Ticket Vladivostok-Pyongyang - are you really interested in this? </li></ul><br>  Of course, you can always take a bus tour to cross-border China, but there: <br><br><ul><li>  Nothing to do - just a big Chinese market </li><li>  It has become much more expensive after 2014. </li></ul><br>  Even go to Khabarovsk the day, since the distance is like Moscow-Peter, but there are no high-speed trains. <br><br>  In other words, there is a certain isolation, to go somewhere is expensive.  And if on the plane there are commuters from Sakhalin, then an amazing 8 hours of flight is waiting for you. <br><br>  One of the advantages is the syndrome ‚ÄúFar from Moscow‚Äù.  Everything that happens in the European part of Russia does not really bother you, so you can live in peace and not bathe. <br><br><h3>  Crime </h3><br>  With crime in the region has become adequate.  Those who could not reorganize to normal life have long been somewhere at the bottom of the sea, while the rest began to run a legitimate business.  Of course, there are customers who start: ‚ÄúYou work well - you live well, you work poorly - you live badly.  And with a bad life do not live long. "  But this is a great rarity. <br><br><h3>  Additional entertainment </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/mb/2s/b6/mb2sb6ggdz7majzvk9hywiz_vgu.jpeg"><br><br>  In the region is the largest casino in the Russian Federation.  If you have money, you can have a good time and play.  It was built taking into account the Asian players, so it was planned to open several buildings at once, an aquapark and so on.  But everything turned out to be not so rosy, so additional objects are introduced late. <br><br>  In the region there are many objects of the military infrastructure of the USSR.  It is possible to crawl well in the bases of submarines, nuclear weapons storages, take-off lanes and play stalker.  Also in the bay Fokino there are many military vessels on conservation, including the nuclear cruiser.  You can get to it. <br><br>  There is a track for drift.  True in the current position to buy a car in the European part of the Russian Federation is already cheaper than ours.  But you can take a hybrid and save on gasoline. <br><br><h3>  Nice bonus </h3><br>  For some strange reason, the region has very beautiful figure skaters.  Perhaps this is due to the fact that people were resettled here from the Kuban and Ukraine, and no one else influenced the gene pool, but fact is a fact. <br><br>  You arrive in Moscow a huge number of girls without priests, without breasts, of small stature, ala teenage girls.  In Vladivostok, however, most of the figured forms are pleasing to the face.  Well, the opportunity to smuggle Asian cosmetics, too, decides - rarely come across scruffy girls. <br><br><h3>  What can be said as a conclusion </h3><br>  The region has its pros and cons, as well as all the locations.  But something to decide and move here from the European part of Russia - why! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/420247/">https://habr.com/ru/post/420247/</a></p>
