  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The experience of creating a budget school information system</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  This article will not describe the most advanced technologies.  Here everything is much more modest.  I just want to share my experience in organizing a budget school information system. <br><br>  We have a regular school, for 1300 schoolchildren + about 100 employees (teaching staff and technical staff).  There are 118 computers, a couple of servers, 18 interactive whiteboards and a bunch of other computer peripherals from the computer equipment (and all this hardware is far from new).  In general, the school is not spoiled with financing on ICT (unlike the capital ones). <br><br>  And in 2011, the school receives a grant for development - as many as 400 thousand rubles.  The management decided to take a risk - and for a part of this money they decided to create a school information system.  The total budget of the system amounted to 140 thousand rubles, not at all thick, but what to do.  But the name of the system was given a proud - Interactive Information System (IIS).

The system includes: <br><ul><li>  two LCD TVs (55 "diagonal); </li><li>  one information terminal with a 19 "touch screen and with the strange name" Fugue "(produced by Soyuzpolitekh from Rostov-on-Don); </li><li>  One iRU nettop (one of the few at the time with SVGA and HDMI outputs); </li><li>  one access point LinkSys WRT54GL (legendary piece of iron !!!); </li><li>  Well, from expensive components - two HDMI cables with a length of 20 meters (I remind you that it was 2011 and there were no ‚Äúwhistles‚Äù like Chromecast in nature yet). </li></ul><br>  The functional diagram of the system is shown in the figure: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/011/dc5/7af/011dc57af221fffe52ef7319660be930.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  All this hardware was mounted in the school lobby: TVs are hung on brackets on the wall: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bd7/9d1/44d/bd79d144d5abf96d4f493967276ad42f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The information terminal was installed near the guard's desk (anchor bolts in the concrete floor, power cables and HDMI are connected in the floor wiring box). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/21d/db4/fe7/21ddb4fe769b4e741d8302d79062268e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Nettop and access point installed in the box guard (sorry for the mess in the connecting cables). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a0d/463/212/a0d4632124387d19aae84c5c39acfaf1.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Nettop via HDMI is connected to the right TV panel, works under Ubuntu. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3f2/5d9/a86/3f25d9a86cebc20d4e9f2a861394d94e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The panel through Google Chrome (in full screen mode on F11) displays the tape of the <a href="https://twitter.com/School21Kovrov">school‚Äôs official Twitter account</a> .  Showing responses in the tape is disabled, so tweets (or retweets) are posted to the tape, which are posted only by the school administration. <br>  By the way, there is exactly the same tape on the school website (you can look at <a href="http://edukovrov.ru/site/school21/portal/start">school21.edukovrov.ru</a> ).  A tweet appears on both the TV panel and the site at the same time for a maximum of 3 minutes without reloading the page.  Very comfortably. <br>  Even on the right television panel school hours are placed (with reference to the schedule).  The panel displays information about what lesson or change is now taking place, how much time has passed since the beginning of the change and how much time is left. <br>  On days of school-wide events, a poster is displayed in full-screen mode on the panel (well, like this).  If necessary, nettop is controlled over the network using UltraVNC, but this rarely happens. <br><br>  The left television panel is connected by a second monitor to the computer of the information terminal.  Initially, he also worked on Ubuntu, but due to problems with the touch panel drivers, Windows 7 had to go (this coincided with the school‚Äôs entry into the Microsoft K-12 program, and no additional software costs were required). <br>  Well, for the convenience of managing the content of the information terminal in 2013, the school acquired a license from SteKiosk (about 7 thousand rubles). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/339/8e6/8ea/3398e68eab79bc1ac87908b110e60454.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  SiteKiosk has increased the security of Internet surfing on the terminal (now access is available not only to the school site, but also to other resources). <br><br>  Posters are displayed on SiteKiosk on the left panel in the slide show mode (as a rule, these are infographics from the Ministry of Education and Science on the Unified State Examination, tips on safe use of the Internet from Google, fire safety posters from the Ministry of Emergency Situations, just static posters, etc.). <br><br>  In general, I tried to build a system in such a way that keeping information up to date does not take much time. <br><br>  It is organized as follows: for example, take a schedule. <br><br>  The school has a head teacher responsible for the schedule.  It is <s>impossible</s> to train and make her regularly update information about changes in the schedule through the Drupal admin panel. <br><br>  To simplify this task, Google Drive has documents (presentations), in which the head teacher and makes adjustments.  These documents are built into the necessary Drupal pages, and already it is available on the information terminal.  As a result, the head teacher works in the environment she is familiar with - Google Drive, and the changes are immediately visible: both on the site (when accessed from the Internet) and on the information terminal. <br><br>  And now about WiFi.  In the lobby, it works, connecting to the Internet without a password.  However, the access point itself is authorized in Traffic Inspector with ‚ÄúPupil‚Äù rights, which means that the user works on ‚Äúwhite lists‚Äù (we have about 2000 sites). <br><br>  I hope that this article will help in organizing an information system in your school. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/212591/">https://habr.com/ru/post/212591/</a></p>
