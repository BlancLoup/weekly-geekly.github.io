  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Computer Watergate</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> During the <a href="http://www.microsoft-watch.com/content/vista/microsoftintel_capable_collusion.html">trial</a> on the program Windows Vista Capable, at the end of February 2008, the court promulgated <a href="http://blog.seattlepi.nwsource.com/microsoft/library/vistaexhibitsone.pdf">158 pages from Microsoft internal documents</a> .  On the thirtieth page of these documents was the text of an email written by a Microsoft employee named John Kalkman.  It contained <a href="http://blog.seattlepi.nwsource.com/microsoft/archives/132891.asp">information</a> about certification in the program Capable chipsets from Intel.  ‚ÄúWe lowered the requirements specifically to help Intel raise its quarterly earnings figures.  Thus, they could continue to sell 915-chipset motherboards, ‚Äùwrote John Kalkman.  However, later, after some market research that yielded negative results, he notes that "it was a mistake to artificially underestimate the true graphic requirements." <br><br>  Wow news!  Two mega corporations, it turns out, were deceiving millions of their users by jointly providing incorrect data on the compatibility of their hardware and software!  Not surprisingly, Windows Vista reviews were not particularly flattering: not only did not every machine equipped with a Windows Vista Capable sticker allow you to work comfortably in the operating system, terrible brakes were observed, so a number of premium functions from top OS versions were just not available.  Official explanations about the letter Kalkman from both companies at the moment vague, they can be found below. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  1) Chuck Malloy (Chuck Mulloy) - a representative of Intel. <br><br>  Chuck Malloy said that John Culkman, not an employee of Intel, had no idea about the company's internal financial affairs or sales forecasts for chipsets, motherboards or any other products.  Therefore, the application should be considered as personal speculation.

      However, this answer is not a refutation of what is referred to in the letter of Kalkman.  And to the remark about this, Chuck Malloy reiterates that this kind of information is not for disclosure.  And again this is not a refutation, and the imagination is already drawing thousands of options, as Intel and Microsoft could agree secretly, bypassing all the laws. <br><br>  2) David Bowermaster (David Bowermaster) - a representative of Microsoft. <br><br>  A representative from Microsoft <a href="http://blog.seattlepi.nwsource.com/microsoft/archives/132891.asp">outlined</a> that support for 915 chipsets with Windows Vista Capable was based on successful tests of the beta version of Windows Vista on computers equipped with such a chipset, and also given the high prevalence of these chipsets in the market.  Windows Vista Home Basic can be installed on such computers.  For computers that allow the user to use premium functions of more advanced versions, Microsoft has authorized the use of the ‚ÄúPremium Ready‚Äù sign. <br><br>  Bowermaster deliberately diminishes the importance of the contents of the letter to Kalkman, while also not touching upon the possible agreement between Intel and Microsoft on the 915 chipset and its certification for use with Windows Vista.  The documents, released by the plaintiff, the representative of Microsoft calls "having nothing to do with the charges themselves," and explains that this is only part of an active discussion of how best to deploy the program Windows Vista Capable. <br><br>  It is a pity that only fragments of extensive conversations and lengthy discussions that do not give a complete picture of what is happening are made public!  These letters also touch upon the topic of ‚Äúmaking decisions and possible consequences for HP,‚Äù that is, the results of some agreements also affect OEMs.  Not surprisingly, Intel and Microsoft responded evasively, not admitting their guilt, even if it takes place.  However, it should be noted that none of the companies directly refuted the fact of collusion, and thus, instead of a dot and a story, dots were put. <br><br>  On the other hand, having intermittent chains of facts, we can assume several versions of stories, interlacing, overlapping each other, which will be taken for the truth of each of the parties to this conflict.  ‚ÄúWe lowered the requirements specifically to help Intel raise its quarterly earnings figures‚Äù is too simple to be true. <br><br>  <strong>The plaintiff's story</strong> <br>  From the side of the plaintiff the story would be simple.  Windows Vista Ready makes sense because its certified computers support all versions of Vista.  Windows Vista Capable - does not make sense, because certification of computers on which only one version of Home Basic can work normally is incomprehensible. <br><br>  The main piece of evidence in this case is a letter from Kalkman: Microsoft introduced the Capable program to justify the presence of the Intel 915 chipset in the Windows Vista compatibility program, while it only allows you to work with the Home Basic version and no other.  Based on other reports from published documents, the prosecution would have shown that other partners of Microsoft were against this fraud. <br>  Further, the prosecution would explain that Microsoft and Intel in this situation are interested in clearly covering and protecting each other, which they are busy with. <br><br>  The story is good.  So good that she could convince the jury.  But that would be too easy for such a confusing story. <br><br>  <strong>Intel history</strong> <br>  This story would remove the culpability in collusion with Intel.  In this story, Intel decides not to rush the release of products that support Windows Vista, putting Microsoft in a difficult position. <br><br>  This is Intel's choice to support Windows Vista or not.  Intel decides that the cost of changes required to support Windows Vista for their chipset is unreasonably high.  And the story for Microsoft acquires the following meaning: if Intel leaves the game, we are finished. <br><br>  As a result, Microsoft lowers the requirements in order to adapt to one of the most popular chipsets produced.  This fact of understatement could be represented, for example, in the following context: Mike Nash (Mike Nash), vice president of Windows Product Management, bought a laptop for 2100 bucks on the 915 chipset, and was surprised to find that he could not use all the features Windows Vista.  And in order not to lose such a huge user segment, which even Mike Nash entered, we had to certify the 915 chipset for the Windows Vista Capable program. <br><br>  <strong>Microsoft history</strong> <br>  The problem with this story was originally: nowhere in the published correspondence, none of the company's top officials refuted Kalkman's judgment that the requirements for certification of 915 chipsets were understated.  However, in another report sent a year before Kalkman‚Äôs scandalous letter, Mike Ibarra (Mike Ybarra) complained: ‚Äúwe are bending under Intel!‚Äù <br><br>  From the 158-page document, you can restore the chain of events that develops into a third story.  On November 9, 2005, Microsoft planned only one certification program.  David Berrett explained that ‚ÄúPC Ready‚Äù is the working name of the program, and the term that will be used instead of Ready is Capable.  Since the meaning of ‚Äúcapable‚Äù in English is more unambiguous and close to the meaning of the program. <br><br>  But in January 2006, something has changed a lot.  Microsoft officials actively discussed the removal of the WDDM standard (Windows Display Drive Model) from the Windows Capable program and the launch of the second Vista Ready program in June 2006. Next, more: Intel, in favor of its 915 chipset, puts pressure on Microsoft, demanding the removal of the WDDM standard. <br><br>  Immediately after this, Mike Ibarra writes in a letter that 18 months of work were wasted, and Microsoft has to substitute HP, which has already made serious investments in the implementation and promotion of the WDDM standard.  Other OEMs are also unhappy with what is happening.  Microsoft is forced to cave in under Intel. <br>  HP invested in supporting graphics accelerators of the WDDM standard, but Microsoft changed the program.  Naturally, HP is not happy about this fact. <br><br>  There is another version of the story that is inconsistent with the above, but it also has the right to life.  Information was received by an analyst from Microsoft representatives in early 2006.  Its essence is that Windows Ready was the main program, but the company initially also planned the second Windows Capable program.  A Microsoft representative also explained that Windows Capable is a program created at the request of OEMs who wanted a certificate, allowing them to sell cheap computers that are suitable for using Windows Vista. <br><br>  <strong>Summary</strong> <br>  And yet, the documents promulgated by the court are not complete enough to blame Intel for forcing Microsoft to take any action, although this is seen in the chains of facts. <br><br>  An interesting statistical calculation was presented by Microsoft, against which you can consider all the stories and facts.  In early 2007, the following picture was obtained in the market of graphic accelerators for the fourth quarter of 2006. <br><br>  <strong>60% of</strong> graphics accelerators on laptops and desktops supported the WDDM standard. <br>  <strong>30%</strong> had 915 chipsets from Intel. <br>  <strong>74% of</strong> laptops and <strong>58% of</strong> desktop computers had embedded video. <br>  <strong>86% of</strong> laptops were theoretically suitable for installing Windows Vista, but only <strong>46%</strong> of them could use the Aero-interface. <br><br>  In other words, less than half of the laptops at that time were fully prepared for the full-featured launch of Windows Vista. <br><br>  The story that developed after the events with the 915 chipset and the removal of the WDDM standard has not yet been told, and it may be impossible to tell it at all because of the many ‚Äúwhat-if-would‚Äù. <br><br>  Analyzing the published documents, it is safe to say that the software giant and its OEM-partners have lost at least 18 months of work on the graphical interface for Windows Vista.  And at first glance, it may seem that a sudden turn of events in January 2006 (rejection of the WDDM standard) set a lower standard, and one that is not good enough to meet the demands of Windows Vista and show it in all its glory with full functionality.  Hopefully, this was done not only for the benefit of Microsoft and Intel, but also had a deeper meaning, and was conceived solely for the convenience of users.  Although this option seems to me very much utopian, in the light of published facts. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/21531/">https://habr.com/ru/post/21531/</a></p>
