  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Reverse side of freedom of freelancing</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Freelance in the modern world is gaining momentum at a crazy pace.  Now for many people involved in programming, graphic design, journalism, translation, etc.  it is no longer just a form of work organization.  This is a way of life and even more - a philosophy of life. <br><br>  Such an increase in the popularity of freelancing is quite logical.  On the one hand, the work ‚Äúon the uncle‚Äù often does not allow to reveal all the existing potential, and on the other hand, the forces invested in the work and creative findings may not be appreciated, moreover, the author's results can even be appropriated by management.  But, probably, the decisive advantage of working for yourself is almost unlimited freedom of movement and the choice of work schedule.  You can do your job anywhere in the world with the presence of the Internet, and it does not matter if you are an owl or a morning person, you will choose the optimal working rhythm and deadlines for yourself.  And, of course, the financial side of the issue - you decide (naturally, with an eye on the established market), how much your work is worth, most often you do not reduce your earnings by the amount of taxes, do not spend money on the road and clothes to match the dress code, etc. what most often requires wage labor. <br><br>  It would seem solid pros.  But, of course, practically everything that concerns making money has its downside.  Freelance is no exception.

      First, the experience of remote work is not acquired immediately, and at first you will probably have to sweat considerably to find the right style of communication with customers and build up a customer base. <br><br>  Secondly, you will have to deal not only directly with the business that is your profession, but also to solve a whole range of organizational issues regarding negotiations with customers, check and control payments, etc.  To this may be added disgruntled relatives, who do not understand how to earn it, sitting at home at a computer, and waiting for your ‚Äúnormal‚Äù place of work, complaints from the other half, not wanting to wait for financial receipts from the next order, which is not there yet. <br><br>  And one more important point, which is often missed with a busy working rhythm "here and now."  It is about your financial independence in the future, about pension savings.  It seems to worry about it too soon, how much more time will pass.  But ask your parents, they will surely answer you that this, at first glance, immense period of time does not even pass, but flies by.  And you will inevitably face the problem: ‚Äúwhat should we live on now?‚Äù. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  It is clear that a freelancer should not count on a state pension, since there will not be enough completed work experience and contributions to a pension fund (state or non-state), which are made by the employer.  Of course, you can work, having formed as an individual entrepreneur, or to combine hired labor and work for yourself.  But this is no longer a freelance in its pure form, here you are unlikely to feel that freedom to manage your time and independence from government strings, that is, those advantages that are most valuable when choosing this form of work organization. <br><br>  The ideal option is to self-postpone, so that by the time of retirement a certain amount sufficient for a decent standard of living is formed.  But here lies a serious problem - the discipline of accumulation, because it is necessary to postpone it all the time, avoiding the temptations of even very necessary at first glance current spending.  One curious research on this topic ( <a href="http://www.avcadvisory.ru/puls-rynka/financial-news/znanie-razmera-buduschey-pensii-pomozhet-sozdat-sberezheniya">link to the article</a> ) showed that, it turns out, it will not be possible to defer methodically if one does not know what amount should be accumulated at the end of this process.  That is, when a person does not see a clear goal, in this case, financial, the motivation of his own discipline of saving turns out to be insufficient. <br><br>  Therefore, you should think about how you would like to live after retirement, now.  You just need to take time to analyze the current and potential available options for the formation of future capital. <br><br>  It is worth noting that now there are quite a few financial instruments and products that can help a person who is not too leading in matters of accumulation and future settlements to form the necessary capital that can ensure his materially prosperous future.  The main thing is to choose among them those that best fit your character and aspirations. <br><br>  And, most importantly, never stop there! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/213779/">https://habr.com/ru/post/213779/</a></p>
