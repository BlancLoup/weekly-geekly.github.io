    <h3>  Do not pull, can or not? </h3><br>  From <a href="https://lenta.ru/news/2016/02/23/calmdown/">1 April 2016, the</a> <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259C%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B6%25D0%25B4%25D1%2583%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B0%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F_%25D0%25B3%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B6%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B9_%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B0%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B8">International Civil Aviation Organization</a> (ICAO) approved amendments to the transportation of batteries. <br><br>  In fact, turned into a ban on the transport of batteries in the cargo compartment of passenger flights.  The ban includes rechargeable Li-ion / Li-Po (for mobile phones, laptops, tablets, video cameras, portable consoles and other equipment) and non-rechargeable Lithium metal.  However, the transportation of the latter separately from the equipment was limited from July 1, 2015.  Transportation outside of the equipment required prior approval from UPS Airlines. <br><br>  All anything, but the lion's share of private goods flies just passenger flights.  Let not on the whole route, but only on separate stages.  For example, <a href="https://www.ups.com/content/ru/ru/resources/ship/packaging/guidelines/batteries.html">UPS</a> accepts batteries in packages labeled ‚ÄúCaro Aircraft Only‚Äù.  And notifies: due to the fact that UPS uses passenger flights on certain routes of the transport network, some localities will be closed for sending or delivering lithium-ion batteries.  <a href="http://www.dhl.ru/ru/express/shipping/shipping_advice/lithium_batteries.html">DHL</a> completely refuses to transport the batteries without a separate notice (although it actively uses freight services). <br><br>  Saves that restriction does not apply to batteries packed together or inside the equipment.  The restrictions apply: <br><ul><li>  by quantity - it is not allowed to send more than one package only with batteries in one shipment. </li><li>  per transport package - in one transport package it is possible to place no more than one package with 2 batteries. </li></ul><br>  In this case, the battery must be packed separately from other goods.  Super slow, and very uncomfortable, right? <br><br><h3>  Previously, they sent?  What about send from China? </h3><br>  Problems did not appear today.  Similar rules, described earlier, were often ignored.  Although it is worth remembering the past and before last year: periodically parcels with lithium-ion batteries are not allowed for air transportation.  Totally.  Only by sea or land. <br><br>  Not surprisingly, there were certain limitations before the new ICAO decision.  In the USA, for example, in the same way it was possible to carry a battery only directly in the devices.  Allowed 2 batteries in the kit, and for the customs declaration - just for this device.  Total - 2 inside, 2 in the butt.  Maximum - 4 pieces.  Otherwise, the customs (!!!) of the United States will not allow the sending of either the battery or the device itself.  Separately, batteries and before, and now - only by sea / land. <br><br>  When delivering goods from other countries, private companies may have problems.  China Post is also subject to the rules of ICAO (as well as alternative mail of Switzerland, Sweden and Singapore).  Officially, it transports no more than one battery separately from the device, although the bulk of the parcels passes inspection and arrives to the buyers.  Most often packages with elements come to us by land through Kazakhstan / the Far East or by sea through Vladivostok.  By the way, devices with massive Li-Ion / Li-Po elements are also sent, for example, hoverboards. <br><br>  If you managed to get a package around the rules - it is really great.  Unfortunately, now this is not at all the norm, but a flaw in the postal and customs officers.  Is it worth the risk - it depends on you. <br><br><h3>  How do we carry </h3><br>  As you can see, the current rules for the transportation of batteries are not at all an invention of the mail forwarders (including us) or postal companies wishing to make more money on customers.  Since the main part of such cargo transportation is carried out with the help of free space in the cargo compartments of passenger flights, postal services and forwarders do not have direct permits for the transportation of batteries - they have to obey the decision of the ICAO. <br><br>  For the transfer of batteries and devices with batteries from the USA to Russia and the CIS countries, the following combination is currently recommended: <br><table><tbody><tr><td>  Shipping Method / Battery Type </td><td>  <a href="https://www.usps.com/">USPS</a> </td><td>  <a href="http://pochtoy.com/page/faq_express/">Express mail</a> </td></tr><tr><td>  Li-ion / Li-Po </td><td>  2 devices with installed batteries + two batteries = 4 batteries </td><td>  2 devices or 1 device + 1 battery = 2 batteries </td></tr><tr><td>  Lithium metal </td><td>  No more than 2 established </td><td>  Banned </td></tr></tbody></table><br>  The declaration must specify "gadget_with_battery_installed".  Regular batteries should be in the battery compartments.  Additional - in the packaging of the device (if it is not provided by the packaging, please warn - we will enclose). <br><br>  If necessary, you can use the sea shipping method.  We have it represented by the company " <a href="http://www.meest.us/rus/">Mist</a> ".  Unfortunately, it is impossible to bring a dozen batteries in one package through the ‚ÄúMist-More‚Äù - as practice shows, such packages at customs are mistaken for a commercial consignment of goods.  But 5 elements (and without devices), if the delivery time is not critical - will arrive in safety. <br><br>  If you have additional questions about the shipment of goods from the United States with <a href="http://pochtoy.com/">Pochtoy.com</a> - we will be happy to answer in the comments or personal messages. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/397453/">https://habr.com/ru/post/397453/</a></p>
