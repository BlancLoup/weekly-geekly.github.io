  <section class="page js-page"><h1>RBK Money: on the road to recovery?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The market of electronic payment systems is a bit like a madhouse: there is a Napoleon - Webmoney, a patient who considers himself a doctor - Yandex.  Money and other patients with the syndrome of schizophrenic psychosis, expressed in complete illogical thinking - such as Rupay.  About him, and will be discussed - because the case is atypical and to some extent even interesting. <br><br>  So, Rupay apparently realized that he was sick (you must admit that it was a great rarity for the mentally ill) and demanded another doctor.  In the role of a new doctor, RBC Holding, who took the patient on bail and even adopted him, gave him his last name. <br><br>  From that moment on, Rupay became RBK Money.  However, the course of treatment turned out to be longer than expected, and the announced Rupay extract (now RBK Money) was postponed time after time.  The onlookers were already tired of yawning and were ready to go home - as it is here - it happened (excerpt from the official release): <br>  ‚ÄúOn June 23, 2008, the start of the new RBK Money payment system took place.  From 2002 to the present, the system has been operating under the Rupay brand.  The new website is located at <a href="http://www.rbkmoney.ru/">www.rbkmoney.ru</a> .  Changes affected the logo and corporate identity.  At the same time, the set of basic functions of RBK Money has preserved the continuity of Rupay. ‚Äù

      Thinking that it would be necessary to once again stand up for the truth, I decided to check how true the plankton language of the press release was.  No sooner said than done. <br><br>  I go to the site <a href="http://www.rbkmoney.ru/">www.rbkmoney.ru</a> .  Well, I expected it to be worse.  A girl smiles at me from the main page, covering one eye with a bank card - a gesture in itself, though pretty, but rather dubious and ambiguous (what does she hide there - a fingal set by her husband, or is it a hidden advertisement of an ophthalmologic clinic?).  Only later, understanding the system, I realized that it was a subtle hint of the main advantage of RBK Money - the service for replenishing electronic wallets from a bank card of any bank in the Russian Federation. <br><br>  After enjoying the design of PayPal-style design in Russian, I decided to register.  The registration tab is located at the very top of the page.  I noticed that next to the menu item <a href="https://rbkmoney.ru/common/dpage.aspx%3FdynamicPageId%3Dhelp%26RN%3D/">"Help" there</a> is a similar item <a href="https://rbkmoney.ru/common/dpage.aspx%3FRN%3D/%26dynamicPageId%3Dsupport">"Support Service"</a> .  Ie, this is for those who are desperate to reach the support - in despair you press the ‚ÄúHelp‚Äù button, and an ambulance team with sal ammoniac and a 5-liter bottle of medical alcohol comes to you to restore emotional balance?  However, in fairness, I note that the support service answers fairly quickly - that by phone, that in the chat. <br><br>  Okay, back to our b ... brave payment systems.  So, I decided to register in the system. <br><br>  The registration procedure was similar to the program of psychological rehabilitation and consisted of 3 steps. <br><br>  Step 1 - enter data into the system.  Everything is very simple there and does not require special talent.  The system will ask you to enter the e-mail address to which your wallet will be attached, the last name and name of the user, as well as your chosen password and the date of birth of the user. <br><br>  At the 2nd step, they demanded that I come up with and enter a payment password - for better security, and at the 3rd step - to choose the level of the wallet.  By default, the system issues a ‚ÄúStandard‚Äù wallet, but you can ‚Äúorder‚Äù and ‚ÄúAdvanced‚Äù - to do this, you need to enter your passport data. <br><br>  Having registered in the system, I instantly received an e-mail, specified during registration, in the style ‚ÄúOh, dear car of a high esteem, etc.‚Äù, which contained an activation link.  Just like everyone else.  Followed the link - activated wallet.  Quite a nice interface, with a message from the developers in the dashboard. <br>  Encouraged by such a warm welcome, I continued my inhuman experiments on a live (now there was no doubt) payment system. <br><br>  As a curious person, I decided to check the purse replenishment service from a bank card. <br><br>  We go to the section ‚ÄúBank Cards‚Äù in the user's personal account, select the subsection ‚ÄúMy Cards‚Äù - click on the ‚ÄúAdd Card‚Äù button in the window on the right. <br><br>  Clicking on the button "Add card", we get to the second dialog box - where the system asks to enter the first 6 and last 4 card numbers ... Hmm ... Difficult to understand, but you can, thank God, the initial mathematics has not forgotten yet - smartly counted 6 on the left and 4 on the right , I entered the name of the cardholder and ... it is not clear why, a mobile phone (!!) As explained later in the RBK Money support service, such identification is necessary so that the employees of the bank that issued the card can (attention !!) call me back and ask ( phone!) I have it.  Well, forgive them this little weakness.  Still, the identifier here is Yes, when adding a card, pay attention to the ominous warning ‚ÄúAttention!  RBK Money Wallet should NOT be replenished from cards: Visa Electron and Mastercard Maestro. ‚Äù <br><br>  After all these sobbing sobs, I still added a bank card, after which I called the bank, where a stern girl asked for the card number and code word.  I remembered the game Cossacks robbers, but, given the seriousness of the moment (after all, it was about money, albeit potential), I kept laughing and called the required parameters with all the responsibility available to me.  The result - the card was able to bind (!!).  I tried to make a replenishment - it also happened! <br><br>  In general, I liked it more than I didn‚Äôt like it, everything is simple and understandable, as in a pharmacy, seriousness without excessive pathos.  Having fulfilled my almost medical duty as a researcher, I can say that the patient is more alive than dead. <br><br>  But the payment system is like a ‚Äúdouble-edged sword‚Äù, it is the link between the online store and the buyer.  From the point of view of the buyer, everything is not so bad, but is RBK Money convenient for stores? <br><br>  I will try to answer this question in the next opus on the topic ... </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/38746/">https://habr.com/ru/post/38746/</a></p>
