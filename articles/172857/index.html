  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Why do I buy subscribers using targeted VK ads?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  It is strange that there are few topics about it: either no one uses VKontakte advertising for this, or the theme is so (secret, complicated) ... <br><br>  So why: <br><ol><li>  I am 100% percent sure that the <strong>people</strong> who entered <strong>are living</strong> (the robot does not click on the ads). </li><li>  Everyone <strong>who subscribes is interested in the topic of the group</strong> (because no one pays them for a subscription).  My goal is to collect not just a million people anyhow, but let it be 30k targeted. </li><li>  <strong>It is cheaper</strong> than buying in other ways.  Depending on different conditions, 1k subscribers cost 400 - 1300 rubles. </li></ol><br>  Of course, using VKontakte advertising is more difficult than simply giving away a thousand and ‚Äúon slacker‚Äù to update group statistics, watching subscribers arrive. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  To launch the target VKontakte: <br><ul><li>  <strong>Choose your target audience</strong> (CA).  Of course, here in the interface of VKontakte a mountain of parameters, it may frighten someone, but it pleases me. <br>  Especially the "Groups" parameter. <br>  I think that I will not reveal a big secret here.  This option allows ads to be shown only to people who subscribe to specific groups. <br>  Suppose you decide to make a group for parents and are confident that your idea is the best implemented one.  But in the VKontakte profile (often) it is not indicated whether the person has children or not.  But in the half-million group "Yamama" (a speculative example), the parents certainly gathered.  Therefore, show your ads only to people from this group, and that's so easy, and (surprisingly) completely legitimately withdraw subscribers from a competitor group. </li><li>  <strong>Come up with an ad</strong> that should attract the target audience of your group, and not just be cool.  Its CTR depends on this, and ultimately the amount spent on the entire advertising campaign and the subscriber's price.  <em>For example, there were about 700k impressions with a CTR of 0.47 and a subscriber's total price of 0.6 rubles (Central Asia without socially demographic restrictions, but having a very narrow and rather rare interest)</em> . </li><li>  <strong>To create a</strong> group <strong>page</strong> , this greatly influences the number of people who joined the group from those who passed through advertising (calculated as: the number of subscribers to the group divided by the number of clicks on advertising) and ultimately, again, the cost of the subscriber.  <em>In my practice, this figure was from 0.35 to 0.6.</em>  <em>But in different forums I saw screenshots with indicators and 0.8.</em> </li><li>  <strong>Prepare a</strong> group <strong>avatar</strong> .  The number of entries is affected by: <br><ul><li>  <strong>The size of the</strong> avatar. </li><li>  Visual <strong>design</strong> avatar. </li></ul></li><li>  <strong>Check out the material of the</strong> group, at least 3 - 4 screens down.  If the material is not attractive or the number of those who have entered is unsightly, the number drops in, which, as a result, leads to an increase in the cost of the subscriber.  There are many aspects, so only a few: <br><ul><li>  one <strong>picture</strong> in the post looks boring, if there are many of them - there‚Äôs nothing to catch your eye on (attention disappears), we are looking for a balance; </li><li>  <strong>videos</strong> are watched less often, more than a minute are even less often ...; </li><li>  <strong>the text under the cut</strong> ("show completely") is read only by very motivated visitors, or if the material is very interesting, or if it is very attractive; </li><li>  women love <strong>gifs</strong> (at almost any age; unfortunately). </li><li>  <strong>polls</strong> attract voices, increase interest in the group, but give a minimum of likes or reposts.  Thus, they affect the number of subscribers to a group, but do not affect the viral distribution of group content. <br>  Monosyllabic polls, with variants of answers, such as "yes", "no" or "how much do you rate" and then the points attract significantly fewer votes than polls with detailed answers. </li></ul></li></ul><br>  <strong>The most dangerous job</strong> starts after you start advertising on VKontakte.  The danger is that due to the huge number of VKontakte users, <strong>you can squander any budget</strong> (and 1k, and 3k, and even 10k) in a few minutes. <br><blockquote>  By myself, I noticed that if you get carried away, there is excitement, comparable to playing in a casino.  Only here as a win the total number of subscribers that you want to get for as little money as possible. </blockquote><br>  <strong>It is necessary to manage the advertising campaign.</strong> <br>  Basically, management is reduced (and here I will not reveal a big secret) to a <strong>change in the price</strong> for 1k impressions or for 1 click so that the final price of the subscriber suits you.  Analyzing advertising statistics, I usually track 3 main and more than 3 minor indicators, the change of which indicates that you need to play around with the price or stop the campaign for a while.  If your price goes beyond the recommended - the number of ad impressions decreases or the reach of visitors (the ad starts to appear more often to the same users, which lowers the CTR with all the consequences).  And the recommended price depends on the number of advertisers currently in your segment of Central Asia.  Of course, here it is convenient to use different tools, ranging from Excel to specially designed software. <br><br>  In conclusion, here are <strong>some indicators</strong> that can be used to assess the effectiveness of your advertising company VKontakte: <br><ol><li>  Advertisement <strong>CTR</strong> ;  (from 0.2 to 0.6, average 0.35). </li><li>  <strong>Number of Subscribers / Number of Advertisers</strong> ;  (0.35 - 0.6, average: 0.45). </li><li>  <strong>Cost of 1 subscriber</strong> = (total amount spent on the advertising campaign / number of attracted subscribers);  (0.4 - 1.3, average: 0.6). </li></ol><br>  In parentheses, he gave an average of his work experience based on how many tens of millions of impressions, just to have some kind of guide.  I know that there are people who work much better.  On the other hand, my main specialty is the development of software, and this topic has been mastered only a bit since ...

      All prices quoted <strong>are costs</strong> , excluding the work of a specialist, tools, etc.  When the agency performs this work, the price rises 2 to 3 times, and if you have a limited budget and not a super-duper commercial public, the profitability of such a service for you falls.  If you still want to get a high-quality audience and at the same time save money, it remains <strong>to learn all of this yourself and experiment on a small budget</strong> .  I hope the above described will help you to find out where to start and in which direction to move. <br><br>  It is interesting. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/172857/">https://habr.com/ru/post/172857/</a></p>
