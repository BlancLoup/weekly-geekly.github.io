  <section class="page js-page"><h1>RBC advances in publishing</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  According to ‚ÄúHabrakhabra‚Äù, <a href="http://rbc.ru/">RBC Information Systems</a> Holding is preparing to release a new periodical, the newspaper RBCDaily. <br>  The business newspaper of the same name is known to <a href="http://www.rbcdaily.ru/">exist on the Internet</a> .  New RBCDaily will be coming out on paper. <br><br>  Yuri Rovensky, RBC CEO, said that the holding‚Äôs ambition was to open new print media, but he didn‚Äôt confirm the immediate appearance of the newspaper: ‚ÄúJudging by the number of rumors spread by the media, publishing has been booming.  They are talking about the purchase of Kommersant, Rodionov Publishing House, Glossi Publishing House, a new RBC project‚Ä¶.  This is all good evidence that the market is growing.  But how to comment on these rumors?  Of course, we do not exclude the possibility of expanding our presence in the publishing business - both by acquiring existing publications and by releasing new ones - but we have been talking about this for the whole year.  At the moment, we have not made a final decision. ‚Äù <br><br>  Nevertheless, they say that now in a new edition is actively recruiting staff.  Candidates are offered decent compensation, and they, leaving the previous places, go to work in RBCDaily.

      Hubrahabr asked Anton Nosik, the chief editor of <a href="http://www.mosnews.com/">MosNews.com</a> and <a href="http://www.gazeta.kg/">Gazeta.Kg, to</a> share an opinion on the possible appearance of the RBCDaily newspaper. <br>  <b>What do you think is due to the decision of RBC to go further into the publishing business?</b> <br><br>  On the one hand, this process is completely inevitable.  RBC successfully occupied and mastered the niche of business information in the most difficult and competitive segment - on the Internet, where thousands of alternative sources are available to the user.  RBC has learned to sell information, advertising and services in this niche market.  Having these skills, it is quite natural to search for them all new applications.  The success of the release of RBC in a television format is once again confirmed.  It would be strange for them to stop when everything turns out so well. <br><br>  On the other hand, it should be noted that there seems to be more psychology than commerce.  I have no doubt that RBCDaily will be more successful in both the Business and SmartMoney newspapers, because the project creators are able and love to make money, unlike their colleagues from Secret of the Firm and Independent Media, who are able and love to spend it.  Still, the campaign of RBC to the newspaper market seems to me more to be the realization of a cherished dream than a purely commercial calculation.  They obviously want to become the ‚Äúmasters of thoughts‚Äù of the business community, and, by tradition, brought up by ‚ÄúKommersant‚Äù, they still believe that the paper newspaper is ‚Äúmore authoritative‚Äù of the site.  I hold a different opinion, but I do not act as an investor in this project. <br><br>  <b>The printed production of the holding is vivid - there is RBC magazine.</b>  <b>Do you think this is a successful project?</b>  <b>What will be the continuation of the newspaper?</b> <br><br>  Most likely, the newspaper, when and if it appears, will position itself as a competitor of Kommersant and Vedomosti, and not at all as a continuation of the monthly magazine.  I can‚Äôt say anything about the magazine: he hasn‚Äôt a year yet.  We'll see Gallup closer to December, read the annual reports of the OJSC, then we can say how successful the monthly magazine is.  But the newspaper is another business at all. <br><br>  <b>Under what circumstances can an online publication gain a paper future?</b>  <b>What is the case with RBCDaily?</b> <br><br>  In the online edition of RBCDaily, there is not even a remote volume of materials needed for competition in the business press market in Moscow today.  Even to <a href="http://www.gazeta.ru/">Gazeta.Ru</a> , if you put it on paper, the volume would not be enough, although it is a completely full-fledged newspaper.  From the RBCDaily we know, only a name can be saved in a paper newspaper, and everything else will probably be built from scratch - by the very journalists who, as you say, have moved from competing publishing houses. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/4220/">https://habr.com/ru/post/4220/</a></p>
