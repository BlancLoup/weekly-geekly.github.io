Knowing that the project is promising, I decided that it would be of interest to you too, dear habrazhiteli.  You can <a href="http://reputacia.habrahabr.ru/">talk</a> more about the project with <a href="http://reputacia.habrahabr.ru/">reputacia</a> . <br><br>  Finally it happened!  Two weeks ago, the <a href="http://www.reputacia.ru/">Reputation</a> business portal (www.reputacia.ru) was launched, about the beta version of which we wrote on July 14.  The project worked hard for over a year, now we listen to criticism and praise with a sinking heart.  I admit, there are still enough skeptics, but this is exactly what helps us to develop and constantly think how to do better! <br><br>  If in a nutshell, we have created the so-called "People's rating of goods and services."  That is, for example, now, before choosing a bank for processing a loan or opening an account, you can look into us and make decisions based not on advertising information that companies themselves leave on many portals and in booklets, but having already reviewed reviews experienced clients, see the ‚Äúpitfalls‚Äù, consult with professionals in this field.  We hope that this will be the case in everything from the purchase of products to the registration of a mortgage.  We are trying to transform ‚Äúword of mouth‚Äù into a ‚Äúnetwork‚Äù, now ‚Äúhaving offended‚Äù one client, companies risk losing thousands. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In addition, we give employees the opportunity to speak out heartily about the company-employer, and this will also directly affect the place of the company in our ‚Äúhit parade‚Äù.  We want ‚ÄúReputation‚Äù to become a platform where both companies, their clients, and employees can not only leave their reviews and share positive and negative experiences, but also solve emerging issues and problems, build a full-fledged dialogue.  (Literally in the coming week, we will have free legal advice.)

      At the moment, a significant amount has been invested in the project, but in the near future the project will require additional serious investments.  We also all work exclusively on our finances, although quite recently a large enough investor became interested in the project, well, everything is still in the process of discussion .... <br><br>  Every day the site is viewed by more than 300 people, we understand that this is a tiny figure, but the portal has been functioning for less than a month and there is no active promotion yet.  The number of registered users is growing slowly but surely - about 10-15 people register every day, about half a thousand participants in total (this, together with those who are registered by invitation, are still in closed testing).  More than 1,500 reviews have been left, new promotions have been launched - a contest for the best review has been announced, the results of which we will summarize at the end of October and will reward the winners.  The site constantly updates the news, new impressions and comments appear - ‚ÄúReputation‚Äù aroused interest, and this is the most important thing for us. <br><br>  We know that everything is not as smooth as we would like, but we don‚Äôt have an ‚Äúoil rig‚Äù behind us and have to save on very many things, well, we‚Äôll break through with God's help! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/40224/">https://habr.com/ru/post/40224/</a></p>
