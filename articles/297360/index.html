According to the results of <a href="">your vote</a> , the topic ‚ÄúHow to negotiate with the Chinese?‚Äù Won with a significant margin.  This is what we will talk about next time (tentatively, in early January).  In the outgoing year, I would like to systematize and supplement another, <a href="http://sinocom.ru/blog/top-7-provajderov-telefonnyx-nomerov-kitaya/">previously touched upon</a> topic, about which I have been asked for the second month already - providers of virtual numbers in China.  For anyone who plans to open an office in a given country and is looking for acceptable, financially, options - I recommend reading. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  For a start, a little explanation of what virtual numbers are. </h3>
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      In fact, a virtual number is the same phone number as the one that is connected to your office device, with the exception of a number of points: <br><ul><li>  You did not pay for the services of the masters by connecting the phone number and did not wait for them to appear a week. </li><li>  You saved money by not installing a PBX, since all the costs of purchasing, upgrading and maintaining equipment for the provision of services are on the shoulders of the virtual number provider. </li><li>  Accounting did not beat the thresholds of a dozen instances to obtain permission to connect the number and did not expect two months to confirm. </li><li>  You can connect the number of any available city in Russia and abroad within one working day (for example, the virtual number of Moscow).  And for this, there is no need to physically be in this place or collect permits to carry out this action. </li><li>  If your office changes the location address, the virtual numbers will move with you.  At the same time, the numbers themselves in the process of your move continue to work and there is no red tape with the process of re-registration of documents. </li></ul><br>  In other words, a virtual number is a tool that allows you to quickly establish communication with customers and employees in any desired region and with minimal cost.  If we return to the issue of Chinese virtual numbers, this is an opportunity to sit physically in Kaliningrad or Uryupinsk, to open within one working day a virtual office in Hong Kong for $ 50 and quietly start trading the same day.  If you need phone numbers in Shanghai or, for example, Beijing, pay another $ 50 and continue to work.  It will not need to fly back and forth with a pile of papers and permits. <br><br>  Since there are a few more offers on the market today, quite often the question arises: ‚Äúwhy does provider A have a number, conditionally $ 20, and provider B has $ 40?‚Äù  In the list below, the tested providers are selected according to the following criteria: <br><br><ol><li>  The quality of communication - the absence or minimum amount of noise, clarity and volume of sound from 70+% of the norm. </li><li>  The quality of the rooms - uninterrupted or minimal number of failures.  Stable operation of telephone numbers within 24 hours. </li><li>  The level of support and service - the speed of solving all current issues. </li></ol><br><br><h3>  Based on this, the following list was formed: </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/90a/398/344/90a3983446f24d2db16f41e76fd16a43.jpg"><br><br><h3>  <a href="http://www.898tele.com/%3Fpk_campaign%3DMegamozg%26pk_kwd%3DArticle-CH4">1. 898Tele.com</a> </h3><br>  <b>Type of rooms:</b> urban, toll-free (numbers 800). <br>  <b>The list of available cities:</b> Beijing (+86 10), Hong Kong / Hong Kong (+86 852), Guangzhou (+86 202), Shanghai (+86 21). <br>  <b>Price segment:</b> medium. <br>  <b>Available:</b> China (no need to use VPN for purchase) <br>  <b>Provider Features:</b> <br>  One of the most popular providers, specializing in the sale of virtual numbers for Chinese business, entering the international arena.
