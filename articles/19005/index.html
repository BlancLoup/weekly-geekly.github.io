Help make habrastartap! ‚ÄùDomestic analysts attribute this trend to the fact that the crisis in the US mortgage market pulls down the market as a whole, forcing players on the stock exchange to invest in highly liquid and reliable assets.  Traditionally, investors in the troubled times are the refuge of gold, copper and startups in the former Soviet Union. <br><br>  What if there is no money and other resources yet, but today you want to feel like Deniskin or Andreev?  Let's try to fulfill the social order and try to quickly make a site resembling Habr. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  To begin, we will need no strict requirements for the number of requests to the database hosting.  The required minimum of memory is 16 MB. We download from the official site Drupal 5.6.  From there, we will draw the necessary additional modules. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      The installation is easy and reliable: you just need to enter the name of the database, the prefix for the tables, the login and password.  After the installation is complete, we are welcomed by the main page with the proposal to create the user # 1  This user will continue to have unlimited rights.  Thanks to the existing flexible rights management system, you can create different categories of users and assign them privileges to manage the content and structure of the site, but for some tasks, user # 1 is still required.  In addition to creating the first user, it is imperative to correct access rights to the configuration file and remove the install.php file.  Go to the list of available modules and add additional kernel modules to the included required modules: Blog, Comment, Menu, Path, Poll, Profile, Search, Taxonomy, Tracker, Upload. <br><br>  We create for the beginning 2 vocabulary: Kind of creative and tags of creative.  For the first dictionary, we create a set of tags: translations, podcasts, links ... We set the condition for the obligatory presence of a tag in the material from this drop-down list.  For the second set free multiple choice tags - users will independently set the tags in any quantity.  Both dictionaries are associated with a blog entry.  When creating a creative, the user will be prompted to select / enter tags. <br><br>  At the next stage, we will facilitate the users publication of the material.  I would single out 2 BUEditor and TinyMCE from a significant number of WYSIWYG editors, but since 2 editors for 1 site are a bit too much, we‚Äôll leave BUEditor at drupal.ru, and install the TinyMCE module for ourselves.  Here you need to understand that to work with text, in addition to the module, the editor itself is needed (it is easy to find it on the author‚Äôs website tinymce.moxiecode.com).  Create a profile in the editor for registered users, customize the visibility and the necessary buttons.  You also need to not forget about the set of allowed tags, otherwise users will be tortured with questions: ‚ÄúWhy does my table / picture not appear in the blog?‚Äù For convenient work with pictures, install the IMCE module, set up the necessary restrictions on the size and size of pictures.  IMCE works well with the above-installed WYSIWYG editor, but if you are a ‚Äútrue professional‚Äù, then no one bothers to turn off the editor and create tags without intermediaries. <br><br>  We will consider that we have already learned how to create creatives, now we will try to display them in the form we need.  Download and install the Views group of modules, as well as Vote up / down and Voting API.  In the settings of the Voting API module, we set up the most rapid update of the results, in the settings of Vote up / down, we tie the vote to the blog entry, set the vote in the form of + 1 / -1 (the buttons can be stolen in Habr√©;) or downloaded on famfamfam.com), we configure availability not only in the article, but also in teasers.  We make similar settings for voting by comments.  Speaking of comments.  In two clicks we include comments to blogs and do not forget to set their tree view. <br><br>  With Views, we create a page view for the main page.  This will be a regular list of 10 teasers.  The engine even has a ready habrakat (break).  Since only the most worthy of the current posts are displayed on the main page, we will filter them by voices and sort them by date of creation.  After the installation of modules for voting, more than a dozen filtering options appear in the filters, so you can filter as you please.  In the case of planned habrarevolutions, filters should be added to the check for published \ not published and, for example, for the role or name of the author.  This will be of great help in the future of the sweep - with several mouse movements, you can edit the past (the idea suggested by someone Orwell in the topic of retouching the past "1984"). <br><br>  To create a similarity of live broadcasting, we use a table view in a block, sort by the date of the comment, display the required fields: author, subject blog, name of the creative.  In the control of the blocks, we adjust the visibility and position of the live broadcast. <br><br>  I almost forgot about the most important element of the site - the tag cloud.  Well, that remembered, and then what would it be a Web 2.0!  It is implemented unusually dull and simple: install tagadelic and bind it to the dictionary.  Everything, the prefix 2.0 is ready. <br><br>  In this material, not a word is said about design, layout.  Yes, a lot of what is not said, only manipulations with modules are mentioned.  Hooks, snippets, and generally not a word about php were mentioned here.  In my opinion, if a person asks questions from paragraph 1, then he should begin with standard things.  And if you really have an idea, if you make an intelligent SITE for people, not regular classmates or the 125th YouTube clone, then everything will add - you will find resources for the original customization of open solutions, writing some kind of functionality from scratch.  And if the project ‚Äúdid not go‚Äù, then the matter is most likely not in the fact that you did not have enough $ 1,000,000 (an unnecessary amount of zeros to overwrite) for technical implementation. <br><br>  Already written, I caught myself thinking that they were not mentioned by the kind words of CNC, the implementation of companies and the community.  Ladnenko, it's time to finish, and then Saturday and so "too many letters." <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blog/drupal/35191.html">a continuation</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/19005/">https://habr.com/ru/post/19005/</a></p>
