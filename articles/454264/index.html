There and all sorts of strange things ala Business-Youth "How I earned n-money," but there are sensible videos too.  Here is my personal top: <br><br>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IWvbPIYQPFM">Mocap interview in Google for the position of back-end developer</a>

      <i>Briefly:</i> <br><br>  a) If you are asked ‚Äúabout yourself‚Äù, then tell about complex things that you did at work - integration or something that had your head smashed.  This will help to immediately focus on hard skills, then go to what teams worked, did you manage to manage people, and how did you communicate? <br><br>  b) Make a reaction to the person who is interviewing - if he is a recruiter and he is bored on technical details, go to another topic.  If this is a CTO / lead - pay attention to what technical details interest him.  Pay more attention to the task that he will give you and show the logic of your reasoning. <br><br>  c) Look to find out what task he gives at the interviews and how he is often solved. <br><br>  <a href="https://youtu.be/EcojyBV4QJ4">Why did he leave Google?</a> <br><br>  <i>Briefly</i> <br><br>  a) The average life of a developer at Google is 3.2 years. <br><br>  b) Google is not paradise.  When you start working there, you think, well, everything, I will stay forever.  And, of course, then it gets boring. <br><br>  c) From a large IT company you can go to a startup for a significant increase - there is more responsibility waiting for it and this is cool. <br><br>  d) Working at Google is cool because the company is changing the style of your life.  But not for all this is a working scheme.  Many junior developers leave Google less than a year after starting work, because this is a kind of validation check. <br><br>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pV7XIZnsbgM">7 typical mistakes of those who pass technical interviews</a> <br><br>  <i>Briefly</i> <br><br>  a) We need a person who is ready to vouch for you - to recommend you to the position.  Ask for help from teachers / colleagues.  They don't have to know you well, but be sure to attract other people.  It means more than you think. <br><br>  b) Do not be afraid to respond to the vacancy again and again if it appears.  Failures are normal.  He himself failed the Google interview three times. <br><br>  c) Do not talk too much about the code during the interview.  In fact, they can test your skills in a bunch of other ways, but if you know how to joke and how you communicate, you can only chat here.  Do not go into technical details, if you are not asked, better deftly joke. <br><br>  d) To prepare for the interview without fail is necessary, but also not worth overdoing.  You can prepare 2 good stories about your experiences and challenges that you took, well, and 2 stories that will tell more about you as a person and team member.  Otherwise, you will recall some important detail that you probably should have inserted into the story after the interview ended (yes, this often happens). <br><br>  d) If you were given a problem that needs to be solved, do not give it a whole hour.  Try to specifically tell and show (see the next item) how you would decide it.  If you need to clarify something - you will be asked again.  And, most likely, this is how the interviewer wanted to build a dialogue. <br><br>  f) Bring a notebook and a pen with you or ask on the spot - if you have a technical problem and you are asked to solve it, it‚Äôs generally worth taking and writing the code on paper.  You may not be hinted at, but in general this is the right thing to do. <br><br>  g) Analyze the task.  Ask what it is, why, how to help solve a problem globally - this is normal.  Nekruto, if you just try to throw a solution for the fact that you did not understand the essence.  "Uh, what are we doing here code?" <br><br><h3>  <b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNc-Wa_ZNBAGzFkYbAHw9eg">2. Channel interview.io</a></b> </h3><br>  This is the interviewing.io platform channel for interviewing and testing skills in the code editor.  In short, the guys just record interviews with team leads and unhappy candidates who solve the tasks given to them. <br><br>  Here are a couple of interesting vidos (for those who like to play the way others tinker with the code), which makes no sense to retell: <br><br>  <a href="https://youtu.be/cdCeU8DJvPM">Python developer at an Airbnb interview</a> <br>  Not super complex tasks like watching interesting. <br><br>  <a href="https://youtu.be/wyu6VRmtCmE">Another Pythonist at Google Interview</a> <br>  [appreciate how they are all merry here, and everything is harsh in Airbnb, and here the guy obviously has some answers, well, he goes to work with Google] <br><br><h3>  <b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxX9wt5FWQUAAz4UrysqK9A">3. CS Dojo Channel</a></b> </h3><br>  Another channel of the former developer Google, which also, of course, has a video about why he left the company.  Do not look, it is so-so.  But there are quite a lot of useful videos on how to prepare for solving problems that can give you at the interview. <br><br>  <a href="https://youtu.be/wgiW1uFZYr8">5 languages ‚Äã‚Äãthat will be needed for those who want to work in Facebook, Google, Microsoft and other IT giants</a> <br><br>  <i>Briefly:</i> <br>  - Javascript <br>  - Python <br>  - java <br>  - Swift <br>  - Ruby <br><br>  <i>The video was recorded in 2017, but it seems that nothing has changed criminally.</i> <br><br>  <a href="https://youtu.be/uQdy914JRKQ">How to pass an interview in Google</a> <br>  A detailed story about how to solve logical problems that can give you an interview. <br><br><h3>  <b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-91UA-Xy2Cvb98deRXuggA">4. Joshua Fluke Channel</a></b> </h3><br>  Joshua saws various videos about interviews and job searches (he is a full-stack developer).  And yet - answers to all the questions asked by subscribers.  This is full of videos for junior developers who are just starting to look for work.  Well, here are some interesting videos from the interviews themselves, which you can watch at a speed of 1.5: <br><br>  <a href="https://youtu.be/wVTIJBNBYoM">Telephone interview with google</a> <br>  A video that you can watch if you are preparing for an interview - they all look something like this. <br><br>  <a href="https://youtu.be/k9DWdXp1i0Q">Interview for a position with a salary of $ 120k per year</a> <br>  This interview with a recruiter from the agency, who did not even have time to talk about the details of the position.  Another logic, you can also listen.  The name of the company is not disclosed, nea. <br><br>  <a href="https://youtu.be/70Wcm5c7AF0">How I searched and responded to positions for which I lack the skills</a> <br>  In fact, it is useful to watch the video if you are considering changing a bit of a stack, but you are afraid that you will not have enough skills.  Pay attention to how he writes cover letters.  How it ended, however, is not entirely clear. <br><br>  If there is something cool that they are ready to advise - write in the comments, I will be glad.  Especially interested in the video about coding interviews for JS. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/454264/">https://habr.com/ru/post/454264/</a></p>
