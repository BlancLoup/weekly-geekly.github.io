  <section class="page js-page"><h1>On the pettiness of the rich</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Lord  Before you reprint from one closed blog with the consent of the author.  Although in the text below it is not about the IT industry, I think the topic will be close and understandable to almost anyone here, and the discussed issue is fully relevant to the IT industry. <br><br>  I myself design the ships.  I work in a normal office that builds boats for law enforcement agencies.  In my spare time I design any watercraft for everyone.  There were ordinary pontoons, and yachts, boats and sailing. <br>  Now about customers.  This is a topic for discussion.  I am surprised at some people from a certain stratum of the population who own a decent loot, at the same time they themselves are thinking of throwing me at ... 10‚Äì20‚Äì30 thousand rubles!  Not only do I do projects for very cheap by average standards, but there has not yet been a case when they would have paid in full.  Never.  While I restrain myself from sending everything to *** for one simple reason - I like and wonder what I do, like to see what I drew, see what is ready and what is worth my time and unreal nerves. <br>  So here.  I wondered why the rich are so greedy?  No, not all of course, but those I have personally encountered.  And greedy not for themselves, but for others.  When people arrive by car for 4-5 million and is trading for 10-20 thousand rubles calling this amount crazy money. <a name="habracut"></a><br>  After deliberation, I realized that the answer to the question ‚Äúwhy?‚Äù Is very ambiguous. <br>  My first thought: they are not greedy, they are cruel.  Many of the rich are from the dashing 90s, you should agree that capitals at that time were often earned on the verge of being called.  Kidalovo, wiring, grabbing, scam, stealing, and so on.  That is, the very first money of some rich people is cynical.  Remember the Rockefeller saying: ‚ÄúI can account for every million I earned, except the first.‚Äù <br>  All the first big capitals are one risky and lucky shot. <br>  Having understood that he is lucky, he is special, he is a demigod, and that the people are terpily and a flock, then the lucky one will not stop.  And the attitude towards others is like a cattle, from top to bottom, with contempt ... Hey, you are there, recycled, spent steam, draw a picture of what I‚Äôll order you and everything in that spirit.  I met with such.  Immediately interrupted any communication and contact, because the feeling after such scumbags so-so. <br>  I also saw others for whom money is some kind of illusion, something intangible.  For them, operations with money are always a game.  Saved, bargained with someone, even a thousand for a gasoline for your Merc is to increase your self-esteem, threw this burdock on the top ten, so he blame himself, he is a fool, and I am smart.  Increased self-esteem again.  Saw and such.  There are more. <br>  I saw how well-to-do people climb across the Internet looking for hacked applications for the background or wishing to jailbreak.  ‚ÄúAnd I don‚Äôt want to pay Cho, I want a freebie!‚Äù There was an episode in my life when successful successful people tried to squeeze 1/3 away from Khrushchev from a close, not so rich relative.  Etc.  The case can bring a lot. <br>  In general, money changes consciousness. <br>  I didn‚Äôt know about those rich people who spend millions on charity only in Forbes magazine and in the box, their true motivation for their actions, quite possibly this is a banal egoism and desire to show, see how good I am. <br>  No, I am not traveling, I can‚Äôt call myself a beggar, there is prosperity, which means I‚Äôm not biased, without envy. <br>  Who faced rich Buratino?  Share it.  Maybe all the miser comes to me? </div>
