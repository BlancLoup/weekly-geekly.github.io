What's up with the frontend?

      <i>Pause.</i>  <i>Everyone silently looks at the developer.</i> <br><br>  Developer: Listen, I'm actually a server developer.  Two months ago you asked me to make one button for this project and that's it!  And no one took any other tasks off of me.  And now it started, where the frontend is, where the frontend is ... I haven‚Äôt been on vacation for two years.  Where is the frontend? <br><br>  <i>Pause.</i>  <i>Everyone silently looks at the manager.</i> <br><br>  Manager: What am I?  I have no people.  We are looking for half a year for the front-fender, and that's all.  And the terms from me require!  Let HR tell us why there is still no person. <br><br>  HR: Over the past two weeks we have seen six candidates.  Ivanov wants 300 thousand, Petrov merged, Milich does not fit, Sidorov doesn‚Äôt know backend, Vasilyev is out of town, Filippov is old, he will be in summer 32. <br><br>  Manager: How did Petrov merge?  We wanted to make him an offer. <br><br>  Timlid: Yes, it is still ugly so merged, he said that he would not do the third test task, allegedly he had no time.  Well, that he fell off himself, then would have suffered enough with him.  According to Vasilyev, I am against, he is from the region.  Well what?  We are a springboard for him.  Work with us a year and will go down to 300 thousand, like Ivanov. <br><br>  Manager: Well, it‚Äôs clear with Ivanov, we don‚Äôt have 300 thousand, but what‚Äôs wrong with this Milicz? <br><br>  Timlid: Milic is her.  I am against girls to take.  No, I'm not a male chauvinistic pig!  We will teach her everything now, and she will dump it on maternity leave. <br><br>  HR: She already has a baby. <br><br>  Timlid: Well, especially since she has a child, laundry, diaper, kindergarten! <br><br>  HR: Is she wearing a diaper over your table? <br><br>  Timlid: How old is she?  thirty?  Well, it means the second decree will go.  Not!  We need a man for a long time. <br>  Director (answering the bell): All quiet!  This is the customer!  Good afternoon, Sergey Ivanovich!  How, again, does not work?  That writes?  And what browser did you open?  In the explorer?  It should be in chrome.  Do not like chrome?  I will tell the guys, they will finish it.  Yes, yes, remember that in a month.  Yes, and correct the colors, our designers are working on it. <br><br>  Developer (smiling sadly): Designers - is it me too? <br><br>  Timlid: Yeah, you too.  You are the front, back and designer.  I said I had to look for a full-stack.  In the resource plan wrote. <br><br>  Manager: I do not remember that.  Let's see the resource plan.  Alexander Viktorovich, please open the letter from me with the subject ‚Äúplan‚Äù.  No, "resource plan." <br><br>  <i>The director unwraps the monitor, shares mail on the screen, starts rummaging through all the folders.</i> <br><br>  Director: I will find it now.  I have 100 letters a day without your plan!  When did you send it? <br><br>  <i>Solemnly retrieves an unread message with the subject ‚Äúresource plan‚Äù from the spam folder.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>HR, the manager and team leader loudly and irritably swear among themselves, looking at the monitor.</i> <br><br>  Director: All out!  Understand each other!  So a week later, the front-end sat. <br>  Manager (refers to the developer): Well, you have this, until we have found the front-end, finish there.  Color at least look, fonts.  Yes, another customer wants pop-ups.  I did not say?  Well, now I say.  Yes, and cross-browser compatibility.  Yes, it was not in the TZ, but the director was talking to you right now!  So come on, do, deadline - yesterday. <br><br>  Developer (whispers in HR's ear): ‚ÄúOn your own‚Äù is it written with two ‚Äún‚Äù? <br><br>  Familiar situation, right?  Let's understand, breaking the problem into two main categories: managerial mistakes of managers and problems with resource planning. <br><br><h3>  Executives mistakes </h3><br>  Selection of candidates by criteria <b>not related to their professional skills</b> .  Weeding out suitable specialists in such characteristics as gender, age, nationality, place of residence, stereotypes and cliches that the manager without hesitation applies to all candidates.  It is very difficult to form a team of 25-year-old blond male beasts with a Moscow residence permit in the current realities of the labor market.  The search eventually delays. <br><br>  <b>Greed.</b>  The manager's confidence is that if you search, you will definitely find a ‚Äúsignor‚Äù who agrees to work for the ‚Äújuna‚Äù salary.  If for this you have to look for a year, well, then there is time.  ‚ÄúBut in 2001 I received 15 thousand and lived on them!‚Äù Questions about how much in 2001 cost a dollar, a communal flat or a bottle of beer are not taken into account.  As well as why does a person go to your 70 wages if he easily finds an offer for 120 on the market. <br><br>  Many managers have <b>high expectations</b> regarding the competitiveness in the labor market of their current team and the relevance of their tasks.  Remarkable descriptions of the requirements for an applicant from the ‚Äúknowledge of all programming languages‚Äù series in a vacancy with the tasks of a coder are, of course, one of the symptoms of this problem. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xa/nk/31/xank31_171zn-kdiqajymnwbhzi.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  Choosing a candidate, the manager takes responsibility and carries risks.  Hence, there are <b>doubts about the correctness of the decision</b> .  How many questions do not ask at the interview, how many do not give the candidate test tasks, you will not get all the answers.  It seems that if you look at more candidates, the decision will be easier: ‚ÄúI want three or four interviews a day, we will see about twenty people, and then I will choose.‚Äù  The leader expects that one of the applicants magically "torknet" that this is the same ... And the problem of choice will be removed by itself. <br><br>  <b>Problems with the team.</b>  The team does not want a new man and actively resists.  How can this be?  For example, because of the bonus system, in which the larger the team, the lower the bonus.  A limited number of interesting problems, which is why everyone is afraid of the new distribution in favor of the beginner.  Head-daffodil, clasping employees foreheads, encouraging intrigue. <br><br><h3>  Planning issues </h3><br>  Resource planning is a difficult, ungrateful thing, and it is subject only to the coolest and most experienced managers.  What is the resource plan for?  For the correct calculation of margins, the timing of the project and planning the load of employees.  With unprocessed resource planning, part of the team will be underloaded, the other part will be constantly reworked.  As a result, from a smooth, beautiful, but <b>not related to reality, Roadmap is</b> obtained the same unviable recruitment plan. <br><br>  The cost of illiterate planning may be the following situations. <br>  Finding an employee is a ‚Äúcrutch‚Äù, a temporary solution taken to eliminate a local problem, and everyone understands this well.  The question of how to take a specialist further, after the problem is solved, begins to torment the team leader long before the interview.  Dismiss?  Download routine?  Retrain? <br><br>  In the process of working on a project, it turns out that the Roadmap is a curve and we are not looking for someone at all.  The manager did not consult with the team leader, or did not understand anything and scored.  Well, this is not the most terrible situation, if it, of course, did not occur during someone's trial period.  There are only 3-4 meetings on the topic ‚Äú <b>who are we really looking for</b> ‚Äù, the renegotiation of a vacancy, half a year of work for an HR dog. <br><br>  <b>In fact, no one is needed</b> .  It is enough to decompose the tasks, maybe, to attract outsourcing or free resources from another team.  Vacancy opened, selection allowed, hurray!  And what to do with a man?  Well, let's just look at the market, if a genius comes in and a new operating system writes to us. <br><br>  On the project, <b>everything is</b> already <b>so bad that only a magician will save the situation</b> .  Gandalf from development, capable of magic to turn a shaky building of "crutches" and "bicycles" in a fault-tolerant scalable system.  In this case, ‚Äúknowledge of all programming languages‚Äù is no longer a show off, but an objective necessity.  The problem is that the salary expectations of the magician do not fit into the budget after the project has turned from a commercial into an investment one.  Signor's salary is 250-300K, and this, you know, is a million from the project budget for one trial period only. <br><br><h3>  What to do with all this? </h3><br>  HR Manager - to prevent the existence of hanging vacancies such as "red spot", an endless storm in the atmosphere of Jupiter, observed since 1665.  It seems that the stain is reduced, but it is not accurate.  The director is not an all-seeing One, and may forget about what you are looking for a year as a front-endder.  The situation is complicated if HR and decision makers for vacancies are in different weight categories.  What can you do, you should be able to work with any managers, with forever busy, with TOPs, shareholders. <br><br>  The project manager is engaged in resource planning.  Analyze the structure of work, it is realistic to analyze, and not to hastily reduce the figures taken from the ceiling after the director promised to close the selection to anyone who does not provide a resource plan.  Estimate the amount of labor required to meet the budget and deadlines without losing quality.  Calculate the number of professionals with the necessary qualifications and experience.  The lack of resources is certainly a universal excuse for delayed deadlines.  "There is no one to work with me, period, understand HR, they cannot find an analyst for the second year."  At some point, the director simply gets tired of listening and then heads will fly. <br><br>  And back to the office, because the front-endder has not yet been found, and the lead developer ran to collect things along with the <s>source code in the</s> workbook.  What a manager can do in such a situation: <br><br><ol><li>  Revise the roadmap, analyze the remaining tasks.  According to them to recalculate the labor costs, on the basis of the received number of hours to determine the required load. </li><li>  To decide on the qualification of a specialist.  Calculate the effectiveness of outsourcing, perhaps it will be cheaper. </li><li>  Conduct a conversation with the team leader and the manager that xenophobia narrows the search range. </li><li>  Talk with the developer, perhaps write him a premium to maintain morale. </li><li>  To request a weekly report with HR, to talk with him about the timely information about the hung vacancies.  Put a deadline for the selection. </li></ol><br>  Write in the comments, how would you decide the case. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/455555/">https://habr.com/ru/post/455555/</a></p>
