    <h4>  Profit of enterprises </h4><br>  Corporate income tax is planned to be gradually reduced from 25% to 17%: in 2011 to 20%, and then every year by 1% until 2014, when it reaches the level of 17%. <br><br>  Decrease in pressure by 8% is quite a significant figure. <br><br><h4>  Change in VAT </h4><br>  It is planned to reduce the VAT rate from the current 20% to 17%; <br><br>  In the new code, there are two rates - 17% and 0%.  In addition, the number of business areas that are subject to this type of tax has been significantly reduced. <br><br><h4>  National taxes </h4><br>  It is planned to reduce the number of national taxes from 29 to 17, to abolish 10 local taxes and fees. <br><br>  What exactly - just could not figure out. <br><br><h4>  Tax on personal income </h4><br>  15% tax is retained for personal income.  It should also be noted that for nat.  persons with an income level of more than 50 thousand UAH plan to install 17% <br><br><h4>  New taxes </h4><br>  It is planned to introduce a 5% tax on interest calculated on the deposit, which does not cause much joy, given the current rates on deposits. <br><br><h4>  Changes in the simplified system </h4><br>  It is planned to reduce the number of enterprises that can benefit from the simplified taxation system. <br><br>  It is logical to ban the gambling business, foreign exchange operations, wholesale trading activities, foreign economic activity, real estate transactions, auditing, consulting, etc.  - i.e.  in fact, all those areas that have significant financial resources in circulation. <br><br>  As for the advertising activity as a whole, it is connected with the increased popularity of this type of business.  Apparently, online advertising also falls under this item. <br><br>  Regarding Internet commerce, the authorities decided that earnings in the Internet business are the same incomes of individuals as wages. <br><br>  Without setting limits, above which the possibility of using a simplified system is lost - this is certainly a minus. <br><br>  It is a pity that the authorities did not take into account the experience of some countries in which the entrepreneur does not pay taxes when he opened a new business.  Although given the mentality, most likely the company would simply be created for the new. <br><br><h4>  Total </h4><br>  In general, there are shifts for the better.  However, it should be noted that barriers to entry into the market of new enterprises are increasing. <br><br>  Also, unfortunately, you can forget about making money on the Internet without taxes.  It should be noted that the new code will affect a number of Internet providers that enjoy the right to simplified taxation. <br><br>  Of the unpleasant innovations, a new tax on deposits of 5% should be noted - although not much, but still unpleasant. <br><br><h4>  Paradox </h4><br>  According to the law, double taxation in Ukraine is prohibited. <br><br>  But if you look at the section, we get the following: <br>  1) we buy raw materials, which may include VAT <br>  2) we sell goods and pay VAT to the state (VAT from sales minus VAT in the cost of raw materials, etc.) <br>  3) part of the cash as profit is taxed by the SPE <br>  4) GMP in a deposit account and subject to deposit tax <br>  5) to pay the RFP, we count the fund and pay deductions from the Social Insurance Fund, the Federal Tax Service, etc. (38% +) <br>  6) charging the salary we pay individual tax <br>  7) go to the store to buy goods for earned salary and pay VAT again <br><br>  Therefore, the "double" must be understood precisely as two-fold, and not multiple ... <br><br>  Who is very interested in the whole range of innovations and changes, I recommend <a href="http://news.liga.net/news/N1016917.html">reading the draft presented at the meeting 09.06.2010</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/284520/">https://habr.com/ru/post/284520/</a></p>
