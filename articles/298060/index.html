I made 49 when the whistle sounded, announcing the end of the time allotted for this exercise.  Now my group had to pass the next test - pulling up.  But I felt defeated.  I already knew that the test failed due to push-ups, so why continue?

      Frustrated with myself, I was just going to sit out while others do this exercise.  But the trainer ordered me to rise and continue the test.  And not just to continue, but to give everything in full.  This meant two hours of hard work, which, as I already knew, would not bring a positive result. <br><br>  And this was not the last time that the FBI pushed me into the obstacle course.  I had to face such obstacles that seemed completely insurmountable, at least from the first attempt.  But just this experience taught me that it was precisely attempts to overcome existing difficulties that prepared us for <a href="http://testutor.ru/blog/znanie-inostrannyx-yazykov-i-uspeshnost-est-li-svyaz/">future success</a> ‚Äî if not this time, then the next ‚Äî certainly. <br><br>  This is called willpower.  And in this article I want to share with you five secrets that helped me personally in bringing up this very force of will. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">1) Keep your goal under review</font> </h2><br>  To activate your willpower, you must constantly remind yourself why this particular case / goal is important now.  If you are busy with any work or small assignments, the result of which does not mean anything - you will not develop the willpower here.  That is why it is so hard to get together and start a project that you hate, which is simply not interesting.  It was easier for me: I knew that I wanted to become an FBI agent, and this filled all my actions with meaning every day. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">2) Do not cut corners</font> </h2><br>  Somehow I had this experience.  During my jogging classes at the Academy, I decided to make it easier for me to reduce the distance by cutting corners when cornering.  It was not so difficult to do this, since I was running one of the last, and the treadmill did several sharp turns.  Unfortunately (or fortunately ?!), the coach saw it.  He made me come back (which already increased the distance) and take turns right.  Since then, I firmly learned: cutting corners does not shorten the distance to the target, but increases the time spent on achieving it. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">3) Train your brain</font> </h2><br>  The word "meditation" may sound strange from an FBI agent.  But for the first time I understood the importance of the ability to free my brain from all unwanted thoughts and emotions during shooting training.  The best shooters are those who can enter into a trance and fully focus on the target.  Some people characterize the process of the shot - the meditation moment.  But the same principle says: <a href="http://testutor.ru/blog/kak-nauchitsya-sebya-kontrolirovat-i-nachat-zhit-toj-zhiznyu-o-kotoroj-vy-mechtaete/">control your thoughts so that you can focus properly</a> . <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">4) Practice persistence and consistency</font> </h2><br>  Having forced to complete the sports test, after I failed, the trainer carved the following mantra in my thinking: ‚ÄúI will not back down.  If I find myself knocked down, I will rise and continue the fight.  No matter how many times.  I have everything I need to achieve the goal. "  During my studies at the Academy, I regularly encountered unfamiliar things, and fate threw me a challenge after a challenge.  Not always, I saw the finish line at the beginning.  But: practicing <a href="http://testutor.ru/blog/uchimsya-uchitsya-prostye-i-effektivnye-sposoby/">perseverance and consistency in achieving the goal</a> , I learned to generate successful strategies that moved me forward. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">5) Change your mindset - as often as life demands.</font> </h2><br>  When you have to make quick decisions, sometimes at gunpoint, quickly learn that stereotypes and one-sided outdated approaches to business do not solve the problem.  Practice your flexibility of thinking, do not be afraid of non-standard solutions. <br><br>  Everyone in life has moments akin to my physical fitness test for FBI - a complex project at work, a responsible exam, etc. But, if you want to take something from this article for yourself, then take this thesis: <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">You are much stronger than you think about yourself.</font>  <font color="#0071c5">You can do this.</font> </h2><br><br>  PS We recommend another useful article on the work on oneself - <a href="http://testutor.ru/blog/kak-izlechitsya-ot-bolezni-otkladyvaniya-na-potom-pri-izuchenii-yazykov-ili-prokrastinacii-boj/">How to recover from the disease of ‚Äúpostponing for later‚Äù when learning languages, or ‚ÄúProcrastination - fight‚Äù</a> . <br><br>  The author of the translation is Vyacheslav Davidenko, the founder of the <a href="http://testutor.com/">TESTutor</a> company. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/298060/">https://habr.com/ru/post/298060/</a></p>
