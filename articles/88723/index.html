  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Enterprise Content Management - how to make the right decisions quickly?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  With the development of information technology, the success of companies and organizations increasingly depends on the effectiveness of methods of working with unstructured information - documents, e-mail, electronic forms, all that is the main information entities in modern business.  Today there is a revolution in the worldview in which unstructured information ceases to be a product of business, and becomes a highly efficient business tool. <br>  On the effectiveness and foresight of the strategy in the management of unstructured information depends largely on the productivity of the organization as a whole.  So, already now for many large and medium-sized organizations, the solution of tasks for managing unstructured active content, coupled with business process technology, can be significantly associated with the use of the functionality of a specialized Enterprise Content Management platform. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="http://www-01.ibm.com/software/data/content-management/images/launch/agile-ecm-learn-530x140.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The main task of the ECM platform (Enterprise Content Management, corporate content management) is to automate the processes of working with information and content, both in the storage and use of content, and in the automation of documentary business processes. <br><br>  The modern market offers a variety of approaches to solving these problems, but now we will talk about the <a href="http://www-01.ibm.com/software/ru/data/content-management/agile-ecm/index.html">Agile ECM</a> paradigm from IBM.  Agile ECM is an adaptive technology that helps to organize the most efficient way of working with unstructured information and has built-in analytical capabilities and business process management capabilities, which allows you to increase the flexibility and efficiency of your business by providing the data you need to make critical daily decisions - when This data is most needed.  This is a great competitive advantage in making quick and, most importantly, the right decisions. <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/QVJaxEZZzMQ&amp;xid=17259,15700002,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhgsaLYqgDUgU16hJ9XiefGCHXBmBw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  IBM Agile ECM solutions are complex and allow you to simultaneously solve four types of tasks: 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>

      <br>
      1. Content management.  In addition to the basic capabilities for managing corporate electronic archives, Agile ECM uses active content technology, which implies the ability of the system to automatically respond to events occurring with stored documents (objects).  Using improve the accuracy and relevance of information used to make decisions.  Control over information and automation of processes will help ensure ‚Äútransparency‚Äù of processes and more effective accounting for stakeholders. <br><br>  2. Business process management.  Business processes must be efficient, they must integrate employees, business systems and information.  An approach that IBM uses to manage corporate content combines business process management and data management capabilities.  This approach allows you to activate content in applications and implement solutions based on events and available information.  This approach will help make the right decision, even if the corresponding event occurs for the first time. <br><br>  3. Regulatory Compliance Management.  Corporate governance and compliance mandates have led to an increase in the number of omissions due to the emergence of many new regulatory documents and law enforcement initiatives.  What is needed is a flexible approach that helps make informed, cost-effective decisions.  Each compliance mandate contains its own set of requirements, but all have one common feature: the need to provide a higher level of transparency and control over content and processes to reduce risk.  IBM Compliance Management products enable you to archive and manage e-mail and other e-mail messages (such as records), helping to ensure compliance and reducing storage management costs. <br><br>  4. Search for information.  To make effective and timely business decisions, companies must provide access to the necessary information to brainworkers, managers, customers and partners.  To maintain competitiveness, it is necessary to differ favorably from others.  This can be achieved by turning passive content stores into active sources of business information through reliable and user-friendly solutions for searching, classifying and analyzing content.  After gaining control over unstructured data, it is possible to make better decisions, allowing you to increase customer satisfaction and achieve the desired results. <br><br>  The core of IBM Agile ECM solutions are the <a href="http://www-142.ibm.com/software/products/ru/ru/filep8plat/">IBM FileNet</a> and <a href="http://www-01.ibm.com/software/data/enterprise-search/omnifind-enterprise/">IBM OmniFind</a> product lines. <br><br>  To effectively manage information, processes and regulatory compliance, IBM offers an integrated platform that provides not only the stable interaction of the above solutions, but also integration with a wide range of IT systems and products on the market (for example, the platform is excellent integrates with Lotus Quickr, MS SharePoint, Lotus Symphony, Microsoft Office, SAP, and also supports the XML format), thereby reducing costs and increasing efficiency. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bdb/17f/71c/bdb17f71cd9d3af8ffd0261232c40b21.png" alt="image"><br>  IBM Agile ECM solutions are marketed under the motto ‚ÄúMake the right decisions quickly‚Äù and this is not by chance.  This motto has become a reality for companies that, using these solutions, better serve customers, use labor more efficiently, get a significant return on investment - and all thanks to proper management and timely delivery of information. <br><br>  Useful links: <br>  <a href="http://www-01.ibm.com/software/ru/data/ecm/products/">IBM ECM</a> <br>  <a href="http://www-01.ibm.com/software/ru/data/content-management/agile-ecm/index.html">IBM Agile ECM</a> <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/XNQ6H7MyzQM%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700002,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhiYr-7zLHtNarqxSCWN-YTaNOtjKQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/88723/">https://habr.com/ru/post/88723/</a></p>
