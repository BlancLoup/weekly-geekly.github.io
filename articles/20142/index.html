  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Linux switching</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  On the 3rd of January, coming to his senses from the meeting of the New Year and the new laws, Sten critically examined his computer and realized: ‚ÄúIt will take a good and long time to sit.‚Äù  From the "honest" software on the car was found PAR and Winamp. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Inhale-exhale.  We begin to think where to crawl. <br>  Sten'a ended his experience with frivarnyh systems in 2001, and if about the FreeBsd of those times he still remembers with pleasure, then dances with a tambourine around setting at least 85 hertz in Gnome-RedHat still have nightmares. <br>  Of course, first of all, links to all Linux distributions were outgunned.  MacOS was also tested (interestingly!), But since  with the Nvidia GF 8500 GT video card, he doesn‚Äôt know how to work, and 60 hertz on a CRT (yes, Sten thinks with horror about time when his iIyama VisionMaster Pro 413 dies), and it‚Äôs not free software ... <br>  The next distribution was a Mandriva distribution.  My desktop animal, Microsoft Notebook Optical Wireless Mouse 4000, was recognized by the system only after turning off / on the receiver on an already loaded system. <br>  The next formatting section.  Gentoo, hello and goodbye.  SATA Vinci are mounted only in ridonly, mana read in the evenings after work - this is not for a novice switcher. <br>  Double 3. Ubuntu 7.10. <br>  Carefully (8 cans of beer) prepared, Sten sat down at the computer, and morally tuned to the next problem. <br>  Download from LiveCD was successful.  Oddly enough - and the installation ended successfully. <br>  We are loading.  Immediately see the proposal to put the drivers on the video - please. <br>  We expose 85 hertz (for a start).  Works! <br>  Okay, what about the periphery?  Here Sten slowly takes off from the fact that his good old TV tuner, which has never been started on this machine due to the incompatibility of the drivers, confirmed by the manufacturer (MSI), was perfectly defined. <br>  ‚ÄúHmmm ...‚Äù - said Sten in his beard ... <br>  It took 2 hours and 4 liters of beer.  ‚ÄúWell, why by default GRUB will load Ubuntu and not Win, I will decide and set it up tomorrow,‚Äù Sten told himself and went to sleep. <br>  However, the problem of choosing the OS manually arose from Sten on the strength of 2 times per month - when Photoshop was needed. <br>  Kopete successfully replaced Miranda, Firefox &amp; Thunderbird remained familiar, VLC did the same, Amarok fell into place instead of WinAmp. <br>  Of course, it was not done without fine polishing with a velvet file, such as transcoding tags in mp3 files from Win-1251 to UTF-8, loud mats addressed to Adobe, which just recently released a flash player under x64, humility with the absence of Skype under x64 (Sten from the principle there will not be a 32-bit distribution for the 64-bit distribution purely for compatibility) ... <br><br>  Now, after installing Mac4Lin, getting a full-fledged Mac-like desktop <br>  and launching Photoshop CS2 under Wine (do you have to do Sten'y until at least GimpShop under x64 is collected?) - the switch is over. <br><br>  BTW, Sten'a of the left software has only a stumbling block for everyone who works with graphics.  Yes, FSH.
