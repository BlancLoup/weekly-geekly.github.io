Simply put, this is an online designer selling mini-sites for entrepreneurs and individuals. <br><br>  On April 27, I received a message from my client that his website, a business card about the company on the implementation of water works, is being blocked by the antivirus Dr.  Web as a ‚Äúnon-recommended site‚Äù.

      The text of the correspondence with technical support was attached to the letter (request YHZJ-0382): <br><br>  <i>REQUEST:</i> Hello!  The second year I am a registered user of Dr.Web.  Antivirus was always pleased.  But today I tried to enter my own website *** and saw the message: URL blocked by SpIDer Gate as a non-recommended site.  I made my own website and I make all the changes myself.  Nothing harmful on it can be.  I am very surprised.  Please give an answer for what reason my site is blocked? <br><br>  <i>ANSWER:</i> The ip-address is included in the list of non-recommended Dr.Web *** And our analysts do not consider it possible to remove it from the acc.  blacklist.  There are a lot of resources with dubious content, plus the *** service for creating new ‚Äúchlampackets‚Äù. <br><br>  Oh wow!  My service has caused such close attention of analysts that it was very "objectively" and "reasonably" called the "service for the creation of chlampackets."  And as a punishment, analysts decided to block a whole IP address with 500+ client sites and other service-independent sites ‚Äî for example, my blog. <br><br>  I call technical support to resolve the issue.  I describe the situation with false blocking sites.  In response, I hear that ‚ÄúThis is a question for analysts.  They do not communicate by phone, write a ticket in support. ‚Äù <br><br>  I am writing a ticket to support (request # 3348329): <br><br>  <i>REQUEST:</i> Hello.  I am the owner of the service for the rapid creation of pages on the Internet and my client complains that you have blocked his site and at the same time the whole IP of my server. <br><br>  On what basis did you block the whole IP and ‚Äúdo not consider it possible to unblock it‚Äù? <br>  Why do you think content is ‚Äúquestionable‚Äù?  And why did you decide that this is a valid reason for blocking? <br><br>  People create their "business cards", business sites, etc.  Because of your blocking honest users suffer losses. <br><br>  So far, I do not know that any of the created sites is really malicious. <br><br>  Plus, the service works completely officially and legally.  How to unlock IP? <br><br>  <i>ANSWER:</i> Your request has been analyzed.  This trigger is not false.  The site you specified is not recommended for visiting by Doctor Web, and the link to it will not be removed from Dr.Web virus databases. <br><br>  Hi, cap!  I already realized that analysts do not like my server.  But maybe answer at least one question from the ticket for the sake of decency? <br><br>  I call the secretary, I explain the situation: by phone, the support service does not solve the problem, through the ticket system they are also completely ignored.  I was asked to call the ticket number and wait ... and then write a second request to the support, maybe now things will move.  Obediently writing request # 3348697: <br><br>  <i>REQUEST:</i> Unfortunately, on the previous ticket # 3348329 you did not answer a single question. <br><br>  Please answer on what grounds the site is not recommended to visit, than he did not please your analysts? <br><br>  What should be done to allow the site to be visited?  - this is, of course, the most important question. <br><br>  Why do you forbid honest users to use honest sites? <br><br>  Why did you block the whole IP, although there are sites of different projects on it? <br><br>  <i>ANSWER:</i> Your request has been analyzed.  This trigger is not false.  The site you specified is not recommended for visiting by Doctor Web, and the link to it will not be removed from Dr.Web virus databases. <br><br>  Awesome.  Again I call the secretary and tell about the complete ignore by the technical support.  I get an explanation that if tech support cannot solve my question - you need to write a letter addressed to the general director.  Naturally, I immediately write and send it.  The content of the letter is about the same as in the requests. <br><br>  <b>Questions to the employees of my company are the same:</b> <br><br>  - what is the exact reason for blocking the whole IP? <br>  - What exactly is the content that disliked analysts and what exactly? <br>  - how to unlock IP, what do you need to do to do this? <br><br>  <b>What causes strong indignation in this whole story:</b> <br><br>  <i>- The whole IP address has been blacklisted.</i> <br><br>  Saw pimple - cut off the head.  Somehow it turns out.  I can assume that not all of my clients are ‚Äúwhite and fluffy.‚Äù  But even if among them there are outright fraudsters (which has not been proven) - why not point a finger at them and not punish them precisely?  Why should honest users suffer because of this? <br><br>  Surprisingly, why aren‚Äôt they blacklisted at the server, for example, the UCOZ service?  After all, with its help, many sites with ‚Äúdoubtful‚Äù and even obviously illegal content were made - for example, WAREZ sites.  There is discrimination. <br><br>  <i>- They did not give any objective substantiation of their decision.</i> <br><br>  ‚ÄúQuestionable content‚Äù - what exactly is that, where exactly?  What are the criteria for "doubtfulness"?  Solid subjectivity of some kind, as if the company has no clear internal rules for making such decisions. <br><br>  <i>- Complete ignoring of my questions by technical support.</i> <br><br>  I humanly can understand analysts and other employees whose work is not sugar.  There are mistakes and complex cases. <br><br>  But if 500+ sites have a problem because of the product of the company - can you at least give some answer to at least one polite question? <br><br>  <i>- Total bureaucracy.</i> <br><br>  I do not believe that there is no connection between the technical support department and the analytics department.  And I cannot believe that there are no middle managers in such a company who could help solve this problem more quickly.  In any case, my requests were ignored at all levels. <br><br>  As a result, I now sit and think, how can I still solve this issue constructively and, most importantly, promptly.  So far, as you can see, I decided to write this post and look at the reaction of the employees of the company Dr.  Web.  And I will be very grateful to everyone who will comment on this situation and give hints about getting out of this unpleasant situation. <br><br>  As you probably understand, a similar unpleasant story can happen to many commercial sites.  Especially with those where users create content. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/143153/">https://habr.com/ru/post/143153/</a></p>
