Now imagine the same, but for budget phones - without graphics and animation.  Yes, such games also exist, and are very popular in certain circles. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5b9/600/e87/5b9600e870bd0e8298c9c0345d08207d.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Among mobile games are a variety of genres.</i>  <i>But what's inside?</i> <br><br>  It is a bit strange that such projects can seriously interest someone.  I also thought so, until I plunged deeper into this industry.  So much so that he opened his own <a href="http://igru6ek.ru/">portal of mobile online games</a> with an audience of 30,000 visitors per month.  But this article is not to brag.  I want to introduce you to this amazing world closer, and that's why. <br><br><h2>  Hormones of happiness in its purest form </h2><br>  There is a theory that people play in order to get the next dose of endorphin.  You hit the unfortunate monster for the hundredth time and freeze in the intrigue: what treasure or equipment will fall out now.  Each such drop brings us a long-awaited piece of happiness, for which we return again and again.  More about this already written in an <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/88161/">article on Habr√©</a> .

      How does this relate to mobile browser games?  It's very simple - there is no atmospheric graphics, realistic animation and interactive pieces.  The only thing that comes into the game is to beat the monsters by endlessly pressing one or two buttons, get the coveted reward and pump up the characteristics of the hero. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/368/b28/a9d/368b28a9dfe27140205eb40ea9b6f28b.gif" alt="image"><br>  <i>Battle in the arena of the Battle of the Titans game</i> <br><br>  In essence, there is a struggle for the dynamics of numbers: level, strength, protection.  For everything else, you need to strain your imagination muscle and think it through.  Someone is on hand - in ordinary games, developers create the world, and in browser games the player can do it himself.  In some projects, of course, there are also beautiful drawings - equipment, locations.  But, firstly, only in some, and secondly - for users this is far from the main thing. <br><br>  So, if you want to find out where the hormones of happiness come from in games and how they work, browser-based mobile games are a great opportunity. <br><br><h2>  Demanding Interfaces </h2><br>  How character creation takes place in a regular online game: <br><ol><li>  Download and install the game, run </li><li>  Enter data: username, name, email, password </li><li>  We change already taken login, we confirm mail </li><li>  Putting the character: appearance, characteristics, race and clan </li><li>  We are waiting for the loading of the game world </li></ol><br><br>  How does the character creation in a mobile browser game: <br><ol><li>  Push the button "Start game" </li></ol><br>  That is, the person started the game by pressing one button.  This means that he has nothing to lose at all - he can also easily leave the project.  Therefore, the requirements for developers are much more stringent.  They have only a few seconds to let the player figure out how to get started and proceed to leveling. <br><br>  The only salvation - the most obvious interface.  We should not hope for the help section.  When the user performs several actions before the start of the game and loses time to prepare, he doesn‚Äôt need to enter the FAQ.  But, as we already know, to launch a browser-based mobile game you need to press just one button.  Further - either a fascinating fight, or farewell. <br><br>  I personally have been tasting games for more than 10 years and are watching something resembling a reverse evolution: the simpler the browser, the greater the likelihood that it will be played.  On the way, we met dozens of projects with a well thought-out battle system, a big game world.  On their study could lose more than one hour.  Conversely, there were games with which the acquaintance took a maximum of 10 minutes: he poked at the attack buttons, raised the level, bought equipment - and so on in a circle.  The first indicator of online players rarely reaches the top ten.  In the second he is a thousand times more. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3a3/1e7/b58/3a31e7b58e88b6b2624ad6fccc56acdb.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>On the left - the essence of the battle in two buttons, the average online - 3 000. On the right - you can move and select the attacked item, online - 100</i> <br><br>  So - if you want to pump up the skills of UX / UI design or are sure that you have achieved Zen in this - try to create a browser in which players will linger more than half an hour.  We'll have to sweat: I have already created 7 with different success, and basically it was insignificant. <br><br><h2>  High profitability </h2><br>  There is simple math.  The portal mentioned at the beginning participates in several affiliate programs.  On average, the site gives 1000-1500 registrations and receives a certain income.  Income is small - enough for "food and the road."  But one popular game per day gathers an audience more than the monthly attendance of the portal.  Now multiply all this by 5-10 projects, which are usually accompanied by one developer. <br><br>  Of course, it is a pity that companies are not in a hurry to share specific figures on income.  But let's turn to the portal again: there is a section with ads for buying and selling game accounts.  The usual situation is when a user sells an account for several thousand rubles, in which he himself has invested ten times more. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/554/a36/236/554a362364d635fc9b2c779754b27589.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Ads of users who trade game accounts</i> <br><br>  Do not rush to count, this is not all.  We take into account the relatively ridiculous resource requirements.  Iron and administration is incomparable with the same WOT or Dota 2. The maintenance of a browser game can be compared to the support of any average visited site.  And experts?  I collected projects alone, but ideally it should be a team of three people: a developer, designer and moderator who communicates with the players and keeps order.  What is not an idea for a startup? <br><br><h2>  What's this all about </h2><br>  And although the market for mobile browser games is really undervalued, this article is not propaganda.  It's a challenge.  Do you want to become a cool game-maker or do you think that you have no equal in this?  Try starting with a browser.  I spent an average week on it, it will probably take less time. <br><br>  And, continuing my ‚Äúnon-propaganda‚Äù, I will soon introduce you to several interviews with the developers of browser-based online games for the phone.  All cool projects and health! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/441710/">https://habr.com/ru/post/441710/</a></p>
