Everyone has a number of important reasons for this.  At the same time, in some companies a strong and friendly team is formed, while in others there is a serious change of personnel.  What is the difference between these companies, how to distinguish between them? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Design </h4><br>  In the already classical literature on the design of digital products there is such a thing as goal-oriented interaction design.  Its essence is that any user of a digital product has its own goals and solves certain tasks.  User satisfaction becomes the head of this approach. <br><br>  In this case, the user is a fairly broad concept.  It includes buyers, investors, managers, users, user guides, product designers, etc.

      I propose to look at a typical workflow through the prism of this approach and to determine approximate goals, the impossibility of which leads to thoughts about changing jobs. <br><br><h4>  Goals </h4><br>  There is an ordinary worker.  He only chooses his job or is already working.  What internal goals are driven by it and what influences it? <br><br>  I see several main goals: <br><ul><li>  Doing work is easy in a reasonable time; </li><li>  Receive sufficient remuneration; </li><li>  Be competent; </li><li>  To be successful; </li><li>  Feel its importance. </li></ul><br><br>  You can add a number of goals.  Each one will be different.  But common groups will be pretty clear.  All goals may be equivalent or have some priorities.  Let, in this case, all goals are equal.  That is, the inability to fulfill the goals of the employee is likely to force him to change his employer. <br><br><h4>  Assistants </h4><br>  Now consider the elements of the workflow that help an employee achieve goals.  We divide them into unconditional and conditional.  Unconditional - always help to achieve goals.  Conditional - help achieve goals when certain conditions are met. <br><br>  A typical worker process consists of the following steps: <br><ul><li>  Formulation of the problem; </li><li>  Understanding the task; </li><li>  Search for a solution; </li><li>  Implementation of the solution; </li><li>  Check the solution. </li></ul><br>  <b>1. The task clear to the performer is unconditional.</b> <br>  Competently and precisely composed task, which has a sufficient level of interpretation for an unambiguous interpretation of the solution, unconditionally realizes a number of goals of the employee. <br><br>  <b>The way of setting the task is conditional.</b>  Technical progress does not stand still.  Tasks can be set both in paper and in electronic form.  The method of setting can both bring the employee closer and away from his goals. <br><br>  <b>2. Enough time for understanding and understanding the task - unconditionally.</b>  Before performing a task qualitatively, the performer must clearly understand it. <br><br>  <b>The opportunity to receive consultations is conditional.</b>  Consultations of subject matter experts or more experienced colleagues will definitely bring the performer closer to the cherished goal.  If they are certainly ready to provide the necessary assistance at the proper level. <br><br>  <b>3. Availability of resources - of course.</b>  The availability of high-quality communication and communication facilities, a library is another plus to the goals of the employee. <br><br>  <b>The presence of a decision base is conditional.</b>  Very much depends on the quality of the decision base. <br><br>  <b>4. The ease of including the solution in the context of the task - unconditionally</b>  The easier it is to apply a solution to a problem, the better. <br><br>  <b>Ease of decision - conditionally.</b>  Light decisions do not always bring the performer closer to his goals. <br><br>  <b>5. Quantitative assessment of the success of the solution - of course.</b>  Quantitative assessments give the performer confidence. <br><br>  <b>The viability of the solution is conditional.</b>  Not all sustainable solutions are. <br><br>  Pretty abstract happened.  An example will be given below. <br><br><h4>  Effects </h4><br>  The daily impossibility of the achievement of goals by the performer affects his morale and morale.  This makes him think about changing his place of work, and maybe even his profile or profession. <br><br><h4>  From life </h4><br>  Take, for example, a developer, since this is the closest thing to me.  His assistants will be: <br><ul><li>  Unit Tests; </li><li>  <a href="http://govnokod.ru/">High quality code base;</a> </li><li>  New development; </li><li>  Continuous integration; </li><li>  Project nannies (a manager who helps him in everything. The truth is to know the measure); </li><li>  Quality tools; </li><li>  <a href="">Work in the stream;</a> </li><li>  Reasonable deadlines; </li><li>  Friendly team; </li><li>  Good compensation package; </li><li>  Accurate and unambiguous terms of reference; </li><li>  Availability of up-to-date documentation; </li><li>  Creation of modern systems; </li><li>  Difficult and interesting tasks; </li><li>  ... </li></ul><br>  And that is not all.  For good, it is necessary to conduct research.  The company that realizes the goals of the workers will be rewarded with high-quality work, a powerful personnel foundation, and, in general, success in the market. <br><br>  Who will formulate assistants for a manager, manager, administrator? <br><br><h4>  Dream offices </h4><br>  Everyone already knows how the office looks like <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/office/6668/">Google</a> , <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/office/95708/">Microsoft</a> , <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/office/9383/">Yandex</a> or <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/office/124347/">Vkontakte</a> .  In them, the goals of the performers receive some attention, but it seems to be insufficient.  In this case, the prestige of the company, which in itself realizes the user's goal to be successful, plays a role. <br><br>  They have a lot to learn, but it must be done with the mind.  Anyone can probably give an example of a small, poor, simple company, without any frills, in which the team is united, strong, purposeful.  Such groups continue to communicate outside its walls.  But it originated in the depths of the company, it was able to give its employees something that others could not give. <br><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4><br>  When creating a business, its goals are mainly taken into account.  But do not forget about those people who will move it higher and higher, will build a floor by floor.  It is necessary to realize the goals of the performers, otherwise the next Tower of Babel will be erected.  Well or Leaning ... <br><br>  If you apply this approach in the creation of a company and business principles, you can achieve good results.  Employees will be successful, motivated and loyal to the company.  Their goals are met, and business is guaranteed prosperity. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/285442/">https://habr.com/ru/post/285442/</a></p>
