  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The project of development of the educational program in the specialty "Information Security"</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I offer the readers of "Megamind" a story with elements of an appeal to participate in the development of an educational program in the specialty "Information Security". <br><br><h2>  About myself </h2><br>  I am a 37-year-old man, I have devoted almost all my professional life to practical information protection (‚Äúin the field‚Äù) and to administration / modernization of various small networks.  All my education is: a mathematical class at school, an institute, several advanced training courses on various topics of information security.  All the rest is self-education.  At the moment I am: <br><ul><li>  an engineer in an information security organization; </li><li>  the founder and director of a small non-profit organization, one of the directions of which is additional vocational education (with a license); </li><li>  Researcher at the Department of Information Security in a regional university. </li></ul><br>  At the last mentioned place of work, I was accepted with the main goal - to develop a new course on information security, taking into account new realities, regulatory requirements and the transition to new GEF generation ‚Äú3+‚Äù.  What further and will be discussed ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Situation </h2><br>  At the moment, the massive Russian higher professional education, in my opinion, is experiencing some difficulties. <br>  At the same time, when considering each individual university, faculty, department - the results are amazing: the high level of scientific work, the doctoral and candidate staff of teachers, the high demand for graduates "in the market." <br>  Much has already been written about a different vision of the same picture, for example, by students, and I see no need to repeat myself. <br>  If, however, it is necessary to monitor the websites of universities (regardless of status, location and ‚Äústeepness‚Äù) for the presence and quality of educational programs, curricula and annotations that are required for placement, then the picture looks like a catastrophe for the applicant and his parents. <br>  The topic is quite patient, and posts about the quality of higher education usually have a lot of comments. <br><br><h2>  The bad sides of Russian higher education and the problem statement </h2><br>  First, a few words about the problems mentioned: <br><ul><li>  teaching by teachers who have no real practice of applying knowledge and, as a result, the isolation of science and education from business (it is said that in the USSR it was possible to enroll in graduate school only after 3 years of practical work in the specialty, and the topics of scientific and research works invented by such teachers production requests). </li><li>  separation of business from science and education (business does not know how much life is simplified for it, income rises if you know the scientific and practical approaches (the Danning-Kruger effect): for example, knowledge of hyperbole, derivatives and series help to clearly determine the optimal price of the goods produced, knowledge Nash equilibria - to defend their interests in negotiations with the customer, the ability to determine the median - allows you to reduce production losses of any scale); </li><li>  lack of understanding by teachers of what to teach;  why teach this and not that;  why learn at all (after all, there is all the information on the Internet - you will need a terver - we will quickly learn (hours? days?) and apply); </li><li>  low ‚Äúaccuracy‚Äù of coordination and a large gap between disciplines ‚Äî from six months so that one discipline based on another discipline goes in order and does not accidentally change places, up to several years between mathematics and special discipline based on it; </li><li>  the lack of a meaningful connection between general disciplines (first of all, mathematics for technical specialties) and special ones, due to the difficulty of coordinating topics between departments and the maximum unification of courses for the maximum number of specialties taught at the university; </li><li>  lack of motivation to study (I came across the following students' motivation: ‚Äúretract from the army‚Äù, ‚Äúfind a husband‚Äù, ‚Äúwhat you have enough money for‚Äù); </li><li>  conditional "wealth" of the population (in the trolley bus, I heard high school students discuss the financial possibilities and the inability of their parents to pay for future education in universities in different specialties, while no one thinks that this is a serious initial capital for their business and 5 years lost - and as a result, neither knowledge nor business, for example, the resale of socks / sushi / pizza via home delivery / work over the Internet); </li><li>  lack of motivation from teachers to teach those who do not want to learn; </li><li>  lack of pedagogical knowledge of teachers of non-pedagogical universities (for some reason it is considered that the candidate of technical sciences automatically receives the necessary psychological and pedagogical skills with a crust); </li><li>  completely different education from two graduates of the same specialty, and specialization / profile of two different universities; </li><li>  low residual knowledge of the graduate; </li><li>  the disinterest of a university to teach a student well (the goal to gain more and pull up to graduation is that students are paid, the state ceases to pay for the expelled); </li><li>  the lack of understanding by all parties of the educational process of the competence approach (how to instill general professional competence, ‚Äúthe ability to use basic natural science laws, apply the mathematical apparatus in professional activities, identify the essence of problems arising in the course of professional activities‚Äù - what subject should be taught for a student to master it?); </li><li>  ignorance by all parties of the educational process of the legislation, their rights and obligations; </li><li>  the mythologization and praise of the humanitarian and non-humanitarian division of abilities and applicants' disabilities (‚ÄúI never understood mathematics, so I will go to lawyers‚Äù) and not taking into account the real abilities of a particular individual; </li><li>  accounting "hotelok" minor entrant when choosing a profession - specialty; </li><li>  discrediting of higher education in the eyes of the population: the absence of a noticeable difference in the results of the work of a person with and without higher education; </li><li>  extinction of the ULV system (commercial component - assessed contributions; conflicts of different scientific schools; secrecy of ULV materials for applicants, students and employers to verify their compliance with university programs; lack of authority in the regions, especially for universities that opened ‚Äúcommercially attractive‚Äù specialties, etc. P.). </li></ul><br>  Of course, I exaggerate and simplify some questions, but on the whole the problem should appear. <br>  However, the most difficult is: <br><ul><li>  realize and recognize that such problems exist in every university; </li><li>  want to solve these problems. </li></ul><br>  But, it should be noted that the initial ideas, such as transferring to universities the right to form programs for local employers, are quite correct in the existing conditions of lack of feedback (and management in general) from these employers, as education customers, to the Ministry of Education, distributing training quotas among universities and specialties and forming the Federal State Educational Standards (federal state educational standards).

    <h2>  Is it all bad? </h2><br>  I do not know of a single solution to this complex problem at the moment.  And it probably is not.  There are many reasons, from the limitations of the system of powers of state authorities to the banal illiteracy or unwillingness of individuals. <br>  But in fact there are so many people trying to solve the above problem.  New approaches are being developed, on thematic sites attempts are being made to collect requirements for graduates from employers, there are Yandex Schools, etc. <br>  The latest trend is online courses.  And increasingly, they are presented as a panacea for all the problems of our education.  Some school projects even try to translate online courses into courses.  At the same time, there is nothing new in this.  It is just that, in the conditions of new development opportunities for communication systems and computer equipment, the method of ‚ÄúProgram Training‚Äù, which was dusty there, was obtained from the storerooms.  The main thing when "selling" a new trend is not to carefully mention its shortcomings.  Of which even Wikipedia is written, not to mention serious pedagogical literature. <br>  And unfortunately, the main emphasis of the ‚Äúnew‚Äù education is placed on additional education.  Those who undertake the development of undergraduate and graduate programs (specialty programs in the current paradigm should have died a long time ago) are very few.  Too difficult and thankless job.  Therefore, such diamonds are more often known and accessible to a very narrow (relatively) circle of people.  Market mechanisms for selecting such a unique entity do not work (see ‚ÄúLemons‚Äù market or ‚Äúanalysis of markets with asymmetric information‚Äù by George Akerlof) <br>  And still our programming teams take the first places in the world, it is here that Perelman lives and all the discoveries in science are made by Russians! <br><br><h2>  Objective </h2><br>  Now about the objectives of the project. <br>  The general goal is to raise the level of education of workers with higher education. <br>  Project work objectives: <br><ul><li>  create a bachelor and master program in a separate specialty ("depth" to individual issues and the interrelation of various disciplines); </li><li>  to develop mechanisms for the collective creation of MPS programs; </li><li>  work out the approach and disseminate the results; </li><li>  create a feedback education, science and the real economy; </li><li>  to work out the processes of management, support and improvement (modernization) of the developed educational program at the department; </li><li>  It is possible to develop a software product that eliminates the routine and really takes into account the various bundles of competences with knowledge management (knowledge-skills-capabilities, listed in the GEF) and knowledge protection with specific labor functions. </li></ul><br><br><h2>  Terms and conditions </h2><br>  The decision should lie in the plane of typical capabilities of the head of the department level, correspond to (or at least not contradict) the existing education system, state requirements and (if possible) educational traditions. <br>  All specific restrictions, conditions, etc.  will be described in separate documents below. <br><br><h2>  What will i do </h2><br>  I will describe the entire course of work, in as much detail as possible, place the created documents, provide access to materials and developments. <br>  I will try to lay out raw materials so that I can see how I came to a decision or even a desktop record with an example of my actions when solving individual issues (if it is interesting to someone). <br><br><h2>  What I offer to the community </h2><br>  To observe what is being done in real time on a project, in real conditions, what problems and obstacles arise, suggest, help and criticize - the topic is too large to cover everything for one person. <br><br><h2>  PR and advertising </h2><br>  Unfortunately, in the case of detailed work without mentioning various software products, the names of individual organizations, etc.  I won‚Äôt be able to do, please don‚Äôt consider such cases as advertisements (for example, I draw the card's intelligence in FreeMind - because it‚Äôs fast in brainstorming and free). <br><br><h2>  New and opening </h2><br>  I do not discover anything new.  In work only already existing approaches, theories, techniques will be used.  The only thing I will try to use them in a complex and dialectical way. <br><br><h2>  Why do i need it </h2><br>  Say what you like, but without a good mass education, it is very difficult for a business to develop, it is difficult, long and often impossible to create a product-dream that will make mankind happy.  We really need literate people.  In addition, I see several paid branches from the work being done, but about them later. <br><br><h2>  Writing mode </h2><br>  I will try to unsubscribe at least once a week.  But failures are also possible.  I have my own business, a family, I myself study in one of the online courses, and in three jobs there are a lot of top priority tasks.  In such cases, I promise to place temporary landmarks of such distractions. <br><br><h2>  Call for help </h2><br>  I ask to assist the project with my experience and knowledge.  Each comment or criticism will be taken into account and if rejected, it is justified (with this, I will try to put such a comment into a separate document for consideration and possible further use or creation of an experience base for developing and implementing similar courses). <br><br><h2>  Attitude to copying ideas and copyright </h2><br>  I adhere to the principle that the idea costs nothing, its implementation is everything.  If any organization creates a product, even a commercial one, that solves the problems described, I‚Äôll happily give up the project and use the product on a general basis.  As for copyrights, their compliance, as well as compliance with the requirements of all other legislation, will be postulated in the future. <br><br><h2>  Right to fail </h2><br>  And of course I reserve the right to fail.  Life is quite a complicated thing and the implementation of the project can be hampered by a meteorite, a disease, dissatisfaction with the work of managers, an economic crisis, war, a change in life priorities, etc.  etc.  We will do what should and come what may. <br><br><h2>  Next post topics </h2><br>  I already have a small reserve of materials (mostly draft) and of course ideas and my own vision of the solution.  Looking ahead, I will say that I am going to lead the project on the PMBoK 5 version.  In the near future it is planned to talk about: <br><ul><li>  formalization of the problem; </li><li>  prototypes; </li><li>  first difficulties; </li><li>  working conditions; </li><li>  principles of work; </li><li>  principles in achieving results; </li><li>  project assumptions; </li><li>  state system of formation of Federal State Educational Standards and professional standards; </li><li>  approaches to concretization of labor functions (job responsibilities) and their compliance with specialization / profiles. </li></ul><br><br><h2>  Work example </h2><br>  In the next article I will lay out my approach to the formation of the master's and / or master's thesis on information security. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/285794/">https://habr.com/ru/post/285794/</a></p>
