      The system has Russian and English interfaces. <br><br>  The system can be used for personal monitoring and monitoring of small car parks. <br><br>  The system works perfectly on tablets and smartphones even with low resolution screens. <br><br>  The system supports various personal trackers, telematics devices, applications and protocols. <br><br>  The only limitation of the free version is the history is stored for <b>12 months</b> . <br><br><h4>  Useful features of the system </h4><br><ul><li>  Cartography: OpenStreetMap, Yandex Narodnaya, Yandex Sputnik, Yandex Cork, Google Sputnik, Google Roads, Bing Roads, MapQuest, OpenCycleMap. </li><li>  Geofences: a polygon (a convenient opportunity to quickly remove the last created point), a rectangle, a circle. </li><li>  You can simultaneously monitor multiple devices. </li><li>  The composition of information fields, which are displayed in a pop-up window (when clicking on the tracker icon), can be configured. </li><li>  It is possible to quickly (through the tracker icon) go to its information panel. </li><li>  Within your account, you can create additional users who can monitor and generate reports, but cannot change information and device settings. </li><li>  For any selected tracker, you can create observers (they can only monitor the device).  Access for observers can be limited in time.  It can be terminated at any time. </li><li>  For the devices in your account, you can set the parameters by which notifications are generated (low charge, overspeed, delay with contact). </li><li>  It is possible to send commands to the devices via GPRS. </li><li>  Quickly (from the application window) reference information and the ability to contact technical support is available. </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/301/f87/e06/301f87e06470408ca1116f42d043bb46.jpg"><br><br>  The system has an advanced reporting system.  Reports can be received in the form of graphs and charts.  Reports can be created directly in the application window, or in external files.  In preferences, the user sets the format of reports generated in external files.  Currently available formats: HTML, RTF, PDF, OpenDocument Text Document, OpenDocument Spreadsheet, MS Excel, MS Word 2007, MS Excel 2007, MS PowerPoint 2007, CSV. <br><br><h2>  Appendix "ViaLatM Lighthouse and Tracker" </h2><br>  Simple and convenient android application for GPS monitoring.  Well integrated with ViaLatM service.  With it, you can let your relatives and friends know where you are now, keep your family, friends and colleagues informed about your arrival time at scheduled meetings.  Allows you to save and analyze the history of walks and travel. <br><br>  <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.euler2012.vialatm">App page on Google Play</a> <br><br>  <a href="http://www.euler2012.com/vbt/tracker_ru.html">Application section on the website www.euler2012.com</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/12e/bcf/e1f/12ebcfe1f22b46d183b5c969b0aad111.jpg"><br><br><h3>  Integration with service ViaLatM </h3><br><ul><li>  The entire set of mapping providers supported by the ViaLatM service. </li><li>  Ability to monitor multiple devices included in your account. </li><li>  Work with geofences and setting up event notifications. </li><li>  A complete set of reports provided by the ViaLatM service. </li></ul><br><h3>  Main features </h3><br><ul><li>  It works in two modes: <b>"Beacon"</b> - periodic fixation of the current location and <b>"Tracker"</b> - the formation of the route of movement.  In addition, in both modes, one-time registration of the current location is allowed. </li><li>  The application does not require registration.  Just install it on your smartphone. </li><li>  To transfer your location to observers, a special link is generated on the website www.euler2012.com (no registration is required to access this link). </li><li>  The link can be sent to someone via SMS, email or using any other service installed on the smartphone. </li><li>  The link expires at the time of its creation and can be changed or terminated at any time. </li><li>  The possibility of convenient selection of modes of operation.  For Beacon, an interval is set at which the current location is recorded; for Tracker, the quality of the formed track is set.  In this case, in all cases, it is possible to independently fine-tune the modes of operation. </li><li>  The ‚ÄúBeacon‚Äù mode can be started even when the localization on the smartphone is completely disabled.  In this case, the location will be determined by cellular towers. </li></ul><br><h3>  Additional features </h3><br><ul><li>  Saving battery (setting the interval of the GPS receiver). </li><li>  Saving mobile Internet traffic in tracker mode: setting the interval for sending coordinates to a server;  setting the data transfer mode only via Wifi;  Packing data packets when transferring them to the server. </li><li>  Setting additional attributes of messages that are transmitted to the server. </li><li>  Set the flag of the "Tracker" mode when receiving a low battery signal. </li><li>  Set actions when restarting the smartphone. </li><li>  Setting the flag to prohibit the use of mobile Internet in roaming. </li><li>  The ability to fine-tune the ‚ÄúBeacon‚Äù and ‚ÄúTracker‚Äù modes - setting time and distance for updating coordinates, accuracy of positioning. </li><li>  Display on the information screen the number of not sent points, the data on the last track and the last registration of the location. </li></ul><br><h3>  Use cases </h3><br>  In order for close people to know where you are now, simply launch ‚ÄúBeacon‚Äù, create a link and send it to the recipients.  By default, the location fixing mode is set every 15 minutes (this allows economical use of the battery life of the smartphone).  By accessing the link, your loved ones will know your current location. <br><br>  If you want to let your family or friends know about your arrival time at a meeting, uncheck the ‚ÄúUse WiFi only‚Äù option in the tracker settings (wifi is usually not available on the way), create a link and send it to the recipients.  Run the "Tracker".  Information about your movement will be transmitted to the server every 5 minutes and available to the recipients - they will know if you are delayed, or arrive on time. <br><br>  If you want to save the history of your walk or trip, select the "Use WiFi only" checkbox in the tracker settings (to save mobile Internet traffic).  Run the "Tracker".  After the walk, stop the tracker.  Information about your track will be transmitted and available when a WiFi connection is established on the smartphone. <br><br><h2>  Conclusion </h2><br>  The main tasks in the development of services and applications were - simplicity and ease of use.  Service and applications for it will be actively developed and improved, but these tasks will always be the most important. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/249509/">https://habr.com/ru/post/249509/</a></p>
