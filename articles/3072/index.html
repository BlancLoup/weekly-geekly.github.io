I also wanted to be the best go player in the world.  I wanted the partnership between IBM and Microsoft to remain to the general advantage, but even here it did not work out.  There are people I wanted to hire, but could not.  In general, I have had enough disappointments in my life. </blockquote><br><br><blockquote>  Sometimes I envy those who program.
