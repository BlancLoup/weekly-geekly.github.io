It was time for graduation, tulips and lilies of the valley bloomed, and another volcano with a difficult to pronounce name woke up in Iceland ... <br><br>  It was a successful month for <a href="http://workle.ru/">Workle</a> - we (finally) started the open testing of the project, visited a number of universities, spoke at the conference “RIF + CIB 2011” and did a lot of other things.  In general, there is something to tell :) <br><br><img src="http://hostingkartinok.com/image/01201106/4fc148b71d3625f6ffaba20a21e286cf.jpg" alt="image">

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  The idea to the masses! </h4><br>  It all started with “RIF + CIB 2011”, where we got through “Program 2.0” (sections selected by conference participants according to the voting results).  Our mentor, Anton Nosik, spoke in the section “How to build a“ dream company ”” with the report “The dream team - the crowd”, most of which was dedicated to Workle. <br><br><blockquote>  <i>If more, then the report dealt with the concept of “user corporation”, which allows any Internet user to learn and build a career right on the net with all the advantages of classic office work.</i> </blockquote><br><img src="http://hostingkartinok.com/image/01201106/385217c2bc89e8267ba795fe09b0cbe3.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In fact, it was Workle's first official announcement, and we were terribly worried.  But the freshness of the idea (especially against the background of discussions of corporate cultures) and the speaker's charisma did their job - we were covered with a barrage of questions, the answers to which we were engaged in all the remaining time.  In general, everything went very well. <br><br>  But we didn’t want to stop at what we have achieved, and we went further <br><br><br><h4>  The publication </h4><br><img src="http://hostingkartinok.com/image/01201106/848ce347e78e1409befd7ed525d8fbe7.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The next step was visiting the universities.  It is no secret that many students (starting a course like this from the 3rd) have a problem of combining work with study.  And, given the size of scholarships, the problem is serious.  But we believe that Workle can easily solve it, and therefore held a series of lectures in several Moscow universities, where they talked about online work, distributed invites for the project and simply shared their life experiences with hundreds of curious minds. <br><br>  In addition, we attended meetings of several large public organizations, where we raised issues of unemployment and combating it with the help of Workle. <br><br>  In both cases we received a lot of positive comments, thanks and even a number of practical ideas that we are now implementing in the project.  So, such “appearances” will surely be repeated again, and again, and again ... <br><br><br><h4>  World, #Workle, May! </h4><br>  Also, in honor of Labor Day, we organized an action “Peace!  #Workle!  May! ”, The report of which is already <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/workle/blog/119525/">posted</a> on Habré.  There were a lot of prizes, lots of fun, a couple of cool beatboxers and even a live boa (no one knew where he came from).  In total, about 500 people took part in the festive event.  Below is a detailed report from the scene (previously unpublished): <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/00pi9uQQDmI&amp;xid=17259,15700002,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhgLHNHCgr_aSmuDchWiB_J4TPkmww" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><br><h4>  PRUFFI Rating </h4><br><br><img src="http://pruffi.ru/images/logo_30startups.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The result of the month (and a pleasant surprise) was the hit of Workle in the <a href="http://pruffi.ru/30startups/">rating of the most promising start-up startup teams of Runet in 2011</a> according to <b>PRUFFI</b> agency.  In fact, we were added to this list just 5 days before the announcement of its results (thanks, Habr), and it was a pleasant surprise: 22 position out of 130 participants is not bad for a young startup :) <br><br><br><h4>  Workle today </h4><br>  So, what is Workle today: <br><ul><li>  we have entered into partnership contracts with many leading Russian companies, including: <b>Renaissance Insurance</b> , <b>OTP Bank</b> , <b>ROSNO</b> , <b>Vostochny Express</b> <b>Bank</b> , etc. More than 20 companies are at the stage of signing contracts; </li><li>  2000 users were registered on the project (temporary limit), and more than 3000 applications for registration were submitted; </li><li>  Online work is available in the “Finance” and “Insurance” professions, and soon “Fitness”, “Real Estate” and “Tourism” will be added. </li></ul>  In general, the project is developing at the speed of our and your thoughts :). <br><br>  Thanks to everyone who helps to make Workle better! <br><br>  <b>PS</b> Now Workle has a <a href="http://iworkle.ru/">corporate blog</a> , as well as official pages on <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Workle/166584223366523">Facebook</a> , <a href="http://twitter.com/">Twitter</a> , <a href="http://vkontakte.ru/workle_ru">VKontakte</a> and <a href="http://workle.livejournal.com/">LiveJournal</a> (forgive us for writing incorrectly). <br><br>  <b>UPD:</b> 500 invites have <a href="http://invite.workle.ru/">been</a> added to <a href="http://invite.workle.ru/">invite.workle.ru</a> , and the project user limit has been increased to 2500. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/120818/">https://habr.com/ru/post/120818/</a></p>
