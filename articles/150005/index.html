    <img src="http://wezel.ru/book/images/1mini.png" alt="image"><br><br>  I watched the inhospitable grandfather with the leaflet.  Many around too have similar.  Every second one looks at these leaflets of different sizes.  Someone, looking like a madman, was talking to his little piece of paper.  And one girl even drove a finger over the blank sheet.  She seemed to be drawing something.  Most of the surrounding people were walking along the avenue, and she was sitting on a new wooden bench.  It was necessary to immediately choose to talk her, and not a sharp grandfather with signs of senile marasmus.  I rehearsed the question several times and then walked over to her and sat down beside her. <br>  - Hello, - in the Moscow manner, singing vowels, <br>  I said. <br><br>  ‚ÄúHello,‚Äù the girl snapped off, glancing at me briefly, and continued her work. <br><br>  She drove her index finger on a clean cardboard sheet of approximately A4 size.  It‚Äôs stupid to look at a blank piece of paper and poke your fingers in there.  Maybe there is a clinic for the mentally ill nearby? <br><br>  - Excuse me, what's your name?  - I began from afar. <br><br>  - Nastya.  What did you want?  - Looking straight into the eyes, she asked. <br><br>  - I came here to visit, I wanted to ask how to get to Red Square. <br><br>  - Pass the?  She is very far from here.  Go on foot, if you want to earn a fortune of Coin, but it seems to me that you will quickly get calluses.  If you are going to get there, better take a flip.  In general, I now have no time, I now pass the exam in stereoscopy.  On, take the sheet, then you can easily find your area on the map and call the flip, ‚ÄùNastya quickly rattled, giving her paper to me and taking a new one out of the bag. <br><br>  - Thank you, Nastya.  You helped me a lot!  - I said to the young girl, nodding my head, and going to the side, looking at a pristine sheet.  The paper was a little thicker than a regular sheet on which we write in the office.  In the upper right corner there was a small, round, white, white pea with a black dot in the middle.  The reverse side was no different. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe Country of the Insane‚Äù, I thought, and, having traveled a considerable distance, I occupied an empty shop.  Why did this girl give me an empty piece of paper?  Could take a pen and draw a map.  Why are they all so inhospitable?  And what kind of Moscow is this, in which it smells of the sea?  Maybe I'm in the USA, Idaho?  Moscow is also there.  But why then do people speak with real Moscow dialect and in Russian? <br><br><img src="http://4tree.ru/data/1310/clipboard_945.png" alt="image"><br><br>  In the meantime, I turned the paper in my hands, having already guessed that it could be turned on.  I had an e-book at home and, most likely, it was her thin analog.  I clicked on a pea in the corner of the sheet, but nothing happened.  I folded the sheet in half and even in four.  He dutifully bent, but then he straightened out unusually, leaving no folds.  Some kind of unusual "high-tech" paper.  I even tried to jostle her, crushing her with all my might, but there was no sound.  People passing by looked strange, surprised at my movements.  It was interesting to fold the sheet in half - at this time an unusual clicking sound came from the paper. <br><br>  In order to hear him better, I brought the paper to my ear and, not having time to spread out the paper, drowned in thousands of chills.  The feeling was similar to the fact that I seemed to have served not only my leg, but the whole body.  Feeling so much goosebumps in half a second was unexpected.  The sheet near the ear gently whistled by ultrasound, like a turning on TV.  It took me a couple of seconds to recover and look at the paper. <br><br><img src="http://wezel.ru/book/images/kovcheg.png" alt="image"><br><br>  An image of a futuristic building in a fog surrounded by trees was displayed on a just blank white sheet.  The fog moved, and the foliage of the trees moved in the wind, making it clear that the picture was not static.  There was a glowing sign on the building with the inscription ‚ÄúARK‚Äù.  It was awfully unusual to see on paper a picture with such high resolution and smooth animation.  I looked spellbound.  It was very unusual, because the logs always show the points that make up the image.  And here everything was like a video, but not as on a TV screen, but as in a high-quality photo.  The image occupied the whole sheet, without leaving even fields. <br><br>  When I tried to take the sheet more comfortably, the picture came to life: the fog intensified and in a couple of seconds completely hid the building and the trees.  The leaf turned white again.  I was overwhelmed with emotions.  I think I would feel the same if the pictures on the milk carton suddenly stirred and ran around the bag.  Still, people fall into a stupor when faced with the unusual properties of ordinary things.  It's good that I am not very impressionable and did not run away, throwing a piece of paper under the bench. <br><br>  Meanwhile, an inscription appeared on the screen: ‚ÄúVladimir, welcome to the Ark.  Register you as a new user? ‚Äù.  Wow!  This leaflet knows my name!  Miracles.  It became really interesting where it turned out that the sheets could guess the name.  Do not leave the feeling that this is someone's evil joke.  I looked around.  No one was watching me, everyone around me was in a hurry about their business - some on foot and some on a bicycle.  The sun was shining brightly, but due to the high humidity of the sweltering heat was not felt. <br><br>  I rubbed my forehead with my hand and then pointed my finger at the ‚ÄúRegister‚Äù button.  Smoothly appeared user agreement.  I tried to read, but there was so much text, and it was written in such an incomprehensible legal language that I quickly abandoned this idea.  He flicked his finger to the bottom and clicked the "Agree" button there. <br><br>  A virtual keyboard emerged from below, and exactly in the middle a search string appeared in which the cursor blinked.  The keyboard layout was familiar, but its appearance surprised very much.  The keys were squeezed out on a piece of paper, and I didn‚Äôt have time to notice how it happened.  I unfolded the sheet the other side and made sure that there the paper is also deformed.  I lightly touched the bulging buttons, which bulged up a whole millimeter and, unlike the white sheet, were black with silver letters.  Even on buttons "A" and "O" there were two convex strokes that are so familiar to people who own the blind method of printing. <br><br>  Another oddity was waiting for me when I tried to check the sheet for flexibility.  After switching it on, it became hard as a thin layer of aluminum, remaining still light.  Only four corners remained soft and easily bent, protecting the wearer from damage.  I tried typing on the virtual keyboard and realized that it was very convenient, and it was not so virtual.  The keys even slightly "clicked" when pressed. <br><br><img src="http://4tree.ru/data/1310/clipboard_397.png" alt="image"><br><br>  I typed "Red Square" on the keyboard and pressed "Enter".  The keyboard immediately went down, and the animation was not only graphic: the key relief also followed, absolutely synchronously and very quickly.  The screen was replaced by a video clip on half the screen.  Showed the usual Red Square, on which people walked.  Tourists with cameras.  Military guard at the same place at the mausoleum.  Even the chimes beat with a sound familiar to anyone who has ever celebrated the New Year in Russia.  The text below described the history of the emergence of Red Square and gave various other information.  I was very surprised by something else.  From school I knew that the square was built in the XV century.  And here, in the text, my eye caught on the fact that the area last year was already 2,000 years old.  My brain refused to consider the difference between the fifteenth century and two thousand.  It turned out a lot more than it should have been.  The subconscious had already guessed what was the matter, and tried to overshadow my brain, but he was too busy with anxiety surging. <br><br>  I half went back to bed next to Julia half a day.  We put our three-year baby next, and I calmly fell asleep.  I woke up in an incomprehensible place.  I thought it was a bad joke.  But now there are so many little things and they have been so carefully developed that it becomes like a bad dream.  I pinched myself and with a fresh look began to look around - it all came together.  I am in the future. <br><br>  - Volodya!  Volodya!  Shouted a stranger elderly man running toward me. <br><br>  I automatically turned in his direction and began to dream that the stranger would run longer, so that it would be possible to finish the realization that I had apparently jumped over one and a half thousand years over that night.  I had to decide what to do with it now and how to live with it.  But I did not have time. <br><br>  ‚ÄúVova, I've been looking for you for an hour,‚Äù the man shouted happily, ‚Äúwhere have you gone?‚Äù <br><br>  - Sorry, do we know each other?  - I asked, getting up from the bench and making a surprised look. <br><br>  - ABOUT!  Yes!  I forgot to introduce myself.  I am the person who can explain everything to you.  For example, how did you get here and why, - the man spoke quickly and in a businesslike manner in the years, wiping sweat from his gray temples and forehead with a handkerchief. <br>  ‚ÄúIt would be great,‚Äù I said with relief, carefully examining his face.  Strange, but his appearance was familiar to me.  I tried hard, but could not remember where I could see him.  This is often the case with me, considering what a kaleidoscope of people passes through me in a car dealership.  Remembering that you saw a person in general is much easier than remembering where you saw it and under what circumstances. <br><br>  - How did you get out of the apartment?  I seem to have blocked the elevator.  Siganul through the window from the third floor?  - smiling, asked the old man.  - After all, I went out just for three hours - check how things are going at work. <br><br>  - So this is your apartment?  - I asked.  - Pretty pretty, I must say.  I just went down the second elevator, which is for the car. <br><br>  - BUT!  Clear.  I, the muddler, forgot to block the second lift.  I haven't ridden my E-shke for a long time.  More and more on public flips move. <br><br>  - Flipah?  Is it a taxi?  - I asked. <br><br>  - Hmm.  Well, it seems like that.  At your time they were called taxis.  And we have it just public cars. <br><br>  - What's your job?  - I asked in the hope that they would answer me. <br><br>  - Cart dealership, - the interlocutor answered with ease. <br><br>  ‚ÄúI also work at a car dealership,‚Äù I said, feeling my own soul and relaxing a little.  - A patron - what is this post? <br><br>  - Like what?  Main.  Commanding.  Boss. <br><br>  - Director, or what? <br><br>  ‚ÄúWell, yes, by the meaning,‚Äù the grandfather nodded.  - Terminology changes over time. <br><br>  - Maybe we will go to the main thing?  Where am I and what am I doing here?  What is the century and why did I suddenly find myself in your apartment?  ‚ÄúOf course Volodya,‚Äù the old man nodded.  - I'll explain everything to you, just let's go back home.  I am terribly hungry, and if I do not eat for fifteen minutes, I will have insulin shock. <br><br>  ‚ÄúGood,‚Äù I said, and went to the direction from which I came, simultaneously folding the ‚Äúmultimedia sheet‚Äù and removing it in my breast pocket.  The sheet is surprisingly easy to form in three steps into a compact bar the size of a thin smartphone. <br><br>  The old man overtook me and, showing a hand the way, led me to the transition down. <br><br>  We quickly reached the central entrance to the building, on the third floor of which I woke up a few hours ago.  No one was in the front door, only the elevator stood open and played music, inviting to enter.  We both went in and did not press anything, the elevator itself made a decision and quickly went up to the third floor.  We found ourselves in a familiar corridor with that fluffy white carpet, which I was so afraid to mess with my moccasins.  The old man first went to the apartment, took off his shoes and deftly, on the move, without stopping, stuck his legs in old leather slippers and shuffled towards the kitchen, never looking back.  Without losing a second, I took two cups from the top cabinet, put them on the kitchen countertop, and several times moved my finger over the leaflet that was attached to the refrigerator. <br><br>  A moment later, something within the wall began to hiss, small taps appeared above the circles, from which steam was coming.  The whole apartment is very tasty smell of coffee.  Only then did the old man turn to me and look straight into my eyes.  His face seemed familiar again. <br><br>  - What is your name?  - I decided to ask. <br><br>  <i>(piece cut out)</i> <br><br><h1>  Coines </h1><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/689/e2b/eb0/689e2beb00af25ca38fd0ef2ab6dc8fa.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The knife in the right hand cut the meat easily as butter.  In the place of the cut rose pink juice.  Many people call such a degree of roasting ‚Äúmeat with blood‚Äù, but in fact it is not blood, but a delicious meat juice.  Losing it in the heat treatment process is a real crime.  That is why the people of the future invented a way to hold it during frying.  Vsevolod Vladimirovich was right: there was not even a hint of chemistry in the amazing taste of marbled beef.  Crisp gave the impression that the meat was removed from the pan a second ago.  The smell was unusually bright and fascinating. <br><br>  I ate this delicacy and eagerly watched how quickly it melts in my mouth.  But after I felt very well fed, my interest in meat and food in general began to disappear.  It is in this well-fed state that I like to go grocery shopping to the supermarket.  When I go to the store to go hungry after work, how imperceptibly my bags are filled with unnecessary and tasty sweets and convenience foods.  Once I was so forgotten that I did not have enough money and had to lay out a few expensive products at the cash desk, embarrassed by the reproachful looks of a long line. <br><br>  ‚ÄúYou wanted to tell you about the Coin,‚Äù I said, finishing the last piece. <br><br>  ‚ÄúOf course,‚Äù said Vsevolod Vladimirovich, finishing his tomato juice, ‚Äúnow we‚Äôll just order tea, coffee or hot chocolate.‚Äù  What are you going?  I recommend coffee with ice cream. <br><br>  - Putting on your taste. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThen choose him in your list,‚Äù said Vsevolod Vladimirovich, helping me to manipulate the device.  - Click here and then here.  Click "Make an order". <br><br>  I chose a beautiful photo of a large glass on a short leg, in which a pretty ball of ice cream, sprinkled with nuts, lay on top of coffee.  Clicked on the convex button "Make an order".  A window with a red frame and an exclamation mark appeared on the screen.  The inscription read: "Not enough money."  I was upset and looked at Vsevolod Vladimirovich with a blank look. <br><br>  ‚ÄúOops,‚Äù the old man smiled.  - You Coin ran out. <br><br>  - And what to do?  - I asked. <br><br>  - I promised to treat you.  Come here your sheet, I perekinu <br>  you three hundred Coin in debt. <br><br>  He put his sheet to mine, and after several short manipulations, three coins appeared on his screen, which he moved with his finger to my sheet.  In the upper right corner, next to the clock, the number 320 appeared. Then I again pressed the ‚ÄúPlace Order‚Äù button.  This time succeeded.  After 5 minutes, a beautiful waitress brought on the tray two identical glasses of coffee with ice cream. <br><br>  - Why in debt?  - I smiled.  - You said, treat. <br><br>  ‚ÄúListen, the fact that you are running out of money will help to explain our payment system and the general economy.  It will seem confusing to you, but over time you will realize that everything is very logical and simple. <br><br>  ‚ÄúI listen attentively,‚Äù I said, sipping hot, thickish coffee with melted ice cream through a straw. <br><br>  - I have already said that our Coin cannot be lost, stolen and donated.  The social network ensures that everyone earns this money himself.  Therefore, I can not give you the food that you eat.  I can give you a loan.  But the amount of debt can not exceed 2000 Coin. <br><br>  - Why is my number on the screen red? <br><br>  - Because I gave you a loan.  When you start earning it yourself, the debt will be written off automatically.  Nowadays, making money is pretty easy.  True, spend too.  If you lead a correct life and work in my cabin, then you will have enough for a fairly comfortable existence. <br><br>  - Do you have cash? <br><br>  - Of course not.  It would be rather stupid to carry cash with you if absolutely everywhere you can spend coins.  Moreover, their accounting and write-off occur automatically.  This makes a social network.  Due to the fact that the social network does not belong to anyone and does not know how to issue, that is, the banal printing of empty money, we do not have inflation.  This ensures the stability of the economy. <br><br>  ‚ÄúIf they don‚Äôt print money, then that‚Äôs good,‚Äù I nodded. <br><br>  - The last crisis, we just had to do with debts.  We are very hard for him.  Entire countries were ravaged. <br><br>  - In order to avoid the accumulation of such debts, the network ensures that you cannot get a large amount of debt.  If you want money - be kind, earn.  No man on earth has a debt greater than 2000. Everyone can spend only what they can work out. <br><br>  - How do you earn Coin?  - I asked with interest. <br><br>  - Here let's do an experiment.  Please go to that pool, and then go right back.  While you go, look at your account. <br><br>  I got up from my seat and went on foot.  The number of coins on the account began to increase - a kind of pedometer.  When I came back, the amount increased by 7 coins. <br><br><img src="http://4tree.ru/data/1310/clipboard_919.png" alt="image"><br><br>  ‚ÄúI think you understood the easiest way of earning money,‚Äù said Vsevolod Vladimirovich, squishing a straw in a glass with almost finished coffee, ‚Äúany physical work that is good for health is rewarded with coin.  And if in your time, people had to force themselves to go to the pool, run in the mornings and go in for sports and invent their own motivation, now everything is easier.  Without a healthy lifestyle, you will be a beggar. <br><br>  - You want to say that on the street so many people who walk for fun, get paid for it?  - I asked in surprise.  - And while no one smokes and does not drink? <br><br>  ‚ÄúWe have won smoking and drunkenness long ago,‚Äù said the old man, ‚Äúwe do not sell cigarettes, and with alcohol abuse you will not even notice how you will nullify your account.‚Äù  The most interesting thing is that a small amount of good wine or brandy is even encouraged, as it allows to improve health.  And people who walk, run and swim in the pool, really earn Coins in large quantities. <br><br>  - And who exactly is paying you for doing physical activity? <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Apparently, the social network works for our benefit. She does everything so that we do not get sick and maintain a high immunity. No one knows why she needs it, but it is. She rewards everything that brings us health. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- And what will happen if I do not engage in physical activity and reset my account?</font></font> - I asked. <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- People with a zero score, - Vsevolod Vladimirovich made the most serious expression on his face, so I haven‚Äôt seen him yet, - they continue to live as before, but they can not buy anything. If you are in such a state, you try to take someone else's, for example, if you are treated to your food or shelter for the night, then the double price is deducted from your account. And God forbid you to accumulate more than 2000 debts. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- And then what? - I asked with great interest. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- From a social network in this case you will not hide anywhere. She appoints the worst punishment for a person. And you better not try it. The one who survived him and did not lose his mind thinks that he was lucky and has since grind him as if he was damned. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- And what kind of punishment?</font></font> Shooting?<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Jail? Eviction out of town? </font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/30c/c0f/5d7/30cc0f5d71d9032753f119e150d6f049.png" alt="image"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- You know, the social network has come up with a very powerful motivator, and it is more terrible than shooting. The person is designed so that instinctively drawn to other people. Next to others, being in ‚Äúhis pride‚Äù, he feels more confident. Therefore, the overwhelming number of people who have ever lived and live on planet Earth become weak and vulnerable from a long stay in solitude. It was loneliness that became the only, but sufficient punishment for the debts of more than 2000 </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">koin. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúAnd sometimes I like to be alone,‚Äù I said, blankly.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- You just did not try, like many others, what real loneliness is. From childhood, from birth, we live in a certain family, community. We communicate with our parents, brothers, sisters, aunts and uncles, grandparents, and neighboring children of the same age. We also go to nursery, kindergarten, school as a child, which smoothly flows with age to the university and work. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Let's skip this topic. It hurts me so much that I do not know when I will see Julia and her son.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- You see, - the old man raised his index finger, - you just all day, as you find yourself without your relatives, and already not your own. And now try to imagine how the Ark social network punishes for debts. You are absolutely alone in a small room with soft monotonous walls. It is well ventilated, warm and comfortable there. Monotonous food is always in one place, and it is in abundance. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- You have a strange idea of ‚Äã‚Äãpunishment.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Listen further. You are in absolute silence in this small cell. Nobody visits you. There is no TV. Radio is not. Newspapers and books are missing. In the afternoon, the bed is removed, and you can only stand. The only place where you can sit down is a cold iron toilet. On the floor in one place of the camera is a simple treadmill with a small display on which your score is displayed. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúYou are describing some kind of science fiction,‚Äù I smiled.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúIf only,‚Äù the old man nodded and continued. - In order to earn those 7 coins on this treadmill, which you earned by going to the pool and back, you will have to run monotonously, looking at the monotonous wall before your eyes, all day. And the worst thing is that for staying in this solitary cell, 3 coins are written off. And for visiting the shower, which is located directly in the chamber, 1 coin is charged. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúTherefore, in order to repay the debt of 300 koin, you will literally have to run along this‚Äú conveyor belt ‚Äùlike a squirrel in a wheel for about 6 months. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Yeah. Your network is very cruel.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Volodya, I do not even know what to say to this. Given the many ways to earn money, I would not agree with you. Very few people of the XXXV century go to jail. And, especially, very few of those who decide on a relapse. You just watch your score, manage to earn and spend less. It is much easier than it seems. Most people do not even think about money, because the sheet warns of the danger of becoming a beggar in advance. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Is the sheet left in prison? </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Of course not. I said that there are no books or newspapers.</font></font> BUT!<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I forgot that you are from the 21st century. We have books and newspapers published only for the sheet. There are no other ways to read. When you learn all the functions of this useful device, you yourself will understand all its advantages over paper. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- And where did these sheets come from? - I asked, trying to change the topic to a more pleasant one. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Nobody really knows. Rumors go more than a hundred, and not find out which of them is true. Just know that there are a lot of these sheets around and it‚Äôs impossible to lose them. We have here large sheets, small ones, and even whole notebooks and albums. Sheets are always free and widely distributed. We do not think about finding them the same way as in your time you did not think about pens and pencils.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- I have already noticed that when I take someone else‚Äôs leaf in his hands, he becomes mine and displays what I did before. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- In this and convenience. You probably have not tried working with different sizes yet. Sometimes it is convenient to place two or three sheets in front of you, and the fourth to put in front of you as a keyboard and trackpad. Sheets themselves are able to adapt to your needs. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- How do you read books? </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Well, the most convenient way is to take a notebook and look through. It‚Äôs not so convenient to carry around with you and it‚Äôs not so convenient to talk on the telephone with it, but those who read a lot prefer just such a form factor. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- By the way about the phone. Did you talk about some kind of "pukozhuchkov"?</font></font> - I asked. <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- BUT! I have already forgotten, - the old man laughed, - these are not ‚Äúpuzozhuchki‚Äù, these are picozhuchki. ‚ÄúPico‚Äù is about their size. They have almost everyone. These are special and very small devices that need to be thrown into the ear. They are like nanorobots, move to the eardrum, and stick to the wall of the ear with picas-suckers. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Robots in the ears? - I was surprised. - And why are they needed? </font></font><br><br><img src="http://4tree.ru/data/1310/clipboard_969.png" alt="image"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúThey are very small,‚Äù the patient old man explained, ‚Äúthey have a long, thinnest sting, which they pierce the nearest blood vessel and, due to it, feed in such a way that they work forever. The man does not feel this at all. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúWow mosquitoes,‚Äù I said, scratching my ear from the inside. - And you voluntarily throw them there and not afraid to lose your hearing? </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- You listen further. Just one of their functions is hearing loss.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Sorry, are you crazy? Why do you dream of hearing loss? </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- I will continue, - Vsevolod Vladimirovich smiled. - If you turn on a special option on the sheet, and it is turned on with one gesture, then the sound of the surrounding world calms down. And you can adjust the ambient sound by volume. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Ahem. How does it work? </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- I'm telling. In the ear is located about five or six bugs. Some of them work as microphones, while others swing your membrane with special mustaches. In this way, they can give you a sense of sound. Liszt communicates with them and can receive sound from them and transmit music or speech to them. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- And you do not feel them in the ear? - I was surprised. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Well, for example, do you feel the hairs in your ear canal? - asked the old man. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Never felt.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Here you go. And these picozuchki because it is called that very small. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- How do they create silence?</font></font> - I asked. <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúI thought you yourself would guess,‚Äù said Vsevolod Vladimirovich. - The bug that receives the sound at the ear entrance transmits it to those bugs that are responsible for vibrations of the eardrum. They copy the sound and its power in antiphase, which dampens the sound almost completely. </font></font><br><br><img src="http://4tree.ru/data/1310/clipboard_845.png" alt="image"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Why is it necessary? </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Clear. You, apparently, never rested in complete silence. Just imagine how many conflicts with your neighbors are extinguished with the help of a noise suppressor. After all, you can customize the sheet to take the votes of only those people who are nearby. And in a noisy department store, calmly talk to your spouse without a headache. When you talk on the phone, other sounds are automatically extinguished. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Can I try?</font></font> - I asked.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- And what to do if you do not like foreign objects in the ear? </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- On the sheet, you press the deactivation of the bugs, and they, pressing the legs with the papriceros, take out the sting and fall out of the ear when shaking. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Vsevolod Vladimirovich tilted his head to the side and shook his head, knocking himself on the right ear with his palm. It looked ridiculous, as if he was swimming in the water with his head, and now he was knocking the drops out of his ears. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- The main purpose of these bugs - voice control sheet, - continued the old man. - You can give him commands, he understands everything. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- He can answer?</font></font><br><br>  - Of course.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">After talking with him, you will get used to the fact that you have an understanding friend, a know-it-all. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">He can answer almost any question at any time. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Miracles! </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">You are not for nothing that developed these 1500 years - I said, and admiringly looked around. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Yeah.</font></font> Thank.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Tried, - Vsevolod Vladimirovich smiled. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Continuation can be read from 60 pages in PDF (or 120 page online) on </font></font><a href="http://wezel.ru/"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">wezel.ru The</font></font></a> <br><br><img src="http://wezel.ru/book/screen.png" alt="image"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> book can be downloaded in all formats or read directly on the site. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Distributed freely. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Reviews on the same site.</font></font></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/150005/">https://habr.com/ru/post/150005/</a></p>
