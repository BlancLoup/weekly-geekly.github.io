  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Patrols: out of the dusk somewhere near</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The topic of the ‚Äúdispute between economic entities‚Äù that has arisen around the online game ‚Äú <a href="http://www.habrahabr.ru/company/dozory/">Patrols</a> ‚Äù has already been <a href="http://margoo.habrahabr.ru/blog/25423.html">raised</a> on Habr√©.  But events are evolving, and now we can already offer you new information obtained from a conversation with the participants in the conflict that has flared up. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Let me remind you that on September 12, the servers of the popular browser RPG ‚ÄúPatrols.  Forbidden Game ‚Äùsuddenly ceased to work, which immediately agitated the Internet community and brought to the surface previously not too advertised information about the change of ownership and general director of Dozory LLC, which owns the game project. <br><br>  From the <a href="http://alermo.livejournal.com/29054.html">story of</a> Alexander Ermolaev, the technical director of the creator of the game - the company STORK, which before the described events carried out the operational management of the project and its support, it became known that the servers were stopped due to the intervention of people who closed access to them from outside.  While copying data from them, one of the servers burned down. <br><br>  These ‚Äúpeople‚Äù obviously represented Evolution of Entertainment LLC, which in May 2006 bought 50% of the share capital from STORK.  As a result, the newly created joint venture Dozory LLC became the owner of the game project, in which 50% of the assets were given to the owner of the ER Dmitry Itskov, and the rest was divided equally between three individuals: Gennady Lelyuk, Mikhail Paulkin and Oleg Volobuyev.  The post of general director Ltd. went to Mr. Lelyuk.

      However, on August 30 of this year, at an extraordinary meeting of shareholders, Lelyuk was removed from his post, and Itskov was elected in his place.  In addition, all 100% of the assets of Dozorov were transferred to Mr. Itskov.  The entire procedure for the change of ownership took place without the participation of three former co-owners of the LLC.  At the time of this writing, the operational management and technical support of the online game was assumed by the team of Newmedia Stars, associated with Dmitry Itskov.  The STORK specialists are completely removed from management. <br><br>  Mr. Itskov kindly agreed to answer a few of my questions.  I give a short interview with him without cuts. <br><br>  <strong>Has the charter of Dozory LLC stipulated a procedure for the absentee removal of its co-owners without a court decision?</strong> <br><br>  All changes that have occurred have been stipulated in the statute and made within the framework of the law.  If our opponents want, they can try to go to court.  We are ready to defend our case. <br><br>  <strong>How can you respond to the statements of Alexander Yermolaev that the Newmedia Stars team will not be able to maintain the performance and develop the Dozors project at the proper level?</strong> <br><br>  We transferred 4 of our web programmers to the project and, if necessary, we will temporarily strengthen the team.  I must say that the software part of the game is quite complicated.  3 years of muddled development of the project have contributed.  But we will understand this, and in the next two weeks we will take everything under complete control. <br><br>  <strong>What priorities do you set for yourself, as for the new leader of the ‚ÄúWatch‚Äù?</strong> <br><br>  Of course, I myself cannot carry out the operational management of the project ( <em>Dmitry Itskov, among other things, is also the general director of the Internet newspaper <a href="http://vz.ru/">Vzglyad</a></em> , <strong>my comment</strong> ).  I plan to involve in the management of someone from the active players who have a lot of experience and weight in the project. <br><br>  <strong>So the old team will no longer manage the project under any circumstances?</strong> <br><br>  We would like to see the old team as technical consultants.  But now, when the project is in a state of deep ideological and financial crisis, I cannot allow the old team to direct management. <br><br>  <strong>How serious expenses will be required, in your opinion, to bring the project to a state at least the end of last year?</strong> <br><br>  Investments will be required, first of all, in the development team, in the project management and marketing.  The last two points of the last 9 months due to the fault of our partners were completely absent.  I think this will require about $ 200,000-300,000.  We are ready to invest these funds without attracting foreign investment. <br><br>  <strong>Are there any deadlines in which the project should reach such indicators that were at its peak in December 2006?</strong> <br><br>  I think that by the end of this year we will be able to achieve the indicators that were at the end of last year. <br><br>  <strong>Did you talk to the former co-owners of Dozor, who had their shares in the company taken away?</strong> <br><br>  I have already said many times that I am ready to discuss with them the solution of a conflict situation.  But they do not respond to meeting requests.  Consultations are underway with Sergey Lukyanenko, he understands what the situation is and is very concerned.  We expect that he will act as an intermediary in organizing and holding a meeting between us and the opposite side. <br><br>  The other side of the conflict described her vision and attitude to the situation in the <a href="http://dozory2.ru/bbs/viewtopic.php%3Ft%3D324">topic</a> on the Dozory-2 website, which was created as an alternative to the original game website.  Perhaps I have nothing to add to it.  I hope Michael Paulkin, Gennady Lelyuk and Oleg Volobuev will leave their comments here. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/14257/">https://habr.com/ru/post/14257/</a></p>
