They often need your help when it comes to social interaction with other Homo sapiens.  A non-programmer can use this set of ‚Äúbest practices‚Äù if he wants to effectively spoil his relationship with developers. <br><br><h3>  1. Start talking to the developer only when he is in headphones. </h3><br>  We are all familiar with this strange behavior.  A common feature of all developers is that they are introverts.  When they put on headphones, they signal to you that they are tired of their current work and urgently need social interaction.  Do not make the developer wait too long and hurry to him with fresh office gossip or a new bug in the software. <a name="habracut"></a>

    <h3>  2. Never ask the developer his opinion about the new idea. </h3><br>  Programmers, as a rule, have a firm opinion about the things that they have to develop.  Sometimes they say that the feature is bad because it will affect other parts of the system or will take too long to implement.  Never discuss these topics with the developers.  These are excuses.  The usual behavior among developers to avoid the work ahead. <br><br><h3>  3. If you need something As Soon As Possible, ask the developer to do it. </h3><br>  We were all in such a situation when the boss needed an updated report and you decided that you had enough of this work for today.  Feel free to reload this job on the developer.  Report the status of the task ‚Äúas soon as - so immediately‚Äù (ASAP), and the developer will immediately begin working on your project. <br><br><h3>  4. Assume that each development task takes the same amount of time. </h3><br>  Yesterday, the developer added a new functionality in less than 2 hours?  This, of course, means that the other feature you have planned will take the same amount of development time.  Ask to finish it in 2 hours. <br><br><h3>  5. Change plan </h3><br>  Sometimes your developers need a shake.  If you thought that they are bored (something works all the time without problems), then change the plan.  You can do this by creating new tasks.  All that comes to your mind.  Shuffle the tickets entered into the work planning system between the developers.  Of course, you can do this every few days to keep the team alert. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/dd/d6/59ddd6467ea2f175840109.jpeg"><br><br><h3>  6. Keep telling developers you're a programmer too. </h3><br>  Since all developers are more or less afraid of the tricks of non-technical managers, you can infiltrate their ranks by ‚Äúpretending‚Äù to be a developer.  Tell them you're a programmer too, and show them what you wrote in HTML.  They most often appreciate it.  Only a few developers will tell you that HTML is not a real programming language.  If this happens, then ignore it, because you just met with the so-called system engineer or backend-developer. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/dd/d5/59ddd5f3c1063736597985.jpeg" width="600"><br><br><h3>  7. Explain to developers which languages ‚Äã‚Äãand frameworks they should use. </h3><br>  Sometimes it is pleasant to give developers advice on programming languages, frameworks or libraries.  If your new neighbor tells you that his company is now using jQuery, this is a clear sign that you must use the same technology in your Android or iOS application. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/dd/dc/59dddcb535b32238899366.png" width="600"><br><br><h3>  8. Say that a new website should work in IE8 </h3><br>  Developers - people prone to nostalgia.  They like some unfashionable things, like old arcade games from the eighties.  In general, they deeply respect the technologies created in the past.  Make it pleasant and say that the new website should also work correctly in older versions of the famous Internet Explorer. <br><br><h3>  9. If you have questions about a specific <a href="https://cloud4y.ru/cloud-services/microsoft-office-rent/">Word / Excel / Powerpoint</a> feature, contact the developer. </h3><br>  Whenever you find yourself in a situation in which you don‚Äôt understand how to make something work in Excel or a similar tool, contact the developer for help.  All developers are experts in office software tools and are happy when they can share their knowledge.  They are also happy to help with an office multifunction printer. <br><br><h3>  10. Always organize meetings. </h3><br>  Oddly enough, most developers hate to communicate via email or chat.  If you are in a rare situation, when you still can not do without the advice or opinion of the developer - organize a meeting.  The meeting room will give the developer enough space to express his thoughts and make a presentation on the solution of your question. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/dd/da/59ddda07c74a4297380612.jpeg"><br><h3>  Conclusion </h3><br>  After reading these theses, you may come to the conclusion that you should not do any of this.  Programming requires a deep understanding of technology and a lot of thought.  It takes time.  Be careful, interrupting the work of the developer for his current task.  In this case, there is every chance that you like the developers.  Now send them 1 funny gif or comic to make them happier. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/dd/c9/59ddc9ded0a95224963401.png"><br>  <i>For example, such.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/339818/">https://habr.com/ru/post/339818/</a></p>
