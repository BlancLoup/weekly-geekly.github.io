In terms of the number of gold awards, the Russian national team ranked fifth due to the difference in points, and in the unofficial overall medal standings, senior pupils shared seventh place with representatives from the UK.

      This year Russia was represented by three students from Moscow, two from St. Petersburg and one from Rybinsk. <br><br>  The best in the Russian team turned out to be Grigory Yurgin, who perfectly coped with four tasks out of six and took 19-21 place with a score of 33 points out of 42. Also gold awards were given to Ruslan Salimov (31 points), Ivan Frolov (30 points) and Pavel Gubkin ( 29 points).  Nikita Karagodin earned a silver medal (23 points), Georgy Veprev (19 points) won the national team bronze. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The maximum possible number of gold medals was collected by representatives of the United States (6 of 6), followed by South Korea, China and Singapore, as well as students from Russia, took four gold awards per team. <br><br>  The best at the Olympiad were expected to be from Asia.  First place with a score of 42 points is shared by the representative of China, three students from South Korea and two Americans (Allen Liu, Yuan Yao).  In addition, pupils from Singapore (4 medals), Taiwan (3 medals), Hong Kong (3 medals), North Korea (2 medals), Great Britain (2 medals) and Japan (1 medal) pleased their mentors with gold awards.  A complete list of winners can be <a href="https://www.imo-official.org/year_individual_r.aspx%3Fyear%3D2016%26column%3Dtotal%26order%3Ddesc">found on the IMO official website</a> . <br><br>  This indicator of the Russian national team can be considered a success, because last year the guys could not take a single gold and returned home with silver awards. <br><br>  Absolutely all the gold medalists of the Russian Federation failed to cope with the last, sixth task, gaining 3, 2, 1 and 0 points for it, respectively, to their places in the final table.  Also, all of them, except Yurgin, had problems with task number 3.  But, unlike his comrades, who scored the maximum number of points for task # 2, Gregory did not cope with it, having lost 5 points (earned 2 of 7 possible).  Of course, this affected the position in the points rating, but did not affect the quality of the awards: all four took gold. <br><br>  In total, 602 students from 109 countries took part in the competition.  In addition, in May of this year, the team of St. Petersburg State University <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/edison/blog/301244/">won the student programming world championship</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/305766/">https://habr.com/ru/post/305766/</a></p>
