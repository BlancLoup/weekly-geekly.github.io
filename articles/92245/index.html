The choice was made about one and a half months ago with the ‚Äúmonster communication +‚Äù tariff plan. <br><br>  Today, by chance, I learned that I have activated the ‚Äúconference call‚Äù service, for which, according to the <a href="">tariff</a> , a daily subscription fee of 3.10 rubles is charged.  First of all, I called the support service with a request to disable this service (as unnecessary).  Then he began to understand, read more carefully the description of the tariff and found out that <strong>the ‚Äúconference call‚Äù service is not included in the list of services that are automatically connected</strong> : <br><blockquote>  Automatically connect services: <br>  * Receive / send SMS <br>  * GPRS-Internet, GPRS-WAP, MMS <br>  * Caller ID <br>  * Talking letter <br></blockquote><br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Accordingly, I had a question: what day did I pay for a service that I didn‚Äôt connect and which I didn‚Äôt use?  I asked the same question to the support service (0611).  About the following dialogue took place: <br><blockquote>  - Hello, the operator is such and such, how can I help you? <br>  - Good day.  Tell me, please, what is the tariff plan for the number from which I am calling? <br>  - Your tariff plan - ‚Äúmonster communication plus‚Äù <br>  - Good.  On the ‚Äúmonster communication plus‚Äù tariff plan, four services are automatically connected: (I am listing, reading from the site).  Today, at my request, the conference call service has been disabled on this number.  It interests me on what basis it was connected at all, if, according to the description of the tariff, this service is not included in the list of services connected automatically, I did not create a request to connect this service and I did not agree with its connection. <br>  - Wait, please, one minute, I will clarify ... Yes, indeed, this service was mistakenly activated.  On behalf of the company, I apologize for the inconvenience. <br>  - No, that's not enough for me.  I will only agree to recalculation and refund for each day when the subscription fee for this service was written off. <br>  - Well, let me create an application and it will be reviewed within 24 hours. <br>  ... <br></blockquote>

      The day has not passed yet, there is no result of consideration of the application.  It will probably be considered positive and the funds will be returned to the account.  The amount, of course, is small - about 130-150 rubles.  But the very fact of unreasonable write-off made me call. <br><br>  Perhaps this information is useful to someone.  What can you advise? <br>  1. find out your tariff plan by calling 067405 or * 110 * 05 # (free of charge) <br>  2. study the description of your <a href="">tariff</a> and the list of automatically connected services <br>  3. recall which services were previously connected ‚Äî manually or through an operator <br>  4. Call the support service at 0611 and find out the list of connected services for which a daily or monthly subscription fee is charged. <br>  5. in the presence of something "superfluous" - to act on the situation. <br><br>  <strong>UPD</strong> from <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/mypuk/" class="user_link">mypuk</a> user: <br><blockquote>  Calling to the TP is a long and not always possible matter, for example, in roaming. <br>  You can check your account, connected services and, if necessary, disconnect them through <br>  <a href="https://uslugi.beeline.ru/">uslugi.beeline.ru</a> <br>  In the same place, in the ‚ÄúFinancial Information‚Äù section, you can view account details in order to find out when a service was activated. <br></blockquote></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/92245/">https://habr.com/ru/post/92245/</a></p>
