  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Global City Hackathon: Nizhny Novgorod - the first</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Nizhny Novgorod is a very interesting city from the point of view of the IT landscape.  The list of companies whose offices are located in our city is really impressive: the Russian office of Intel, MERA, MFI Soft, EPAM, Auriga, Five9, NetCracker, Luxoft, Citadel ... In our city, standards for 5G, SORM, CRM systems, games are being created. DivoGames aka GI and Adore Games, online document editors, world-famous products for working with video and audio, and so on.  And if you plunge into the world of IT a little deeper, then you can find developers of global projects, such as, for example, SAP, who work remotely from home. <br><br> <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/447044/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/db3/3f5/b4f/db33f5b4f82db6cfb5ae06914178c51c.jpg"></a> <br>  <i><font color="#999999">Minin and Pozharsky Square - the main square of Nizhny Novgorod</font></i> <br><br>  Vooot.  And in the city itself there is a lot to improve and improve - to develop infrastructure, monitoring, environmental issues, employment, education, health and sports.  In general, the typical life and typical problems of a million-plus city with the difference that Nizhny Novgorod has unique features: it is a tourist attractive city with an ancient history, it is an industrial city with interesting and cool businesses, now it is a city with a great stadium, and of course with unique geographical location at the confluence of the Oka and Volga.

      So what for hakaton? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Nizhny Novgorod became the first city in Russia where the Global City Hackathon project started! </h2><br>  Do you care about our city?  Any ideas how to make it better, more convenient, more technological? <br><blockquote><h4>  <i><a href="https://www.it52.info/events/2019-04-19-global-city-hackathon">‚Üí Register and come April 19!</a></i> </h4></blockquote>  Within three days, participants will develop prototypes of digital services to solve actual urban problems, and you can become one of them! <br><br>  <b>Solutions can be developed in three directions:</b> <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Available city.</b>  Accessible urban environment (including for people with limited mobility), support for the elderly and people with disabilities. <br></li><li>  <b>Wasteless city</b> .  The transition to a closed loop economy.  Efficiency and transparency of work on the collection, removal and disposal of garbage, reuse of resources, environmental monitoring, environmental education. <br></li><li>  <b>Open city</b> .  The collection, storage, processing and provision of data to meet the needs of urban services, the business community, citizens and tourists. <br></li></ul><br>  Urban services experts from other cities and countries, as well as technology experts in areas that can be applied (IoT, Big Data, Predictive Analytics, AI, GIS and GPS, Web and Mobile) will come to Nizhny Novgorod to help develop solutions. <br>  The result of the hackathon will be the creation of prototypes of IT services and products that will make the life of people in the city more comfortable, and the best solutions will receive support for development! <br><br>  You can come with a ready-made team or join a team on the court. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#004d00">A few tips from the author of this mini-post - how to spend the time of the hakaton with benefit?</font> </h2><br><ul><li>  Think in advance about which problem is closer to your subject.  Collect information, learn Russian and foreign experience.  Write out the main ideas that inspired you - do not count on your head, everything will fly out at the most inopportune moment. <br></li><li>  Bring your laptop, smartphone (s), backup Internet access point (whistle or mobile package rate), chargers.  The most annoying when in the midst of the heat and the development of something sharply chopped off and stop working. <br></li><li>  Try to look at the problem from different angles: as a resident, as a consumer of a service-product-project, as a city government - there should be no conflict of interests or, for example, assumptions about the violation of something (SDA, law, administrative rules). <br></li><li>  Quickly check if the idea has not already been implemented - with whom it did not happen when you start working out and inspiredly and - oops!  - everything is thought up to us. <br></li><li>  If you work as a team, assign roles and responsibilities in advance.  Advice except for jokes - take with you someone who will ensure the viability of the team: carry tea and water, charge devices, communicate with the organizers and just act as a ‚Äúcritic-amateur‚Äù.  Such people are priceless. <br></li><li>  Do not forget a pair of pens and notebook.  Excess does not happen, even if issued. <br></li></ul><br>  And great luck to you!  This city needs its hero :-) <br><br><hr><blockquote>  When?  <a href="">April 19, 2019 12:00</a> <br><br>  Where?  <a href="http://maps.yandex.ru/%3Ftext%3D%25D0%259D%25D0%2598%25D0%2596%25D0%259D%25D0%2595%25D0%2592%25D0%259E%25D0%259B%25D0%2596%25D0%25A1%25D0%259A%25D0%2590%25D0%25AF%2520%25D0%259D%25D0%2590%25D0%2591%25D0%2595%25D0%25A0%25D0%2595%25D0%2596%25D0%259D%25D0%2590%25D0%25AF,%25209/3">NIZHNIAVOLZHSKAYA NABEREZHNAYA, 9/3</a> <br><br>  <a href="https://www.it52.info/events/2019-04-19-global-city-hackathon"><b>‚Üí Registration here</b></a> </blockquote></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/447044/">https://habr.com/ru/post/447044/</a></p>
