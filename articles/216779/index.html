  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The registry of prohibited sites as a way to information isolation</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Inspired by the publication on Habr√© ( <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/sandbox/69290/">http://habrahabr.ru/sandbox/69290/</a> ) about the production of consumables for a 3d-printer, I decided to go to the manufacturer‚Äôs website ( <a href="http://www.extrusionbot.net/">http://www.extrusionbot.net/</a> ) and ... Bingo!  "Access to the requested resource is limited."  I would decide that there are indeed calls for separatism, child pornography or amphetamine recipes, but the guys just produce and sell industrial machines for geeks and businesses.  (UPD: as reported in the comments, on this ip there are still 169020 sites) Having logged in through a proxy, I found a quiet, peaceful startup there trying to make the world a better place and, for some reason, forbidden, like the other 169019 resources.  In the article, free reasoning on the topic and an attempt to understand what is usually passed as known. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  It would be possible to close the tab and remain silent, I already received the necessary information from this site.  Well banned, and so what?  We speculate a little, not as a consumer or an entrepreneur, but as an ‚Äúengineer of the economic branch‚Äù.  Lazy and gullible can immediately go to the next paragraph.  A bit of business mathematics: 3d printing on an order in Moscow costs about 10-20 rubles per gram, a finished piece weighing 10 pounds will cost 10-20 thousand - inconceivably expensive.  We begin to understand what is happening, printers are sold for 30-90 thousand, which is quite acceptable for their service life.  Consumables cost 1500-3000 rubles per kilogram of plastic.  It turns out the printers make a premium of about 500%.  Dumping and price war could save the situation and make 3-d printing more accessible, but even when printing at the price of consumables, the parts still get expensive.  We begin to dig further: in China, a kilogram of ABS thread (one of the most common materials for 3d printing) costs about $ 12, but the delivery (even with large bulk) costs as much again, we get about 1000 rubles per kilogram.  After 10-20 thousand, the price is 1000r.  It seems cheap, but for good it is draconian prices.  Recently I saw a sleigh-sled in Auchan for 12 rubles (for about 100 grams of weight), that‚Äôs what the cheap price means.  We begin to dig further, ABS plastic granules cost about 250 rubles per kilogram.  The equipment presented on the above-mentioned prohibited site costs about 30,000 rubles and allows producing about 5 kilograms of filament per day or 150 kilograms per month.  That is, the sale of 400 rubles per kilogram with sufficient competition is quite realistic.  We will leave 30% of the margin to printers (the average profitability of the business in the world is about 10%, the remaining 20% ‚Äã‚Äãfor rent and labor) and get a 3d print for 600 rubles per kilogram (or 60 kopecks per gram).  At such a price, 3d printing would be really massive, robotics, open source hardware and much more would quickly develop. <br><br>  Why all this?  Moreover, our enterprises could not be competitive tomorrow, but now.  A 3d print of 60 kopecks / gram is a very real scenario.  Our people are incredibly clever and open Internet has allowed our IT-specialists to become one of the strongest in the world.  It seems to me that the main reason for the decline in the industry of the Soviet Union is not communism as such, but censorship.  Censorship breeds ignorance, ignorance breeds inefficiency and non-competitiveness.  Of course, we must protect our children from violence on the screen.  Protect our not-so-clever fellow citizens who have the right to vote and their fists from obvious slander and zombies in the media.  But censorship must be put under tight public scrutiny.  When an official individually prohibits watching what should help increase GDP and other absolutely good goals, is that right? <br><br>  The article does not condemn in any way and does not praise the power; it does not have political coloring.  I want this article to have like-minded people who, independently of each other, to the best of their ability, promote the openness of the Internet.  I want us to take from our foreign colleagues the best methods, learn from them, but not allow us to manipulate (for which censorship was created).  I am sure we can find a tool that takes into account the interests of all parties and does not contribute to the country's intellectual lag behind the world community.  Write ideas in the comments. </div>
