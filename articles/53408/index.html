Among them there is a new project on the sensational domain top4top.ru, and contextual advertising aggregator, which Ashmanov and Lebedev have worked on, and a simulator that will measure your ability to knock on the keys and even issue a certificate, and much more. <br>  In addition, this is the last rating in this format.  Starting in March, I‚Äôm not you, but you will be the one to place startups.

Selling, exchanging, or simply giving them to someone a gift.  For example, there you can buy a hard drive (120G) for 500 rubles, a video card (Radeon x1650) for 700 rubles, or exchange iPod Shuffle for something.

      <b>Evgeny Makushkin (Developer):</b> <i>‚ÄúProbably, you have unnecessary things, it can be anything from small digital appliances and clothes to old furniture or a refrigerator.</i>  <i>And all this quite often just gathering dust in a corner and does not bring you any good.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>The question arises: ‚ÄúWhat to do with this?‚Äù A fairly common way to get rid of an old or unnecessary thing is to throw it in the trash, but it can also be of benefit to you and other people.</i>  <i>My-sale.ru - a place where you can arrange your own sale.</i>  <i>Sell, exchange or give away a thing you do not need. ‚Äù</i> <br><br><h4>  9th place </h4><br> <a href="http://idopda.ru/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/687/59b/05f/68759b05ff5262c3cfaad90a64a06011.jpg" alt="http://idopda.ru"></a> <br>  <a href="http://idopda.ru/">http://idopda.ru</a> <br><br>  IDoPDA is a script that will allow you to make a mobile version of your project, if it is made on Wordpress or Joomla!  The script processes the base of the site and displays them in a PDA-oriented format.  The mobile version of the site, in the form of pda.website.ru, is able to create menus and content from the existing site, authorize users, and even add comments. <br><br>  <b>Ruslan Ziatdinov (Founder of the project):</b> <i>‚ÄúRecently, among web developers, the issue of creating a‚Äú mobile ‚Äùversion of websites has become increasingly important.</i>  <i>Demand creates supply and further confirmation of this - the emergence of a free IDoPDA script.</i>  <i>With IDoPDA, creating a ‚Äúmobile‚Äù site, as they say, is nowhere easier.</i>  <i>The webmaster is required to complete only a few simple steps.</i>  <i>The script is free and distributed under a CreativeCommons license ¬ª</i> <br><br><h4>  8th place </h4><br> <a href="http://top4top.ru/"><img src="http://t4t.corvin.ru/images/logo.gif?1236075843" alt="http://top4top.ru"></a> <br>  <a href="http://top4top.ru/">http://top4top.ru</a> <br><br>  Topfortop is not top4top at all.  On the basis of this domain, an absolutely new project has been made, with absolutely new people who have nothing in common with Dibrov and his community for intellectuals.  Now this is a project where you can chat with your idols. <br><br>  <b>Sergey Mirov (Project Leader):</b> <i>‚ÄúAgainst the background of a large flow of various low-grade‚Äú creativity, ‚Äùmany good musicians, writers, artists, scientists, politicians and sportsmen lack feedback from their fans.</i>  <i>I hope that the Darwinian principle of natural selection will work in the future: even if janitor Uncle Vasya himself declares himself an idol - if he finds himself in the list below the plinth, he will immediately understand everything.</i>  <i>By the way, the real popularity rating will come to light ¬ª</i> <br><br><h4>  7th place </h4><br> <a href="http://zakupator.ru/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d90/e80/94e/d90e8094e602951b81842c713fe361da.jpg" alt="http://zakupator.ru"></a> <br>  <a href="http://zakupator.ru/">http://zakupator.ru</a> <br><br>  A purchaser is a service for organizing joint purchases.  The point is that if you want to buy one iPod, it will cost you 7999 rubles.  And if you find 10 more people who want to buy an iPod, then you can get a discount, and the player of your dream will rise to you only 7,499 rubles. <br><br>  <b>Alexey Zyuzin (Developer):</b> <i>‚ÄúThe concept of joint ventures, joint purchases already exists on the Internet.</i>  <i>But they are distributed only in thematic women's forums, at least - automotive.</i>  <i>But everyone can save on the purchase in bulk: long-lasting products, clothing (for example, thermal underwear), products for cars, etc.</i>  <i>Therefore, the purpose of the Purchaser is to promote the joint venture "</i> <br><br><h4>  6th place </h4><br> <a href="http://turbofilm.ru/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b6f/00f/263/b6f00f263ae730cb2ca7ed398b99e5a5.jpg" alt="http://turbofilm.ru"></a> <br>  <a href="http://turbofilm.ru/">http://turbofilm.ru</a> <br><br>  Western TV shows and sitcoms have long captured the domestic audience.  Lost, Dr. House, Escape, Heroes, Computer geeks, Friends and other TV shows can now be viewed in good quality on Turbofilm.  You do not need to have a dimensionless channel; if your Internet speed is above 500 kb / s, then this is quite enough. <br><br>  <b>Developer:</b> <i>‚ÄúHigh quality is due to the use of properly tuned modern codecs, but the quality is still lower than any licensed copy.</i>  <i>At the same time, the site uses translations of such well-known providers as LostFilm.TV and NovaFilm.</i>  <i>The video on ‚ÄúTurbofilm‚Äù appears somewhat later than, for example, on LostFilm: as stated on the site, the delay is very high - 3-4 days, but in reality the delay is several hours.</i>  <i>Since ‚ÄúTurbofilm‚Äù was opened quite recently, we have not yet had time to get acquainted with all the authors of the translations, but, of course, we will go forward and, as far as we can, we will help ‚Äù</i> <br><br><h4>  5th place </h4><br> <a href="http://planary.ru/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a93/39d/6f7/a9339d6f7334da12fe3155f52aa2cb10.jpg" alt="http://planary.ru"></a> <br>  <a href="http://planary.ru/">http://planary.ru</a> <br><br>  Planarium will help you never forget what you need to do.

Or how much should the market value of the apartment you plan to buy be.  In a word, with the help of this project, you can find out the cost of absolutely any Moscow apartment. <br><br>  <b>Kirill Bezrukov (Developer):</b> <i>‚ÄúWe built a mathematical model around the city on the basis of transactions and announcements, which takes into account the geographical coordinates of the house and objects of influence, such as the metro, shops, and children.</i>  <i>gardens, schools, landfills, highways, etc.</i>  <i>There is also another remarkable property of the model - it improves itself over time and takes into account more and more factors.</i>  <i>Now the model is recalculated once a week, we will continue to update every day. ‚Äù</i> <br><br><h4>  2nd place </h4><br> <a href="http://vse10.ru/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/efa/43f/db3/efa43fdb319c06fff06a25defadd2d18.jpg" alt="http://vse10.ru"></a> <br>  <a href="http://vse10.ru/">http://vse10.ru</a> <br><br>  All 10 is a typing tutor online.  It seems that Shahidzhanyan‚Äôs golden times are becoming a thing of the past.  With the help of a new project you can learn how to blindly type on the keyboard, and even get a certificate certifying your typing speed. <br><br>  <b>Andrei Borovik (Developer):</b> <i>‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt need to download and install anything else - learning is now easy and convenient.</i>  <i>In addition to training, you can also check your typing speed, obtain an appropriate certificate, and compete in a rating with other site visitors. ‚Äù</i> <br><br><h4>  1 place </h4><br> <a href="http://blondinka.ru/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/321/eb6/259/321eb6259a8d87410f22813da76fe51e.png" alt="http://blondinka.ru"></a> <br>  <a href="http://blondinka.ru/">http://blondinka.ru</a> <br><br>  Blonde.Ru - a project from the company "Ashmanov and Partners" with the design from the studio Lebedev designed to make contextual advertising accessible and understandable to all.  Blonde aggregates and makes it easier to manage all the most popular contextual advertising systems: Runner, Yandex.Direct, Google AdWords.  Using the service, you can place ads on three platforms at once, manage them, receive reports. <br><br>  <b>Igor Ashmanov:</b> <i>‚ÄúWhy do we need such aggregators - very simple.</i>  <i>When you have five words for which you need to place ads, you can learn three user interfaces (and on the way there are five more from Hermann Klimenko, Kavang, etc.).</i>  <i>And when you have a large store, there may be 10,000 ads. Here, in any case, automation is needed, efficiency analysis, rate tracking, quick removal and installation of words by the hundreds, automatic generation of ad texts, etc.</i>  <i>You can contact the agency - but then such an automation is needed by the agency itself.</i>  <i>And if it is programmed in the agency - why not make a public service.</i>  <i>This is how aggregators of the Kyrgyz Republic arise. ‚Äù</i> <i><br></i> <br><br><h4>  Nine other startups of February: </h4><br>  <a href="http://advirtus.ru/">advirtus.ru</a> - A project that will help manage your habits <br>  <a href="http://greatwords.ru/">greatwords.ru</a> - Collection of aphorisms. <br>  <a href="http://navkontakte.ru/">navkontakte.ru</a> - Create avatars and photos for albums VKontakte. <br>  <a href="http://muzey-factov.ru/">muzey-factov.ru</a> - A collection of amazing facts <br>  <a href="http://automobilisty.ru/">automobilisty.ru</a> - Social network for car enthusiasts. <br>  <a href="http://ya-ya.ru/">ya-ya.ru</a> - Internet newspaper of free announcements. <br>  <a href="http://newsed.ru/">newsed.ru</a> - A system for exchanging interesting links (similar to reddit.com) <br>  <a href="http://avatator.ru/">avatator.ru</a> - Service that will help to stylize your avatar. <br>  <a href="http://kinoestet.ru/">kinoestet.ru</a> - Recommended film service. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/53408/">https://habr.com/ru/post/53408/</a></p>
