Expensive, prestigious but ... ...</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c59/c70/d58/c59c70d58bfc4ab9b9ccb5f48d874a50.png"><br>  Recently, LEGO Education has released a <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/legoeducation/blog/283244/">post</a> with a story about its new set of LEGO Education WeDo 2.0.  Marketers (who wrote this article) were very modestly silent about the prices of this set, and also about some surprises waiting for those who bought this set.  I will say straight away that I do not pretend to study this issue in depth, I just went over the websites of the stores selling this toy and carefully read the pages.  To be honest, what I saw was a little shocked.  But let's start in order. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  This set is positioned as a direct path for your child to the prestigious and sought-after profession of an engineer.  Even KDPV picked up the appropriate <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/647/b85/809/647b85809ca9997666a0161546100caf.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Unfortunately, this picture does not even fit the described set.  What he really is?  This is a processor unit that has two ports for connection.  As the company representatives themselves expressed in one of their previous posts <br><blockquote>  Please note - the SmartHub has only two inputs, so at the same time you can use either 1 sensor and 1 motor, or two sensors (and admire the ominously frozen robot). </blockquote><br>  That is, about the flight of fancy and a wide range of possible combinations, you can forget.  Although in principle, with a set of sensors suitable for this designer, you can forget about the flight of fantasy in principle.  The kit includes two sensors: a tilt sensor and a motion sensor (infrared optocoupler).  The guys proudly declare that the new sensors have received new features, protection against shaking, etc.  True, they had to replace the type of connector, and the old sensors are no longer suitable.  Not like proprietary connectors from one apple company?  In this case, the sensors from the old and the new version differ in price almost twice

Thus, the child will collect the four described in the attached free (limited) software of the device and this will all end.  At the same time, he will not understand how it all works (the assembly of an electrical circuit is no more difficult than plugging the plug into an outlet), and he will not receive any additional knowledge.  The program included in the package is a slightly advanced radio control system in which you can record a sequence of actions and some reactions to one sensor.  So after talking with this constructor, the engineer will most likely get such <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5ba/6eb/a39/5ba6eba392894297ba2d3a619ff92f53.jpeg"><br>  <b>(JOKE)</b> <br><br>  Naturally, the child will want more, and dad decides to buy the full version of the program.  He will be "pleasantly" surprised. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/470/080/b96/470080b964d54055adafa189bf76ce7b.PNG"></div><br>  Modestly so.  As I understand it there are 12 additional solutions.  In general, an interesting practice, when the software for the device is two times more than the device itself. <br><br>  I think it's time to talk about pricing.  As always, when high prices are justified, they talk about a large development process, super materials and complex technologies used in the product.  Let's go through the comparison method. <br><br>  Now I have a Highscreen BAY phone in my hands.  Its price today is 12990 rubles.  The price of a set of LEGO Education WeDo 2.0 - 14 600 rubles.  The phone is even cheaper, but still compare them. <br><br>  <b>Highscreen BAY Phone</b> <br><table><tbody><tr><td>  OS: </td><td>  Android 5.1 Lollipop </td></tr><tr><td>  CPU: </td><td>  8-core, MediaTek MT6753, 1.3 GHz </td></tr><tr><td>  Video Processor: </td><td>  Mali-t720 </td></tr><tr><td>  Display: </td><td>  5.5 "720x1280, HD OGS, AMOLED </td></tr><tr><td>  Number of SIM cards: </td><td>  2 </td></tr><tr><td>  Type of SIM-cards: </td><td>  Micro-sim </td></tr><tr><td>  Battery: </td><td>  Li-pol 3150 mAh, removable </td></tr><tr><td>  Networks: </td><td>  GSM / GPRS / EDGE (850/900/1800/1900 MHz);  3G / HSPA + (900/2100 MHz);  4G / LTE (3/7/8/20) </td></tr><tr><td>  Main camera: </td><td>  13.0 MP, AF, flash </td></tr><tr><td>  Front-camera: </td><td>  5.0 MP </td></tr><tr><td>  Size of permanent memory: </td><td>  16 GB </td></tr><tr><td>  RAM size: </td><td>  2 GB </td></tr><tr><td>  Expansion slot: </td><td>  microSD (compatible with SDHC) </td></tr><tr><td>  Audio Jack: </td><td>  3.5 mm </td></tr><tr><td>  Wi-Fi: </td><td>  IEEE 802.11 b / g / n, access point </td></tr><tr><td>  Bluetooth: </td><td>  4.0 + EDR (A2DP / HID / PB AP) </td></tr><tr><td>  Navigation: </td><td>  GLONASS / GPS </td></tr><tr><td>  Equipment: </td><td>  Innovative case HiCover, OTG, USB Type-C cable and power supply, headphones, warranty. </td></tr><tr><td>  Additionally: </td><td>  Proximity Sensor, Light Sensor, G-sensor </td></tr></tbody></table><br>  <b>Set LEGO Education WeDo 2.0</b> <br><table><tbody><tr><td>  OS: </td><td>  not </td></tr><tr><td>  CPU: </td><td>  Unknown, but most likely of type ATmega328 </td></tr><tr><td>  Video Processor: </td><td>  Not </td></tr><tr><td>  Display: </td><td>  Not </td></tr><tr><td>  Number of SIM cards: </td><td>  Not </td></tr><tr><td>  Type of SIM-cards: </td><td>  Not </td></tr><tr><td>  Battery: </td><td>  Not.

And what about the fair price this set should have? <br><br>  Well, now let's see the alternatives.  I just want to make a reservation that everything described below is not of an advertising nature, but was found simply by a search in the Yandex market, and of some personal experience (I have a son, almost four years, and I very much hope that he will follow in my footsteps). <br><br>  For the little ones.  First, designers without electronics (you can say the alternative to the usual Lego). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/03b/bbe/b89/03bbbeb899b4446488526b6c452d2044.PNG"><br><br>  This is a whole series of designers, available absolutely to any family, and what is important, the parts from different sets are interchangeable. <br><br>  Electronic constructors.  Also a series. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/11c/04e/b54/11c04eb54d6c4a3c880440a09c78f42a.PNG"><br><br>  Of course, they are more expensive, but with the help of them you can really send a child to the engineering field.  At my house one such (320 schemes) is waiting for the son to grow up.  The kit includes an excellent brochure with diagrams, description of the work of the elements.  But even this price is available to most.  And of course the elements of the entire series are interchangeable.  You can do with five years. <br><br>  Well, when the child masters these sets (years to 8 - 10), you can already begin to more serious things.  Unfortunately, I did not find anything suitable in Russia, but as always, our Chinese brothers come to help, and of course Arduino. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/559/5ed/59b/5595ed59bfa24a51bd46ea8a2d6c0728.PNG"><br><br>  Fully driven (4 engines) robot, remote control, or bluetooth.  Included is a distance sensor (ultrasonic - that is, up to 4 meters), a line monitoring system (it can drive along a drawn line).  Plus an open platform - Arduino.  This means that you can hang additional sensors and sensors. <br><br>  For those who are not keen on robots, there is also a huge number of other sets.  For example, scales: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/754/0f9/2b5/7540f92b565c419db310d592d69ca2be.PNG"><br><br>  Or my favorite - LED cube. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/da7/708/3a7/da77083a747040f192ccddd534e4d496.PNG"><br><br>  This is both a great practice in soldering, and of course just beautiful. <br><br>  I specifically do not give references to these kits.  You just need to type <b><i>arduino diy kit</i></b> in the search bar on the same eBay, or AliExpress and you will see the kits for any color and taste. <br><br>  In addition, their plus is the interchangeability of components, as well as the small cost of errors.  The child (and dad) has the right to make mistakes.  Moreover, he must be mistaken.  Learn from mistakes.  But even if he burns the most expensive in this set - the controller, then the cost of the Arduino Uno is not more than 400 rubles.  The rest is even cheaper. <br><br>  Well, you yourself decide what to take the child.  You can go on doshiraki and buy a child Lego (read, bought off from him).  And go play wot.  Then he proudly shows his friends what toys the child plays (although, most likely in a couple of days he will be lying in the closet).  And you can teach the child something real, helping him learn, and learning for yourself.  Friends, of course, can say - "Fu, Russia, China."  But this is your choice. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/369945/">https://habr.com/ru/post/369945/</a></p>
