At that time, the first applications appeared and when we made our New Year game in November and invited a couple of friends - we quickly received the first 10 thousand installations and in a month grew to 300 thousand without any efforts. <br><br>  So my friend and I had a new hobby.  It is not known why, but we spent all our free time on it, despite the fact that the profit from all this was minimal. <br><a name="habracut"></a>

      This year it all happened again.  There is a ready application, there are a couple of hours a day and you need to add new features and launch it again.  Not for the money - for the usual pleasure.  So did.  This time there was a lot more profit and fewer people.  But still, 250,000 installations and 40 thousand hosts per day we had. <br><br>  Everyone knows about how much the developer will receive, withdrawing a small number of votes from the network, and for those who do not know, <b>2.4-2.6</b> rubles for one vote. <br><br>  And so, having 800 votes in hand, it was decided not to withdraw these funds, but to spend them here.  Without thinking twice, we announced a small contest on our blog, according to the rules of which people who send us interesting ideas for social applications get from 50 to 100 votes sent by Vkontakte using the official method.  In a few days, we received more than 40 letters.  Having selected the most interesting among them, we contacted the authors and each day transferred them the promised votes during the week, since the translation of more than 100 votes is prohibited. <br><br>  This is where the most interesting thing begins and you will never believe what happened :) Our account was simply banned!  Yes, yes, that's right. <br><br>  I never even thought that you can go to the bank for using the functionality provided by the site.  Namely: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/73506ae9/f2380449/a45a0708/48c309b2.png"><br><br>  And of course, having searched the open spaces, I realized that I was most likely banned because I allegedly sold votes.  The last phrase personally puts me in a stupor.  I think the moderators telepathically catch the sale of votes and immediately take action without explanation.  So what?  Remember where we live. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/aace7017/dea58fe4/d264dc53/c05d03c3.png"><br><br>  If 90% of the proceeds go somewhere, then definitely not for development.  Development is when there is at least those.  support. <br><br>  As a naive person, I sent a little more than 2 requests to restore access to the page, 2 letters to those.  support, 2 letters to the press service, as well as a personal message on the <a href="https://geektimes.ru/users/invladis/" class="user_link">invladis Habr√©</a> itself. <br><br>  For two weeks I have not received a single answer to my question, despite the fact that the article <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/vkontakte/blog/100510/">There is no limit to the hoaxes,</a> as it were, hints that everything will be a bundle. <br><br>  I also sent a letter with the subject: ‚ÄúIncorrect treatment‚Äù and, as you already understood, there was no ‚Äúsuper fast‚Äù reaction. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/85901299/fed0a7de/a5088751/03baf8e6.png"><br><br>  Now I have two applications that users have access to, but not me, some amount of local currency blocked on the same page and a Facebook account. <br><br>  All who use this resource - do not make my mistakes and do not fall into the same network.  If you are a developer, withdraw funds and do not let them stand on the accounts, and also do not build illusions that there will be a different relationship to you.  The fact that you have not violated anything does not mean that you will not be banned.  Phrases: ‚ÄúWe support developers‚Äù, ‚ÄúWe need developers‚Äù, etc.  don't matter.  At least for those who are behind everything.  This is a business in Russian, and here those who have more rights are right. <br><br>  <b>UPD:</b> Despite everything, the situation was sorted out and today I was able to log into my account.  In the future, I would like to wish everyone to solve such situations without the help of Habrahabr. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/113247/">https://habr.com/ru/post/113247/</a></p>
