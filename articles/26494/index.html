  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Tasty Monster: The Path to Perfection</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  At age 14, a young American programmer, Mike Matas, created an icon drawing business for OS X applications.  At 15, he was invited to work at the Omni Group.  But after leaving school, he left the company.  <em>‚ÄúIt was fun to work at Omni.</em>  <em>Unfortunately, the company has grown over the past year and the spirit of fun and creativity that I loved, began to disappear, ‚Äù</em> - says Mike. <br><br>  He founded his company, Mad Softworks, and when Will Shipley left Omni, he cooperated with him.  They called the new company Delicious Monster (‚Äúdelicious monster‚Äù, in honor of the plant monstera deliciosa), and sat down to write the first product. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><blockquote>  There were several globular products of this type on the market.  Mike looked at them and said: <em>‚ÄúIf so many ball products do the same thing, then there‚Äôs probably a market for a very elegant program that does it</em> . <em>‚Äù</em>  I call this the iTunes approach: Apple didn't invent the MP3 library and player, but they did them very, very well.

      Will shipley </blockquote><br><br>  <strong>Create hype and exceed all expectations</strong> <br><br>  They decided to make a cool cataloger of books and CDs.  Mike did the design of the interface, and Will wrote the code.  In November 2004, the first version of Delicious Library was released.  For the first month copies were sold for $ 250,000, and not a cent was spent on advertising. <br><br>  Due to the unique functionality (books are on virtual shelves, and adding them to the catalog is easier than ever: scan the barcode via a webcam, and Delicious Library itself downloads information about the book from Amazon), the program created a buzz in the press.  And thanks to a really convenient and beautiful interface, it exceeded user expectations. <br><br>  <strong>Work, not constraining movements</strong> <br><br>  $ 250,000 for the first month of sales is success, and of course, the reason for new articles in newspapers and magazines.  But one of the most interesting facts was that Will and Mike worked in a coffee shop. <br><br>  In the cafe Zoka, in addition to delicious coffee, there is free Wi-Fi, large tables and sockets at each table.  It was there that the Delicious Monster worked and still work today.  Before the cafe, when the company was just starting its way, Will made an office at home, but the company worked there for only a week. <br><br>  The success of Delicious Monster and the amazing work of Mike as a Library interface designer led him to be invited to work at Apple.  Now they are working on the next version of Delicious Library, which has already won the award <em>‚ÄúThe Best Application for Mac OS X Leopard‚Äù</em> . <br><br>  Well, who else doubts the success of the movement ‚Äúfor free work‚Äù?  :) <br><br>  (via <a href="http://office.munga.ru/hakuna_matata/">Munga.ru</a> and <a href="http://sellme.ru/post/18">Sellme.ru</a> ) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/26494/">https://habr.com/ru/post/26494/</a></p>
