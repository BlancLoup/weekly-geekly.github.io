Every day, thousands of new documents are added to the mobile safe.  VKarmane has become an indispensable tool for storing and working with personal documents: passports, bank cards and account details, driver's documents, insurance and others.  Everything that may be needed at the most inopportune moment is now always at hand on your smartphone. <br><br>  Many users store not only their own documents, but willingly add documents of all their loved ones.  You never know where documents may be required for a husband, wife, child, parents. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  VKarmane learned to remind in advance about the expiration of the validity of documents and bank cards.  A trip to the sea will never fail, you will not receive a penalty for expired rights and insurance, and bank cards will always be valid.

      VKarmane has become a symbol of reliability and convenience in the face of many of our users.  Every day people send hundreds of letters and SMS with the details of their documents.  After all, now it became easier than ever to send your passport or bank account information by attaching copies of all the necessary document pages to the letter. <br><br>  Personal data must always be under reliable protection and ‚ÄúVarmarme‚Äù ensures it at a high level. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/zGvA3VqeZng%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhZPYhSL8xNTlA5WBewUKfkSp_7Yg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  But despite all the convenience of storing and working with documents in Varmar, millions of users still fill out their personal data in mobile applications and web sites manually.  Buying air and railway tickets, booking hotels for travel, checking fines and debts, paying for parking, going through identification procedure, paying for purchases with a bank card on the Internet - people have to enter the same data manually every time.  It takes a long time, causes a lot of inconvenience and often leads to errors in filling, which sometimes is fraught with big problems. <br><br>  Without hesitation, we decided to significantly simplify the life of mobile device users and save them a lot of time.  Exactly a year ago, we announced the launch of the API for Varmarte, which can be used by mobile application developers.  During this time, we have entered into a partnership with companies such as <a href="https://www.visatohome.ru/">VisaToHome</a> (visa processing without getting up from the couch), <a href="https://www.ufs-online.ru/">UFS</a> (Railway Tickets online), <a href="http://reactivephone.ru/">Reactive Phone</a> (mobile applications for drivers), <a href="https://www.tinkoff.ru/">Tinkoff Bank</a> (traffic police fines application).  Already, in all these applications, users can fill in all the necessary data in 3 clicks. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/cfb/06b/7a5/cfb06b7a54c38fa7288d32247dc92ab0.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Buying railway tickets can be a challenge if you buy tickets for the whole family or, for example, for a group of football fans.  You will need to fill in the passport details of each person, which will take a lot of time.  With the advent of integration with "Varmanet", the problem disappears.  All that is required is to enter all passports once in the ‚ÄúVarmante‚Äù application and now each time you buy train tickets, you can easily fill in all the necessary data in a few taps.  The user saves his time and nerves, which means he will be happy to recommend this service to all his friends. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/36e/4b2/0b3/36e4b20b3bc86fed2cc0e28a90e1d5be.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  When applying for a visa, you need to collect a whole stack of various documents and references, but with the VisaToHome service, everything has become easier.  Now the visa can be issued without getting up from the sofa, the VisaToHome team will do the rest for you.  But you still have to work hard, you need to load into the application all the necessary scans of documents and references, which takes time.  With the integration of VisaToHome and ‚ÄúVarmane‚Äù, the procedure for applying for a visa is simplified.  Now the data is overseas.  Passports can be automatically filled out from the "Varmane" mobile safe and save your time. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/6d2/2ff/d8c/6d22ffd8cc30e6d0ef9427cdd35e64bc.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Checking and paying fines on mobile devices has become such a popular destination that each company tries to release its own service for checking fines.  One of the market leaders is the ‚ÄúTraffic police fines‚Äù application from Tinkoff Bank.  We are pleased that they are our partners and have implemented integration with ‚ÄúVarmane‚Äù.  Now, instead of manually filling in the data about the driver and vehicle, it‚Äôs enough to click on the ‚ÄúFill from Varmante‚Äù button and all the necessary data will be loaded from the ‚ÄúVarmane‚Äù application. <br><br>  The Varmarme API is available on iOS and Android platforms, and adding the Fill from Varmanet button to your application takes a couple of days for any developer. <br><br>  If in your application, users still fill out the documents manually, then you can‚Äôt imagine what convenience you are depriving them of, until now you have not integrated the solution from Varmarte to you.  Take care of your users and they will reciprocate. <br><br>  Integration requests are accepted at hello@vkarmane.me <br><br>  Varmane website: <a href="http://vkarmane.me/">http://vkarmane.me</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/294166/">https://habr.com/ru/post/294166/</a></p>
