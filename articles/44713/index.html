Sometimes, I want to throw it away.  In fact, the first thought is the most correct one - it really should be thrown away, but behind the wall.  In my case it was a kitchen and a balcony. <a name="habracut"></a><h5>  Lyrical offensive </h5>  To break through the wall of the house and rearrange the system unit - at first this thought strained me like electricity.  Then I realized that it is no more difficult than doing any other work with my hands, changing the cooler, hard drives, and so on.  You just get used to the fact that the system unit should be under the table, and therefore, even when reading, there is some discomfort.  If desired, anything is possible. <h5>  Questions you ask yourself before you start </h5><br>  <b>And what will be the effect?</b> <br>  Turning off the system unit, we carry to the room where we plan to put it, we connect it.  At startup - a severe application that loads the system.  Go back and listen to silence.  Like?  If not, then do not read further. <br><br>  <b>And the length of the wires enough?</b> <br>  If the system unit is placed directly behind the wall, in line with the monitor and the table at which you are sitting, then the standard length of the wires will suffice.  Personally, I did not increase anything in my two cases and did not buy more. <br><br>  <b>Are there wires in the wall?</b> <br>  Of course there is, right in the place where you will make a hole;) Take the wiring detector and make sure that yes, there is a wire there.  Now we move a dozen centimeters to the side.

      <b>Hey, so through one hole will go and the power cables and USB and sound.</b>  <b>Will not the background be?</b> <br>  Damn, you're right.  You will have to make your own tunnel for each cable.  Do not forget to just report this home before starting work.  It is very simple to check - you move the system unit aside and you collect all the wires that you plan to run through one cable in the morning.  <b>Important</b> : it needs to be checked before, drilled the first hole. <br><br>  <b>And vooooooooot such a drill enough?</b> <br>  The most interesting question.  The thickness of the walls seems to be described in the <acronym>SNiP</acronym> , but it is longer to search.  Usually from 8 (drywall and other beauty) to 20 (old brick house) centimeters. <br>  An example from life: it took me a drill of 30 centimeters and 2 hours of work to remove the system unit onto the glassed-in balcony of a classic twelve-story building. <br>  Very often insidious builders leave in the walls all kinds of garbage in the form of iron rods.  They call it reinforcement, so a hole from a perfectly round one, because you want exactly that for yourself?  Turns into a hole from a shot from an enemy cannon. <br><br>  <b>The drill is thin, and the hole should be big.</b>  <b>How to drill?</b> <br>  You draw a circle on the wall and start to drill around the hole, next to each other.  When you go through the whole circle, then start to drill at an angle to connect the holes.  Just do not break the drill.  Then you can work with a chisel and a hammer. <br>  When the hole is ready, first of all, pull the power cable, then make sure that the last wire from the monitor does not creep in and widen the hole a little. <br><br>  Have a good fight with noise.  Who would dare to try - photo in skinnings please. <br>  Pleases the reaction of guests: unusual silence in the room, the monitor is lit.  They look under the table, but there's nothing there. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/44713/">https://habr.com/ru/post/44713/</a></p>
