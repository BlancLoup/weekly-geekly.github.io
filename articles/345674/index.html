  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Product Design Digest, December 2017</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  For seven years now I have been publishing regular reviews of recent articles on the topic of interfaces, new tools and collections of patterns, interesting cases and historical stories.  From the tapes of several hundred thematic subscriptions, approximately 5% of the worthwhile publications are selected that are interesting to share.  Previous materials: <a href="http://www.jvetrau.com/category/digest/">April 2010-November 2017</a> . <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img width="360" height="200" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8a8/735/bcb/8a8735bcb5e3c624eb93c4e0bf0bfcdd.png" alt="Product Design Digest, December 2017"></div><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  <a href="https://t.me/pdigest">Telegram channel</a> format </h3><br>  In November, I launched the <a href="https://t.me/pdigest">Telegram channel</a> and am experimenting with its format.  Just monthly distribution of the latest issue is not enough, and duplicating the Facebook band is useless and labor-intensive - that is why I did not dare to take up Telegram for a year.  The first attempt is an excerpt of the most interesting in the group for the week (for example, about <a href="https://t.me/pdigest/10">trends</a> and <a href="https://t.me/pdigest/9">instruments</a> ), judging by the first reviews, this falls into the readers' expectations.

This applies at least to phone numbers, but there are other fields. </li><li>  Christian Holst from Baymard writes about <a href="https://baymard.com/blog/remove-select-when-only-one-option">what to do if only one item remains in the drop-down list after filtering higher in this form</a> . </li></ul><br>  <strong><a href="https://usabilitylab.ru/blog/rejting-kazakhstan-mobile-2017/">Usability rating of mobile applications of Kazakhstan banks for individuals, 2017</a></strong> <strong><a href="https://usabilitylab.ru/blog/rejting-kazakhstan-mobile-2017/"><br></a></strong>  Using the examples of Kazakhstan banks, UsabilityLab conducted a comparative study and derived a sectoral usability-profile of applications. <br><br><h2>  Design systems and guidelines </h2><br>  <strong><a href="http://designsystemsclub.ru/">Club of creators of domestic design systems</a></strong> <strong><a href="http://designsystemsclub.ru/"><br></a></strong>  This year, many domestic companies have shown their achievements in design systems.  Especially intensified by the fall - every month someone announced its design and technology platform.  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/asundiev">Andrei Sundiyev and I</a> have been working on design systems for a long time and decided to give impetus to their development in Russia we launched the <a href="http://designsystemsclub.ru/">Design Systems Club</a> collection site. <br><br> <a href="http://designsystemsclub.ru/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1cb/bae/68e/1cbbae68e251d14d94e3e91bb97cbdec.png" alt="Design Systems Club" width="780" height="804"></a> <br><br>  The site contains information about companies, about the activity of which we knew for sure: component libraries, articles, presentations, etc.  Now organizations with open live guidelines are presented: <a href="http://designsystemsclub.ru/companies/alfabank.html">Alfa-Bank</a> , <a href="http://designsystemsclub.ru/companies/gov.html">Design of State Systems</a> , <a href="http://designsystemsclub.ru/companies/mailru.html">Mail.Ru Group</a> , <a href="http://designsystemsclub.ru/companies/rambler.html">Rambler &amp; Co</a> , <a href="http://designsystemsclub.ru/companies/yandex.html">Yandex</a> , as well as those who described them in articles: <a href="http://designsystemsclub.ru/companies/acronis.html">Acronis</a> , <a href="http://designsystemsclub.ru/companies/megafon.html">MegaFon</a> and <a href="http://designsystemsclub.ru/companies/tinkoff.html">Tinkoff</a> .  We heard about the developments in several other companies (2GIS, Avito, EastBanc Technologies, Kontur, Raiffeisen, Sberbank, Qiwi), but did not have specific references that could be referred to.  The main criterion for mentioning on the site is that the company is meant by a ‚Äúdesign system‚Äù technological framework, and not a banal UI Kit in Sketch (or a classic guideline in the screenshots).  If we have unfairly forgotten about you or misrepresented in the descriptions - write to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/asundiev">Andrei Sundiev</a> or <a href="https://www.facebook.com/jvetrau">me</a> . <br><br>  We want to spur the exchange of experience between companies and show that everything is not so difficult and quite feasible.  For example, at the end of September, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DIixM3GEE9Mw">at the UX-Wednesday micro-conference, a round table discussion</a> was devoted entirely to this topic, and the general interest of the Russian audience proved its relevance.  The more well-known successful examples and people with whom you can talk on topical issues of implementation, the faster the domestic market will develop. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IixM3GEE9Mw" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Of course, we do not forget about the <a href="http://styleguides.io/">best and main site-collection of design systems</a> .  But the majority of companies in our compilation work in the Russian-speaking market, and translating component libraries only for getting there is not particularly justified.  For the first version of the site we, first of all, put all the links together.  In the future we will work on the development of the idea - it will become clearer and clearer, it will be possible to compare the progress of companies. <br><br>  <a href="http://eepurl.com/deKCzL">Subscribe to the newsletter</a> to get everything fresh once a month.  And do not be afraid to start - the first step is quite capable of even small companies. <br><br>  <strong><a href="https://principles.design/">Design principles</a></strong> <strong><a href="https://principles.design/"><br></a></strong>  Ben Brignell has put together another powerful collection of design principles that is even larger than the classic Design Principles FTW. <br><br> <a href="https://principles.design/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9c9/78e/bd1/9c978ebd113b461fc1601081d2292bdf.png" alt="Design principles" width="780" height="452"></a> <br><br>  <strong><a href="https://vimeo.com/242899818">Cristobal Castilla &amp; Zack Schiller - Design Systems &amp; Tools at Facebook</a></strong> <strong><a href="https://vimeo.com/242899818"><br></a></strong>  Cristobal Castilla‚Äôs insanely interesting talk about the FIG design system on Facebook.  The story mainly concerns the templates for Sketch and Origami, but it affects the components in the code and the approach to the development of the platform as a whole.  For design tools, a space set of add-ons, interlayers and plug-ins has been written on its own.  In addition to the convenience of organization, this makes it possible to use icons from a single repository with development, to connect data from a personal profile (this is convenient for both prototyping and usability testing).  This is a very, very powerful guideline on how to organize work with designer tools. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://player.vimeo.com/video/242899818" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <strong><a href="https://medium.com/ge-design/creating-cirrus-the-next-generation-predix-design-language-a6068d30a6f7">Creating GE Cirrus - The Next Generation Predix design language</a></strong> <strong><a href="https://medium.com/ge-design/creating-cirrus-the-next-generation-predix-design-language-a6068d30a6f7"><br></a></strong>  Ken Skistimas, head of the GE Predix design system, talks about working on her new generation.
