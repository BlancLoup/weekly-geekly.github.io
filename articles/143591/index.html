Someone was tired of standing, someone silently hated Yota employees for slow service, someone resigned and mentally chose an alternative operator.  Persons such that at the time of posting a famous <a href="">demotivator with a cat</a> .  People puffed, sighed, gazed, but were silent.  Because they knew that if someone was indignant, the crowd would immediately explode, and then for sure nobody would receive the coveted box.  But so want to go home.  Hate and malice have long been hung in the air with a fine suspension, and only a spark was enough for a good explosion.  Therefore, all were silent, tolerated and sad.  But the ‚Äúhappy‚Äù owners of the new modems would know what to expect at home ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  And at home they will be disappointed and emptiness.  The same emptiness that each Yota subscriber felt last month.  When no one called back to the left request for the delivery of a new standard device.  When in the contact center they feed breakfast, and at the service points they tragically report that there are still no mobile routers.  On the <a href="http://www.yota.ru/ru/">official</a> information <a href="http://www.yota.ru/ru/">site</a> - zero.  Not a single notification about the launch or change of the delivery schedule for any available communication channel to the subscriber.  Only a short SMS, stating that another 900 rubles was written off the bank card.  over the next month. <br><br>  For the first time, surprise comes when you don‚Äôt find at least some instructions for a new device: books, pieces of paper, or at least a short text on a package.  What is the Wi-Fi password?  What is WPS, and how to use this button?  The site operator has no answer to these questions.  Using the brute force and scientific method, you select the password to the wireless network of the router: <b>12345678</b> .  This time, the guys didn‚Äôt work out as cunningly as with Yota Many, where the MAC address of the device was used as a password. <br><br>  The second time you are surprised when the contact center phone is not available.  Totally.  Just you can not get through and get into another one-hour queue of subscribers.  And you understand that such sad subscribers like you are hundreds of thousands, and it <a href="http://www.cnews.ru/top/2012/05/10/yota_zapustila_lte_abonenty_v_shoke_488881">will be unreal to</a> get through to the operator‚Äôs technical support line in the coming days.

      For the third time, you are already indignant when an <b>unexpected error</b> occurs when you try to log in to your personal account.  Sadness and longing for half an hour.  And when, hurray, ‚Äúit‚Äù worked, when you register the device you are told: ‚Äúwe cannot register your device yet, you are open to the Internet without restrictions.‚Äù  Checking - of course, "it" does not work.  Any request to any site automatically redirects to this message about disability.  And in the end you are left with a useless white box and without the Internet. <br><br>  ... And people passed by and were very, as a Soviet, interested in the subject of excitement: ‚ÄúWhat are they selling here?‚Äù, ‚ÄúSomething is being played out?‚Äù, ‚ÄúYota what, are they giving away devices for free?‚Äù.  ‚ÄúAha, for free‚Äù - the sad subscribers joked and smiled sadly.  And we would hold out for a couple of days, but stay the night.  And as long as there is no broadband access in our homes, we will quietly connect to our neighbors' WiFi points, sorting through popular password options: 12345678, 87654321, 11111111, 22222222 ... </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/143591/">https://habr.com/ru/post/143591/</a></p>
