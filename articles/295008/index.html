Analysts record exact, complete and consistent requirements, inspired designers create beautiful and user-friendly design, developers write perfect code, testers fight heroically for quality.  But the closer to all this beauty, the more noticeable are the absurd moments that occur in any office, which can damage the psyche of a single IT specialist.  In the struggle for mental health (as well as against burnout, demotivation and surprise at what is happening) there are many ways.  And one of them is to set oneself up in a philosophical way so as not to take what is happening too close to the heart and to treat it without undue nervousness.  The book of fables from the life of submariners Alexander Shot of Alexander Pokrovsky helps in this.  For many years at various places of work, I recommend it to my colleagues. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  About therapeutic effect </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e34/446/da7/e34446da71654a568e050be9ede7e4bf.jpg"><br>  <i>Console general systems "Molybdenum".</i>  <i>Photo <a href="http://i-legal-alien.livejournal.com/">Legal Alien</a></i> <br><br>  Like any sophisticated technology, a nuclear submarine must drown right at the pier.  Seriously.  I pressed at the wrong time or the wrong button on this terrible remote, and hello.  And the fact that submarines sink, float, go to autonomous systems and even carry out shooting practice is the merit of the people who set this ‚Äúiron‚Äù in motion.  And besides the direct participation in the life of the submarine, these people are engaged in a mass of interesting things - they go in order, dig ditches, wipe with a damp cloth and eliminate comments.  You read the story, aphoristically expressing the phrase ‚Äúuntil we sing <i>well</i> from the cold, we don‚Äôt leave,‚Äù and feel better immediately.  Just think that this feast of colors is happening with technically educated and intelligent people (do not forget about the terrible console), and it becomes quite good.

      In general, if desired, you can spend a lot of parallels.  Are you not inspired by Eychary?  Read about zampolitov.  In glorious Soviet times, the political leaders could not know the structure of the submarine, but they demanded summaries of the original sources of Marxism-Leninism from the entire crew.  And they also organized the most interesting entertainment events like matinees, lyrical charades or listening to the voices of the classics.  Are bosses not genius enough?  We read about the naval authorities (if not enough, you can add regular inspectors) and it becomes good.  Think about the fact that, unlike a submariner, to change jobs, an IT specialist does not need to be translated for months and years, and in general it becomes good.  Just great!  Do not cause ecstasy new design, which like two peas in a pod like last?  And you could send to dig a ditch.  Or, for example, the remarkable invention of ‚Äúdolboledizm‚Äù, when the whole friendly team goes to hammer ice to concrete.  Shovels should not stand idle!  Cool friendly feelings for colleagues?  They eagerly imagined that with these colleagues you spend 50-90 days in one compartment and rest in one cabin, and life is beautiful again.  And considering that at home rat fleas from ventilation are not raining on us (well, as a rule), it is doubly beautiful! <br><br><h4>  About wisdom </h4><br>  In addition to the therapeutic effect of awareness, how well we live, the book is truly a treasure trove of wisdom.  Many quotes worthy of cast in granite and placed on the walls of offices: <br><br><blockquote>  Linden should be lime, not oak. </blockquote><br><blockquote>  Understand, the case can stand, but the magazine should go ... </blockquote><br><blockquote>  What is navy laughter?  This is when you missed. </blockquote><br><blockquote>  Mean so!  To draw!  Restore by pouring!  Abnormal paths destroy!  Pit zaschebenit!  Why get gravel!  The lake is put on granite shores.  I assign you the senior over this disgrace.  No fever.  We'll do it in the morning. <br>  Three hours later, when you had already drawn: <br>  - So!  Everything!  Firewood in the original!  Managed to fight back: now it is not our object. </blockquote><br><blockquote>  My God, how much is not done ... how much is not done ... and how much remains to be done ... </blockquote><br><blockquote>  And now they are writing off from the seafarers in two articles: destructive spots and perforation of the uterus. </blockquote><br>  And the most important one: <br><blockquote>  Service in the Navy can not be taken seriously, otherwise you will go crazy. </blockquote></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/295008/">https://habr.com/ru/post/295008/</a></p>
