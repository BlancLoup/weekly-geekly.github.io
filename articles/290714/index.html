Big data is big data.  They will help everyone, and in general, because of them, everything will change and complete communism will come. <br><br>  But there is another side to the emergence and distribution of big data.  Big data is primarily data.  The marketing delights of the information sector are trying to present big data in a strictly defined way, as discrete information bits that do not go into physical measurement and judgment.  In fact, big data is still data with inherent properties, and they need storage locations. <br><br>  ‚ÄúData tsunami‚Äù is a term by which everyone feels like it is to describe the mass of data that begins to overwhelm our digital world.  This situation is a bit dramatic, but not as much as many think.  Although this does not mean that it can be neglected.  Today, many companies have data storage solutions, but there is one ‚ÄúBUT‚Äù, it was all before the appearance and distribution of big data.  Now most of these decisions have lost their relevance.  We have entered a world where even an egg tray in a refrigerator can generate data.  How to prepare your company for a digital tsunami?

      Here are three steps that can help resolve pep problems. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Infrastructure </h4><br>  The most pressing (and obvious) problem is the problem of infrastructure.  Each company must make sure that it has both the capacity to store data and the necessary and sufficient bandwidth to access the data. <br><br>  The worst option could be when the company stores data locally.  Even with backups, it is completely incomprehensible how to solve the problem of continuous data flow and increasing the number of servers. <br><br>  Many companies that do not lose touch with reality have long been looking towards cloud technologies to solve this problem.  At the moment, there are many similar solutions that make it easy to scale storage systems.  Storing data in the cloud also helps to solve the infrastructure problem seamlessly and transparently for the end user. <br><br><h4>  Strategy </h4><br>  Despite the virtually infinite possibilities of scaling clouds, the ‚Äútsunami of data‚Äù will reveal one big strategic question: how much data do you want to save, and for how long? <br><br>  There is data that you need to save forever.  There are those whose action is temporary.  Obviously, the priority of data in different companies will be different.  The impending tsunami makes it clear that the task of data control comes to the forefront.  Prioritization, retention timeframe, expiration, deletion and reservation.  Everything is like in childhood: it is much easier to keep a room clean - maintaining order, rather than directing it once a month.  The accumulation of large amounts of data without a strategy of further control can lead to an irrational use of current opportunities and excessive expenditure of funds. <br><br><h4>  Politics </h4><br>  Data security on this wave reveals even more serious problems.  Compared to them, the logistical problem of storage and transportation may seem completely insignificant.  If a company collects customer data, increasing data flow increases the risk of uncontrolled data manipulation and compromise.  Therefore, when building infrastructure and strategic planning, policies with respect to employees, users and all interested parties are absolutely important. <br><br>  Many bona fide and not so good companies decided to hide the new policies deeply in the conditions of service provision and customer agreements.  However, updating the policy can be an excellent step in building trust with customers.  The transparency of the service will give an indication of the company's readiness for the coming digital storm. <br><br>  Companies will face unique problems for which there are no ready-made boxed solutions.  In this regard, each of the steps described will require proper and timely planning.  Knowing about the upcoming, any interested business can develop a roadmap to resolve future problems and what follows them.  May the force be with you! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/290714/">https://habr.com/ru/post/290714/</a></p>
