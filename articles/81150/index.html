  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Categories of gamers and what gives them their hobbies?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Be healthy, Habrachelovek! <br>  Inspired by the reading of the topic <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/games/79916/">"Generations of gamers"</a> by the author of a respected <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/rewiaca/" class="user_link">rewiaca</a> .  Therefore, I decided to write my extended answer, which will be too great for comment. <br><br><h2>  Who are you, gamer? </h2><br>  So that your idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhat I want to say does not diverge from what I was trying to write, I want to briefly define some mass categories of gamers. <br><ul><li>  Children (up to 13) </li><li>  Teenagers (from 13 to 18) </li><li>  Youth (from 18 to 27) </li><li>  Adults </li></ul><br>  I hasten to note that I exaggerated.  Now let's try to answer the sacramental question ‚ÄúWhy do people play games?  What does it give them? ‚Äù <br>  With your permission, in more detail I will describe my versions of answers in a random order. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Adults </h3><br>  I start with this category, because everything in it is completely logical and justified. <br>  Often adults, and sometimes even wealthy, people play in the game for the banal self-gratification, which in <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/games/79916/">Generations of Gamers</a> was called the pleasure of the process itself.  There is absolutely nothing to condemn this category of people.  Imagine a guy of whom a million: <br>  An adult, say 40-50 years.  For simplicity of perception let's call him Sergey. <br>  Sergey is a specialist in his field, he achieved everything in his life through his hard work.  While still a student, he was fond of computer science, but at some certain point he decided for himself that he would play enough at the weekend, but for the time being it was worth learning.  And Sergey with all his stubbornness develops in his chosen field of activity, which concerns the computer absolutely indirectly.  He graduates from the university, albeit without much difference, but in his hands is a diploma in which a specialist is written in dark color according to light. <br>  But our hero is well aware that he can only be considered a specialist when he has experience.  And suddenly luck turns to him, in a prestigious company (factory / factory / office / tent on the market) a position is vacated, which Sergey can take.  And he confidently proceeds to work.  The work schedule includes a well-deserved piece of the day for rest and weekends.  Sergey meets a beautiful girl, who gradually falls in love and they play a wedding.  After some time, they have children, and at work Sergey earns money and precious experience, which allows him to go up the career ladder and arrange the welfare of his family. <br>  One day, he remembers his former love of computer games and buys one of the new products.  Now, an hour or two after a hard day‚Äôs work, Sergey spends playing games, while not depriving any attention of either his wife or children. <br>  What give him the game?  Nothing, no prospects and nothing like that.  But he gets pleasure from the process and relaxes after a day‚Äôs work by driving expensive cars, shooting non-existent creatures, solving other people's riddles ... <br>  He cannot be condemned, he cannot be accused of killing his time.

    <h3>  Children </h3><br>  It is now most children are born in families where there is already a computer, and sometimes not one.  It is now they are growing and developing, looking at how their parents spend their time at the computer.  At a fairly early age, they learn to play and are addicted to computer games. <br>  Further, a certain part of the time the development of children depends on the consciousness of the parents.  If the parent will be right only ‚Äúunder the child‚Äù to pick up games that will help and interest him, and not in every way harm his psyche. <br>  What does it give to children?  Playing educational games or, let's say, smart games, including the same quests with cunning riddles, the child receives developmental benefits.  He also gets certain basic computer skills, because at some point his father or mother get tired of installing a child to play and he has to do it himself.  In the modern world, PC skills will not be superfluous and it‚Äôs not for me, Khabracheloveki, to talk about it. <br><br><h3>  Teenagers and young people </h3><br>  I decided to combine the details of these two categories, because I see in them a lot in common.  But, I hasten to clarify that every year this general more and more becomes different. <br>  Playing teens are divided into two types.  Some are drawn only in games and this does not lead to anything, because they are not interested in going further games.  They are enough 80 levela, buffers in the city and party in order to be proud of themselves. <br>  Another kind of playing games, boils the brain.  Looks like it is done and wants to do the same, and even better.  Most of them in the end do not become the creators of games, but acquire all sorts of specialties in the field of information technology. <br>  It is the above that is common between categories.  And this is only common because today there are still people who are not lucky to get their first computer at school age and they have to go through all stages from the player to the proud title of IT specialist a little later.  But soon the situation will change in chronological terms, and I want to believe that for the better. <br><br>  Personally, in the current computer science teacher, I have to deal with interesting teenagers who create an unpleasant picture of the future in front of me.  At the age of 14‚Äì16, all students are obsessed with computer games.  Moreover, with the active development of providers, most of these games are multiplayer online games, which teenagers spend from 6 to 12 hours a day.  At the same time, most of them with the included star are trying to stop me from posting to them an absolutely imperfect, but obligatory computer science program with shouts ‚Äúthat you are, we are not noobs, we all know in camps‚Äù.  When you give them a primitive practical work in a word processor, almost everything, with a few exceptions, is already lost. <br>  Educational conversations about the preciousness of time and meaning in its spending on computer games do not bring results. <br>  During the second year of work, I worked with more than three hundred students, of whom I managed to meet 4 more or less promising in the field of IT.  Quick calculations show that this is literally 1%, which in the digital age cannot be considered an acceptable indicator. <br><br>  My personal answer to the question of what the games give to teenagers and young people is divided into two answers.  One they bring inspiration to self-development in computer-computer areas, the other - the games do not give anything, but only take time, although if you plunge deeper, by definition they don‚Äôt need it. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/81150/">https://habr.com/ru/post/81150/</a></p>
