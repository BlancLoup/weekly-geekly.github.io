However, there are some subscribers for whom the guaranteed level of Internet connection is not so critical.  We decided that, nevertheless, you should have a choice and at the initial stage our ‚Äúlimited‚Äù offer can sometimes be useful. <br><br>  This post will tell you about the advantages and disadvantages of renting servers with 100TB of traffic.  It will explain the origin of such a low price for these servers and will tell in what cases it is advisable to use them, and in which it is better to refrain from use.  We once again urge to use only guaranteed inclusions, in order to avoid misunderstandings.  All other options of services, such as <a href="http://ua-hosting.com.ua/nl-servers.html">servers with 100TB of traffic from $ 120 are</a> provided ‚Äúas is‚Äù and at any time their provision is not guaranteed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d4d/846/bbd/d4d846bbdfcf8fb643064a8fad8570c7.jpg"><a name="habracut"></a>

      It's no secret that a guaranteed channel on the Internet costs quite a lot of money.  The price is determined by the number and level of operators from which the channel is purchased, by the connectivity, and also by what% of the traffic goes to exchange points that have their own ‚Äúlow-cost‚Äù inclusion.  Even with the purchase of hundreds of gigabits from different operators - it is rarely possible to lower the price below 500 euro / gigabit.  Selling a warranty is cheaper, data centers rely on the fact that not everyone will use their inclusions 100% of the time and expand the overall channel as needed.  Also, sometimes a certain fee for traffic is taken not only from subscribers, but also from peering providers who are interested in exchanging traffic with the data center, but for this, the data center should be a good generator of traffic on their network. <br><br>  Proceeding from this, if you see the price of a gigabit channel much lower than 500 euros, and even with the server, you should know - you are being cheated. <br><br>  Just over 2 years ago, the EvoSwitch data center significantly expanded its external channels.  Well, like any decent operator who has a lot of band idle, he decided to organize an auction of unheard of generosity to compensate for losses from idle time and attract new customers, especially since similar offers were already on the market of low-cost airlines, but with similar quality for so little money - no one had anything like it.  The calculation was mainly made on ‚ÄúWestern‚Äù users, who often do not know how to count how much traffic they need and who in most cases never consume their 100TB and are very well attracted to large numbers, in other words to ‚Äúfair consumption‚Äù. <br><br>  When ‚Äúour‚Äù people came to the data center with their streaming projects (online video, music / radio online, etc.), CDN (including proxy / vpn), it became obvious that fair consumption for 100TB servers among Slavic population is not accepted, all give as much as possible and cheaper.  And everyone wants to use the service to the maximum.  And God forbid the owners of these projects to overpay $ 100, despite earning many times more ... As a result, already after 3 months after announcing the service, the excess reserve of channels was rapidly decreasing and it became obvious that the service did not pay for itself. <br><br>  The data center due to such "honest" users decided to introduce a number of restrictions.  According to which, <b>when renting a server with a traffic limit of 100TB, you agree to the following conditions</b> : <br><br>  - do not use the server for streaming or CDN without the prior consent of the data center (can be provided in very rare cases, which are not disclosed); <br>  - 100 TB servers - a limited and temporary offer, you may be denied the further provision of the service unilaterally without giving a reason with the notification 14 days before the suspension of the provision of the service; <br>  - use the provided amount of traffic honestly, without abrupt peaks of consumption, evenly during the month (in other words, it is impossible to use more than 3.3 TB per day, it is not difficult to calculate that for the consumption of such traffic the average channel load should be no more than 330 Mbit / s) . <br><br>  <b>In case of violation of the conditions, the following measures can be applied:</b> <br><br>  - server port speed limit; <br>  - the change in the price of the leased 100TB server to the market value of the consumed band; <br>  - suspension or termination of the offender server without returning money to the client. <br><br>  Also, the data center created some software systems that can automatically detect such violations.  Therefore, it is highly recommended to follow the rules if you want to use servers of the 100TB series. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/fd1/99a/8dd/fd199a8dde2b94a772f2ab353877ca41.jpg"><br><br><h4>  For whom and for what purpose can this offer be useful? </h4><br>  - to visited portals that are not enough 100 Mb / s to the server, but the channel would be enough 150-300 Mb / s, if you pay for guaranteed gigabit is expensive and you need to save; <br>  - for backup servers, if you have a lot of servers from which you need to perform backups quickly and efficiently (in order not to violate the policy, we recommend performing such operations outside of business time, or restrict copying flow on your own); <br>  - file archives (if you have a file-sharing project and the load can be evenly distributed over the inventory - this is an offer for you, however remember that streaming is prohibited and there should be no sudden surges of consumption). <br><br>  It is very important to adhere to an honest policy of traffic consumption, since in case of significant exceedances, the channel in the data center cabinet cannot expand.  You can cause the degradation of the service for other subscribers and you will simply be blocked in order to prevent it.  In case of repeated violation, unlocking will be impossible. <br><br>  The service is essentially a controlled shared-inclusion, it is for this reason that streaming is prohibited.  For owners of such online video portals, it is sometimes very difficult to control consumption, besides on such ‚Äú100TB - switching on‚Äù the guaranteed speed per stream may not be provided, which is sometimes critical for HD-video online and even for regular video. <br><br>  Order servers from the 100TB series on our website: <br><br>  <a href="http://ua-hosting.com.ua/nl-servers.html">http://ua-hosting.com.ua/nl-servers.html</a> <br><br>  Intel Dual-Core G6950 / 4GB DDR3 / 2x250GB SATA2 / 1Gbps 100TB - $ 120 <br>  Intel Xeon E3-1230 / 8GB DDR3 / 2x500GB SATA2 / 1Gbps 100TB - $ 150 <br>  2x Intel Quad-Core Xeon E5620 / 8GB DDR3 / 4x1TB SATA2 / 1Gbps 100TB - $ 199 <br>  2 x Intel Hexa-Core Xeon E5645 / 8GB DDR3 / 4x1TB SATA2 / 1Gbps 100TB - $ 259 <br>  2 x Intel Hexa-Core Xeon E5-2420 / 8GB DDR3 / 4x1TB SATA2 / 1Gbps 100TB - $ 339 <br>  2 x Intel Hexa-Core Xeon E5-2620 / 16GB DDR3 / 4x1TB SATA2 / 1Gbps 100TB - $ 429 <br>  2 x Intel Octa-Core Xeon E5-2650 / 8GB DDR3 / 4x1TB SATA2 / 1Gbps 100TB - $ 499 <br>  Intel Quad Core Xeon L5410 / 8GB DDR2 / 24x1TB SATA2 / 1Gbps 100TB - $ 390 <br><br>  <i>Upgrades of disks and memory are available starting with configuration E3-1230!</i>  <i>The deadline for the provision of servers is 1-5 business days.</i>  <i>If the upgrade is not ordered, there is a chance to get an ‚Äúautomatic‚Äù server within half an hour after ordering!</i> <br><br>  Proceeding from the low price of the servers of the 100TB series, the data center still hopes that you will not consume all of the included traffic per month;  Previously, the fines were much higher, but the data center went to a meeting and lowered them, as sometimes the overruns did not happen deliberately.  Nevertheless, the excess of traffic per 100TB will cost you $ 7,500, so tightly control your consumption, or purchase a guaranteed inclusion that will be much cheaper and where there will not be any restrictions. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/183438/">https://habr.com/ru/post/183438/</a></p>
