    <a name="habracut"></a>  At the moment, Google is actively engaged in the study of <a href="http://www.byyd.me/ru/blog/2015/06/micromoments/">"micro-moments"</a> related to the technology of using mobile devices.  And this interest of the main sharks of the IT market is easy to explain: each of us spends on average about 120 minutes to ‚Äúcommunicate‚Äù with the smartphone.  However, live communication is given only 12 minutes of the total amount of time.  The rest is spent on surfing in the ‚Äúbig web‚Äù, social networks, games, listening to music, checking electronic mailboxes ... <br>  You might be surprised, but the average user is used to checking news on his smartphone every 6 minutes.  At the same time, it will be no less interesting information that every day about 1.5 million Android devices are activated on the planet.  And this is about 4 times the number, which reflects the global birth rate of children. <br><br>  So, the vice-president of Google, Sridhar Ramaswami, believes that all the attention of consumers, riveted on smartphones, is a gold mine for marketers.  Especially when it comes to programmatic space, which makes advertisers all over the world keep up with the times. <br><br>  Of course, Google is not the only company that is trying to better understand these new consumer behavior patterns.  Similar research is also conducted by: The American non-state company The Pew Research Center, which studies social issues, demographic trends and public opinion;  Leading international company The Boston Consulting Group, specializing in management consulting;  Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) and Mobile Marketing Association.  All of the above organizations have recently published research that could benefit marketers who are in search of new retargeting strategies and ideas in the field of smartphone-creative. <br><br>  Below we present to your attention five studies with which all advertisers who have relied on algorithmic advertising purchases should be familiarized. <br><br>  <b>MOBILE PROGRAMMATIC PLAYBOOK</b> <br><br>  In March 2015, IAB released its study ‚ÄúMobile Programmatic Playbook‚Äù, which describes how smoothly all components of a mobile program program should work in order to achieve better results.  If you need to refresh your memory and remember the most successful practices of measuring performance or recall the creatives that have the greatest impact on consumers, then this guide is for you. <br><br>  There are four main types of ad units on the mobile programmatic market, namely, banners, ‚Äúin-built advertising‚Äù * (interstitials), video and native advertising.  In this case, the most common today is banner advertising, which accounts for 70% of all hits. <br>  If we compare these formats with the usual "display card", then: <br>  Conversion rate of "implemented advertising" is 2 times higher <br>  The conversion rate of "natural advertising" is 4 times higher <br>  CTR "implemented advertising" 1.5 times higher <br>  CTR native advertising 1.2 times higher <br><br>  * "Injected" advertisements appear in the browser window (not necessarily the full size of the window) when switching from one page to another, while loading.  - IAB <br><br>  <b>ADDING DATA, BOOSTING IMPACT</b> <br><br>  The 11-page report of the Boston Consulting Group ‚ÄúAdding Data, Increasing Impact‚Äù is a successful attempt to shed light on the possibilities of digital advertising, which marketers may have missed.  Here you will find recommendations on how to improve engagement with innovative behavioral targeting techniques. <br><br>  Many advertisers are not interested in innovation, because they lose a unique opportunity to improve the effectiveness of advertising campaigns.  Unlike traditional RK, new technology targeting allows you to: by 32% more effective CPA-model, by 70% lower CPC and CPV, and also by 200% increase in the number of clicks and views of advertisements. <br><br>  <b>US SMARTPHONE USE IN 2015</b> <br><br>  The Pew Research Center did an excellent job providing statistics on how consumers of all ages use their smartphones.  This also applies to those cases where consumers intend to quickly and easily solve a particular problem.  We are talking about all the same "micro moments", which are laid out on Google shelves. <br><br>  62% of smartphone owners use a phone to check health information <br>  57% use their smartphone for online banking <br>  44% - for viewing real estate <br>  43% - to search for information about work <br>  40% - to view information about public services <br>  30% - for searching educational content <br>  18% - to apply for a job <br><br>  <b>APP VS.</b>  <b>WEB FOR SURVEYS OF SMARTPHONE USERS</b> <br><br>  The same Pew Research Center explains the difference in behavior of consumers using mobile applications and web browsers.  It is noteworthy that the respondents were asked to talk about the use of mobile devices an hour before taking part in the survey. <br><br>  An hour before the survey, the overwhelming majority (80%) of respondents used their mobile phones, 7% used a tablet and 14% used a desktop or laptop. <br><br>  Smart Mobile Cross Marketing Effectiveness Report <br><br>  Will you believe that during a RK such a large company like AT &amp; T, for every dollar spent on mobile advertising, 3 consumers were involved, and the TV channel could only attract 1.5 consumers for every dollar?  The report of the Mobile Marketing Association details how AT &amp; T, Coca-Cola, Walmart and MasterCard benefit from an increase in mobile budget. <br><br>  Coca-Cola.  After evaluating the effectiveness of each individual channel, it turned out that the mobile provides 25% higher top of mind awareness (the first brand that consumers remember when they mention the product category) and sales increase by 6%.  And this is with a 5% share allocated for mobile advertising from the general budget of the Republic of Kazakhstan. <br>  Walmart.  Only 7% of the budget allocated to Kazakhstan was spent on the mobile.  At the same time, mobile advertising turned out to be much more effective than television, having seriously affected the intention of consumers to make a purchase. <br><br> <a href="http://www.byyd.me/ru/register/%3Futm_source%3Dmegamozg%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3Dcontent_marketing"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/041/3c5/29a/0413c529a1424210a02b160e54a40e80.png"></a> <br><br>  <a href="http://www.byyd.me/ru/%3Futm_source%3Dmegamozg">BYYD ‚Ä¢ Mobile Advertising Platform</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/295904/">https://habr.com/ru/post/295904/</a></p>
