  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Electron and the decline of native applications</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><p>  <a href="https://twitter.com/SwiftOnSecurity/status/1069776335336292352">SwiftOnSecurity writes</a> on the recent transition to Chromium as a Windows rendering engine: </p><br><blockquote>  It's not just about Chrome, it's also about ElectronJS.  Microsoft thinks EdgeHTML cannot achieve full parity in functionality with Chromium to replace it in Electron applications.  Duplication of the Electron engine in each program becomes a significant performance problem.  Instead, they want one copy of Electron along with their add-ons. <br><br>  Electron is a cancer that kills both macOS and Windows as it spreads.  Microsoft should offer it a replacement with native optimizations to improve performance and resource utilization. </blockquote><p>  I do not quite share their pessimism about native applications, but Electron is without a doubt the scourge of the platform.  I think the Mac will offer more resistance than Windows, because the Mac platform attracts more caring people.  But still, I'm worried. </p><a name="habracut"></a><br><p>  In a sense, the worst thing that ever happened to a Mac was his sudden rise in popularity ten years ago.  In theory, this should be good news for the platform - more users means more attention from developers.  The more Mac users, the more we will see Mac applications.  The problem is that users who are really worried about native applications, that is, they notice violations of the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/macos/">HIG</a> in the interfaces, are concerned about performance and that the applications on the Mac are <em>correct</em> , are already sitting on the Mac.  Many new users either didn‚Äôt know or didn‚Äôt care about what makes Mac applications good. </p><br><p>  At the same time there have always been bad applications.  But they rarely reached any level of popularity because Mac users collectively rejected them.  A canonical example is Microsoft Word 6.0.  Word 5 for Mac was a favorite of users and a confident resident of the Mac platform.  Word 6 was a cross-platform monster.  Mac users rejected it, and their reaction provoked changes to Microsoft - on top of their greatness in the mid-90s, they completely rethought the strategy of working with Macs and created a separate line of business dedicated to developing for Mac.  <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/rick_schaut/2004/02/26/mac-word-6-0/">Rick Schautt from Microsoft described this story amazingly in 2004</a> : </p><br><blockquote>  Ok, Mac Word 6.0 was huge and slow relative to the power of computers of those times, but this was not the reason why Mac Word 6.0 turned out to be a crap product, at least not directly. <br>  [...] <br>  Moreover, while people complained about performance, we heard the most discontent about the fact that Mac Word 6.0 was not ‚ÄúMac-like‚Äù.  So we spent a lot of time to figure out exactly what people mean by talking about ‚ÄúMac-like‚Äù.  We launched a focus group.  Some of us hang out in Usenet communities.  We talked with program reviewers and with our friends who used the product.  It turned out that ‚ÄúMac-like‚Äù meant Mac Word 5.0. <br><br>  We spent a lot of time to solve all the technical problems of Mac Word 6.0, but we failed in creating a UI that would work as Word 5.0. <br>  [...] <br>  Another thing that we found out as a result of understanding the essence of ‚ÄúMac-like‚Äù was that we could not implement it correctly if Office remained a single product from which both versions would be built, under Mac and under Windows.  The fact that the implementation of ‚ÄúMac-like‚Äù turned out to be a problem meant that there are fundamental differences between the Win Word and Mac Word markets.  If we wanted to understand both markets, then our Win and Mac products should have separate marketing and product management.  The lessons that we learned from Mac Word 6.0 are one of the reasons why a separate direction for Mac exists now. </blockquote><p>  I fundamentally disagree with one aspect: users saw the embodiment of Mac-like not in the form of Word 5 as such - in fact, Word 5 just followed the rules of the Mac in its design.  Word 6 was rejected not because of its unusualness, but because it literally looked the opposite of Mac-like.  It looked and worked exactly like Word for Windows. </p><br><p>  How far from Mac-like was Word 6, but even it was closer than the current Google Docs, open in Chrome.  Google Docs is an anti-mac text editor running inside an <a href="https://twitter.com/gruber/status/1062419383350448128">even more anti-mac web browser</a> .  The fact that Mac users were strongly rejected as anti-Mac in 1996 was better than what Mac users happily endure today.  Programs no longer need to look native to a Mac in order to achieve success on it today.  This is a tragedy. </p><br><p>  Even Apple itself is already releasing Mac applications with blatant manifestations of anti-Mac.  ‚ÄúMarzipan‚Äù apps on MacOS 10.14 Mojave - News, Home, Stocks, Voice Memos are <a href="http://benjaminmayo.co.uk/marzipan">terribly bad apps</a> .  They are bad both in functional terms and in the foreign sensation of design.  I honestly do not understand how Apple decided that it would be normal to release such applications. </p><br><p>  Another example would be the new App Store application on Mojave.  It certainly looks beautiful, but a <a href="https://twitter.com/gruber/status/1070339868184797184">few days ago I noticed that it does not support the Page Down and Page Up keys to scroll</a> (as well as Home and End to go to the beginning or end) <em>in any</em> of its screens. </p><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Small note</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><p>  After I wrote about this on Twitter, several people responded that the non-working keys should not be a surprise, because modern Apple keyboards do not have them.  First of all, this is incorrect - they are on the large Magic Keyboard.  But even if you have a MacBook or just a little keyboard, you can get these buttons using Fn.  Fn ‚Üì = Page Down;  Fn ‚Üë = Page Up;  Fn ‚Üê = Home;  Fn ‚Üí = End.  Use! </p></div></div><br><p>  Open the page and click Page Down, but instead of scrolling it just beeps.  The only way to scroll the page is with a mouse or trackpad.  And this application from Apple, used by almost everyone.  Even applications on Marzipan support these keys, because this functionality, like other standard behavior, is obtained free of charge with the corresponding development framework.  The Mojave version of the App Store must be doing something <a href="https://twitter.com/lapcatsoftware/status/1070346157442981890">completely strange</a> for these keys to stop working. </p><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Small note</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><p> While I turned on the <strong>kiddies</strong> mode to the full <strong>, get out of my lawn</strong> , let me mention one more situation with Mojave, which is exactly the work of young Apple developers.  The File ‚Üí Show Original command in Finder had an ‚åòR hotkey since I think System 6. (Select an alisas or symlink, and this command will show you the source file).  File ‚Üí Make Alias ‚Äã‚Äãwas ‚åòL.  In Mojave, R was inexplicable to be reassigned to the right and ‚åòL to the left.  (It looks like they are invisible elements of the Edit menu? They are not in the list of elements, but the Edit button is highlighted when you press these keys.) The hot key for creating an alisace is now ‚å§‚åòA, and the original display is A.  The new combinations themselves are not as bad as it seems to me, but they were incredibly long-established combinations to change them so easily.  Moreover, the new buttons do not even coincide with those in Photos, where they are given as ‚åòR - counterclockwise and ‚å•‚åòR - clockwise.  Keyboard shortcuts in Photos, where spinning in the other direction is an option with the Option modifier () instead of using a completely different key, it seems to me more native for Mac.  Preview, on the other hand, uses the names "Rotate Left" and "Rotate Right" and the same combinations of ‚åòL and ‚å•‚åòR as the Finder in Mojave.  I give up. </p></div></div><br><p>  The App Store app for Mojave definitely does not use Electron.  But the problem with Electron applications is not in him, but in reducing user demand for well-made native Mac applications.  And it scares.  The biggest threat to the Mac is not the iPad, not the Chromebook or Windows 2-in-1 tablets, but apathy towards what made the Mac applications so wonderful.  As I <a href="https://twitter.com/gruber/status/1070349550387380225">tweeted about the Page Down / Up situation</a> : </p><br><blockquote>  Such situations for us are like canaries in a coal mine with respect to the state of the Mac platform.  Even if Apple doesn‚Äôt follow the basic rules - such as Page Up / Down support, things that should work in interfaces right out of the box - how can we expect this from other developers? </blockquote><p>  The new App Store app definitely looks better.  But developers at Apple and other companies need to know the <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2007/01/23/how-it-works">design, and how it works</a> . </p></div>
