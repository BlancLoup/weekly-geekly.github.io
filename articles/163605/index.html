    <ul><li>  Official sales of Apple TV in Russia <a href="http://gamersweb.ru/news/22556/">will start</a> this week.  It is unlikely that someone was looking forward to it, but still nice.  The price of the device will be about 5000 rubles. </li><li>  Each of us knows the Safari web browser, but who would have thought that the name for it was invented for more than a year?  As soon as they didn‚Äôt want to <a href="http://gamersweb.ru/news/safari-mog-byi-nazyivatsya-freedom/">call</a> their creation in Apple!  The web browser almost even called Freedom, in honor of the release from IE, but, by rare coincidence, Jobs‚Äôs option was rejected. </li><li>  Users of Android and iOS devices constantly argue about whose devices are more popular and which ones they buy more often.  Time will tell who is the most desirable for ordinary users, but in small and medium businesses they <a href="http://gamersweb.ru/news/malyiy-i-sredniy-biznes-predpochitaet-smartfonyi-i-planshetyi-apple/">choose</a> iPhones and iPads. </li><li>  A final <a href="http://gamersweb.ru/news/vyineseno-okonchatelnoe-reshenie-po-iskam-motorola-k-apple/">decision was made</a> on Motorola claims against Apple.  In a nutshell: nothing happened.  Motorola remained <s>at the broken trough</s> with its damage of 12.5 billion dollars alone and not needed by anyone. </li><li>  The XXI century is already in the yard, more precisely, we wanted to say that everyone is already walking with the iPhone 5, but this is not a reason to forget about the past: Apple finally <a href="http://gamersweb.ru/news/apple-poluchila-patent-na-pervyiy-iphone/">received a</a> patent for the very first iPhone.  Apparently, this is necessary in order if someone (as they are called in these of your Internet sites: ‚Äúslolop‚Äù?) Wants to copy it. </li><li>  It turns out that Tim Cook, according to Time magazine, <a href="http://gamersweb.ru/news/tim-kuk-mozhet-stat-chelovekom-goda-2012-po-versii-time/">could become the</a> man of the year.  He was also included in the list of favorites.  But, unfortunately, it somehow turned out that the man of 2012 was Barack Obama.  Deserved or not?  It is up to you. </li><li>  Kodak has no choice but to <a href="http://gamersweb.ru/news/kodak-pyitaetsya-vyibratsya-iz-dolgovoy-yamyi-za-schet-svoih-patentov/">sell</a> its patents.  What for?  With the money raised, the company will be able to pay off its debts and reorganize its business.  Among the potential buyers is a company from Cupertino.  I wonder how she will use such acquisitions?  And what is even more interesting: against whom? </li><li>  iOS under version 6.0.2 has become <a href="http://gamersweb.ru/news/ios-6-0-2-stala-dostupna-dlya-skachivaniya/">available</a> for download, but only happy owners of iPhone 5 and iPad mini will be able to upgrade.  Although perhaps it is for the better?  It seems that the owners of older "apple" gadgets have no problems with the software? </li></ul><br><br><h4>  Games, games and more games </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/eb6/754/c72/eb6754c721e002e2b7824a7a346eb0a7.jpg"><br><br><ul><li>  Blizzard has <a href="http://gamersweb.ru/news/blizzard-obyavila-chiteram-ocherednuyu-voynu/">declared</a> another war cheaters.  In the popular game Diablo 3, several thousand player accounts were blocked.  The reason for such extreme measures was the use of bots and various technical gaps in the gaming system.  And rightly so, Blizzard! </li><li>  Studio Electronic Arts is <a href="http://gamersweb.ru/news/novyiy-addon-dlya-battlefield-3-reliz-uzhe-v-marte-2013/">developing an</a> addon to the online shooter Battlefield 3. It‚Äôs not too long to wait for the add-on: according to the developers, it will be released in March 2013, that is, there are literally three months to wait. </li><li>  In the spring of 2013, the <a href="http://gamersweb.ru/news/star-trek-the-video-game-zhdem-s-neterpeniem/">release of the</a> film - Star Trek Into Darkness.  Of course, this picture could not do without the accompanying game.  The project of the Paramount Digital Entertainment studio is a game based on the movie called Star Trek: The Video Game, its release is scheduled for April 23, 2013. </li><li>  New Year is a time not only for Christmas trees, champagne and tangerines, but also various discounts and sales.  So, prepare your money and meet: the <a href="http://gamersweb.ru/blogs/kupi-slona-rasprodazha-v-steam-spetsvyipusk/">Christmas sale on Steam</a> has already begun! </li><li>  The major game publisher THQ <a href="http://gamersweb.ru/news/krupnoe-igrovoe-izdatelstvo-thq-bankrot/">is</a> on the verge of bankruptcy (and this is putting it mildly!).  As it became known today, the company entered into a purchase and sale agreement with the buyer for the purchase of all the company's assets, which include four studios and all the games that are in development: Metro: Last Light, Homefront 2, Company of Heroes 2 and others. </li><li>  Creative Assembly - a studio that creates the best historical strategies in the gaming market, <a href="http://gamersweb.ru/news/22808/">presented</a> Carthage to gamers, the second faction that will be available to players of Total War: Rome II. </li><li>  Irrational Games <a href="http://gamersweb.ru/news/pervyie-5-minut-bioshock-infinite-uzhe-v-seti/">put</a> a new video teaser game Bioshock Infinite on the Web. The video lasts five minutes - during this time you will see the very beginning of the game: Detective Booker DeWitt starts investigating the mystery of the flying city of Colombia. </li></ul><br><br><h4>  Glands </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/388/d28/212/388d28212f2a870518523c8fda052138.jpg"><br><br><ul><li>  The company Polaroid is <a href="http://gamersweb.ru/news/polaroid-rabotaet-nad-universalnyim-ustroystvom-na-baze-android-4-0/">working</a> on a universal device (camera 100 in 1?) <a href="http://gamersweb.ru/news/polaroid-rabotaet-nad-universalnyim-ustroystvom-na-baze-android-4-0/">Running the</a> Android operating system.  Interestingly, was their Galaxy Camera so inspired? </li><li>  The Finnish company Nokia decided to focus its attention on the <a href="http://gamersweb.ru/news/nokia-uluchshaet-kameru-dlya-lumia-920/">camera of</a> its flagship Lumia 920. To be more precise, they decided to start improving the camera itself.  It turns out that she is not so cool as they said?  Or is it just that perfection has no limits? </li><li>  HTC missed their <a href="http://gamersweb.ru/news/rekord-htc-ne-sostoitsya/">chance</a> to record.  It seems that the Taiwanese manufacturer of mobile devices will have to abandon the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating a really serious competition for Nokia and its Lumia 920, because they will not be able to release the largest smartphone based on Windows Phone 8, the whole trouble is the lack of support for 1080p-resolution from the Microsoft operating system.  However, at the same time on the Web there is talk about building closer cooperation between HTC and Microsoft, continuous hints of "big plans".  Are the rumors true?  We will find out soon. </li><li>  The second wave of rumors about a smartphone from Amazon began to <a href="http://gamersweb.ru/news/vtoraya-volna-sluhov-o-smartfone-amazon/">spread on the</a> Web.  Well, let's see what this will eventually pour out.  I must admit that the tablets at Amazon get very much nothing: both in quality and in price. </li></ul><br><br><hr><br>  On our <a href="http://gamersweb.ru/">site</a> you can find news, blogs and podcasts on gaming and IT topics!
