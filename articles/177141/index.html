They describe the features of the form factor and specific platforms, the relationship with applications for smartphones and the ecosystem as a whole.

He gives many practical examples, in particular the success of charitable services, depending on the photos posted. <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://uxarchive.com/">UX Archive</a></strong> <br>  An interesting gallery of mobile application patterns that shows usage scenarios and processes in its entirety.

Part of the pictures, unfortunately, is not available.  <a href="http://www.themachinestarts.com/read/2012-11-how-we-started-calling-visual-metaphors-skeuomorphs-why-apple-design-debate-mess">The correct definition of skeomorphism</a> (as it turned out, Wikipedia gives an incomplete). <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://uxmas.com/">UXmas - Wishing you a great experience through the festive season!</a></strong> <br>  The creators of the resource UX Mastery launched on the eve of Christmas the mini-site UXMas, which gathered an interesting selection of articles, presentations and other materials.  Updated, however, it will not be. <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://www.uxfox.ru/your-content-now-mobile/">Your content now mobile</a></strong> <br>  Translation of an article by Karen McGrane about content adaptation for mobile devices. <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://flip.it/DtU9L">Flipboard-magazine "Review of fresh materials on the design of interfaces"</a></strong> <br>  Flipboard has the opportunity to make their own magazines.  For the sake of experiment, I collected a review for January-March in this format. <br><br><h3>  Understanding the user </h3><br>  <strong><a href="http://cennydd.co.uk/2013/designing-with-context">Designing with context</a></strong> <br>  The Cennydd Bowles Epic Manual on how to take into account the user's current context.  He singles out his seven types ‚Äî the device, the environment, the time, the activity, the user's personal characteristics, the location, the social environment ‚Äî and describes their features in detail. <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://postnauka.ru/longreads/8678">Our perception of the world is a fantasy that coincides with reality.</a></strong> <br>  A good popular science material that describes the basics of modern scientific knowledge about perception and information theory. <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://experiencinginformation.wordpress.com/2013/03/26/user-experience-shape-designing-for-engagement/">User Experience Shape - Designing For Engagement</a></strong> <br>  James Kalbach says that in the case of modern interfaces, we should talk about user involvement rather than experience.  He suggests the term ‚ÄúUX Shape‚Äù, which describes the process of user interaction with the company's products more broadly and subtly. <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://uxdesign.smashingmagazine.com/2013/02/15/designing-great-feedback-loops/">Designing Great Feedback Loops</a></strong> <br>  Loren Baxter talks about the importance of the correct feedback chains that arise when a user works with a product.  This mechanism allows you to better engage the user in solving problems and makes working with the interface more understandable and predictable. <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://usemenot.com.ua/2013/03/22/happy-faces/">Process and result</a></strong> <br>  An article by Yuri Granovsky about the importance of the whole process of using the product by the user.  He talks about the four components that are important for a good experience. <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://uxdesign.smashingmagazine.com/2013/03/12/design-multifaceted-user/">Designing For The Multifaceted User</a></strong> <br>  Stephanie Troeth writes about an interesting way to describe the users of a product that is better suited for designing modern complex products than the rather limited character methodology.  This is a series of sections showing the desires and motives of users depending on a set of behavioral characteristics. <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://www.thoughtworks-studios.com/blog/stop-designing-%25E2%2580%259Cusers%25E2%2580%259D">Stop Designing for ‚ÄúUsers‚Äù</a></strong> <br>  Mike Long is also skeptical of the characters, criticizing them for the fragmentation of interfaces.  Instead, he recommends Activity-Centered Design and offers an interesting method for describing user needs and scenarios. <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://uxmag.com/articles/using-cohort-analysis-to-optimize-customer-experience">Using Cohort Analysis to Optimize Customer Experience</a></strong> <br>  James Torio and Rishabh Dayal describe the cohort concept for user segmentation when designing services.  Like characters, they are based on common patterns of consumer groups. <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://mobile.smashingmagazine.com/2013/01/18/assumptions-about-mobile-to-reconsider/">Think Again - Assumptions About Mobile To Reconsider</a></strong> <br>  A good overview article Karolina Szczur, in which she debunks several irrelevant stereotypes about mobile.  She cites statistics and working products in support of her theses. <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://www.nngroup.com/articles/usability-of-websites-for-teenagers/">Teenage Usability - Designing Teen-Targeted Websites</a></strong> <br>  Jakob Nielsen publishes the results of a study of teenage users on the general level of technology and work with specific services and devices.  He writes that many of the qualities attributed to them, including technical know-how, are a myth. <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://www.measuringusability.com/blog/hypothesis-ux.php">Hypothesis Testing in the User Experience</a></strong> <br>  Jeff Sauro writes about the importance of building and testing hypotheses when conducting user research.  The concept of hypotheses is used in the scientific world and should be applied by interface experts. <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://www.tabletsforschools.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/2011-12-Final-Report.pdf">Dr.</a></strong>  <strong><a href="http://www.tabletsforschools.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/2011-12-Final-Report.pdf">Barbie Clarke, Siv Svanaes - Tables in Secondary Schools - An Evaluation Study</a> (PDF)</strong> <br>  Report by Barbie Clarke and Siv Svanaes on a study of student use of tablets in British high schools.  For two years, schoolchildren attended classes with them, during which many interesting insights were gathered. <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://www.measuringusability.com/blog/ux-mobile.php">15 Mobile UX Facts and Insights</a></strong> <br>  Jeff Sauro provides a selection of facts about mobile and tablet users.  These are numbers of statistical and user research related to the general points of use and work with specific services. <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://boxesandarrows.com/conceptual-models-in-a-nutshell/">Conceptual Models in a Nutshell</a></strong> <br>  Review article by Jeff Johnson and Austin Henderson on conceptual models.  They released the book Conceptual Models: Core to Good Design on this topic in 2011. <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2013/02/how-do-users-really-hold-mobile-devices.php">How Do Users Really Hold Mobile Devices?</a></strong> <br>  Steven Hoober conducted a study on how users hold smartphones.  Although the representativeness of the sample and method is questionable, the conclusions are quite logical. <br><br><h3>  Designing the structure and interface screens </h3><br>  <strong><a href="http://guitoolkits.com/">User Interface Design Toolkits for Mobile and Web Apps</a></strong> <br>  Probably the most ambitious set of templates for design, including all popular platforms and adapted for almost all key tools (except InDesign).

The first part shows how you can combine them with sketches of specific screens for different tasks.  <a href="http://www.inspireux.com/2013/02/17/using-mind-maps-for-ux-design-part-2-research-maps/">The second part</a> . <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://uxmag.com/articles/re-introducing-page-description-diagrams">Re-Introducing Page Description Diagrams</a></strong> <br>  Colin Butler and Andrew Wirtanen recall the diagrams of descriptions of interface screens (Page Description Diagrams) and wonder why this interesting technique is unpopular among modern specialists.  A possible answer is an extra layer of specification in times of lean UX, when the volume of intermediate documents is tried to be minimized. <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://experiencinginformation.wordpress.com/2012/04/09/cross-channel-design-with-alignment-diagrams/">Cross Channel Design With Alignment Diagrams</a></strong> <br>  James Kalbach suggests using relationship charts to design complex interactions involving multiple platforms.
