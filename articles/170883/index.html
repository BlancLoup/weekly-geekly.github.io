After <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/144849/">ZP100</a> is the second phone of this company, which fell into my hands.  However, I already wrote about the phone of a similar form factor: <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/147194/">Haipai I9220 - How the Chinese copied the Galaxy Note, but it turned out to be a 5 "tablet</a> . That phone turned out to be very successful - and the GPS was excellent there, and the battery was excellent, that's just the screen pumped up. That's it Let's see if the ideological follower of I9220 will justify our expectations, but from another company. <br><img src="http://boxoverview.com/vvzvlad/2013/zp950+/index950/13.jpg" alt="image"><br>  By the way, the Chinese seem to have a new trend - Galaxy Note II and S3 phones with the corresponding design and design.  If a year ago it was isolated instances, now it has taken on some mass character - the small phones are getting smaller and smaller.  My colleague has already talked about one of his competitors - <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/boxowerview/blog/174807/">THL W8</a> , and I will talk about a phone of a similar format, but from another company.  In my opinion, the ZP950 is more than a Note, and the W8 is a Chinese S3 / S4 <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fe1/2cf/627/fe12cf627631c626104bcf788ffc6644.png" alt="image">  <b>Screen:</b> 5.7 ", 1280x720, IPS, 258 dpi <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/806/871/aac/806871aac785f1ac7a45fe2360d5ef7a.png" alt="image">  <b>Processor:</b> MTK6589 (1.2 GHz, 4 cores) <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cf7/d69/613/cf7d6961340b5b16fa821567a8cdb089.png" alt="image">  <b>Video accelerator:</b> PowerVR SGX544 <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7ed/145/aaa/7ed145aaabcfa9106c6be7a26f087b92.png" alt="image">  <b>Operating system:</b> Android 4.2.1 (Jelly Bean) <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/08f/b11/4cf/08fb114cf05af12329a682c7d179d012.png" alt="image">  <b>RAM:</b> 1 GB <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/487/aaf/2c0/487aaf2c012384e1cf135a561ba6a5f0.png" alt="image">  <b>User Memory:</b> 4/16 GB <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cb8/0be/398/cb80be398f5ff56284fa2b3191102593.png" alt="image">  <b>Camera:</b> front 5 megapixel, rear - 8 megapixel <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1f0/8d9/6c5/1f08d96c5889f650144a0d8e30a2b5bc.png" alt="image">  <b>Battery:</b> 2500 mAh <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0d6/598/1a8/0d65981a80a55a05019aba9215d64193.png" alt="image">  <b>Dimensions:</b> 158 x 83.5 x 10.2 mm <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/76e/eac/de0/76eeacde0f4056772f442e0b594e031c.png" alt="image">  <b>SAR certified</b> - 0.593W / kg (allowable - 2W / kg) <br><a name="habracut"></a>  In short, the differences from THL W8: an enlarged screen, the resolution of which remained unchanged, a worse camera (however, if you compare photos, it‚Äôs not worse, you just decided to write the truth in zopo) and a large battery capacity (2500 mAh vs. 2000 mAh). <hr><br><br><h4>  <font color="#C98437">‚ñ∫</font> Packing and packaging <br></h4>  Packaging is absolutely not bright and strict.

    <h4>  <font color="#C98437">‚ñ∫</font> Appearance <br></h4> As usual, most of the front of the phone takes up the screen.  Externally, the phone is almost no different from its branded prototype - Note II.  Well, the button is a slightly different form, and is located a little differently, with a large gap.  And there is no ‚ÄúSAMSUNG‚Äù inscription above the screen. <br><img src="http://boxoverview.com/vvzvlad/2013/zp950+/34.jpg" alt="image"><br>  The home button under the screen is one, there are no buttons on the android on the android and there is no menu in the physical form at all.  Instead of them, virtual buttons appear at the bottom of the screen.  The logic of this decision is incomprehensible to me - either completely remove the physical button and fully switch to Nexus-style, or leave the buttons in place and not occupy the screen space.  Also, a little confused by the empty space between the screen and the button.  Even if the length of the phone was dictated by some external conditions, it is difficult to think of what prevented at least moving the button up a bit. <br><img src="http://boxoverview.com/vvzvlad/2013/zp950+/15.jpg" alt="image"><br>  The space above the screen is divided between the conversational speaker, front camera and light and proximity sensors: <br><img src="http://boxoverview.com/vvzvlad/2013/zp950+/17.jpg" alt="image"><br>  On the right side of the side, if you hold the phone to your screen, there are three buttons - the volume rocker and power.  There are no buttons on the left side.  Apparently, this decision is dictated by mounting the additional cover-book on the left.  In this case, the buttons could not be pressed without opening the ‚Äúbook‚Äù in advance. <br><img src="http://boxoverview.com/vvzvlad/2013/zp950+/16.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Behind, too, everything is standard - the camera module with backlight, logo and speaker holes.  Here you can assess the ratio of the size of the subject of the review and its Korean copy :) <br><img src="http://boxoverview.com/vvzvlad/2013/zp950+/31.jpg" alt="image"><br>  The power connector is shifted slightly to the edge.  By the way, I like this solution more than in the middle - it is more convenient to grab. <br><img src="http://boxoverview.com/vvzvlad/2013/zp950+/20.jpg" alt="image"><br>  The thickness is slightly larger, but insignificant. <br><img src="http://boxoverview.com/vvzvlad/2013/zp950+/33.jpg" alt="image"><br>  On the bottom, in addition to the power connector, there is only a microphone hole, of course, there is one here. <br><img src="http://boxoverview.com/vvzvlad/2013/zp950+/45.jpg" alt="image"><br>  By the way, in the last photo you could see a piece of the cover.  Here she is: <br><img src="http://boxoverview.com/vvzvlad/2013/zp950+/09.jpg" alt="image"><br>  The Chinese have moved from the insertion of others' logos to the insertion of their own.  True, the final stage of assembly is still on the conscience of the user.  The logo, by the way, on a beautiful metal plate and looks quite solid: <br><img src="http://boxoverview.com/vvzvlad/2013/zp950+/10.jpg" alt="image"><br>  On the back of the cover there is even an extruded place under the button.  True, it saves weakly - with any serious pressure on the cover, the button is pressed anyway.  Although it is quite tight and without a cover it does not spontaneously press.  Perhaps it depends on the style of use - I could not use the cover, and my wife uses it and says that it is very comfortable. <br><img src="http://boxoverview.com/vvzvlad/2013/zp950+/11.jpg" alt="image"><br>  I have already said that this could have been avoided by removing the button altogether?  :) <br>  The thickness of the phone when using the cover increases slightly: <br><img src="http://boxoverview.com/vvzvlad/2013/zp950+/50.jpg" alt="image"><br>  On the front side of the cover is the extruded code name of the phone: <br><img src="http://boxoverview.com/vvzvlad/2013/zp950+/47.jpg" alt="image"><br>  And a slot for conversational dynamics.  Why - I do not know.  Talk with the cover closed?  Is someone doing this? <br>  Remove the back cover: <br><img src="http://boxoverview.com/vvzvlad/2013/zp950+/37.jpg" alt="image"><br>  By the way, the cover is much tougher than from Note2, although it has the same fastening mechanism (but not compatible).  Because of this, the cover is held very tightly, and disconnecting it is not an easy task.  When it falls, it also flies away.  There is no backlash, but the light does not even creak, but small clicks in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe camera are present. <br>  Battery: <br><img src="http://boxoverview.com/vvzvlad/2013/zp950+/38.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Large in size but flat.  2500 mAh  Both on it and on the phone case there are flood sensors: <br><img src="http://boxoverview.com/vvzvlad/2013/zp950+/40.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Under the battery as usual, the stickers, and at the bottom - GSM / WCDMA antenna: <br><img src="http://boxoverview.com/vvzvlad/2013/zp950+/41.jpg" alt="image"><br>  At the top - film GPS and Wifi / BT antennas: <br><img src="http://boxoverview.com/vvzvlad/2013/zp950+/43.jpg" alt="image"><br>  It is already clear that the hope for an excellent GPS has not come true - there is no ceramic antenna in the phone. <br>  Under the camera jacks of two SIM cards (next to each other).  It is possible to shove a sim card with the battery inserted (if you remember which side - the hint is left under the battery), but there is no longer a pull out.  Next to them is the microSD connector. <br><img src="http://boxoverview.com/vvzvlad/2013/zp950+/42.jpg" alt="image"><br><hr><br><br><h4>  <font color="#C98437">‚ñ∫</font> Specs, screen, camera <br></h4>  To begin with, a set of standard tests: <br><img src="http://boxoverview.com/vvzvlad/2013/zp950+/screenshoot/02.png" alt="image"><img src="http://boxoverview.com/vvzvlad/2013/zp950+/screenshoot/04.png" alt="image"><img src="http://boxoverview.com/vvzvlad/2013/zp950+/screenshoot/09.png" alt="image"><br><img src="http://boxoverview.com/vvzvlad/2013/zp950+/screenshoot/08.png" alt="image"><img src="http://boxoverview.com/vvzvlad/2013/zp950+/screenshoot/07.png" alt="image"><img src="http://boxoverview.com/vvzvlad/2013/zp950+/screenshoot/06.png" alt="image"><br>  In general, the new processor had a very positive effect on the performance of the phone - no brakes were noticed at all, finally, the swype + chrome did not blunt together.  What is nice, the time has not changed. <br><img src="http://boxoverview.com/vvzvlad/2013/zp950+/screenshoot/19.png" alt="image"><br>  But some new graphics accelerator is not noticeable ... <br>  Sensors on site: <br><img src="http://boxoverview.com/vvzvlad/2013/zp950+/screenshoot/13.png" alt="image"><img src="http://boxoverview.com/vvzvlad/2013/zp950+/screenshoot/14.png" alt="image"><img src="http://boxoverview.com/vvzvlad/2013/zp950+/screenshoot/15.png" alt="image"><br>  A GPS - shit.  However, it was clear immediately after removing the back cover - a film antenna, all in the best traditions of the brands, so that they don‚Äôt have time when their ‚Äúgrateful‚Äù users remember with a quiet, kindly word. <br>  No, he, of course, works, and allows you to determine the location, and the accuracy is acceptable - the Chinese would not save at all to the detriment of functionality.  But the speed and clarity with which the satellites caught a ceramic antenna is not in sight. <br>  When driving fast in a car, this is especially noticeable - reception levels jump along with definition accuracy. <br><br>  The camera, oddly enough, is not just ‚Äúthere,‚Äù but it also shoots pretty well even in poor lighting conditions. <br> <a href=""><img src="http://boxoverview.com/vvzvlad/2013/zp950+/camera/03.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br>  Colors do not float, focusing works well. <br> <a href=""><img src="http://boxoverview.com/vvzvlad/2013/zp950+/camera/01.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br>  I liked the camera. <br><br>  The screen after bright and contrasting AMOLED Note II seems pale, but in comparison with other LCD screens it is absolutely normal. <br>  IPS - it is IPS, and when each TN was individual in its own way, it allowed to put two phones side by side and start talking about the angle at which the screen should be turned so that the picture was hard to see.  And now all the screens are exactly the same, only the resolution and pixel density change.  This phone has a PPI of 258, which is not much of course a lot, but it allows you to overlook the pixels.  Well, honestly, I do not see much difference with the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/boxowerview/blog/169545/">Meizu MX2</a> c record PPI 343. <br><hr><br><br><h4>  <font color="#C98437">‚ñ∫</font> About radiation certification <br></h4>  This phone is the first Chinese who fell into my hands, certified by the level of permissible radiation - <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A3%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25B9_%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D1%258D%25D1%2584%25D1%2584%25D0%25B8%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582_%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D1%2589%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F_%25D1%258D%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B9_%25D1%258D%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B8">SAR</a> .  Certification conducted by the German office <a href="http://www.phoenix-testlab.de/">Phoenix TestLab</a> (which is strange, in China, and its many).  Results are valid for the entire line of Zopo 9xx - 900, 900S, 950X, 950H.  They use the same antenna, case and chipset.  Here you can read the full report, but I will focus on the results. <br> <a href=""><img src="http://boxoverview.com/vvzvlad/2013/zp950+/sar/01_M.jpg" alt="image"></a> <a href=""><img src="http://boxoverview.com/vvzvlad/2013/zp950+/sar/02_M.jpg" alt="image"></a> <a href=""><img src="http://boxoverview.com/vvzvlad/2013/zp950+/sar/03_M.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br>  As can be seen from the tables, the phone develops its maximum power during transmission in the GSM-900 standard - 0.593W / kg. <br>  For GSM-1800, this figure is already lower - 0.328W / kg. <br>  From the WiFi transmitter we get 0.363W / kg, and the work in WCDMA mode is 0.484W / kg. <br>  The maximum figure, I remind you, is 2W / kg for Europe and 1.6W / kg for the USA. <br>  Thus, all the fears that the radiation of Chinese phones is slowly roasting the brains of its owner turned out to be groundless. <br><hr><br><br><h4>  <font color="#C98437">‚ñ∫</font> Getting Root and firmware <br></h4>  The firmware process: <br>  1) Download the toolkit. <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bd9/3cf/7c1/bd93cf7c1aa66c9e22aec7ba009fc6e3.png" alt="image">  <a href="">Driver</a> , and <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bd9/3cf/7c1/bd93cf7c1aa66c9e22aec7ba009fc6e3.png" alt="image">  <a href="">flasher</a> , <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bd9/3cf/7c1/bd93cf7c1aa66c9e22aec7ba009fc6e3.png" alt="image">  <a href="">scatter file and recovery</a> , <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bd9/3cf/7c1/bd93cf7c1aa66c9e22aec7ba009fc6e3.png" alt="image">  <a href="">root</a> <br>  2) Root_Superuser_3.1.3_Busybox_1.20.2.zip is copied to the phone's memory card, Recovery + root.zip is unpacked into a folder on the computer. <br>  3) Run the program (Flash_tool.exe) on behalf of the administrator, press the Scatter-loading button, select the txt file with the unpacked firmware, which stores information about the addresses for which the firmware should be uploaded.  Click Download.  The phone is not connected! <br><img src="http://boxoverview.com/vvzvlad/2013/zp950+/spft.png" alt="image"><br>  2) Turn off the phone, remove-insert the battery, hold down the volume +, insert the cable.  The system swears at the new device, we slip (if necessary - by force) the driver from the first paragraph.  As soon as the driver is installed, the program will find the phone, flood the preloader with it (via com port emulation, slowly a red stripe), and launch it.  Having started, the bootloader will get comfortable in the phone, will raise a full-fledged high-speed USB interface, to which the system, as always, will ask for the driver.  Perhaps they will deliver them automatically, then skip the next item. <br>  2.1) If the meter in the program counted, but did not find a new interface.  Go to the device manager, see an unidentified device, install the same driver for it from the first item.  Repeat point 2. <br>  3) If everything went well, the program will find the USB interface, then the flash driver will load (lilac stripe), which will already accept the firmware and stuff it into the phone‚Äôs memory (yellow stripe).  After that, a window will pop up with a green circle - that's it.  We distort the battery, press the power button.  To download to the recovery - volume + and power button at the same time. <br>  4) Boot into Recovery, select ‚Äúbackup and restore‚Äù, ‚ÄúBackup‚Äù, ‚ÄúYES‚Äù.  After that, the image of the current firmware will be saved on the memory card, which can always be restored via the menu item ‚Äúrestore‚Äù.  This is just in case something goes wrong.  Also, I draw your attention to the fact that you cannot use a general reset from the phone menu, if a third-party Recovery is installed - you will receive a cyclic reboot, and you will have to restore from backup. <br>  5) Now select ‚Äúinstall zip from sd card‚Äù, go to it with the power button, select the previously copied Root_Superuser_3.1.3_Busybox_1.20.2.zip file and install it.

As a navigator, the phone is not very suitable, but in general it is very interesting. <br><br>  The phone is available in the BuySku store in two colors - white and gray, and with 4GB or 16GB memory. <br>  4GB version costs $ 265: <a href="http://www.buysku.com/wholesale/zopo-zp950-phablet-android-4-1-mtk6589-quad-core-1gb-4gb-gps-dual-camera-5-7-inch-hd-ips-3g-smartphone-grey_40655.html">in gray</a> , <a href="http://www.buysku.com/wholesale/zopo-zp950-phablet-android-4-1-mtk6589-quad-core-1gb-4gb-gps-dual-camera-5-7-inch-hd-ips-3g-smartphone-white_40655.html">in white</a> <br>  16GB version costs $ 280: <a href="http://www.buysku.com/wholesale/zopo-zp950-mtk6589-quad-core-5-7-inch-ips-hd-screen-1gb-16gb-android-4-1-gps-5-0mp-front-camera-3g-smartphone-grey_40655.html">in gray</a> , <a href="http://www.buysku.com/wholesale/zopo-zp950-mtk6589-quad-core-5-7-inch-ips-hd-screen-1gb-16gb-android-4-1-gps-5-0mp-front-camera-3g-smartphone-white_40655.html">in white</a> <hr><br><br><h4>  <font color="#C98437">‚ñ∫</font> Links <br></h4><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a84/e50/fde/a84e50fdea1278f0897208fabd940130.png" alt="image">  <a href="http://4pda.ru/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D439116">Talk firmware</a> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a84/e50/fde/a84e50fdea1278f0897208fabd940130.png" alt="image">  <a href="http://4pda.ru/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D404804">Phone talk</a> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a84/e50/fde/a84e50fdea1278f0897208fabd940130.png" alt="image">  <a href="http://4pda.ru/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D441121">Accessories talk</a> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/702/2a5/43a/7022a543afbee5485397326530cd6f7b.png" alt="image">  <a href="http://forum.china-iphone.ru/zopo-zp950-leader-max-5-7-1280-720-mtk6589-1gb-4-16-gb-t24148.html">Theme on china-iphone</a> <br><br>  If you do not have an account on Habrahabr, you can read and comment on our articles on <a href="http://boxoverview.com/">BoxOverview.com</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/170883/">https://habr.com/ru/post/170883/</a></p>
