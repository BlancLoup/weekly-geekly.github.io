      <b>What was the 1st day?</b> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Opening Speech by Alexey Vladyshev, Director and Founder of Zabbix </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/d7/86/59d786e920663450143130.jpeg"><br><br>  By tradition, the conference was opened by Alexey Vladyshev, who spoke about the statistics of the conference participants, the latest achievements of Zabbix and product news expected in the near future.  It mainly focused on event correlation, IT services, improvement in Zabbix performance, box templates, and product release exit policies. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/d7/86/59d786e96ff92442888151.jpeg"><br><br>  What do you think, what country is on the 1st place by the number of participants of the conference this year?  Look for the answer in the presentation too! <br><br><h3>  Steven Bush (Steven Bush) about using Zabbix in SAS </h3><br>  SAS is still using Zabbix 2.2 and is still satisfied.  1000 hosts, 30 proxies, 1100 users. <br><br>  Tips on how to improve Zabbix performance: <br><br><ul><li>  Frontend: <br>  Use Nginx instead of Apache </li><li>  Backend: <br><br>  Download data collection using proxy </li><li>  Database: <br><br>  Use pgbouncer for Postgres to reduce the number of connections to the database server.  But the company is going to migrate to Oracle, since the company itself has more Oracle DBA specialists. <br><br>  Conduct continuous backup (live data stream) </li></ul><br>  Integration with LDAP is done through Zabbix API.  Services are checked through synthetic transactions. <br><br>  Zabbix is ‚Äã‚Äãintegrated with: <br><br><ul><li>  Jira </li><li>  Amazon web services </li><li>  and etc. </li></ul><br>  Written loadable modules: <br><br><ul><li>  Agent modules for collecting SAS internal metrics </li><li>  License Verification Module </li></ul><br><h3>  Using Zabbix in DevOps at the University of Oslo, Rafael Martinez Guerro </h3><br>  Developers usually do not want to engage in setting up monitoring, and maintenance specialists have no time to study the details of the internal design of applications.  But they need to find a common language, to build a system that helps to interact effectively.  And here a lot depends on the automation of this process. <br><br>  Rafael Martinez Guerrero spoke about the DevOps environment at the University of Oslo, where Zabbix plays an important role with Inventory and Configuration management, along with Nivlheim and CFengine. <br><br><h3>  Ingus Vilnis: For those who do not yet know what's new in Zabbix 3.4 </h3><br>  A vivid overview of the most interesting Zabbix 3.4 chips from Ingus Vilnis, the head of the support team.  In the presentation there are a lot of concrete examples of using new functions and describing the benefits of the transition to Zabbix 3.4. <br><br><h3>  Andrew Nelson, Red Hat, His Red Hat and Ansible </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/d7/88/59d788f553191647037794.jpeg"><br><br>  Andrew Nelson (Andrew Nelson) talked about how Ansible can help in using Zabbix in configuration management and agent deployment. <br><br>  As well as information about Ansible Tower: how to further simplify the use of Ansible c Zabbix (see github source version <a href="https://github.com/ansible/awx">github.com/ansible/awx</a> ) <br><br><h3>  Large Zabbix Cluster.  How to do it right.  Vladimir Ulogov </h3><br>  Vladimir began with a brief review of modern cloud technologies ‚Äúfor dummies‚Äù.  Next is how to deploy Zabbix in the clouds.  What architecture is suitable for this?  What, in general, are possible options?  Vladimir's speech is full of useful tips on these topics. <br><br><h3>  Switching to Zabbix - The History of Orange Slovensko by Gabriela Farkas </h3><br>  What makes big telecoms move away from traditional commercial monitoring solutions? <br>  First of all - this is the price of the license.  Or ‚Äúlicensed prison‚Äù by the exact definition of Gabriel Farkas from Orange Slovensko. <br><br>  What helped him to choose Zabbix among other open source solutions?  Gossip!  ;) And the diverse experience of his partner from Slovakia. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/d7/88/59d788f5a52ea751071300.jpeg"><br><br>  Zabbix considers Fault managemant, Performance management, SLA, Inventory, web monitoring and a number of other things to be its strengths. <br><br>  See the presentation for details on how Orange Slovensko planned the migration to Zabbix, how it went, and what they will do next. <br><br><h3>  Zabbix in a large enterprise.  The story of Gardner Denver.  Chris McKenna </h3><br>  Chris (Chris McKenna) gives another example of how well-known enterprises benefit from using open source solutions such as Zabbix. <br><br>  The presentation tells the story of how IT Managed Solutions has built a powerful and effective monitoring solution based on Zabbix using Grafana, Victor Ops and ServiceNow. <br><br><h3>  Emulator Zabbix agent for AS / 400.  An interesting example of a non-trivial solution from Zabbix user </h3><br>  An experienced Zabbix user, system analyst from Rietumu Bank Konstantin Oshmyan, spoke about why the bank chose Zabbix to monitor IBM AS / 400 and other IBM solutions.  While earlier IBM Tivoli was used for monitoring. <br><br>  The main reasons are: Zabbix simplicity, SLA management, friendly technical support. <br><br>  Since there was no ready-made Zabbix agent for AS / 400, Konstantin developed his own agent emulator using the Zabbix agent protocol. <br><br>  Download it here: <a href="https://share.zabbix.com/">share.zabbix.com</a> <br><br><h3>  Case study: monitoring 7,000 servers at Intesa Sanpaolo Bank </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/d7/88/59d788f4c183f195715450.jpeg"><br><br>  Quadrata employees told the story of the successful use of Zabbix for monitoring large-scale IT infrastructure on the example of a leading Italian bank.  In the presentation, a number of details of the solution for monitoring Veritas cluster using Zabbix and how Zabbix API is used to build a custom dashboard. <br><br><h3>  Patrick Jutterhoven on the way to full automation Zabbix </h3><br>  Patrik (Patrik Uytterhoeven) spoke about the experience of automating processes in Zabbix and the problems overcome in this way. <br><br>  The presentation details the choice of hardware, software settings, the use of Smart templates, scripts for automation, Grafana, LLD (which appeared in Zabbix including as a result of their order). <br><br>  Worthy result - this is how the queue for updating data items now looks like: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/d7/88/59d788f4c3ef4100379270.jpeg"><br><br><h3>  About the importance of being ... red </h3><br>  A good monitoring solution is needed by all.  Moreover, if you are one of the world leaders in luxury online retail! <br><br>  Andrea and Enrico - two expressive Italian admins who are responsible for monitoring at Yoox Net-A-Porter Group (luxury fashion), told how they use Zabbix, deployed on AWS. <br><br>  Although the slides convey only a part of their emotional performance, they also have many useful details on how to build monitoring in the cloud. <br><br>  What happened on the 2nd day - read our next blog! <br><br>  All the presentations mentioned above can be viewed <a href="https://www.zabbix.com/conf2017_agenda">here</a> .  Videos will be coming soon! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/d7/88/59d788f5a0154151727575.jpeg"><br><br>  PS article is also available in English in our <a href="http://blog.zabbix.com/highlights-of-zabbix-conference-2017-day-1/">blog</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/339516/">https://habr.com/ru/post/339516/</a></p>
