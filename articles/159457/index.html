  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Mobile Applications Era: Search for Applications - the real story in the heyday of the AppStor</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  With the development of custom personal devices, technologies and platforms, the access of consumers and third-party companies to the formation of the final product has become a reality. <br><br>  Apple and Google giants quickly realized that it is impossible to control absolutely all aspects of the development and development of services, and, having opened access to application development technologies to third-party companies, they received an excellent tool for identifying the most popular products and additional tools for monetizing the application market.  As a bonus from the open door policy, these companies have the opportunity to purchase various insights to improve and develop their own services. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  As a result, hundreds of thousands of developers, millions of applications, and the widespread replacement of simple mobile phones with functional smartphones. <br><br>  It quickly became clear that, against the background of this abundance of proposals, finding the right and high-quality applications for the user becomes not just a pressing, but not entirely trivial task.  To help AppStor'am with their imperfect search systems, user reviews and ratings, came blogs, community sites and portals about applications, with their own ratings, rating systems and catalogs.

      The companies specializing in application discovery were not long in coming.  Alternative application sites are formed on the basis of more technological solutions that work with data, which can be obtained directly from the AppStor catalogs.  Some of them show impressive results, working with individual categories of applications. <br><br>  A good example is the <a href="http://appsfire.com/">AppsFire</a> service.  It attracts the mass consumer by providing the collected information about new applications and software, which is subject to discounts.  In addition, <a href="http://appsfire.com/">AppsFire</a> supports a user-friendly directory form and makes it possible to recommend the applications you like. <br><br>  An example of another approach to the application recommendation service is the <a href="http://www.zwapp.com/">Zwapp</a> project, which works directly with the user's phone content.  It defines already installed applications and creates user profiles in the form of application collections.  <a href="http://www.zwapp.com/">Zwapp</a> uses mechanisms similar to social networks to organize connections and relationships between users. <br><br>  In addition, it is worth mentioning the companies developing application search technologies, including <a href="http://www.uquery.com/">uQuery</a> and <a href="http://chomp.com/">Chomp</a> .  The last one since February 2012 is part of Apple, and in October it was completely closed to users.  A good and convenient search organization is an integral part of any such service that does not require special comments. <br><br>  Yandex and Google search engines also rushed to take their market share.  Google‚Äôs developers went in a proven way and added an application search section to the main search engine, along with searching by images, videos, maps, etc. Yandex presented a mobile version of the search service for applications, the main advantage of which can be considered as the implementation of the search capability by keywords. <br><br>  The Russian-speaking sector cannot boast of a large number of specialized search services for applications, but the niche is gradually being filled.  Among the newbies, <a href="http://theappbay.com/ru/">TheAppBay is</a> more or less interesting, using the principle of recommendations from users, especially if the developers further expand it with advanced filters according to various criteria. <br><br>  Only about two dozen companies are working today in one form or another on the problem of applications discovery, which is already a lot. <br><br>  They constantly test the relevance and convenience of various approaches and search patterns for applications.  Today, all services in this area are united by dependence, to one degree or another, on platform holders - Apple, Google and others, whose interfaces and infrastructure are the limiting factor that no single player on the market can influence.  For the same reason, the end user with his interests, preferences, and behavioral characteristics is not a central element of these services.  Will the situation change with time?  Who knows. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/159457/">https://habr.com/ru/post/159457/</a></p>
