I want to immediately warn that the article contains only constructive criticism of software and hardware, as well as ways to solve most problems.  So the drama and tragedy in the spirit of "aah!  all is lost, return the money "do not wait. <br><br><img src="http://habrastorage.org/files/d6b/49e/b46/d6b49eb46c494027bbffce092684c0a6.png" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  To begin, praise Sony.  The release of the Android smartphone on a compact size with top-end filling has become, for many, a breath of fresh air in the world of spades.  Now Xperia Z1 Compact is the most desirable device on version w3bsit3-dns.com. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b17/2c1/451/b172c145129f144bd45a914fa2584a36.png">

      The post is designed for people who are still going to purchase the Z1 Compact.  All information is reliable at 146%, confirmed by personal experience, as well as _multiple_ reviews on large resources w3bsit3-dns.com and xda. <br><br><h4>  The film on the screen by default </h4><br>  The smartphone is equipped with a tempered, scratch-resistant glass (and not Gorilla Glass, but something of its own), sealed with protective factory film.  In fact, this is already an old story for Sony, they have been doing it for a long time.  At first I thought it was a big plus.  Plenochki people we love to glue.  And, for a start, it must be purchased, and then it must be installed evenly and without bubbles. <br><br>  In reality, it turned out: <br>  1) Sony film attracts dust in his pocket.  I do not know what laws of physics explain it, but it is so.  My last Motorola Droid Razr M phone always had a clean screen. <br>  2) Factory film scratches pretty well. <br>  3) If you remove the factory film, then you lose the logo (also an old story). <br><br>  The solutions are obvious: <br>  1) to score (like me) <br>  2) Glue on top of another <br><br><h4>  Premium plastic </h4><br>  In all preliminary reviews, all known resources pushed through the most important idea: the Z1 Compact is the same as the flagship Z1, only of a smaller size.  And, like an older brother, made of premium materials - metal and glass.  Of course, there are no complaints to reviewers, that they wrote in the press release - that‚Äôs the truth :) <br>  For the interest of a couple of links (with timing, so as not to look for the right moment): <br>  1) <a href="http://youtu.be/M4IsjPv4ZFM%3Ft%3D1m27s">Video Review from the store Rozetka.ua</a> <br>  2) <a href="http://youtu.be/N2mgIUmZYz4%3Ft%3D1m25s">Mobile Review Video Review</a> <br>  3) <a href="http://www.ixbt.com/mobile/sony-xperia-z1-compact.shtml">Text review from ixbt</a> <br><br>  However, the first buyers noticed that the back cover is extremely quickly scratched and is hardly made of glass.  As a result, Sony under the pressure of Internet warriors officially announced that the back cover is made of plastic. <br>  The xperiablog resource even watched closely for changes in the whitepaper <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f55/abc/004/f55abc00445ec0d7f66cf920c4da846f.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b52/f78/6dc/b52f786dc68d2936f7c8230acb83a652.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Solutions: <br>  1) Case <br>  2) Transparent film <br>  3) Opaque film or carbon (on this version I stopped) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9de/3d5/634/9de3d56344693b0f28cd0b23f904bdee.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Lottery with screens </h4><br>  Also an old story.  Sony puts in one model screens of different manufacturers.  These are JDI (Japan Display Inc) and AOU (AU Optronics Corp).  JDI is considered better.  On the xperiablog resource you can <a href="http://www.xperiablog.net/2014/01/06/sony-using-two-different-displays-for-the-xperia-z1-f-will-the-display-lottery-affect-the-global-xperia-z1-mini/">see the comparison</a> .  It is impossible to calculate in advance in any way what kind of screen a particular instance will have.  When the device is already on hand, in any file manager (except the built-in one) you need to go to the / sys / devices / mdss_dsi_panel / panel_id directory and open a text file. <br><br><h4>  Airplane mode </h4><br>  I was surprised to find that starting from version Android 4.2 for some reason, they prohibited third-party applications from switching the phone to the ‚ÄúAirplane‚Äù mode.  I'm very used to the fact that the device automatically switches to this mode at night.  First, no one will disturb the sweet dream, and secondly, the battery is not wasted at all (Former Motorola did not lose a single percent in 7 hours).  Now neither Tasker, nor LIama, nor any desktop widget can do this.  It is clear that Sony itself has nothing to do with it, but they could stuff Smart Connect into their pre-installed software. <br><br>  No solution. <br><br><h4>  Curve scrolling </h4><br>  Hold the phone with one hand and thumb down the page.  Instead of scrolling, we get an increase in scale (pinch to zoom is activated).  It happens very often.  Annoying.  Hopefully they will fix it in the next update. <br><br><h4>  Delay on the display from the proximity sensor </h4><br>  Standard functionality of any smartphone.  Make a call, bring the z1 compact in the face, the proximity sensor turns off the screen so that it is not pressed with a cheek.  When the phone is removed from the face, the screen remains off for another 1-2 seconds.  At first I thought it was nonsense.  But in life is very uncomfortable.  And if you communicate with the robot, wandering around the menu, it turns into horror. <br><br>  Solution: wait for the update or get root and edit ro.telephony.call_ring.delay in build.prop <br><br><h4>  Problem with launching the camera and unlocking in Stamina mode </h4><br>  If you use the corporate energy-saving mode of Stamina, then be prepared for the fact that pressing the photo call button will work through time.  Also, the device may not respond to the power button (very rarely, but it happens). <br><br>  Solution: do not use Stamina and wait for the fix in the update <br><br><h4>  Incomprehensible message in the status bar about logging into the network. </h4><br>  From time to time I observe this message in my notification bar. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ae0/6cb/411/ae06cb41102b004d948c0c8f75d23dd1.png"><br><br>  On the forums they confirm: Simka is new, it was also on the old one, the firmware is already the third, including the drain.  Lte works fine when I get to the coverage area.  I didn‚Äôt reveal patterns, I‚Äôm just looking like ... MTS Moscow Time. <br><br>  No solution. <br><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4><br>  He did not touch the topic of ‚ÄúCamera‚Äù, since for me it is not very important. <br>  People like the screen, but after AMOLED in Motorola _for me, it is pale.  Unscrew the brightness by 55%.  You can live, but it affects the battery. <br>  I hope such a consolidated post will be useful to someone who has his eye on the Sony Xperia Z1 Compact.  In any case, the majority of software jambs (hopefully) will be fixed.  And the device came out very interesting. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/215001/">https://habr.com/ru/post/215001/</a></p>
