The standard yellow Pegman figure is shown when viewing the panoramas of most streets, there are also several options for Easter eggs.  And you probably didn‚Äôt even think about how much effort its final form required.  After all, even so seemingly small detail has actually been developed for a long time and carefully, and many options have been tried before today's Pegman. <br><br>  The marker appeared in response to a noticeable disorientation effect, called the metro effect.  In the same way as in the underground transport after leaving the car, it was impossible to understand where you are and in which direction of the flat map you can see on the panoramic 3D survey.  A yellow line was added to the review showing the direction of the street detour by a panoramic shooting machine, but this did not help much. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><table><tbody><tr><td><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2d2/cfc/801/2d2cfc801aedfb9c8abee31fce278afd.jpg" align="right">  The first marker was an ordinary eye.  At first it was impossible to understand which way he was looking, so a small arrow was added to the eye.  Andy ≈†ibalski, the author of the original marker, who is currently working on the Android team, says that using an eyeball as a marker did not cause pleasant emotions - who wants to throw a part of the human body at the map?  The marker was also too soft.  It was unclear whether the eyeball should respond to placing it on the map or not.  Then Andy asked for help from Ryan Germika (today is the head of the doodles team). </td></tr><tr><td><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4cd/c28/ff2/4cdc28ff27870a1e59f91284bb9f1744.jpg" align="right">  Why not be a female token?  Feministically-minded, Ryan created a peg woman who did an excellent job with her task.  The clothes, hairstyle and curves of the marker's body made it easy to see which way she was looking.  Bulk marker was a huge step forward. </td></tr><tr><td><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/461/b7e/dfa/461b7edfa45b776341af7a3c33c01f7a.jpg" align="right">  If Pegwuman had been used today, she would have looked like this. <br><br>  In Google, however, they quickly noticed that the more the marker looks like a real person, the more it distracts.  Users began to build associations, comparing the little man with living people - relatives and acquaintances, and after that they could not understand what the image of this person was doing on the web service map. </td></tr><tr><td><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c6b/4fd/c80/c6b4fdc804f4d2ed3e86613c514ad9d8.jpg" align="right">  Therefore, the designers went to the other extreme, and created a completely non-human character.  Tofumen came out angular and only vaguely resembled a living person. </td></tr><tr><td><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3a3/037/42a/3a303742aa7dd15071f0f5595bbaaa72.jpg" align="right">  The personality, enclosed in the character's facial expressions and emotions, was slightly modified.  The character was given a blue color. </td></tr><tr><td><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/425/4dd/821/4254dd821e17246c4da0366a616d6d76.jpg" align="right">  Were tried blue, purple, white and green.  In the end, the designers settled on orange, as the most unbiased color, not associated with any race or nationality. </td></tr><tr><td><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/189/a78/bd6/189a78bd6b409858e23f79eb8e5d5c36.jpg" align="right">  Designers have experimented with other metaphors of photographing, looking and pointing. </td></tr><tr><td><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2b9/1f0/5a8/2b91f05a8b9528fbb0c82bbf567e4f41.jpg" align="right">  For example, instead of an arrow a small flashlight was offered in the character‚Äôs hand. </td></tr><tr><td><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/67f/57d/80f/67f57d80f271455f0de15c2a60a003a5.jpg" align="right">  As a result, it was decided that the man like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gumby">Gambi</a> , the main character of the eponymous American animated series, will be helplessly dangling in the capture of a god-like user. </td></tr><tr><td><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9de/125/044/9de125044f554566ad1ff93ba5d360f7.jpg" align="right">  Like a good haiku, the image became simpler and simpler.  In Pegman's design, only the elements necessary for communication with the user remained, everything superfluous was cut out. </td></tr><tr><td>  The human marker is featured in many Street View commercials, for example, in this one, which is also interesting with the singing of Ryan Germika himself.
