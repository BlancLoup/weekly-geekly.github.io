  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Hunger (possible future)</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Having imagined a terrible situation in the days preceding the shift, and in the following, many kind-hearted people will wonder what they should do now, when they had only one loaf of bread for dinner, and they had to feed a thousand mouths.  For many, it is, of course, no different from today.  In many underdeveloped countries that exist throughout the world, hunger is rampant, so only those who live in prosperity will be surprised at such things.  And those who are already starving, know how to handle these issues.  But depending on the spiritual orientation, the reaction to hunger is very different.  In the Service-to-Self gang, food is pulled from the weak and either sold at any price that the desperate market can take out, or add it to their reserves, even if it rots there without consumption.  Those who have not chosen their spiritual orientation will be indecisive whether to share with a friend now, thrusting to him what he could hide in his pocket, surrounded by robbers, and then regret it, or loudly lament about the situation in the hope that they will save you.  Convincedly, the Service-to-Others are working more according to plan, having solved all these questions for themselves much earlier - in previous lives. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In general, depending on the culture and the situation, certain parts of human society were chosen to simply starve to death.  In many cultures, this happens today, when the oldest and the weak are refusing food, and within a few days - during their rather painless extinction to a state of coma and death - a tender farewell occurs.  They are expected to do so, because in cultures such as American Indians, who often belong to those who are firmly oriented to the Service to Others, the elderly receive great respect, and this does not look like a punishment for age, but rather an honor.  In other cultures, they are treated this way, completely without malice, with the youngest.  Children who have just been born and hardly have a consciousness are left to die to their own elements, or they are left without milk or other liquids, due to which they quickly fall into a coma.  No new mouths to feed.  So that it does not seem terrible, it must be known that brain damage can be an alternative for this child when fasting at an early age, if he remains alive at all - an alternative that society is acutely aware of, having such examples before them.  If hunger spreads beyond this level, a similar selection process takes place in the group again ‚Äî those who are already sick and seemingly not recover, voluntarily go to it, or an adult member of the family group decides that their share should go to growing children or the rest. a member of a married couple.  Dying from hunger or thirst is painless, and if it happens with love and taking into account the interests of the group, then great suffering does not arise. <br><br>  If we look at the situation in a group where the service-to-other culture is not so high and the group is mixed, then what will its leader, the Service-to-Other, do?  The choice is this: out of sympathy for others, start starving yourself, leaving the group under the guidance of more violent types, or make a plan.  In this case, you should not just choose volunteers who are ready to starve to death, since in the end, after this only heartless ones will remain.  A meeting of the community should be appointed at which this issue should be discussed.  It should be expected that the egoists will loudly insist, so that first of all they will give an opportunity to eat them.  The question must be presented in the light of what human communities have always done in the face of a formidable famine.  If food can be obtained by hunting and fishing, then you need to save the best hunter or fisherman.  If a nursing mother feeds several babies, then her survival matters not only for herself.  If someone has a skill or talent necessary or conducive to the survival of the whole group, then, despite their desire to give their share to others, you need to insist that they take care of themselves.  Even groups of egoists will see that they need to take a particular approach, and after disputes, agreement will prevail. <br><br>  All this suggests that all means of feeding the group should be considered, which includes all food sources.  We mentioned that weeds and insects should be included in the diet.  In the face of hunger, the possibility of eating the dead should also be considered.  The soul leaves, and the body rots, and it is better to give it to those who fight for life with love than to leave it to rot.  In the end, this loving member of the group would like the same when he voluntarily agreed to help others starve.  His or her last words could be like this: do not let me fall in vain!  Or is it better if the hunter does not hit the target, and when the nurse gives a single protein to a baby with a growing brain, the milk starts to disappear, and as a result of her starvation, the child grows up with a damaged brain?  You decide.
