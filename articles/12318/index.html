  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Opening a business. Legalization.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  This article will tell you how to legally open a business in Ukraine. <br><br>  Why legalization may be needed?  There may be various reasons, for example, you want a good retirement and length of service, you need a regular legal income for a loan, insurance, and so on.  Well, the most compelling reason - you need to sign contracts, open bank accounts and so on. <br><br>  First you need to choose a form of entrepreneurship.  The easiest way to start with SPD is the individual entrepreneur.  Making it the easiest way, it requires minimal reporting, and so on.  We take the passport and identification code, we go to our district administration.  There we learn the details, we are going to pay to the nearest bank 34 UAH.  We return, fill out a special form, indicate what we will do, stand in a queue for a bit ... Registration takes place very quickly, and on the same day you receive a certificate of state registration of business activities.  A few days later you need to pick up an extract from the pension fund, you will need it when opening a bank account. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      After receiving the certificate you can go to the tax.  There is a special room in which new entrepreneurs are registered.  Before you go there you need to fill out a special form that you can buy there in the tax on the layout, make a photocopy of the certificate, passport and identification code.  After this, we again stand in a queue, wait, go in, give documents, we are informed by our inspector.  After we go to the inspector, and already finalized.  You can choose one of two types of taxes: single (200 UAH per month, regardless of profit, but the profit should not exceed 500 000 UAH per year) and total (15% of the profits).  Single tax is beneficial for those who have income more than 1400 UAH per month.  Actually, the tax is over.  It is only necessary to submit a declaration once a quarter.  Please note, if you are more than 40 days late - fine. <br><br>  Next we need a seal for the signing of contracts and not only.  For this procedure, we need to notarize 2 copies of the certificate of state registration of entrepreneurship.  We go to the permitting authority of the area.  In the same place to you will offer services in manufacturing printing.  Write a statement, draw a sketch of the print, leave a photocopy of all documents, plus a certified copy of the certificate.  Exactly a week later, printing and permission will be ready.  Permission costs 51 UAH, printing - 105 UAH (it can be cheaper, it can be more expensive). <br><br>  Next, a bank account (I chose PrivatBank).  We take with you absolutely all documents and their copies, stamp and certified copy of the certificate.  You need to open 2 accounts: one card, the other non-cash.  For non-cash you will perform all the necessary operations, in order to withdraw money from it, it is necessary to transfer to the card, and only then to withdraw.  You can have one, but it will be very expensive to cash out by checkbook.  We fill in a huge questionnaire, wait for 2 days - we get the account details.  Card pick up after 2 weeks.  If you need to connect to the client-bank system, you will have to come one more time.  The client-bank gives you the opportunity to make transfers via the Internet, to look who and for what you have transferred money and so on.  Worth - 30 UAH per month.  Opening an account is free. <br><br>  Total it took 2 weeks time and 200 UAH.  There are organizations that will do everything for you, it will cost considerably more, but you can save time and money with it.  If you have any questions - I will answer with pleasure. <br><br>  Original article in the blog " <a href="http://korkin.com/">Business and Psychology</a> ." </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/12318/">https://habr.com/ru/post/12318/</a></p>
