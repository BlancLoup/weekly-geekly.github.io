  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Fashion cleaning: this year, AddVenture‚Äôs investment in Qlean service rose to 250 million rubles (UPD: comments)</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The Russian venture fund <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addventure">AddVenture</a> re-invested in the online cleaning service <a href="https://qlean.ru/">Qlean.ru</a> .  Last year, the service received 70 million rubles.  This time the amount is 3.5 times more.  The funds Qlean will send to the regional expansion in the million cities.  In addition to expansion, the company will allocate funds for marketing and adding related services (for example, dry cleaning). <br><br>  According to analysts, after the transaction, the company's valuation should reach 1 billion rubles. <br><br>  ‚ÄúWe are seeing a rise in the popularity of marketplace in the home services segment in many countries: in the USA, Great Britain, continental Europe, Turkey, Southeast Asia, India and the Middle East.  Cleaning is one of the key verticals, and almost everywhere it develops according to the Uber-model, ‚Äùreasons the fund's managing partner, Maxim Medvedev. <a name="habracut"></a><br><blockquote>  Service Qlean.ru was created in 2014 by designers Alexander Korovin and Nikita Pavlov and the former head of the banking department Nikita Repeshko.  Now the service conducts more than 500 cleanings per day by about 600 performers.  The company's turnover is about 50 million rubles a month, with an average check of 2.5 thousand rubles.  He earns from the commission from the order, which, according to the interlocutors of Kommersant in the venture capital market, is 20%. </blockquote>  Qlean.ru also intends to consolidate the cleaning market in Russia.  As part of its internal platform, the service offers cleaning companies to join it in a franchise or M &amp; A format, indicates Qlean marketing director and co-owner Roman Kumar Vias.

      Covering millionaires gradually, it is possible to grow exponentially within five to seven years, said Anna Yanchevskaya, a spokesman for <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A1%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0_%25D0%259C%25D0%25B0%25D1%2581%25D1%2581-%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B0">Sistema Mass Media</a> .  In her opinion, the model of such marketplaces is good because it does not require large investments at the start. <br><br>  ‚ÄúAmong the risks are low quality control of services, especially in our country where there is no licensing of such a profession, high turnover of personnel, model replicability and low entry threshold for other players.  As a rule, with the appearance of a large number of competitors, such marketplaces begin to require substantial marketing costs, which greatly affects their economies, ‚Äùsays Ms Yanchevskaya. <br><br>  Megamind <a href="https://megamozg.ru/post/24838/">wrote</a> that on March 17, <a href="http://gett.com/ru/">Gett</a> (owns the GetTaxi service) launched a new function, Gett, Cleaning in Moscow to call a flatbed cleaner.  The Gett Housekeeping service was launched jointly with Qlean.  The possibility of ordering cleaning is available to residents of Moscow within the Moscow Ring Road, but in the future the geography of the service will be expanded. <br><br>  ‚ÄúQlean.ru is a well-built service, but finding a rational explanation for its popularity is difficult,‚Äù <a href="http://www.kommersant.ru/doc/2945356">said</a> Alexey Solovyov, managing director of <a href="http://prostor-capital.ru/">Prostor Capital</a> , to Kommersant.  He cites the example of Uber, which proposed a fundamentally new approach to ordering a taxi, changed the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe speed of the car.  In addition, the audience has accumulated a critical mass of smartphones, without which the model would not have worked. <br><br>  ‚ÄúHow long will the cleaning fashion last?‚Äù  The popularity of Qlean.ru does not have technological prerequisites, so I would rate its chances as 50 to 50 - it can break into Russian unicorns, or it can repeat the fate of coupon services, ‚Äùhe sums up. <br><br><h4>  Marketing Director and Co-owner of Qlean, Roman Kumar Vias, commented on the above statement: </h4><br><blockquote>  The secret of our popularity, incomprehensible to experts and analysts, lies in a few things. <br><br>  First, we are building our own training system for clinics, instead of acting as an ordinary layer between them and customers.  We spend time and money on training, internships of cleaners and automation of the cleaning process.  We have a 30-page bible - ‚ÄúThe Path of the Cliner‚Äù, which describes the cleaning process and a lot of small things that every clinician should know, take into account and be able to. <br><br>  Secondly, we have our own CRM-system with machine learning, which allows you to collect and analyze a huge amount of information factors about the orders, assessments that customers put to customers, spending inventory and so on.  On the basis of this knowledge, we can predict the further interaction of clients and customers, see their shortcomings and immediately correct them. <br><br>  Thirdly, unlike many services that have been otted, Qlean.ru is always and in any situation on the client‚Äôs side.  We insure the client‚Äôs property for 5 million rubles at the time of cleaning, we respond to feedback and comments, we are always in dialogue with our customers - of course, they see and feel it.  And love us. <br><br>  An interesting fact: last year, anyone who has ordered cleaning at least once on average recommended our service to 1.9 friends.  It would be interesting to know which of the b2c services on the market this indicator is higher. <br><br>  This is the whole secret from which the ‚Äúfashion to order cleaning‚Äù was born, which may seem mysterious to someone.  By the way, we are sure that if we didn‚Äôt become the progenitors of this fashion, then at least we contributed a lot to the trend;  and we will continue to work on this. </blockquote></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/299620/">https://habr.com/ru/post/299620/</a></p>
