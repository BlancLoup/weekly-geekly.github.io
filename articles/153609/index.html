Nevertheless, if someone finds it interesting, it means not in vain ... Let's go. <br><br><h4>  How it all began </h4><br><br>  Somehow I heard from one person the thought of doing business, he had to ‚Äúgrow <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A1%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F_%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BA%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0_%25D0%2594%25D0%25B6%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0_%25D0%25B8_%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0_%25D0%25A5%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B9%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B0">Mr. Hyde</a> in himself,‚Äù such as some kind of alternative to his personality that he can think of something that he himself cannot think of.  Of course, he was joking for the most part, and then I did not attach any importance to this.  I remembered this exact metaphor only when I myself decided that I need to develop creativity, the ability to productively fantasize, to invent non-standard solutions. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  About the brain and mouse </h4><br>  I reasoned that I needed to start pumping my right hemisphere of the brain.  I read about several techniques, looked at the lectures on TED'e, even took a few steps to develop the motility of the left hand - it is stated that through this there is a stimulation of the right hemisphere, and therefore all the processes for which it is responsible.  Techniques and tips will not describe, only one will focus in detail. <br>  The simplest and at the same time effective was to <b>move the mouse under the left hand</b> .  Why the simplest?  Because this is a one-time action and do not remind yourself.  For example, I did not learn to eat with my left hand, because you remember that you should try to hold a fork or spoon with your left hand only by the end of the meal, if you remember at all.  Why effective?  Because at the computer I (as I think almost all of us) spend most of my time, which means ‚Äúpulling the mouse‚Äù is one of the most frequent motor skills.

      The first clock was very unusual, after a day or two I got comfortable, but getting into small areas, like the cross icon to close the window, was almost unreal.  It took x10 of time to manipulate with the right hand.  ‚ÄúQuickly‚Äù did not work even a month later, but it was already x2 - you can live.  True, there were also side artifacts: the keyboard also had to be moved to the right and with the right hand to get used to ctrl + inst and shift + inst (instead of ctrl + c and ctrl + v) and other hot keys. <br><br><h4>  About the book and drawing </h4><br>  The main direction in this activity was the desire to learn to draw.  I noticed the book a long time ago - <a href="http://www.ozon.ru/context/detail/id/1536309/">Betty Edwards - ‚ÄúDiscover the artist in yourself</a> . <a href="http://www.ozon.ru/context/detail/id/1536309/">‚Äù</a>  First, the praises: the book is cool, everything is on the case, the material is easy, the tasks are in the correct sequence.  Afftor zhzhot!  :) Actually, well done aunty.  In the third chapter, ‚ÄúYour brain: its right and left halves‚Äù is very easily chewed, how the right and left halves of the brain work, how they interact with each other.  Cases of clinical patients were described very interestingly and how people see the brain ‚Äúin one half‚Äù.  In general, I highly recommend the book, even if you don‚Äôt carry out the tasks, but just look through the list to expand your horizons. <br>  And in order not to relax for a long time, the author in the next chapter ‚ÄúTransition: the experience of switching from left to right‚Äù gives a practical task, the implementation of which is aimed at learning to turn off the left hemisphere and go to the right - where all artists live :) since the logic is turned off, I cannot describe them with words, but I am very experienced!  :)) <br><br><h5>  I can not draw </h5><br>  The book said that "anyone can learn to draw."  It was encouraging.  Because I can not draw.  More precisely, how can I not ... Draw symbols, asterisks, stylized letters, tanks, etc.  can, I think everyone.  But it was not a drawing, but rather an algorithm.  If you stick to it, then something will turn out: <br><br><ul><li>  Draw a "&lt;" </li><li>  Draw a "&lt;" right 1 cm </li><li>  Draw "&gt;" to the right 5 cm from the last </li><li>  Connecting straight - <b>turned tank tracks</b> </li><li>  Repeat 1-4 with "(" and ")" immediately above the tracks - it <b>turned out the tank tower</b> </li><li>  Well, etc. </li></ul><br>  And I just wanted to learn how to draw.  And the book really helps in this.  It's time to show pictures: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c98/117/6e4/c981176e4964c559541ba82925460a03.jpg"><br><br>  The first picture that had to be drawn.  I tried very hard.  Here, by the way, I must say that I read it: it was necessary to draw ‚Äúfrom a mirror‚Äù, and I sketched a picture with my own.  As I later read, it is much easier.  To keep the experiment clean the next day I painted a man (he didn‚Äôt know that, by the way) (I was bored already): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/33e/c0b/a6f/33ec0ba6f050df95d758348465f21bec.jpg"><br><br><h5>  About a month of classes </h5><br>  About a month I was studying a book.  It was possible to keep within 1.5-2 weeks, but I initially deliberately chose the ‚Äúlazy‚Äù mode, which restricts reading, when ‚ÄúI need it steadily, but more than I should‚Äù :) It‚Äôs worth saying that because of the good structuring the book can be read selectively.  For example, the chapter about the transition to color was not interesting for me - I wanted to confine myself with a pen or pencil.  I stopped doing exercises about a month later, even though I finished reading a book.  This, of course, does not characterize me with the best hand, but in my defense I can say that the decision to shift the priorities was made for me by my newborn son. <br><br>  Again it's time to show pictures.  Where can we evaluate the progress: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7e9/e43/c14/7e9e43c14986eab73ad98584d240ad07.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/eba/741/9ab/eba7419ab749f97a2179fda9f321a190.jpg"><br>  Drawing becomes quite easy: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ebe/355/359/ebe355359a23bc6c09482e17efa0bfb9.jpg"><br>  Here we draw again, but we play around more when there is less than five minutes of free time: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/386/e1d/19b/386e1d19bb46b6faaee4782195d3de33.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Summarizing </h4><br>  My experiment turned out to be somewhat unfinished, but I understand that if I return to it, it will not be soon.  Therefore, I decided to share what we have.  Unfortunately, there is a problem in order to evaluate the result.  At the very beginning, I did not choose a criterion by which to judge.  But even now I have no idea what to make a measure.  The goal was to develop creativity.  How to measure it?  Creativity of my ideas on average by month increased by 66.47%?  Therefore, everything is very much "on sensations."  Yes, it <b><i>seems to</i></b> me that I have become somewhat wider to look at the world, sometimes from different angles. <br><br>  If I touch on indisputable facts, then I began to draw better, I became a little better able to wield my left hand and foot (I play football).  Well, I stopped seeing aliens in artists.  :) I in no way want to detract from the merits of the people of this profession, do not get me wrong.  At work, my great artists work.  Yes, that's right - great.  What they do is art.  And my ‚Äúmazyuki‚Äù are no match for their work, but now I don‚Äôt feel an inferiority complex when I look at how they work and what happens.  And I believe that drawing is a skill that can be trained, like muscles or the ability to write beautiful code. <br><br>  PS I was not mistaken with the hub?  Correctly understand that the most correct place? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/153609/">https://habr.com/ru/post/153609/</a></p>
