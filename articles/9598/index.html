  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Neighboring Leaders Rush to UANet</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  It has always been interesting to me to observe the exit process of foreign companies that have pretty good positions in their market, in our dear UANet.  But the whole point is that when I was still working in a bigmere, I had such thoughts in my head, but would not the bigmere go, for example, in Poland?  There is an order of magnitude more money than ours.  But the more I look at real examples of such ‚Äúexits‚Äù, the more I convince myself to get rid of such thoughts. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The history of outputs in the examples: <br>  - Rambler.DE <br>  Not quite ours, but it was very revealing how Rambler, inspired by his success in Russia, had come to Germany and it seems still to Bulgaria. <br>  - AtlasUA <br>  In the Czech Republic and Slovakia, they occupy rather serious positions, they say, even MSN stands behind them, who in due time using the ‚Äúexit‚Äù button on the hotmail and unwound them.  We have been able to spend a lot of money in a year and did not achieve anything in the end.  Rumor has it that they want to reanimate the project again. <br>  - Hemius <br>  In Poland and neighboring countries, they occupy very good positions in the market for research of Internet audience sites.  This example, although not completely negative, but for three years I have not yet seen much success in our market.  The process is very slow. <br>  - Pratsyuy <br>  Another Polish leader.  We looked at our market for a long time, eventually bought Jobs.UA, but during that time I did not see any noticeable changes.  In the last design, the Work is simply terrible, I hardly placed a vacancy there and decided not to go there anymore. <br>  - SuperJob.UA <br>  One of the leaders in employment in Russia.  When we still had access to statistics, the Ukrainian audience has very little, so the place in the bigmire that they occupy is not at all the place that there is in reality, if you look at the Ukrainian audience. <br>  - Delfi.ua <br>  In the Baltics, they are in the lead.  Too long looked narrowly at our market.  I recently came out, but with such a site, excuse me, it‚Äôs not that entering the top10 bigmir, as they said in their press release, it will be difficult even in the top100. <br>  - Newsru.ua <br>  I do not know the well-known Russian Newsru.com, what they are counting on, but I think that they will have the same fate as the sites described above. <br><br>  In my opinion, high positions in their home market create with the managers / owners of such companies a certain illusion that they are ‚Äúall knee-deep‚Äù.  Once they enter the market, which is slightly less developed than theirs, they will automatically and automatically become leaders.  They have everything for this: technology, experience, personnel, resources.  But, they lack only the smallest thing they forget about - knowledge of the market and the local mentality of users.  That is what keeps me from marching to neighboring markets.  As time shows, even being in the leaders there are still a lot of niches in which you can successfully develop. </div>
