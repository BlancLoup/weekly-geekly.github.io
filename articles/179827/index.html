  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Exploring SAP R / 3 in Unusual and Difficult Conditions</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Good day, Habra community. <br><br>  I am a beginner SAP consultant of the PM module and I would like to share my experience (and if the article passes through the sandbox, then type in the discussion in the comments) studying the SAP R / 3 ERP system.  My problem was that when I came to the company and, having fallen on probation, I did not receive any applied task.  I had time to get acquainted with the system, a set of courses and a person who occasionally could be tormented by questions.  All this, of course, is wonderful, but it was tantamount to learning to play football on the book.  They even gave the ball.  But not with anyone. <br>  Who cares how to learn to play football alone - please welcome under cat. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  During the first month of my work, I was told that I was enrolled in a conference of young specialists, at which I must submit a project.  They gave me a theme, said "dig from here to dinner."  The topic was ‚ÄúPriority of equipment repair, risk management‚Äù.  For two months I have been studying the literature persistently, looking at presentations, developing algorithms for analyzing and predicting the condition of equipment, evaluating risks and generating matrices, prioritizing repairs, etc.  In general, I did everything, but not SAP R / 3.  The time has come for the conference, the result did not meet the expectations due to some reasons, but I was not particularly upset. <br><br>  The conference is, of course, wonderful, but I realized that in 3 months of work I had hardly made any progress in the knowledge of SAP R / 3.  No, I knew how all the main components work, some of their properties and settings (I say some, for there are darkness, especially settings), but this was extremely small.  Mostly this was theoretical knowledge.  I decided it was time to change something.  A practical task on the horizon was not planned and it is necessary to take matters into your own hands.  I have been doing programming for a long time and decided that I would go along the same lines: I would set myself a simple task and solve it.  And not here it was.  If studying programming, you can start by writing a calculator, the functionality of which perfectly imagines everything to you, then here I am very poorly aware of the possibilities of the functionality of the module supported by me.

      And then I went on a journey through the expanses of the Internet in search of methods of study.  I wandered through the forums (mostly sapboard.ru);  I read all the literature I could get;  actively communicated with experts, to which he could reach.  Everything was stuck in the formulation of the problem.  And in another gloomy winter day it dawned on me.  Forum - a storehouse of unsolved problems.  I started small: object configuration.  When changing the attribute value, the object specification was changed.  It seems nothing complicated, but not as simple as it would seem (I repeat that the complexity lies in the abundance of settings).  After spending a few days on this, eventually getting the desired result, I began to shovel all the tasks from the topics I had just seen.  Here it is necessary to understand and take into account the nuance: the task can be quite narrow and be carried out within the framework of the implemented project, which I, of course, have not implemented (someone would have realized it) and therefore you can lean against the wall.  In the end, my training went uphill.  In the process, I came across a compilation of TK, where there were simple tasks (for the sake of consolidating and systematizing the knowledge I implemented them too), and quite complex tasks that could not be solved with the help of standard functionality.  At the moment I continue to "solve" this collection and, I will tell you, progress is obvious. <br><br>  To summarize: if you encounter a problem similar to mine, your way out is other people's tasks.  It is desirable that they should be compiled even humanly, otherwise there is a chance to get seriously confused and, wandering in darkness, you just lose time.  Also, if there are specific tasks on the production client, I advise you to pay attention to them and, if possible, try to implement them on the development mandate. <br><br>  PS: One person gave me a cool tip: if you can‚Äôt find a property / setting / etc., Don‚Äôt rush to go to the forum and coat it.  Dig yourself to the end and find in the process a lot of things that will come in handy in the future. <br><br>  Thanks for attention. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/179827/">https://habr.com/ru/post/179827/</a></p>
