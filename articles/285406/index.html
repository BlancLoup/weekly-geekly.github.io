Management companies from the ‚Äúmarket‚Äù have leaked into your company, who have no idea what effective work with the creative intelligentsia is, and they continue to sell potatoes out of the habit and bring cheap dildos to you and the management.

      Then it will only get worse, you can not lose time and it's time to prepare for a coup. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <i>ProductOwner from the market:</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/f70/756/101/f70756101fb752f69f2ad2c5d95c703d.jpg" alt="image" width="30%" align="right"><br><br>  <b>We are familiar with the path of a typical Programmer, remember it ...</b> <br><br>  <i>The beginning of the way</i> <br><br>  Some, especially gifted individuals, begin to write code in high school, some are involved in development projects in their student years.  But the most active phase of the acquisition and application of knowledge in practice begins after graduation. <br><br>  <i>First projects and teams</i> <br><br>  For the first time, developers encounter large systems and, in practice, comprehend why they need to leave comments in the code, observe modularity, write automated tests.  Large projects are actively re-evaluating academic knowledge, especially in the field of object-oriented programming. <br><br>  Important is the experience gained in the course of working in a team of programmers.  It is necessary to get used to the fact that there are more experienced and clever colleagues, there are beginners, there are untidy ones - you need to suppress disgust for someone else's, especially poor-quality code - and this is not easy. <br><br>  It takes a lot of time to master the comfortable tactics of working with command tools (trackers, version control systems).  And the tools in different teams are different, you have to relearn. <br><br>  <i>First libraries</i> <br><br>  I noticed that there are few developers capable of creating high-quality libraries.  One out of ten, maybe less.  I think due to the fact that it requires an understanding of the REASONS of the emergence of modularity, the concepts of OOP and the internal, and not the "syntactic" comprehension of patterns.  If you managed to confuse in the past and fill it up with a couple of projects - experience will come in handy.  And if you sat on the support / revision of the ... year code, even better. <br><br>  <i>Understanding relational theory ... in practice</i> <br><br>  Here the specialist will not interfere with design experience and then support projects with intensive use of databases.  I was surprised to find that people seem to be able to program, but they cannot explain the solution of the problem in terms of relational algebra :-) We need practice and reading books ‚Äî thick but interesting.  More time. <br><br>  <i>Broadening horizons</i> <br><br>  Sometimes there are developers learning at the same time competing technology - to better understand the core.  Met such pairs: java - c #, java - php.  Really useful practice. <br><br>  <i>Narrow specialization</i> <br><br>  And technologies tend to thrive.  Take javascript.  Not only is the language ‚Äúspecial‚Äù in itself (one model of <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B5_%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B8%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5">prototype inheritance</a> and closures is worth it), it is also a dog that works differently in different browsers.  And in order to professionally solve tasks on it - IMHO must be hung daily on specialized forums, study the differences, read articles - in general, keep yourself in shape.  The situation is similar with other popular technologies. <br><br>  <i>Back to basics</i> <br><br>  And if you are intensely drawn to the "basics", whence everything went - Unix, C and system programming, then it will definitely take the next couple of years of evenings :-) <br><br>  In general, the older you are, the deeper you dig, you specialize, you begin to understand the concepts of the OOP from within, you already agree with several programming patterns, perfect your skills and see what else you can learn. <br><br>  Ops, the developer is already 30, and to whom, and under 40 years.  And there is so much more interesting ahead! <br><br>  <i>Plans for the future - narrow specialization, expertise</i> <br><br>  Experts understand that the way to managers is fraught with rapid loss of skills and the acquisition of fighting knowledge of survival in analog systems - countering trolling, intrigue, envy and other spiritual and moral feces, far from slender matmodels, OOP and design patterns :-). <br><br>  Therefore, it is better to continue pumping and growing in the direction of an expert with narrow qualifications.  Developing experts can actually earn at a little slightly lower than top managers in certain types of companies.  Not bad and without dirt. <br><br>  <i>Ideal Specialist Working Day</i> <br><br>  You come to understand that you need to view technological news every day, at least an hour, to be aware of events.  It is also a good idea to use another hour for immersion "in depth" - repeat the types of joins, explore the subtleties of MySQL replication, understand and test the keys of the top command ;-) <br><br>  <i>Whack - forced profanation</i> <br><br>  Yeah, we got to the topic of the article.  The stupid management from the market refuses to understand how a programmer, sitting at the console for the last 10 years, cannot deal with the subtleties of the Oracle database in the evening, if he has optimized queries from the MySQL database last week?  Or why a programmer working on PHP for the last 5 years and creating excellent libraries is horrified when he tries to create javascript code that is portable between browsers. <br><br>  People do not understand what makes the Specialist engage in PROFANATION, working on the technology that is little known to him, taking sin on his soul :-) <br><br>  <b>What to do?</b> <br><br>  IMHO, this often happens in our domestic companies and this is due to illiterate management, managing high-tech specialists. <br><br><img src="http://gazeta.ua/img/gallery/218/218326_1_300.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Managers need to be taught in courses, how to manage IT, damn it, and not to recruit people from the street and put them on the head of professionals - ‚Äúyou know how to scream and you know how to enter the browser, then you will be our project manager.‚Äù <br><br>  The case may take an even more sad turn.  ‚ÄúCheap‚Äù management from the market, feeling its professional unsuitability, poorly developed brain (in contrast to the brains of specialists) with strong ambitions and a sense of the illusion of power - begins to simply hate developers and troll madly. <br><br>  What to do.  Fight these werewolf-managers.  Expose them to fools on PlanningPoker and functional demonstrations.  Connect adequate IT companies: tehdir, hands.  development - it is not too late to build an open and formal business process in which the dullness and inexperience of project / product management will be visible to company management. <br><br>  At least the processes will become less emotional, predictable, more independent of market phrases ‚ÄúI need a website launch in a week,‚Äù ‚ÄúI will fire you,‚Äù ‚ÄúI will find a student for five hundred bucks that works faster.‚Äù <br><br>  If nothing happens, do not lose hope and try to find a company in which you want to work for many years, improving your skills and giving yourself to her. <br><br>  All developers sincerely wish good luck and energy in self-realization. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/285406/">https://habr.com/ru/post/285406/</a></p>
