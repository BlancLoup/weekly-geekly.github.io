      We hope that this will be useful to you.  Video analysis 7 real situation - under the cut: <br><ul><li>  “To freedom - with ready reporting!” </li><li>  “4 hours to make the client rubbish” </li><li>  “Mission Impossible (with this equipment)” </li><li>  “Start work, after 14 hours of opening the store” </li><li>  “Our budget is 3 times less” </li><li>  “Unplanned Rollback” </li><li>  “If you have a hammer in your hands, everything seems to be a nail” </li></ul><br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h5>  Situation “To freedom - with ready reporting” </h5><br>  Work was carried out at the client - an ordinary departure.  The essence is the correction of data.  At 20 o'clock in the evening, the client declares: “Well, I have gone, now you will be locked up, so that by morning the data will be normal, otherwise I will have to submit reports ...” How to react to this? <br><br><iframe src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://player.vimeo.com/video/91408716&amp;xid=17259,1500000,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgcfrCpquHL4pPAcI3lxsppF_5Mag" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" title="Situation &quot;To freedom - with ready reporting&quot;" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h5>  Situation “4 hours to make the client nonsense, which he wants, not realizing that this is nonsense” </h5><br>  An employee has been working with a client for a long time - a project of maintenance and sluggish development.  The client’s management changed (before that, they didn’t communicate with the management as a matter of fact, only with a functional customer), and about a week after that an employee, who this evening gets on the train and goes on vacation, calls me (the project manager) with tears “I’m new General does not let go until I do as he wants.  And he wants nonsense, and even make this nonsense a few days. ”  It was 4 hours before the train ... <br><br><iframe src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://player.vimeo.com/video/91408831&amp;xid=17259,1500000,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhi_rgdyUzZY-8L0RR2PZTkfN2S26g" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" title="Situation &quot;4 hours to make the client nonsense&quot;" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h5>  Situation “Mission Impossible with this equipment” </h5><br>  The sales employee did not clarify the requirements for equipment and networks and customer compliance.  The result is that it is physically impossible to deliver in the horizon that the customer saw (50 workstations in the office + about 30 stores).  Specific trading equipment layered here - there were no drivers for our system at that time. <br><br><iframe src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://player.vimeo.com/video/91408935&amp;xid=17259,1500000,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjy_-SLGCQTL8xFLKas4FQ7pf_0dw" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" title="Situation &quot;Mission Impossible (with this equipment)&quot;" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h5>  Situation “Start work, after 14 hours of opening the store” </h5><br>  Opening a grocery store (20 cash desks - to understand about the volume).  The fault of the customer himself - there were problems with the areas, repairs, electricity, the purchase of maintenance ... it was not possible to adjust the commercial equipment on site. <br><br>  At hour X, the Customer completes the electricity and gives the repair team and the control center to us: so that after 14 hours everything will be finished, I’m supposedly opening the store tomorrow for visitors.  Aggravating conditions: the date was indeed spelled out in the contract with our financial responsibility, the obligations of the customer were written poorly, there is nothing to cling to. <br><br><iframe src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://player.vimeo.com/video/91409052&amp;xid=17259,1500000,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhi5BOAwE59VH_8xQEqYmfJZ-7OeMw" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" title="Situation &quot;Start work, after 14 hours of opening the store&quot;" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h5>  Situation “Our budget is 3 times less” </h5><br>  The customer (tasty, good, with a big name) wants the N-th number of works.  They were rated, directed by KP. <br><br>  When protecting a KP at a meeting with the Customer (a wide range of persons with the participation of a person having the right of signature), the purchaser on their part says “so much money is pledged” - 3.5 times less than we counted, and obviously does not even cover the cost of the project .  But either this or that, because the budgets are agreed.  Add.  introductory - the person with the right to sign at this moment is silent and with interest “scans” our team. <br><br>  Resources for the preparation of projects have already been invested, the project is very interesting and there is a desire to subscribe to it.  But you still need to perform with the stated budget, in extreme cases, with a 10-20% discount.  But not 3.5 times less. <br><br>  Usually experienced negotiators in such cases operate with the content of the project.  “Do you need 3.5 times cheaper?  Let us then make only points 1,2,7 and 28, and the rest - when the money comes. "  Are there any other recommendations besides truncating the content of the project? <br><br><iframe src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://player.vimeo.com/video/91409136&amp;xid=17259,1500000,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhg-OHzNhZgSmttj_A1SfziQ1V9jfQ" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" title="Situation &quot;Our budget is 3 times less&quot;" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h5>  Situation “Unplanned Rollback” </h5><br>  The representative of the Customer invited us to a closed competition, providing access to it.  In the framework of the preliminary talks, he stated his interest as “you are doing well for the company, I personally do not need anything.”  As a result, in a closed tender, we encountered other interested parties who were pushing through their contractor. <br><br>  Our kung fu turned out to be stronger, the competition was won (although it had to fall below the cost we expected), the contract was signed.  The person who invited us asks for a meeting and reports that there are interests within the company and for the success of the project it is necessary to share ~ 25% of the budget. <br><br>  In preparing the project presentation, the budget already has all the planned costs, and 25% of the rollback is an unacceptable level of add.  expenses.  If you agree - the project is unprofitable.  To refuse is already impossible. <br><br><iframe src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://player.vimeo.com/video/91409224&amp;xid=17259,1500000,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhj0eQ0H4Xk-y2loLBIBBwyzwV9iew" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" title="Unplanned Rollback Situation" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h5>  Situation “If you have a hammer in your hands, everything around seems like a nail” </h5><br>  Business 1C franchisee is very hard typed, formalized and painted with instructions, techniques and best practices.  In addition, the product structure itself implies “typical implementations” in very similar business situations. <br><br>  A consultant comes to the organization, and having heard only one key phrase (“For example, I don’t have any goods in stock, and there are only a penny left on the card” - a typical situation with a typical decision for consideration) do not listen to customers.  Because the situation for the consultant is typical, template.  But the client is the first, he wants to be heard.  And he is answered - give money, let us go to the computer and do not interfere. <br><iframe src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://player.vimeo.com/video/91409332&amp;xid=17259,1500000,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhj7l_JWxxU_n8zASimiFRj175uXkQ" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" title="Situation &quot;If you have a hammer in your hands, everything seems like a nail&quot;" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h5>  At last </h5><br>  Friends, analyzes of such situations will be included in our new program <a href="http://www.stratoplan.ru/ngt/formula/">“Formula Negotiations”</a> , which will start from April 15.  Among other things, we are going to sort out the listening situations of the participants there. <br><br>  In addition to the fact that, of course, we will be glad to see you there, we will also be grateful for the feedback.  We plan to analyze the situation according to the algorithm: <br><ul><li>  Description of the problem from the point of view of the theory of negotiations (“Colleagues, we are dealing with the diagnosis No. 100508”) </li><li>  The first decision is how to get out of the current situation without solving it directly. </li><li>  The second solution, “Coldrex for the negotiator,” is a symptomatic solution to the situation.  How to solve the situation for the night / half an hour / standing at the blackboard, etc.  May not be a decision in essence, but it helps to alleviate the suffering of negotiators. </li><li>  The third solution is transformational.  In principle, not applicable “for the night, one hour before”.  But shows the student - where to go, so as not to fall into such situations in principle. </li></ul><br><br>  How interesting are such analyzes, useful?  What to add, what to deploy, etc.  We would be grateful for the feedback. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/218745/">https://habr.com/ru/post/218745/</a></p>
