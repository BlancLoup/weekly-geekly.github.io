Preschooler  From year to seven.  And maybe even younger than a year.  What is he or she?  And what are they, modern children?  Advanced, well-versed in the latest toys, able to give a head start in this matter to many adults.  What is their favorite entertainment?  Mobile phones, computers, consoles.  After all, yours, for sure, will not let go of the small hands of the iPad, if you give it to him.  The main thing is that they don‚Äôt throw themselves into the wall :) <br><br>  Now let's look at the other side.  In psychology, there is such a thing as "leading activity".  This is the activity during which the psyche of the child develops at one or another stage of its formation.  As it is not difficult to guess, for children of preschool age this is definitely a game.  Freely developing activities undertaken for the pleasure of the process itself, and not of the result. <br><br>  How to make it so that in the course of the game, not for the sake of learning, but for the sake of pleasure (do not forget that this is what motivates the young child in the first place to play a particular game), our kids get useful information?

      We found the answer to this question, which certainly worries all modern parents, and created a colorful educational application developed for the iPhone and iPad especially for kids who are just starting to get acquainted with the alphabet.  <a href="http://frd.io/15k">Bukvario</a> is an electronic interactive alphabet. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/d444c59b/0104649e/31b398e5/f312035c.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Where is the miracle from? </h4><br>  The son of project manager Sergey Pimenov Sasha discovered papin's iPhone and iPad when he was five months old.  Sasha‚Äôs interest in these beautiful instruments has not waned, so the caring father decided to turn the baby‚Äôs acquaintance with the fruits of technological progress into a pleasant and rewarding pastime.  Having bought all the good foreign children's programs in the appstore, Sergey became convinced of the need for Russian analogues, since it was obvious that the little son could speak in English earlier than in his native language.  So the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Russian educational project Bukvario appeared. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/52192afa/ddd8c6f1/bfb9f2bc/6e76a949.jpg"><br><br><h4>  The Scarlet Flower </h4><br>  So what is <a href="http://frd.io/15k">Bukvario</a> ?  For a child who is just beginning to recognize the language, this is a colorful and fascinating e-book with an intuitive, extremely simple control, and the settings of the program, which are contained in the appendix of a huge selection, give parents complete control over the process of learning the alphabet. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/92cc0eaa/625d4dc5/dda7e0d3/b41f3f2e.jpg"><br><br>  In addition to all this pleasure - a great realization of the very acquaintance with the letters.  Each letter is beautifully decorated and has a corresponding image of the animal and high-quality sound.  And!  The card can easily ‚Äúspeak‚Äù in my mother‚Äôs or father‚Äôs voice, if they independently voice it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/2827980a/6134b1ce/dc0eff2c/bd320f00.jpg"><br><br>  For better memorization, memory checking and correct pronunciation of letters by a child, you can shuffle the cards or turn off the pronunciation of the letters and names of animals in the settings. <br><br><h4>  What's next? </h4><br>  We do not stand still!  Constantly there are updates in which more and more new ideas are implemented.  In the original version, all the animals for the alphabet were drawn, now the long-awaited set with high-quality photos of animals on each letter of the alphabet is added.  The next step will be HD video, when on the screen the baby will see, for example, a hippopotamus, click on the screen and the hippopotamus will begin to move. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/08368868/59eb9572/56ffbf75/8fefc6bf.jpg"><br><br>  In addition, we plan to transfer our developments to the Android platform, as well as continue the further development of not only our alphabet (in the project of the ‚ÄúFigures‚Äù, ‚ÄúCities of Russia‚Äù, ‚ÄúAnimals of Russia‚Äù series, ‚ÄúMathematics‚Äù and a number of others), but also create New educational games and programs for children 1-7 years old in Russian. <br><br><h4>  Instead of the total </h4><br>  Today, our team employs professional children's artists, musicians, developers and designers, plus we are constantly looking for "talents" who are able to bring new ideas to our diverse project.  We do everything to hear only positive feedback from our users and bring joy to them and their kids. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/b9afed53/ef07d248/a244b38e/ad1fa2f1.png"><br><br>  It is worth noting that in spite of the fact that <a href="http://www.bookvar.io/">Bukvario</a> "found life" only in November 2010, today we have more than 3000 downloads. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/c79a71b5/5b4c1445/a462e212/e2473c43.png"><br><br>  Best of all, our application is downloaded not only in Russia, although, of course, most of it falls on it - because the application is Russian-language and is designed specifically for learning the Russian language.  Nevertheless, statistics show that they are interested in the application in other countries as well. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/87b4709c/e74ba4ae/5acb699e/1ba7a419.png"><br><br>  If you have interesting and sensible thoughts on how to <a href="http://www.bookvar.io/">improve Bukvario</a> , or you would like to take one of the available <a href="http://www.bookvar.io/about/">vacancies in the project</a> - write us at pimenov@ppk.ru <br><br>  We are looking for cooperation with interested parents, as well as looking for investors for our children's applications.  The address for the letters is the same: pimenov@ppk.ru <br><br><h4>  Instead of postscript </h4><br>  We did not think long about how to please the audience Habrahabr in honor of our first post.  You will find 50 promotional codes for getting the app just below, in the first comment. <br><br>  And remember, the game is the best way to learn for kids. <br>  Team <a href="http://www.bookvar.io/">Bukvario</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/118093/">https://habr.com/ru/post/118093/</a></p>
