      I wake up at one o'clock.  I slept, what a nightmare!  Grab the keys and rush to the subway.  ‚ÄúIt is forbidden to take photo and video in the auditorium.  Disable mobile phones for the duration of the session.  Enjoy watching".  Fuh, had time.  In the working chatika going for lunch.  Oh, guys, poor things are tired, horses are working.  I turn off the phone. <br><br>  Total euphoria, ambitious plans, endless lists of "where to go," "what to see," "what to read."  Finally, there is time for all your Wishlist.  I sleep until dinner, the torrent works non-stop, I non-stop looking up.  Too good to be true. <br><br><h1>  Waiting and reality </h1><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/bb/tw/5a/bbtw5avq4h-muc9jz-sbiumzife.png"><br><br>  Books have been read, games have been played, notes have been learned, all the bars have been studied, ideas have ended, enthusiasm has disappeared.  Laziness, loneliness, bytovuha and complete discord.  I put off so much because of work, but there is nothing to do.  I have many friends, I am free on any given day, and there is nobody to go for a walk.  I can write articles, study, travel, but I sit at home and watch TV shows.  Something went wrong?  What am I mistaken? <br><br><h2>  No job no problem </h2><br>  <strong>Expectation.</strong>  No more deadlines, scheduling, hotfixes and falling tests. <br><br>  <strong>Reality.</strong>  Feel worthless.  Nobody needs my knowledge and experience.  I do not improve or create anything.  In working chats, life is in full swing, the fate of entire services is decided, the guys go to conferences, go to Bartschay on Fridays.  And I do not go further Pyaterochka.  Bonus get the fear of being out of money.  Oh yeah, and no more eatery: if you want to eat, learn to cook. <br><br><h2>  There will be time wagon </h2><br>  <strong>Expectation.</strong>  I will redo a lot of cases, I will have time to do everything. <br><br>  <strong>Reality.</strong>  The lack of a time frame makes it necessary to allocate more time to tasks than is required.  Inefficient allocation of resources depresses.  Still not in time.  All the free time goes into the pipe: half the time is consumed by bytes, half the time is just laziness.  The routine at work was replaced by a domestic routine.  Cleaning, cooking, search for discounts in the store, a trip to Ikea, cleaning, cooking.  Why am I doing such a garbage?  Spending time on it just because it is.  I do not sleep well: I spend little energy and hardly fall asleep, or I go to bed at night and do not even lie down.  Lack of mode knocks out of a rut.  I eat at night and actively gaining extra weight.  I do not know what day it is.  I do not remember what I did yesterday.  Every useless day I justify with a quote from BoJack: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gh/c6/f_/ghc6f_fvozlucfqsf8achwywqim.png"><br><br>  <font color="grey"><i>‚ÄúThe universe is a brutal and indifferent vacuum.</i></font>  <font color="grey"><i>The key to happiness is not a search for meaning.</i></font>  <font color="grey"><i>It's just a matter of meaningless trivial things until you die in the end. ‚Äù</i></font> <br><br><h2>  I will meet with friends, stay with loved ones </h2><br>  <strong>Expectation.</strong>  I will hang out with friends all day, spend more time with my family. <br><br>  <strong>Reality.</strong>  Sonia is free on Wednesdays, Katya - only on weekends, and Andrei does not even know in advance.  As a result, we meet once a month for half an hour.  With relatives more difficult.  Everybody works and gets tired in the family, and only I have a lot of time for personal affairs.  And even if you send your relatives on the same indefinite vacation, what chance would they choose to go with me to the bay or to the concert, and not to stick to the new season of the Game of Thrones?  I managed to visit family and friends in my hometown, but most of the time I just waited for them from work.  I can arrange a booze party any day, but still wait for the weekend, because only on weekends can I do it with friends. <br><br><h2>  I will do everything that put off </h2><br>  <strong>Expectation.</strong>  I'll go to the sea, learn English, learn to paint in oils, start going to the pool, take care of my health, read all those books. <br><br>  <strong>Reality.</strong>  I am not going to the sea - the idea lost its relevance when my brains were caked from the summer heat.  I do not learn English because there is no need to upgrade.  Although the 7 Harry Potter books in the original have contributed.  I do not paint with oil and do not go to the pool - this is not what I want to spend my time on.  Going to the doctors turned into an endless quest with meaningless diagnoses.  I found out that I didn‚Äôt put things off because of work, they were just uninteresting or unimportant.  It turned out that, apart from work, I have few hobbies, and I don‚Äôt need to devote a separate day or month to them.  It is enough to stop working for 12 hours and dilute working life with a good book or going to the cinema, without trying to cram all the joys of life into your precious day off.  Any rest is more pleasant when it is deserved, as food is tastier when you are hungry.  And after a fight with the manager for the allocation of resources to refactor a special thrill to come home, go into the game and scatter all the bosses. <br><br><h2>  I will pump skills, learn new </h2><br>  <strong>Expectation.</strong>  I will learn a new language, finish pet-projects, start contributing to open source. <br><br>  <strong>Reality.</strong>  Programming?  What is programming?  Oh, "Slay the spire" is released!  Buy, download, play, do not get bored. <br><br>  The first six months, the thought of programming was painful.  This is called burnout.  At work, I took on many routine tasks and lost the ability and desire to dive deep into the engineered logic, work through the architecture, conduct research.  I stopped programming unicorns, started programming mediocre horses and quickly got fed up with it.  I was not smart enough to switch to other tasks or stop hanging around in the office for 12 hours, and I gradually became disappointed in what I was doing.  I quit, but the thought that programming was boring kept in my head for another six months. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pu/3i/xv/pu3ixvyofzfw-arxvzaw7rbizqu.png"><br><br>  After another couple of months I didn‚Äôt turn up my nose, but I didn‚Äôt show much interest either.  At work, we discuss technologies, share ideas, inspire each other.  Looking up from the community, I fell out of context and lost interest in what was happening in IT.  But it showed a close friend.  He passed the qualifying stage in School 21 and went to Moscow to become a programmer.  I had to keep up.  At first she advised him books and articles, then she re-read these books and articles.  Interest came back, it was only worth starting.  The desire to develop and move mountains has returned.  Returned desire to work.  I realized that it was more interesting to study among like-minded people: you can discuss the material with them and understand it more deeply, they will give up ideas and will not allow them to be abandoned.  And colleagues coped with this role perfectly.  I was glad to work with you guys! <br><br><h1>  It was worth it </h1><br>  Nothing to regret.  I read three dozen books, moved to Moscow, slept 10 years in advance, and learned a lot about myself.  I am not a rider in Europe, not a businessman, not a volunteer, I have no children and there were no hobbies for which I wanted to leave work early.  And instead of looking for new sources of self-realization, I devoted myself to work.  I lived by work.  There were all my friends and the whole movement.  I understood why I could not comprehend work-life balance.  My life revolved around work.  Work has become life.  I worked for 12 hours not because I was thrilled, but because 4 more hours of work led me to some goal, and the same 4 hours outside the office did not lead.  I was not embarrassed that, apart from a pile of books, nothing brings home.  What seemed important was not interesting, and everything interesting seemed unimportant.  I thought I wanted to travel, but I never monitored Aviasales.  I thought I wanted to learn English, but I never bought a textbook.  I wanted to play Skyrim and paint anti-stress coloring, but when the terms are burning (and they are always burning), who need coloring, it's so unimportant, so corny.  And I burned before the deadlines burned, because the coloring pages were anti-stress. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">If more than a year did not go on vacation</b> <div class="spoiler_text"> You are either a successful and happy person, or it is a disturbing bell.  I am inspired by people who can work without holidays.  They know how to relax qualitatively in 2-3 days on holidays: go around several countries or round up to the festival, put together a computer or go to Siberia for fishing.  They and working days are diluted with conferences and organization of meetings to the department.  They do not go on vacation, escaping from the routine and harmful managers.  If you, like me, do not belong to these people, it is better to go on vacation.  Vacation is overload control.  Do not save days for the sake of payments after leaving - a pleasant thing, but disposable.  Do not rush to blame the evil manager who did not let him - look for a compromise, warn in advance.  Rest at home if you do not have time to plan your trip.  Choose a <a href="https://zen.yandex.ru/media/yamoney/kogda-vygodnee-uhodit-v-otpusk-5c41b799779cae00ab29b4a1">suitable period</a> if you do not want to lose a lot of money.  Do not underestimate the power of life-giving leave.  If you still prefer to work hard without the right to rest, I hope you have a worthy goal.  <i>‚ÄúIdentify for yourself the criterion of success.</i>  <i>Otherwise, you are just a bloody workaholic. ‚Äù(‚Äú Business as a game. Russian business rakes and unexpected decisions ‚Äù)</i> </div></div><br>  Excessive hard work will require unduly hard rest.  Do what you like right now.  No time?  There will never be time, even in retirement.  The quality of rest is more important than its quantity.  Have nothing to do?  Try new, broaden your horizons, look for interesting people and, perhaps, you divide their interests. <br><br>  Take care of yourself. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/459262/">https://habr.com/ru/post/459262/</a></p>
