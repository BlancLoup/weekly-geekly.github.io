How to enter the apartment without any extra people?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> Thank you so much for your <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/ip-concierge/blog/275426/">welcome</a> on this resource.  We did not expect such an interest in the field of private security.  In general, they planned to limit themselves to one article.  But people just tore us up for questioning, which indicates a lively interest in this topic.  And, as they say, at your request, we continue the cycle of ideas about improvised ways to survive in this world, it is clear what kind. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The first thing to begin with is to apologize for our arrogance on the publication of criminal statistics.  Already the first discussions showed that it is individual for people, each evaluates their own specifics in their own way, and it is rather silly to talk about the average temperature in the hospital.  We will never prove to a person from the panel five-story building that unlawful actions are also being committed in the elevator.  We use better the old proven tool - public data of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation.  And we will try to softer the horror stories of our reality.  But just try. <br><br>  According to official statistics, about 100,000 robberies and robberies are committed in Russia every year.  More than half of them are in the private sector, i.e.  robbing houses and apartments.  In fact, this is not much, if one considers that theft is more than a million crimes per year, moreover, out of two million of all other registered cases.  If you live or already live a long life, then the likelihood that you are not robbed or have not been robbed is extremely small.  You see, we are already trying to use frightening phrases like ‚Äúextremely small‚Äù instead of saying that you are doomed to robbing in our country fatally. <br><br>  We will also try to reassure: nevertheless, theft is not such a terrible phenomenon as compared with robberies, which often cause problems with the life and health of citizens, and their consequences are thousands of times heavier.  Only ONE MILLION robbery per decade.  If you live 70 years, that is only 5% that you will be robbed during your life.  And even less, considering that some (someone else) are robbed several times.  If this situation calms you down, then there is no need to read further this article.

      We will not give our own statistics on how many crimes are committed by entering the apartment on the owner‚Äôs shoulders, for any statistic is noodles for each individual.  As they say, there is a lie, a frank lie and statistics.  We'd better say the truth - such cases are HAPPENING, as they say in the Holy Land, and this statement is difficult to refute.  Among all kinds of robbery, a private dwelling continues to remain a tasty morsel of criminals.  You will not take a lot from a person on the street, there is security in the offices, and in the apartment, and with the landlord you will neither have any witnesses, nor the time pressure, nor the efforts to search - he will give everything.  Yes, and break-open nothing, if you have time to attack at the moment when the door is open. <br><br>  We hope that our arguments are enough to pay attention to the process of entering and leaving the house?  If someone does not want to do it himself, welcome to our <a href="http://ip-concierge.com/">IP Concierge service</a> !  For those who are not ready to trust in outsourcing in safety, we will share some simple methods of its provision. <br><br>  Last time <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/ip-concierge/blog/275426/">we wrote</a> how to turn an ordinary motion sensor into a presence sensor, which indicates a potential danger when leaving the apartment.  This time we will tell you how to use the same sensor for a more or less safe INPUT. <br><br>  We open the case, turn off the sensor's own LED from its standard circuit, and connect it to ours ‚Äî the one already described, which gets an indication inside the apartment.  But at the same time (and the whole essence of the article in this sentence) we put a delay of 10 seconds on the first actuation.  (Only for the external indicator.) Thus, when approaching your apartment, if you are the first to arrive in the last 10 minutes, the sensor indicator does not immediately trigger on you, and you see an extinct state.  This fact indicates that no one was here nearby. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/11d/199/8f0/11d1998f0ceb4f40a336d80246038b73.jpg"><br><br>  After 10 seconds, the display, as expected, lights up, but it should not bother you anymore if it was not at the time of approach.  If, on your appearance in front of the apartment, the LED (as if it was a regular one) is already flashing, it means that you have already had some kind of ‚Äúfirst‚Äù one.  Caution - danger! <br><br>  Naturally, it is naive to believe that the threat is 100% real, a neighbor could have passed 5 minutes ago.  This is just a warning, and who is warned, that ... If the yellow permitted traffic signal flashes at a crossroad or a pedestrian crossing, this does not mean that a car is going there or a person is walking along the road.  Any logical reflection on this topic will lead to the assertion of the senselessness of this device.  But since the warning signals on the roads around the world light up, it means that someone needs it! <br><br>  Such a cheap simple device as a presence sensor in front of an apartment gives the brain a warning signal of potential danger, that's all.  It is up to the driver (sorry, owner) to decide whether to pay attention to him.  Although, unlike a traffic light, the presence sensor blinks not from scratch. <br><br>  Well, and finally, one more practically free technology, how to enter the apartment without any extra people.  Police operatives and our observations have long noticed that no one attacks a person until the door is open.  Just no one needs surprises.  The master can lock the lock, he can forget or insert another key, the door is sometimes unlocked in a complicated way and so on.  Remember the rule: <b>When entering the apartment you are safe while the front door is closed!</b> <b><br></b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cd6/e0e/d29/cd6e0ed29c614ecc82f5936e6148dd42.jpg"><br><br>  Use this rule to the fullest.  They heard a rustle, saw a man walking nearby, an elevator stopped on your floor ... - do not unlock the door.  Look for the key, pretend that you forgot it, make a phone call ... but do not open the door, even if you managed to unlock it. <br><br>  It‚Äôs a typical mistake when people, seeing strangers, on the contrary try to get to their place faster, but attackers read the seconds well - you don‚Äôt have time. <br><br>  PS: We remember that you asked to show the criminal moments of our records.  Now we are coordinating this issue with our management.  In the next article we will definitely answer it.  Positive or negative, but we will respond. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/394061/">https://habr.com/ru/post/394061/</a></p>
