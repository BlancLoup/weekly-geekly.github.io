Habitually earned the thought: ‚ÄúIs it possible to <s>catch a cheat and get</s> out without <s>getting caught</s> ?‚Äù <s>They estimated the</s> size of the data - a hundred meg per day, rarely when the gig accumulates.  Ready project going into circulation - somewhere ten GB of any files, several.  once a month - everything is there: drawings in CAD and pdf, and directly programs for machine tools in g-codes, and various technological maps, specifications with specific articles of suppliers, Gant charts, credentials, correspondence with approval, a photo of the test copy ... right up to ‚Äúcollect the left first, for the opposite will be inconvenient (catch the small screw with the left hand)‚Äù (everything that relates to each specific project is going to be in one place) ... <br><br>  Yes, even 10G per day is even on a flash drive, but you need a completely "self-working" solution, because we know, we know: forgot, gave, washed it down ... with the ends.

      <s>People are divided into those who row and those who have a revolver.</s>  There are two forms of data integrity: from their unrighteous - death and reproduction. <br>  Due to <div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">market features</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  where everyone knows everything - the base of contacts and prices, including the cost of contracts - is essentially open (tenders, etc.) i.  "Data runaway" together with the manager - not dangerous </div></div>  and <div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">the firm itself</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  (not so much a family business, but something like - people have been working together for 10-15 years already, almost all have given their children work - correspondingly, they all pain-less understand that any large purchase is from the payroll it takes money, for there is no place to come. No, no, not democracy at all, but a consumer attitude to the ‚Äúbudget‚Äù like ‚Äúgive me a good comp and a salary, and then I will give the result‚Äù - not at all) <div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">(It has long been)</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  The designer bent his fingers - they say, the computer is slowing down ... they asked him to give out the specification of what he thinks he should work just right.  He issued, incidentally quarreling with evil admin.  Not a problem - you are an expert, it's up to you, here's 120t.r.  cash, buy yourself a computer, what you think is necessary.  In the fall.  Under NG, we conducted an audit of iron and, of course, the computer in real life was not on 120yr, but up to 50 inadequate.  Presented, asked to return the difference to the cashier.  Returned.  It works, because the designer is, in general, excellent, he wins tenders and his fingers are no longer oppressed - I studied the v-ray settings and didn‚Äôt buzz, for it‚Äôs not only in <s>parrots</s> that the matter is cool.) </div></div></div></div>  ... found out that we are worried about the first incarnation - damage, loss of data due to crypto-fiber or physical damage / theft / seizure of computers, incl.  security officials of varying degrees of legality.  An important feature: the company does not have IT-Schnick.  Only the ‚Äúadmin coming‚Äù part-time - and he is not ah, as a specialist, but honest and trusted-tested (therefore, the Chief categorically does not even want to discuss his replacement, although he regularly sticks to the shoals for him).  Fifty harsh techies with solid autocad and excellent engineering skills is understandable in terms of information security as small children, alas, even we send a file by mail across America or a flash drive in our pockets from room to room, with a network, not often, but it happens.  Therefore, all kinds of "clouds" were rejected - even there it‚Äôs just to figure out, if something is wrong, the devil breaks his leg, they will send a link to the updated ULA and good bye. <br><br><h4>  Eventually </h4><br>  We did it this way - we bought the remnants of a batch of media players on the 1273rd realtech chipset - <br>  <b>five hundred rubles each</b> .  (Yes, the dependency of the goods is a tough thing in the world of hi-tech. New, in boxes, full set. The century is sometimes short with excellent, in general things, although it is time to get used to it.) <br><br>  Established several of them home dacham.  On each rolled <a href="http://moservices.org/forum/viewtopic.php%3Ff%3D41%26t%3D3240">mo-services</a> , and torrent rocking.  This firmware turns the media player into a normal Linux machine, with a console, telnet, crown, etc., and is able to disable the entire media component of the chipset and even the GUI as needed.  The media players even turned out to be dual-drive (the second SATA can be cut from the outside with a wire), and a pair of USB (which you can plug in, by the way, the same media player - and so all of them are chained together. The truth is, they didn‚Äôt try them out.) <br><br>  It is configured and works like this: the server is engaged in backups - a separate case like what.  he puts the results of these backups in the form of rar- and 7z-files into the torrent-rocking caches and updates the torrent-file.  All these home media players, to some extent, all wake up at the same time, update the torrent file and download everything from the server (and from each other) that is written in that file.  having uploaded and standing a bit on the distribution in case of an unexpected difference in seasonal times - they fall asleep.  Thus, a fresh up-to-date backup is stored in several copies at once in dozens of physically distant places.  What is important is that the firm has full physical access to all these places, even if it is not instantaneous. <br><br>  Any one of them - it is enough that the company, with the loss of all files and even computers - could continue to work almost from the breakpoint. <br><br>  All of them (when they are not sleeping) are accessible via http and telnet, on the server you can see the log of peers-siders on each file, in general, you can even adminit it from the sofa from home). <br><br>  It is clear that the media players are vulnerable, that by opening one, everyone else is visible and it‚Äôs not a problem to reach them physically or remotely, because it‚Äôs not so easy to make the home user safe ‚Äî the home router and the home media player are not in the hands of a non-IT security man. the most secure devices.  But at least some decentralization. <br><br>  It is also a kind of protection against cryptographs, from which, according to rumors, ordinary antiviruses do not save, and this is really scary. <br><br>  A very important point is that these media players, in contrast to the two / three-disk NAS, which are quite mass at that time, quietly digest NTFS, both from the box right after and the alternative firmware rollout - the disk from it stubbornly sticks into any Windows if necessary the machine and there on it - normal clear directories.  More importantly, they do not spoil the data on the newly inserted disks ‚Äî these ‚Äúboxes‚Äù pick up disks with data without any reformatting, repartitioning of partitions or the like.  unexpected miracles.  In general, all the costs in the end turned out - in fact, only the hard drives. <br><br>  In general, here is such a life hack, if suddenly someone likes it - use it, this backup is much better than none. <br><br>  Gentlemen from Akronis, you are for us - about as an ocean seiner for a fisherman with a fishing rod - solutions for price and complexity (mastering) somewhere from a parallel universe. <br><hr><br>  <b>ps:</b> I apologize for the vulgar "comp" instead of "computer", but the painfully long form is long. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/318052/">https://habr.com/ru/post/318052/</a></p>
