You can probably stick Havok into Unity, but it is painfully and incomprehensibly why (I googled the Internet on this topic before writing this).  And last but not least there are problems with the licensing of proprietary code.  As a result, this summer should be Havok Physics. </li></ul><br><h1 id="art-direktor-deus-ex-uhodit">  Art director Deus Ex leaves </h1><br><ul><li>  Okay, now ambiguous news.  Art Director Deus Ex: Human Revolution and Mankind Divided purchased a tractor and drove it from Eidos Montreal.  He is now on the Rogue Factor team, which has made the mega successful Mordheim: City of the Damned.  He will not take part in the development of their new tactics, Necromunda: Underhive Wars, and instead will be engaged in some new undisclosed game. <img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/48/c1/ez/48c1ez2o75emlj_7rlyd2sfeeie.jpeg"></li></ul><br><h1 id="besedka-i-e3">  Arbor and E3 </h1><br><ul><li>  Many feared that the Arbor would not arrive at E3, following Sony and EA darting back and forth.  <a href="https://twitter.com/bethesda/status/1107661942645276672">So, come</a> .

Do not worry, now if Sekiro 2 will be, then it will tear everyone to pieces! <br><br>  To prevent this from being magic for you, "where do these people get data from", you need to look at the charts right <a href="https://www.chart-track.co.uk/index.jsp%3Fc%3Dp/software/uk/latest/index.jsp">here</a> , fascinated by pressing F5. </li></ul><br><h1 id="vozrozhdyonnaya-lucasfilm-games-samozakapyvaetsya">  Reborn Lucasfilm Games Self-Digging </h1><br><ul><li>  In past news, I wrote that Disney revived Lucasfilm Games based on their job site with open vacancies.

On their own, Disney games will not be done yet. </li></ul><br><h1 id="google-stadia-est-detey">  Google Stadia eats kids </h1><br><ul><li>  Began a mass hysteria about Google Stadia.

Goodbie sweet prince.  At the same time, Steam, on the contrary, is proud of his retail cards!  However, in Russia we didn‚Äôt really use this method of payment, so the broad masses did not suffer. <img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pj/u0/n7/pju0n7cuzopot3o6prmxgr-rg3a.png"></li></ul><br><h1 id="stopgame-namolil-i-razbanen">  Game-space namolil and unban </h1><br><ul><li>  On the ninth day, the <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/stopgameru">Twitch channel Stop Game,</a> recently retired to the ban, came to life and got up.

The indicated time on the site is "March 25 at 2:00 pm Pacific Time".  As far as I understand, it is exactly 00:00 Moscow time.  I will try to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/javawatch">stream it on my channel</a> , if I don‚Äôt fall asleep, or Sony doesn‚Äôt build me on YouTube right along the stream, as they have done there. </p><br><p>  <strong>UPD:</strong> been on this damn stream.  No fish, just 20 minutes.  Initially, 13 minutes were marinated with a splash screen, then they showed a couple of shots from Iron Man, CTR, NoManSky Beyond, ReadySet Heroes, Blood &amp; Truth, every C-class trifle, Observation, Five Nights at Freddey's, Concrete Gene, Days Gone, mortalit, everything. </p><br></li></ul><br><h1 id="tencent-zhiruet-ne-po-detski--vse-uporolis-po-strimingu">  Tencent is not childishly + all have been streaming </h1><br><ul><li><p>  Chinese corporation Tencent has published a <a href="https://www.tencent.com/en-us/articles/8003551553167294.pdf">report for the 2018 fiscal year</a> .  They have become richer by 32%, earning more than 45.5 billion dollars.  Recall that last year it was impossible to release PC games for 9 months in a row, and as soon as they were allowed back at the end of last year, Tencent's revenue <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-tencent-gaming/tencent-shares-spike-as-china-watchdog-flags-video-game-approvals-idUSKCN1OK08X">jumped as much as 4.6%</a> according to Reuters.  However, everyone jumped, no wonder.  But at the same time, Tencent continued to rivet mobile games, which brought them 11.6 billion dollars, which is 24% more than a year earlier.  It is important that, among other things, Tencent has top mobile games - PUBG Mobile and Honor of Kings, on which they, in fact, were welded.  I don‚Äôt know in my heart what Honor of Kings is, but dough drips from it be healthy. </p><br></li><li><p>  And by the way, Tencent makes its own <a href="https://technode.com/2019/03/21/tencent-to-begin-closed-beta-for-cloud-gaming-service-start/">Start user streaming platform</a> , which is now in beta.  That is, rival Google and Mikey.  However, they will not compete with Google, because Google simply does not work in this market in China.  No data on monetization methods or launch time is available. </p><br></li><li><p>  And for that matter, even Walmart <a href="https://www.usgamer.net/articles/walmart-video-game-streaming-service-exclusive">wants to launch</a> its custom streaming service.  They were also at GDC 2019 and asked about it.  Walmart Labs has 6,000 employees, they have huge data centers, and in principle, they can do something too. </p><br></li><li><p>  Microsoft <a href="https://twinfinite.net/2019/03/xcloud-details-revealed-microsoft">began to reveal the</a> features of XCloud - their own streaming platform. </p><br><ul><li>  They want to transfer to the cloud all the games from the XBox One, and partly from the PC. </li><li>  Migration of games should be automatic, but the Cloud Aware API will allow you to finish small details. </li><li>  Obviously, in the presence of a controller, poking fingers with your fingers is optional. </li><li>  Management schemes, again obviously, can be customized to the needs of the game. </li><li>  And so on. </li><li>  Shown a XCloud datacenter map (coincident with Azure datacenters, who could guess!) </li></ul><br></li></ul><br><p>  It is clear that with all these presents everything is not so simple if you think about words and read between the lines, and this is a separate big job.  Unfortunately, I didn‚Äôt google Microsoft live recordings and can only be judged by what people tweeted and fotaled.  If someone zanet, where to get live - reset in the comments, please. </p><br><h1 id="za-upotreblenie-veschestv-zaderzhivayut-relizy">  Substance use delayed releases </h1><br><ul><li><p>  Trash and waste with the game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judgment_(video_game)">Judgment</a> continues.  This is the spin-off of the famous Yakuza.  She did not come out in the west at all, because on December 13, sales were <a href="https://twitter.com/SEGA_OFFICIAL/status/1105680590529916928">stopped</a> because musician and actor Pierre Taki, who voiced one of the characters of Judgment, smelled coke, and in Japan it is a hard criminal matter.  At the same time in Japan, it was already released on December 13, and in other places it should appear on June 25.  Now they <a href="https://twitter.com/RGGStudio/status/1109077293207416832">change the appearance of the protagonist</a> on a mustache uncle. </p><br><p>  It was: </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/-a/0x/wk/-a0xwk9lj9jljoobiolndfzwibq.png"></p><br><p>  It became: </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vb/fg/hf/vbfghf1d5e-y_lbadsd_oyrhenw.jpeg"></p><br><p>  It's funny that this garbage is not the first time, in the remaster of Yakuza 4 there was also a narcotic in voice acting actors, and it was also <a href="https://kotaku.com/after-cocaine-allegations-yakuza-4-gets-a-new-voice-ac-1829957917">changed visually in the game</a> . </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ph/9c/qq/ph9cqqqp_7eujh7yozok67ktul8.png"></p><br><p>  That is, to be a yakuza and kill people is a publicly approved activity, and sniffing substances is socially deprecated.  Strange these Japanese. </p><br></li></ul><br><h1 id="denuvo-protiv-zakonov-fiziki">  Denuvo against the laws of physics </h1><br><ul><li>  Denuvo continues to fight in agony, and now they have come up with the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãreleasing <a href="https://resources.irdeto.com/video-games/datasheet-anti-cheat">some anti-cheat with machine learning</a> .  In general, I am pleased with their problems, these are such old familiar feelings, since the days of Star Force, when you want to DRM manufacturers only the worst.  The anti-cheat feature is that no SDK or API is needed for its work, it just works. </li></ul><br><h1 id="epic-epic-epic">  Epic, Epic, Epic. </h1><br><ul><li><p>  Steve Ellison, head of the Epic Games Store, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/epic-on-pulling-metro-exodus-from-steam-we-dont-want-to-do-that-ever-again/">argues</a> that the Metro Exodus situation was a mistake that would not happen again.  Epic will no longer be taken to a Stemble woman at such an advanced stage. </p><br><p>  In order not to invent his words for the author: </p><br><blockquote>  It‚Äôs not a problem. It was a time when we‚Äôve spent time talking ... never do this again in this way. </blockquote><p>  Learn how to move populist programs and follow the words :-) "we will never do it again <strong>in this way.</strong> " And in some other way - why not. </p><br></li><li><p>  In addition, Tim Sweeney recently he told The Verge that they are not a doer-eater, so they <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/20/18273639/epic-games-ceo-tim-sweeney-epic-store-moderation-valve-apple-google-gdc-2019">will moderate everything</a> and eject any slag from EGS.  This he hints at The Rape Day and his ilk. </p><br></li><li><p>  And besides, they are friends with good producers.  For example, with the Hubmle Bundle, they will allow to sell EGS keys directly to the Humble Store, and they will not take a percentage of the sales of games from them, they announced this for all the same GDC 2019. </p><br></li><li><p>  And in EGS Quantic Dream: Heavy Rain and Detroit Become Human will be released exclusively.  And Control from Remedy, to completely finish off. </p><br></li><li><p>  And Chris Avellone <a href="https://twitter.com/ComicBookNOW/status/1108535192908517376">announced on Twitter</a> that The Outer Worlds will be transferred to the Epic Games Store.  As always, wild boiling goose. </p><br><p>  I don't know what Chris really meant, but maybe something that didn‚Äôt do without a facsuckle again.  News before this for a few days leaked PCGamesN, accidentally publishing a pre-prepared tweet. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gk/oo/pe/gkoopelpoqjas9qdh4x91w_3nyc.png"></p><br></li><li><p>  Epic for free will lay out <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/blog/epic-s-free-online-services-launch-for-all-game-developers%3FsessionInvalidated%3Dtrue">Epic Online Services</a> for all developers.  They themselves use them to design Fortnite.  Now available tool for analytics (all sorts of ritensheny and their visualization) and a ticket holder to communicate with the players.  On the way, the opportunity to group with players and play together, a ready-made solution for matchmaking, and a system of laders and achivok. </p><br></li><li><p>  In general, these interviews dofiga.  Eurogamer journalist Martin Robinson has published <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-03-21-the-big-interview-tim-sweeney-on-why-players-should-embrace-epic-games-store">an interview with Tim Sweeney</a> with the GDC 2019.
