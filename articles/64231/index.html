  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to legalize iPhone, imported into Ukraine from abroad</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  From July 1 stupid rules for the sale of mobile phones are in force in Ukraine, requiring the introduction of a unique identifier of each phone into the ‚Äúwhite database‚Äù - the IMEI code (International Mobile Equipment Identity - International Mobile Equipment Identity).  From now on, phones with ‚Äúgray‚Äù IMEI will be able to work in networks of operators for 3 months, after which they will be blocked.  When buying phones in regular stores should not be a problem - distributors of phones register them in bulk.  The main thing - do not run into smuggled phones. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  But there is such a popular model on the market as the iPhone, which official dealers do not sell, but carry ‚Äúhitech-shuttles‚Äù in small lots or people buy their own abroad abroad for themselves or friends.  A broken or never blocked iPhone can be bought in Ukraine, but you will have to pay a lot.  For example, in Kiev online stores MacStore.org.ua and iPhone-Center.com.ua, fresh iPhone 3GS models cost $ 1300-1400 (the previous generation iPhone 3G - $ 650-850).  In the first store, mobile phones are brought under the order from European countries where phones are sold without being tied to an operator, and guarantee that the IMEI code will be ‚Äúwhite and fluffy‚Äù.  In the second there are several phones available, but their friendship with the IMEI database is not guaranteed. <br><br>  However, it is better to hit the road to Europe by means of cheap airlines than to pay for a courier trip.  According to VertygoTeam.com, the iPhone 3GS, working with any operator, is sold in Switzerland for 340 euros and in Italy for 500 euros.  UPD 22:00: It is suggested that the iPhone 3GS in Switzerland costs about 650 euros for a 16GB model and 800 euros - 32GB, and you also need to contact the support service to officially unlock it.  And on the forum MacRumors Europe similar prices lead to different countries.

      Here is a guide on how to add the IMEI code of an iPhone brought for personal use to a national database (Yevgeny Svirsky, an analyst at the press center of the Ukrainian State Center for Radio Frequencies, shared the text): <br><br>  According to the current legislation, a citizen has the right to import into Ukraine from abroad without obtaining permission to the UCRF to import two mobile phones.  In this case, according to the customs legislation of Ukraine, when crossing the customs border, a citizen must fill out a customs declaration, in which the type of mobile phone that is imported and its IMEI code should be entered in the ‚Äúradiating devices‚Äù section. <br><br>  To include mobile phone codes that were purchased abroad and imported into Ukraine in accordance with the customs declaration into the generalized database of IMEI codes, the citizen applies to the UCRF with a request to enter such codes for the IMEI of the terminals to the generalized database of the imported mobile phones.  The application also includes the original of the customs declaration, in which mobile phones are recorded.  The application with the application is sent by registered letter to the Ukrainian State Center of Radio Frequencies (Pobedy Avenue, 15th km, Kiev, Ukraine) or is transmitted personally to one of its branches, which are located in all regional centers.  On the basis of these documents, the codes of IMEA phones of citizens will be put on the white list and when connected will be served by all mobile operators. <br><br>  If a greater number of telephones are imported into Ukraine, then, according to the law, it is necessary to obtain permission from the Ukrainian State Center for Radio Frequencies to import them.  The procedure for obtaining permits can be found on the UCRF website. <br><br>  The application form is also on the UCRF website. <br><br>  So, if you travel to Switzerland or Italy, do not forget to buy 2 iPhones and fill out documents in Ukraine - your friends will be very grateful, or you can resell them for profit. <br><br>  Read more about the "white lists" and recommendations for the acquisition of mobile phones in the new conditions, for example, on Life.pravda.com.ua: Ros'yasnennya for usi koristuvach—ñv mobile phones. <br><br>  My conclusion about the new rules is as follows: legal phones will become more expensive, bribes and smuggling proceeds will flow into other pockets, and Ukrainian citizens will receive another hemorrhoids on their heads from their favorite Ukrainian officials. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/64231/">https://habr.com/ru/post/64231/</a></p>
