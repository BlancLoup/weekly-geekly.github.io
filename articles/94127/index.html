It contains my own thoughts on torrents. <br>  I do not know how you are comrades, but I think that the torrent movement has two main problems: <br>  - an excessive amount of torrent distributions of identical content <br>  - snack with copyright holders <br>  If everything is clear with the second, then I would like to understand a little about the first thesis. <a name="habracut"></a>  I mean, if I want to download for example Dr. House, I go to the tracker, enter the name of the series with the number or the name of the series and the search engine gives me a bunch of options (standard resolution, high resolution, English, Russian subtitles or No, voice acting and translation from a film or someone else) as much as his eyes run.  And this is only on one tracker, and as we know them, thank God (as an option to Allah, the Holy Spirit, Buddha)) and etc.) are many, and there are a lot of torrents in general.  All this creates some problems with downloading / distribution, or rather with the effectiveness of the whole process.  Now, to the point, it seems to me that in this situation the next solution suggests itself, you need a video format and torrent files that allow you to combine several in one file, so that we can more easily explain an example.  There is a series of Dr. House on the tracker, I click on the link to the torrent file and I am offered the choice of resolution and language, maybe something else, I choose the average resolution and Russian language and download, I immediately get up for distribution and I can download parts of the file everyone who downloads this series, no matter what resolution and language they choose, they just get from me only the part that I have.  Those who chose a lower resolution can download all the required information from me and without even touching on some part of my file, who need the average resolution download all that I have from this file is one-on-one, and who needs to download all that I have and They are looking for where to get parts of a file that I don‚Äôt have, but those who have a high resolution file on the screw, i.e.  from the one who can distribute it at all to everyone who wants to watch this series of House. <br>  For clarity, consider the following analogy, preparation for the exam in orthopedic dentistry - viewing the ChingChook film (Book of orthopedic dentists, book technical steps for making prostheses and a book on materials science for simplicity, 3 books correspond to a high resolution image, 2 books, respectively, medium, and 1 book low resolution) I‚Äôm sitting in the dormitory (in the distribution), I am preparing for the exam with 2 books (I have a fully downloaded movie in the middle resolution and I‚Äôm watching it), the other residents of the hostel (by  Tracker users also want to prepare for the exam, someone needs only 1 textbook, someone needs 2, and someone needs all 3 (low, medium and high resolution) in real life I can scan 2 books, but for existing ones I can only do this for the rules (existing video formats and torrent file) for those who need exactly 2 books, and who only need 1, although I have it, I can‚Äôt give it and those who need all 3 I can‚Äôt even give those 2 that I have, and the third he would have found someone else. <br>  It requires the development of a format that allows you to add high-resolution video from lesser resolution files and additional information, so that I can have a movie with maximum quality on my screw to distribute the movie to everyone and those who need medium and high quality and minimum.  And about the same with dubbing.  A la matryoshka, but not to be confused with the format matroska (MKV).  In this situation, there would be fewer files on the trackers that would improve navigation through the torrent catalogs, there would be more seeders on the distributions, which would increase the speed. <br><br>  And at the expense of the second problem, the idea is this, the trackers are attracted to users by luring them with the opportunity to share content, users pay for this opportunity by viewing ads on the site and clicks on advertising links, it would be logical to give some of the profits from advertising to the creators of this or that content. weights are taken into account, i.e.  the more times a file is downloaded, the more money goes to those who contributed to its creation, possibly influencing the deduction of feedback from the content.  A shit movie came out, downloaded it 5 times, and crap it in comments (interesting situation shit crap) the movie will receive 5 rubles 65 kopecks, a really cool movie came out, it was downloaded 6 billion times, the advertisement on the page with its distribution works in full, the reviews are excellent , the filmmakers are transferred an elegant amount.  If such a system can ever earn, the filmmakers will make efforts to download their movie from rutracker.org (or from somewhere else) to download as many people as possible.

      I repeat, I do not impose my opinion on anyone, I just think about a free topic.
