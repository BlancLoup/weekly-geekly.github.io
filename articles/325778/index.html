Parents, friends, teachers and even doctors.  We are surrounded by rules and laws, algorithms and various guides.  I want to highlight one comment to my last post from a <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/zoomerman/" class="user_link">Zoomerman</a> user: <br><blockquote>  A programmer is a person who creates programs. <br>  The programmer builds a chain of events using available resources. <br>  Programs are computer, musical, behavioral, educational, etc. <br>  The program begins to be created at the moment when the person determines the starting and ending points of the process. <br>  And if the manager says ‚ÄúI have a product, I want to change it for money‚Äù - he turns into a programmer and builds an algorithm for this process. <br>  For me, a programmer is not a caste or a profession.  A programmer is a state of mind. <br></blockquote><a name="habracut"></a><br>  When I received a higher technical education, we had practical training in the first and second year.  And the whole semester we made a hammer.  Yes, the usual hammer.  The method of its manufacture was unusual.  More precisely, the method is normal, but not for the person who came to get a higher education.  We were forced to make it a file, an 8-sided hammer with a rusty file.  Who wrote this tutorial and where?  What did the person who wrote this code want to program in us with this work?  Apparently hard work. <br><br>  In the fourth year, I waited for a new subject with the impressive name of <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/CALS-%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D1%2585%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B8">CALS technology</a> .  Continuous information support for the supply and life cycle of products - this name was a balm on the brain, after files and propaganda of the Soviet legacy in the field of machine tools.  And you know what happened?  I did not understand anything of what the young teacher read out to us from printouts.  He did not teach us, but read to us.  It was terribly boring.  All students missed.  We sat like Bart Simpson in a Sunday sermon and dangled our legs.

      In general, our curriculum programmers in the Ministry of Education are very far from reality.  My parents are teachers.  By the way, they used to be called ‚Äúteacher of work‚Äù, now ‚Äúteacher of technology‚Äù.  Apparently the use of the buzzword somehow had to change the attitude towards teachers.  The jokes about the fact that when a fizruk and a teacher of labor cease to drink, the school becomes a gymnasium and gradually becomes irrelevant.  This I judge by my father.  But questions about school programs are becoming very topical.  That material base, which is incorporated in the modern program on technology lessons, is completely absent in the workshops.  There is nothing.  Jigsaws, files, hammers - all inherited from the USSR.  Still wondering why not enough workers in the workplace?  And where did so many managers come from and, don't you take offense, programmers? <br><br>  All of you know how a modern elevator works in a house.  The motion algorithm is simple and straightforward.  Have you thought about what is missing in the elevator control program?  What algorithm did programmers forget to add to the code?  Take a ride on the elevator at rush hour. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Forgotten algorithm</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Each elevator has a weight / overload sensor.  Coming down from the upper floors, the crowded elevator stops to pick up people on the way down.  It takes a lot of time for a useless stop.  It is enough to add an algorithm to the code that will give the command to the elevator to descend without stopping at a certain load.  Add just three lines of code to the firmware of modern elevators.  Increase usability, as bus drivers do that stop when their car looks like a can of sprats. </div></div><br>  <b>PS</b> <br>  After the recent explosion in the subway in St. Petersburg, the driver was introduced to the award, who, according to the instructions, brought the train to the nearest station and thus saved lives.  This is a very worthy act.  No less worthy and noteworthy is the person or group of people who developed this very instruction.  These are the real programmers of life, who wrote a magnificent code in the form of a manual that helped people to return home to their relatives and friends that day.  Write the right programs, and your code may one day save someone‚Äôs life or make people more comfortable. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/325778/">https://habr.com/ru/post/325778/</a></p>
