  <section class="page js-page"><h1>We make investments from the site</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><h4>  How much is? </h4><br>  We are often asked with questions like "I attach the TK, say the cost and time."  There are more complicated cases: ‚ÄúAnd how much does it cost to make a music service, it's like spotify and Yandex music, only there I will have my own fishes‚Äù.  And when you understand the essence of the project, its goals and objectives, why one or another item was added to the TK, there are often resistances: ‚ÄúWhy so many unnecessary questions, everything is already written and invented, just say how much it costs‚Äù <br><br>  This position is logical, because quite a lot of things are really written and thought out.  And spent a lot of time.  But is it written correctly?  And how many moments have been overlooked and will emerge during the project? <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Such tasks are usually written by two categories of people: <br><ol><li>  Employees of the client: the project is considered from the point of view of the client: the description of pages and the content on them.  The remaining moments are often omitted.  It happens, even the essence of the project is not described.  No developer will do anything good if he does not understand the essence of the project, why and who needs it, its possible development paths. </li><li>  Employees of another studio.  Will good studios without analytics, design, free of charge and without SMS be a functional purpose or technical task of the project? </li></ol>

      The very meaning of the question is no less important - they ask for the cost - they see the site as costs.  How to buy a phone.  But the task of business is not to buy a site.  The challenge is to earn more dough.  The site is just a tool.  It means that it should be viewed not as a cost, but as an investment.  With such a layout, the average amount of investment is proportional to the financial return.  We, the studio, are not working to make you a website.  We work so that with our help you can extract profits and / or reduce expenses. <br><br>  There is a big temptation to just make a website.  All competitors already have, but I don't even have a damn thing.  And your friends have nothing to show.  The results of this approach are simple: you lose money, you lose time and you probably lose faith in the fact that the site can actually be useful.  You will be even more outraged that someone there asks for the site as much as 5 million rubles. <br><br>  The average conversion of sites in RuNet is 0.1‚Äì1% (according to personal observations of the runet market). That is, imagine you have a store in the shopping and entertainment center, in which 1,000 people came in a month.  They walked, touched your goods, loaded the work of consultants, trampled the floors.  Of these, 20 people reached the ticket office, and 6 people paid. Such a point would not have existed for a long time. <br><br>  Unfortunately for the internet, this situation is typical.  Yes, of course, there is a specificity here, because 1000 per day is a small figure for an online store, and for offline points this is a pretty good indicator.  However, there is something to strive for.  And raising the conversion to at least 3-4% will increase profits by 3-4 times. <br><br><h4>  How much to invest? </h4><br>  It is necessary to go into studios and agencies with the question ‚ÄúHow much do I invest money to earn so much in such and such periods?‚Äù Or ‚ÄúDo I have as many rubles as I can earn in such a period?‚Äù Of these questions formed the business goals and objectives of the site.  Nobody will answer them right away: you need to understand the business, its processes, make an analysis of the market, think over possible options for solving the problem using the Internet.  But if they say: "Oh, we xs" - leave. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/f0a/852/7c0/f0a8527c040d5f6df0d10fa80bdcb939.jpg" alt="chrome and customers"><br><br>  Also, do not forget about the risks: any investment - risks.  They may or may not pay off.  You need to be prepared for the studio to make a mistake. <br><br>  Solutions to the problems of the company using the Internet set.  It is important to understand that the Internet is the most important point of contact for the company and customers.  The reason is the Internet everywhere: in the PC, in smartphones, in clocks, at home, in the subway, in refrigerators and irons.  And the site itself is not the only option to build contact with the consumer.  But this is one of the easiest ways to convey to the client your vision, your products, your positioning. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/f0f/3aa/e16/f0f3aae16ef232cffcc3b745043222fa.jpg" alt="Jim fuck"><br><br>  Therefore, your website is a reflection of the company's marketing, communication and brand strategy. <br>  This does not mean that before you begin work on the site, you need to develop a bunch of strategies, order naming with branding.  Of course, they are important, but for small companies it is more important that the founder understands: who we are, how we are positioning, how different we are from the rest, who our target audience is, what we want to tell them.  When you understand this, you are on the way to make a website an investment. <br><br><h4>  Summarizing </h4><br><ol><li>  Speak the language of business, set business goals; </li><li>  Answer the questions of the studio / agency, there will be a lot of them; </li><li>  Never make a site for the sake of a site; </li><li>  Clearly highlight your positioning, target audience and competitors. </li></ol><br>  The rest is studio work. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/293986/">https://habr.com/ru/post/293986/</a></p>
