These rules will establish Roskomnadzor.  The ministry prepared a draft methodology for counting traffic to such sites. <br><br>  First of all, the authors of the project clarified the notion of ‚Äúuser‚Äù: those will be recognized as those who have watched a movie for at least 15 seconds or simply viewed one of the pages of the site in the browser. <br><br>  The limit of 15 seconds did not arise from scratch, because the notion of ‚Äúrefusal‚Äù has been used on the Internet for a long time.  A visitor‚Äôs visit to the site is considered a refusal if the following conditions are fulfilled simultaneously: <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><ul><li>  no more than one page view was recorded during the visit; </li><li>  the duration of the visit turned out to be less than the time specified for the calculation of failures (by default, 15 seconds). </li></ul><br>  The source of statistics will be publicly available information on the resource, open data and attendance counters.  From July 1, each online cinema will have to install one of the metering programs offered by Roskomnadzor.  Roskomnadzor did not specify what criteria recommended counters should have and how the work on their selection is progressing.

      The Internet cinema sites, including the Tvzavr site, contain a large number of different counters that allow analyzing user behavior and counting them, Marina Surygina, general director of the Tvzavr online cinema, <a href="http://izvestia.ru/news/718259">told</a> Izvestia: <br><br>  ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt care what kind of counter we‚Äôre asked to install, as long as it is free and easy to install,‚Äù she added.  - Of course, I would like Roskomnadzor to choose one of those already installed by almost everyone (for example, Mediascope) or some kind of free analogue.  Pay for additional meters, which we, in fact, do not need, we do not want. " <br><br>  In addition, according to representatives of the department, online video services with an audience of more than 100 thousand viewers should introduce additional restrictions on the content of the video and ensure the age marking of content. <br><br>  Relevant legislative initiatives will take effect on July 1.  Among them - a package of amendments to the laws "On Information ...", "On the Protection of Children ...", the Code of Administrative Offenses (CAO). <br><br>  Under the new rules, law-abiding video services should exclude content that justifies extremism, containing pornography, foul language, and other socially disapproved materials. <br><br>  Accounting services that want to play by the rules, will also keep Roskomnadzor.  He will add volunteers to a special register of audiovisual services.  Sites will be required to send reports to the Office.  Only a Russian legal entity or a Russian who does not have the citizenship of another state can own such an audiovisual service. <br><br>  Video services that violate the new rules will be fined or blocked by the decision of the Moscow City Court. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/42a/624/d4b/42a624d4b2edb9fb3089a1836e9b4bcd.jpg" alt="image"><br>  According to J'son &amp; Partners Consulting, in 2016 the volume of the Russian market of legal video services reached 11.18 billion rubles.  The growth compared to 2015 amounted to 32%.  According to the company's estimates, by 2020 the income of legal video services in Russia will increase to about 20 billion rubles.  The average annual growth rate in 2017‚Äì2020 will be 16%. <br><br>  The American research company Gartner <a href="http://www.sostav.ru/publication/gartner-zatraty-na-potrebitelskie-videoservisy-dostignut-314-3-mlrd-v-2017-godu-26520.html">has calculated</a> that in 2017, global spending on the use of consumer video services will grow by 4.2%, to $ 314.3 billion. Already by 2020, according to Gartner, the video services market will increase by 14% compared to 2017 and reach $ 358.4 billion </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/356164/">https://habr.com/ru/post/356164/</a></p>
