  <section class="page js-page"><h1>To help startups</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Recently, a fresh newspaper from our government came out to help our entrepreneurs. <br>  A new document on this in many reference systems is still missing.  In fact, the topic is a comment on this document + some personal experience. <br><br>  The document implies that any person can receive 58,800 rubles from the state for the start of their business, plus another 58,800 for each employee hired.  Hiring a disabled person, the state will compensate 30 tr.  on equipment locations.  In general, it sounds very interesting and tempting ... <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In practice, it does not look much sadder, you should officially be listed on the labor exchange, if you want to get these 58 tr.  then the question arises, and if I want to open my own business, combining with work for hire, then what ??  As I was told at the stock exchange everything breaks off, you have an income, sit and be silent.  Well, whoever is already working, he will have to open his own business on his capital. 
      <br>

      <br>
      The second question - they became an individual entrepreneur and decided to get another 58 tr, then you need to hire an official officially, but for a person who is not prepared for finance, this will entail additional difficulties and costs, you must immediately register with the FSS, PF and pay taxes there, taking into account the new laws on raising taxes to 34% from 2011 from the wage fund, these 58 tr.  become dubious pleasure.  It is easier to work in black at first, which most do. <br><br>  Now some more experience <br>  I personally know one seven - the wife and her husband both registered as Ipshnki and received 58 tr.  Engaged in the delivery of water, it is not easy, I would even say hard.  It is necessary to build a client base, a competitive market, and for 58 tr.  You can not buy much. <br>  And many entrepreneurs open their micro businesses also in competitive markets, where money from the sky does not pour in the form of oil or gas, they earn there. <br>  Both were registered at the labor exchange, wrote a business plan, got the money.  So the first thing that they were forced to do was pay taxes ‚Äî a fixed payment on the insurance and funded parts of the pension.  And this is no less than 7 tr.  from each, so remains 51 tr.  Although this could be done before 12/31/2009!  In the beginning of the activity, it would be possible to give freedom of disposal of money! <br>  And they also made me report for the balance of the amount to which, what, in general, the state gives with one hand, and takes the other. <br><br>  Decree of the Government of the Russian Federation of December 14, 2009 No. 1011 Moscow On granting in 2010 and 2011 subsidies from the federal budget to the budgets of the subjects of the Russian Federation for the implementation of additional measures aimed at reducing tensions in the labor market of the subjects of the Russian Federation <br>  <a href="http://www.rg.ru/2009/12/21/trud-subsidii-dok.html">www.rg.ru/2009/12/21/trud-subsidii-dok.html</a> <br><br><habracut></habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/78931/">https://habr.com/ru/post/78931/</a></p>
