As in the previous series, I do not pretend to the depth of disclosure of technology, seeking only to show the main options for the development of infrastructure elements.  The previous series about the infrastructure is <a title="Infrastructure of the modern office - 1: introduction and organizational issues" href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/it-infrastructure/53997/">here</a> and <a title="Infrastructure of modern office - 2: SCS and LAN" href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/it-infrastructure/54523/">here</a> (and here is the <a title="Infrastructure bonus track-1: examples of LAN on Allied telesis" href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/it-infrastructure/55230/">bonus track about Allied Telesis equipment</a> ). <br><h4>  Provider inputs </h4><br>  There is a whole range of possible solutions, each of which should be made guided by the scale of the organization, budget and external factors.  Consider the main points: <br><ol><li>  You are a small company (up to ten people), you call in the basement of a residential building or, moreover, in an apartment on the first floor of a residential building. <br>  In such a situation, it‚Äôs not necessary to pick and choose a provider, and you should count on having a local provider in the building (if there are several of them, you are very lucky, the competition increases the level of service).  You can try to save money by arranging the Internet for an individual, however, in this case, you should be prepared for the fact that in prime time the local provider decides, for example, ‚Äúchange network equipment‚Äù, which will lead to unpleasant downtime.  It is advisable in such a situation to provide a reserve, at least in the form of the mobile Internet (Skylink, Yota, Edge / GPRS) - a critical letter in this case, albeit slowly, but it will crawl.  Telephony in such a situation, as a rule, is performed as a ‚Äúcopper-fiber channel‚Äù of a city provider. </li><li>  You are still a small company, but you are sitting in the garage (cabins, stalls, tree houses, buildings in the industrial zone). <br>  All is bleak - your only way out is the radio channel to the nearest point of presence of high-speed Internet, or, if there is no chance to finish off the radio, the Internet is via a cell phone.  If you still have chances, stock up on long-range directional antennas and walk to the nearest place where the Internet can be.  In my practice, there was a case when a car-care center worked for about a year through a stream, which was located two kilometers from.  The problems in this case are the same as in the previous one (instability of the local cable provider), however, in the case of using a long Wi-Fi link, you will also depend on the weather.  In heavy rain or snowfall, interruptions are not uncommon .. </li><li>  You drive into the business center. <br>  Everything is better, but not without specifics: as a rule, the owners of business centers have already agreed with one or two large providers, which limits your choice (you can only bring your provider if you are a very large company with a serious rental rate).  Plus the situation is that the channel is organized quickly, and most likely without problems.  The obvious minus is one - monopolists in the building can turn up very sad tariffs. </li><li>  (my situation) You drive into a separate building. <br>  Hemorrhoids are terrible, but with the right approach, it will turn out very nicely. More details about this scenario are given below. </li></ol><br>  So, a detached building.  Considering that you are the master of the situation, when organizing provider inputs, consider the following: <br><ul><li>  Fault tolerance (any more or less serious router can choose a live channel).  If possible, build two independent channels from independent providers; </li><li>  Expensive (more serious provider will ask for more serious money).  At the same time, a cheaper provider will most likely sin with all childhood diseases of home networks - the fall of the channel during the day, ‚Äúscheduled preventive maintenance‚Äù in prime time and other amenities </li><li>  Connection time  If in the previous scenarios you would most likely be hooked up within a day or two, then building an individual channel may become a matter of several months (here and coordination with the city cable services, and the slowness of large providers, and problems with builders ..) </li></ul><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  If time is tight, arrange temporary input using <em>any</em> of the available methods, then wait for your provider to reach it. <br><br>  In my case, the process of organizing fiber input (the center of Moscow, the largest provider), took <strong>ten</strong> months, of which nine and a half lasted for coordination at various levels.  By the way, the local provider stretched its fiber through the air from a nearby residential high-rise during the week. <br><blockquote>  I would like to send a separate hello to an employee of the local telephone node, who went with a bulging pocket all the time while the optics installers were working, threatening to ‚Äúcut off the cable in the hatch‚Äù, then ‚Äúyou will be discharged a fine‚Äù, then singing songs of the old shepherd on the topic ‚Äúwe are all people , we all want to eat " </blockquote><br>  When designing input (s), agree on the passage of the trunk inside the building to your switching node in advance, if possible, providing all engineering means for cable passage (trays, ducts, easily accessible ceiling ducts, etc.), otherwise a weekly delay of cable operators could have disastrous consequences view of the interior decoration of the building.  As a separate option, you can check with the cablemakers what type of cable they plan to lay and stretch a piece of the building on their own, leaving the tail in the cabinet for unwinding the fibers. <br><br><h4>  Telephony </h4><br>  The complexity of the telephone system depends on the scale of the company and budget.  Again consider a number of options: <br><ol><li>  Basement / apartment and five employees.  You will need the copper of a city telephone provider and a fax of the ‚ÄúPanasonic‚Äù system, which also plays the role of a telephone :) </li><li>  The same, but there is no urban copper: the organization of SIP-telephony (including with soft-backgrounds), or the use of the same Panasonic and provider equipment that wraps the city line in IP from the provider and performs the reverse transformation in you </li><li>  Own telephone exchange accepting a city and carrying out switching within the office.  This option - we will consider in more detail. </li></ol><br>  City lines can be obtained by several methods: <br><ul><li>  Copper pairs (one number - one pair) </li><li>  Sip </li><li>  E1 flow (or part of flow) </li></ul><br>  Copper is usually inherited.  It is difficult from the point of view of switching (everyone saw a terrible picture of plinths wired into the wiring? I cannot find it ..) and it‚Äôs very unpleasant that organizing a multi-channel number is not a task for the faint of heart.

      SIP is a very beautiful solution in terms of the cost of a telephone system.  On the one hand, you get all the charm of multi-channel communication, on the other - you save on streaming cards for PBX (or server that performs the functions of a telephone exchange).  At the same time, the number of Linux open-source PBX (Asterisk, SipX) with convenient control is growing every day.  The potential disadvantage of such a solution is dependence on the load of the provider's main channels (during peak hours there may be a delay, interruptions of communication / jitter and a very unpleasant echo).  Similarly, if the internal network switches have low bandwidth or are not able to prioritize traffic, problems can arise inside the office (after all, office switches also sometimes hang / reboot and you sit without connection during these moments). <br><br>  The most bourgeois method is the use of a specialized PBX (or server) that accepts E1 voice and distributes voice to ip and / or specialized and / or analog devices within the office.  This approach is relatively expensive, but it allows you to forget about the dependence of voice quality on the quality of the external Internet.  It is advisable to use hybrid stations that have the ability to connect both ip and system devices that do not use ethernet inside the office, placing such devices at business-critical employees (secretariat, management, key employees) - thus you are insured against problems associated with the operation of the internal office network equipment.  On the other hand, many ip-devices have the ability to power over Ethernet (PoE), which minimizes the number of cables from the subscribers. <br><br>  On Habr√© already described the procedure for installing and commissioning analog PBX Panasonic.  If there is a desire, I can somehow describe the procedure for entering the Avaya IPO500 PBX into battle, which I have the pleasure of exploiting. <br><h4>  Wi-Fi </h4><br>  Similar to the previous paragraph, it all depends on how matured you are: <br><ol><li>  One or two access points at all (it also replaces the cabling around the office).  Cheap and angry, but if someone decided to shake something from torrents, then the network is over :) </li><li> Guest points in the meeting / show rooms / admin room.  Used only when visiting dear guests and, if necessary, pick up a personal laptop. </li><li>  Serious backup wireless network throughout the office </li></ol><br>  When organizing serious Wi-Fi, you will come across the following: <br><ol><li>  Security (encryption is required!).  You will have to (possibly) fight the entire spectrum of attacks on your Wi-fi, ranging from pioneers, freeloaders, to serious guys who, by request of competitors, collect your critical information </li><li>  Stability of communication (remember about torrents, yes?).  The number of access points should be redundant.  If you can afford MiMo, you must allow </li><li>  Manageability (a separate setting for each point is still entertainment). </li></ol><br><blockquote>  Wikipedia: A key component of the 802.11n standard called <a title="MIMO" href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIMO">MIMO</a> (Multiple Input, Multiple Output - Multiple Inputs, Multiple Outputs) provides for the use of spatial multiplexing to simultaneously transmit multiple information flows over one channel, as well as multipath reflection, which ensures that each bit of information is delivered to the corresponding recipient with a low probability of interference and data loss.  It is the ability to simultaneously transmit and receive data that determines the high bandwidth of 802.11n devices. </blockquote><br>  In the case of organizing a large Wi-Fi, it makes sense to think about a specialized controller that provides centralized control of access points and monitors security (identifying, for example, ‚Äúspy‚Äù access points intended to be introduced into your network).  As an example, I can cite the <a title="Ruckus Wireless ZoneDirector 1000" href="http://www.nstel.ru/products/ruckus_wireless/zonedirector_1000/">Ruckus Wireless ZoneDirector 1000</a> (I had the opportunity to <a title="Ruckus Wireless ZoneDirector 1000" href="http://www.nstel.ru/products/ruckus_wireless/zonedirector_1000/">test</a> it myself) or the Cisco <a title="Cisco 4400 Wireless LAN Controller" href="http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/ps6366/index.html">4400</a> or <a title="Cisco 2100 Wireless LAN Controller" href="http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/ps7206/index.html">2100</a> series. <br><br>  Phew  For this time, it seems, is enough.  Next time - security in the office. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/57663/">https://habr.com/ru/post/57663/</a></p>
