What other surprises can mobile marketing bring in the new year? <br> <b><br></b>  <b>1. Quick Response (QR) Codes</b> <br>  <b>Pros:</b> In 2012, we will witness the disappearance of non-standard formats, the exponential growth of ‚Äúsmart‚Äù mobile devices and the steady movement to improve calls to action (call-to-action), caused by more accurate analytics data. <br><br>  <b>Cons:</b> Marketers tend to use QR codes in a wide variety of campaigns, but they often do it wrong.  Bad specialists continue to blame the tools and repeat simple mistakes that disappoint consumers again and again. <br><br>  QR codes are already being used in Russia.  The domestic operator MTS has already begun to put QR codes on price tags at points of sale, as well as use them in the online store. <br>  One of the most unexpected actions with the use of a QR code was the initiative of the State Darwin Museum in Moscow, which placed a large code right in front of the entrance instead of a poster for events. <br>  Serious hopes on the codes and lays Yandex.  According to the latest information, the Russian Internet company is going to link Yandex.Money to the codes, which will make it easier to make purchases online many times. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Whether you love or hate QR codes, they will gradually become more and more ubiquitous and useful in various fields, including marketing and advertising.  One can only hope that marketers learn how to use them correctly.

      We decided to ask a question about the future of QR codes to <b>Oleg Vakhromeev</b> , controller of peripheral connections in <a href="http://redmadrobot.ru/">REDMADROBOT</a> .  According to Oleg, QR codes really become omnipresent, it is a fact.  But at the moment all over the world a situation has arisen with them when the supply clearly exceeds demand.  What seems obvious to marketers is not at all obvious to consumers.  According to a study by the Russell Herder marketing agency, despite the fact that 72% of consumers surveyed have seen QR codes at least once in their life, 30% of them do not even know what it is.  And only every third out of 10 active QR users says that the result obtained during the use of the code <a href="http://www.marketingcharts.com/direct/3-in-10-consumers-lack-qr-code-understanding-19591/">was worth it</a> .  There is a suspicion that in Russia the real awareness of the audience on how to use QR codes is even lower. <br><br> <b><br></b>  <b>2. Augmented Reality (AR)</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/69a/e26/92a/69ae2692afaab4c00847ae9476d257e7.jpg" alt="image" align="right"><br>  <b>Pros:</b> Due to the rapid growth of mobile devices, AR-campaign is a big success.  They will succeed in capturing the imagination of their consumers. <br><br>  <b>Cons:</b> In 2012, many will be engaged in the development of AR-applications.  Therefore, a lot of low-grade products are waiting for us, as it used to be with QR codes.  The situation is aggravated by the fact that there is no clear definition of augmented reality, and it is often very difficult for marketers to determine what the consumer expects. <br><br>  Augmented reality can be found already in Russia.  One example was the campaign held by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DxV-euU8hZGM">Audi Moscow</a> . <br><br>  As <b>Oleg Vakhromeev</b> told us, augmented reality is a combination of technologies that can be used for marketing purposes.  It can be virtual layouts for <a href="http://vimeo.com/14578243">exhibitions</a> and <a href="http://vimeo.com/25664308">BTL ‚Äì actions</a> , it can be virtual fitting rooms for online stores and showrooms.  A promising direction of development is also <a href="http://redmadrobot.ru/projects/">mobile augmented reality</a> , which allows you to read virtual information using smartphones.  In 2012, most likely, there will be a diversification of projects related to augmented reality, and a transition from the potential capabilities of technology to specific boxed proposals with a clearly marked price tag, which will greatly simplify the life of marketers.  In Russia, in fact, augmented reality is developing quite rapidly: it can be found in museums, at exhibitions, in digital, BTL and mobile campaigns.  Even Russian outdoor advertising operators are thinking about the introduction of augmented reality on advertising surfaces, along with QR codes, so that everything will be fine. <br><br>  <b>3. Near Field Communication (NFC)</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/66b/8ce/a69/66b8cea69b88427008501378f86421f7.jpg" align="left" alt="image"><br>  <b>Pros:</b> Mobile wallets are now in the center of attention, and the main struggle will unfold among the suppliers of equipment necessary for the implementation of NFC.  For example, equipment is expected to appear that allows only a SIM card to be replaced for NFC use, instead of upgrading an entire mobile phone.  Initially, NFC campaigns will be conducted using QR codes. <br><br>  <b>Cons:</b> Total NFC penetration will remain below normal.  Growth in poorly designed marketing companies is also expected.  And increased competition in this area puts at risk the possibility of cross-compatibility of NFC standards. <br><br>  Russia is trying to keep up with the West.  Already, thanks to the project of Aeroexpress, tickets for electric trains from railway stations to Moscow airports can be purchased using a mobile phone with NFC functionality.  And the Russian mobile operator MTS provided an opportunity for holders of 300 special SIM-cards (including employees of the company and employees of the metro) to test the fare payment system in the Moscow metro using NFC technology <br><br>  <b>4. Radio Frequency Identification (RFID)</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e66/7ea/1b1/e667ea1b16ae3a36abbd7b690ea163b1.jpg" alt="image" align="right"><br>  RFID is a technology for automatic contactless identification of objects using a radio frequency communication channel.  The identification of objects is carried out using a unique digital code read from the memory of the electronic tag attached to the identification object. <br><br>  <a href="http://redkeds.com/">Red Keds</a> producer <b>Ilya Ryzhkov</b> and <b>account manager Alexey Bodrov</b> shared their opinions on RFID with us: <br><br>  <b>Pros:</b> Initially, RFID technology has found widespread use in access control systems. <br>  RFID is a good way to identify users of a system. <br>  If we talk about advertising, today RFID is successfully used in offline events. <br>  Thanks to unique tags, we have the opportunity to find out who uses the system and when. <br>  And if you bind a user‚Äôs profile from a social network to a user‚Äôs label, you can successfully link offline activities with the online environment. <br>  <a href="http://vimeo.com/34340887">RFID-projects</a> have already been implemented in <a href="http://vimeo.com/26466044">Russia</a> . <br><br>  <b>Minuses:</b> <br>  Preliminary registration of the user is necessary in order to link his personal information with his personal tag (bracelet, card, key chain). </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/137002/">https://habr.com/ru/post/137002/</a></p>
