  <section class="page js-page"><h1>100 days of curiosity</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> November 16th is a landmark date for the Mars exploration program.  The largest and most modern rover MSL Curiosity spent on the surface of the fourth planet 100 Martian days - solo.  Sol is only 40 minutes longer than Earth‚Äôs day, so the difference with Earth time is insignificant.  For 100 days, it is customary to sum up the preliminary results of the activity, which we will try to do. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2b7/f4f/896/2b7f4f89658bac3d2daec1168dee08e3.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Today, our knowledge of Mars is based mainly on data collected from orbit: over the past ten years, there have been three American satellites, one European, and several more flew past.  The land rovers, despite their heroic and record efforts, did not produce such a revolution as, for example, the stationary Phoenix Lander, which, with several movements of its bucket, put an end to the question of whether there is water on Mars. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/249/7c6/e46/2497c6e465fd1e800a1c1d89c4807b61.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  But Phoenix was directed from the satellite - sending it to where the water should have been.  Likewise, <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/158565/">Opportunity is</a> now <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/158565/">looking for ancient clay</a> where the satellite indicated. <br>  That is, most of our knowledge about Mars was obtained remotely. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/283/1de/939/2831de9395e53b51e1b343f4edc761e9.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Now mankind needed to clarify and structure their knowledge.  For this, the mission of MSL was collected.  I say "humanity", not "America", because  Curiosity collected on the road all over the world.  The alpha-ray X-ray spectrometer was made (and paid $ 17 million) by Canadians.  Laser and camera ChemCam - the French.  Climate sensor REMS - Spaniards.  Roscosmos has contributed to the DAN neutron detector, which is looking for hydrogen = water under the rover.  Australians and Spaniards provide their radars to maintain contact with the rover, when the rotation of the Earth closes Mars from the United States (the rotation of Mars restricts direct communication sessions to 16 hours).  In short, if anyone has information that the rover rides in the Mexican desert, contact here: <a href="http://www.federalspace.ru/main.php%3Fid%3D7">www.federalspace.ru/main.php?id=7</a> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7bc/950/db2/7bc950db2e233e28031c53bc12d89724.jpg" alt="image">

      In order to get maximum information about Mars from the surface, it took a very careful approach to the choice of the landing site.  Even a powerful and large rover can not explore the entire planet, whose area is almost equal to the land area on Earth.  It was necessary to choose a promising place in geological terms to explore the evolution of the planet throughout its history and in all periods.  An important place is given to the search for evidence of the existence of a climatic era on Mars that favored the emergence and development of life.  In addition, it was necessary to adapt to the technical capabilities of the landing system and the rover itself.  For example, all the geological layers can certainly be found within the walls of the Mariner valley, but the rover will not be able to climb a vertical slope of several kilometers, so this place is no longer there.  For the descent capsule and parachute, the density of air is important, so places above 1 km from the average level also disappear - it will not have time to slow down.  Therefore, of the 30 possible options, first selected 4 of the most "delicious", and then stopped at the Gale crater. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4d6/14f/9d5/4d614f9d5df7c9c68f8007dc790cf077.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Gale's crater is interesting for its mountain Sharpe, as NASA calls it, or Eulida, as the International Astronomical Union insists.  Some Russian grief expert <a href="http://www.ng.ru/science/2012-10-10/9_marsohod.html">wondered</a> why Curiosity was climbing up the hill, because it wasn‚Äôt just flying behind alpinist success.  But if you look carefully, the mountain is a layer cake over 3 billion years old from layers of different times.  At the same time, in ancient times, the cake was neatly incised by a stream of water, which provided a convenient ramp for lifting up and sequential study of all layers.  This study, with the scientific arsenal that Curiosity carries on itself, should provide such a volume of knowledge that can be compared with all the knowledge about Mars accumulated so far. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/017/f6f/113/017f6f11345cfefd366447fa832d1447.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  But 100 days have passed, but the revolution has not been heard.  Yes, the rover found traces of water flow, investigated a curious stone, made a <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/157181/">bow on the mountain</a> .  Can this be called revolutionary results? <br><br>  Let's try to figure it out. <br>  To begin with, the actual Curiosity has not yet reached the mountain.  It‚Äôs about eight kilometers to the planned point of ascent, but for now it has passed 450 meters. So, the main stream of scientific data will start well if from the middle of 2013.  The main case, which was completed in 100 days, is tested and tested in practice, almost all the tools and instruments of the rover.  The exception leaves only a drill, but also business will soon reach it. <br><br>  I'll tell you more about his arsenal and first results. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ab4/bde/17e/ab4bde17e89c9676cbded0c610c9902e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Curiosity color cameras, from the NASA point of view, are scientific tools, not a means to entertain taxpayers.  James Cameron made efforts to fly two identical cameras with a variable focal length.  This would allow Avatar-2 to be shot on Mars.  And NASA even went to meet it - the cameras were ordered and practically made, but did not fit the deadlines, so the previously planned cameras flew: two two-megapixel Mast Cam with a fixed focal length of one 34, the second 100 mm.  Accordingly, the first covers a wider viewing angle, the second - sees further.  Although if you wish, you can make quite good anaglyphs from their frames <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7c1/d15/a86/7c1d15a86921cd2a9c884dd3255b41d6.jpg" alt="image"><br>  (You can find cool anaglyph panoramas of Mars on VKontakte #MarsAnaglyph) <br><br>  The left 34mm camera was tested on the third day after landing - it took a <a href="http://gigapan.com/gigapans/113071">color panorama</a> to the delight of the public.  From the second there were certain problems.  During the first weeks, she persistently sent black and white photographs and, as I understood, they were not the goal of NASA.  Then everything worked out and now she clicks, not <a href="http://gigapan.com/gigapans/118482">ceasing almost every day</a> . <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ebd/4f1/42e/ebd4f142ea63272f4cf8ef27b0da4227.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Color camera MAHLI was not immediately involved.  It settles down on the manipulator, and the rover developed a hand already after several hundreds meters passed.  And the first test shots she did through the dust filter.  Unlike other cameras, there is not a disposable cap, but a real hatch. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/55a/421/262/55a4212624312d0162c08bf4c31f55ff.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The image quality is simply amazing: it shows details up to a fraction of a millimeter and can act as a microscope.  She often takes stereoscopic images from which anaglyphs can be made and shoots in infra-red light. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/comment_images/46c/9bd/f22/46c9bdf221f8d5bacb86ce334d645192.jpg" alt="image"><br>  (This is a stone, and a strange shine from the LED backlight) <br><br>  The ChemCam laser was quickly put into operation and is now working without rest.  Scientists do not have enough point data; they shoot in bursts without saving ammunition.  However, according to the RTG specifications, the ‚Äúcartridges‚Äù for the laser should be enough for 14 years.  The laser heats the target to the plasma state, the ChemCam camera-telescope captures the flash light and the spectrometer determines the composition of the luminous substance. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ecb/581/e4a/ecb581e4ac2ba7b5635b4512e0ae8044.jpg" alt="image"><br>  (vertical line - from laser ‚Äúqueue‚Äù) <br><br>  I must say about the quality of photos ChemCam.  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãusing a telescope-reflector for macro photography is not the most successful, especially without a flashlight.  But, firstly, the metal plate of the mirror meets the high requirements of the reliability of the rover, and secondly, the camera does an excellent job with its scientific purpose: aiming up to 7 meters and delivering plasma light to the spectrograph. <br><br>  These devices were in the "first tier" - they meet scientific mysteries from afar.  For them, the rover is taken manually using an APXS instrument (alpha-ray X-ray spectrometer). <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7ea/3e7/762/7ea3e776237ebe1f7b7190d6dcbb0502.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Such devices were on all the rovers since Sojourner, but with Curiosity it is perfect, so it carries out tests several times faster than its predecessors.  The device is located on the manipulator, it presses against the sample, irradiates it with alpha rays, it starts to emit in the X-ray range and the emission spectrum analyzes the spectrometer.  ChemCam and APXS were paired on the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/154517/">Jake Matievich</a> stone and revealed its volcanic origin. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4db/98c/e0d/4db98ce0d37d33bb270bd9a687c0308b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  External devices of a mars rover are not limited to geological.  The REMS climate sensor and radiation RAD collect information on external physical conditions.  RAD is directly claimed as a device that collects information for a future manned expedition to Mars. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0f7/af3/92d/0f7af392d2c9b2d714f0cf822123e608.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  At the beginning of the expedition, the first malfunction was revealed - one of the two wind sensors failed.  For this reason, Curiosity has problems with determining the direction of the air flow.  In addition to wind sensors, REMS includes a sensor for air temperature, surface temperature and atmospheric pressure.  Daily weather reports from Mars are available at: <a href="http://cab.inta-csic.es/rems/marsweather.html">cab.inta-csic.es</a> <br>  Together, the devices provide interesting information about how the atmospheric pressure, air and soil temperature vary during the day and for long periods of time. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/85f/693/665/85f6936655695b9d905b74b8e96618c3.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Only today they demonstrated an interesting moment caught by the instruments: for a few seconds the pressure dropped sharply, and a gust of wind was recorded.  NASA experts have determined that this happened when a small whirlwind hit the rover - dust devil, which had been watched several times by previous devices, even satellites, but had never seen Curiosity before. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d21/e73/473/d21e7347302bb8beb5bb58aadd63a23a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  An interesting observation was made for 60 solos, an atmospheric pressure sensor.  Although the dynamics of daily fluctuations during this time has not changed, the absolute indicator of pressure has increased.  This is the result of spring changes - warm weather causes increased evaporation of carbon dioxide in the South polar cap, and the total atmosphere increases, and with it the pressure on the entire planet. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/fd5/dfb/ebd/fd5dfbebdf7dba3a347ba0fff16f6436.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The RAD radiation sensor allows you to capture all types of ionizing radiation, which can only fall on the Martian surface from space.  In fact, it is not just a dosimeter, but a radiation telescope.  He revealed other curious details. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0f1/d20/baa/0f1d20baae78c509df40dff9bc56daba.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The amount of exposure during the day naturally fluctuates depending on the position of the sun relative to the Martian surface.  During the day, the intensity increases;  But for all the time of observation, it was possible to fix periods of 27 days.  They reflect the daily rotation of the sun, i.e.  different parts of the solar surface emit at different intensities.  Of course, for scientists this is not news, but seeing this dynamic from Mars is in itself unusual. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/656/f38/d59/656f38d59f61683e8ecfd1df2bef4a7e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The Russian DAN detector was in operation during the entire run of the rover.  True, the results were published only in the first days - according to Russian experts, the water at the landing site was ‚Äúno more than in the concrete floor‚Äù.  But, apparently, there is simply nothing to talk about.  Now Curiosity lingered on the edge of the lowland, which <a href="http://vk.com/wall-41633702_4343">most likely</a> once was a body of water - there may be more hydrated materials at the bottom and DAN will please discoveries. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/384/95f/779/38495f779e827f7ca3e652e6989b5653.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Two of the most promising and most advanced instruments have been tested in practice: CheMin is a <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/154691/">chemical and mineralogical instrument</a> , and SAM is a device for analyzing Martian samples.  Both of them are located inside the housing of the rover, and the samples are loaded with a manipulator.  CheMin allows you to accurately determine the mineral composition of the sample, to study its crystal lattice and chemical composition.  Trial results of his work have already been <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/156771/">made public</a> , and recently the next sample was loaded into it, but from the same heap of sand. <br><br>  SAM is generally an incredible device for its size.  A microwave-sized box includes a quadrupole mass spectrometer, a gas chromatograph, and a tunable laser spectrometer.  The main task of SAM is to search for the ‚Äúbuilding blocks of life‚Äù - hydrocarbon compounds that are precursors of life, past or present. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/cd9/301/584/cd9301584ae1641ab11dce452832ce54.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  All three devices investigate gaseous environments, therefore SAM studies everything gaseous, and what is not gaseous it heats up to 1000 ¬∞ C and studies as gaseous.  Yes, there is a stove too.  SAM determines the atomic mass of a substance, measures the isotopic content, and determines the chemical composition.  This unique device requires a separate story.  He had already studied the Martian air and started on the ground.  All this design absorbs almost all of the available energy of the rover, so now very few photos are being sent - Curiosity fries Mars. <br><br>  As a result, in 100 days we learned that the first goal of the mission has been achieved - the rover is on the surface, all the main systems are working normally, the machine is a beast, and Mars must be studied! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/cad/5d7/ed7/cad5d7ed7bcbada5657df869c80d3e5e.jpg" alt="image"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/158877/">https://habr.com/ru/post/158877/</a></p>
