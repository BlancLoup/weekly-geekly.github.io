Sudoku has been solved, musical puzzles have been deciphered, origami has been folded, and dragons have been defeated.  In all, nearly half a million Dropquest members were rewarded for their cunning, skill and effort.  It was more than a year ago, and we still hid our cards and came up with new puzzles to make a decent receiver to the first quest, Dropquest. <br><br><h4>  Here is what we want to tell you about the upcoming Dropquest next week. </h4><br><ul><li>  The quest is back. </li><li>  It will become even more difficult. </li><li>  It will be even more epic. </li></ul><br><a name="habracut"></a><h4>  What is Dropquest? </h4><br>  Dropquest is a multi-step puzzle game on which you have to complete a series of puzzles (we were inspired by <a href="http://web.mit.edu/puzzle/www/">MIT's Mystery Hunt</a> and <a href="http://notpron.org/notpron/">Notpron</a> ).  Everyone who completes Dropquest will receive at least 1 GB of additional space on Dropbox, even if you participated last year.  Everyone will start the quest at the same time, but those who pass it will quickly receive amazing prizes: <br><br><ul><li>  <b>1st place (1 participant)</b> - a hooded sweatshirt from Dropbox, a T-shirt from Dropbox from <a href="http://blog.dropbox.com/%3Fp%3D1062">Hack Week</a> , a picture drawn by the entire Dropbox team, an invitation to help in developing the next Dropquest, <b>100 GB of</b> additional space in Dropbox for life. </li><li>  <b>2nd place (10 participants)</b> - a Dropbox hoodie, a Dropbox T-shirt, <b>20 GB of</b> extra space for life. </li><li>  <b>3rd place (15 participants)</b> - T-shirt from Dropbox, <b>5 GB of</b> extra space for life. </li><li>  <b>4th place (50 participants)</b> - <b>2 GB of</b> additional space for life. </li><li>  <b>5th place (100 participants)</b> - <b>1 GB of</b> additional space for life. </li></ul><br><h4>  More rules? </h4><br>  This year we will not provide additional support; we ask you not to publish decisions and prompts on forums and blogs.  In fact, if we find out that you are doing this, then you will be disqualified.

    <h4>  When will the quest begin? </h4><br>  <b>On Saturday, May 12, 17:00 GMT (21:00 Moscow time and 20:00 Kiev time)</b> . <br>  Do not be late. <br><br>  Link to the quest: <a href="http://www.dropbox.com/dropquest2012">www.dropbox.com/dropquest2012</a> (will not work until Dropquest starts). <br><br><h4>  More questions </h4><br>  <b>Wait, you said it will be even harder?</b>  Yes, we have a lot of difficult puzzles in store that will require even more insight and creative solutions, and many puzzles this year will require you to plunge into the quest a few layers deeper.  Invite your friends ( <a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/2975/Dropquest%25202011-01/chat.html">The winners of last year‚Äôs quest definitely recommend you do this!</a> ), But just remember that one key doesn‚Äôt fit every door this year ... <br><br>  <b>Wow, that will be too hard!</b>  We will periodically issue tips for each step to help you.  But use them at your own risk. <br><br>  <b>How long does Dropquest take this year?</b>  Let's be honest, we do not know!  There are many factors on which it depends, so it is quite difficult to say.  The last Dropquest ended a little less than 2 hours after launch, but the Black-ops team doubts that the new quest will be resolved in less than 5 hours, do not hesitate to prove to them the opposite. <br><br>  <b>What do I need to participate in the quest?</b>  Most of the puzzles, if not all, can be solved with an Internet browser, pencil and paper.  Although not required, we highly recommend <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/install">downloading and installing the Dropbox application on your computer</a> .  Several puzzles will occur in your Dropbox, and the installed client will allow you to solve them faster.  We can say for sure that there will be no need to use the printer this time (sorry, origami fans!). <br><br>  <b>What happens when I win extra Dropbox space?</b>  You should know that your current account type (for example, Basic, Pro 50, Pro 100) will not change.  Additional space will be added only to your account, so you can not transfer it to anyone or sell it.  You use Dropbox according to the rules described here: <a href="http://www.dropbox.com/terms">www.dropbox.com/terms</a> <br><br>  <b>How was Dropquest created?</b>  Dropquest was written and coined by two members of the Black-ops team, and this is the result of a very scary week of <a href="http://blog.dropbox.com/%3Fp%3D1062">Hack Week</a> , where employees got a whole week to work on any project they wanted to implement.  In our plans to present a new quest after each week of Hack Week.  To learn more about why Dropbox is a truly incredible and convenient place to work, <a href="http://www.dropbox.com/jobs">visit our page</a> . <br><br><h4>  Links </h4><br><ul><li>  <a href="http://blog.dropbox.com/%3Fp%3D1194">A source</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.dropbox.com/">Dropbox</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://blog.dropbox.com/%3Fp%3D1062">Hack Week</a> </li></ul><br><h4>  Getting ready </h4><br>  This time will be even harder.  The Dropbox team hints that one key will no longer fit all doors, so the tasks for each may differ. <br><br><h4>  Addition </h4><br>  Everyone who passes the quest will receive 1 GB of additional space. <br>  For example, if you get to 5th place, you will get another 1 GB and in the end there will be 2 GB. <br><br>  This is my first free translation, please send comments in PM. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/143207/">https://habr.com/ru/post/143207/</a></p>
