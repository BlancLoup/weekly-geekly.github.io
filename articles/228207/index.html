  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The first year at the VIC</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello!  My first summer session has come to an end and I would like to tell you about the first year of study at the faculty of the Moscow Medical University.  On Habr√© several years ago there was <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/73279/">an article</a> about it.  She wrote a graduate SUNTs MSU.  I, in turn, is a graduate of an ordinary Moscow language school (that is, a humanitarian). <br><br>  So, the IUD is not mathematic. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Arrival </h4><br>  For admission to the ISC, you must pass five items: <br><br><ul><li>  Russian (EGE) </li><li>  Mathematics (EGE) </li><li>  Physics (EGE) </li><li>  Informatics (EGE) </li><li>  DVI (additional entrance test) in mathematics </li></ul>
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>

          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      I can not say that the flow came to me with great difficulty.  I acted without olympiads.  Only by the exam and DVI.  In my year, the passing score was 425 and I entered with a margin of 21 points, in the first wave. <br><br><h4>  Subjects </h4><br>  In the first semester, we had 8 subjects: <br><br><ul><li>  Mathematical analysis (2 lectures, 2 seminars) </li><li>  Linear algebra and Analytic geometry (2 lectures, 2 seminars) </li><li>  Algorithms and algorithmic languages ‚Äã‚Äã(2 lectures) </li><li>  Fatherland History (1 lecture and 1 seminar) </li><li>  computer workshop (2 workshops) </li><li>  OBZH (1 seminar) </li><li>  physical education (2 classes) </li><li>  English (2 workshops) </li></ul><br><br>  In the first four, exams and tests are taken at the end of the semester.  On a practical test with assessment.  For the remaining three - only offsets.  It is worth noting that the course is divided into three streams.  The first stream studies the SI language, the other two - Pascal (your humble servant studies the first).  To be honest, for me the most terrible exam was algebra.  Kills the amount of material you need to know, as much as 90 tickets, but they are, with rare exceptions, not complicated.  Matan has only 30 tickets, we passed a written exam on the algorithms, I had a machine gun on the history, so I can‚Äôt say anything about this exam.  From lessons OBZH, I learned only that in the South-Western Administrative Okrug there are a little more than forty hazardous enterprises. <br><br>  I am glad that there are many opportunities for sports at MSU.  At the beginning of the year, a course is collected where sports are distributed.  At the ISC it is volleyball, basketball, freestyle wrestling, athletics and much more.  If you did not find among this list what you are interested in / need, there are many central sections (yacht club, tourist club, sambo, tennis, downhill skiing, mountain sledding, etc.).  For example, I go to Sambo.  It should be noted that in the central sections you need to walk not twice, but three or more. <br><br>  In the second semester, instead of Algorithmic languages, we study Computer Architecture and Assembly Language (2 lectures), and we also add Discrete Mathematics (2 lectures and 1 seminar).  It is also necessary to choose one humanitarian special course (1 lecture).  Remains physical education, English, a workshop on a computer, matan and linal.  These subjects have the same clock distribution as in semester 1.  Linear algebra becomes more complicated, but the number of tickets decreases.  Matan is also complicated.  So the second session is more complicated than the first one, but students already know what and how, therefore there is less unrest, and as a result, there is more pofigism. <br><br><h4>  Computer science </h4><br>  As I have already said, the course ‚ÄúAlgorithms and Algorithmic Languages‚Äù is taught in the first semester, which, in turn, is divided into three parts.  In the first part of the course, we study the "Turing Machine", "Normal Markov Algorithms" and we prove their equivalence.  In the second part of the course, we study the C language.  The third part of the course is devoted to data structures and algorithms for working with them.  We study the lists, trees and algorithms for working with them.  The first concept of hashes is given.  Reporting form - written exam. <br><br>  In the second semester, we are taught the course ‚ÄúComputer Architecture and Assembly Language‚Äù.  First we study Assembler (NASM).  Then the hardware device of modern computers is studied superficially.  And most of the time, studies of the work of compilers (by the example of gcc) are going on, explain how various syntactic constructions of the SI language are translated into assembler, and some possibilities of program optimization are explained.  It also studies the operation of the cache, teaches about the need to respect the principle of locality of programs.  Reporting form - written exam. <br><br>  Throughout all time, the theoretical knowledge gained at the lectures is consolidated at the seminars.  During these two semesters, we solve problems in the SI and Assembler languages ‚Äã‚Äãand pass them on the Internet; the server has time limitations on the program.  Tasks are not all trivial.  Often it is necessary to look for algorithms that help to keep within the time allotted for the program to work.  Also in the classroom, we solve various problems and write checklists. <br><br><h4>  Advantages and disadvantages </h4><br><ul><li>  Great group.  We have a great team in the group, they all help each other, often go somewhere together.  Everyone has a good sense of humor.  It is very interesting to communicate with the guys. </li><li>  Delicious dining.  At Moscow State University, after the second couple, 45 minutes are given for lunch.  Throughout Moscow State University there are several tasty eateries, at reasonable prices. </li><li>  It is interesting to study. </li><li>  Sometimes annoying tyranny and harmfulness of teachers, their exaggerated demands on students, although it may be for the better? </li><li>  During the controls, we write programs on paper, which is certainly annoying, because it does not allow us to catch any minor errors that you could see after the first start of the compiler, for which you reduce the points.  But when you write programs on your computer, you are no longer mistaken. </li></ul><br><br>  In conclusion, we can say that studying at the VMK is not easy, but extremely interesting. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/228207/">https://habr.com/ru/post/228207/</a></p>
