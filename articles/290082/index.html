But recent research has shown that impressions that inspire us to ‚Äúgrow‚Äù at work are not only a measure of satisfaction from work, but also a measure of self-esteem.  This means that turning personal and professional growth into a life priority can have a huge impact on our well-being and a sense of self-worth.

      ‚ÄúIf you ask people to describe themselves, their profession is at the top of the list.  It is considered one of the central points of human identification, ‚Äùsays Kevin McIntyre, a professor of psychology at the University of Trinity and one of the scientists who conducted a recent study <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/karera/karernye-podskazki-dlya-predstaviteley-pokoleniya-milleniuma-10-sposobov-poluchit-rabotu/">on career advancement</a> .  ‚ÄúThat is why creating at work opportunities for growth and self-improvement is very important.  People really like to grow, ‚Äùnotes McIntyre. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">A good working day is like a happy date.</font> </h2><br>  The study showed that falling in love affects self-esteem in much the same way as having satisfying and inspiring work.  ‚ÄúApart from close relationships, people call their own work the basis of ideas about themselves,‚Äù says MacIntyre.  And, as well as the relationships received at work, impressions can make your life much more prominent. <br><br>  Using data from a previous relationship study, McIntyre and his team discovered an interesting circumstance.  Intimate relationships use the traits of their partners in building a sense of self-worth.  A job can also increase self-esteem if it inspires us to develop skills and expand the range of aspects of our identification.  This can be facilitated by <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/chtoby-stat-liderom-dlya-drugikh-stante-snachala-liderom-dlya-sebya/">promotion to the position of project leader</a> , the acquisition of a new professional skill, or the acquisition of a different, more complex task from the previous ones. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">Take the initiative, and the positive will be more!</font> </h2><br>  But not at every workplace you can find time for personal projects.  So, you need to use an initiative approach to constantly be in search of opportunities for growth and development.  ‚ÄúAcquiring new administrative powers, communicating with different people, or improving the skills or <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/karera/kak-nalazhivat-svyazi-slovno-vy-deystvitelno-znaete-chto-delaete/">skills of social interaction</a> can open up new aspects and perspectives in the daily routine,‚Äù says McIntyre.  These small changes have significant influence. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">If you do not grow, you become counterproductive</font> </h2><br>  Boredom at work is not only exhausting, but, according to scientists, is the reason for the decrease in efficiency.  In the study of productivity, entitled "Bored workers - this is wrong," was found a close link between boredom in the service and poor performance. <br><br>  This is logical.  If you are not fascinated and inspired by the task, you are unlikely to put maximum effort into doing it.  Over time, this will cause serious damage to your performance.  Make an effort to try something new and you want to work more efficiently. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">Even small things are suitable for development</font> </h2><br>  There is no need to completely revise your career or job responsibilities to make your life more meaningful.  In a study published in the Journal of Positive Psychology, participants were asked to carry a ping-pong ball from one end of the room to the other, holding it in their hands or using chopsticks.  Those of them who chose a more interesting and challenging task - with chopsticks, showed a greater desire to fulfill it.  ‚ÄúSometimes only momentous changes matter,‚Äù says McIntyre.  "But sometimes even small portions of new experience can make your life richer." <br><br>  PS We recommend another article on the topic - <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/pyat-zabluzhdeniy-o-produktivnosti-kotorye-my-sebe-vnushaem/">Five misconceptions about productivity, which we inspire.</a> <br><br>  Translated by Vyacheslav Davidenko, founder of <a href="http://www.mbaconsult.ru/">MBA Consult</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/290082/">https://habr.com/ru/post/290082/</a></p>
