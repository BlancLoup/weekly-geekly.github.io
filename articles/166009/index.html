      "In his work, there are shots worthy of a film with a budget of $ 150 million," writes the producer of the film Hurricane Season. <br><br>  But in order. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/26c/877/aa5/26c877aa582b3c715d913dd42637e43f.jpg"><br><br>  Kalebu Lekhovski is only 22 years old and he finished only the first semester at the High School of Media and Design in Berlin.  Twenty-two is a perfectly normal age to start studying in Germany.  Usually, the gymnasium ends by the age of 19, the army or alternative service follows it, and only then does the study begin. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b8f/7eb/1e2/b8f7eb1e27451bff9dad73031ad3f3f7.jpg"><br><br>  During the first semester with the help of computer graphics, he created a short film with a duration of almost 6.5 minutes.  The film received 600 thousand views in the first five days and was so impressed with producer Scott Glezgold that he offered the student a contract. <br>  Probably it's time to watch a movie (turn on Russian subtitles, if suddenly your English is not enough): <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/AQfDg-0cUF4%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,1500004,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700258&amp;usg=ALkJrhh4ZXSuoya-fMbbpLqhrfMTdIZVCA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  It is noteworthy that the entire film, with the exception of music and sound, Caleb made himself.  It took him seven months of work. <br>  In his blog, answering questions from the audience, Caleb writes that the movements of the alien in the film Ra were traced by hand, and not recreated using motion capture technology (Motion Capture). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c88/dda/33f/c88dda33f2893b113ee485a773440b3e.jpg"><br><br>  But Caleb‚Äôs answer to another question seemed to me the most interesting (translation is close to the text): <br><br><blockquote>  Question: Hi, I am 20 years old and for three years I just can‚Äôt choose a direction in which I would like to develop further.  I have always loved art and design, but I‚Äôm afraid to choose them as a career.  Tell me please, have you ever doubted your future?  Have you always been sure that you want to become an artist? </blockquote><br><br><blockquote>  Answer: There were ups and downs.  People always liked my creativity, but at school I considered myself a good middling.  Therefore, I believed that it was unrealistic and seriously wanted to go to study industrial design.  But people were constantly wondering why I did not go to study cinematographic art and animation, since I am so passionate about all this.  I myself thought a lot about it, so I went to study animation in Berlin.  I realized that industrial design was not for me and that I wanted to stay in Berlin as soon as I got there. <br><br>  I think that as long as you do not give up trying to find yourself, you will find your way.  And if you sit back, nothing will happen. <br><br>  You can always change your direction. <br><br>  All the best <br>  Caleb </blockquote><br><br>  In the near future, the student will go to Hollywood to present his work and receive the necessary funding.  It is possible that after some time the film Ra (R'ha) will appear at the box office.  Caleb‚Äôs cooperation agreement is in his hands.  However, even the approximate terms of the contract I could not find. <br><br>  <b>Links</b> : <a href="http://kaleblechowski.tumblr.com/">kaleblechowski.tumblr.com</a> <a href="http://mashable.com/2013/01/14/rha-sci-fi-short/">mashable</a> <a href="http://www.tagesschau.de/tageswebschau/">ard.de, mentioning a contract</a> , but referring to mashable in mention </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/166009/">https://habr.com/ru/post/166009/</a></p>
