Although these devices have become quite affordable, they are still expensive.  The cheapest Chinese version, today, will cost you 700-800 American money and it probably will not work out of the box right away, but will require an effort to bring it to mind.  The manufacture of a CNC machine can cost less on its own, but usually requires access to various types of woodworking and metalworking equipment and the ability to use it to produce parts with high precision. <br><br>  But people are always looking for ways to achieve goals with affordable means. <a name="habracut"></a><br>  In some tasks for CNC machines, namely when it is necessary to repeat the same detail many times, the pantograph invented in 1603 by <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A8%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B9%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580,_%25D0%259A%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D1%2584">Christoph Scheiner</a> - a device for copying maps, plans and other vector drawings, can help.

In the second, a writing instrument is fixed, which, through a system of levers and hinges, repeats the movements of the first vertex by drawing a copy on the second sheet.  Often, the pantographs incorporated the function of scaling the original image. <br><br>  Simple and ingenious idea.  Now, and how to copy a certain volume object?  To do this, add a Z-coordinate to the pantograph and replace the pencil with a drill, or better high-speed spindle, and we will get a 3D pantograph. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1aa/a71/3a2/1aaa713a201846c3b10d510bdf57d773.png"><br><br>  Machines for copying wooden products on such a principle are produced for example by the American firm <a href="http://wood-carver.com/unispecs.html">Gemini</a> and only their prices are such that for this money you can buy a good CNC machine from China.  Therefore, what the DIY community has achieved in this area is more interesting. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dd0/2b5/729/dd02b57298694e528a8650bcc20f24b8.jpg"><br><br>  Frank Ford (Frank Ford) is engaged in the manufacture of acoustic guitars.  At the same time, he has to make many identical guitar parts, such as string holders.  Charter to do it manually, but not wanting to bother with the purchase and adjustment of the CNC, he made for himself a <a href="http://www.frets.com/FretsPages/Luthier/Tools/3DCarver/carver1.html">duplicator</a> .  Since  he was important high accuracy of copying, his tool is made entirely of metal.  The stylus, which removes the form and the spindle is fixed on a common frame, which moves only along the Z axis. Movement along the X and Y axes is carried out using the table on which the workpieces are fixed.  Another original in its design is that, as a spindle, it uses a pneumatic drive operating at 40,000 rpm. <br><br>  Nevertheless, even though it is a self-made, but still expensive version of the 3D pantograph.  There are cheaper. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/094/de6/164/094de6164dad4e28b7f9aeed803e2a20.jpg"><br><br>  For example, Adran (Adran), dreaming about his own CNC machine, but without the means to do so.  He designed himself a duplicator from a Dremel drill, three metal guides and wooden slats of standard sizes from the store.  A standard screwdriver is used as a probe.  Its design can be easily repeated, because  He posted the <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Dremel-CarverDuplicator-like-a-Human-Power-CNC-Ro/%3FALLSTEPS">drawings and all the manufacturing steps</a> on the Instructables website. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b6d/1ca/b45/b6d1cab459004d02914880f47f344d69.jpg"><br><br>  However, the manual drill, not the most successful tool for such work, the speed of removal of material from her is too small.  Here Matthias Wandel from Canada used a hand router in <a href="http://woodgears.ca/pantograph/">his 3D pantograph</a> .  What gave him enough power to quickly copy items in the tree.  As an example of working with such a duplicator, here is his video, where he makes a copy of the form of an old dial telephone (English). <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/LyNu8lpQI1g%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhizFIT2iRHjJxhO37BD8vZn20ur3Q" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Its design can also be repeated, because  He posted the <a href="http://woodgears.ca/pantograph/build.html">blueprints and manufacturing instructions</a> on his website Woodgears.ca.  Even if you are not friends with English, there you can easily understand the whole process from numerous photographs. <br><br>  If the topic of 3D pantographs interested you, then on English-language resources examples of such devices can be found by tags: carving duplicator, duplicarver, pantorouter. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/374957/">https://habr.com/ru/post/374957/</a></p>
