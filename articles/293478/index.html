Sometimes deadlines are not realistic.  A possible reason is that the task was not designed, it was not divided into stages.  It is difficult to set deadlines based only on intuition and experience. <br><br>  To me, as a website developer, such tasks come across.  The deadlines for these tasks are set on the basis of business requirements.  I will share my experience - how, under narrow deadlines, it was possible to successfully implement the requirements of a business. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I cite tips that I myself am guided by and which have helped me out more than once.  Each statement requires discussion, reflection and criticism. <br>  The tone of the article seems to be categorical.  Immediately apologize for that.  For the sake of brevity, I omitted the phrases ‚ÄúI think,‚Äù ‚ÄúI suppose,‚Äù and so on. <br><br>  I will share experience on the basis of an example.  Let's invent the following task.  Figures and terms conditional.

      We are developing an e-commerce site that sells children's toys.  Payment in cash only.  We realize cashless payments with the help of: <br><ul><li>  PayPal; </li><li>  Yandex.Money; </li><li>  QIWI Wallet; </li></ul><br><br>  The manager has set a deadline - a week. <br>  You rummaged in the ready-made code, studied the architecture, thought about these requirements.  They remembered that 5 more tasks are hanging on us, which no one has canceled.  And realized that in a timely manner you can not cope. <br>  You approached the manager, explained the situation.  The manager responded as follows: <br><ul><li>  Tasks are urgent, have time to do </li><li>  Ok, I will pause 2 tasks.  The remaining 3 tasks are performed in parallel </li><li>  Ok, I will extend this task for 1.5 weeks </li></ul><br><br>  These options do not suit you.  There is not enough time.  You were at an impasse and thought about these decisions: <br><ul><li>  come to work early. </li><li>  stay longer at work. </li><li>  You are constantly lingering anyway, you will have to linger 2 times longer. </li></ul><br><br>  <b>How to be?</b> <br>  Here will help the book by Stephen R. Covey <a href="http://www.ozon.ru/context/detail/id/4749424/">"7 skills of highly effective people"</a> <br><br><ol><li>  Be proactive </li><li>  Starting, imagine the ultimate goal. </li><li>  First do what you need to do first </li><li>  Think in the spirit of winning - won </li></ol><br><br>  <i>Be proactive</i> - suggest a solution to the problem.  Some managers even have a corresponding sign hanging on the door ‚Äúdo not enter without suggestions‚Äù. <br><br>  <i>Starting, imagine the ultimate goal</i> - the ultimate goal here is not to solve the problem, but to satisfy the current needs of the business. <br>  <i>First, do what you need to do first</i> - this is the solution to the problem.  Independently find out the priorities and divide the task into stages! <br><br>  <i>Think in the spirit of winning - winning</i> - phasing will allow you to release a ready-made function even earlier than the deadline.  The manager is more willing to accept a proposal for the stages if he gets the necessary function early. <br><br>  Let us also recall the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum">definition of the Scrum-methodology</a> - this is a set of principles allowing in rigidly fixed and short-term iterations to provide the end user with working software with new features for which the highest priority is defined. <br><br>  Actions such: <br><ol><li>  We divide the task into subtasks - a proactive approach.  Do not ask the manager, do it yourself. </li><li>  We find out the priorities of each subtask. </li><li>  We break a task into stages. </li><li>  Together with the manager, we adjust the timing. </li><li>  Gradually solve a big task. </li></ol><br><br>  Subtasks turned out such: <br><ol><li>  implement paypal, </li><li>  realize yandex money </li><li>  implement QIWI wallet </li></ol><br><br>  The manager adjusts the list of subtasks.  Priorities were set based on the percentage of customers who would like to use payment systems.  Got the following steps: <br><ol><li>  Yandex.Money 60% of users </li><li>  QIWI Wallet 30% of users </li><li>  PayPal - 10% of users. </li></ol><br><br>  Together with the manager set the following dates: <br><ol><li>  Yandex.Money - 3 days </li><li>  QIWI Wallet - 4 days </li><li>  PayPal - 2 days. </li></ol><br><br>  <b>Results:</b> <br><br>  It turned out that we do not hope to solve the problem in a week, but much earlier we will release a useful function for clients. <br><br>  The splitting into stages I showed on a simple task.  In practice, the tasks are much more difficult, there are more stages; managers do not agree with the proposal.  For justification we use UML diagrams. <br><br>  The diagrams clearly show that the task is complex, each element contains many details and features.  Based on such a visual description, you justify why it is impossible to implement the task in a timely manner. <br>  The timing of the performance of individual elements is estimated more precisely by the timing of the performance of a large task. <br><br>  <b>Findings:</b> <br><ol><li>  Instead of excuses and complaints for inadequate terms, you proposed a constructive solution - break the task into stages. </li><li>  With the help of diagrams, you proved the complexity of the task and proved that this task is divided into stages. </li><li>  The manager is satisfied - the first release (stage 1) took place ahead of schedule, useful documentation appeared. </li><li>  You improved your communication skills with management, avoided inadequate deadlines and big rework. </li><li>  You have improved your design and documentation skills by providing some kind of ready-made solution that your experienced colleague has improved. </li><li>  The work has become more interesting - you have learned additional information about the project (user priorities) </li></ol><br><br>  <b>Conclusions in the form of tips:</b> <br><ol><li>  Come with a ready solution.  You will receive an additional bonus - errors are corrected. </li><li>  Do not spend a lot of time splitting tasks into subtasks.  Meaning - to prepare a draft for discussion. </li><li>  Do not proceed to coding.  Even if the manager designed and drew the schemes to you.  Sketch your own interpretation of the problem.  This will clarify unclear points and save you a lot of time. </li><li>  Try to prioritize yourself. </li><li>  Design yourself and do not expect the manager or team leader to fully manage and adjust the steps.  They have no time for this. </li></ol><br><br>  <b>References:</b> <br><ul><li>  <a href="http://www.ozon.ru/context/detail/id/4749424/">Stephen R.
