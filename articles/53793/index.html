      It is not the first time that I write about the products of this wonderful Swiss company - yet, when companies do not disperse into many areas, in some small field of activity, it achieves excellent results.  Today, the <b>Logitech MX 5500 Revolution</b> wireless kit appeared on my desk.  I hasten to share my impressions of work! <br><br>  The full name of the product - <b>Logitech Cordless Desktop MX 5500 Revolution</b> - now on the <a href="http://www.logitech.com/index.cfm/keyboards/keyboard_mice_combos/%26cl%3Dru,ru">site</a> it is the last among the kits. <br><br>  So, as usual, it all starts with the box.  It is large and very informative in content: <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/2.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In general, there are two :) One in the other.  In this stylish black box, you can store black caviar in a black closet for a rainy day: <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/3.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h3>  EQUIPMENT </h3><br>  Inside the boxes are: <br>  - Keyboard <b>Logitech MX 5500</b> ; <br>  - Mouse <b>Logitech MX Revolution</b> ; <br>  - Miniature Bluetooth USB receiver; <br>  - Cradle to charge the mouse; <br>  - Four AA batteries for the keyboard; <br>  - Disk with drivers and other information; <br>  - Quick start guide. <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/4.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/5.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/5_2.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  I'll start in reverse order. <br><br>  The last two items are folded in one envelope.  The operation manual in several languages, including in Russian.  Despite the fact that everything is clear from small drawings, I advise you to read the text - now I always do it - many questions disappear, sometimes interesting features of the work are found out.  The disc contains <b>SetPoint 4.24</b> software, although version <b>4.7</b> is now available on the site - do not forget to upgrade!  And also read the text paragraph below. <br><br>  <b>Batteries</b>  It's nice that this is not a noname-battery for the mind, but the most real Dyuraselly!  :) There are 4 of them and they will provide keyboard power for a long time - I worked for a month and I am sure that this is not the limit.  In order not to recall the power of the keyboard at all, the batteries can be replaced with high-capacity batteries. <br><br>  Charging for the mouse.  Made as follows - a plastic cradle, from the back of which a wire goes to the outlet through the adapter.  The mouse lays down on it in the only way. <br>  I will note a small nuance that I would hardly have noticed in any other review :) The fact is that I have had exactly the same mouse for two years now and the wire of its cradle is disconnected.  This is convenient because the wire can be unplugged and inserted into another cradle (for my keyboard) - they have the same connectors.  Thus, I got rid of one extra wire (which I already have a lot of).  In the case of a cradle from this kit, there is no such happiness ... in fact, as there is no second wire - the keyboard does not charge in the dock, but is powered by batteries :) Otherwise, everything is exactly the same.  So, just noticed. <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/6.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Bluetooth USB receiver</b> .  It is a device the size of a flash drive, made of translucent black plastic.  On one side of the ‚Äúflash drive‚Äù is a ‚Äúred button‚Äù - yes, that one.  I didn't have to use it - after I inserted the receiver into the USB port, the mouse and keyboard immediately showed up without any problems.  If you do not want to squeeze all the juices from the kit, even the driver does not have to be installed - everything works without them.  Stable at a distance of 6 meters (with reinforced concrete floors) - at what maximum distance the kit works, I do not know.  What is nice is that with the help of a keychain via Bluetooth you can connect other devices - a phone, a PDA.  I was surprised that 5 devices worked simultaneously in the same range without problems for each other - 2 mice, 2 keyboards and a communicator. <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/7.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/8.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Mouse Logitech MX Revolution</b> .  I have already done a very detailed review of this wonderful mouse ( <a href="http://www.amdclub.ru/content/view/6677/1/">once</a> and <a href="http://aboutall.nnm.ru/obzor_myshki_logitech_mx_revolution_i_klavy_dinovo_edge">twice</a> ). <br>  But I can still add something, again from the nuances.  I bought my mouse almost the first day, as it went on sale - which is strange, somewhat cheaper than it is now.  Comparing it and the mouse from the kit: <br>  - They have a barely excellent body color, but both surfaces are pleasant to the eye and touch. <br>  - The mouse from the kit has a quick search button that is tunable, not chrome-plated, but black, next to it a Bluetooth icon is printed, which I don‚Äôt have.  My side wheel is metallic, here, it seems, plastic on top.  But this did not affect the work - absolutely everything is exactly the same.  By the way, the delusion of many - under the thumb is NOT SCROLL, and the joystick in the form of a wheel (back and forth + pressing). <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/9_2.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/9_3.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/9_4.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/10.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/10_2.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  And one more difference - if you turn the mice up belly.  There is a red <b>Connect</b> button on the tested mouse, which I don‚Äôt have.  I don‚Äôt understand why they did it - maybe in some cases someone‚Äôs connection disappears, I haven‚Äôt ever had this happen.  For a few years.  Fair. <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/11.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/12.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The optical sensor is, in fact, 800dpi, not 1600, as many sources say: (But for all the time I have never experienced any inconvenience - I have enough positioning accuracy (although sometimes there is pixel-by-pixel work in Photoshop). <br>  The battery in the mouse is built-in at 600mAh and theoretically not replaceable, but as I wrote, it fits from the <b>Logitech G7</b> mouse.  The time of the mouse depends on the intensity of use, for me it is from 3 to 7 days.  On the mouse there is a charge indicator, more precisely, the time of work can always be viewed in the tray if you install the driver. <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/13.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Drivers are installed without problems.  Weigh about 50 MB - I think we should not consider this a minus (in the next article about the universal remote, I will tell you why).  After installing the standard drivers, I advise you to put the add-in - <br>  <b><a href="http://www.mstar.net/users/rlowens/">UberOptions</a></b> - it will significantly expand the capabilities of standard software. <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/14.png" alt="image"><br><br>  If you decide to spend some time on a convenient and practical keyboard setup, you may encounter the problem of assigning to the buttons such combinations as ‚ÄúALT + F4‚Äù, ‚ÄúCTRL + W‚Äù and so on.  How to solve it - see <a href="http://www.mstar.net/users/rlowens/%3Fn%3DSetPoint.StuckModifiers">here</a> .  Incidentally, I wrote in the magazine ‚Äú <b>Iron</b> ‚Äù (# 046 issue) an article about the fine tuning of the MX Revolution mouse - an article without pictures <a href="http://www.xard.ru/post/12541/default.asp">is available</a> on the Internet. <br><br>  And the last.  Very important.  I met people on the net who ‚Äúinstantly slabs paint-logos, buttons are wiped‚Äù and anything else, just to throw an expensive mouse into the garden.  Believe should not be - these guys are not buying Logitech, but something similar to a pair of Abibos and Adidas :) No matter how many Logitech mice and keyboards I have, nothing has been erased and rubbed off.  Mostly scratched, but no one is insured by more than one manufacturer of equipment. <br><br>  So, so quietly, I sneaked up to the most important thing that I wanted to tell about in this article - to the keyboard. <br><br><h3>  Keyboard Logitech MX 5500 </h3> . <br>  As I understand it, it is not sold separately. <br><br>  I take it out of the box - the keyboard is of a somewhat unusual shape, light.  Matt black.  I twist-twirl - as always - a very good build, no gaps, gaps and burrs.  On the back of the keyboard is a compartment, where the batteries are inserted, going in the kit.  Two legs - can slightly increase the angle of inclination.  There are several rubber inserts, but despite their presence, the keyboard is easy to budge. <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/15.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/16.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  On the other hand, all the fun.  Below is a rubberized non-removable palm rest - this is used in many Logitech products.  The pleasant sensations from touching can be diminished if you work with dirty hands - it is enough to just ‚Äúclog‚Äù the ‚Äúpoints‚Äù on the rubber insert. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.logitech.com/index.cfm/keyboards/keyboard_mice_combos/devices/3481%26cl%3Dru,ru">3D image</a> . <br><br>  The keyboard layout is familiar enough, albeit with nuances - 119 buttons, 15 of which are additional. <br><br>  On the left, there are two zoom buttons (+ and -), under which there is a Flip 3D button for Vista.  3D-scrolling, something similar to Alt + Tab is the same function that is assigned by default to the mouse joystick under the thumb.  Just to the right, there are 6 buttons to control the music player: Play / Pause, Next, Prev, Vol +, Vol- and Mute.  If it is still convenient to use the first three, then these 6 buttons, due to the fact that they almost do not protrude from the relief, I had almost no attention.  However, they work :) <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/17.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The F1-F12 buttons are located on the top row, on which functions painted by pressing the Fn key are marked with orange paint.  I think that this was done in vain - not everyone will want to leave Word, Excel and so on.  F9-F12 are marked as A, B, C and D - you can hang anything on them in the settings as well. <br>  To the right is the Insert button.  That's what I don't like ... when they make a big Del, sacrificing the insert button.  At the top, it seems to me, it does not belong, but for some reason almost all manufacturers took it as a standard. <br>  More to the right is the calculator button, and instead of the NumLock on the numeric keypad, the button for resetting the calculator.  But about him a little further. <br>  The right button decided to become the PC button - it puts the computer into sleep mode. <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/18.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Three more buttons, which I did not talk about, are located in a very unusual place - under the numeric keypad.  They also practically do not stick out, so they do not accidentally click - they are designed to start the music player, open the folder with photos and open the widget panel in Vista. <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/19.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Typing on the keyboard is very convenient, hands almost never get tired.  The key travel is small, the pressings are quiet, but louder than on diNovo Edge;) <br><br><h3>  LCD Display </h3><br>  At the top of the noticeably protruding plastic part there is a black and white (more precisely, black and gray) display, on which various information can be displayed.  Below it are two buttons ("and") that can switch the functionality of the screen: <br><br>  1. Launch control panel, search, my documents, etc.  - those functions that are assigned to AD; <br>  2. Ambient temperature; <br>  3. Information from the player; <br>  4. Keystroke counter; <br>  5. Calculator; <br>  6. Notification of new messages; <br>  7. Time and date. <br><br>  All this is configured in the <b>SetPoint</b> program from the kit.  Item 1 - fully reassigned.  The default temperature is displayed in Fahrenheit, but it can be shown in the usual degrees Celsius (it would seem, who needs this temperature? For example, someone who has a baby in a room [like me] or at least an air conditioner). <br>  Information from the player was displayed immediately - I had Winamp 5.5, but it works with other programs.  There are no problems with Cyrillic.  The keystroke counter is a very useful function, but there is not much practical use of it, IMHO.  I don‚Äôt know if the size of the key counter will decrease after a million clicks or will it stop its work at 999.999?  I remember one quote - ‚ÄúYou are the one who should marry me because of the size of the history in ICQ‚Äù :) <br>  Notifications about new messages work with Outlook, but I am not used to using them. <br>  Time and date - everything is short and clear. <br>  The function of the calculator was very popular not only for me, but also for my wife - she sometimes has to calculate something for work, and she has already got used to typing on the numeric keypad. <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/20.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  If you wish, you can invert the colors of the display - I personally liked the white text on a black background more.  If the content on the screen was visible in the dark - it would be just great, but then it would have a significant impact on the operating time of the device.  Everywhere their compromises. <br><br><h3>  Software </h3><br>  As I have already said, a driver disk was included with the package - <b>SetPoint 4.24</b> .  I, of course, did not install it - a newer version was already in my system.  And with it, the <b>UberOptions</b> add- <b>on</b> , which I wrote about above.  Therefore, I can not say exactly which settings are available initially.  But I can safely say - now you can customize almost anything. <br><br>  Just give a few images: <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/21.png" alt="image"><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/22.png" alt="image"><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/23.png" alt="image"><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/24.png" alt="image"><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/25.png" alt="image"><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/26.png" alt="image"><br><br>  What I liked again was that the program works correctly with several devices at once.  What does it mean?  And the fact that not everyone has several keyboards and mice, but even so, the Logitech programmers debugged work with several devices, thereby ensuring that I would write this article :) Once again, I am pleased with their software. <br><br><h3>  Minuses </h3><br>  - Mouse only for right-handers; <br>  - The mouse is more suitable for office use, although for ALL my needs it is more than enough (I do not play, and in the graphics I use a tablet more often); <br>  - Batteries in the keyboard with a single charge (like a mouse) would be more practical; <br>  - Keyboard screen without backlight (minus it?); <br>  - A high price (Minus? While the buck flies somewhere in the clouds - yes. If everything is namralized, then the kit will be much more accessible. Or have you noticed a jump in prices of almost all the equipment?) <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/27.png" alt="image"><br><br><h3>  pros </h3><br>  - Excellent ergonomics of both devices; <br>  - Excellent build quality, appearance; <br>  - A huge functionality for setting up devices; <br>  - Excellent software; <br>  - Bluetooth communication. <br><br><h3>  TOTAL </h3><br>  Total, as I expected, turned out to be an excellent kit from a manufacturer who knows his stuff.  This is not innovation for 44,000 rubles <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/gadgets/48543/">to do</a> :) <br><br>  The kit will suit a very wide audience of users - from novice users who are just learning to type using the ten-finger method to those who, like a spider with a lot of paws, crawl on the keyboard, blindly pressing one combination of hot keys after another.  For those who are accustomed to style and comfortable work - the kit is also suitable. <br>  The price, like many other types of devices, has now grown, but it is still at an acceptable level.  Having spent once, you will quickly get used to a new occupant of the working space and, like me, you will hardly want to switch to something else.  Once again, I advise. <br><br>  In the near future I plan to somewhat improve the quality of articles, in particular, get rid of smiles and improve the quality of photos.  An overview of what you would like to read next time?  I will try :) <br><br>  <b><a href="http://boomburum.ru/">Successes!</a></b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/53793/">https://habr.com/ru/post/53793/</a></p>
