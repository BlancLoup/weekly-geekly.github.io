Accidents happen to happen for quite funny reasons.  For example, <abbr title="Fiber-optic communication lines, optical fiber">FOCL was</abbr> cut by local residents for making a fire, rats crawled into <abbr title="Broadband Access - Home Internet">broadband</abbr> nodes.  ShTA cabinet cover 3 residents used a barbecue in the yard.  A cheerful grandmother from the Volga region was afraid of radiation and cut all the wires she saw. <br><br>  Here, for example, <b>Sochi</b> .  Already two New Years, the same man, firing a gun, falls into our fiber optic line.  Apparently, on the feast of his overwhelmed with emotions.  It is necessary for the GRRS brigade to leave and eliminate (the blessing is that there is no ring and no service break).  This year we were waiting for him, but he did not shoot.

      Or now <b>Krasnoyarsk</b> .  Monitoring shows a twisted pair break.  At the site, the guard sees a person leaving the building with a bag of cable.  Grabs his hand.  Vandal perplexed: ‚ÄúWhat are you?  Do you need a cable?  Go and cut yourself! ‚Äù <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>In general, we are constantly suffering from metal collectors</b> .  This summer, a lid was stolen from one of the main wells.  And under it lies the fiber optic ring from Moscow to Sochi.  A couple of days later the dog fell there.  I couldn't get out, I sat there until I was starving, and I gnawed on the cable from hunger.  The whole direction fell at 9 o'clock: first, the Emergencies Ministry rescued the dog, then our engineers did the insertion. <br><br>  Communication breakage in a large area of ‚Äã‚ÄãKrasnoyarsk.  As usual - the construction site, we begin to look for an excavator.  But no, everything is much more interesting.  The builders decided to improve their habitat with a toilet.  Deep occurrence.  And, correctly, drilled exactly into the telephone sewer.  The failed bathroom cost them about 600 thousand rubles - while a small one-room apartment in this city. <br><br>  <b>Many people even behave like children in adult life</b> .  Once there was an abnormal disconnection of the incoming channel to Rostov.  The explanation of the engineer-culprit (not ours) is ingenious: "I have never seen such a connector, well, I pulled it out to look."  In the same place in Rostov-on-Don there was a second unusual case.  The guard at one of the objects for the New Year decided to protect themselves from fire.  And systematically cut down all the unimportant electrical appliances, which he found.  Among other things, he found a suspicious "household appliance" - a broadband node.  Also cut down, albeit with difficulty.  Persistent turned man. <br><br>  <b>With the owners,</b> too many stories.  The connection with one radio relay station, which was located on an office building, somehow disappeared.  When we reached the local responsible people, we heard something like the following: ‚ÄúA raider seizure of the building took place, and now it is de-energized.  Proceedings are being conducted between owners and tenants, but both sides against Beeline have nothing and hope that they will soon resume the work of the equipment. ‚Äù  Or here once we couldn‚Äôt get to the object with artists for almost a month, as it was unreal to find them on the spot. <br><br>  I think every tech support has a bunch of tales.  Our favorite is this: the broadband subscriber complained that as soon as the wife went to sleep, the Internet was disconnected.  It seems to be happy family happiness, but no, caused the technique.  It turned out that the apartment was a rearrangement of furniture.  The cable as a result of these movements was let straight on the floor, and put the bed on it.  Bed without a wife - the cable works fine.  With his wife - closes.  Women, take note, it can save someone's marriage :) <br><br>  <b>Well, I think the most famous story in our environment is about psychology.</b>  Often tenants have access to electrical panels through which our equipment is powered.  Not all tenants are technically savvy, and therefore automatic machines are sometimes turned off by hand.  The most frequent complaint, of course, is the ‚Äúnegative field‚Äù of equipment.  In one of the houses, the situation began to repeat once a week.  Usually like: technicians come, turn, leave.  And here is the detail - every time an elderly man approached them, started talking on different topics.  The same.  Politely asked about the shield, but he said he did not touch anything.  After 5-6 cases, the technicians from conversations found out that he is without relatives, and he has no friends in the city.  And once they asked if he needed a kitten.  The kitten, by the way, was found in the collector during repair work, and lived on the basis of technicians.  So, the man agreed, and the animal moved to him.  After that, no disabling of the machine occurred. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/210044/">https://habr.com/ru/post/210044/</a></p>
