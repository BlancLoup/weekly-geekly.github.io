    <h5>  Why do I need to read this? </h5><br>  If you do not like pollutants - no need.  Otherwise, you may see new storylines in a familiar story.  Perhaps, like me, you will be more interested in watching a movie, or maybe you all noticed it, but you had no one to talk about. <br><br><h5>  Is that fan fiction? </h5><br>  No, I do not invent a story, just interpret and guess.  Such theories can be found on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/">reddit</a> .  I used some of them to fill in the gaps where I didn‚Äôt think of it myself. <br><br><h5>  Spoilers? </h5><br>  Yes, without them - in any way, but only from the original and new trilogy, the game Force Unleashed and a little from the animated series "Clone Wars" and "Rebels".  The seventh episode, as though I would not like this, I will not include it, not all have looked. <br><br><h5>  Expanded Universe? </h5><br>  Unfortunately, after the release of the seventh part, the expanded universe is no longer considered a canon.  Now it‚Äôs just a collection of legends, perhaps truthful, rather not.  But, since some information has not yet been refuted by the new expanded universe, we can take this for at least some source of information. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  Some tediousness </h5><br>  It seems to me that the attribution of pollutants to science fiction is fundamentally wrong.  We know nothing about the laws of physics in a ‚Äúdistant galaxy far‚Äù, and everything that we have seen shows that they are very different from ours.  Therefore, films like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_of_Star_Wars_(miniseries)">‚ÄúStar Wars Science‚Äù are</a> interesting from the point of view of popularization of science, but not the refutation of physics in the universe of pollutants.  By and large, we can not even be sure that the space of pollutants has a similar density with ours, and that the sound in it does not spread. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Easter eggs</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Once, during a dispute on this topic, I was pointed out that, in the pollutant, we mean at least our universe, because we see the ET delegation in the ‚Äúhidden threat‚Äù, and in ET itself seeing Yoda, the alien screamed ‚Äúhome, house! A bad argument, but a good easter egg. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/eec/28d/d8b/eec28dd8b09d4c0b91a947368e6df279.jpg"><br></div></div><br>  Among other things, the basis of everything in the world of pollutants is Strength: a <a href="http://ru.starwars.wikia.com/wiki/%25D0%25A1%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0">rational deity</a> (or at least very close to that), with the aim of maintaining balance in the Universe at any cost.  In the plot of the film a lot of ridiculous coincidences (especially in the new trilogy), thanks to which the plot moves.  And, although, in the script art, ‚Äúthe piano in the bushes‚Äù is a lowbrow reception, speaking of the laziness of the writers, in the case of ZV - the whole idea is based on this piano.  Here it is either to accept or not.  Force can lead heroes anywhere and save them from death if this is consistent with its goals. <br><br>  Actually, theories themselves. <br><br><h5>  Theory: The Empire Made Scapegoats From Droids </h5><br>  What do you remember from the new trilogy?  Beautiful cities, political squabbles, Magister Yoda with a lightsaber, a bunch of holograms and ... droids, many droids. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5d2/aeb/77e/5d2aeb77eea442a0b94dd8bb3840d928.jpg"><br><br>  In the "New Hope" and, in general, in the original trilogy, droids are also present, but they are much smaller.  At the same time, these are mainly droids that were made in the Republic.  Not to mention the fact that they look like scrap metal (not counting the imperial ones, of course) <br><br>  The question is why the civilization, in which the question of artificial intelligence is resolved and where droids occupy a central place in life, suddenly ceased to use them. <br><br>  From the animated series "Rebels" and the games "Force Unleashed" we can understand that the transformation of the republic into an empire was not so smooth.  And yet, at the beginning of episode 4, we learn that Darth Sidious dissolved parliament (this took him 19 years), this is the last reminder of the Republic. <br><br>  Initially, Palpatine became Supreme Chancellor because of the threat of the Sith and a confederation of independent systems.  When he came to power, he resolved these issues, on the one hand, taking control of the Trade Federation (the main sponsor of the separatists), on the other - declaring all rumors about the Sith plot against the Republic, and the Jedi - traitors.  But, despite the fact that the crisis was (formally) resolved, Palpatine‚Äôs power intensified over the next 19 years so that he could dissolve the Senate without consequences.  It can be assumed that he used the well-known "external enemy" to intimidate the galaxy and strengthen its position.  My version: he used droids.  At that time, the rebels did not exist yet and over the following years they offered sluggish resistance.  Their positions were strengthened already closer to the events of New Hope, when droids in the galaxy remained only as a necessary measure. <br><br>  Why not Jedi? <br><br>  Most of them were destroyed by order 66;  those who remained could be chosen as terrorists, but it can be assumed that the emperor went another way.  At the beginning of ‚ÄúNew Hope‚Äù, Admiral Motti impudently declares that the doctrine of power is an outdated religion.  Han Solo also states Obi Wan that having flown around the galaxy he did not meet evidence of the existence of a force, although in age he had to catch the events of the Clone Wars.  Chui also helped Yoda escape from Kashik and could tell Han about this. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/297/8fd/8ae/2978fd8aefc14b7a934d9202e39214f3.jpg"><br><br>  It seems to me that the empire denied the existence of the Jedi and power, declaring them to be magicians and charlatans.  Nineteen years is not enough for people to forget the events that they witnessed, but with massive propaganda (and also considering the great rarity of the Jedi) most of them could be convinced that they didn‚Äôt see what they thought, but the Jedi are like sorcerers we have: smart, skilled magicians (who kidnap children and teach them to play with the lightsaber). <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">offtop about Hannah who shot first</b> <div class="spoiler_text"> Not the most popular topic for holivar with us.  All information can be found at the request of ‚ÄúHan shot first‚Äù, but here I‚Äôll just briefly describe it.  In Cantina on Tatooine there is a cult scene where Khan kills Grido for extortion.  Initially, Khan was the first to shoot, but many fans were looking for signs in the haze that Khan was defending.  Later, Lucas ordered to add a shot to the scene Grido, which caused outrage of those fans who liked the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcold-blooded Han Solo.  In the end, in the last re-release the scene was re-edited so that it seems that both shoot simultaneously. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/xxODU7RK730%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgxkfnNoFyeDM1kJQRtQiToBK2Quw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Which version is correct - the dispute does not subside (although, Khan shot first). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f45/36f/967/f4536f967525418c861abf49eabd4ccb.png"><br></div></div><br>  Suppose that Palpatine chose a new ‚Äúexternal threat‚Äù for government propaganda.  For example - droids.  It is quite clear that people are easily led to this.  Droids caused a lot of trouble during the Clone wars.  They ravaged the planet for the planet, often used for espionage and murder.  In "New Hope" in the cantina the owner refuses to service the droids.  His reaction seems a bit exaggerated.  How could non-drinking peace droids interfere with the work of the bar where the murderers and smugglers gathered?  Perhaps people were afraid of droids and considered them a threat in any form. <br><br>  For the cultivation of hatred of droids was another reason.  The empire, like any militarized dictatorship, had to increase production at a rapid pace to preserve stability.  Wide employment and a focus on the military industry would help keep people under control.  At the same time, the widespread use of droids in industry left no room for manual labor.  On the one hand, the purchasing power of the population fell, which threatened to collapse the economy, on the other hand, low employment and the benefits of ‚Äúfree labor machines‚Äù would lead to the fact that most of the population would have too much free time.  As a result, dissatisfaction with the regime would grow and there would be an opportunity to create an organized resistance. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">If you still do not mind the droids</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  In the Return of the Jedi, there is a scene where a droid is being tortured into Hatt‚Äôs shelter. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/7CR8fmF0gt8%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhg9EMXoqwAKw8ABLhqCZtlIL2KLxQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  The question arises, why should someone program the droid for the presence of pain.  And even so, why make him scream.  Explanation: The widespread hatred of droids could make such an "upgrade" quite popular, because, tormenting the enemy, you need to understand that it hurts. <br></div></div><br><h5>  Theory: Empire is not the best economic model. </h5><br>  Not quite a complete theory, rather an observation. <br><br>  In addition to the lack of droids, after the transition from the ‚ÄúRevenge of the Sith‚Äù to the ‚ÄúNew Hope‚Äù, the obvious technological lag behind the Empire is striking.  Virtually nothing that the clone army used was preserved in the empire.  This technique may have been destroyed by the rebels in recent years before the ‚ÄúNew Hope‚Äù, but why then all the new production of the Empire so far behind. <br><br>  On the one hand, the reason may be in the exclusion of droids from production.  Without workers 24/7 slaves, for a quick build-up of military power, simpler designs were required.  It can also be assumed that the technology in the Republic was produced on the basis of a competitive market, while the Empire could not afford to loosen its grip.  Most likely, all the main production was ‚Äúnationalized‚Äù, which could not but affect the quality of products. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">We know examples</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  I do not want to draw parallels, but you can compare it with the USSR before the pre-NEP times, when the main ideology was ‚Äúmilitary communism‚Äù.  At the same time, many enterprises were nationalized, including the first energy company, previously owned by <a href="http://www.mosenergo.ru/catalog/226.aspx">the Siemens brothers</a> .  I do not give any assessment, just notice that the NEP was a necessity due to similar problems. <br></div></div><br>  Obviously, in the galactic empire - the concept of private property is not in value.  In ‚ÄúThe Empire Strikes Back,‚Äù Lando Calrisian says that their colony does not fall under the jurisdiction of the Empire, because it is too small.  But still, they lived in constant fear until they made a deal with the Empire (the conditions of which Vader easily violated). <br><br>  In total, the entire private sector plows to the Empire, while the Empire itself is mainly engaged in the military industry.  For example, the construction of the Death Star took about 20 years, which is pretty good, given the scale of production and the level of secrecy.  Moreover, it is hard to believe that the second death star was built within such a short time after the destruction of the first.  It can be assumed that the construction proceeded in parallel. <br><br>  For comparison, you can look at the project of the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B2%25D1%2583%25D1%2587%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D1%258D%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F">Floating Nuclear Power Plant</a> , construction, which took about 10 years. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">About the fatal vulnerability of the Death Star</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  By the way, that same heat sink mine on the Death Star is not such a vulnerability.  There were a lot of jokes on this topic, from Robotsyp to <a href="http://ria.ru/world/20130112/917828858.html">the US government</a> , but let's look at the facts: <br><br>  1) The Death Star is perhaps one of the most energetic autonomous stations in the universe.  It is terrible to think about how much heat she produced while working at full power.  Heat sink was needed. <br><br>  2) The mine was as narrow as possible, and guarded by heavy Turrets. <br><br>  3) The rebels used <a href="http://ru.starwars.wikia.com/wiki/%25D0%259A%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D1%2581%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D1%258D%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B4%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D1%258F_(%25D0%2590%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D1%258F%25D0%25BD%25D1%2581_%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D1%2586%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B2)">the Red Squadron</a> to attack.  Elite fighter link, which was almost completely destroyed during the attack. <br><br>  4) None of the pilots of the red squadron could fulfill the mission, even a direct hit, according to computer calculations, could not provide the necessary conditions for a chain reaction in the core. <br><br>  5) The only one who was able to cope with the task was Luke, who concurrently used the Force (read magic), was the best pilot in the galaxy and who was assisted by his dead teacher in the form of a ghost. <br><br>  In a sense, it is unlikely that risk planning during construction could take such a turn into account.  In the end, the rest of the Imperial technique is vulnerable to direct hits from the large fleet. <br></div></div><br><h5>  Theory: Darth Vader is not such a villain, rather a coward </h5><br>  There will have to go from afar.  In addition, this theory is based on another <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/4290d0/star_wars_darth_vader_was_a_zombie/">fan idea</a> , that Anakin died in Sith revenge. <br><br>  So, in order.  At the end of the third episode, we see the breathtaking contract of Anakin and Obi Wan, which lasts about 8 minutes of screen time. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/pSwy412nttI&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgKgWeWcnUy7WFpXC12JoLY4EgpKQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  This is one of the longest bouts in the history of cinema.  Changing locations, the use of force, choking techniques, various Jedi techniques, senseless sword rotation (1:40) and the wonders of choreography.  To many, this fight seemed, to put it mildly, unrealistic.  Especially considering the fact that after 20 years the battle of Darth Vader and Ben Kenobi looks like this: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/8kpHK4YIwY4%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhiCN8SYSvnd7yzhnQdL6BoRGIRz9A" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Suppose the battle in the third episode has an explanation.  Anakin and Obi-Wan fought shoulder to shoulder for many years.  Surely sparring was common for them, everyone knew what the other would do, and that is why their movements were so synchronized.  But why after 20 years of revenge Vader so sluggish? <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">I stand taller than you</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  At the end of the fight, Obi-Wan stands on a dais, and Anakin stands on a platform in the lava river.  ‚ÄúIt's all over, Anakin, I'm taller than you,‚Äù Obi-Wan says, and adds that you should not even try. <br><br>  Considering that Obi-Wan himself defeated Darth-Mola, being below, this, at least, is a strange statement.  It can be assumed that Anakin knew perfectly well how exactly his teacher won in that battle.  Perhaps Obi-Wan tells him just that he himself is an expert in such a reception and Anakin will not be able to catch him unawares, to which Anakin replies: "You underestimate my strength."  As it turned out - it is not. <br></div></div><br>  According to one of the fan theories, Anakin died at the end of the third episode and was resurrected by the Emperor.  One version of this theory suggests that for resurrection, the Emperor drained the life force from Padme.  In confirmation of this, the final scene of the Return of the Jedi is shown after the re-release, where instead of Darth Vader we see young Anakin, although Obi-Wan looks exactly the same as before his death: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/940/00d/e56/94000de562c34fdcb5b58172fe1c31af.jpg"><br><br>  Among other things, it fits in with a general reference to Christianity: ‚ÄúAnakin was conceived immaculately, traveled the world, he had students, he was betrayed by a friend, and was resurrected after his death). <br><br>  My version - the Emperor not only resurrected Darth Vader, but also kept him alive.  That is why Vader did not dare to speak out against the Emperor, but did everything that anyone would do it for him. <br><br>  In Force Unleashed, we saw Vader, with the help of a secret apprentice, raise the rise against Palpatine from almost nothing.  At the same time, Vader did not take the opportunity to betray the emperor, but he did not kill Glen Marek either.  If we assume that all this was in the plans of Darth Vader, then all resistance appeared only thanks to him. <br><br>  Next in the ‚ÄúNew Hope‚Äù we see the clash between Obi-Wan and Darth Vader.  Obi-Wan had aged, he had not practiced fencing for decades, but Darth Vader had more practice, and yet, in their battle, it is clear that Vader is not very keen to kill the former teacher.  Perhaps he specifically pulled time, or tried to grab Obi-Wan alive. <br><br>  If you look at their fight carefully, you can see that they are like crossing swords in the beginning for formality.  Toward the end, it looks more like a fight, but only with the filing of Obi-Wan, Vader is more likely to defend himself.  It is noteworthy that later he shows himself as a more active swordsman. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">And more about the fight</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  I have no evidence, but I always view this fight in this vein: Obi-Darth Vader taught the basics of owning a lightsaber.  Perhaps the style in which the battle is fought (in fact, this is Kendo, of course) is the basic style for all students.  Obi-Wan, imposing this particular style of battle on Vader, seems to be trying to evoke the necessary feelings in him.  Vader plays to the former teacher.  Thus, he does not fall under suspicion of Sidious, but at the same time leads a silent conversation with Obi-Wan. <br></div></div><br>  When Luke runs up to the battlefield, Obi-Wan looks at him, and then, smiling, at Vader.  Vader realizes that Luke is his chance, he also understands what Obi-Wan's plan is and, when the latter is preparing to unite with force, Vader kills him, although at that moment there was no need (he removed the sword). <br><br>  In general, during the film, Vader is not so keen to kill.  Here, for example, a selection of all his murders, for the most part - the pilots of the red squadron: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/JZtqh5FK1yc%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhideCZZ8ud_x5utMVVDCN-PFckVaQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">about a capsule with no signs of life</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  At the beginning of the ‚ÄúNew Hope‚Äù, the Imperials do not destroy the rescue capsule, in effect giving way to the plot.  This is a great story about the oppression of droids.  By that time, most of the ‚Äúintelligent‚Äù droids were destroyed, so the Imperials who were confident of their superiority could not imagine that some droids could cause them trouble. <br></div></div><br>  In ‚ÄúThe Empire Strikes Back,‚Äù at the moment when Han Solo prepares to freeze, Chewbacca breaks free and begins to scatter attack aircraft.  Boba Fett aims at Chewbacca, but Vader doesn‚Äôt give him a shot.  Quite a strange act, it is clear why he needs Leya, but there was no point in keeping Chewbacca alive. <br><br>  In fact, Vader leads Luke to the Emperor by any means, simultaneously preparing him for this meeting.  In the finale of the Return of the Jedi, Vader hesitates not because the light and dark side fights in him, but because he knows that with the death of the Emperor, he himself will die.  Perhaps that is why he did not let Luke kill Sidious by stopping his lightsaber, and Sidious, who already doubted Vader, was calm and knew that Vader would protect him.  Also in Force Unleashed, we saw that Vader's armor could endure more than just a lightning strike, but still, after the Emperor's death, he says that he cannot be saved. <br><br>  Another drawn confirmation of the "grace" Vader.  In the "New Hope" - attack aircraft "smear".  They are so obviously shooting off target, that the phrase stormtroopers aim has become a common noun.  Perhaps they were instructed not to kill, because earlier Obi-Wan, examining the corpses of Jaw, said that attack aircraft are excellent arrows.  Also, later on ‚ÄûHote‚Äú, they easily suppress the defense of the resistance. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Although probably not</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  In fact, it does not seem to me that the attack aircraft missed on purpose.  In my opinion, there is another explanation.  Perhaps, blasters are far from the best weapon in terms of accuracy, but its use is due to its versatility.  Army in the universe of pollutants operate on different planets, with different gravity and atmosphere.  The use of bullets could often be impossible.  If we add to this the fact that the Empire coped with production worse than the Republic, one can understand why attack aircraft shoot much worse than the clones.  However, in certain conditions, when they deal with familiar conditions (Tatooine, Hot), they can shoot much better.
