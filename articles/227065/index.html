      <br>
      In anticipation of the release of the model on the Russian market, we decided to talk about the features of the new smartphone and share with you some excerpts from an interview with Jonne Harju, who was responsible for the design of the new flagship smartphone and other new products of the company. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  "Iron" </h4><br>  As we mentioned above, the heart of the flagship smartphone has become a quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 processor with a clock frequency of 2.2 GHz.  The Adreno 330 graphics core, two gigabytes of LPDDR3 RAM, and an internal storage capacity of 32 GB speak of competitive advantages.  Support for memory cards in the smartphone is not provided, however, as in all other Lumia, there are 7 free gigabytes in the OneDrive storage. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/044/c81/f76/044c81f767c49a5a20f9b29c3d806016.jpg"><br><br>  The smartphone supports all modern communication standards, including LTE networks, Wi-Fi WLAN IEEE 802.11 a / b / g / n / ac (which is prudent), Bluetooth 4.0 and NFC. <br><br>  Despite the fact that, in general, the specifications are identical to the larger screen Lumia 1520 smartphone (with the exception of the memory card and the screen itself), ideally the Nokia Lumia 930 is the successor to the Lumia 920/925 line of models. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/280/145/fce/280145fce4a6e9057dfa12481fdfdb20.jpg"><br><br>  The smartphone is equipped with a 5-inch OLED display.  Its resolution is 1920 x 1080 pixels with a pixel density of 441 pixels / inch.  Traditionally, the screen has <a href="http://conversations.nokia.ru/2011/11/ekran-clearblack-na-nokia-lumia-chernee-chernogo">ClearBlack technology</a> and is highly sensitive, allowing you to control your smartphone even with gloves on.  It is also worth noting that the screen covers the third generation of Gorilla Glass. <br><br>  The status of the best camera phone still holds the Nokia Lumia 1020 with a 41 megapixel camera, but the new flagship is not far behind in performance.  The 20 megapixel camera with PureView technology features a large 1 / 2.5 inch sensor and a flash with two LEDs.  Optics as well as in many other Lumia models are made by our friends from ZEISS. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8ca/f8a/0e2/8caf8a0e2554e66ddb22e57124a95073.jpg"><br><br>  Special attention should be paid to the technology of Rich Recording.  To enable users to record better, more realistic sound, Nokia installed four high-performance omnidirectional microphones in the Nokia Lumia 930.  Two on the front and two on the back. <br><br>  By using digital signal processing and thoughtful positioning of elements, four omnidirectional microphones can be combined and operate as two directional microphones. <br><br>  When stereo recording is directed, the sound in front of the camera is captured and noises from different sides are ignored.  This way you can achieve greater clarity. <br><br>  To get an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhat kind of sound can be recorded using Nokia Rich Recording, you can watch the video recorded on the camera carrier Nokia Lumia Icon (a variant of Nokia Lumia 930 for the US market), which uses the same technology. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/EOSzGfS6qjU%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700019,15700043,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256&amp;usg=ALkJrhjLhRkM2k1BHMmHK6kzIuDEERuS1g" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Touching on the topic of power consumption, it is worth noting that the Nokia Lumia 930 is equipped with a 2420 mAh battery.  Its charge can be replenished, including through wireless charging standard Qi.  A fully charged device can work up to 16 hours in talk mode and up to 9 hours in video mode. <br><br><h4>  Windows 8.1 and corporate services </h4><br>  Nokia Lumia 930 is the second smartphone (after Nokia Lumia 630) on the Russian market, working on the updated version of Windows Phone 8.1. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c76/643/ee7/c76643ee7f7c28d23502ce1eecda00d5.jpg"><br><br>  Since the topic of this update has been repeatedly raised at Habrahabr, we will only briefly list the main innovations: <br><br>  - Voice Assistant Cortana (so far in the beta version for the US market, but with time and on the rest); <br>  - Notification Center + quick access to settings from the drop-down menu at the top of the screen; <br>  - Improved interface (the ability to choose between 2 and 3 rows of icons on the start screen, the ability to set a personalized background under the "tiles", the ability to install customized lock screens and much more); <br>  - Word Flow keyboard with the support of "swipe gestures" and more developed intelligence (read - contextual prediction of words); <br>  - Updated application store and support for universal applications; <br>  - Separate volume for calls and applications (sic!); <br>  - Improved integration of social networking features Twitter and Facebook in the hub "People"; <br>  - Internet Explorer 11 with WebGL support and enhanced HTLM5 support; <br>  - Battery Power Sense to determine the programs most consumes battery power; <br>  And much more, including the already announced appearance of a file manager in the near future (!). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/926/dfc/7c3/926dfc7c3814433c0ddc4fa199a046ce.jpg"><br><br>  Nokia Lumia 930 on Windows Phone 8.1 has something to please business users.  In addition to the built-in Microsoft Office Mobile (Excel, Word, PowerPoint, and OneNote) and Skype, users can download a number of specialized applications, such as the Lync corporate messenger, for free. <br><br>  There are also enhanced Mobile Device Management (MDM) features.  They also extend to the ability to configure VPN, Exchange and SharePoint (and this is not all) for all employees at once.  As a result, staff will have even easier access to the company's services. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7e4/a03/bb8/7e4a03bb8c65705b1b230de0e9ad4516.jpg"><br><br>  The Lumia 930 smartphone is also equipped with automatically enabled support for VPN and S / MIME, automatic trapping of Wi-Fi networks and the ability to add certain applications for corporate users to the black or white list. <br><br><h4>  As an afterword </h4><br>  Speaking about the technical characteristics of the Nokia Lumia 930, we did not specifically dwell on the appearance of the device, because we had the opportunity to talk about this with the chief designer of Nokia. <br><br>  Jonne Harju has 10 years of experience in the design of Nokia mobile devices.  He began as the head of one of the design teams in Nokia Design, and today he is responsible for the design of all devices that are branded as Lumia.  Among the bright pages in his portfolio: a series of N-series devices on Symbian, Nokia N9 on MeeGo and, of course, all Lumia smartphones, starting with the 800th model. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4a6/ca0/763/4a6ca0763a02688065bd208884724f7e.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Many journalists who have already tested the Lumia 930 say that the device has a good balance between usability and an attractive appearance ...</b> <br><br>  When it comes to the design of Lumia devices, then everything we do is designed to make it as concise and minimalist as possible, without unnecessary details. <br><br>  In the case of the Lumia 930, as well as with the ‚Äúcarrier‚Äù Nokia Lumia Icon, we did everything to make the device simple and, at the same time, very attractive.  That is why we stopped at the combination of a laconic aluminum frame and a screen and a bright back panel that ideally combined with it. <br><br>  The smooth pillow shape of the back cover is a consequence of the lack of a protruding camera module, as on the Lumia 1020. This solution allowed us to return support for the wireless charger, like on the famous Nokia Lumia 920 and the flagship smartphone with a large screen Lumia 1520. In general, I think we managed achieve harmony between design and advanced technology. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/dc1/86f/759/dc186f759301ebf1a3f33a651ddf3f00.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Can this be called a new round in the development of the design of the Lumia line?</b> <br><br>  Definitely, the Lumia 930 has a lot in common with other Nokia devices, especially with the Lumia 925, but at the same time it is notable for its unique character.  This smartphone goes even deeper into the concept of simplicity, not only from an aesthetic point of view, but also from the point of view of the production process.  Monolithic aluminum body requires less time to produce it.  Everything related to the Lumia 930, as simplified as possible. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/75a/c72/074/75ac720742f097d17ac48864fc4b6795.jpg"><br><br>  <b>At Nokia, you have been designing for nearly ten years.</b>  <b>Do you think that in the design there is some kind of consistency, the peak of which fell on the Lumia line?</b> <br><br>  Yes, it was quite a long way!  The way we created phones in 2005 is completely different from what we are doing now.  In those days, everything revolved around creating a certain number of design options per year and inventing new images.  But then we started to go more from the technical component and user experience, and it bore fruit: we began to pay more and more attention to the selection of the most optimal combination of components for each device.  Creating new devices, we constantly learn from our experience and try to improve ourselves. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b66/9e6/109/b669e6109e75b024a395b17408a1bce7.jpg"><br><br>  <b>And what is the best design for you?</b> <br><br>  If we talk about Nokia, I really liked the first N9 device, because it changed the company in terms of how we began to look at the design of a mobile phone.  Generally speaking, it is simply amazing how Citro√´n boldly behaved, releasing the DS model.  At the time, this car looked incredibly futuristic, and even today, 50 years later, it is still great. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/dc6/e01/c14/dc6e01c1407af486cedaafd280cc4890.jpg"><br><br>  <b>How do you see the future of smartphones?</b> <br><br>  After some short period of time, we will better understand what goals the smartphone should serve and what its real concept is.  What should be its ideal size?  What should be the price?  What do users want to see in it?  Do they want to be constantly distracted by notifications?  Will people overcome the craving for constant network and communication with each other?  Should smartphones know when you are not in the best of spirits, and disable your email for this time?  Now in our industry a huge number of studies are being conducted that seek to find answers to such questions. <br>  We are an ‚Äúexperimental generation‚Äù, on whose behavior an opinion will be composed on what is needed in the future. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a8c/9c3/220/a8c9c3220935441ccd18c7ff8a9eb48d.png"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/227065/">https://habr.com/ru/post/227065/</a></p>
