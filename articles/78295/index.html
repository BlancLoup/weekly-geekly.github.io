  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Topics of the WebHiTech and WHT Party in Moscow</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> <a href="http://2009.webhitech.ru/party/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bcf/706/e58/bcf706e5875f96fc43cfe1322f8a1cd1.gif" alt="TSA + WebHiTech = WHT Party" align="left"></a>  Exactly a week ago, on December 8, a joint <a href="http://2009.webhitech.ru/party/">WHT Party</a> event took place in Moscow, combining the <a href="http://www.web-standards.ru/">web standards</a> development community mini-conference <a href="http://www.web-standards.ru/">‚ÄúWeb Standards‚Äù</a> (TSA) and the awards ceremony for the <a href="http://2009.webhitech.ru/winners/">winners of the WebHiTech contest</a> .  Unfortunately, your humble servant got around to publish a photo report from the event only last Sunday, and they got to Habr just now.  However, better late than <nobr>never.</nobr>  <nobr>:-)</nobr> So, we present to your attention a detailed <a href="http://2009.webhitech.ru/party/">photo of the WHT Party</a> consisting of almost 70 frames, where, besides the photos, you will find an archive of all the presentations of the reports, a link to the audio recordings of the performances, a rather detailed story about all this action and other interesting things things. <br><br>  I would like to congratulate the winners of the competition.  The following projects won first places in the nominations: <br><ul><li>  "The best design solution" - <a href="http://leeklamp.ru/">"Energy-saving lamps LEEK"</a> ; </li><li>  ‚ÄúThe best consumer qualities‚Äù - <a href="http://www.ica.tusur.ru/">‚ÄúInformation Center of the Applicant TUSUR‚Äù</a> ; </li><li>  ‚ÄúThe best use of technology‚Äù - <a href="http://lynchelka.ru/">‚ÄúLinkchka‚Äù</a> . </li></ul>  Colleagues, I would like this topic not to be limited to a purely informative role.  The organizers, jury members, nominees of the competition are extremely important feedback - please leave in the comments to this post your constructive criticism, your wishes, comments on the rules of the competition, on the organization of the WHT Party, on the quality of the nominated sites - in general, on any issues, so or otherwise related to WebHiTech.  Let this post be a continuation of the <s>banquet of the banquet</s> on December 8.  And may all those who failed, for one reason or another, personally participate in our event.  This will help us make WebHiTech better.  Well, and under a habrakat - some my personal impressions "for a seed". <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  <strong>On the results of the competition.</strong>  This year, the results are quite contradictory.  More controversial than <a href="http://2008.webhitech.ru/winners/">last year</a> , in my humble taste.  In any case, in the closed mailing list, where the participants of our jury communicate, heated discussions continued for several days after summing up.  Well, in particular, I personally fervently supported <a href="http://www.inviter.ru/">‚ÄúInviter‚Äù</a> , <a href="http://ft.vremenno.net/">‚ÄúVortex trainer‚Äù</a> and <a href="http://klavogonki.ru/">‚ÄúKlavogonka‚Äù</a> - I really wanted all three of these original, useful and soul-made projects (well, not single corporate sites because Runet is alive) came out the final, however, as a result, only two of them overcame this level - the latter lacked some unfortunate one point (this is a <a href="http://2009.webhitech.ru/press/10/">jury</a> 's <a href="http://2009.webhitech.ru/press/10/">assessment</a> ), which is even more offensive.

      At the same time, it seems to me personally that, for example, the <a href="http://www.ica.tusur.ru/">TUSUR</a> website took the first place in the consumer nomination, let's say, ‚Äúin advance‚Äù: too many, from my point of view, there are flaws on this site that it would not hurt to fix, to bring the project in compliance with the conquered place. <br><br>  Anyway, no one is going to review the results of the competition - this is the result of a fairly long and difficult collegial work of the jury.  And in general, the prizes and all the other buns are, by and large, only a kind of tool for attracting attention.  And our main mission is to educate in the direction of spreading respect for modern web standards among web developers.  Therefore, after the New Year holidays, we will no doubt continue to hold seminars on web standards in Moscow universities, various other seminars, sections at conferences and meetings - so stay tuned <nobr>.</nobr>  <nobr>:-)</nobr> However, competition is also very important;  we want it to be as objective and professional as possible.  The view from the outside is extremely important to us - perhaps it will help to somehow adjust, detail the <a href="http://2009.webhitech.ru/rules/">rules</a> for next year. <br><br>  <strong>About trends.</strong>  Undoubtedly, the sites announced for the contest still have room to grow.  Here are a few figures that I gave in my report about WebHiTech at the <a href="http://webstandardsdays.ru/">Web Standards Days</a> conference in Minsk, which, ironically, did not have time to voice directly at the WHT Party: <br><ul><li>  HTML 5 - found on exactly 0 projects; </li><li>  ‚ÄúTrue‚Äù XHTML is also on 0 projects; </li><li>  Client-side XML / XSLT - on 2 projects, <a href="http://www.ilicha.dn.ua/">one of which</a> reached the final; </li><li>  CSS3 properties, properties with prefixes -moz-, -webkit-, etc. - on about a third of the projects; </li><li>  JavaScript, AJAX - almost everywhere, and even the developers who reach the final do not bother themselves with warnings about the need for JavaScript support by browsers, which would be shown to those who have this JavaScript turned off for some reason. </li></ul>  Unfortunately, such a trend as the fact that independent creativity in RuNet is becoming less and less popular is not encouraging.  The creators of a number of sites (about a dozen in total) do not consider it shameful to declare projects based on the use of ready-made themes for various CMS to the contest.  No, let them use it for health, except that it‚Äôs completely unclear what our jury is offering to evaluate on such sites ... The author of one of the projects was found guilty of blatant plagiarism (and another participant of our competition pointed out the fact that the design concept was borrowed from his website) ). <br><br>  So it goes.  Well, you, colleagues, what opinions will be? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/78295/">https://habr.com/ru/post/78295/</a></p>
