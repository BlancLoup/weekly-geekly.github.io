In December, the conference will be held in Moscow for the second time - and will become two days.  If we recall the <a href="https://xkcd.com/605/">issue of</a> xkcd about extrapolation, it turns out that the Heisenbag-2380 will last all year round!  But more seriously, we are ready to announce a new event.  Under the cut we tell in detail what exactly to expect <b>on December 8-9</b> . <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Two-day format </h2><br>  The transition to a two-day conference is not just "the same thing two days in a row."  When there is only one day and many interesting speakers, I want to accommodate as many reports as possible in principle.  And when everything is not so tightly limited in time, there is an opportunity to ‚Äúbreathe deeply‚Äù - for example, to take breaks between reports longer. <br><br>  And then other components of the event, such as discussion zones, become more useful.  Each speaker after his report is sent to a specially equipped place where there is an opportunity to respond to questions from the audience (and not as usual, when questions are given five minutes at the end of the speech).  And in the case of short breaks, asking one speaker, it is easy to skip the report of another, and longer ones help to make it everywhere.

      Breaks are also useful for something else: chat with colleagues, take part in activity at the stands or simply take a break from the flow of information, then return freshened up and learn more.  And even the audience of the online broadcast, who are not present at the conference personally, will not be bored during long breaks: for them we are going to do interviews with the speakers on the air. <br><br>  So the number of reports compared to last year will increase, but not twice - but the benefits of attending the conference may well double. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/482/ef3/bb1/482ef3bb1937417c84eab313bca96aaa.jpg"><br><br><h2>  Topics </h2><br>  There are no major changes planned here: this is still "a conference about testing, but not only for testers."  We want to benefit various specialists by not building a wall between testers and developers, but by helping them find a common language.  We are interested in testing in all its manifestations: even automated, though manual, from mobile to gamedev, from the nuances of load testing to general tips that are useful to everyone (we will try to indicate as clearly as possible who is suitable for each report so that you don‚Äôt accidentally find out for you). <br><br>  The only thing we don‚Äôt want is a bullshit: useless marketing reports, vague reasoning about anything, chewing on the well-known basics.  We are for technical specifics. <br><br><h2>  Speakers </h2><br>  The list of speakers is now being formed, and the final will be ready closer to the conference.  But we can already name a number of names, giving a general idea of ‚Äã‚Äã‚Äúwhat is worth the wait‚Äù: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/6c9/b85/4f4/6c9b854f4737433dbfbd9d5aaf5571f0.jpg" align="left">  <b>Simon Stewart</b> is known as a member of the Selenium team and the creator of WebDriver.  It is not surprising that the theme of the report on Heisenbag will be connected with Selenium: it will be a question of scaling when using it.  What problems can be encountered when the number of tests rushes into space, and how to solve these problems? <br><br clear="left"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/8b2/789/e3e/8b2789e3e8c54bbaa841241962a5facf.jpeg" align="left">  <b>Artyom Eroshenko</b> is directly related to the Allure project, and in June at the St. Petersburg Heisenbag his report on Allure 2 turned out to be a favorite of the audience.  But Artem‚Äôs interests are not limited to Allure - and the speech at the Moscow conference will probably be devoted to something new. <br><br clear="left"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/137/55d/d72/13755dd72d4d4acdb2af328b301fc217.jpg" align="left">  <b>Ilari Henrik Egerter</b> spoke at both past Heisenbags (Moscow and St. Petersburg), both liked his appearances to the public - it‚Äôs not surprising that we‚Äôll be happy to see him in the third (and find out how long his beard will be this time).  However, we also received comments that his two speeches overlapped with each other too much.  We take this into account: the third will not be a repetition of the first two. <br><br clear="left"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/4d0/59c/5d4/4d059c5d49d54e3f825d1c59ea8f7908.jpg" align="left">  <b>Vladimir Sitnikov</b> is an expert in performance.  Many people know him as a committer of the JMeter load testing tool, but in December he will tell you about something else.  Often, the words "testing performance" means only testing the server side, and directly testing the browser is much less common - Vladimir intends to eliminate injustice and uncover this topic on Heisenbag. <br><br clear="left"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/6e8/963/dc3/6e8963dc34874475960f671b33f594dc.jpg" align="left">  In June, at the Petersburg Heisenbag, <b>Nikolai Alimenkov</b> <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/jugru/blog/330614/">brought a</a> tumult with his stormy discussion with Alexei Vinogradov, and his report then received very good reviews from the audience.  In Moscow in December he will also be very active: not only will he give a report, he will also conduct a training (read about this below). <br><br clear="left"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/bff/fa4/61b/bfffa461b0f34ca2ac2e51ac2023d821.jpg" align="left">  <b>Alexey Lavrenyuk</b> is known for his work on the Yandex.Tank project, and it is not surprising that at St. Petersburg Heisenbag spoke about load testing.  But Alexey also understands mobile testing - so do not be surprised if the topic of his winter performance in Moscow is very different. <br><br clear="left"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/20f/e65/c26/20fe65c263f44d4f85795f7899cacfe0.jpg" align="left">  <b>Anton Arkhipov</b> , whom Java developers have already been able to see at our Java conferences, will talk about how TestContainers helps to cope with an urgent problem - deploying a test environment for integration testing. <br><br clear="left"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/7aa/c05/af8/7aac05af80a5457199dce29705f83b02.jpg" align="left">  <b>Nikita Makarov</b> - Head of Test Automation at Odnoklassniki.  This means that his speeches are obviously interesting: when working on such a gigantic project, you inevitably get a lot of valuable experience, so there is something to share. <br><br><br clear="left"><h2>  Remote report </h2><br>  In addition to these speakers, there is also one special case.  <b>James Bach</b> can talk so vigorously and vividly about testing that one of his speeches has collected hundreds of thousands of views on YouTube: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ILkT_HV9DVU" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Apparently, the talent of the narrator is from his father: James is the son of Richard Bach, famous for the story ‚ÄúThe Seagull named Jonathan Livingston‚Äù.  In general, we would be glad to see him on Heisenbag, but the only option in which his speech at the conference is possible is a live online broadcast.  We have not performed in such a format before and do not know exactly how interesting this is for you, therefore we want to find out from you.  If you have an opinion on this subject - click on one of the three options <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/JBDG2017Msk">on the link</a> . <br><br><h2>  Nikolai Alimenkov's training </h2><br>  An event related to the conference: the next two days after it, December 10-11, <b>Nikolai Alimenkov</b> will be trained on the secrets of successful test automation.  This is a separate event with individual tickets (their sale will begin later) - but this is a convenient opportunity, having allocated four days in a row, to improve their skills in full, starting with the conference and continuing with the training. <br><br><h2>  Call for Papers </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/afb/025/a07/afb025a0793041cab289341ad6cfa443.jpg"><br><br>  If you want to see your name in the list of speakers - now is the time <a href="https://heisenbug-moscow.ru/callforpapers/"><b>to submit a report to us</b></a> !  Our strict program committee includes only really good performances in the program, but the same committee helps the speakers bring their promising developments to the right level - so even if you do not have relevant experience, but there is an interesting topic, do not be afraid to apply. <br><br>  And if you have experience, refer to the video recordings of reports that you did earlier, and this will significantly speed up the decision making by the program committee. <br><br>  The main requirement: your report should be useful to other testers / developers.  We are interested in the following topics: <br><br><ul><li>  Test automation; </li><li>  Stress Testing; </li><li>  Performance testing, benchmarking; </li><li>  Integration testing of modular / distributed systems; </li><li>  Concurrency testing; </li><li>  Testing mobile applications; </li><li>  Manual testing; </li><li>  UX, Security, A / B, static code analysis, code and product metrics, etc .; </li><li>  Instrumentation, environment for testing; </li><li>  Comparison tools for testing; </li><li>  Testing in gamedev. </li></ul><br><h2>  Program and Registration </h2><br>  Until December, many more reports will appear in the program, and first of all the information about them will be published on <a href="https://heisenbug-moscow.ru/">the</a> conference <a href="https://heisenbug-moscow.ru/">website</a> .  So if you need more information, just drop in there.  But for those who decide now, there is an important advantage: tickets will gradually go up, so now is the best time <a href="https://heisenbug-moscow.ru/tickets/">to get a</a> ticket. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/290/bb8/8e0/290bb88e07f948d392eb5a8b3cc49754.jpg"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/332704/">https://habr.com/ru/post/332704/</a></p>
