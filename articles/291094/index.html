Leadership lessons</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9ad/13e/444/9ad13e44454c40a2ad7f6683375efb3b.png" alt="Got" align="left">  The game of thrones is an excellent saga and exemplary film adaptation, which have passed into the phenomenon of mass culture with all its inherent attributes. <br><br>  When George Martin was writing a cycle of novels The Song of Ice and Flame, it was unlikely that his goals were to weave into the narrative advice for businessmen and entrepreneurs, but it just so happened that they were there.  In this case, I specify, but the above leadership lessons are suitable not only for entrepreneurs, of course.  Anyone can take advantage and change their lives so that it has fewer dramatic events resembling the plot of ‚ÄúGame of Thrones‚Äù. <br><br>  George Martin's world is full of unprovoked violence, black magic, unnatural connections and dragons, and fortunately with real life, the similarities are not enough.  If you throw it all away, you will get a simple story about how to become the best: the best warrior, the best ruler, the best politician and the best kingdom.  And this is directly related to the business and way of thinking.  So what leadership lessons can you learn from the history of the Seven Kingdoms? <a name="habracut"></a>

    <h4>  Vigilance is a virtue </h4><br>  The ninth series of the third season brought out my brain once and for all.  By the time I have not read the series before this point, so the "Red Wedding" was for me a complete surprise. <br><br>  The wedding of Edmur Tally with Roslyn Frey in the walls of Gemini.  Walder Frey and another standard-bearer of Robb, Ruse Bolton, staged a massacre at a wedding feast in which the unsuspecting Robb Stark and his entire retinue were brutally murdered. <br><br>  In my opinion, this episode in ‚ÄúGame of Thrones‚Äù is one of the most striking in its meanness and cruelty.  Here I would like to mention the work of George Martin, he wets his goodies with bundles, regardless of the opinion of the public, like Conan Doyle, who was forced to resurrect Sherlock Holmes. <br><br>  Everything shown was extremely cruel, but from a business point of view, it is quite natural and teaches us a simple lesson. <br><br><h3>  Always be alert and focused on what you are doing. </h3><br><br><h4>  Never underestimate yourself </h4><br>  If you watched the show, you probably know the phrase: ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt know anything, John Snow!‚Äù <br><br>  Ironically, in general, the phrase is very far from the truth.  The illegitimate son of Lord Eddard Stark, Snow quickly moved from the position of a white crow (there is also some irony, in English this idiom sounds like being a black sheep, being the black sheep) to the position of the head of the Night Watch.  What is the reason for such personal growth?  It's simple, John Snow is not only brave, intelligent and smart, but also a meditating hero who believes in himself and the strength of his weapon, while not afraid to follow his instincts - and this, as we know, is a quality inherent in every good leader. <br><br>  As a result, he won the respect of almost all around, even the "wild".  While others in the Seven Kingdoms were doing anything other than the Seven Kingdoms, John Snow stood on the Wall and during that time turned into someone who could take part in the Battle for the Iron Throne on equal terms with the rest. <br><br><h3>  No matter how weak you are, never underestimate yourself. </h3><br><br><h4>  Fortune loves the brave </h4><br>  With their militancy and power, the Dothraki could become a formidable force for all the peoples of the saga.  However, the Lannisters, Starks, and Baratheons are not afraid of them for one simple reason: Dothraki are afraid of the sea, and everyone knows about it.  Therefore, despite all their fighting skills and huge numbers, the fear of the nomads before the sea turns out to be a basin of concrete for them. <br><br>  In technological analogies, Dothraki like BlackBerry is a big fish in their little pond that doesn‚Äôt pay attention to the possibilities of touch control.  All this time, Apple has been looking for new features.  As a result, the BlackBerry is suffering huge losses, and Apple has turned the entire smartphone market upside down and has earned it. <br><br><h3>  Get the courage to transcend your fears and fate will thank you. </h3><br><br><h4>  Empowering staff, reap the rewards </h4><br>  Deineris Targaryen is a unique girl, possessing enviable beauty, she is not devoid of mind and natural leadership qualities.  If the content of the saga depended on me, I would have long dispersed everyone with a filthy broom (in Martin's style with rivers of blood), and she would already be sitting on a chair from Vtorchermet. <br><br>  For all the time of the story, she has repeatedly surprised by wit and intelligence, but most of all I liked the moment of the release of ‚Äúflawless‚Äù.  After this, the service of ideal warriors moved to a qualitatively different level.  The liberated ‚Äúflawless‚Äù, doubling or even tripling efforts, showed passion and loyalty to the one who liberated them. <br><br>  Any business that replaces the need for voluntary choice will be superior to its competitors.  The ability to inspire employees is a rare skill that cannot be overstated. <br><br>  If you approach the work from the standpoint of the game and interest employees, the results will surpass all the wildest expectations.  What can we say about the work "under the lash"? <br><br><h3>  Inspiration will always give better results than intimidation, even if you have a dragon for it. </h3><br><br><h4>  A real tutor will always stay with you. </h4><br>  <i>‚ÄúSean Bean is dead!</i>  <i>Long live Sean Bean! ‚ÄùThe</i> head of the House of Starks died at the very beginning of the saga, and yet his shadow continues to participate invisibly in this action.  Our real teachers and mentors will stay with us for life.  Their teachings and advice will pass with us, and then we will pass them on to our children and students, such is the chain of generations. <br><br>  Such principles can be learned from the entertainment series, if you look at it not as a ‚Äúcud‚Äù for the brain, but thoughtfully and slowly.  Think what you see, and see when you think. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/291094/">https://habr.com/ru/post/291094/</a></p>
