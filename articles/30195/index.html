I would like to hear from you what you don‚Äôt like, where major usability errors are made, and how would you solve this problem?  The target audience of Cars.ru is people who want to buy and sell a car, as well as find the necessary and useful information for car owners.  In the near future, several large content sections will be added to this. <br><br>  In short, what we want to fix is: improve usability and navigation, page perception, <br>  more efficient use of space under the announcements of the internal sections of the site, <br>  reduce the number of departures from the main page, effectively place blocks for the sale of advertising, so that everyone is happy - both advertisers and ordinary visitors. <br><br>  We conducted a small survey among people of various interests and professions, asked what they did not like on our main page.  Got pretty funny answers, here are some of them. <a name="habracut"></a>

      <strong>PS</strong> Those who are too lazy to read, we have highlighted the main thoughts that are present in almost all the comments. <br>  It is also very important for us to hear your professional opinion! <br>  <em>‚ÄúIt would be nice to make less space for news blocks and search for ads, due to this, allocate space for blocks of other sections of the site.</em>  <em>Leave only one general search in the database of ads, and not a bunch of search forms and fields that actually lead to one search result.</em>  <em>Everyone is annoyed by the abundance of flashing advertising. "</em> <br><br>  Max, 27 years old, programmer: <br><br>  Infuriates advertising "Honda" in the center.  A set of categories with ads for sale, and in the middle - some sort of garbage.  Search for doing - the same thing.  I just want a list of all Audi Olroad, and here in the center of garbage. <br><br>  Lena, 21, PR manager: <br><br>  If I were a car owner and I‚Äôd look for a car, I would say that everything is conveniently located in principle ... Only the huge advertising banners are right beside me.  Very annoying red especially ... Well, there is still a lot of somehow ... Eyes spread ... General impression?  I can't, this idiotic banner to the right distracts me ... Well, I think everything is quite normal.  It's nice that at once all brands of cars in the alphabetical list are listed. <br><br>  Seryozha, 26 years old, programmer: <br><br>  It looks like cars.auto.ru something.  UAZ-452 no.  Some kind of garbage pop up.  Pictures of the fuck machines are not needed in the news, they are too small - only they strain the eye, you still can not see anything.  Headings and news should be on the sides.  A mold with the sale-search cars up.  The only thing I do not know where you have advertising there.  I have it chopped.  News of the day to remove the fuck, and the place will be full.  On the right, you have an advertisement, apparently - to do less.  I would go somewhere about McDonald‚Äôs to make people annoy.  Such a huge clown Ronald, and such a jumps and flashes: ‚Äúonly this month, fillet-o-meat‚Äù.  And so flashes in red letters.  And a child with blooming joy mug. <br><br>  Katya, 23 years old, PR manager: <br><br>  I do not like: a lot of small parts, flashing banners, a rustic font.  Everything is on a white field, without boundaries, so it‚Äôs not immediately clear where they are.  And yet there is no single style in the design.  And I like it from a functional point of view: rubrication, a lot of useful information.  Why do you have two blocks of search: one on top and double on the bottom? .. By the way, the second block is like: just looking for a new one or with a mileage.  I would have divided the blocks more clearly - at least the side blocks from the central one (‚ÄúUrgently‚Äù and ‚ÄúDeals of car dealerships‚Äù).  And the lower headings in the basement - I do not know what to do with them.  They are important, but you need to screw them up :) <br><br>  Masha, 26 years old, programmer: <br><br>  Well, the site as a site.  I do not really understand.  Beeches are many.  I just had Firefox dropped on it :) And on top of a blue background - what?  I thought that the sale, but it goes below.  I wonder where to look for.  It is necessary and there and there to choose, or what?  In a sense, I understand that it is not necessary both there and there, but in general it confuses.  Design as a design, such colors right now are often found.  A lot of diverse information, it is not clear what the site is about.  In general, it is not clear to whom this is all oriented at all.  Who fumbles in the car - probably notice that everything is crammed.  And who does not fumble - he knows only about auto.ru :) This is the type of my critical opinion) The colors on loveplanet are similar :) <br><br>  Anton, 20 years old, an architect student: <br><br>  In the "Opera" did not fit circles from the survey.  The blank bar above is incomprehensible.  News from above would be better divided into blocks today, yesterday ... places like bulk.  Everything is full of.  There are a lot of underscore options, font sizes ... And in general it‚Äôs quite variegated - you don‚Äôt immediately get it.  I propose to leave the search on top, and then mega-link to the news ... and then it‚Äôs not clear what is where ... It's bad that there are two searches.  On the blue arrow one, and then divided below.  It is not clear where to look for something better. <br><br>  Andrey, 27 years old, designer: <br><br>  In general, the impression is not repulsive - the site is made neat, clean and modern.  But it was hard for me to navigate on this information overflowed page - a little messy done.  The type of usability suffers.  The logo "Kars.ru" disappears on the sheet, and this is bad - you get into a noisy place, but you do not understand what. <br><br>  Pavlik, 26 years old, programmer: <br><br>  The first thought - again forgot to put adblock.  Three flash ads on the page - inspire.  It is not clear what the arrow points to.  Ajax pleases.  But when you stick on our cars, the window opens right under the flash advertisement) Firefox 3.0, Ubunt. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/30195/">https://habr.com/ru/post/30195/</a></p>
