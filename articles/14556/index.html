  <section class="page js-page"><h1>five%</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Two months ago, I wrote a program for creating skins of one of the popular IM.  At the forum I met a man, also a programmer, started a conversation, reviewed the author's mistakes, flaws and so on.  And the devil pulled me to say, "Why not try?".  ‚ÄúCome on,‚Äù my future partner answered.  And went - gone. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The development of ICQ was ten times more complicated than creating simple utilities for copying images and displaying them. <br><br>  And where no problem?, Nowhere. <br>  First, the documentation of the protocols.  OSCAR (on which ICQ works) is a closed protocol, plus descriptions in English only.  Skype is the same song, people get money from it.  However, not everything is so bad.  There is a Mail.Ru Agent, there is an IRC, there is a Jabber ... <br><br>  Secondly, you need to think everything over.  Not a matter of ‚Äúdrawing‚Äù a program, and then correcting it.  When I wrote these words to him, I did not think that this would go so far.  Man literally thinks everything out.  Is it convenient for the user?  What will happen if suddenly the smile does not load?  What if the plugin will damage the kernel.  What do you need to make the core?  What are the ways to protect this very core?  Pixel transparency?  And so on‚Ä¶ <br>  During the long discussions on the ‚Äúweight‚Äù of the program, it was decided to dwell on the technology ‚ÄúCore with VCL and two access levels + Plugins, with and without license‚Äù. <br>  It was decided to develop the algorithm of certification of tested plug-ins that do not change or harm both the user and the program themselves and protect them with two keys ...

      Thirdly.  Title.  Need something interesting, memorable and short.  Anyone there mICQ, bICQ and other letters ICQ will not go.  Since the program will be easy, there will be little and generally .., it was decided to call it Lite Instant MEssenger.  Or LIME.  Or lime.  With the logo and other nonsense there are no problems, the images of lime on the network are in bulk, we will buy in the end.  Draw yourself on the end of the world. <br><br>  So, the development <br>  Now there is a final fit and testing of the smilepicker.  For example, who does not know what smilepiker - a window with smiles from ICQ.  In the course of a number of improvements even on weak machines, the reproduction of a hundred animated emoticons did not eat more than ten percent, keeping on five or seven.  Checking another IM and opening the window with 49 smiles, we received 18-22 percent. <br><br>  Convenient features are added, such as ‚ÄúI see where I poke‚Äù, as psychologists say there, it improves perception (highlighted selected smiley is optional), Displaying broken smilies (as well as a hint, depending on the case - how to fix) tracking the cursor ... In general, everything is thought out.  And this is only Smallpacker, and this is only 5%. <br><br>  The product promises to be very fast, very beautiful (with the ability to change almost anything your heart desires), and of course free and with the support of all possible protocols on this planet (not immediately, of course). <br><br>  Yes, there are many other programs.  But we will try to do the best, putting all the knowledge and all the time to improve and refine. <br><br>  I hope you will be interested to read such "reports" on the work done. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/14556/">https://habr.com/ru/post/14556/</a></p>
