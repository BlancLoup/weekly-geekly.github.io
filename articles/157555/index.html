  <section class="page js-page"><h1>ISTQB certification for testers: why and how</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The discipline of testing in the expanses of our country is still continuing to grow rapidly.  This statement may seem controversial.  But I see more and more people who want to approach testing more structured, consciously, ‚Äúscientifically‚Äù.  These people are interested in not only the question ‚Äúhow‚Äù, but also the questions ‚Äúwhy‚Äù and ‚Äúwhy‚Äù.  I meet such people more and more often at work, at testers meetings, in beginner classes that I teach. <br><br>  People ask me and each other a question: what should a tester read?  How to tighten your knowledge to the level of your experience?  My answer is to read as much as possible.  But, as in any activity, rationality does not hurt.  Can you read a little less, but get more value?  My answer is that this can be done with ISTQB certification.  Preparation for the exam will give a good overview of the knowledge that can be useful tester.  Having passed the exam, you will receive a documentary proof of knowledge. <br><br>  Let's see how ISTQB certification can be useful to you as a tester. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><ul><li>  You will increase your chances for better job placement or promotion.  If Junior is still forgivable to possess only a small amount of simple practical skills, then more and more testers are expected from more experienced testers.  One should no longer simply know ‚Äúhow‚Äù, but also know which alternatives can be, and which ones are preferable in which situations, and why. </li><li>  You will improve your position in the labor market.  I do not have reliable statistics, there are so many testers in Ukraine now.  But there are statistics on certification <a href="http://usqb.org.ua/index.php/ru/o-nas">usqb.org.ua/index.php/ru/o-nas</a> .  As you can see, the number of certified grows, and if you suddenly want to change jobs, it is better to be among them than among uncertified ones.  And in other countries for which we, as a rule, work, this certificate is in even greater demand (240 thousand certified).  Having it, you will immediately gain an advantage, even at the initial screening of a resume. </li><li>  And in general, you will become more in demand.  There are people who received their positions some time ago and now can afford to fall behind life, using their knowledge base three years ago.  Can we afford it?  Everyone decides for himself.  But we must remember that every current state of things is for the time being.  And it is better to update and expand your knowledge and skills.  And certification is one of the good ways to do this. </li><li>  You will expand your knowledge.  Having experience in one or two companies, it is impossible to see their specialty in all its breadth.  If you do not read, your outlook is limited to a very small part of reality.  More knowledge will help you make better decisions and argue them in front of your bosses and colleagues. </li><li>  You will be more creative!  Creative in solving your everyday tasks, in improving your testing processes. Where do new ideas come from?  Yes - from what you already know.  There are such people: Scott Berkun is a famous creativity coach.  Jurgen Apello is the bestselling author of Management 3.0.  Both in one form or another teach us that under certain conditions, the brain combines what it already knows and produces new findings, new knowledge.  How it happens: You heard something on the radio, read something, ran into a situation, talked to a person.  The brain remembered it all as a set of facts.  After that, some small next event is enough - and an insight comes or an idea comes - the brain combined, put together what he already knew.  But for this, something needs to be laid there :) Certification gives new knowledge, it fills in the gaps and systematizes what you already know.  It increases the quantity and improves the quality of what our brain will make ideas from. </li></ul>

      How to prepare for ISTQB certification?  Ways everyone has their own.  I will give recommendations based on my own experience and communication with those who have passed or are preparing for the exam. <br><br><ul><li>  Accept the information given to you in the materials as it is.  Most of you already have practical experience in testing, and you have already got used to some terminology that is used where you work.  But!  Do not think that the information in the book is wrong, just because you have a different experience.  The information in the materials is often presented in a generalized style.  But that is why it is full and true - you just need to be able to understand it and compare it with your reality.  Do this if there is a desire to reject what is written as wrong!  This is a very good exercise - this is what each great specialist does: combines his experience with theory and gains an understanding of how to act in a particular situation. </li><li>  Make every effort to correctly understand all the terms!  Very many exam questions are built on the knowledge of terms.  This is the basis without which to pass the exam is very unlikely. </li><li>  Start as early as possible!  The volume is rather big, and in a week it may not fit in the head. </li><li>  Prefer short frequent training sessions over long and rare ones.  A good practice will be to read every day 10-20 pages. </li><li>  Make notes in the text of materials.  Outline.  Again, the material is great, and repetition is the mother of learning.  Reading a 300-page book and an 80-page Syllabus are not so easy several times, and maybe not rational.  Create your own compressed version, and read it many times!  Read deliberately, not diagonally.  Recall examples from your actual practice that relate to what you are reading.  If you cannot understand what you yourself wrote the day before yesterday - look in the book and correct it - and read more! </li><li>  Solve problems!  The ability to answer questions and solve problems is not the same as knowing a theory.  And the exam consists of questions and tasks.  No matter how many times you read a book or a synopsis, you won‚Äôt know what you will actually have to face in the exam.  And you do not get self-reliance.  The number of tasks in the public domain is limited, and at the exam you will probably not get what you trained for at 99%.  It's not scary - solving even what is available to you, you will get the skill that, together with your knowledge of the theory, will provide a high result. </li><li>  Get ready in groups!  You can consult with those who prepare more carefully.  Or, on the contrary, to act as a leader and pull up others, at the same time arranging your own thoughts.  Because, as you know, when you teach another, you learn it yourself.  Therefore, find yourself someone who is also preparing for the exam.  Let it be even 1-2 people.  But meet regularly.  Share your readings.  Discuss the material in the context of your practical experience.  Being engaged in a group, it is easier to reach the goal for two more motivational reasons.  First, it's more fun!  You will be engaged more willingly :) Secondly, you undertake an obligation Publicly!  And to refuse such an obligation is much harder and more painful than a promise made to oneself, not in the ear, on the way from work. </li></ul><br><br>  Summing up, I will say that there are enough reasons to get an ISTQB-certificate.  If you read the literature on testing, the knowledge gained in preparing for certification will be a good addition to your current examination.  If you do not read, then this is very good material to start. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/157555/">https://habr.com/ru/post/157555/</a></p>
