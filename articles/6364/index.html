  <section class="page js-page"><h1>RIF 11</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I used to prepare for RIFs thoroughly: I gave interviews, booked a room or was announced as a speaker (Rife read four reports in the past - this time Alexander Militsky was going to surpass my record).  This year, impromptu broke loose, but here it is full and even won a bottle of moonshine at a RIFA banquet at a banquet.  I sang a song with the words "... when our websites become last year‚Äôs web, it will become a spectacle, everything that seemed to us like bread ...".  But it was the report from RIF that I wanted to start this blog. <br><br>  Roman Filippov, the administrator of AdRiver, stepped onto the stage to immediately declare that in the past year the revolution in the media Internet advertising did not happen.  And that in 2007 it will not happen either.  Small business has gone into context, large business does not have enough places to accommodate.  The context is no longer catch up (and in 2000, the turnover of RLE was more than the turnover of Yandex).  Multiscreen and other technologies of displaying several banners on one advertising space per one page load partially solve the problem of lack of space.  But not dramatically. <br><br>  Breakthrough in the field of video advertising also did not happen.  But there is a good side.  Videos on the Internet are shown non-coercively - the display is targeted and launched by the user, and the videos must be creative.  Video advertising on the Internet allows you to attract professionals.  Creative banner advertising in RuNet (including flash) is low.  And then, they say, luminaries will come ...

      There is still hope for non-standard interaction with the site visitor.  What it is?  If you speak my language - it is like a miracle, which is why it seems so that the other simply does not fit.  If to speak in the words of Filippov, it will be approximately the same: ‚Äúan advertisement that is not one for all‚Äù  If to speak the generally accepted term - this is a behavioral targeting. <br><br>  The most interesting thing about Filippov‚Äôs report is that innovation in online advertising has slowed down precisely because there are not enough success stories.  It turns out that customers of advertising agencies usually formulate their wishes in the form of "make us as well as ...".  That is, the advertising community is a community of epigones!  Then it becomes clear why Gagin is so worn with collecting cases for his ‚ÄúMedia Revolution‚Äù.  I thought that the most valuable information is the <i>history of failure</i> .  Scientists symposia allow you to find out what you are going on in the wrong way in backroom conversations, because scientific publications only report on someone's success.  Accordingly, the most valuable information was for me that, for example, the media is not working now for e-commerce (except for the post-effect), or that online quizzes do not increase the number of readers of online newspapers now ... <br><br>  Then another speaker, Sergey Zhuravlev, suggested the term ‚Äúmedia waves‚Äù. <br><a name="habracut"></a>  Media waves make up advertising actions with one advertising message.  One advertising message can have several variants of slogans, but the essence that it conveys is the same (and, accordingly, combined with the term ‚Äúmessage‚Äù).  After each of the waves recoil is studied ... well, this is understandable. <br><br>  Sergey Spivak read an absolutely wonderful report on regional Internet advertising.  Along the way, I learned from him the definition of the American term "clatter" - advertising noise on a single web page.  Spivak made for his presentation 30 screenshots of the provincial Internet with errors in the placement of advertising space.  But at the last moment he wore them out of his presentation.  Say, while the advertiser is eating, you shouldn‚Äôt spoil commerce for people.  But the current advertising platforms in the regions will be taught, according to Spivak, second-tier sites - on the unfortunate example of the current local leaders. <br><br>  From the backroom news of the first day - the sale of Finmarket to Interfax and Ozone - Cisco.  Well, or this is news for me personally, since I have not read about this in the Internet press. <br><br>  And Yuri Synods, as I understand it, right on the forum quit (since May) from Vebplaneta.  Will he have to change his login on Habr√©? <br><br>  PS <a href="http://volk.livejournal.com/778036.html%3Fmode%3Dreply">Cyrillic Livejournal statistics</a> , announced by Anton Nosik on the second day of the RIF. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/6364/">https://habr.com/ru/post/6364/</a></p>
