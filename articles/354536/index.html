  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The experience of the transition to the Atlassian Stride (from the word Suffer)</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/a1/6x/9t/a16x9tbxblcza7pqbxkdcxnlfiu.jpeg"></p><br><p>  Due to the blocking of the telegram, it would be important to write about the Atlassian Stride, how we switched to it, and what pleasures the solutions from the beloved Atlassian encountered. </p><br><p>  Atlassian Stride was launched in November 2017 as a replacement for cloud-based HipChat.  De facto, the main competitor is, of course, Slack.  I will try to compare Stride with Slack, and Telegram from the text correspondence. </p><br><h3 id="plyusy">  pros </h3><br><h4 id="vstraivanie-v-ekosistemu-atlassian-kontrol-za-polzovatelyami">  Embedding in the Atlassian Ecosystem, user control </h4><br><p>  The biggest plus is, of course, seamless integration into the Atlassian ecosystem.  You have jira, confluence - and a single user account, where you can control access to different pieces and features of these two applications.  And now you have the third application - Stride, and chat user management is available from the same admin panel. </p><a name="habracut"></a><br><p>  Accordingly, not only the resolution, but also full control, with the transparency of the chat, and removing the user from all applications simultaneously (jira, confluence, bitbucket, ..., stride) comes from one admin area.  Even the right to configure the old admins do not have much. </p><br><p>  In the telegraph we had personal accounts, and this did not work well with control over them by the organization (certainly, it would be possible to distribute virtual numbers and make corporate accounts, but this is too inconvenient to maintain).  So if you are locked into the Atlassian ecosystem and infrastructure -&gt; it‚Äôs convenient to have Stride as a platform for calls and messaging. </p><br><p>  In terms of price, Stride $ 3 / user, which is cheaper than Slack. </p><br><h4 id="videozvonki">  Video calls </h4><br><p>  For some, this is not such a big plus, but after the Telegram (IM) + Skype bundle (calls) it has become much more convenient to have everything in one application. </p><br><h4 id="integraciya-s-produktami-atlassian-cherez-botov">  Integration with Atlassian products via bots </h4><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/z0/og/iy/z0ogiy1zqdssa9zywvco-ccwoii.png"></p><br><p>  It is not something out of the box, but nevertheless it is configured in two clicks.  After inserting the ticket number, we will see a preview-card of the task, with information about the priority, to whom the description is assigned, components. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ml/nd/xt/mlndxt0bcb4zhrzvvm2rzmmepyw.png"></p><br><ul><li>  You can create tasks for the chat bot commands, ala "create bug CI server is the third day in project% projectName%". </li><li>  And, you can poke those who test PR in the beatback, which are especially forgetful.  Also through the bot. </li></ul><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/bz/_r/uc/bz_ruco5zorq8lnv3cnme3tpjvq.png"></p><br><h3 id="stradanie">  Suffering </h3><br><p>  With the seemingly Stride, this is a normal platform, it is still raw, and those basic features that we consider should be present by default in any product with messaging, are implemented in it crookedly. </p><br><h4 id="videozvonki-1">  Video calls </h4><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/hu/xk/ri/huxkrip7zoygsjxlflvkng57anq.png"></p><br><p>  To begin with, I‚Äôll make a remark that Slack is bad in video calls, and we haven‚Äôt found anything better than Skype in quality.  But Stride breaks through the Slack-ovskoy bottom!  In particular, </p><br><ul><li>  Swears at the bad internet connection, when other platforms do not swear. </li><li>  People are thrown from calls from time to time </li><li>  Beautifully animates the transition from one speaker to another.  But beauty requires sacrifice - and the stride crashes during the fade in / fade out effect on the poppy.  Not always, of course, but several times caught already. </li><li>  Video lag, sound like no. </li><li>  The video freezes, and only on the other side of the phone.  Until you restart the application, it will hang like this. </li><li>  RAM consumption (400mb), CPU consumtion 70%, on quite weak processors.  This is a lot. </li><li>  When you fumble the screen, and the stride window falls into the poke-through area, the image forms a ‚Äúwell‚Äù with the window caught and then crashes. </li><li>  Since Stride eats away a lot of resources, the sharing of the screen, and in general, everything else on the same mbp pro 13 "i5 2014 starts to slow down. With Slack / Skype, this is much less noticeable. </li></ul><br><p>  Okay, enough about video calls, there are a lot of other disadvantages! </p><br><h4 id="bazovyy-funkcional">  Basic functionality </h4><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/f3/gd/y7/f3gdy7r74ezjhr9ymcbzvnq8aug.png"></p><br><ul><li>  No hashtags (uncomfortable) </li><li>  Mentally painful to send messages (slow) </li><li>  It is physically painful to send messages with attachments (the stride will not allow you to send and will not make the send button active until the file is loaded (long), and then it will typically be a long time to send a message). </li><li>  Forwarding between rooms is not present, respectively, it is impossible to fumble information between rooms in a convenient, only copy / paste. </li></ul><br><h4 id="opovescheniya">  Alerts </h4><br><p>  Argued that the products Stride'a set the task of the team to make the most invisible sound alert.  Mission accomplished! <br>  The sound is so invisible that if you listen to music, it is difficult to notice.  If you left, then the background noise in the office will easily block the sound of the notification (someone will say, they say, then you will come and see the notification on the screen - read on =).  Accordingly, a person may simply not notice and not respond to an important message (for example, the server crashes or tests in Jenkins). </p><br><p>  There is no mute function for chats, which means that there is a lot of unnecessary noise and pop-ups. </p><br><p>  No indication "message read."  And it is not clear, poke a colleague so that he looked, or he is already aware of the problem. </p><br><p>  The phone does not receive a third-quarter alert.  But when they come - then there is a chance not to get them on the desktop application!  It happens, you see a long message in the phone, you climb to read from the laptop - but it is not there.  Treated with a restart strayd. </p><br><h4 id="jira-bot">  Jira bot </h4><br><p>  Let's be honest, integration with Jira in the same Slack is currently more convenient than in Stride.  Jira Bot will throw out thumbnails of tickets of such size that the closest analogy in my head is a worm that was used to dig cities in Gears of War 2 ‚Äî ticket cards take so much space. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xe/tw/zc/xetwzcbgzz5vqnfapjf4ab5il5a.png"></p><br><h4 id="json-i-api">  JSON and API </h4><br><p>  As our DevOps have noticed, Stride should be fed exclusively with parted JSON, he himself refuses to do this (as Telegram) </p><br><h3 id="v-ostatke">  In the rest </h3><br><p>  Stride is a normal, working solution.  It does not make communication impossible, and if you are not critical of the disadvantages described above, and you care for and cherish the Atlassian ecosystem (even after new updates to the Jira interface), then it is really convenient.  We, in general, have become more accustomed, and are watching the dynamics of bug fixes and adding features.  But if you do not need it, and you already use Slack, then it is easier to sit on it. </p><br><p>  The guys in Stride are in a hurry with the updates, trying to fix the shortcomings in order of priority, known only to the product manager of the Australians (who leaves critical comments on Jira hang in feature request for 7 years).  Telegram and Slack have been developing for years, to become a good and convenient solution.  I think, and Stride comes to this, time will tell.  However, the practice of blocking shows that Stride (Amazon Cloud) and Slack are unavailable in Ufa, and Telegram, as usual, is still working. </p><br><h3 id="otpravlennye-rekvesty-v-task-treker-stride">  Sent Requests to Stride Task Tracker </h3><br><ul><li>  Default Notification Sound - Cannot be changed ( <a href="https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/">https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/</a> <br>  STRIDE-578) </li><li>  No read indication <a href="https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/STRIDE-66">https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/STRIDE-66</a> </li><li>  Lags and drops <a href="https://getsupport.atlassian.com/servicedesk/customer/portal/40/">https://getsupport.atlassian.com/servicedesk/customer/portal/40/</a> <br>  STRD-2580 </li><li>  Periodically absent notifications ( <a href="https://jira.atlassian.com/">https://jira.atlassian.com/</a> <br>  browse / STRIDE-1989) </li><li>  Mute Chat <a href="https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/STRIDE-2196">https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/STRIDE-2196</a> </li><li>  Forwarding ( <a href="https://getsupport.atlassian.com/servicedesk/customer/portal/40/">https://getsupport.atlassian.com/servicedesk/customer/portal/40/</a> <br>  STRD-2579) </li><li>  Bugs with notifications in MacOS <a href="https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/STRIDE-1848">https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/STRIDE-1848</a> </li><li>  You can not reply to <a href="https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/STRIDE-104">https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/STRIDE-104</a> </li><li>  No sorting by recent posts in sidebar, for groups <a href="https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/">https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/</a> <br>  STRIDE-2077 </li><li>  <a href="https://getsupport.atlassian.com/servicedesk/customer/portal/40/STRD-2581">https://getsupport.atlassian.com/servicedesk/customer/portal/40/STRD-2581</a> </li><li>  Slow sending of pictures <a href="https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/STRIDE-2102">https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/STRIDE-2102</a> </li></ul></div>
