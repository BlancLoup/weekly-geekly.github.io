We will not deeply understand the essence of these concepts.  It is only important to understand that IP telephony is the same telephone connection, but instead of a telephone line - a dedicated copper pair - a data network is used, for example, the one through which you access the Internet. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  <font color="#91c848">Why pay more?</font> </h2><br>  In our difficult times, many are already thinking about how to abandon the traditional landline phone.  One was bored with endless advertising calls, others had long since switched to using a mobile phone.  And why pay for a telephone line that you do not use when there is a mobile connection and the Internet?  But not everything is so simple.  In a number of situations ‚Äî when you receive a bank loan, a visit to a doctor, etc. ‚Äî you may be required to give you a home number, not a mobile phone.  Yes, and your grandmother is accustomed to the traditional device, with a mobile phone can not be controlled in any way.

      Moscow telephone number without monthly fee.  Is it possible?  Full  And there are <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/95657/">several options</a> .  Consider the simplest, when you do not need to bother with the purchase of equipment - all provide the provider.  And even the old analog phone will not need to be changed if it is dear to you as a memory.  The device will work as before.  And even better if we talk about sound quality and functions. <br><br>  Users of OnLime (Rostelecom) have such an opportunity, who can connect the <a href="http://www.onlime.ru/phone/about/">Home Phone</a> service free of charge and as a result receive a Moscow number as a free addition to the Internet and a starter kit of equipment.  What we get as a result?  City number (it is provided in code 499 or 495), city, mobile, long-distance and international telephone communication at favorable rates (low prices for outgoing calls), free services (automatic caller ID - Caller ID, call hold, call forwarding), the ability to connect additional services (anti-caller ID, changing numbers, favorite destination). <br><br>  All this - in the absence of fees for the subscriber line and any additional mandatory monthly payments.  Only conversations are paid.  And no upfront costs.  Everything is free: connection, equipment, number selection, number identifier.  You only need to pay for calls, and the <a href="http://www.onlime.ru/phone/calc2/">tariffs are</a> quite reasonable and cheaper than similar services of competitors. <br><br>  Local calls from the on-line home phone are charged at 50 kopecks.  for 1 minute of connection with subscribers of city telephony in Moscow and 1.5 rubles.  for 1 minute of connection with mobile phones in Moscow and the Moscow region.  For long-distance and international calls, there are three tariff plans and several Options for directions.  The options make it possible to make calls to selected regions of Russia (to selected foreign countries) at a low price, and the ‚ÄúZero within the network‚Äù option allows you to make free calls to Rostelecom subscribers throughout Russia (100 minutes daily). <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1ed/bc5/670/1edbc5670a9345c6bfc94197f845cce0.jpg"></div><br><h2>  <font color="#91c848">Always with you</font> </h2><br>  This home phone has another huge plus.  When moving to a new Moscow apartment phone number - a direct number in the code 499/495 - will remain with you.  This is especially convenient for those who rent housing.  However, transferring the MGTS telephone number to ONLIM will not work: for the fixed-line networks, the law on number portability does not work yet, although technically this possibility exists. <br><br>  Just as in MGTS, to use a landline phone you need to connect to the operator‚Äôs network (in our case, the OnLime network).  And if you turn off the electricity, the phone does not work if you do not have an uninterruptible power supply.  However, GPON users from MGTS will not work either.  Perhaps these are the only drawbacks. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#91c848">How to connect?</font> </h2><br>  The procedure for connecting the service "Home Phone" is simple.  You submit an application through your personal account, you are called back and specified the address and convenient installation time.  When ordering services you will be offered a choice of five rooms in three categories.  A Standard Room is provided free of charge. If you choose from categories Silver and Gold, with ‚Äúbeautiful‚Äù numbers, you will have to pay a little extra. <br><br>  At the appointed time, the master comes, connects the VoIP-gateway, which receives all the settings over the network, and connects the phone.  Connection takes 10-15 minutes.  VoIP-Gateway is a small box that is available for free.  In the future, you will not need to configure this gateway or manage it.  The gateway works simply as a telephone adapter.  This option is suitable for those who do not want to give up the old phone.  Only the home number will be changed, or rather, the number in ‚ÄúOnLime‚Äù will be given a new one, the number from MGTS will remain with you on the old wire. <br><br>  The wizard connects the gateway to your router with a standard Ethernet cable, or if there is no router, then the gateway will be connected to the OnLayme wire in front of your computer.  Further, via a standard telephone cable with RJ11 connectors, any push-button or radio telephone is connected.  For this, the gateway has a corresponding port (FXS port).  Advanced models of routers, also available to OnLime subscribers, are already equipped with this port and do not require a VoIP gateway at all - this is a built-in function.  So those users who do not want to install unnecessary devices can choose such a ‚Äúpremium‚Äù Wi-Fi router (also known as a router). <br><br>  Another option is suitable for owners of IP phones - they can be connected with an Ethernet cable directly to the router.  Now in ‚ÄúOnLaym‚Äù they simplify the procedure for connecting Gigaset IP-series phones - it will become automatic, it will be enough for the user to enter an activation code (10 digits).  For now, customization templates are being used <br><br>  That's all.  After that, you can make calls in the usual way. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8da/25a/20b/8da25a20b5104a6eafa98793d5b833bf.jpg"><br>  <em>The subscriber voice gateway is designed to transmit voice and fax messages over IP networks (VoIP) and supports the SIP control protocol.</em>  <em>Using the most advanced voice compression algorithms (G.711 codec) and service quality assurance, the VoIP gateway provides high voice quality.</em> <br><br>  According to user feedback, the sound quality in the ‚ÄúHome Phone‚Äù is very good, and the volume is above normal, so those who have no hearing impairment can reduce the speaker volume to a minimum. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#91c848">Calls without a home phone?</font> </h2><br>  In addition to connecting a standard home phone, OnLaym allows you to use any of your devices ‚Äî a smartphone, tablet, laptop ‚Äî to make calls.  To do this, you need to install special software (SIP software) on the devices, and they must also be connected to the Internet "OnLime".  To do this, you do not even need to call technical specialists - the provider explains in detail how to set up mobile devices, on your website, in the <a href="http://www.onlime.ru/abonents/help_and_settings/">Help - Fixed-line phone</a> section, there are also recommended SIP telephony applications for various operating systems.  Mobile devices can be configured both instead of a regular landline phone, and with it - this will save you from having to run to the handset: the incoming call goes immediately to your connected device. <br><br>  However, it is possible to call from the ‚ÄúOnLime‚Äù number only from a specific place, that is, from an apartment - the provider is obliged to limit the field of validity of telephone communication by law.  That is, even if you use a SIP client on a smartphone, then in regular mode you can call from it only within the coverage area of ‚Äã‚Äãyour home Wi-Fi network. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#91c848">How does SIP work?</font> </h2><br>  For an outgoing call from a SIP phone or from a standard via a VoIP gateway, the request goes through the Internet to the VoIP provider.  He receives information about where you are calling and sends a request via the Internet to the local provider of the service that makes the call to the addressee.  In the case of the ‚ÄúHome Phone‚Äù ‚ÄúOnLime‚Äù, the situation is somewhat different - local calls are transmitted via the Rostelecom network, so the provider has the ability to control the quality of communication by prioritizing voice and signaling.  This distinguishes Rostelecom from IP-telephony providers that provide service on foreign networks without prioritizing traffic. <br><br>  In "OnLime" the call goes from the apartment to the telephone switch of the provider, that is, they do not leave the Internet.  As a switch, the provider uses category 5 SoftSwitch (carrier class) from Huawei.  So, if there is demand from consumers, including corporate users, the provider can configure various additional functions.  However, the wide range of functionality is not required for private subscribers and users of the SOHO segment. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#91c848">Phone or SIP client?</font> </h2><br>  Which phone to choose for "Home Phone"?  There are many possibilities - from the old analog wired device to the DECT hybrid radiotelephones.  A hybrid phone can work with both the city line and IP-telephony.  For this, it has two ports.  This option is suitable for those who do not want to give up the old phone number.  You can do and program for a computer or smartphone. <br><br>  For example, in the latest versions of Android there is a built-in SIP client.  Or you can download it from the app store.  If you have an iPhone, iPad - open the App Store, enter in the search for SIP or VoIP and choose to taste.  Now Rostelecom is developing its own special application for IP-telephony.  Such a ‚Äúcommunicator‚Äù, unlike Skype or Viber, will allow users to get a real city phone number for calls to other phone numbers.  Subscribers will be able to link their home number to the application and receive calls through it far from home, even abroad. <br><br>  But in any case, it is better to think about buying just a telephone set - a comfortable and functional one.  The task is facilitated by the presence of <a href="http://www.onlime.ru/abonents/help_and_settings/">instructions</a> for setting up phones and SIP-clients on the site "OnLime".  For lovers of doing their own hands there are <a href="http://www.onlime.ru/abonents/help_and_settings/">instructions</a> on <a href="http://www.onlime.ru/abonents/help_and_settings/">how</a> to configure routers. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9ca/cbd/a84/9cacbda8421840b794c0a126dd2f9274.jpg"></div><br>  <em>Phone Gigaset C530IP.</em>  <em>It connects the city line and the Internet.</em> <br><br><h2>  <font color="#91c848">How reliable is it?</font> </h2><br>  A twisted pair goes from the subscriber to the switch, the switches are combined with optical rings: access level, aggregation and backbone optical network DWDM. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0c7/048/a9e/0c7048a9e2114ea489f9ab2377f1284b.jpg"></div><br><br>  Thus, the entire optical network, up to the house switch, is reserved.  For any single accident in the ring, connectivity is not lost.  Only the line from the subscriber to the home switch is not reserved.  The fanless switch is closed in a vandal-resistant cabinet and can function in extreme temperature conditions.  SoftSwitch itself is reserved according to the N + 1 scheme.  And the phone will work even if the money has run out on the subscriber‚Äôs personal account, <br><br><h2>  <font color="#91c848">Let's sum up</font> </h2><br>  So, the telephone connection from OnLaym is a landline in Moscow, city, mobile, long-distance and international telephone communication at favorable rates, no fee for a subscriber line, free services (AON), call hold, call forwarding. <br><br>  Additional paid services include ‚ÄúFavorite Intercity‚Äù, ‚ÄúCall to other countries‚Äù, anti-AON, ‚ÄúZero within the network‚Äù.  The first gives you the opportunity to call phone numbers throughout Russia at a selected one or more long distance destinations at a low price.  The international call service ‚ÄúCall to other countries‚Äù allows you to make cheap calls to phone numbers in selected countries.  ‚ÄúZero within the network‚Äù means free calls to other Rostelecom subscribers throughout Russia.  Having connected, the subscriber will receive 100 free minutes of conversations.  Of course, Rostelecom offers IP telephony services not only for the home, but also <a href="https://moscow.rt.ru/b2b/fix/modern_phone/new_telephonya">for the office</a> - a virtual number and a virtual PBX.  But that's another story. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/267555/">https://habr.com/ru/post/267555/</a></p>
