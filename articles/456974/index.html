The introduction of VR technology in b2c <a href="https://blog.us.playstation.com/2019/03/25/playstation-vr-the-next-wave-of-games-coming-in-spring-and-summer-2019/">continues</a> , albeit slowly.  Manufacturers have to deal with issues of ergonomics, good resolution, lack of wires and the production of a large amount of content.  Modern VR with each <a href="https://variety.com/2019/digital/news/oculus-quest-sold-out-1203227173/">release</a> becomes closer to the image for which there is a request from a potential audience. <br><br>  In parallel, VR is actively developing in the b2b segment.  Ever since the first models of the HTC Vive and Oculus Rift, the technology has already provided opportunities for effectively solving certain business problems.  In 2016‚Äì2017, companies created prototypes that tested various hypotheses, together with contractors launched pilot projects to familiarize themselves with the technology, and analyzed how it can be applied in personnel training, marketing and communications, and other areas. <br><br><blockquote>  With the creation of new glasses models, even more possibilities of using VR in business have appeared.  This became real primarily due to standalone devices ‚Äî completely autonomous solutions that do not need a computer connection or a telephone. </blockquote><br>  In 2018, there was a trend towards the use of platform solutions in b2b.  These solutions included the development of VR projects based on ready-made modules, which also include a system for delivering and administering content on the customer‚Äôs fleet, access rights, assigning simulation tasks to employees, simulation analytics systems, and the ability to launch projects on various devices.  Projects work on both HTC Vive and Oculus Go or Vive Focus (and now also Oculus Quest and Vive Focus Plus).

      The growth of the fleet of devices that differ significantly from each other at the level of capabilities for tracking and input systems, makes it even more important to prototype and test mechanics in VR. <br><br><blockquote>  This is also true in b2c - in order to reach the maximum audience that is not very large in b2c, it is necessary to provide for project porting to the maximum number of existing systems. </blockquote><br><h2>  The importance of prototyping and testing in VR development </h2><br>  In the majority of articles on UX in VR, authors advise to start testing any hypotheses concerning displacement systems, individual mechanics of interaction with an interactive environment using controllers, script submissions and visualization as soon as possible.  We are talking about the possibility of being inside the simulation from the user's position in order to see how he perceives the created virtual reality. <br><br>  To start all the processes, you need to solve a lot of tasks: take into account numerous test iterations in development planning, provide key specialists with the necessary equipment, deliver VR devices to remote employees and organize spaces for tests in the office. <br><br>  Equipment should be provided not only to UX-designers and testers, but also to 3D-artists and programmers who check the proportions of scenes and environments, the logic of the work of various interaction systems - the actual code.  Ways to test hypotheses on VR projects <br>  There are several approaches to prototyping solutions.  They depend on the goals, objectives and capabilities of the specialist who hypothesizes. <br><br><h3>  1. Search sketches and storyboards </h3><br>  Classic sketches are effective for quickly testing ideas ‚Äî they must be done quickly, be neat and thought-provoking.  They are useful when you need to convey ideas to the team or client (although not always clients can correctly evaluate them because of inaccuracies, the difference between the sketch and the final result).  Sketches are suitable for finding common ideas on interface implementation, location in space and other similar tasks.  This is a good starting point for starting a discussion of a <a href="http://randyhuynh.com/projects/vr-environments/">possible implementation</a> . <br><br>  For the development of user scenarios in the early stages it is convenient to use a graphical script - <a href="https://virtualrealitypop.com/storyboarding-in-virtual-reality-67d3438a2fb1">storyboards</a> .  They are useful for VR in that they show how the user interacts with objects, achieves their goals, without going into details.  Describing the scene behind the scenes, we are working on the interaction scenario.  Already at the stage of storyboards you can take into account comfortable areas of visibility and accessibility for the user in order to prevent such errors at subsequent stages of the process. <br><br><h3>  2. Panoramic prototypes </h3><br>  As a rule, classic sketches remain on paper.  But when designing VR applications, it is important to see sketches in a VR headset as early as possible.  Panoramic prototypes are suitable in cases where there is not enough time to test a hypothesis and there is no opportunity to go deep into the field of software development. <br><br>  For this, 360 ¬∞ panoramas will help us - projections of spherical images onto a plane, which can be quickly viewed in a VR glasses or a 360 ¬∞ player. <br><br>  There are two common methods for projection of spherical images.  The first: a <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259A%25D1%2583%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B8%25D1%2587%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D1%2583%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0">cubic projection</a> - 6 squares of the cube faces, which are obtained by turning the camera 90 ¬∞. <br><br>  The second method is an <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%2525D0%2525A1%2525D1%252584%2525D0%2525B5%2525D1%252580%2525D0%2525B8%2525D1%252587%2525D0%2525B5%2525D1%252581%2525D0%2525BA%2525D0%2525B0%2525D1%25258F_%2525D0%2525BF%2525D0%2525B0%2525D0%2525BD%2525D0%2525BE%2525D1%252580%2525D0%2525B0%2525D0%2525BC%2525D0%2525B0">equidistant projection</a> .  It is a rectangular image with 2 to 1 aspect ratios and a specific distortion grid.  Vertical lines correspond to the angle of rotation 10 degrees vertically, curved lines 10 degrees horizontally.  Along the horizon line, the minimum distortions are obtained, from the top and bottom - maximum. <br><br>  Equivalent projection is convenient to use for sketching.  You can print it and <a href="https://medium.com/inborn-experience/vr-sketches-56599f99b357">draw with a pen</a> , in a <a href="https://medium.com/inborn-experience/easy-way-to-make-360-vr-designs-c00ee2910b22">graphic editor</a> , or in specialized programs, for example, Microsoft Sketch 360. The concept can be viewed on a computer in a 360 ¬∞ player, for example, in a GoPro VR Player.  In the browser, for example through vizor.io, or in glasses through the browser and vizor, or through any application for viewing panoramas in VR glasses. <br><br>  Panoramic prototypes do not have to be drawn by hand; 3d artists can create them with the help of three-dimensional graphics editors, which allow you to get a render in the form of a spherical panorama.  This is convenient, for example, to quickly check the position of the camera in the scene, the scale of the environment, and so on. <br><br>  A panorama-based solution is more efficient in understanding how the various interface elements or objects are located in the scene.  This can be assessed while viewing the environment in 360 format.  It is also possible to create simple animations and track the user's path by navigating between panoramas. <br><br><h3>  3. Interactive prototypes </h3><br>  Many ideas concerning interaction systems cannot be tested without significant interactivity in the prototype.  There are various ways to do this. <br><br>  Ideally, you need to be able to assemble prototypes right in the environment in which the project is created: for example, in Unity or Unreal Engine. <br><br><blockquote>  In the future, the tasks of interface designers on VR projects can expand to the extent that, when applying for a job in a studio engaged in VR development, expertise in the field of 3d modeling and content assembly in Unity will become a mandatory requirement. </blockquote><br>  There are separate services that can be used for prototyping with viewing the result in VR, for example, <a href="https://aframe.io/">A-Frame</a> , where there is a relatively small entry threshold to get started. <br><br>  How much such solutions can be useful on the project depends on the specific tasks.  Most likely, there will be other programs or extensions for existing editors and services. <br><br>  So, thanks to the creation of interactive prototypes, you can test the work of simple solutions that are mainly tied to the movement of the user's view in the virtual space.  For more serious hypotheses, using the same Unity is indispensable. <br><br>  But there are two more approaches to creating prototypes that need to be discussed. <br><br><h3>  4. Prototyping in VR </h3><br>  This is quite a logical and very understandable solution - to create prototypes for VR, while in VR.  Sketches of virtual space, elements of the environment and interface solutions can be created directly inside the virtual environment. <br>  This will help to immediately relate their scales and proportions, as well as in real time to change position relative to each other and the user. <br><br>  There are a number of projects that can provide the necessary tools for this: <br><br>  <a href="https://www.sketchbox3d.com/"><b>Sketchbox</b></a> <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4BYpRRaxA-o" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <a href="https://www.tiltbrush.com/"><b>Tilt brush</b></a> <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TckqNdrdbgk" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <a href="http://tvori.co/"><b>Tvori</b></a> <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Dm8liB5hsvI" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><h3>  5. Brownboxing </h3><br>  Brownboxing is a term that was invented by the developers of the ‚ÄúI Expect You to Die‚Äù VR game, by analogy with the ‚Äúgray box‚Äù and ‚Äúwhite box‚Äù stages in the <a href="http://level-design.ru/pro-ld-book-index/08-production-pipeline/">game level</a> design process.  Brownboxing means the creation of full-size physical prototypes of a future virtual environment.  Cardboard is used for this, hence ‚Äúbrown‚Äù in the title. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5Oq_fVol_88" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  The process looks quite ridiculous, but such a solution can be very useful in situations where there is no way to quickly implement an interactive prototype.  It is often used in projects where tasks are heavily tied to large motor skills, and if they are limited in time.  On a similar cardboard prototype, one can estimate the dimensions of the elements, see whether it is possible to reach them from the user's position in the scene, determine the time interval for which this can be done, build around this game time limits, and so on. <br><br><h2>  Total </h2><br>  Existing prototyping options cover most of the needs of different types of specialists working on VR projects.  At the initial stage, designers and artists can test their interface concepts and view the proportions of the basic geometry of three-dimensional locations in panoramas. <br><br>  Professionals with no game engine skills can use relatively simple tools for creating interactivity, for example, in A-Frame.  Someone will be comfortable checking out their ideas inside VR editors.  And many 3D artists familiar with Unity or Unreal can assemble simple interactivity in editors without connecting programmers in order to evaluate their current work on organizing scenes, the work of light and in general decisions in the field of design of virtual locations. <br><br><h2>  From the Editor </h2><br><ul><li>  online profession " <a href="https://netology.ru/programs/vr-designer">Designing VR-interfaces</a> " </li><li>  online profession " <a href="https://netology.ru/programs/vfx">Motion Design, 3D and VFX Basics</a> " </li><li>  online profession " <a href="https://netology.ru/programs/gamedesigner%3Futm_source%3Dblog%26utm_medium%3D1492%26utm_campaign%3Dbdes_gmdf_ou_habr_20062019_prototypevr">Game Designer</a> " </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/456974/">https://habr.com/ru/post/456974/</a></p>
