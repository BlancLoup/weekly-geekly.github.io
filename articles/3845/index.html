name="habracut"></a><ol><li>  I read <a href="http://gluek.info/2006/04/09/getting-things-done-gtd-na-russkom-yazyike">Getting Things Done</a> from cover to cover. <br>  I have a calendar that is always at hand. <br>  I only bring meetings and affairs related to certain dates to the calendar. <br>  I have an offline place for incoming documents that I use daily (inbox tray). <br>  I have an email client configured for my requirements. <br>  I have a voice mail box configured for my needs. <br>  I always have the opportunity to write down ideas that come to my mind in any form (notepad, PDA, voice recorder, etc.). <br>  I have an easily accessible place (or places) for storing Next Actions. <br>  I have a list of projects. <br>  I listened to GTD in audiobook format. <br>  I have a Waiting For list. <br>  I have a "borrowed / rented" list <br>  I have an inbox (inbox) for incoming / downloaded files. <br>  I have a reminder system located in a convenient and fast place to access. <br>  I have a paper storage system, convenient and with quick access, maybe with a labeling machine. <br>  My list of actions contains specific physical actions (and not multi-step projects). <br>  Every week I look through my listings. <br>  I have a ‚ÄúSomeday / Maybe‚Äù list (Someday / Maybe), and I regularly review and update this list during reviews. <br>  I have a physical workplace equipped by me. <br>  I have all the necessary stationery (p. 59). <br>  I have a mobile office, if you need one. <br>  The directory structure on my computer is configured for maximum productivity (convenience and speed of searching). <br>  I attend the weekly GTD meetings. <br>  The first 6 months of entry into the GTD system, and even then, if necessary, I keep a diary, where I write down daily progress from the use of GTD. <br>  I look at the GTD diary weekly and monthly to improve my mood and encourage further progress. <br><br>  <strong>Average level</strong> <br>  I use the GTD system continuously for the last 3-6 months. <br>  I read Getting Things Done twice or more. <br>  I used to listen to GTD in an audiobook format so often that I can recognize the voice of David Allen with absolute accuracy. <br>  I consistently bring to the end of the case "waiting." <br>  I consistently distribute and pick up things on the list "borrowed / rented" <br>  I consistently clean the inbox every day at five o'clock in the evening. <br>  I consistently clean the inbox every day at five o'clock in the evening. <br>  I consistently clear my voicemail box every day at five o'clock in the evening. <br>  I consistently clear my inbox every day. <br>  I consistently clear all ‚Äúincoming‚Äù and ‚Äúbaskets‚Äù (notepads, tape recorders, other unsorted notes) every day at five o'clock in the evening. <br>  Every week at the same time I do a mandatory review. <br>  Unassorted records are not stored anywhere except for the Inbox tray, project folders, and reference storage. <br>  I have a day in the calendar (once or twice a year) ‚Äútidy and check all papers.‚Äù <br>  I have my own model of heights (p. 126), and I check it once a quarter (of course, with a reminder in the calendar). <br>  Weekly, and even better every morning, I remind myself of my global goals for my own inspiration. <br>  Weekly I check and update the list of projects. <br>  During the day, I often review cases. <br>  I am well acquainted with the most popular GTD web and desktop tools and know their strengths and weaknesses. <br>  I picked up online and / or paper tools that best fit my system, and use them daily. <br>  When clearing the incoming, I start from the top and process the documents in order, to a logical conclusion (instead of pulling things out of the pile easier). <br>  I am well acquainted with <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259A%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D1%2582%25D1%258B_%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BC%25D1%258F%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8">mental maps</a> , and use them as needed. <br>  I know by heart the five phases of project planning (p. 38) and use them all the time. <br>  I know by heart the triple model for evaluating daily work (p. 123) and use it constantly. <br>  I know by heart the four-critique decision-making model (p. 120) and act according to it, or I have something better. <br>  I experimented with GTDGmail, or with another program for managing mail, and picked the most suitable one for myself. <br><br>  <strong>Advanced level</strong> <br>  I have been using GTD for the past 6 months every day. <br>  I subscribed to <a href="http://davidco.com/connect/">GTD Connect</a> , and I listen to most of the stuff from there. <br>  I listen to the <a href="http://odeo.com/show/3351643/view">43 Folders</a> podcasts by David Allen. <br>  I helped three people successfully introduce GTD into their lives. <br>  I read David Allen‚Äôs book ‚ÄúReady for Anything‚Äù and other personal time management books. <br>  I work, being in a state of flow, from a quarter to half of all time. <br>  I do not remember anything that can be stored in the system, and throughout the day I constantly bring ideas, actions and projects into GTD. <br>  I read Getting Things Done at least twice, added a bunch of bookmarks and wrote almost every page with my thoughts. <br>  I always call back within 24 hours if necessary, usually within 2-12 hours, without forgetting. <br>  I respond to all incoming mail within 24 hours (usually much faster), without loss and forgetting. <br>  When I put something in the inbox, I'm completely sure that I will do it ... or I know why I will not do it, and I am calm about it. <br>  When I agree to do something for another, I‚Äôm completely sure that I will do it ... or tell him immediately why I cannot do it. <br>  I do not feel worried about all my affairs. <br>  My mind is like water, calm and transparent, and I never try to make any decision twice. <br>  My paper repository is always relevant. <br>  My affairs are better organized than everyone I know (except for the GTD masters!). <br>  I never miss an action on a project or task. <br>  I don't remember anything lately that would break my system. <br>  I am surprised at the people who are missing the pitch because I cannot understand their perspectives. <br>  I constantly consult with someone who has been using GTD for at least 4 years. <br>  I am well aware of the strengths and weaknesses of GTD because I read and studied other systems of productivity and time management. <br>  I act on the system automatically, without coercion and reminders. <br>  I can easily track how my daily work is related to goals at other heights. <br>  I am so productive and my mind is so pure that new ideas appear constantly ... and I always have a way to fix them. <br>  I easily say ‚ÄúNo‚Äù, because I always know what I have to do and how important it is.

      <strong>Craftsmanship</strong> <br>  I have been using GTD for the past 12 months every day. <br>  My system is absolutely transparent for 6 months. <br>  My system went through several stages of evolution with a change of tools, fully penetrating into my life. <br>  I helped 10 people successfully introduce GTD into their lives, and they have been using this system for 6 months already. <br>  I easily come to all meetings in 10 minutes, perfectly prepared and with a clean peaceful mind. <br>  When I work, I'm in the flow. <br>  I do not use encouraging means (coffee, sugar) - my work stimulates me. <br>  I try not to work with people who are late or break promises only if it is not absolutely necessary or is it my GTD student. <br>  I am known as a little promising and doing a lot. <br>  I regularly do physical exercises that increase health, strength, breathing, flexibility, and general form. <br>  I wake up early in the morning at the same time on the alarm clock and immediately join the GTD stream, with relaxed attention. <br>  I do regular spiritual practices listed in the calendar, which I constantly follow. <br>  I have a list of books on personal / spiritual / career growth, which I constantly read, possibly allocating constant time for this. <br>  I constantly try new tools to improve performance, but only if it is really necessary. <br>  When I finish something, it is done as well as possible, regardless of the complexity and number of intermediate steps. <br>  Planning and creating mental maps is as natural to me as breathing. <br>  I commissioned or automated many regular tasks, getting rid of the routine. <br>  I am surrounded by the same productive people as myself. <br>  I have several teachers who help me to increase my productivity, and with whom I meet regularly. <br>  My housing is like a Zen temple - everything is taken into account, everything is conscious and purposeful. <br>  My workplace contributes to peace - people often say how nice and calm they are to sit at my desk. <br>  If I wanted to, I could easily engage in personal productivity training - people often ask my advice in this area. <br>  I can write a book on personal productivity ... or have already done so. <br>  I reach my goals faster and easier than I expected. <br>  Work - and life - is a thrill, bliss, a game. <br><br>  Page numbers are listed for <a href="http://gluek.info/2006/04/09/getting-things-done-gtd-na-russkom-yazyike">book translation</a> . <br><br>  <a href="http://gtdmastery100.com/">Original article</a> . </li></ol></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/3845/">https://habr.com/ru/post/3845/</a></p>
