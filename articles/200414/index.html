      Content Management System (CMS) allows you to manage the publication of various resources on the websites of public authorities <br><br>  The system is implemented on the Microsoft Windows Azure platform and is highly scalable, affordable, and fault tolerant. <br><br>  The system allows you to manage website content at the level of 4 main types of resources - documents, services (online services for the public), data and multimedia. <br><br>  The system is implemented as a web application with an interface that allows you to easily and visually manage various types of resources. <br><br>  When working with documents, the system supports the following functionality: <br><br><ul><li>  Document publishing </li><li>  Creating and editing a document card (metadata) </li><li>  Search for related documents and other types of resources </li><li>  Control of publication (workflow) </li></ul><br>  When working with multimedia data, the system supports the following functionality: <br><br><ul><li>  Publication of multimedia data (photo, audio, video) </li><li>  Creating and editing metadata </li><li>  Placing video in Azure Media Services - streaming, quality optimization, depending on the characteristics of communication channels </li><li>  Search for related documents and other types of resources </li><li>  Control of publication (workflow) </li></ul><br>  When working with data, the system supports the following functionality: <br><br><ul><li>  Data loading </li><li>  Visual presentation of data </li><li>  Data publication </li><li>  Providing access to data </li><li>  Search for related documents and other types of resources </li><li>  Control of publication (workflow) </li></ul><br>  When working with services, the system supports the following functionality: <br><br><ul><li>  Placing services in Windows Azure </li><li>  Publishing a web interface to the service </li><li>  Publishing Software Service Access (API) </li><li>  Creating and editing the service description </li><li>  Search for related documents and other types of resources </li></ul><br>  The system supports the ability to collect and analyze data related to the use of resources published with its help. <br><br><ul><li>  Number of hits </li><li>  Number of downloads </li><li>  Number of views </li><li>  Technical data about users (type of browser, type of abundant device) </li></ul><br>  Technical implementation of the system <br><br><ul><li>  Services and data are available through program interfaces (API) </li><li>  Services - hosting (web / worker role) </li><li>  Data - Storage / Access, BLOB Storage </li><li>  Documents and multimedia are accessible via the web interface. </li><li>  Documents - CMS, SQL DB </li><li>  Multimedia - Azure Media Services, BLOB Storage </li></ul><br><h3>  Platform for publishing open data </h3><br>  Solution ‚ÄúPlatform for publication of open data‚Äù is a content management system (CMS, Content Management System) for open data <br><br>  The solution is intended for IT departments of city administrations. <br><br>  The solution can be used to load, visualize, publish and provide access to open data. <br><br>  The solution is implemented on the Microsoft Windows Azure platform and is highly scalable, affordable, and fault tolerant. <br><br>  In general, the process of publishing open data consists of the following steps: <br><br><ul><li>  Data loading </li><li>  Data presentation </li><li>  Data publication </li><li>  Providing access to data </li></ul><br>  Before the data is directly downloaded by the data owner <br><br><ul><li>  Data set definition </li><li>  Data cleansing </li><li>  Preparing data for loading </li><li>  Converting data to one or more formats supported by the platform </li><li>  Loading, displaying data in a tabular form for preview </li><li>  Ability to delete downloaded data - in cases where additional cleaning, transformation, etc. </li><li>  Metadata task ‚Äî description of the loaded data set, filling in additional fields ‚Äî category, type, update frequency, etc. </li></ul><br>  The visual presentation of the data is used in the publication process as a visual tool for checking the correctness of the loaded data and as a means for selecting one of several possible data representations. <br><br>  In the process of data consumption, visualization is used to visually familiarize with the data, to obtain summary information, to find aggregated data and their representations for publication on websites. <br><br>  The system supports the following options for visual presentation: <br><br><ul><li>  Charts </li><li>  Mapping (with automatic creation of KML files) </li><li>  Widgets (for publishing on websites) </li><li>  Elements of infographics </li></ul><br>  Data publishing completes the data cycle and makes it available for consumption.  After publication, data is available in the following views: <br><br><ul><li>  Machine Readable (CSV) </li><li>  Tabular </li><li>  Cartographic </li><li>  The visual </li></ul><br>  <em>Note</em>  The system supports automatic creation of meta tags for SEO. <br><br>  Upon completion of the publication of data, a report is created, which specifies such parameters as the name and amount of published data, metadata, date and time of publication, the author of the publication, options for accessing the data, ways of their visualization, etc.  - such a report may, for example, be published on the website to inform potential users of this data set. <br><br>  Data access is implemented in the form of "layers".  Each layer represents the data in a predefined form: <br><br><ul><li>  "Lower layer" - data in machine-readable and / or table view </li><li>  "Middle layer" - data, in the form of a set of graphical representations </li><li>  ‚ÄúTop layer‚Äù - data presented in the form of aggregates, widgets, infographic elements - i.e.  in statistically processed form </li></ul><br>  It is assumed that the transition from between layers will be supported - i.e.  users will be able to go from the top to the bottom level, thus revealing the data sets in their entirety. <br><br>  Platform Usage Examples <br><br><ul><li>  Integration with city services </li></ul><br>  Platform as a provider and consumer of data from online urban services <br><br><ul><li>  Single portal of the city </li></ul><br>  Platform as an interface to the city‚Äôs single portal <br><br><ul><li>  Publish infographics </li></ul><br>  Platform as a means of creating and publishing infographics <br><br>  Possible platform extensions <br><br><ul><li>  Ability to automatically generate programmatic interfaces (APIs) to provide online data access </li><li>  The means of collecting data created by the population (crowd-sourcing).  By analogy with open311 </li><li>  Example: urban transport work </li><li>  Example: work online city services </li><li>  Use of mixed data (open data from other sources) </li><li>  Example: city-level data + region-level data </li></ul><br>  The system supports the collection of the following data about its use: <br><br><ul><li>  Number of visits </li><li>  Most Popular Data Sets </li><li>  Most Popular Data Views </li></ul><br><h3>  About Aplana </h3><br>  The company ‚ÄúAplana‚Äù specializes in the development, testing and maintenance of software created in accordance with the specific requirements of customers and provides services for the implementation and integration of applications for corporate clients in the Russian and foreign markets.
