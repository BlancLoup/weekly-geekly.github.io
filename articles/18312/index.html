  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Once upon a time Ignat ‚Ñ¢ Hyak ‚Ñ¢ ||| 0.1</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Ignat was born and lived in the international high-tech community for 25 years.  Most recently, he visited the Old Museum and was horrified by what he saw ... Old technologies, printing presses, Zingers, Optimus ... <a name="habracut"></a>  in his age, signs and symbols were transmitted through emotions.  Emotions were capable of not using voice, hearing, sight, organs of touch to transfer trillions of bits in sunda‚Äôs shares to any number of people, to any distances.  Spaming flourished, but those caught or used by this technology were punished with unprecedented cruelty: they were deprived of the possibility of wireless non-contact communication, and they had to open their mouth to utter a word.  The uniqueness of participants in active text, sound, and visual exchanges sometimes did not open their mouths for years, some were hibernating and euphoric suspended animation.  There were also such Individuals who had long since fallen asleep ... and the Sinister from the SUP wrote bots instead.  They say it was in the distant era of the iphone.  At that time, Windows Vista dominated, and Mac OS represented only 5% of users, Linux and * nix, with the active support of Ubuntaria being only 27%.  Now, when thinking-intuitive processes dominated, the FreeBSD phrases controlled only by the Abuse future team symbolize only the unsuccessful utopian call of freedom, the cry to the barbarian jungle of wars. <br><br>  Ignat lived quietly and did not try to penetrate into what he was not interested.  His zBOOK PRO updated and downloaded all term updates and were very smart, his iCommuncate Responsibility, developed a week ago and already implemented in use in just a few communes, unlocked by local craftsmen, allowed me to work wonders, download movies and podcasts, photo and audio content without limiting the volume limit and speed, as well as quantities, and he could also write in Russian and English, while Android was generally accepted only in Chinese.  Ignat would live happily ever after, instead of enjoying the new cyber anime, he bargained for the old volume of Pushkin's fairy tales on Sahara update.  Podcasts would be nothing more, it is clear more or less, but the tales were new. </div>
