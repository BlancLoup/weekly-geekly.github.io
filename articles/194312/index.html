It sounds like a joke, but it is not.  TIME has <a href="http://techland.time.com/2013/09/18/google-vs-death/">published the</a> full story of a new Google startup that will try to figure out how to deal with aging. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/8b2/795/81f/8b279581f5e02ae734a8f87150e99b93.png"><br><br>  The bottom line is this: <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  At the moment, Google is preparing the most uncertain and long-term maneuver.  The company plans to launch Calico, a new company that will focus on health and aging issues in particular.  The independent company will be managed by Arthur Levinson, the former CEO of biotechnology company Genentech, who will also be an investor.  Levinson, who began his career as a scientist and holds a doctorate in biochemistry, plans to remain in his current role as chairman of Genentech and Apple (a position he assumed after the death of Steve Jobs in 2011).  Google is preparing to make a serious attempt to increase the lifespan of a person.

      Google‚Äôs CEO Larry Page wrote: ‚ÄúWell ... you probably think - wow!  This is very different from what Google is doing today.  And you are right.  But, as we explained in our first letter to shareholders, there is a huge potential of technology for improving people's lives.  So do not be surprised if we invest in projects that seem strange or speculative compared to our existing Internet business.  And please remember that new investments, like Calico, are very small compared to our core business. ‚Äù <br><br>  So, how is Calico going to achieve an increase in the length of our lives, and perhaps eventually heal death?  Page did not publish any particular plan.  On Google+, he says: ‚ÄúToo little time has passed to share something.  Of course, when Arthur has something to say, he will definitely share it. ‚Äù  This is an extraordinary project, but this is what Paige loves.  He wants to solve large-scale problems.  This is why Google is developing self-driving cars and balloons floating in the air with Internet connections.  Google, whose money chickens do not peck, and endless ambitions, sees itself as the only company ready to take on big risks like these.  ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt propose to spend all our money on controversial things, but we have to spend a commensurate amount so that regular companies spend on research and development and spend it on things that are a little more long-term and a little more ambitious than usual‚Äù, says Larry. <br><br>  Here is the full text of the <a href="http://googlepress.blogspot.com/2013/09/calico-announcement.html">press release</a> : <br><br>  Mountain View, California - September 18, 2013 - Google today announced Calico, a new company whose work will focus on health and well-being, in particular, the problem of aging and related diseases.  Arthur Levinson, chairman and former CEO of Genentech and chairman of Apple, will be the CEO and one of the project‚Äôs founders. <br><br>  Announcing this new investment, Larry Page, Google CEO, said: ‚ÄúDisease and aging affect all of our families.  In the long term, thinking more broadly and progressively about health care and biotechnology, I believe we can improve the lives of millions of people.  It is impossible to imagine a person better than Arthur - one of the leading scientists, entrepreneurs and leaders of our generation - who takes the reins of government for a new project. ‚Äù  Arthur said: ‚ÄúI have devoted most of my life to science and technology in order to improve human health.  Larry's focus on incredible improvements has inspired me, and I am extremely happy and waiting for what happens next. ‚Äù <br><br>  Arthur Levinson will remain chairman of Genentech and director of Hoffmann-La Roche, as well as chairman of Apple. <br><br>  Commenting on Arthur‚Äôs new position, Franz Humer, chairman of Hoffmann-La Roche, said: ‚ÄúArthur‚Äôs track record at Genentech was exemplary, and we see interesting opportunities for our companies to work together in the future.  We are pleased that he will stay with us. " <br><br>  Tim Cook, Apple CEO, said: ‚ÄúThe lives of many of our friends and families were interrupted too soon, or their quality of life too often left much to be desired.  Arthur is one of those crazy people who think that it‚Äôs not at all necessary that it always is.  There is no one more suitable for this mission and I look forward to seeing the results. ‚Äù <br><br>  <i>The original was published on September 18, 2013 on <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/google-is-launching-a-company-that-hopes-to-cure-death-2013-9">Business Insider</a> , by Jay Yarow.</i> <br><br>  PS No details about the technology and research of Google yet reveal, but there is an assumption that Calico would rather search for the root of the problem of aging, using Google‚Äôs analytic capabilities, than develop some kind of magic pill. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/194312/">https://habr.com/ru/post/194312/</a></p>
