Just like that, with nothing to do, and just to see the result and the responses of the rest.  I must say, I did not ask for a million dollars, a cool car or another branded phone, why?  After all, is this all you can buy in real life? <br><br>  Here, perhaps, I'll start my letter? <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Yes, this desire will not be fulfilled, because I am not the only one, and my family is not the only one in the Urals or even in the country.  You know, I never thought about it before, apparently I have not yet encountered such a problem. <br>  I always thought that I would graduate from the university, find my favorite job, and I could think about my family.  And so it happened, the most important event took place under the magic numbers 789 (August 7, 2009), we got married. <br>  Favorite person near, near parents, friends, what else would you like ???  Of course, I want a full-fledged family, in the role of: mom, dad and baby.  But I do not want to run to rent someone else's housing. <br>  After analyzing the market, we came to the conclusion that we do not fall under any mortgage program.  We simply don‚Äôt have a down payment (for example, 20-30%), and even if we do, we cannot survive, pay monthly mails and 70-80% of our budget.  So what does the state call us for?  To bear children in order to get at least some capital for the second child, so that later this money could be invested in an apartment.  But then how to live, now we have young families, if we ourselves can not pay the size of the mortgage lending? <br>  And my most intimate desire is that young families do not encounter such problems, because if you look really - housing in a mortgage is not available, and not as screaming advertising says!  I want every family to be happy, because the main problem of many, the majority is the housing problem.

      Let's think a little about how to be a young family, for example, if parents can't help with anything (in my case, my parents are retired, they live in a provincial small town, my husband's parents live there, but they themselves have an apartment in a mortgage).  My husband and I live in one of the million-plus cities, we get a decent salary, in principle, enough for life (to pay for housing, get dressed, go to the cinema and in a cafe - of course not often, but everything happens), then you cannot complain about life, and do not complain. <br>  After the wedding, we began to look after apartments in the city in which we now live.  Of course, housing prices, in particular, on the secondary market have fallen, nothing can be said, even, perhaps, to some extent, you will be happy for it, but the percentage of mortgages has increased, and much more, and what conditions to help young families?  Give birth to children ???  And how to bring them up, contain finally?  Huddle in a rented apartment, this is while we both work, and then if I go on maternity leave, what then ???  Even if I honestly begin to doubt whether we can then rent the same apartment in which we live.  And this is the help of such a state?  Give birth and we will help you.  We dive into psychology a bit, and no one thought about it, the wife is home alone with the child, the husband grinds at work, earns money somewhere, but all this money is barely enough to be interrupted and even live in a rented apartment, I'm not talking about mortgages because simply not to pull it.  And then what?  Husband is a nervous person who comes home, a wife who is simply already exhausted from constant worries and depressions that they cannot give the best to the child and do not you think that many families are simply falling apart because of this?  For many young families, the main problem is the solution of the housing issue. <br>  Of course, there are different cases, someone is really lucky.  A work colleague recently told how they and a friend (they are not married yet) fouled up the apartment, or rather they did not, the parents helped.  The father of a friend of my colleague works in a construction company.  The company gives him a half million without interest for a period of 5 years.  My colleague happily declares that the same company allocates an apartment to them at cost, as a result, they acquire a one-room apartment in a new house 3-4 times cheaper than it is on the market.  And they successfully divide all these payments between the whole family. <br>  After telling this story to their parents, they would gladly help me, in the same way, pay for the ‚Äúdream‚Äù of any family, but, alas, unfortunately, we do not have a good boss who can be so generous. <br>  I think it makes no sense to talk about the ‚ÄúYoung Family‚Äù program, not many people fall under this program, it is those who need housing, roughly speaking, if 5 people are registered in a one-room apartment, then this family needs to expand its living space.  And what to do to us, mere mortals who huddle, then in rented apartments, then perekantovyvayutsya at parents?  For some reason I cannot find an answer to this question. <br>  Even yesterday, returning home to rented accommodation, we started talking again about our dream and came to the conclusion that there is no help from the state for us young, even as you shout, the mortgage is available to everyone, but we don‚Äôt see.  It turns out, or we both work, buying an apartment and paying THIS MORTGAGE for 20 years without giving birth to children (sorry, but after 20 years we will be 45 years old, what children?), Only HE and I, or just sit and wait the apartment will be inherited ....  But this is nonsense ...  God bless our parents and grandmothers health ... Of course, many of you may say, take an apartment, then you will inherit housing and you can sell it to pay off your mortgage ... But, excuse me, I don‚Äôt think it will be sacrilege for our loved ones? <br>  How to be young families that are already more or less firmly on their feet, happy in marriage, to take a mortgage of 16% for 25 years at a terrible price?  No one will answer my questions, but you know, God forbid, gentlemen officials, be in a similar situation.  When you grab at everything to keep the love and warmth of your loved ones, to find peace and happiness in your family ............. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/77180/">https://habr.com/ru/post/77180/</a></p>
