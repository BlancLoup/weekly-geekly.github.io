  <section class="page js-page"><h1>OCEJPAD 6 Preparation</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I want to share the experience of passing the <a href="http://education.oracle.com/pls/web_prod-plq-dad/db_pages.getpage%3Fpage_id%3D5001%26get_params%3Dp_exam_id:1Z0-898%26p_org_id%3D%26lang%3D">Java EE 6 Java Persistence API Developer Certified Expert Exam (OCEJPAD 6)</a> . <br><br><h4>  A little about OCEJPAD 6 </h4><br>  OCEJPAD 6 is one of the new (relatively new) certificates that covers the Java Persistence API.  Previously, the Java Persistence API was part of the SCBCD, but with the addition of the Criteria API in JPA 2.0, 2 exams were created instead of one: <br><ul><li>  Java EE 6 Java Persistence API Developer Certified Expert Exam 1Z0-898 ‚Äã‚Äã(EE6 JPA or OCEJPAD 6) </li><li>  Java EE 6 Enterprise JavaBeans Developer Certified Expert Exam 1Z0-895 (EE6 EJB or OCEEJB 6) </li></ul><br>  Who is this certificate for?  In my opinion, for all Java developers, as a rare project does without using access to databases, but to use only JDBC for a long time not for Feng Shui.  So a strong knowledge of JPA will be most welcome.  One of the most commonly used implementations of JPA is Hibernate. <br><br><h4>  Where to get mock tests? </h4><br>  The only existing mock tests for this certification (in any case known to me) are epractizelabs, but they are paid, and they say they contain many errors.  I can not say anything about this resource, because I did not use them. <br>  But, since just reading the book is quite difficult to prepare for the exam, I compiled for myself questions / answers containing all the important points from the book Pro JPA 2: Mastering the Java ‚Ñ¢ Persistence API.  Responding to them, I prepared well enough for certification - I passed with 87%.  These questions / answers are posted here - <a href="http://www.examclouds.com/">http://www.examclouds.com/</a> for free use.

    <h4>  What to read? </h4><br>  I used the Pro JPA 2 book: Mastering the Java ‚Ñ¢ Persistence API (you can download it for free on the Internet), as well as the JPA 2.0 specification, for preparation.  In my opinion, the specification should be read after a thorough study of Pro JPA 2: Mastering the Java ‚Ñ¢ Persistence API or asking for clarification of the most incomprehensible moments.  The following chapters from this book contain all the necessary information for the exam (you can safely skip everything else): <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h6>  Chapter 3. Enterprise Applications </h6>  The chapter is dedicated to EJB 3.1 - session beans, message driven beans, transactions, dependency management.  I had no questions related to message driven beans at the exam. <br><br><h6>  Chapter 4. Object-Relational Mapping </h6>  Basics of JPA.  You need to know this even if you are not going to take the exam. <br><br><h6>  Chapter 5. Collection Mapping </h6>  The chapter is about Relationships and Element Collections.  The hardest part is mapping by different values ‚Äã‚Äã(basic types, entity attributes, embeddable type, etc.).  But be prepared - a lot of questions on this topic. <br><br><h6>  Chapter 6  Entity manager </h6>  Entity manager's types and their interaction with entities.  As well as persistence contexts and transactions. <br><br><h6>  Chapter7.  Using queries </h6>  Acquaintance with JPQL, their interaction with entities.  Query and TypedQuery interfaces, parameter binding. <br><br><h6>  Chapter 8. Query Language </h6>  More detailed description of JPQL. <br><br><h6>  Chapter 9. Criteria API </h6>  An alternative way to build queries.  Quite an unusual way, for all accustomed to the usual SQL.  The exam contains many questions on the knowledge of the Criteria API. <br><br><h6>  Chapter 10. Advanced Object-Relational Mapping </h6>  More advanced use of embedded objects, ompound primary keys, and derived identifiers.  And also inheritance. <br><br><h6>  Chapter 11. Advanced Topics </h6>  This chapter contains SQL Queris, lifecycle callbacks, validation, locking, concurrency, caching, and PersistenceUtil and PersistenceUnitUtil.  Validation is not included in the certification, and I also did not have a single issue with PersistenceUtil and PersistenceUnitUtil. <br><br><h6>  Chapter 12. XML Mapping Files </h6>  Description of the XML Mapping Files, which were used instead of more convenient annotations before the release of Java SE 5. To be honest, I missed this chapter, since  In the description of the exam on the Oracle site, the topic is not specified.  But I had questions on this topic.  So I advise everyone to pay attention to her. <br><br><h4>  And a few words about SCJP (OCJP) </h4><br>  I didn‚Äôt want to repeat myself and talk again about SCJP, since the post is about Java EE 6 Java Persistence certification.  But since I get a lot of questions about her beloved, I‚Äôll still get distracted and say a few words. <br><br><h4>  What to read? </h4><br>  SCJP Sun Certified Programmer for Java 6 Exam 310-065.  The book was created specifically to prepare for the SCJP certification (it can be downloaded for free on the internet).  Each chapter contains examples of mock tests that are very, very similar to those that will be at the time of the exam.  So you can not look for anything else - it is enough for preparation. <br><br><h4>  Where to get mock tests? </h4><br>  In principle, the mock tests from the book may be enough wave, but it all depends on your preparation.  Therefore, if the soul requires more, then look at coderanch.com - there is a large list of free tests.  Not all questions from them are designed in the spirit of the SCJP exam, but they are quite suitable for preparing for the SCJP (I passed them all).  I see no reason to spend money on paid tests. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/157579/">https://habr.com/ru/post/157579/</a></p>
