  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Where in Russia are taught computational linguistics?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  It will not be about single courses devoted to this interesting science, but about how a specialist, who already has a degree in mathematics or another technical faculty, can receive a full-fledged education related to computer linguistics.  The easiest way is to enroll in a specialized magistracy.  But it only seems simple, because such a magistracy still needs to be found.  Having spent some time studying the problem, I managed to choose several options.  I want to share my discoveries with respected habrovchanami.  I think it will be interesting especially for future bachelors and specialists who are thinking about the problem ‚Äúwhere to go to study further?‚Äù. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  However, people for whom study has long been completed may think about getting a master‚Äôs degree, as you know, you can enter a magistracy a few years after graduation. <br><br>  So, computational linguistics is a young, but very promising science.  And the main feature of this science is that it is considered interdisciplinary, that is, it studies the problems at the interface of programming and linguistics.  And in order to become a full-fledged expert in this field, you need to be well versed in mathematics and linguistics. <br><br>  Training programs are divided into programs for philologists who want to link their lives with linguistic developments in IT, and for mathematicians who want to work on text recognition systems, translation programs, etc.  We will focus on the second option.

      I just want to make a reservation that there are only a few such magistracies in Russia, and they are usually supervised by companies engaged in linguistic development.  Most computational linguistics programs are located in capitals. <br><br>  I will start with the magistracy, which seemed to me the most interesting.  It is located in St. Petersburg, on the basis of St. Petersburg State University in the department of information systems in art and the humanities.  I want to immediately note that the department is located at the Faculty of Humanities, but it is designed specifically for programmers.  The educational program is called ‚ÄúHumanities Engineering‚Äù.  Target installation of a magistracy - (I quote the site) "training of specialists who are able to participate in research and design work in the field of intelligent information technologies with a specialization in the direction of language engineering, technologies for extracting humanitarian knowledge from textual flow, ontological engineering." <br><br>  To enter there, you need to pass a written test, which will be questions on mathematics, the basics of programming and (a little bit) on linguistics.  Mathematicians should not be afraid of questions on the last discipline: judging by the list of references, two or three simple books entitled ‚ÄúIntroduction to Linguistics‚Äù will be enough to pass the entrance examinations.  From my own sources, I learned that Yandex is in charge of this educational program, although the truth is not mentioned on the website of the magistracy. <br><br>  The second magistracy, which I would like to talk about, is located in Moscow at the Department of Image Recognition and Text Processing of the Faculty of Innovations and High Technologies (FIVT) at MIPT.  It was founded in 2006 by ABBYY.  Judging by the description, from several graduate programs offered by this department, the areas of "Intellectual systems" and "Methods of machine learning" most of all belong to computational linguistics.  To get there to study, you need not only to pass the entrance exam, but also to pass an interview with ABBYY employees.  Still, ABBYY expects that then graduates will go to work for them. <br><br>  And the last master's program, about which I will tell, is called ‚ÄúComputational Linguistics‚Äù and is located at the Faculty of Philology of HSE.  As follows from the information I obtained, it is in Moscow and in the Nizhny Novgorod branch of the HSE.  University representatives believe that this program is suitable not only for mathematicians, but also for graduates with a different basic education.  Training implies both programming courses designed to bring up graduates of humanitarian specialties, and a general linguistics course designed for mathematicians. <br><br>  To enroll in this magistracy, you need to pass an examination in a foreign language and arrange a portfolio in which there should be a letter of motivation and information about the future student.  It will be necessary to talk about their professional interests, publications, practices that took place, etc.  The teachers will be employees of the Faculty of Philology, the university-wide department of higher mathematics, the department of applied mathematics and computer science, the basic department of Yandex. <br><br>  In general, the choice of graduates who decide to engage in computer linguistics, there is.  So far it is small, but I think in the future there will be more such programs. <br><br>  I think this is the end of my review. <br>  For assistance in preparing the article, I thank Yandex and Google, the official website of ABBYY, as well as the websites of universities, which were discussed in a post. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/142020/">https://habr.com/ru/post/142020/</a></p>
