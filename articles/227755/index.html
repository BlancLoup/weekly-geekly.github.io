  <section class="page js-page"><h1>4 myths about landing page</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Much has already been said about the effectiveness of such an online marketing tool such as the landing page, (or landing / landing page).  At the same time, many customers still believe in the myths about the magic landings. <br><br>  These myths, if not dispelled in a timely manner, can negate the full benefits of the landing pages and cause deep disappointment among customers.  The executor from such cooperation can also remain in a financial and psychological minus. <br><br>  In our work, we are constantly confronted with such myths.  Best of all, at the very beginning of cooperation, these myths are worked out in such a way that customers have a more realistic attitude towards the development of landing pages.

      When working out objections, it would be appropriate to talk about a few successful solutions that you have already used, to show live examples of effective landing pages.  Using these examples, briefly walk through the main elements of the landing page, explain how the project will work.  If you cannot convince, it is better not to work with such clients. <br><br><h4>  Myth number 1 "Landing - a magical tool to increase sales" </h4><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d49/bb0/d65/d49bb0d653cad7792feecc457330cc88.jpg" alt="image"><a name="habracut"></a><br><habracut><br>  The landing page is not a magic tablet that can miraculously solve all sales problems.  First of all, the use value of a product or service is important.  Landing is just a beautiful showcase for presenting a service or product to consumers. <br><br>  You also need to understand that without the stages of testing, analysis and subsequent improvements it is difficult to make an effective landing page.  In addition, the landing page is just one of the tools of internet marketing.  Yes, with proper development and subsequent advertising, this tool can show high conversion rates, but you should not rely only on it. <br><br>  For example, it is almost impossible to launch a landing page without proper development of contextual or banner advertising.  To promote some services and products, internal pages of the site or social networks, etc. are more suitable. Using several tools in the complex will allow you to get an additional effect from promotion. <br><br><h4>  Myth number 2 ‚ÄúYou can quickly and cheaply make effective landing on the service generators of landing pages‚Äù </h4><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/692/779/e3d/692779e3dd692f6d0a4f9d223dac3eff.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The generators of landing pages, in my opinion, a good tool that has its advantages.  But this tool must also be able to use.  You need to understand Internet marketing, know the basics of copywriting, be ‚Äúon you‚Äù with contextual advertising. <br><br>  Generators can serve as one of the tools for Internet marketing professionals to simplify and speed up the process of developing and testing a large number of landing pages. <br><br>  Many want quick results with minimal cost.  What is the result?  That's right, low conversion rates and disappointment. <br><br><h4>  Myth number 3 ‚ÄúEnough to make a landing once and then constantly enjoy high sales‚Äù </h4><br><br><img src="http://upweek.ru/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Sales-Rising-Graphic.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Perhaps the most common misconception.  Some customers want to save money and make only one page, and at the same time they expect that applications and calls will immediately fall down like a horn of plenty.  Unfortunately, this is rarely the case. <br><br>  The effective version of the landing page is often the result of several tests of both the pages and the various elements (title, call to action, request form, etc.).  In practice, with the launch of a new Landing, work is just beginning.  The statistics of visits, requests, filling in feedback forms, etc. are collected and analyzed. <br><br>  Therefore, it is important that the customer knows about the possible potential costs of analyzing, refining and testing landing pages. <br><br><h4>  Myth number 4 "Enough to pass one training to make cool landings on their own" </h4><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9d1/bd9/c3f/9d1bd9c3f7b1e51e9a5196a27ecb4393.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The aggressive advertising of such trainings, unfortunately, has done its job.  Many entrepreneurs, especially from small businesses, took these courses and began to consider themselves experts in the development of the landing page. <br><br>  As a result, the Internet is massively filled with template landings, which are made independently or ordered from freelancers.  These landings are stamped like a carbon copy.  Often, such landing pages are ill-conceived and carelessly executed in terms of marketing, design, and layout.  This is very annoying to users and reduces trust in landing pages. <br>  How, after this, to be surprised at low conversion rates? <br><br><h4>  Findings: </h4><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9dc/922/e4e/9dc922e4eddb992f650c60dbfa829248.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Landing page is an effective internet marketing tool, but only in capable and experienced hands. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ The novelty effect of the landing page has already passed.  There will be no quick and cheap solutions. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ An effective landing page is usually obtained as a result of the work of a team of several good specialists (project manager, copywriter, designer, designer, layout designer, analyst) <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ The landing page should be part of an internet marketing program. </habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/227755/">https://habr.com/ru/post/227755/</a></p>
