One of the most important tasks of a business is to reveal the skills and talents of its employees. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  New approach to working with people </h5><br>  Notamedia became the first Russian Internet agency that systematically approached the training of its people.  Together with RIK, they developed a semiannual course program for managers and analysts adapted to their needs.  For six months, RIK specialists regularly conducted classes in the Notes office.

      It was based on the program ‚Äú <a href="http://kursrik.ru/pm">Project Management</a> ‚Äù, the most popular course of RIC.  It collected a decade of experience of the best agencies in Russia.  Its program includes everything that an Internet project manager needs to know: from time management and presentation skills to management skills of a team of creative people. <br><br><h5>  Who are Notamedia? </h5><br>  Notamedia has been creating, promoting and supporting media projects in a digital environment for more than 9 years: social networks, news, information, corporate portals.  Customers include leading media outlets, government agencies, and large corporations. <br><br>  Quality design is another strength of the agency: logos, corporate identity and other brand components created by Notamedia annually take prizes in international competitions. <br><br><h5>  Course Structure </h5><br>  On the part of the agency, 7 managers and 5 analysts completed the course, including the head of the analytics and design department.  To increase the effectiveness of training and the involvement of participants, all homework and game practices were conducted on the basis of real projects of the Note. <br><br>  At the end of the course, a certification was carried out, which made it possible to assess the qualifications of employees and understand in which direction they should be developed further.  In addition, in the process of learning and in discussions, answers to questions about the reorganization of the company were born, and very soon, Nota will reach a new level. <br><br><h5>  Reviews </h5><br>  This is what Notamedia CEO Sergey Oseledko said in the last coaching: ‚ÄúCurrent qualifications and a solid team are the main components of success and survival in our market.  And real teambuilding is possible only in the process of joint achievement of goals.  We have been doing this for half a year.  It is never too late to learn, once again we have seen what we want for you. ‚Äù <br><br><h5>  What is RIC? </h5><br>  The educational project "RIC" offers modern knowledge in the field of Internet communications.  "RIC" works on the basis of the National Research Technological University MISiS - one of the leading universities of the country, aimed at training personnel for high-tech industries and businesses. <br><br>  The main qualitative feature and competitive advantage of the program is the practical orientation of training, as well as the principle of ‚Äúup-to-date knowledge‚Äù.  Graduates of our courses receive state documents on the successful completion of training, as well as a diploma from RIK, which has long been a symbol of success and quality. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/190192/">https://habr.com/ru/post/190192/</a></p>
