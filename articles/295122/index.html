  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Gett Taxi Service launches in new cities and increases competition with Uber and Yandex.Taxi</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <a href="http://gett.com/ru">Gett's</a> online taxi service is launched in five more million-plus Russian cities.  On October 7, the service will appear in Rostov-on-Don, Samara, Krasnoyarsk, as well as in Sochi and Yekaterinburg. <br><br>  According to representatives of Gett, in these cities a growing number of licenses issued for taxi cars.  ‚ÄúThe share of illegal immigrants does not exceed 50% in each of the markets.  A license is a prerequisite for working with the service.  For example, in Rostov-on-Don, as in the Sverdlovsk region, more than 19 thousand licenses have already been issued, and in Samara their number exceeds 8 thousand, ‚Äùexplains service representative Alena Balakireva. <br><br>  The average bill for taxi services in Krasnoyarsk and Rostov-on-Don is about 200 rubles, in Sochi and Yekaterinburg - 220-240 rubles, in Samara - about 180 rubles. <a name="habracut"></a>  According to analysts Gett, in Sochi, the annual turnover of the taxi market is about 20 billion rubles, in Rostov-on-Don - 6 billion rubles.  Samara and Krasnoyarsk each account for 5 billion rubles, while Yekaterinburg accounts for about 4 billion rubles.

      In Gett, they note that they have invested mainly in marketing and promotion to enter new markets.  The source of Kommersant <a href="http://www.kommersant.ru/doc/2826409">believes</a> that the cost of launching a service in a new city "may be tens of millions of rubles, but Sochi is expensive and, of course, demanded large investments than other cities." <br><br>  In addition to the cities listed above, the service operates in Moscow, St. Petersburg, Novosibirsk and Nizhny Novgorod.  Gett estimates the entire Russian taxi transportation market at $ 9 billion (572 billion rubles at the Central Bank exchange rate). <br><br>  Gett operates in 57 cities around the world, including New York, London, Manchester, Liverpool and Tel Aviv.  Co-owners of the company are <a href="http://www.accessindustries.com/">Access Industries</a> Leonard Blavatnik, funds of <a href="http://www.kreoscapital.com/">Kreos Capital</a> and <a href="http://inventurepartners.ru/">InVenture Partners</a> , as well as the founders of the project Shahar Weiser and Roi Mohr. <br><br>  According to Gett, the service is used by more than 10 million people.  According to CrunchBase, the total amount of investment received by the project reached $ 220 million.  In Russia, the UK and Israel, service is consistently making a profit.  In the US, this has not yet been achieved.  The expected revenue of Gett from taxi services in 2015 should reach $ 500 million. <br><br>  Last week, in his interview, the founder of Gett <a href="http://megamozg.ru/post/19864/">told</a> about taxi drivers' earnings, as well as about a new, extra-budgetary, service class.  Now the minimum price for a taxi service will be reduced by 40%.  In addition, Gett develops new service niches for consumers - from food delivery and manicure to major repairs. <br><br>  In Yekaterinburg, <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25AF%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA%25D1%2581.%25D0%25A2%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BA%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8">Yandex.Taxi</a> and <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uber">Uber</a> compete with Gett.  In Sochi, now two of these three taxi services are operating.  Uber is not running there.  Across Russia, with Gett, more than 20,000 machines are working.  Yandex has 30 thousand.  Yandex.Taxi also works in Moscow, St. Petersburg, Kaliningrad, Krasnodar, Nizhny Novgorod, Voronezh, Perm, Kislovodsk, Tula and is being tested in Rostov-on-Don. <br><br>  In addition to Moscow, St. Petersburg and Yekaterinburg, Uber works in Kazan.  ‚ÄúThe number of Uber users in Russia is hundreds of thousands of people, this figure is constantly increasing, business expansion in Russia is a priority,‚Äù a Uber representative said. <br><br>  At the end of July, the Russian Federation of Car Owners <a href="http://megamozg.ru/post/17864/">complained</a> about Uber, Gett and Yandex.Taxi to the prosecutor‚Äôs office.  In their opinion, the services violate the law by practicing additional payments to drivers.  FAR believes that such actions of taxi ordering services are ‚Äúopen disregard for organizational and technical bases, as well as the traditions of passenger car passenger safety‚Äù <br><br>  However, the Federal Antimonopoly Service of the Russian Federation <a href="http://megamozg.ru/post/17098/">does not consider</a> that the services violate the law.  ‚ÄúI do not see violations of antitrust laws here.  The conflict seems somewhat contrived to me, ‚Äùsaid the deputy head of department, Andrei Tsarikovsky. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/295122/">https://habr.com/ru/post/295122/</a></p>
