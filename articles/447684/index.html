  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How in the office to show company values ‚Äã‚Äã(without posters and slogans)</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Naumen began in 2001 with six employees.  The company rented a small office in a residential building in Yekaterinburg.  And now, in 2019, our main development office occupies 4 floors in the business center: we have meeting rooms for every taste, a classroom, a sports room, a spacious kitchen, coffee points and indoor parking for bicycles. <br><br>  In general, Naumen lives not only in Yekaterinburg.  We have offices in Moscow, St. Petersburg, Tver and Chelyabinsk.  We try to do all the offices in the same style, so that the employee, coming on a business trip, would feel comfortable and easily adapted. <br><br>  We will tell you about how the office in Yekaterinburg was changed last year to meet the needs of employees and to grow by 20% per year. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  We have made all the spaces as they are, for a reason.  We have core values: openness, flexibility and rapid growth of employees.  Another staff noted a special atmosphere.  For example, in one of our departments, employees do not call each other colleagues.  They call each other ‚ÄúBrollegi‚Äù, this is bro + colleagues.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/n0/p0/vw/n0p0vw53hzxl70ixez1atcbyfr8.jpeg"><br><br>  We could not ignore it and wanted to maintain such an atmosphere.  But it was necessary not to forget about the functionality of the space.  We make offices such as to help employees work productively and at the same time feel comfortable, and not just in an ‚Äúoffice box‚Äù.  Immediately, we note that we do not have open space, but separate rooms for teams. <br><br>  If the theater begins with a hanger, then Naumen begins with the reception.  This is the first thing that candidates and clients see, and each employee passes by him several times a day. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ws/wa/3t/wswa3tvnhe9mhvrapzplwyxmqre.jpeg"><br><br>  Office managers help employees: arrange business trips, issue an office, a pass, if you have forgotten it, make copies of documents, or simply print something.  In general, they do everything so that the employee does not waste time on solving everyday issues in the office. <br><br>  On the same floor with the reception there are cabinets of tops Naumen: the founder of the company (he is the chairman of the Board of Directors) and the financial director. <br><br>  When I first came to the company, I was surprised: how can the company tops have a secretary, a receptionist, and the office always be open?  And then I realized that it is quite in the style of Naumen.  First, it is convenient.  If the door is open, then we can approach the directors - sign documents, agree on something verbally, warn about the event, or just say hello.  Secondly, it is an indicator of the attitude of management towards employees.  In a company, all processes are transparent, and directors are open to employees. <br><br>  As I already said, we made the office space according to the needs of the employees. <br>  The company has large departments that come together, hold a retrospective, or present a new version of the product.  This requires a large negotiation. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/_e/dc/2x/_edc2xdueqrqgii-kbsahi0n8lq.jpeg"><br><br>  In the same negotiation we conduct trainings, for example, recently we invited a lecturer who conducted a two-day training in public speaking.  The training was conducted for employees who teach from the company at the university.  It was for training that we did not just a large meeting room, but a transforming room.  Those.  if necessary, it is easy to remove all the tables from it or to place them as in a classroom. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/my/cn/bt/mycnbtrwlc5-wd0ktt-crq6zsmy.jpeg"><br><br>  In this meeting, our employees watch broadcasts of large conferences, for example, JPoint.  We also use this room for events with students and schoolchildren. <br><br>  Employees like to gather right here to play, for example, in the mafia or poker in the evening after work. <br><br>  There are also negotiation rooms of medium size, and there are small ones, literally for 4 people.  In such conversations there is no large table, but there is a cozy round sofa. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/a_/nn/h8/a_nnh8vz2pj80bjunkp6ntxdpf8.jpeg"><br><br>  Often they are interviewed so that the candidates feel comfortable.  And small groups organize brainstorming and mini-meetings.  And you can just work in such a negotiation so that no one distracts. <br><br>  We openly say that our employees are growing rapidly in professional terms.  For example, interns grow to the middle in less than a year.  What are we doing for this?  The most important is the system of adaptation and mentoring.  Each newcomer is assisted by the adaptation manager and mentor. <br><br>  The adaptation manager is a newbie assistant.  You can tell him that you don‚Äôt always decide to tell your mentor or supervisor, you can ask a ‚Äústupid‚Äù question, you can ask him about the culture of the company as a whole.  Adaptation Manager accompanies the process of registration of a novice, conducts a tour of the office, introduces corporate systems, internal rules, where to turn on domestic issues.  And sometimes introduces the team. <br><br>  And already directly in the team a mentor is ‚Äúattached‚Äù to new employees.  It not only helps the newcomer to adapt to the tasks and specifics of the company, but also helps to join the team.  And interns mentors replace teachers.  They tell what they do not tell in the university, and show how to apply the theory in practice. <br><br>  How did we reflect this in the office?  For training interns and new employees are suitable not only negotiations, classrooms or training class.  Even the corridor fits!  On each floor in the corridors there are boards on which employees often write something, argue about what has been written, erase, write again, explain to each other ... And sometimes they just draw :) <br><br>  To be able to take a break from work with benefits, we equipped the gym.  It is a favorite place for both employees and office guests - students and schoolchildren who come to us on open days. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/cn/mo/-f/cnmo-fpmw2enqkulj8l-c2ligpi.jpeg"><br><br>  And here our kicker team is training. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vt/s2/as/vts2asndxbmnar8tsbi4q75tex4.jpeg"><br><br>  That year we acquired a professional table, the only one in Yekaterinburg :) We do everything for the team to win :) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/5z/sa/zv/5zsazvvnit3oometlt_qtu10fsm.jpeg"><br><br>  The kicker became so popular inside Naumen that new teams appeared, and the Naumen Kicker Team kicker party was formed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/t-/7v/82/t-7v82oza6pd8a1r8r0lfgpams0.jpeg"><br><br>  In addition to the kicker, you can work out on the simulators, arrange competitions with colleagues in table tennis and practice balance on a balance board. <br><br>  We have employees who do not like activity, but prefer to rest quietly.  For them, we purchased a massage chair.  And for creative and musical - a drum kit and an electronic piano.  They came to us at the initiative of the staff: someone brought the idea, we told the others about it and spun :) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/tg/rz/li/tgrzli8l3kiw-0-hvgt5-t1fk4i.jpeg"><br><br>  Employees contributed to the purchase, but not with the ruble, but with the NawBonus.  NawBonus is our internal virtual currency.  We charge it to employees for assistance at events, for lectures at the university, for presentations at conferences and for much more. <br><br>  Well, the holy of holies of the office is the kitchen :) We call it NauCafe. <br><br>  Every morning, the staff here are waiting for breakfast and snacks, and for lunch we are brought hot food.  It is here that we spend small office holidays and congratulate employees on their birthday.  And here is our ‚ÄúInner Kitchen‚Äù.  These are informal meetings of employees at which we listen to reports from both management and employees.  We will tell more about this in another article :) <br><br>  When the number of employees began to increase rapidly, the kitchen was the first to be redone. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/md/e4/00/mde400mklix3opazr8vkz4x7opu.jpeg"><br><br>  In the kitchen, you can meet a colleague, sorry, brollegu from another department or department, chat a little, drink coffee.  And if you are tired of the monitor, but you don‚Äôt want to go to the gym, you can sit at the bar, look out the window and just enjoy the moment. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/db/ex/pm/dbexpmvz-hbjwuoesny5dla5wu8.jpeg"><br><br>  In the kitchen, we made slate walls, you can draw anything that comes to your mind on them, write a message for other employees, or declare your company's love :) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ex/bf/ts/exbfts-1iplugj4v-jz0q3a5hi8.jpeg"><br><br>  And most importantly, how did we nevertheless adapt our office in Yekaterinburg to the changing needs of our employees? <br><br><ul><li>  Began to do more negotiations.  We make large negotiation rooms transformable, and we equip small negotiation rooms with necessary equipment. </li><li>  Gave a choice to the staff: an active or quiet break.  For lovers of active rest there are simulators, for lovers of relaxation - a massage chair. </li><li>  Increased the space of the kitchen, made it more vivid and alive. </li><li>  Supported the love of sport.  Now the kicker team itself initiates kicker parties and trains employees, and table tennis fans get together every day to play games. </li><li>  They made the space brighter, but at the same time preserved comfort. </li><li>  The offices of directors are still open for employees :) </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/447684/">https://habr.com/ru/post/447684/</a></p>
