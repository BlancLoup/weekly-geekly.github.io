Algorithm 2014 is held according to the rules of TCM / Time and consists of several rounds: warm-up, qualifying, three qualifying and final.  This year, the final game of Yandex.Algorithm will be held in Berlin in our new office.  Qualifying and qualifying rounds will be held online on the Yandex.Contest platform in July. <br><br>  For the first time, the Yandex.Algorithm passed in 2011 and turned out to be very intimate - it took place within the framework of the Summer School of Yandex in distributed computing.  Last year, 3,000 programmers from 84 countries participated in it.  Among them were the developers VKontakte, Facebook, Google.  And the winner was Gennady Korotkevich, who in the same year as a member of the NRU ITMO team won the ACM ICPC championship. <br><br> <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/yandex/blog/218705/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8cb/53b/e0e/8cb53be0e96d0a5db1fd463f5c4bf672.jpg" width="800" height="531"></a> <br>  <i>Yandex Office in Berlin</i>

      Yandex is holding its championship to support sports programming in Russia, to create a platform where our programmers can learn, communicate and exchange experience with colleagues from other countries.  The international team is again working on the Algorithm's tasks.  Last year, the authors disassembled for Habr <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/yandex/blog/191030/">all the tasks</a> they wrote for the final. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  To get to the qualifying stage, you need to solve at least one problem in the warm-up or qualifying round.  The qualifying stage consists of three rounds, which will take place at different times of the day, so that participants from all time zones can choose a convenient time for themselves.  Participants in the qualifying stage earn points on the "Grand Prix 30".  Read more about it in the <a href="http://contest2.yandex.ru/algorithm2014/rules/">rules</a> .  The top 25 participants of the qualifying stage will be invited to the finals! <br><br>  The TCM / Time rules are similar to ICPC rules with the difference that a participant can send each task ‚Äúin the dark‚Äù.  The solution in this case is checked only on intermediate tests listed in the conditions of the problem, and the final verdict becomes known only after the end of the competition, when summing up the total.  For such a risk, a bonus is given: in case of successful delivery ‚Äúblindly‚Äù, a certain amount of penalty time is subtracted, which depends on the total number of participants who have coped with this task.  Thus, the final penalty time may even become negative.  More information about the technical regulations can be found in the <a href="http://contest2.yandex.ru/compilers/%3Flang%3Dru">settings</a> section of <a href="http://contest2.yandex.ru/compilers/%3Flang%3Dru">the compilers</a> . <br><br>  The championship is international and everyone can participate in it, regardless of education, place of residence and occupation.  Competitions will consist of six rounds of 100 minutes.  The first two rounds are qualification rounds: in order to qualify for the qualifying round, it is enough to solve at least one task in any of them.  The qualifying round consists of three rounds.  According to their results 25 strongest participants will be selected.  They will go to Berlin for the final.  Qualification rounds will be held on May 16 and 25, qualifying rounds - from July 1 to July 15, final - on August 1.  The prize fund of competitions this year will be 540 thousand rubles.  The winner will receive 300 thousand rubles, the reward for the second and third place - 150 and 90 thousand rubles, respectively. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/094/dc2/fa0/094dc2fa0ddb206797a377c13d1b2b12.jpg"><br><br>  Yandex has been supporting programming championships for many years.  We sponsored training camps in Petrozavodsk, prepared the guys for performances and helped ITMO with organizing the ACM ICPC finals in Russia.  This year the participants of the Algorithm finals will be the first guests of our office in Berlin.  It is a city with an active IT community, and many people know it as the European center of the startup movement.  The finalists will spend three days in Berlin.  During this time, they will have time to fight in the decisive round, visit museums and communicate with each other.  All costs, including accommodation and travel, Yandex will take over.  You can practice on tasks from last year on the <a href="http://contest2.yandex.ru/algorithm2013/%3FpostId%3D7">Algorithm 2013</a> page. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/218705/">https://habr.com/ru/post/218705/</a></p>
