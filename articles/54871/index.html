Or "41 start-up companies have just received a grant!"</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> Greetings to all! <br><br>  The moment has come when I can share with the community the results of the 3rd round of the Microsoft Business Start program, which allows an IT startup to receive a government grant to develop or refine a product prototype.  1M rubles for the first year, only 6M rubles.  for 3 years (under certain conditions).  Plus support from Microsoft. <br>  <strong>So - the result - 41 winners!</strong> <br><br>  Behind a month and a half of project examination, 128 applications, 4 jury in Moscow, 4 jury in the regions (St. Petersburg, Tomsk, Nizhny, Yekaterinburg), 80 experts working, a total of about 1,100 examination hours, listening to the jury for 20 projects a day.  In general, it was not easy. <br><a name="habracut"></a>

      The results are published on the website of the Foundation for Assistance <a href="http://www.fasie.ru/">www.fasie.ru</a> in the section where Microsoft-Business-Start was announced.  I would venture to give a link: <a href="http://www.fasie.ru/anonses/anons_start09/%25D0%259C%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D0%25BE%25D1%2584%25D1%2582-%25D0%2591%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B7%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581-%25D0%25A1%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D1%2582-09.aspx">www.fasie.ru/anonses/anons_start09/Maikrosoft -BiznesStart-09.aspx</a> , although, I confess, I am afraid that the site may not withstand the interest :) Immediately I warn you that the results are only the numbers of winning applications , so that those who did not participate, they will not say anything. <br><br>  The jury gathered the most objective, attracting representatives of universities, IT companies and really existing investment structures.  Taking into account the fact that 7-10 people participated at the same time, in fact, none of the experts was not something that did not have a decisive vote, but could not even significantly affect the total assessment of the jury.  Received very positive feedback from external contributors.  Thus, <strong>we were able to realize what it was all about - an objective selection of IT projects in which the state has a reason to invest.</strong> <br><br>  And, as can be judged by the result, ‚Äúthe game was worth the candle‚Äù! <br>  <strong>41!</strong>  <strong>the project is supported and now, if everyone can cope with the conclusion of the state.</strong>  <strong>contract, will be able to get money from the state, as well as support from Microsoft in other programs</strong> (previously described here: <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/startup/52766/">habrahabr.ru/blogs/startup/52766</a> ). <br><br>  I note a few important, in my opinion, things: <br>  At first - positive: <br>  1. The important thing is <strong>it really works</strong> .  Several teams that received funding back in 2007 are alive and have a fully functioning business. <br>  2. <strong>There are very interesting projects!</strong>  With the consent of the founders, here are some examples: <br>  <a href="http://www.tarifer.ru/">www.tarifer.ru</a> (already discussed many times on Habr√©), <a href="http://www.linkphone.ru/">www.linkphone.ru</a> , <a href="http://www.stopredeye.com/">www.stopredeye.com</a> .  You can use it now.  I hope from time to time such teams will tell us "from the inside" about their progress. <br>  3. 41 software winning project - this is not a joke!  And <strong>about a third of all IT projects that win grants for START per year</strong> .  That is, by our joint efforts, software begins to occupy its proper place under the sun (the path is not yet in the country's economy, but in a single program, but still ...) <br><br>  Now is not very positive.  I do not really want to write, but I hope that in the future this information will help someone ‚Äúnot to step on a rake‚Äù. <br>  1. There are talented teams that, alas, do not have anyone in their line-up who could somehow commercialize the technological result.  Many of these, unfortunately, turned.  Although some were supported, it‚Äôs just that the hand didn‚Äôt turn to wrap it up, although they didn‚Äôt meet the conditions of the competition too much.  Advice - attract such people to your team.  There are good guys - students from the same HSE will ‚Äúdig‚Äù with pleasure, having become infected with the idea. <br>  2. There are "freeloaders."  Here I include those who: a) submit an application without even reading the conditions of the competition;  b) those who believe that "a ... - they give the loot just like that, it means you have to go and get it."  One member of the jury sat next to such "comrades" in the shuttle, going from the subway to the business center, and heard their conversation - then he sat with a spoiled mood all day.  Advice - do not go here, "loot just does not give here!" <br>  3. There is a separate category of those who (apparently, again, without too much reading about the conditions of the competition), applied for the development of commercial products, focusing on the maximum use of the latest Microsoft technologies, and only that.  As an employee of the company, I‚Äôm wholly and completely - for their use :) But, alas, if the applicant couldn‚Äôt show what the competitive advantages of his product would be, what the market was, what the strength of his team was, the application would turn quickly.  What is the difference, what technologies are you going to use for business, if you can not prove to the jury that the business itself has a chance of survival !? <br>  Our common misfortune is that, alas, the basic knowledge of entrepreneurship in Russia is now scarcely available, and people are forced to walk the rake.  Nothing - we are working on it!  As they say, wait for announcements;) <br>  4. Social networks ... every third application.  It seems no one has passed.  I talked with many investors from the jury.  Everyone has the same problem - the flow of projects where they invent a new facebook or ‚Äúin contact‚Äù.  One can speak on this topic for a long time, but it can be shortly - as in the well-known joke - ‚ÄúNO fish here‚Äù :) Do not try to jump on the footboard of the last train of a ghost train that went a couple of years ago.  Guy Kawasaki in ‚ÄúArt of the start‚Äù tells us that no one can say for sure what it is that will shoot, and it‚Äôs hard not to agree with him.  However, 100 sappers regiments have already passed through the field of social networks - everything that could have fired has fired :) In any case, it is worth bearing in mind if you are going to attract investments. <br>  Now, if there is a good new high-tech development that helps keep users on the site or monetize or something else, then any existing social.  the network will be pleased to talk about cooperation.  One small Siberian company sold its component to facebook, for example ... <br>  And, ‚Äúfor a snack,‚Äù I want to recommend to everyone who is going to submit a project next year - <strong>get ready for performances!</strong>  If you are going to create a business, in any case, you should be able to ask questions!  How can one come to the jury without knowing in advance how much time there is for the story, is there a projector, etc.?  And this year it was pretty often.  And since the contacts are given, why not call?  I suspect that a number of projects "failed" precisely for that reason.  Be prepared better - there would be no problems. <br><br>  Also, I note strangeness. <br>  1. All applicants were encouraged to register with BizSpark to be able to legally use all Microsoft software for development and testing purposes.  Of the 128 bidding teams, 45 registered in BizSpark. Considering that applications are submitted for the Microsoft program and not just for the START program, and it is assumed to use (albeit partial) Microsoft technologies, I can explain this only with one thing - a complete misunderstanding of why need a licensed software.  That is - I want to get support, but it‚Äôs not ready to spend that money, but even 5 minutes to register LiveID and another 5 - to register on the site!  And this is among potential commercial software developers !!!  Gentlemen, how are you going to earn money?  This is possible, I think, only in Russia; ( <br>  2. People often do not read.  Immediately they write or call;) Even if it is written everywhere that Microsoft is responsible for the technological side of the question, and the Foundation is responsible for the organizational and legal aspects, this does not save us from the calls at the wrong address.  However, there is a positive part in this, because it means that we are more user-friendly than the state structure;) And the Foundation will not write to Habr :) <br><br>  And one more information.  Already more for the winners of the competition.  Historically, we have always provided an opportunity for Microsoft-Business-Start winners to visit any of the Start-up Garage Training (www.startingarage.com) for free. <br>  However, in the 1st half of the current year, alas, we cannot do this.  The crisis changes everything a bit.  Currently, our plans to organize specials.  a group of Microsoft-Business Start winners in the second half of the year. <br>  In the meantime, the winners in any case have an excellent opportunity to get training at a special affiliate price (13500r.). <br><br>  Here, perhaps, all that came to mind.  The rest - in the comments, if you have questions. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/54871/">https://habr.com/ru/post/54871/</a></p>
