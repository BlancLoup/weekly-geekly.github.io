These guys took a useful and profitable niche for a long time, becoming in many areas synonymous with Russian freelancing as such, and, despite the inexhaustible reasons to be dissatisfied with them, they do not lose ground. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The reason fl.ru was invincible was a mystery to me.  Maybe he, with all his flaws, just turned out to be the perfect mirror of Russian freelancing as such?  Challenging the current paradigm of relations Russian customer - Russian freelancer meet constantly.  "Because he is the hero that freelancing deserves, but not the one that freelancing needs right now."  It turns out that it is useless to make a ‚Äúfree-lance.ru killer‚Äù from the next clone - Charlie Chaplin wouldn‚Äôt have a double like Charlie Chaplin.  Perhaps it is - to flush the fl.ru niche is useless.  But you can open a new one. <br><br><blockquote>  <b>When a new interesting proposal encounters user fatigue from chronic unsolvable problems, the further happens rather quickly.</b> </blockquote><br>  Yes, now a critical mass of freelancers has accumulated there, attracting customers, but the history knows quite a few examples of migrations of large communities - once everyone had an ICQ, and now, if you go there, the contact list will remind Poklonnaya Mountain on the morning of the weekday .  Then they went on Skype, now they are switching to Telegrams - when a new interesting offer encounters user fatigue from long-standing unsolvable problems, then it happens rather quickly.

    <h2>  <font color="ff9900">Some more lyrics</font> </h2><br><blockquote>  <b>The lack of a clear pricing policy generates a primitive market broth in which everyone gurgles who is in that much: customers take prices from the ceiling, freelancers drop prices below the baseboard</b> </blockquote><br>  What is the problem of freelancing as such?  The need to seek and the need to negotiate.  Hiring a person in the state, the employer does it once and for a long time.  On freelancing, this becomes a routine that takes a significant share of the time and effort intended to solve the problem. <br><br>  The absence of a clear pricing policy generates a primitive market broth in which everyone gurgles who is in that much: customers take prices from the ceiling, freelancers drop prices below the baseboard, and then they meet and agree on four of them: each with each other and his own personal toad.  In general, it is a constant bargaining, and the constant bargaining is a constant stress. <br><br>  Search orders - a separate story.  Coupled with the need to negotiate, the need for constant search creates a natural bewilderment: what about working, actually, when? <br><br>  Kwork, being the Russian equivalent of a successful <a href="https://www.fiverr.com/">Fiverr</a> service, following its prototype, changes the paradigm of the freelancer's relationship with the customer: instead of scouring for clientele, the performer works on systematization and delivery of his services.  Customers come to kwork like a store, already knowing what they need.  The care of the artist - to make his product look more attractive than others.  This is a great model for experienced freelancers who have already worked on their record books - now the record book can work for them. <br><br>  By itself, the need to structure your skills is a fat plus Quark, because  it hasn't hurt anyone yet to understand what exactly you can do and how much this costs.  And already the work of "Quarry" - to attract a sufficiently large number of visitors to your hypermarket - including  thanks to articles like this. <br><br><h2>  <font color="ff9900">From the point of view of the customer</font> </h2><br>  From the point of view of the customer, it looks even better: <br><br><ul><li>  clarity arises in who can what.  If a person offers an icon design, it means, most likely, he really knows how to do them, once he put this ‚Äúproduct‚Äù on the shop window.  This removes the problem of those who like to try something new at the expense of the customer; </li><li>  less stress: bargaining and the procedure for concluding a transaction are reduced to a concise minimum purchase level in the store: select an item and put it in the basket; </li><li>  less overpayment: publicly announcing the price, the freelancer brings it as close as possible to how much this service should actually cost.  Accordingly, the risks are reduced that a particular customer freelancer breaks the price above the market, which can easily happen when ordering a rare or new service to the customer; </li><li>  Of course, there are new ideas: knowing what you need is, of course, good, but studying the range of services at Quarry is not only entertaining but also useful - the <a href="http://kwork.ru/categories/fun-original">Original</a> section is especially good: besides thinking, ‚Äúpeople don‚Äôt earn money‚Äù There you can draw a couple of ideas for the development or promotion of your own projects. </li></ul><br><blockquote>  <b>Having looked at what people do not earn on - you begin to look at your resources in a new way</b> </blockquote><br>  Another undocumented feature of the "Quark": any customer can find in him a way to make money himself.  Surely, you, a successful reader, already have a good job.  But even highly paid specialists do not disdain to make, say, consulting - usually there is usually no time and no desire to look for a clientele.  But the quark on the site is not asking - did, the price indicated, and forgot.  Or, say, with its help you can turn your loved ones hobby into earnings - but you never know.  I know examples of businesses that grew out of part-time jobs for wives who have outgrown the businesses of their husbands.  And Quark may well be the place to start.  One of the amazing effects of "Quirk" is that after walking around the site, and looking at what people do not earn - sometimes it seems that they literally make money out of thin air - you start to look at your resources in a new way. <br><br>  There are really a lot of offers on the site - more than one would expect from a resource launched only in November.  The project successfully implemented the resources of the parent company <a href="http://mirafox.ru/">Mirafoks</a> , which owns the freelance project of <a href="https://copylancer.ru/">Copylancer</a> (just an example of that freelance that does not have enough stars from the sky), link exchanges and SEO articles. <br><br>  Seosh roots are not what it is customary to be proud of on a site like ‚ÄúMegamind‚Äù, but the fact remains: it worked.  From the project, which is four months old, do not expect such a riot of colors in the range.  The choice is such that the eyes run up, and the apparent accessibility (remember - all kvorki 500 rubles each) includes the weekend hypermarket syndrome: I want to run between the rows with the cart and throw everything inside.  Now on ‚ÄúQuarry‚Äù about 1100 kvorks per week are already being processed. <br><br>  Of course, this is not a panacea for the problems of the Russian, and indeed of any freelancing.  And eccentrics on different letters are also found among those offering their services in the "Quark".  But still, there is a pleasant feeling that clear frameworks and rules simplify life and discipline - the main thing is to keep in mind that within the framework all the same people are just living people. <br><br>  It reminds me of the story of ‚ÄúUber‚Äù, which took the private carriage market (freelancers) and with the help of a single platform and clear rules, made a kind of taxi that occupies a niche between the bombilicas that can be caught with a wave of the hand, and individual taxi companies (whose place is in this analogies can be given to outsourcing companies).  One of the side effects of this success was that Uber itself began to be perceived as a taxi service, which they vehemently deny, insisting that they are just a platform.  It is possible that Kwork has every chance to seem something unified and monolithic, like Uber - that is,  not just a site full of gypsies pulling fingers to your wallets, but an organization with a large staff of remote employees.  Who may not even consider freelancing as the main occupation, and from time to time to do a clear job at understandable rates - well, just like drivers of ‚ÄúUber‚Äù, allocating to him sometimes only a couple of hours a day after work.  This means that the demand for the ‚ÄúBox‚Äù and the quality of the services sold on it will be different - the project will need to carefully monitor the feedback and work with the performers.  In "Uber", by the way, in this sense, everything is good - they train their drivers to good with a plus.  Kwork will cope with this and can become ‚ÄúUber‚Äù for freelancing.  At least in the zone ru. <br><br>  PS Quark, as it turned out, is a very cool, catchy word.  Like a quark.  Or tweet.  It is very convenient to use it in communication, and it is even easier to calculate payment in quorums than in rubles - in short, simpler, more convenient. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/286346/">https://habr.com/ru/post/286346/</a></p>
