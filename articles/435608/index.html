First I needed a couple of screens, this is normal.  But then, as always, it took a little more, well, about twenty pieces. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  And it was already too late to change something in the project under standard covers.  And then I remembered one friend and decided to steal the idea from him. <br><br>  Several years ago in Minsk, in one interesting company, I saw a hand-held machine for small-scale production of covers.  It was possible to cut out tin from the tin with a hand or, better, with a laser, the contour of a scan of a simple rectangular lid with walls.  The limitations were: resolution in size - 2.5 mm to 50 mm and 5 mm to 100 mm, maximum wall height - 10 mm.

      The usual material for these covers is tinned tin.  Now there are plenty of opportunities to cut it for little money or even on its equipment.  I always chose the option to do it on the side.  Although something still had to be cut with scissors by hand. <br><br>  The one who tried to make such covers with his hands, knows all the problems of this business.  Even when cutting a reamer, not with your hands, but with a laser.  I am not an experienced mechanic, self-taught.  Therefore, it is easy to treat any criticism in this matter.  I did this.  At first I planned the fold line with a sharp knife.  Then he planned it with a chisel.  Then he clamped the part and with a sharp confident movement made the fold.  I personally, or rather my conscience, was always strongly hampered by the noise of a hammer.  A single elderly woman lived on the floor below and I didn‚Äôt want to disturb her. <br><br>  In any case, the procedure is not fast and rather boring.  I would not wish anyone to make twenty covers this way. <br><br>  Such a life, in addition to the small draft from some unpleasant situation with this Minsk comrade, dulled the pangs of conscience and I almost shamelessly stole the idea. <br><br>  I told her one familiar designer - <a href="https://habr.com/users/khazov_andrey/" class="user_link">Khazov_Andrey</a> .  He rethought it, turned the other way around.  And that's what came out of it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wm/n-/uf/wmn-ufesxp9-g01bhie56zxkojo.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  With this modernization, the machine has clearly become easier and cheaper.  In it, of course, you can still improve a lot, but it works. <br><br>  <a href="https://youtu.be/MPdm6xaLEK4">Video</a> from <a href="https://habr.com/users/simeon90/" class="user_link">simeon90</a> , which mastered the machine perfectly. <br><br>  Without any problems and without noise, you can make twenty or more covers per hour.  And the hands will remain intact. <br><br>  With the writing of this article, I also hope to free myself from the remaining torments of conscience for the stolen idea.  May this idea serve all people. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/435608/">https://habr.com/ru/post/435608/</a></p>
