  <section class="page js-page"><h1>In Great Britain, the creators of the Gh0stMarket forum were planted</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/0ff345e0/5607e909/7a086061/0689801e.jpg"><br><br>  Recently, the organizers of one of the largest English-speaking Carder forums Gh0stMarket were convicted.  When the police arrested two minors who were trying to pay at the hotel with a stolen credit card, the law enforcement authorities could not even imagine that these guys were the creators of one of the largest carders forums, Gh0stMarket.  Interestingly, quite successful carders, apparently forgetting caution, decided to pay for their stay at the hotel using a stolen credit card (the total bill was ¬£ 1 thousand).  This happened back in October 2009, when one of the attackers turned 18, the other - 17. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  One of the carders had a laptop with him, which the police decided to check just in case.  Imagine their surprise when data on 100 thousand stolen credit cards were found on this laptop, plus administrative data on the Gh0stMarket forum, the creators of which were searched for a long time.  The forum of users of the forum, according to approximate calculations, includes 8 thousand carders, from all countries of the world.

      Interestingly, after the arrest, the guys did not look for ways out of the current situation, but began to threaten the police, right in the best traditions of domestic chats (like "I find out where you live, and you will be bad").  After some time, the carders were released on bail, and they decided to go to a resort in Mallorca (it seems that when they were released on bail, they would not leave the place of residence, no?).  After resting, the guys returned home, and they "took" immediately at the airport. <br><br>  After investigating the carders case, the police found out that they not only administered the forum, but also actively used the stolen credit card data themselves, being real professionals in their field (only very careless professionals, apparently).  At the forum itself, manuals were published such as ‚Äúusing stolen credit cards on eBay‚Äù, information on how to maintain anonymity, performing all these operations and so on. <br><br>  In general, the court, having considered all aspects of the case, decided to award one person 4 years in prison, another 5 years.  The police also arrested the accomplices of our craftsmen, sentencing some to several years in prison, others to many days of correctional labor.  Such soft sentences, according to representatives of the court, were made only because of the youth of the attackers. <br><br>  Via <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2011/mar/02/ghostmarket-web-scam-teenagers">guardian</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/114907/">https://habr.com/ru/post/114907/</a></p>
