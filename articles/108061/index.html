  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Procrastination in creative individuals</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  If anyone else does not know.  Procrastination is a global human problem with which one can and must learn to coexist.  This terrible word is called such behavior, when a person evades important matters, being engaged in something that is not necessary.  In Russian, this is called "laziness."  This word has a negative connotation, pressing on the conscience.  It as if says: ‚ÄúStop whining, go work!  Less words - more things! ‚ÄùBut the problem really does not solve at all, but only aggravates, making it impossible to understand it.  Therefore, I prefer ‚Äúprocrastination‚Äù, hinting at a psychological problem.  This can already be taken seriously and with understanding, as a kind of illness, akin to smoking: if you want to quit, but you can not. <br><br>  The root of the problem is ugly elementary.  The subconscious mind is in conflict with the conscious.  A person consciously wants something, and the subconscious mind resists with all his might.  If this person is not aware of or has forgotten about the existence of the second, then he finds himself in a deadlock, not understanding what is happening to him, and often from despair plunges into depression.  But to realize is only half the battle.  The problem is that the reasons for such a disagreement can be a great many, from a lack of vitamins to children's psychological trauma.  To understand the cause is to find a solution.  I want to tell about one such reason concerning creative people (which are often IT professionals).  Maybe I will not catch a wide audience, but I hope to help those who are in such trouble. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  So, a portrait.  You are a fanatic of your profession, you can work on something for a day, forgetting to eat and walk, your head is constantly looking for solutions to some problems, in any job you try to find an elegant solution, even if it takes more time.  If this is so, then there is a possibility that further we will talk about your problem.

      Now about the symptoms.  Here you sit down to do the work.  Not very interesting (it is not always interesting), but it is necessary to do it, because as a customer-&gt; salary-&gt; wife_and_children.  All after all work, and you should.  Because it is necessary.  Before you start, you make yourself tea / coffee, you smoke a cigarette.  Then you check email, aggregator, twitter.  Then, for the buildup, read the latest news.  Having met something new and interesting, you must follow the link.  It is possible to cheer up, you go to BOR.  Then google to find out what they are writing about in bash.  Hike you click on the banner about the opening of British scientists and another banner with simpotnymi tits.  While you are doing this, a comrade welcomes you on ICQ, and you are happy to rush to help him solve his problem.  Then you feel light hunger or thirst, you look at your watch, and you quietly curse because half a day has passed.  Warming up your lunch, you nervously think about the fact that there is not enough time left, and now you will need to pre-tension.  You sit down at the computer, and with the thought "everything, now I will work," you update the news feed.  Grieving over the lack of news, you still glance at work, but from just one glance you begin to break and become nauseated.  To remove unpleasant symptoms, you brew tea / coffee and smoke a cigarette.  So is the afternoon.  The second, third day ... Or even months ... If a happy moment of inspiration or insight does not happen, then you, driven by the "furry animal", may make a desperate dash.  But not for long.  Intuitively, anyway, sooner or later you will find a more or less tolerable solution (if you want to live, you don‚Äôt want to live like that).  But is it worth your time and nerves of all this? <br><br>  Generally speaking, the reason for this behavior is usually not one, or even two.  If you delve into yourself well, you can make a whole bunch.  However, there is one thing that can give such a charge of cheerfulness and enthusiasm that all the other reasons will just fade and stop worrying seriously (although I would not advise them to score on them).  I will now say a very banal thing, but it may be exactly the obvious evidence that prevents you from taking it seriously.  <b>Creative individuals need to engage in creative activities.</b>  So these individuals are arranged that routine work drives them into depression.  Conversely, creative activity gives a huge amount of energy.  All that is needed is a creative moment, an opportunity to embody an idea, and it is already difficult to stop you.  It is for this reason that now, at three o'clock in the morning, I cannot fall asleep, and in order to somehow slow down, I am writing this article :) Here another problem appears.  How to keep to sleep and nutrition, and generally lead a healthy lifestyle, when the eyes are burning, and your hands are clinging to the keyboard, and you only respond to any external stimuli "now."  But this is a topic for another conversation.  And now I want to share my thoughts on what to do when procrastination has reached a critical point, and the word ‚Äúimperative‚Äù is preventing me from working.  You, dear readers, please add them with your personal experience. <br><br>  1. Hobby.  An important element in the life of any person, but many simply do not have it.  As a hobby, you can choose a creative process.  More precisely, he even asked for it himself, the main thing is not to disturb him.  He may well be in your professional field, and may even be very similar to the main job.  For example, some kind of personal project.  The difficulty lies in the fact that when you really need to do work, it is difficult to allow yourself to be distracted by a hobby.  Suppose you have to finish the work on the order today.  Time is running out, and about any entertainment and can be no question.  But if you fall into the trap of procrastination, then most likely you will not be engaged in work either.  And you risk not only not having time today, but in general to fill up the project.  Therefore, to deny yourself the occupation of an interesting business can be a big mistake.  Try to spit on everything, tell the customer what it is today, and take care of your personal project.  A fantasy that is not burdened with specifications will very quickly find an interesting problem for itself, and the head will start working.  After a couple of hours, you can feel such a surge of strength that on the same day you will have time to do all the work deferred for tomorrow.  The main thing to remember is that the interesting thing comes first.  Do it regularly, switch to it as soon as you feel a loss of interest.  But keep the work in sight, so as not to forget about it at all. <br><br>  2. Interesting tasks.  If there is an opportunity to find such, it is necessary to find them.  And as much as possible.  The more such tasks, the higher the efficiency.  Let uninteresting work remains for those who do not care what to do.  They will dig up any work like a sunflower harvester, only chips will fly in different directions.  Creative work is vital for you.  If this does not happen, you can simply become useless for the whole team.  Try to agree on the distribution of tasks, you can solve complex but important tasks that others are not interested in thinking about.  You can often hear from the boss that the work is not always interesting, but it still needs to be done by someone.  Do not be led to such arguments.  All people are different and have different abilities and capabilities.  And the correct distribution of work will allow the most effective use of each.  And in general, not everything that is interesting to others will be interesting for you.  Everyone's interests are different too.  Someone and the hole in the fence will seem indescribably interesting to drill, but from your interests, he just grimaces. <br><br>  3. An interesting job.  If all else fails, finally change your job!  Sometimes it is hard to do.  Family requires money.  His wife needs boots, the child wants food, the landlord demands money.  The boss asks to complete the work, puts pressure on the conscience, scares awards, inspires threats.  All against, everyone is persuaded to think again.  In this case, it is important to make a volitional decision.  It is necessary to understand and, if possible, explain that if this is not done, then it will only be worse for everyone, that it is not a whim, but a vital necessity.  Everyone is wrong, no one can foresee the future.  You could not fulfill your obligations - well ... You honestly did everything you could?  Then do not cheat on yourself and others, change jobs.  The main thing is not to change the awl on soap, and be wary of compromise proposals.  Analyze the mistakes and make the right choice.  And the result will not take long, the depression will evaporate, and the performance will soar above the roof. <br><br>  And remember that everyone has their limits.  Do not forget to relax, have fun and live not only work. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/108061/">https://habr.com/ru/post/108061/</a></p>
