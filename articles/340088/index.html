Or how to tame the registration form</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/e2/26/59e2260fb15dd189390075.png"><br><br>  Did you encounter a situation when you could not remember the password to enter the online store?  Do you often get tired of having to fill in fields that you don‚Äôt need?  Annoyed by the calls of the operator, who calls at the wrong time or vice versa, fear of missing a call?  Here I am often. <br><br>  This led me to believe that the registration form in online stores and further interaction with them is an evil in its purest form.  I decided to come up with a way that, I think, would make life much easier for an online operator.  My mini-research and rationalization deals on this topic are a tackle. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Prehistory </h2><br>  It was an ordinary Friday night.  Tired, after a fruitful work week, I decided to devote time to online shopping.  The most difficult thing was already over: an online store and a product were selected.  ‚ÄúThere was a lightness‚Äù - I thought, moving on to placing an order - ‚ÄúNow I will quickly pay for and sleep.‚Äù  But it was not there.

      So.  Here it is a product, here it is design.  Let's go, as they say. <br><br>  The first field "Email" turned out to be an obstacle. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/e2/25/59e2256a591bd099004164.png"><br><br>  It turns out that on this site I once ordered.  When it was not remember.  About the password and not talking. <br><br>  I feel like a hacker breaking the Pentagon, choosing options for possible passwords.  Does not work.  I recover the password that still remains.  I enter the data, poke letters from the captcha, send. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/e2/25/59e2256a93956043433444.png"><br><br>  Rattached by updates box, waiting for the password.  The letter did not come immediately, I had to wait.  Not much, but in conditions where I am tired and want to sleep, and I have to pay for the goods, waiting seems like an eternity. <br><br>  Finally, a letter with a password, poking on the button "Go to shopping."  Again, I find myself on the main page, turning to my purchases, to the cart, i.e. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/e2/25/59e2256a8ecb3962127532.png"><br><br>  I enter the data for payment and again ask for the password!  But what is this something today!  Oh, yes ... first you enter, then buy.  Would write "Return to the site" or "Complete the entrance," flashes the thought.  I climb into the mail, I look at the password.  Starting to enter data again. <br><br>  It seems that this, not the same bags toss in the end.  But in conditions when tired, there is little time and other obstacles that life can throw us, I want a simpler and faster payment method.  So that without dances with tambourines and vain attempts to remember what data you once entered on the site. <br><br><h2>  Research </h2><br>  If we consider that each online store considers it its duty to ask my name, phone, e-mail, makes you come up with a password that I can not always remember, because I haven‚Äôt visited the site for a long time, then this becomes tedious. <br><br>  According to a global study of the mutual influence of online and offline commerce Nielsen, 53% of Russians buy clothes and accessories online, 38% buy books and music, and as much electronics.  34% - ordered through the Internet tickets for various events, 33% - cosmetics and personal care products, 30% took vouchers and paid for hotels and tickets. <br><br>  If we talk about the frequency of purchases, we take the largest flow of clothing and accessories, then: 44% buy clothes online 2-3 times a year, and 33% - almost every month.  (Google research ‚ÄúClothing buyers on the Internet: who they are and what their consumer habits are‚Äù) <br><br>  Still, according to Yandex Research ‚ÄúThe Development of Online Retail Trade in Russia‚Äù in 2016, 64% of Russian online shoppers made at least one unplanned purchase.  Women placed orders spontaneously more often than men: 70% versus 58%.  Respondents say that discounts and store promotions were pushing them on impulse purchases. <br><br>  There are situations when, when searching for goods, we open several websites, compare prices and other information, make a purchase and safely forget about the resource for a while. <br><br>  This all means that people have the right to forget the password, which once lured a cunning resource. <br><br>  Cherry on the cake are operators who call at the wrong time, if the purchase was made late in the evening and the operators have already slept.  When you go home with two bags in the rain.  I exaggerate of course, but the truth is, not always their calls ‚ÄúHello ... you ordered from us ...‚Äù come in convenient moments.  All this is starting to annoy a little. <br><br><h2>  Investigations </h2><br>  In order not to be unfounded, I analyzed several online stores.  Looking ahead to say that the results were the same.  No one wanted to make my life easier.  All demanded to fill in the fields, which, in fact, I did not really want to fill out.  Writing to see the password that I enter, too, no one bothered.  The secret of contributions! <br><br><h4>  M Video </h4><br>  It's nice that they do not attack you immediately with the requirement of registration, but when you make out the goods, you still have to enter the name, mail and telephone.  Later, either mail or phone will become your login.  Well, you need to come up with a password after making a purchase.  Required requirement is 8 characters, and that there should be at least 1 digit 1 letter and 1 lower case letter.  Thank you for still explaining to me the advantage of registration, and not silently demanding, practically pressing it against the wall. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/e2/25/59e2256b2cb4c111560901.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/e2/25/59e2256b0a553944017553.png"><br><br><h4>  Ozone </h4><br>  Requires the same information as M.Video.  Registers automatically.  Difficult to remember the password comes in the mail, you can change it to something more pleasant in your personal account.  Forgot to change?  Himself to blame.  I did not find any strict password requirements, except that it should not be shorter than 6 characters. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/e2/31/59e231b631bd7917912210.png"><br><br><h4>  Lamoda </h4><br>  Still predictable.  But the password in the mail, as in Ozone, I never came.  I had to ask for password recovery again.  Restrictions on the number of characters.  Not less than 6. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/e2/25/59e2256af1111435623740.png"><br><br><h4>  Wildberries </h4><br>  Well, at least the passport data is not asked.  And so write mail, and think up a password, and the phone and code verification.  They also ‚Äúyelled‚Äù for nothing.  Low bow, in general, and a special thanks for the time spent. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/e2/25/59e2256ac0f3e523317308.png"><br><br><h4>  MYTH </h4><br>  All strictly.  When you click "Add to cart" immediately demanded mail.  Refused - left without a book.  Your problems.  Permission to enter comes in the mail, from there and let your start shopping. <br><br>  Perhaps this is the very desired path to shopping without a password.  I can not say with confidence, because I do not use the site constantly and have not developed the habits of such behavior.  But me, the user without preparation, such a demand scared away immediately.  Exceptionally curiosity made it continue. <br><br>  And the fact that the user is often too lazy to read the multi-letter after the title is also not remembered.  It turns out, a lazy user will read only "Give mail" and see the input field. <br><br>  From the unexpected yet, the absence of the usual login button.  I hung up on thinking how to see my wish list if I came out, then I realized that the entrance is the same as adding a product to the cart: click - enter mail - go to the site via a link in the mail <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/e2/25/59e2256b3655f417680312.png"><br><br>  Summing up the mini-research, I will say that this whole situation reminded me of the situation with offline stores, where when you buy a certain amount you are handed a savings (bonus) card.  After that, every time you want a discount, you must present this card. <br><br>  Over time, the cards become a lot.  Someone carries them in a wallet, someone in a business card, someone gets out of the bottom of the bag (pocket).  But this time.  While you find, while you get.  And I forgot at home, and at the same time the phone number is not attached, in general, the trouble is: you will not get your honestly earned bonuses. <br><br>  Offline, by the way, in this plan took a step further and made a more convenient way.  Already several shops, instead of solemnly handing me another plastic, simply tie up all the discounts to a phone number.  Came - called the phone number - points were recorded in your account.  Simple and tasteful. <br><br><h2>  What to do </h2><br>  Thinking over this whole situation, I decided to come up with a more benign way to place an order. <br>  Say your firm NO not only to the extra fields, but also to the abuse of your memory. <br><br><h4>  1) Remove the field "Name" </h4><br>  Ilya Birman wrote about his uselessness of this field in his article <br>  <a href="https://ilyabirman.ru/meanwhile/all/ask-for-name/">ilyabirman.ru/meanwhile/all/ask-for-name</a> There is nothing to add here. <br><br><h4>  2) Remove the field "Email" </h4><br>  Of course, I understand that marketing is already preparing for me a personal cauldron in hell.  However, I have repeatedly heard angry remarks that after buying you are beginning to be flooded with letters of promotions, discounts, etc., when I did not ask for it at all.  And try to prove it.  Because the checkbox "I want to receive ..." is by default active and cleverly hidden so that it is not immediately found.  It turns out that you yourself, my friend, subscribed.  Now rake. <br><br><h4>  3) Leave only phone number </h4><br>  Enter the phone number - you will receive a verification code.  Internet hypermarket "Utkonos", I think, did the right thing.  That would have removed the name and would be quite grace. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/e2/25/59e2256b5a7b3028465289.png"><br><br><h2>  Finally </h2><br>  What are the advantages in this approach, I see: <br><br>  For the user: <br>  - Fewer fields and body movements; <br>  - No need to answer the calls of the operator or twitch that he missed the call; <br>  - No effort is required to remember what email and password you entered; <br>  - Do you understand why this is necessary? <br>  For business: decreases the flow of "left" orders, because  to complete the purchase, you must enter the verification code, and for this you need a real phone number. <br><br>  Thus, the purchase (registration) is reduced to the field with the phone and verification code from the SMS. <br>  We remove the division into Login and Register, leaving only the Login.  In the field enter the phone number and verification code.  You can leave the entrance with a password, if the user feels that this is easier and more familiar. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/e2/25/59e2256ab81ab328870972.png"><br><br>  It seems to me that this approach facilitates not only the purchase process, but also the entrance to the site as a whole, since  Some sites require you to register when you try to more detailed familiarization with the product.  I do not think this is right, but now is not about that.  At such moments, it all starts in a circle: were you on this site?  And what mail did you enter and password?  It is tiresome. <br><br><h4>  But what about the newsletter, you ask? </h4><br>  Especially if the user wants to receive it.  And I will answer: <br>  Ask for the mail address, telling why it is necessary, when the user has completed the payment process.  Another thank you will say that they are interested in his opinion, and not overwhelmed with a bunch of newsletters about updates, etc., when he did not ask.  And the mail does not need to be cleaned from this orgy, almost daily. <br>  By the way, recently read somewhere information has come to mind: according to Mail.ru statistics, only 5% of senders have not yet encountered the problem of entering into the blacklist. <br><br>  Here is the whole idea that I wanted to tell.  Even more I want to hear opinions on this matter.  Why is there no such thing or have I just not met?  How viable, in your opinion, is the idea? <br>  Thanks to all who leave comments and opinions on this matter. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/340088/">https://habr.com/ru/post/340088/</a></p>
