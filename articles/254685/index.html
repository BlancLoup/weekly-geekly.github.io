In the summer of 2009, computers with several hours of UAV video recordings were also discovered. <br><br>  As the newspaper notes, citing data from senior military officials and intelligence officials, the rebels used unprotected communication channels with UAVs for video interception.  At the same time, they used software such as, for example, SkyGrabber, which can be bought over the Internet for as little as $ 25.95. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/665/f28/6e1/665f286e193c6b5569977e84f5a2ddc8.jpg" alt="image" align="right">  SkyGrabber, according to the description of the Russian company SkySoftware, "receives and processes the traffic transmitted from the satellite, extracts files from it and saves them to your hard disk in accordance with the configured filters." <br><br>  News on the <a href="http://lenta.ru/news/2009/12/17/hack/">tape</a> . <br><br><h4>  <b>2011</b> </h4><br>  Location: Iran <br>  Model: <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_Martin_RQ-170_Sentinel">RQ-170 Sentinel</a> <br>  Burglar: Persian Specialists <br>  Vulnerability: GPS spoofing <br>  <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_Martin_RQ-170_Sentinel">RQ-170 Sentinel</a> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ec0/0c1/aed/ec00c1aed5abb9b67a1cd24a101afb88.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Who will plant him?  He is a <i>monument</i> <br><br>  Iran presented to the media a press release stating the successful interception of the American unmanned aerial vehicle type RQ-170 Sentinel.  Among other versions of the interception of the device, there was also one that dealt with the use of special electronics, drowning out the signal of the GPS satellites and replacing it with its own.  As a result of these actions, the UAV automatically, guided by the global navigation system, began returning home.  Since the true signal of the satellites was drowned out by a false one, the RQ-170 took the Iranian airfield, taking it as its ‚Äúhome‚Äù.  However, this is only a version, although it is fairly plausible.  The first reports of this method of interception came shortly after the publication of the press release and were made with reference to an Iranian engineer who allegedly had a direct bearing on the interception operation. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/512/52c/ca1/51252cca1219206553b3ef52cb8da2ce.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Proof video</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/Uo_5Xhu9jtE%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhxY9fwp2J510cCjnvueLdnRiW0aQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/vorWHmk38yE%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhiCAQ5DbR12SHjEMbcybLAOlbzXLw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br></div></div><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3da/d52/294/3dad522948d54db7a1a42189224306e1.jpg"><br>  Iranians continuously troll the Americans.

Participants were asked to connect to the drone using their own programming knowledge, prevent the organizers from controlling the device and transfer control to their smartphone.  According to Azovskov, the process of depriving the organizers of the rights to manage drones did not cause serious difficulties. <br><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúProblems arose with the mobile application that is used to control the drone.  I downloaded it, installed it, and then it turned out that it works with errors that had to be fixed, ‚Äùsaid Sergey Azovskov to RIA Novosti. </blockquote><br><br><hr><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/63f/800/8f0/63f8008f01c947f68849b9e4e195b378.jpg" align="right"><br>  Location: Texas <br>  Model: Helicopter for watering <br>  Burglar: Todd Humphreys <br>  Vulnerability: GPS spoofing <br><br>  In 2012, American scientists from the University of Texas at Austin <a href="http://rt.com/usa/texas-1000-us-government-906/">proved the practical possibility of hacking</a> and intercepting the control of a UAV using GPS spoofing. <br>  GPS spoofing can be performed only for those devices that use unencrypted civilian GPS signal. <br>  (+ 1000 dollars to scientists) <br><br>  Spoofing a GPS attack ‚Äî an attack that attempts to fool a GPS receiver by broadcasting a slightly more powerful signal than that received from GPS satellites, such as to resemble a series of normal GPS signals.  These simulated signals are modified in such a way as to force the recipient to incorrectly determine his location, considering him as the attacker will send.  Since GPS systems work by measuring the time it takes for a signal to travel from satellite to receiver, successful spoofing requires the attacker to know exactly where his target is ‚Äî so that the simulated signal can be structured with proper signal delays.  The GPS spoofing attack begins by broadcasting a slightly more powerful signal that indicates the correct position, and then slowly deflects far to the position given by the attacker, because moving too quickly will result in a loss of signal blocking, and at this point the spoofer will only work as a transmitter interference.  One of the versions of the capture of the American drone Lockheed RQ 170 in northeastern Iran in December 2011, is the result of such an attack. <br><br>  Spoofing GPS was predicted and discussed in the GPS community earlier, but no known example of such a malicious spoofing attack has yet been confirmed. <br><br>  University helicopter spoofing: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/6qQXVUze8oE%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgxxpZ89_qm0WhX3jEWanzQNecGZg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h4>  <b>2013</b> </h4><br>  Model: AR.Drone <br>  Burglar: Samy Kamkar <br>  Method: <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircrack-ng">Aircrack-ng</a> , Raspberry Pi is installed on the drone, WiFi transmitter and receiver: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d20/463/989/d2046398905829cfc30ec033a0479bb0.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In his video, Kamkar said that he used the Aircrack-ng utility to hack a wireless network, and it was possible to detect quadcopters on the network thanks to the peculiarities of their MAC address.  All quadcopters of this type have the same type of addresses, which allow us to distinguish them from other wireless devices. <br><br><blockquote>  Kamkar writes in his <a href="http://samy.pl/skyjack/">blog</a> : <br>  <i>‚ÄúHow fun it would be to capture a drone that delivers parcels to Amazon, or any other drone, and make them your own zombie army.</i>  <i>Sumptuously."</i> </blockquote><br><br>  SkyJack monitors the MAC addresses of Wi-Fi networks in the signal coverage area, and then blocks them using its drone and disconnects from the iOS or Android device from which it was controlled.  After that, the hacker can control the direction, speed and altitude of the drone, as well as receive an image from the cameras. <br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/EHKV01YQX_w%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhiqixOszjDotewu2fQkvMN0wjx0SA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <b>Defcon 21 - Phantom Network Surveillance UAV / Drone</b> <br>  Model: Phantom <br>  Burglar: Ricky Hill <br>  Method: Wispy spectrum analyzers and WiFi Pineapple: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/i3_DY8Fo5Ps%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgmvT7r5bm4HGpaPNnVh9tTPXD1sg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h4>  <b>2014</b> </h4><br>  Location: USA <br>  Drones: Parrot AR.Drone and DJI Phantom <br>  Burglars: leading youtube channel Hack5 <br>  Method: <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/245717/">WiFi Pineapple</a> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/08d/65e/d35/08d65ed35db04a5facbbdc433f933645.jpg"><br><blockquote>  <i>WiFi Pineapple is a product of enterprising Americans who ordered a Wi-Fi router with two wireless interfaces and one wired from the Chinese, wrote OpenWRT-based firmware for it and stuffed it with utilities for hacking / intercepting and analyzing traffic.</i> </blockquote><br>  The presenters screwed the WiFi Pineapple to the DJI Phantom copter and then chased the AR.Drone and cut it down. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/UJhN4FTVlm4%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhii28ojDCn37FdS67l66bSjBHbgQw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Explains: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/xKfY0PmKDRE%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhj33_GCKhOHs3H_eFf5HkbPTguo_A" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><hr><br><br>  <b>Anti-drone system</b> <br><br><img src="https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/002/074/298/a9da7fb7c273070a7d644977d815ff03_original.jpg?v=1401406679&amp;w=700&amp;h=&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;q=92&amp;s=f18acb50e057ff37fb8a95e74e18358b" alt="image"><br>  <i>The failed project on Kickstarter</i> <br><br>  <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/532391021/personal-drone-detection-system">Personal Drone Detection System</a> could protect you from neighbor spying with drones. <br><br>  The equipment-locator detects an aircraft approaching you in a radius of 15 meters with a range of fixed operating frequencies from 1 MHz to 6.8 GHz.
