  <section class="page js-page"><h1>From the world by thread</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  There were times when websites were created to implement ideas, and not to ‚Äúcut the dough, but quickly.‚Äù  But any project, having become popular, still encounters simple everyday problems: paying for a domain, hosting, and the help of specialists.  And if the project creator often lacks simple enthusiasm, then the companies providing hosting services, for example, want money and are ‚Äúnot ready to work for the idea.‚Äù <br><br>  At this point, the project faces 3 possible options for the development of the situation: to close, enter payment for services, or ask for help.  The first is initially undesirable.  For many ideologically free projects, the second is worse than the first.  Thus, there remains only one option - to ask for help, which is what many free projects are doing.  It is no secret that Wikipedia, Mozilla and thousands of other projects of different types live on donations, while their income is sometimes higher than in the version with paid services. <br><br>  What are the options for collecting donations for your favorite offspring? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  1. Let's start with the payment systems on the Internet, each of which offers its own solution.  Among the most famous are: <br>  PayPal <a href="https://www.paypal-portal.com/charity/">https://www.paypal-portal.com/charity/</a> <br>  Google Checkout <a href="http://checkout.google.com/seller/npo/">checkout.google.com/seller/npo</a> <br>  Yandex.Money with the project " <a href="">Give a ruble</a> " 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      The solution from PayPal is very popular on Western resources, in principle, like the system itself.  The donate buttons for other systems are practically not installed.  But in the post-Soviet space, PayPal has not really got accustomed.  The majority of the Western system is completely unavailable to users from the CIS.  ‚ÄúGive the ruble‚Äù from Yandex also did not win the hearts of the project owners, not all of whom use the Yandex.Money system itself.  Paradoxically, the main minus of the decision is that to collect donations through these systems, one must be a participant, more often pass additional verification, and in most cases the one who wants to donate must also be a participant of the system with funds on balance. <br><br>  2. You can use specialized projects to collect donations that allow you to receive them in several ways at once and receive them in a convenient way.  Examples of such a solution can serve <a href="http://toodoo.ru/donate/index/">toodoo.Donate</a> and <a href="http://www.vkopilke.ru/">Vkopilke</a> .  This option greatly expands the potential audience and allows you to save yourself from connecting to multiple systems.  But in this case, the audience is limited to users of the systems that are connected to this project. <br><br>  3. Finally, the most convenient and simple (in my humble opinion) option is to accept donations via SMS.  Yes, mobile operators take the lion's share of the cost of SMS and you will get only 30-50%, but this is a robbery in broad daylight.  But this is the easiest way for you and the one who still wants to help you.  All that is needed is to have a mobile phone and an instruction with the text of the message and a short number.  The desire to help is often impulsive, when transferring money through payment systems it can cool down in the process of performing all the necessary actions, and in the case of SMS, the user will have time to send it before changing his mind. <br><br>  There are a lot of sms companies on the Russian market that can be used for donations (here is an <a href="http://sms-business.ru/%25D0%25A1%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D1%2586%25D0%25B0_%25D1%2581%25D0%25BC%25D1%2581_%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2.html">overview of the main SMS billing</a> ), but the most important project is the <a href="http://smskopilka.ru/">SMS.pile</a> from <a href="http://www.movable.ru/">Movable</a> and <a href="http://smscoin.com/info/smsdonate/">sms: donate</a> from <a href="http://smscoin.com/info/about/">SmsCoin</a> .  The first, at least due to the fact that he was the first of its kind and is still working.  The solution from SmsCoin is worth mentioning separately due to the wide coverage of countries.  The list of <a href="http://smscoin.com/info/worldwide/">63 already connected countries is</a> constantly updated with new ones, and according to this indicator the company remains the undisputed leader. <br><br>  If you fold the above mentioned minus receiving SMS payments, then otherwise this option is the most convenient and simple.  The high commission of operators is compensated by a wider coverage and a large number of donors, due to the simplicity and effect of impulsivity. <br><br>  If you have an interesting project with a good audience, then it can stay afloat without becoming paid and not hung with advertising.  The main thing is that it is interesting, and otherwise, I hope this review will help you. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/65733/">https://habr.com/ru/post/65733/</a></p>
