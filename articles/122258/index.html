  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Blackberry Playbook - almost officially</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Despite the fact that I am generally cool about the phenomenon of tablets, which this year, according to some estimates, has already been released more than 75, the Blackberry Playbook was looking forward to, largely because I am a user of the Blackberry 9700 smartphone and I really It is interesting to check how the tablet will work with him in conjunction.  Today, finally, for a limited number of journalists (there were four of them in all :)) a mini-presentation and a product briefing were held, and Playbooks were distributed to the tests.  About what happened at this event and how such briefings are held in general - under the cut.  As for the review, we will post it the day after tomorrow, but, of course, it will not be complete, sort of ‚Äúhot on the heels‚Äù.  Such a product as a Playbook, it is necessary to investigate thoroughly, and I will write my review after three weeks of testing, I will stay with him for a long time. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/FPZH4OysGZI&amp;xid=17259,15700019,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhi4i3WGbesmgdeB5mZtL9gu5jsC1Q" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  And before kata, a little fan is such a cool movie that promotes Blackberry tablets in India, and it is exactly the same in Ireland that they did not optimize it for their own market and change swarthy Hindu faces for redheads :).  The meaning of the video: Blackberry is now not only business, but also fan, Canadians will reposition the brand in all markets.

      The event was led by the well-known RIM Vice President Paul Lucier, with whom we have already published a large <a href="http://www.nomobile.ru/opinion/111250.html">interview with answers to questions from habralu</a> , as well as the Russian representative Andrei Kiselev (Bussiness Solutions Manager, who previously worked in Italy). <br><br>  Paul began by listing four main features that make the Playbook different from competitors, and demonstrated them ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>1. Extreme Multitasking</b> (hereinafter, the expressions of Paul Lucier, I deliberately left them as they were, it seemed funny :)) <br>  The main feature of QNX OS used in Blackberry OS is ‚Äúlive‚Äù multitasking, when programs running in the background actually work in the background, do not collapse and have no effect on the speed of the system.  This feature was demonstrated on a connected Playbook to a TV via HDMI and was combined with a second feature. <br><br>  <b>2. Super HDMI capability</b> <br>  When you connect the tablet to the TV via microHDMI, you can adjust a lot of parameters, which is impossible in any other tablet.  You can adjust the size of the picture, correlating with the TV diagonal (Normal, Zoom, Fill), you can change resolution modes and frame rates on the fly and, finally, there is full support for HDMI Audio - this is for those who have original speakers.  When you connect the tablet to the TV, the orientation of the first one is blocked: it will not switch to portrait mode anyway (which, by the way, was a surprise for Fields), so the picture on the TV will always be horizontally oriented.  Paul began to run a lot of different and heavy programs and switch between them, showing that the system is not slow. <br>  - Why is this necessary ?, - you ask.  I asked too.  Paul had the answer: imagine that you are on dacha and you want to watch a movie from a tablet.  After displaying a picture on the screen, you need to press only one button, which blocks the picture as it were - that is, the movie remains on the TV, and you can continue to work with the tablet: check email, surf and even play heavy games.  For myself, I came up with another scenario: while I watch a movie, my son can play on the tablet.  As I understand it, you can simultaneously run 52 applications. <br><br>  <b>3. Uncompromise support of flash browsing</b> <br>  This can be translated as unprecedented flash support: Paul began opening heavy intense flash sites to show how the tablet copes with flash.  He first opened wechoosethemoon.org - I had never seen this site before, it‚Äôs about the American space exploration, quite interesting and all on flash.  He launched Kennedy's speech and threw it into the background, then brought another video from Youtube.  The programs work in the background, indeed, live - when you switch between them, there is movement everywhere, the videos are not paused, and the sound of the video that is in the background is heard (albeit muffled).  Then another heavy flash site gettheglass.com was downloaded - this is already a flash game.  Attention was drawn to the ‚Äúease of transition and smoothness of movement on the map, as well as how realistic the‚Äú little shells ‚Äúare on the waves‚Äù and other marketing blah blah, which, of course, should not be given great importance.  All this was shown under the motto ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt need to look for games (which aren‚Äôt yet under Playbook), they say, play directly in the browser.  Several loud games are still there - followed by Need for Speed, installed on a tablet, as well as a piano synthesizer application (the stump is clear here, the fat smile goes). <br><br>  <b>4. Blackberry Bridge</b> <br>  After that, the journalists were given tablets along with Bold smartphones (SIM-cards with the tariff on which BIS is connected were installed in them) and offered to activate them so that you can test this function.  Not everything went smoothly - as long as there was no normal support for the Russian language, and even when selecting the English language in the initial setting, it was impossible to select the local time of Moscow GMT +3, London GMT 0 was necessary, the problem was solved only through Reset.  After activating the Playbook, I began to download the Tablet OS update weighing 318 MB, and then I had to download the Blackberry Bridge software for my smartphone, after creating the Blackberry ID.  Soon mail, contacts, calendar, SMS and BBM from a smartphone were visible on the tablet.  As soon as Secured Bluetooth was broken, it all became inaccessible, a ‚Äúlock‚Äù hung on the applications.  By the way, the process of pairing a tablet with a smartphone looks like this: a QR code appears on the tablet, which needs to be captured by the smartphone, and everything goes on automatically, although there is a manual mode - in the old manner, with a pass-code. <br><br>  There are some more cool chips that I found out.  So, the Playbook has an interesting server that allows you to ‚Äúrob‚Äù a video from Youtube - you need to insert a link to the video on the site playbookyoutubedownlader.com, and it will be downloaded directly to the tablet.  The idea is not new, such sites are full, but still entertaining.  I also learned how to take screenshots on the Playbook: you need to simultaneously press volume- and volume +, after which the screen screen appears in the Pictures folder.  I also learned about WiFi-Sharing: it is easy to attach a tablet to a computer as a removable disk over WiFi - to do this, you need to connect a laptop and a tablet to the same network, and on a laptop to join the server, whose name is the name of the tablet, the Run command on Windows \\ 1.1.1.1 \ and smb: //1.1.1.1 on macos.  Regarding support for Android applications, Paul said that soon (this summer) a special paid (?!) Application will appear in AppWorld that will allow Android software to run on Blackberry. <br><br>  And at the end of the event, the Blackberry 9900 was shown, which I liked very much, unlike the Bold. <br><br>  Well, there was a mass of behind-the-scenes conversations about the Russian office of Blackberry and its Russian team, about the support of developers, etc., which I will not write here :).  If you have questions about the Playbook, you can ask them on my <a href="http://twitter.com/turubar">@turubar</a> twitter, I‚Äôll be going with the tablet for a long time. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/122258/">https://habr.com/ru/post/122258/</a></p>
