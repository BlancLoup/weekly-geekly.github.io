  <section class="page js-page"><h1>We save money on domain name registration, but keep the quality</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  After studying a <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/hosting_and_domens/96012/">very useful post</a> I would like to insert my own, I think, important 5 kopecks.  And tell about how a small web studio can save 500% of funds for 1 procedure. <br><br>  It is possible and even necessary to register domains for 100 rubles. <a name="habracut"></a>  The scheme is simple - you register a large number of domain names (for example, 40) with the cheapest registrar (for example, atname.ru or domain4ik.ru) for 99 rubles, for 90 rubles, or even get them for free (affiliate programs, bonuses / gifts and etc.).  It is important to remember here that the cost of registering a new domain name in the first year is always different from the cost of renewing a registration for each subsequent year, so some companies expect to recapture losses in the first year in a few years.  But we are smarter. <br><br>  After registration and payment of domain names at a ‚Äúcheap registrar‚Äù, you complete the procedure for transferring these domains to a ‚Äúquality registrar‚Äù (for example, to R01).  You can <b>always</b> transfer a domain name, regardless of whether you are a natural or legal person.  Personal presence is not required.  The cost of transfer for jur.  Persons - 100 rubles (sending a registered letter), the cost of transfer for physical.  persons - 500 rubles (100 rubles for sending a registered letter, 400 rubles for notarization of the signature on the letter).  Therefore, it is recommended to transfer as many domain names as possible in one time (that is, within one letter) in order to increase the percentage of savings. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      The transfer scheme is unified.  If you are a jur.  Face, download from off.  the site of the current domain registrar of the domain name transfer letter template to the new Registrar, fill it in (list all domain names) and send it to the postal address along with an additional package.  documents (list on the same off. site).  Fiz.  persons also need to download a letter template, also need to fill out and send it, but, plus to everything, the signature on such a letter must be notarized (I could not find a notary who would provide this service for less than 400 rubles). <br><br>  You can also inform the new registrar about the acceptance of domain names by letter (already without notarization, if you are an individual) or through your personal account (in R01 there is such a special section in the control panel, so no need to send letters to them, most other registrars most likely, there is a similar section too). <br><br>  Now note: when transferring domain names from one Registrar to another, the paid periods for registering a domain name are saved.  That is, it is not necessary to re-pay anything at the ‚Äúnew place‚Äù. <br><br>  What do we have in the end?  Savings.  Registered 40 domains per year for 99 rubles, total: 3,960 rubles.  We transferred 40 domains to a ‚Äúquality registrar‚Äù of domain names, possessing all the necessary accreditations, certificates, extensive experience, the broadest possibilities and professional service.  If 40 domains were originally registered with a ‚Äúquality registrar‚Äù (the R01 tariff is 590 rubles, other similar registrars have approximately the same price tags), it would cost us 23,600 rubles.  3,960 (add another 500 rubles per letter) and 23,600 - is there a difference?  More than 500%.  With the money saved, we buy a pretty iPhone secretary. <br><br>  And when the paid year comes to an end, you can again find a Registrar with the cheapest domain registration renewal, transfer them to it, extend it and return to the ‚Äúquality registrar‚Äù.  Here, the savings will be slightly less, but also rather big. <br><br>  The average term of the transfer procedure is 1 week. <br><br>  Who will it be useful and profitable?  Those who regularly register a large number of domain names.  For yourself or your customers.  Cost optimization is more than significant. <br><br>  Yes, ‚Äúquality recorders‚Äù lose profits, but we do not violate any rules and agreements.  All within the law and in the framework of the offer.  Just another loophole. <br><br>  PS Also in the material <b>komtet</b> 'and asked a question about the elimination of jur.  faces and domain name losses.  Everything is very simple here - change your domain name Administrator.  To an individual, then you can transfer the name to any other legal entity again.  face (can be the same).  Suppose you are the general director of an LLC for which a domain is registered.  And you - the individual who wants to get this domain.  Write out to anyone on the street a person (or sister, or brother, or neighbor, or employee of the company) a power of attorney to manage the domain names of the organization from the LLC.  And write 2 letters - transfer of domain names from jur.  persons to nat.  To the person (signs the person with the power of attorney, you cannot) and reception physical.  the face of domain names from jur.  persons (and you sign this yourself).  You do not need to notarize anything (but if you transfer from a physical person to a legal entity - notarization will be required, ~ 400 rubles). <br><br>  PPS Many nat.  and jur.  Individuals received a ‚Äúdomain as a gift‚Äù from the hosting providers of their sites (for example, SWeb) without paying a penny for it.  PU of such domains is extremely limited in capabilities, you are not their default administrators (it is impossible to set up auto-renewal registration, apply for new domains, etc., etc., in general, you generally have no options other than editing WHOIS information).  The real owners are the intermediary companies (those good uncles who gave you a domain name).  And it is even worse, your debt at a hosting provider is several thousand rubles (for example, your LLC owes 8,000 rubles for renting a server and for the third month cannot / does not want to give this money, but there is no need for this server anymore, you bought your or decided to close this or that project). <br><br>  The debt amounts to several thousand and the renewal of the domain registration has come up.  You can not do this without covering the debt for hosting (balance one).  It would seem, but it is not.  Download from off.  Your domain registrar‚Äôs site (these are not intermediary companies that you owe money to, but other companies that you can find using the REG field in WHOIS), fill out the templates for transferring domain names to a ‚Äúdirect contract‚Äù (attach copies of constituent documents or passport) and send to the postal addresses of these registrars.  After 1 week, you will get full access to your domain names (although you did not pay for them, hehe), and hosting providers blackmailing you with the loss of domains, in the event of non-repayment, will be very surprised.  Neither nat.  Persons nor jur.  individuals do not need to notarize letters, nothing extra to be paid to anyone is also not required, the main thing is to remember the dates (1-1.5 weeks).  Once I managed to get control over a ‚Äúbeautiful‚Äù domain 2 days before its theoretical loss.  Got an adrenaline rush. <br><br>  PPPS Ask questions.  I would be glad if I help someone. <habracut></habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/98699/">https://habr.com/ru/post/98699/</a></p>
