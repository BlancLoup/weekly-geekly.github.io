  <section class="page js-page"><h1>About one non-standard method of dealing with locks: info-blackmail</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The hunter has the ability to hit the beast in different parts of the body with different effectiveness.  It makes sense to try different methods.  So in the case of counter-blocking, you can search for non-standard attack vectors.  For example, informational blackmail. <br><br>  One of the reasons for blocking is that from the point of view of people who have power, and power is the practical ability to manage, for example, TNCs and banksters, and not only security officials, the <b>state after blocking is preferable to the state before blocking</b> .  I2P, CJDNS, Byzantium - this is a means of defense, not attack.  The emphasis is on the interests of those who oppose blockages, and not on the interests of those who are interested in these blockages.  By attack, I understand such legal actions so that the state after blocking becomes worse than before, from the point of view of people who have power and are interested in blocking.  And locks will begin to be sabotaged from within.  Claims of right holders will begin to be actively challenged or right holders will suddenly begin to tolerate this disgrace <u>as</u> if <u>by magic</u> and will cease to seek blocking. <br><br>  I would like to draw attention to how poorly used the potential of blocked pages.  Somewhere the site owners have removed the information themselves, somewhere the provider shows its stub.  Almost always these stubs disappoint me.  Large unrealized potential disappears in vain.  I would like to add some material for reflection on these stubs. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So, from time to time, the site owner or provider has to block a certain page.  Until recently, this was done extremely non-creatively.  <b>LJ goat hangs out, Lurkmore - a pig</b> , typhoonet posted a naive text in English.  There are at least some civic position on the sites, although I cannot agree that in our unipolar world you can find another magical country where people live as they want, but this is at least something, providers have stubs in general, everything is bad, formal formal reply. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      The idea is to get the most out of these stubs.  A certain strategist or several strategists suggest that site owners place an IFRAME or JavaScript code on each page with a blank, and through them hangs out some information on each blocked page.  As an option, site owners are themselves strategists who pay more attention to stubs.  <b>Task</b> : using the search method to find such legal information so that after the next ‚Äúblocking‚Äù the beast is very bad, not good.  And the beast will retreat.  Find spit on the stone, will begin internal sabotage.  In search of such information, you can pay attention to what information is being counteracted.  And I mean real opposition, not laws.  Power is not a sign in the office, but the ability to control that is realized in practice. <br><br>  I argue that anti-piracy law is exactly the sign on the office, but what the beast is really afraid of can, in principle, be downloaded on http, look at Yandex.Video, youTube.  Oddly enough, even on YouTube, blocking is rare, just opposition goes in another, really effective way.  <u>In principle, people can watch and read "seditious" materials, but they simply do not do it</u> .  This is precisely the ability to manage implemented in practice, and the anti-piracy law is a paperboard fud, which, by the way, also strikes at some good things for which it really needs to be counteracted. <br><br>  Literate people skillfully use the law of nature "butting young kids", directing the desire to "go against the System" in the right direction, so that they think they are going against the "System", but in fact remain in it, participating in the provided "System" swing pendulum.  Many pirates, by and large, are looking for opportunities to <b>take away their personal time, close their eyes and ears to be entertaining</b> and thereby remain in Sistema, thinking that they are going against it.  Talented people are looking for a way to vote with their feet - again, staying within the ‚ÄúSystem‚Äù. <br><br>  To attack the beast, you need to find such information, the distribution of which would be most undesirable for the beast, but it is legal.  From my belfry, it seems to me that this is the Concept of Public Safety.  More specifically, the video lectures, The Secrets of Managing Humanity (Petrov) or the audio lectures Insight (Efimov).  Considering that the atmosphere of ‚Äúsectarianism‚Äù was successfully created around the BER, I did not read it, but I condemn it, visitors with a prejudice may simply ignore such stubs, and the locks will continue.  Some other information might work better.  Maybe the latest news from Russia Today in Russian ( <a href="http://russian.rt.com/">text</a> , <a href="https://www.youtube.com/RTRussian">video</a> , <a href="http://rtdru.rt.com/on-air/">TV</a> ).  Russia Today is little known for a Russian person, has no reputation like that of a BER, and you can hear enough of it that people with authority do not want ordinary people to know. <br><br>  Maybe it will be a calendar of pickets unpopular in the media.  The media was noticed that some events swell to the size of an elephant, while others are completely ignored or discredited.  If you choose the sources of such news, which the powers that be least would like to see among the broad masses, you can hold back the blocking.  And it is better to combine, fill all the available space DIV ‚Äì blocks, implementing different attack vectors.  The powers that be are a heterogeneous mass, including those of them who are interested in blocking.  To different clans different approaches. <br><br>  In general, there is something to think about. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/193848/">https://habr.com/ru/post/193848/</a></p>
