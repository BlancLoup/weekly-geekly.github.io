These guys were engaged in the aesthetic part of digital products, did not bother that the site is under a technical hood, and perceived their work as a means for self-expression.  Basically they were interested only in beauty, satisfaction, and the opinion of other visual designers. <a name="habracut"></a>

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/dj/gm/s4/djgms4xyyvcx8xg9k4xw0f2p_pa.png"><br><br>  In the zero, when not only IT people and IT people relatives began to penetrate the Internet, it became clear that digital products should be not only beautiful and technological, but also convenient.  On this wave of understanding in digital products, a party of UX-designers appeared, who opposed existing visual designers - while some were striving for aesthetics, the second ones were fighting for convenience and clarity. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/dh/bv/pz/dhbvpzipaeku0fk-gawmb9hybow.png"><br><br>  The fact that UX-designers, unlike visual designers with their artistic or near-artistic education, were initially presented mainly by psychologists, was wound on all this: they were interested in digging into the users' heads.  They perceived the interface not as an abstract decoration, but as a lever with which you can create the desired user experience. <br><br>  It is noteworthy that those and others were not particularly interested in the interior of the product - the system itself, over which the design was stretched.  They perceived it as a ‚Äúblack box‚Äù for developers. <br><br>  Here it is worth telling about another grocery party that existed in parallel with visual and UX designers - these are system architects. <br><br>  System architects have existed since the 70s and mainly engaged in the analysis and study of the internal part of the product: how much it performs business tasks, meets technical requirements, and so on.  Architects perceived user interfaces as an addition to the system, which should help users to perform certain functions in a given technical framework, that's all. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/nq/k4/2c/nqk42czswzijdjdl6aiadoobmf8.png"><br><br>  So product development was broken in two between two almost non-intersecting parties - visual and UX-designers were on one side (despite the contradictions, their field of work was the same), and on the other, system architects.  What is regrettable, the product also broke in two. <br><br><h2>  What does a digital product consist of? </h2><br>  Let's digress from the epic confrontation of designers and see what any digital product consists of - a mobile application, an online store, an airport management system: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/y2/o_/3p/y2o_3pl979pj21s036st6lzhqca.png"><br><br>  The product begins with <i>three</i> <i>fundamental groups of requirements</i> : <br><br><ul><li>  Business requirements: business goals and objectives, customer requirements, business risks and so on. <br></li><li>  User requirements: the structure of the target audience, their tasks and scenarios of behavior. <br></li><li>  Technical requirements: technical platform, adjacent systems. <br></li></ul><br>  The created product must exist within these three groups of requirements that need to be analyzed, systematized and prioritized. <br><br>  The product itself can be divided into <i>three components of success</i> : <br><br><ul><li>  Interface: how the user perceives the product and interacts with it. <br></li><li>  Functionality: what features the product has, how it works and what it allows to do. <br></li><li>  <a href="https://netology.ru/blog/informacionnaya-arkhitektura">Information architecture</a> : what the system looks like, what the data structure is, what the data flows are and so on. <br></li></ul><br>  All this gives rise to the user experience - the subjective sensation of the product unfolding in the user's head.  How much this user experience will be positive and useful depends on the consistency and detailed elaboration of the three product components above: if the interface is ugly, the user experience will be spoiled.  If the application works with errors, it will not be used.  If the interface and functionality are all right, but the product has a curved system architecture, it will not be able to evolve, and as a result will lose its popularity. <br><br><blockquote>  It turns out that the product must combine the interests of the business, the interests of users and technological conditions, and it cannot be said that the product is more important: the visual-interface part or the internal architecture. </blockquote><br>  And a simple question arises: who should deal with the product? <br><br><h2>  Design and engineering </h2><br>  In Russia, design and design are two different professional areas: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/js/ah/nu/jsahnumriolotgmyvggekfpsb0c.png"><br><br>  However, if we dive into the original meaning of the terms, we will discover amazing discoveries.  For example, the definition of the word design in the Oxford dictionary: <br><br><blockquote>  The verb <i>to design</i> is to define the appearance and working principle of a building, clothes or other object by creating detailed drawings. </blockquote><br><blockquote>  Noun <i>design</i> - a plan or drawing illustrating the appearance, structure or principle of operation of a building, clothing, or other object prior to its creation. </blockquote><br>  And here is the strict definition of the word ‚Äúdesign‚Äù according to ISO 24765: <br><br><blockquote>  <i>Design</i> - the process of determining the architecture, components, interfaces and other characteristics of the system or its part. </blockquote><br>  It's interesting, right?  It turns out that the meanings of the words ‚Äúdesign‚Äù and ‚Äúproject‚Äù are identical to the verb to design and the noun design.  You can verify this if you look at the translation of the word ‚Äúdesign‚Äù in the Google translator: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pq/cs/c2/pqcsc233kn3-tbwmvgkhdqtm9kc.png"><br><br>  And this is a deep truth.  The fact is that in the West they do not share the process of working on the internal and external part of the product, because they understand that this is a single living organism, and only integrated approaches should be applied to it. <br><br><h2>  How to link the inner with the outer </h2><br>  But back to our designers.  We have a party of UX and visual designers who mostly only think about beauty and user experience: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rt/ba/ro/rtbaro1pih9dheelkqiz0dojaey.png"><br><br>  And there is a party of system architects who think only about the insides of the product: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/tr/iw/sa/triwsaqgmgxnqumwdm9p3sp5rzc.png"><br><br>  It is intuitively clear that for complete work on the product they need to be combined.  It is worth noting that the web development market began to think about this at the beginning of zero years.  Thus was born the position of a manager who holds these multidirectional spheres of interest: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/my/x4/za/myx4zak53kas-gz6_fwt8b906ja.png"><br><br>  Let's see what this leads to. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ka/xr/oj/kaxrojlx51mevcixka7lcqhfkqs.png"><br><br>  The manager is not sickly load: <br><br><ul><li>  First, he takes for himself a layer of purely managerial tasks: coordination of the team, work with the customer, control of deadlines and budgets, and a few more hundreds of tasks included in his list of direct duties. <br></li><li>  Secondly, no one eliminates it from the product component: the study of requirements, interfaces and functionality, writing documentation, control over the implementation of customer requirements. <br></li></ul><br>  These two large-scale, important fronts of work coexist in one person with difficulty.  If the manager is not immediately torn apart by the number of duties, he will be tormented by a more insidious enemy - an internal conflict of interests. <br><br>  Suppose a manager receives two parallel tasks.  One - to fix the fallen off order form, the second - to describe in detail the terms of reference for the next release. <br>  Naturally, the manager will first of all engage in extinguishing the fire - ‚Äúscrewing‚Äù the order form, because every minute the customer loses money and becomes more hysterical because of the idle form.  The task with a detailed description of the TOR will have to be relegated to the background, laying strategic risks in the foundation of the project.  And so it will be all the time. <br>  Having tasted the delights of such work on the agency and on the product side, I formulated another solution to this problem - to divide the tasks between two specialists: leave the managerial tasks to the manager, and give the product tasks to the specially selected product designer. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/hz/e2/0e/hze20ehpl_v8ryl0b8supf8wjfs.png"><br>  <i>Product Designer's Responsibility</i> <br><br>  A product designer is a person who at the top level understands all the components of a product and knows how to connect the requirements of business, users and technology.  A product designer is aware of how interfaces coexist with functionality, and how user experience is born out of it. <br><br>  Of course, he himself will not be able to perform all the tasks, so he needs a team and a key partner - the art director.  If the project is large and with a multitude of tasks, these two guys can be allocated separate functions and, <a href="http://www.zavtrasessiya.com/index.pl%3Fact%3DPRODUCT%26id%3D454">according to the laws of Adam Smith</a> , delegated to their subordinates.  An example of an effective command might look like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/bz/de/6r/bzde6ro7gd462hwzbkoho4taz6y.png"><br><br>  Thus, a creative couple is formed, known in ‚Äúbig‚Äù marketing as early as the 20th century, consisting of a product designer and art director, complementing the product manager.  There are exceptions from this case, but we will talk about them below, but for now it is important to remember that it is this approach that provides a balanced study of the product and its structural consistency. <br>  Let's see what we did with the roles in the team, and separately we will touch on some exceptions. <br><br><h2>  Who is in the grocery design party </h2><br><h3>  Ux designer </h3><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/3n/iv/z5/3nivz5elbbiqvakfwfjx-ammwei.png"><br><br>  <b>The task of the UX-designer:</b> to make the product convenient, useful, comfortable for users. <br><br><h3>  Ui designer </h3><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vx/q3/zu/vxq3zuumexc7lyrwsnscc9i42fa.png"><br><br>  <b>The task of the UI designer:</b> to make "beautiful" and aesthetically pleasing. <br><br><h3>  UX analyst </h3><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ir/-p/mr/ir-pmrprkhhord33bjfh4ghuiv0.png"><br><br>  <b>The task of the UX analyst is to</b> get into the user's head, to extract important information and transfer information to the UX designer for implementation in the design. <br><br><h3>  System architect </h3><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/o4/j2/1j/o4j21j_vkash7m_4adhtqsvqlim.png"><br><br>  <b>The task of the system architect: to</b> work out the internal logic and architecture of the product. <br><br><h3>  Product designer </h3><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pv/bh/9x/pvbh9xhfo0_b_e0zi9wbpfdqnd8.png"><br><br>  <b>The task of the product designer:</b> to reduce all the "threads" of the product creation and be responsible for the result. <br><br><h3>  Product manager </h3><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jb/4x/iu/jb4xiuavcuadxsdnrrocxjbshsy.png"><br><br>  <b>The task of the product manager: to</b> combine the manager and the product designer. <br><br><blockquote> The attentive reader will say: ‚ÄúWait, what kind of product manager, because all the time we tried to share the grocery and management component!‚Äù. <br>  True, but everything has exceptions.  If the product is one, and preferably does not flow in a customized development format, then this approach is effective - the manager has enough opportunities to keep in mind all aspects of the product, as well as organizational features.  On several products, this role does not work - the product manager will literally tear apart the number of tasks. <br></blockquote><br><h3>  Product lead / product director </h3><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ve/nj/qf/venjqfdgh0ps8sht0qm_2keqzlk.png"><br><br>  <b>The task of the product lead:</b> follow the development of the product.  This role is a ‚Äúsuperstructure‚Äù above the role of the product manager, and concentrates in his hands not only the functions of creating the product, but also the development of the product in the future. <br><br><h2>  How to choose a profession </h2><br>  If you are confused in a huge set of design professions and do not know where to start, you can use the sign: <br><table><tbody><tr><td>  <b>Interestingly</b> <br></td><td>  <b>Suitable profession</b> <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Psychology <br></td><td>  UX analytics <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Internal component <br></td><td>  System architect <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Paint <br></td><td>  Ui designer <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Psychology + draw <br></td><td>  Ux designer <br></td></tr><tr><td>  All at once <br></td><td>  Product Designer, Product Manager, Product Lead <br></td></tr></tbody></table><br>  I will note that if you are interested in ‚Äúall at once‚Äù - be ready to learn.  In the profession of product designer do not immediately fall, but rather "grow" from the adjacent field. <br><br><h2>  From the Editor </h2><br><ul><li>  Profession: ‚Äú <a href="https://netology.ru/programs/product-design">Grocery Designer</a> ‚Äù </li><li>  Profession: ‚Äú <a href="https://netology.ru/programs/ui-design">UI-designer</a> ‚Äù </li><li>  Profession: ‚Äú <a href="https://netology.ru/programs/ux-design%3Futm_source%3Dblog%26utm_medium%3D747%26utm_campaign%3Dhabr">UX-designer</a> ‚Äù </li><li>  Profession: <a href="https://netology.ru/programs/fullstack-designer%3Futm_source%3Dblog%26utm_medium%3D747%26utm_campaign%3Dhabr">Fullstack Designer</a> </li><li>  Online course: " <a href="https://netology.ru/programs/web-design%3Futm_source%3Dblog%26utm_medium%3D747%26utm_campaign%3Dhabr">Web Design: an effective website from idea to implementation</a> " </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/421923/">https://habr.com/ru/post/421923/</a></p>
