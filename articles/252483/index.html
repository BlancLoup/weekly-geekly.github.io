It is as if you disassembled the Boeing 747 and saw that the fuel line is held by a clothes hanger and the chassis is wound with tape. </blockquote><br>  Ben cherry <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The program code is such that even if the site or program works fine and looks great, behind the scenes, everything that makes it work consists of errors, blunders and crutches.  He works barely and sometimes it is not at all clear why. <br><br><h4>  Fact 2 </h4><br><blockquote>  25% of the time in programming is spent thinking about what the user can do wrong. </blockquote><br>  Brian humes

      It actually takes more or less percent of the time, but each time we really need to think - and what can the user break here?  Where to click, what will enter, and how you can understand what we are trying to do is wrong.  If we only relied on ourselves, the programs would have too many problems - after all, we know how the program works, but the user does not know. <br><br><h4>  Fact 3 </h4><br><blockquote>  A programmer is not a computer repair specialist. </blockquote><br>  Ritesh Kumar Gupta <br><br>  The programmer works with algorithms and development principles, rather than repairing computers.  We can understand how the computer works and how the code is executed.  But this does not mean that we can repair iron.  We don‚Äôt know what a problem in Chrome is dropping it on your computer or why your computer is overheating.  Programmers program computers, not repair them. <br><br><h4>  Fact 4 </h4><br><blockquote>  Programming is thinking, not typing. </blockquote><br>  Casey paton <br><br>  For the most part, we program when we sleep, walk, look out the window, or do something else that allows us to relax and think.  Relaxation is one of the important aspects of programming.  You can't just sit down and write a thousand lines of code and paste them into the program.  We need to sit, walk, think.  Come up with a concept, correct its shortcomings, decide how it will work ... Relaxation is the only way we can use to correct problems. <br><br><h4>  Fact 5 </h4><br><blockquote>  Countdown starts from zero </blockquote><br><br>  It is important.  Counting comes from scratch - your 1 is my 0, your 10 is my 9. All because of the need to do things efficiently, when even a small increase in efficiency can increase productivity on a scale. <br><br><h4>  Fact 6 </h4><br><blockquote>  Programming is best in the stream - in a state of consciousness when you are focused on the task and everything seems simple.  This condition is also familiar to athletes and musicians. </blockquote><br>  Morgan Johanson <br><br>  Programmers like to work at night because it allows us to enter the stream, focus on one thing and not worry about being distracted.  Everyone else is just sleeping.  This is the time of day when no one is around, no one calls or tries to talk to us.  Great time to think and program. <br><br><h4>  Fact 7 </h4><br><blockquote>  Sometimes it is useful to postpone the problem until the morning. </blockquote><br><br>  Sometimes it is really useful for programmers, having met a difficult task, to sleep ‚Äúwith it‚Äù.  Many times I met the fact that I couldn‚Äôt manage to solve something for hours, but after only a 20-minute sleep (or any other dream) on waking up, the decision came on its own. <br><br><h4>  Fact 8 </h4><br><blockquote>  A "parent" can kill his "children" if their task is completed. </blockquote><br><br>  Not the kind of phrase you'd like to hear from anyone.  But for programmers, it doesn't sound so scary.  Programs often have a hierarchical structure, where the parent process controls its child processes that are running at the lower level. <br>  When the parent process no longer needs a child, it kills it ‚Äî when the program doesn‚Äôt have to do anything else, it‚Äôs finished. <br><br><h4>  Fact 9 </h4><br><blockquote>  You are not impressed with how much we know about computers.  We are not impressed with how little you know about them. </blockquote><br><br>  Seriously.  Enough.  We don't care how proud you are that you don‚Äôt want to learn new things.  Clearly, if you say ‚ÄúI know little about computers‚Äù or ‚ÄúI am not interested in programming‚Äù - but when you boast about how much you don‚Äôt know about it, it‚Äôs just annoying. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/252483/">https://habr.com/ru/post/252483/</a></p>
