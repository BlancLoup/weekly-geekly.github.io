On June 20, 2017, the following news was published on the Rostelecom portal: <a name="habracut"></a><br><blockquote>  Dear subscribers! <br><br>  We draw your attention to the fact that from 01.07.2017 changes to the contract for the provision of communication services come into force. <br><br>  Namely: when the threshold of consumption of incoming Internet traffic is reached in the amount of 1 Tbyte (1TB = 1,048,576 Mbytes), a limit on the data transfer rate of up to 64 Kbps is introduced on unlimited data plans for telematic services during the billing period (one calendar month) .

      Please read the text of the <a href="http://www.rt.ru/data/html/-1/%25D0%259F%25D0%25A3%25D0%2591%25D0%259B%25D0%2598%25D0%25A7%25D0%259D%25D0%2590%25D0%25AF%2520%25D0%259E%25D0%25A4%25D0%2595%25D0%25A0%25D0%25A2%25D0%2590%2520%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B1%2520%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B7%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B8%2520%25D1%2583%25D1%2581%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9%2520v2.doc">Public Offer</a> to change the data transfer rate. </blockquote><br>  <a href="http://voronezh.rt.ru/press/news/news24413">Sample news</a> , you can check for your area and city.  <a href="http://bryansk.rt.ru/press/news/news24413">web.archive.org</a> <br><br>  The offer includes the Macro-regional branch "Center" of PJSC Rostelecom and regional branches, which are in its administrative and functional subordination.  Unfortunately, it is not strong in the administrative division of the Republic of Tajikistan, but I suppose this means that it will affect all subscribers in the central region. <br><br>  About any additional options like "Prolong Speed" (additional package for money at the speed of the main tariff) are not reported in the news. <br><br>  UPD: <br><blockquote>  Since October 1, 2015, the Center and IFF includes Moscow and the Moscow Region, as well as 14 branches located in the following regions of the Central Federal District: Belgorod, Bryansk, Vladimir (combined branch with Ivanovo Region), Voronezh, Kaluga, Kostroma (united Branch with Yaroslavl Region), Kursk, Lipetsk, Oryol, Ryazan, Smolensk, Tambov, Tver, Tula. </blockquote><br>  <a href="http://www.rostelecom.ru/regions/center/about/info/">A source</a> <br><br>  UPD: On June 24, first the news disappeared from the news feed of the RT portal, but opened via a direct link, and now, via a direct link, emptiness opens.  The offer is still swinging.  In VK groups, representatives of the RT assure that the restriction will not affect all polls, but only aimed at fighting the so-called.  ‚ÄúPioneer providers‚Äù - by persons connecting neighbors and other persons not belonging to their household to their line. <br><blockquote>  The Internet for our subscribers has been and remains unlimited, there is no traffic restriction.  The exception is the subscribers-individuals who illegally use our traffic, providing paid access to the Internet to other individuals. <br>  This is only a ‚Äúright‚Äù that applies to individual subscribers (according to statistics, about 20 subscribers per month), but does not apply automatically to all subscribers.  For other questions, we recommend contacting the group in your region.  Contacts are published here: <a href="https://vk.com/topic-14501815_29245328">vk.com/topic-14501815_29245328</a> . <br>  Lexa, isolated cases related to the detection of unfair use of traffic (resale it to other users) are detected by monitoring the consumption volume only in order to provide other users with guaranteed service parameters.  In all cases, when a subscriber consumes a large amount of traffic, including more than 1 TB (again, there are about 20-40 people of such subscribers), exclusively for their own needs, the speed limit does not occur. </blockquote><br>  <a href="https://vk.com/topic-14501815_28103172%3Foffset%3D38600">A source</a> <br><blockquote>  Nikolay, the restriction will not apply to citizens who use Internet access for personal, family, household needs, not related to business activities. <br>  In case of incidents related to the speed limit upon reaching the threshold for the consumption of incoming Internet traffic in the amount of 1 TB, we recommend contacting the contact center; each case will be considered individually. <br>  The definition of illegal use of traffic, like the identification and elimination of technical faults, is an internal process of the company. </blockquote><br>  <a href="https://vk.com/topic-14501815_28103172%3Fpost%3D62172">A source</a> <br><blockquote>  Dear participants of the conversation.  PLEASE FOLLOW THE ORDER IN THE GROUP and remember that it was created to help our subscribers! <br>  On the issue of speed limits when traffic is exceeded, sum up: the Internet for our subscribers has been and remains unlimited, there is no traffic limit.  The exception is the subscribers-individuals who illegally use our traffic, providing paid access to the Internet to other individuals. <br>  The wording / limitations will be revised this week to be more transparent and to guarantee unlimited use of the Internet for bona fide users.  The group will be separately announced next week about the return of the offer to the previous form.  We guarantee that none of bona fide users will be limited in speed. <br>  Hope for your understanding! </blockquote><br>  <a href="https://vk.com/topic-14501815_28103172%3Fpost%3D62212">A source</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/356190/">https://habr.com/ru/post/356190/</a></p>
