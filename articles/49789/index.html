      <b>2. And I wonder when WebMoney will be convenient to the mobile user.</b>  <b>Namely, as in Yandex-Money to be able to access from any computer.</b>  <b>Without keeper and certificates.</b> <br><br>  Already now there is such an opportunity.  A new WebMoney Keeper with the working name Tiny has appeared (still in test mode).  Service site: <a href="https://tiny.webmoney.ru/">https://tiny.webmoney.ru/</a> <br><br>  This is a simplified, lightweight version compared to the already familiar ones.  But it also has a number of advantages.  In particular, it is possible to enter through the login / password. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>3. In early November 2008, was the victim of fraud, through no fault of its own.</b>  <b>I filed a lawsuit, I managed to freeze the funds on the scam account.</b>  <b>10 days after filing a claim in arbitration, they deigned to unsubscribe two template messages.</b>  <b>After that, I and the defendant found out everything that was necessary and almost two months had passed from that moment, neither answer from the arbitrators.</b> <br><br>  <b>Do you think that for the system of your level such attitude towards clients is permissible?</b>  <b>I have been using WebMoney for a long time, I have a seller‚Äôs certificate and a BL of more than 100. Support has always been the weakest point in the system, it matches the phrase ‚Äúbusiness in Russian‚Äù.</b> <br><br>  Since we are talking about fraud, and the identities of both (the plaintiff and the defendant) are established, it is obvious that the decision on the claim is outside the jurisdiction of the arbitration (in other words, the arbitration can not take sides either insists on his own - should communicate in the courts of his jurisdiction).  I advise you to write in the lawsuit a question to the arbitrators and the administrator - when the decision is made or the case is closed.  Specific questions in arbitration are usually given specific answers. <br><br>  <b>4. Hello.</b>  <b>Since October, at the webmoney forum, there have been clashes about the blocking of the wallets of the owners of online auctions.</b>  <b>In this regard, 2 questions:</b> <br><br>  <b>a) Why do you allow rudeness and almost jail slang in working with clients?</b>  <b>Or you do not know about it?</b> <br><br>  <b>b) Please tell me the postal address of the management for postal correspondence and the full name of the general director or a person competent to resolve financial disputes within the Russian Federation.</b> <b><br></b> <br><br>  <b>Is it a month to process an erroneous payment?</b>  <b>The problem is solved within 1 day.</b> <br><br>  <b>Why are you for no reason blocking the wallets of Internet entrepreneurs, and almost on an ongoing basis.</b>  <b>I would be grateful if you comment <a href="http://nikitakorolev.ru/main/farewell-to-wm">on this article</a> and especially <a href="http://www.evgeniypopov.com/blog.php%3Frub%3D31%26amp%3Bid%3D43">this one</a> .</b>  <b>By the way, I join the opinion that the caliper works for you with two minuses, and your security system is zero without a wand, I took all the money from my account on one ‚Äúwonderful‚Äù day, and I did not receive any intelligible help from you.</b>  <b>But it is worth losing the keys and counting the gimor for a month to ensure their restoration!</b>  <b>I look forward to your comments!</b> <br><br>  As for addresses, phones and other things.  All the necessary information is on our website in the section " <a href="http://webmoney.ru/rus/about/contacts/index.shtml">About the System</a> ". <br><br>  Now about blocking.  This is a very common question and it requires a detailed answer.  The position of WebMoney Transfer is as follows: <br><br>  Arbitration ALWAYS refused and WILL refuse to service individuals and companies that somehow violate the <a href="http://webmoney.ru/rus/cooperation/legal/syagreement1.shtml">agreement on the transfer of property rights with digital title signs</a> . <br><br>  Denial of service refers to a procedure in which a user withdraws his money to his bank account and FOREVER leaves the system.  The ability to withdraw YOUR funds is ALWAYS provided, even in cases when the user specified incorrect information about himself (thereby violating the Transfer Agreement) during registration.  The procedure for this, of course, is complicated, since documentary evidence of identity is required. <br><br>  Typical violations of the transfer agreement include, for example: <br><br>  - User claims to those.  support or any system services (about restoring a backup copy of keys, etc.) for too long. At the same time, the user is aware that by losing access (forgetting the password, losing the key file), he ALWAYS violated the Transfer Agreement and it can be terminated with it.  If at the same time the user expresses his claims publicly, or even privately, but in an unacceptable form, then the denial of service should be immediately. <br><br>  - A user‚Äôs claim to block his account without notifying him (this often happens, for example, when a security robot triggers an unauthorized access, and it‚Äôs impossible to notify a user since his attacker and WMID can be accessed by an attacker). <br>  There is a persistent prejudice that the system has any additional OBLIGATIONS to the user in terms of service level, system actions, etc., not specified in the Agreement. <br><br>  It is necessary to understand that the system has only two basic obligations: <br><br>  - The basic obligation of the Guarantor is to return the user his funds to his bank account upon the first request of the user; <br><br>  - The obligation of the Operator to transfer accounting units from one purse to another - for compensation. <br><br>  Any other user expectations are most often groundless.  With normal communication and reasonable interest of the user in resolving problems, these explanations on the content of the Agreement are provided to him (this happens in most cases).  But in the case of user attempts to accuse the system of non-fulfillment of their obligations, to shift responsibility for their violation of the transfer agreement to the system, etc., especially public attempts - an immediate response follows - REFUSAL IN SERVICE.  And this is the most adequate way out of this situation, since if we allow the process of misunderstanding to go further, a later (and still inevitable) denial of service will be more painful for both parties.  We have no other way out.  In the system, it is inevitable that users understand the Agreements concluded by them in the system and follow them, or refuse to use and search for any available alternatives. <br><br>  It‚Äôs natural that a denial of service comes when users manage, even if implicitly, to the average person, but in fact they damage other users of the system, or criminal or fraudulent activities, such as: creating so-called VM auctions, Scandinavian auctions, various kinds of pyramids, services selling business packages, casinos, lotto, roulettes, one-armed gangsters, etc.  without a license in their jurisdiction;  services for attracting users' funds at interest without banking or other other licenses for this activity, etc. <br><br>  In this case, individual users also get the false impression that the system owes something to users who conduct such activities.  But this is NOT SO, we insist and will insist on our current position, which qualifies such an activity, as not conforming to our Agreements.  And we are able to defend our position in a court of any jurisdiction. <br><br>  <b>5. When will you start working on weekends?</b>  <b>The office seems to be serious, but here it is.</b> <br><br>  It is not very clear what is meant.  Our tech support works around the clock, and the system itself is even more so. <br><br>  <b>6. How to get your money back in case of fraud?</b>  <b>I heard you can send an application for some time and return the money.</b>  <b>Describe this procedure.</b> <br><br>  <a href="http://arbitrage.webmoney.ru/asp/default.asp">Arbitration is</a> available for reviewing claims and resolving disputes between system participants. <br>  If you are a victim of fraud, on this page you can leave a claim on the cheater's WMID.  Claims are considered up to 1 week from the date of registration.  All received claims are reviewed by the staff of the arbitration service, and in case of confirmation of the facts stated in the claim text, appropriate measures are taken (blocking the WM-identifier, closing the site that received the claim, etc.). <br><br>  <b>7. Will there be an opportunity in the foreseeable future to ‚Äúforgive‚Äù the loan disbursed, that is, to debit its amount from the D-wallet.</b>  <b>Relevant to previously issued hopeless to repay amounts.</b>  <b>At one time, the support stated that such a function would be introduced.</b> <b><br></b> <br><br>  <b>Possibility of early repayment of the loan, if the history of operations is lost in the wallet.</b>  <b>Now only auto repayment at the end of the term.</b>  <b>People‚Äôs stories are often lost, very uncomfortable.</b> <br><br>  Yes, on the credit exchange such opportunities are planned for implementation, over time they will definitely appear. <br><br>  <b>8. After reading all the above, the question arises, is it possible to work with you?</b>  <b>Will you steal my savings?</b> <br><br>  a) Yes, you can;  b) No, we will not steal. <br><br>  But seriously, you need to understand that WebMoney is a serious and complex tool.  At the moment, we provide the user with an unparalleled package of services and the highest degree of reliability.  But like any high-tech tool, WebMoney requires from those who use it, careful and responsible attitude.  If you follow our recommendations and follow our advice, working with us is convenient and reliable.  You (I hope) will not get behind the wheel, not knowing how to drive.  And even buying a microwave, read the instructions.  So here.  Take some time to carefully read the relevant pages of our site - and save yourself nerves and time in the future.  At a minimum - before accepting the ‚ÄúTransfer Agreement ...‚Äù, read it. <br><br>  <b>9. In which banks do you currently hold euros and dollars, due to the crisis, what is the reliability of these banks now?</b>  <b>If suddenly these banks go bankrupt, will there be any compensation under Russian law or can these funds be insured as it is?</b> <br><br>  For each type of title characters there is a Garant.  <a href="http://www.webmoney.ru/rus/about/contacts/guarantors.shtml">Here is a list of them</a> .  In the offer, which the user concludes with the Guarantor, the obligation of the Guarantor is stated to redeem the title signs from the user at any time, regardless of crises. <br><br>  <b>10. How can I declare income received on a WebMoney wallet?</b>  <b>Documents WebMoney does not.</b>  <b>If, however, simply withdraw to the current account, then there will be a concealment of income.</b>  <b>How to be in such a case, double taxation comes out.</b> <br><br>  We need to decide what type of title characters we are talking about.  For each type, the System has its own Guarantor, for advice on taxation, it is better to contact the Guarantor on the type of title signs you are interested in.  Their list <a href="http://www.webmoney.ru/rus/about/index.shtml">is on the</a> System <a href="http://www.webmoney.ru/rus/about/index.shtml">website</a> . <br><br>  If we talk about ruble title characters, WMR, then there is a special brochure dedicated to accounting and tax accounting WMR.  It <a href="http://guarantee.ru/Portals/2/metod.pdf">is posted on the website of the</a> Guarantor for WMR.  An updated and updated version of this brochure will be released soon.  It will also reflect the accounting for operations by natural persons. <br><br>  But briefly and schematically you can say this: WMR - checks in electronic form.  That is, in fact, valuable.  The Tax Code of the Russian Federation in article 228 clause 1 subparagraph 2 speaks of the emergence of income from the sale of property on the right of ownership of an individual.  The sale of property includes the sale of securities.  The income generated in this case, and indicated in the tax return. <br>  As for the documents.  Each transaction in the system is accompanied by documents.  If necessary, you can print them. <br><br>  <b>11. It is normal to block just the wallet that you used for more than one year and at the same time ignore questions about the reason for blocking and not having any specific reasons at all, or at least not notify about it.</b>  <b>And more interesting, the money of people who have blocked wallets for various reasons, evaporate?</b>  <b>Or just go to your asset?</b> <br><br>  A detailed answer to the blocking question has already been given above.  Funds from the "frozen" wallet will not disappear.  If the user is denied service, he is ALWAYS given the opportunity to withdraw funds to a bank account.  To do this, the corresponding instructions are sent to the internal VM mail of the VM identifier. <br><br>  <b>12. I would like to know if the work of technical support is monitored, why are tech support specialists rude?</b> <br><br>  Yes, technical support work is monitored.  All conversations are recorded.  When you call, the operator is obliged to call your number.  If necessary, you can file a complaint, indicating this number and the time of your appeal.  The complaint will be reviewed. <br><br>  <b>13. Do you think that tech support staff thinks not about the interests of the company, but about their own?</b>  <b>We felt like kings, which can ban users not for violations, but for example, for the rudeness provoked by them in the WebMoney forum.</b> <br><br>  The work of technical support is, alas, such a link where the ‚Äúhuman factor‚Äù cannot be completely excluded ... What can be said?  We hope, misunderstandings will not weigh for you the convenience of working with WebMoney Transfer. <br><br>  <b>14. Why did you stop issuing virtual cards?</b>  <b>Will Keeper be developed for Mac OS?</b>  <b>When?</b> <br><br>  <b>When will the Virtual Visa service start to work steadily?</b>  <b>When will the balance be displayed on the cards normally?</b>  <b>When will versions for non-Win platforms appear?</b>  <b>ENUM and Light not to offer.</b> <br><br>  The Visa Virtual project is experiencing some objective difficulties.  we plan to overcome them in January.  The balance on Payoneer cards can be seen on the <a href="http://www.payoneer.com/">Payoneer</a> website, on Visa Virtual and Banque (Powercheque) the balance is currently displayed everywhere.  Sometimes, through no fault of ours, technical problems arise, they are objective, they can only be waited.  For non-Win platforms, besides WM Keeper Light, a new keeper with the working title <a href="https://tiny.webmoney.ru/">Tiny</a> will soon be offered. <br><br>  <b>15. On the main page of the site various global statistics on operations in the system are published.</b>  <b>I would very much like to know the amount of turnover on blocked wallets (on the basis of and without), for any period of time, for example, in 2008, or to voice what part of the profit (so to speak ‚Äúbonus‚Äù profit) of the system make up these funds.</b> <br><br>  The system makes a profit from the commission from the transaction, and not from the storage of funds (we are not a bank).  And now the question is for you: if the wallet is blocked and the funds on it are frozen, what system can the income be from it? <br><br>  <b>16. Is it planned to open a service for accepting deposits from users (in other words, to open a bank)?</b> <br><br>  No, we are not engaged and do not plan to engage in banking. <br><br>  <b>17. Who is the owner of WebMoney?</b>  <b>What will happen to WebMoney in connection with the global financial crisis, is it worth it to withdraw money from the purse holder money in rubles or convert them into currency?</b> <br><br>  WebMoney owner - <a href="http://www.webmoney.ru/rus/about/">WM Transfer Ltd.</a>  In connection with the crisis with WebMoney everything will be fine.  But what will happen to world currencies is already a question to the wrong address. <br><br>  <b>18. Still interested in this moment.</b>  <b>Is it true that you have a filter system configured, and if the wallet falls under a certain filter - is it automatically blocked?</b>  <b>For example: a formal certificate and the amount of more than $ 500 = ban comes to the wallet.</b> <br><br>  No, there are no filters (it is easy to test experimentally, with the required amount), but if you violate any of the agreements you have adopted, the appropriate measures will be taken.  How the control mechanism works - we do not disclose. <br><br>  <b>19. If the buyer buys something and he rarely makes a positive review, but there are individuals with formal certificates (usually competitors) and if such a person complains, then immediately ban without trial.</b>  <b>And well, if there was a complaint from an authoritative user, as well as from some kind of shantrap who have nothing to do or they can be so entertained.</b> <br><br>  If you run any business on the Web and receive funds for something from third parties, you MUST get a personal certificate (or better yet, register in the Megastock catalog and get a seller certificate).  In this case, things like the one described by you will be impossible. <br><br>  <b>20. Will WebMoney make a normal binding to a visa or mastercards?</b>  <b>It would be very useful and expanded functionality.</b> <br><br>  What is meant by "normal binding"?  There is a dollar <a href="https://cards.webmoney.ru/asp/wmsafepay.asp">Visa Virtual</a> , dollar <a href="https://cards.webmoney.ru/asp/wmpayoneer.asp">Mastercard</a> .  On <a href="https://cards.guarantee.ru/">Cards.Guarantee</a> you can transfer to HandyBank card.  Soon this list will be expanded with the help of cards from other banks. <br><br>  <b>21. When will it be possible to bind your plastic card to a WM purse, as is done in Paypal, which will allow ordinary ordinary citizens to use the system, entrepreneurs do not care about card processing, and webmoney become a real payment system, not an advanced geek community?</b> <br><br>  Credit cards and digital cash are completely different models, in many ways they contradict each other (for example, cards can be used to cancel a payment, and so on).  At the current level of technology development, these two models have not yet become friends.  Although there have been attempts, and we are not discarding this idea.  But at the moment, bank cards do not meet the minimum requirements for security and reliability when used on the Web.  We cannot verify such a payment and make sure that it is made by the true owner of a bank card.  And do not forget that PayPal has a different principle of operation; in PayPal, an electronic wallet is initially linked to a bank account. <br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">22. Why do I constantly see this when paying and so on: </font></font><br></b> <br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">forum.wmtransfer.com uses an invalid security certificate. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Certificate issuer certificate is unknown. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">(Error code: sec_error_unknown_issuer) </font></font></b> <br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Not to get certificates?</font></font></b> <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> We have purchased the certificate * .webmoney.ru - this can be seen, for example, </font></font><a href="https://cards.webmoney.ru/asp/default.asp"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">here</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . Unfortunately, we have not yet installed it everywhere, we will try to correct it. </font></font><br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">23. When will the thread in WM be a normal interface? Is it not this ActiveX that is now (in the Light version) and not a crooked client, but something like ‚ÄúYandex.Money‚Äù? He used WM a lot, he stopped because monstrously uncomfortable. Well, compared to other services.</font></font></b> <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For your information: there is no ActiveX in the light version at all. There is a standard x.509 certificate, or enum. Or even just a login / password with confirmation of transfers via SMS. In your enlightened opinion, more than half of the 6 million registrations use this ‚Äúcrooked‚Äù client. If he does not suit you, we do not hold anyone by force. </font></font><br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">24. Do you feel any competition with Yandex.Money? Yes / No - and why? What payment systems in the CIS do you consider your competitors?</font></font></b> <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Yes, in terms of payments for goods and services. The reason is simple: Yandex is a large search engine, with all the attendant advantages, like a lot of search traffic. This is a good help for any service or project. In the CIS (again in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãpayment for services and the purchase of goods), our competitors are primarily Visa and Mastercard.</font></font><br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">25. Why there are no clear rules governing the work of WM-exchangers (electronic). Many people think that in the comments to the payment for withdrawal and input of amounts greater than 2000WMZ, it is necessary to indicate passport data. Where do the roots of this grow?</font></font></b> <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> There are clear rules, </font></font><a href="http://www.megastock.ru/Doc/exchange_agreement.aspx"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">here they are</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . </font></font><br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">26. A few questions. </font></font></b> <br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">a) Why is there no round-the-clock support? </font></font></b> <br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">b) Why are applications for arbitration considered for a long time? Ideally, the purse for which the complaint is received should be blocked for withdrawal of funds immediately after the submission of the claim, and the arbitration has to decide whether to unlock it or not. Accordingly, the hierarchy of the possibility of blocking the keeper must be respected. </font></font></b> <br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">c) Why can't I tie my card to the keeper?</font></font></b> <br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">d) Why does the system not have a common security system with other payment systems (this question would most likely be correctly asked at the conference of representatives of payment systems)? </font></font></b> <br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">e) How to connect your service to the system, and how realistic is it? </font></font></b> <br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A support may be sometimes slow, but in the end, they are satisfied with all the answers to commercial questions about the system.</font></font></b> <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> a) 24-hour support is. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">b) Ideally, everything is done this way (someone has already complained about superfast blocking in this thread). </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">c) It is possible, but not to the keeper, but to the WMID. But the card issued in the WM system. Read more on Cards.Webmoney.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">d) Everyone has different technologies, and each system has its own secrets, so there cannot be any unified service. But with leading global and Russian payment systems, we have telephone ‚Äúhotlines‚Äù for exchanging information about suspicious transactions. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">d) Actually, of course. For this we offer </font></font><a href="https://processing.webmoney.ru/"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">processing</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> service </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">. It allows you to work according to the usual agency scheme, even without registering with the System. This is an automated payment acceptance service with a withdrawal to your current account. There is another option - to install an </font></font><a href="https://merchant.webmoney.ru/conf/default.asp"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">interface</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> free of charge on your website </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">that allows you to receive WM.</font></font><br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">27. Why has WebMoney never had any serious problems with the law, despite the rather semi-legal position of the financial service? Why have these problems been and will be with all other financial firms in the Russian Federation, but not with WM? Who is the roof of this office with gigantic turnover and the dirtiest money you can even imagine?</font></font></b> <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> The myth of illegality and dirty money WM is one of the most ridiculous. Why do you think that solving problems with the law is possible only with the help of a ‚Äúroof‚Äù? There is a much more reliable way - to keep the law! WebMoney Transfer system operates legally, within the law and in compliance with all laws, and that's the whole secret. </font></font><br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">28. When will it be possible to withdraw more than $ 3000 a day from a banque card? Well, at least $ 10,000 is a normal limit.</font></font></b> <br><br>  Never.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The amounts you are talking about are peculiar mainly to business. And the product you mention is in principle not intended for business purposes. Try to conduct all transactions in the VM to avoid receiving cash, but if it doesn‚Äôt work out at all, then it is ONLY a withdrawal by bank transfer to your bank account. For the withdrawal of large sums only this option is possible. </font></font><br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">29. If I own a pirated game server and players pay for services via WebMoney, what can I do? For example, the monthly turnover of 100 thousand dollars. Will you check where this money comes from? Somewhere to go?</font></font></b> <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The user, participating in the WebMoney Transfer system, accepts the ‚ÄúAgreement on combating illegal trade, financial fraud and money laundering‚Äù. Therefore, if your activity is contrary to the rules of the System, sooner or later you will be denied service (regardless of your turnovers). In addition, in accordance with the law, we are obliged to provide the competent authorities with any requested information on transactions in the System. And in case we have enough information, we can stop processing the system participant transactions on our own initiative. </font></font><br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">30. In what cases can personal information, closed for public viewing, be transferred from WebMoney to third parties?</font></font></b> <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> In the case of a formal request from law enforcement agencies.</font></font><br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">31. I express my gratitude to the system for the efficiency in issuing a personal certificate. And the question for all the time of work arose the following: how do legal entities work with your system? Is it possible to find out more or less in detail about the scheme by which you can legally and safely withdraw funds to a legal entity account?</font></font></b> <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Here again, its own scheme for each type of title characters. It is best to contact the Guarantor for the title characters you are interested in. Their list is given above. For example, with WMR this is the case. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A user who wants to work in the system as a legal entity needs to conclude with LLC "Guarantee Agency" and sign in paper form (by mail) the "Agreement on the sale of securities". To get the contract form and information on its conclusion, you need to send a request to </font></font><a href="http://dealers%40guarantee.ru/"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">this e-mail</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">. More complete information </font></font><a href="http://www.guarantee.ru/Default.aspx%3Ftabid%3D147"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">is on the website of the</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> "Guarantee Agency". On the same site there is information on the reflection in accounting of operations in the WebMoney system, on the details of R and their financial and legal substantiation. </font></font><br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">32. Is it planned to introduce mandatory verification of all users of the system (passport data, contact information, etc.), which in my opinion would greatly reduce the possibility of using the system for fraudulent purposes?</font></font></b> <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> To date, for I / O funds in the system requires a certificate not lower than the formal, which involves the introduction of passport data. In addition, if you are a victim of fraud, there is an opportunity to file a complaint with the Arbitration or leave feedback about any user of the system.</font></font><br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">33. Excellent system, I have been using it for more than one year, but recently there was such a situation that my wallet in the system was hacked, restoring the wallet is still quite difficult and, in my opinion, a lengthy, complicated process, it might be better to ease this process, at least a little bit. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And another question is what the WebMoney expects in 2009, pessimistic rumors are circulating on the Internet, but I don‚Äôt want to give up the favorite system.</font></font></b> <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> The procedure is constantly undergoing changes, now everything is aimed at reducing the time required to complete the application and, if possible, do everything remotely (without notarial certification or the client‚Äôs going somewhere to the registrars, etc.).</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But in case there is a significant amount on the wallet, one cannot do without personal presence in spite of everything, and it is not yet possible to shorten this period. Although in the near future, in connection with the launch of a fingerprint recognition system, it will be possible to perform remote recovery even for business accounts with large amounts. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">As for the rumors, I don‚Äôt know what it is about, but I recommend not paying attention to them. 2009 has already begun, and, as you can see, with WebMoney everything is in order. </font></font><br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">34. How do you control employees of companies so that they do not enjoy privileges, I certainly understand that there is a system of logs, but what about those who control these logs? In general, how to organize the infrastructure so that there are no internal vulnerabilities?</font></font></b> <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Do you have an idle interest or do you want to create your own payment system? Or already created? Here comes to mind the analogy with the sellers of business packages with which we are fighting. Even those of them who write their business allowances to the CAM and, selling them, teach the business for the money of others, do not have this business. We have a diametrically opposite view on this topic. We do not want and will not teach third parties the nuances of our business. </font></font><br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">35. I created an account about 8 years ago, then, roughly speaking, I did not know about alternatives to Windows, so I put Classic on without a second thought, now I have to keep Windows almost on my computer just because of it.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Why is it done (or rather, why still remains) global separation into the Light and Classic versions? Why can't I manage the same WMID as it is convenient for me at the moment? Especially considering that the Classic version exists only for one OS.</font></font></b> <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Currently, </font></font><a href="https://security.webmoney.ru/asp/default.asp"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Security.Webmoney</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> is implementing a control panel for all 4 existing clients in the system with the establishment of trust, access rights, restrictions, and the ability to add management of currently unused clients over the existing VM-identifier. </font></font><br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">36. Is there a technical possibility to withdraw electronic money in an ordinary ATM? I think that in this case there would be much more customers.</font></font></b> <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Work on the search and implementation of banking products that meet the requirements of simple or remote opening of the card and allowing you to instantly replenish the card from the wallet is ongoing. As for the possibility of receiving cash in terminals or ATMs without a credit card, then the technology is also not standing still, and we are closely watching them. The biometric direction and authentication using a mobile phone are particularly promising today. For technologies that have received mass distribution, we will definitely offer our solutions. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Now the withdrawal of WM title units through an ATM is possible only by transferring to a plastic card and already from an ATM card. Details on the available products of instant output to the card can be read </font></font><a href="https://cards.webmoney.ru/"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">here</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> and </font></font><a href="https://banks.webmoney.ru/"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">here.</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">. </font></font><br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">37. From the amount of negativity, I was scorched. It is really not very clear where his SO MANY. I will not go into detailed reasoning, it is a long time, and hardly useful. I will confine myself to saying that everywhere there are pluses and minuses. Respect system for continuous and productive work on the level of security. </font></font></b> <br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I have a proposal of such a plan: to make the work of the financial support service more efficient. In my opinion, it is necessary that they work, if not 12 hours a day, and better around the clock, then at least on weekends and holidays. There are errors with vm-cards, and, even worse, problems with depositing money through the terminals, the solution of which is the responsibility of the fin. service. Imagine the situation: the mass of people can not make urgent payments, and fin. the service is down.</font></font></b> <br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A note to people who urgently brought all the money from the WM-purses, reading the comments, and not even trying to properly understand the situation: do you just believe what you write on the Internet?</font></font></b> <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> We have a slightly different view on similar proposals. We believe that it is more efficient to find opportunities to conduct your business using the System in such a way as not to depend on I / O methods and other factors that require the intervention of fin.</font></font> support<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And our main forces are directed precisely at creating self-regulating and automated systems and services that require minimal intervention of any kind of support. In general, the presence of any support is, of course, a necessary measure, but by and large a forced one. Unfortunately, the average level of IT education of our users is growing very slowly, but we are idealists and we believe that the time will come when any products on the web will be like the Ping team, excluding the existence of any support in principle.</font></font><br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">38. Sometimes television shows about the detention of various hackers. Do you know any precedents for the detention of hackers who are developing Trojans designed to steal money from wallets? If so, why is it not covered? If not, why not conduct such activities? I understand that the victim should turn, but not everyone will go to the police because of small amounts. There are various messages on the topic of ‚Äúscam‚Äù associated with the ‚Äúprize drawing‚Äù on the Runet‚Äôs open spaces. Is there any work with law enforcement in the direction of data capture woe to businessmen?</font></font></b> <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Cases like </font></font><a href="http://moneynews.ru/News/10798/"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">this</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">, already measured in dozens. They are covered, including in the relevant programs of central television, some in more detail, some less. And work in contact with law enforcement, of course, is ongoing and continuous. </font></font><br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">39. What is the commission for the withdrawal of WMZ through WM-banking to a bank currency account?</font></font></b> <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> The standard system fee is 0.8% (no more than 50WMZ) + bank interest 0.6% (min. 100 USD max. 600 USD) (http://www.wmtransfer.com/eng/about/fees/index.shtml) </font></font><br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">40. When will Webmoney enter accounting for all income and losses, and when will income taxation be?</font></font></b> <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> The question is not clear. Taxation of income involved in the relevant civil services, where you are required to file a declaration of income. You can read more about income accounting with WMR </font></font><a href="http://guarantee.ru/Portals/2/metod.pdf"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">here</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> .</font></font><br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">41. How can I withdraw Webmoney in Ukraine, to a card of a private bank, in a different way except Ukrwebmoney.Com with the lowest commission? </font></font></b> <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">WMU output methods can be </font></font><a href="https://banking.ukrgarant.com/"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">found here</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . </font></font><br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">42.

For them, aggregation is currently allowed (through independent intermediaries providing similar services), that is, Easypay.By users can purchase goods and services of WebMoney sellers and vice versa. As for allowing direct exchange, this is a matter of time. Now the rules for the exchange (limits, exchange without limits for certified users - users with an established identity, etc.) are developed and implemented, and the exchange will be allowed over time. </font></font><br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">43. Applied for restoration of control over the account. Passed all the procedures, sent a scan of the passport. On December 10, a letter was received that a passport scan was accepted and a new password will be sent within 20 days. How long to wait for the recovery? Can they refuse to refuse to recover and not warn about it?</font></font></b> <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Here you need to understand specifically. Give the number of the application for restoration - without this, nothing definite can be said. </font></font><br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">44. My main identifier has a seller certificate, I have checked passport data, respectively, the connection of the person and WMID is confirmed. I use Keeper Light.

Can I just come to your office, show my passport and ask me to send me a new certificate by e-mail?</font></font></b> <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> No, the recovery procedure must be completed anyway.
