However, the channels are still loaded, all the same content, because  video quality has also increased proportionally and weighs much more than before.  All TV channels are broadcast via the network. <br>  The battery capacity has increased 10 times, which made it possible to power the latest gadgets, although they themselves do not need to pull the entire load, cloud services have spread so much thanks to the expansion of communication channels that you can play the newest toy remotely without worrying about buying the latest video card. <br>  The number of new languages, libraries has grown so much that learning begins in kindergarten. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  2050 - Experiments with an optical transistor have borne fruit, the new optical processor is now powered by a laser, although it still contains a slow 100Gbit / s interface for communicating with slow electronic devices. <br>  The latest 1nm laser and fiber from modern materials allows you to combine optical processors into one large cluster and transfer data with virtually no delays.  Powerful desktops with kilowatt powers remain only with geeks.  Now you can connect to a cluster from a simple device and perform calculations, the power of which is limited only by your wallet. <br>  Finally, the volume of storage devices and the speed of calculations allows us to correctly recognize speech. <br>  The developers of programming languages ‚Äã‚Äãfinally merged, mainly due to the course of the new ruling party, all developments, crutches and libraries were destroyed (mainly due to the superhigh-speed virus) and a new language appeared, so understandable and logical that children could start programming their own toys

      2100 - Humanity has experienced several epidemics of viruses, completely maddening even modern opto-clusters, but the latest invention of a self-learning architecture of a crystal processor with a heuristic construction of optical communications allowed solving the problem of viruses and now there is a data center in every home. <br>  Problems arose with the transfer of data, because  Optical communication channels could not transfer all the memory dump necessary for the processor to function.  However, the nano-matrix allowed to store a copy of the entire global computing cluster in each geographic city, the exchange for synchronization was carried out via satellite communication through atmospheric lasers. <br>  Communication devices contained essentially only a flexible display, recharging, control was carried out completely remotely.  You can turn the matrix on the wall and make a cinema, you can wrap yourself around and completely immerse yourself in the gaming reality, and holographic projections began to replace partners in almost any activity. <br>  The heuristic computer finally allowed to get rid of the framework of programming languages, now it‚Äôs enough to say what you want. <br><br>  2200 - The speed of light was never conquered, the limits of calculations did not give rest to people, and the invention of the bioprocessor pushed humankind apart by a couple of orders of magnitude and allowed it to be implanted directly into the brain.  Now the computer was powered directly from its owner and transferred the results of the calculations directly to the brain.  It was not even necessary to turn a blind eye, the image of virtual reality was superimposed on the present, thanks to the most accurate position sensors. <br>  There is no need for numerous capricious input-output devices.  The entire data bank was also stored in the head using the backup neurons of the brain itself.  The usual verbal ways of communication of people began to die off as terribly slow.  Only a single geek programmers dictated their programs in the old-fashioned voice, although the transceiver of thought forms allowed downloading popular dumps of great people‚Äôs brains in seconds. <br><br>  2500 - Having reached the limit of its brain and having exhausted all natural resources, mankind returned to the caves, the biocomputer became so close to the brain that it was inherited, and the lost instructions for its modification did not allow it to be used to its full capacity, soon it was completely forgotten about it. then the genius invented the wheel, attached it to the wheelbarrow, and now it was possible to transport much more roots at a time than dragging their hands ... </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/111378/">https://habr.com/ru/post/111378/</a></p>
