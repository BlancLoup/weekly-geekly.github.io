  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Scholarships Do they need?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Write an article I was inspired by the phrase assistant to the President of the Russian Federation Arkady Dvorkovich, said in an online interview: <br><blockquote>  I will say an unpopular thing, but I think that this is correct: if we all believe that everything needs to be achieved through our own work, that work should become fashionable, then standard scholarships from students should be canceled, because this is the wrong signal that you get the very fact of your studies compensation.  You can work after school: in the department, in the library, in a cafe, making transfers, not money transfers, of course.  If a talented mathematician, he can work with his professor in the department, help him do research and get paid for it.  And if this is a future manager - maybe some kind of work in the company for two or three hours a day.  I agree that this is a two-way process, such opportunities should be formed at each university, the company should be interested in this.  These are all solvable problems.  I believe that it is both more correct and cheaper for taxpayers than to pay standard scholarships. <br><br>  I think it is absolutely the right system of educational loans.  Moreover, part of the money can be regarded as a scholarship.  But you must return this money after completing your studies.  That is to earn. </blockquote><br>  as was rightly noted yesterday in the comments to one of their articles, "apparently they are interested in how much patience the people have left." <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  To be honest, right after reading this news, something inside me cringed.  If we take into account the state of our education and science now, then if suddenly the scholarships are canceled, it will be a complete zvizdets. <br><br>  Immediately make a reservation, all that will be written below is not a complaint and do not cry.  It‚Äôs just one of the stories hundreds of thousands of whom are in the open spaces of our Motherland (yes, it‚Äôs the Motherland, not the ‚Äúfucking rashka‚Äù).

      After studying for 6 years in one of the best technical universities of the country, and then in his graduate school, I want to say that I could normally study only because I did not work outside the university at all, but on the contrary, starting from the 3rd year I was engaged in an internal project University and all of its time, Tortille to gain experience and knowledge.  I was not allowed to work by two factors: the presence of some kind, and scholarships (in addition, I received various nominal scholarships from the 3rd course) and sufficient earnings of the parents. <br><br>  After studying, I entered graduate school and realized that I had to move out from my parents and become independent and independent.  I moved to a rented apartment.  And here I was beaten by the truth of life.  A graduate student money is not enough.  This is logical: the scholarship graduate 1750r.  + assistant salary at the department of 8000r.  And the desire to ‚Äúwork for an idea‚Äù somehow passed away by itself.  I had to find a job outside the university, and given the fact that I became a good specialist, it was not a big deal.  As a result, I achieved quite a lot with my work (as quoted in the quotation), now I am completely independent of my parents, I recently bought a car, live with a beautiful girl, renting an apartment in the city center.  Do you think I defended my PhD and continued my studies? <br><br>  The essence of this story is this: if I had been paid a decent salary at the university and a decent scholarship, I would have remained in science and continued to work for the good of the Motherland.  And, probably, the country would receive one more quite good scientist. <br><br>  I believe that the abolition of scholarships will lead to a deterioration in the already deplorable situation in science.  After all, normal scholarships for students and graduate students allow them to think not about how to make money, but about how to solve this or that scientific problem.  And if a student is to work, then he can become a high-class specialist in his field, but he will never be an excellent scientist. <br><br>  By the way, in Western universities it is accepted that a student cannot work anywhere except in a university and a campus.  Our universities cannot afford to pay students decent salaries. <br><br>  PS: refer to the interview with Dvorkovich: <a href="http://www.gazeta.ru/interview/nm/s3488478.shtml">www.gazeta.ru/interview/nm/s3488478.shtml</a> <br><br>  PPS: I don‚Äôt think that I‚Äôll open someone‚Äôs eyes, but in our country there are fewer talented people who can and want to do science and work for the country, they just have to earn money now to ensure a decent life for themselves and their families. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/112186/">https://habr.com/ru/post/112186/</a></p>
