      In a <a href="https://habr.com/company/pt/blog/424975/">previous article,</a> we found out that events contain a lot of important information that cannot be lost in the normalization process.  The description of the interaction scheme refers to this kind of data.  To systematize the types of interaction, we did the following: <br><br><ul><li>  identified the main schemes inherent in any type of event; </li><li>  determined exactly which entities are involved in the schemes; </li><li>  formed a basic set of fields necessary to describe all the entities found in the original event and the channel of interactions between them. </li></ul><br>  As a result of analyzing the logs from various types of software and hardware, we were able to distinguish entities: Subject, Interaction Object, Source and Transmitter. <br><br>  Now let's talk about the semantics of the interaction of these entities and its reflection in the categorization of events.  Before describing the approach to the formation and the category, you need to answer two questions: why it is necessary to determine the categories of the event and what properties the catheterization system should have. <br><br>  To begin with, we will define why we need to categorize events.  In short: categorization is necessary in order to work equally with semantically similar events, regardless of the type of source.  To the types of sources we include the main purpose of the source: network equipment, operating systems, application software.  For the phrase ‚Äúto work in the same way with semantically similar events‚Äù it is necessary to understand the following: <br><br><ol><li>  Semantically similar events from any type of source have a common category. </li><li>  For events of each category, clear rules for filling in the fields of the scheme are defined.  So we effectively fight the chaos that occurs at the stage of normalization of events and often leads to multiple false positives correlation rules. </li><li>  Handling categories allows you to not make unnecessary checks in the code correlation rules to understand the semantics of the event.  For example, there is no need to check certain fields for data to determine that an event describes a user‚Äôs login, and not a system backup. </li><li>  Categorization is a common terminology base that helps when writing correlation rules and investigating incidents, to operate with a single set of terms and their common meanings.  For example, to clearly understand that changing the network configuration and changing the software configuration are completely different types of events that carry a completely different meaning. </li></ol><br>  To get all this, you need to create a system of event categorization and use it when writing correlation rules, investigating incidents, and in cases where more than one person works with an SIEM system. <br><a name="Requirements"></a><br>  With regard to the requirements for the system of categorization, it must satisfy four properties: <br><br><ol><li>  <b>Unambiguity</b> .  The same event should be assigned to one and only one category. </li><li>  <b>Compactness</b> .  The total number of categories should be such that they can be easily remembered by an expert. </li><li>  <b>Hierarchy</b>  The system should be built according to a hierarchical scheme and consist of several levels, since this is the most simple structure to memorize.  At the same time, the hierarchy should be based on the principle ‚Äúfrom the general to the particular‚Äù: at the first level there are more ‚Äúgeneral‚Äù categories, and at the last level - highly specialized ones. </li><li>  <b>Extensibility</b>  The principles on which it is built should allow to make updates to the categorization system when new types of events appear, requiring separate categories, without changing the basic approach. </li></ol><br>  Let us proceed to the description of the categorization system: let's start with two large domains, which include event sources connected to SIEM and in which they generate events. <br><br><a name="MainDomains"></a><h1>  Source and Event Domains </h1><br>  The introduction of SIEM often begins with the connection of sources that generate heterogeneous events.  An important feature of these events is that they reflect the functionality of the sources themselves. <br><br>  There are two global domains: <br><br><ol><li>  IT sources are system-wide application software and hardware that spawn IT events. </li><li>  IB sources - specialized software and hardware of the company's information security, generating IB events. </li></ol><br>  Consider the fundamental differences between the events of these domains. <br><br>  IT sources report the occurrence of any events in an automated system, without their assessment of the level of security - ‚Äúgood‚Äù or ‚Äúbad‚Äù.  Examples: applying a new device configuration, backing up data, transferring a file over the network, disabling the network port on the switch. <br><br>  Unlike IT sources, information security sources have additional external knowledge of how to interpret certain events from a security point of view, namely, policies.  Thus, the use of policies allows IB sources to make decisions - whether the observed phenomenon is ‚Äúgood‚Äù or ‚Äúbad‚Äù - and report this to the SIEM through the generated IB events. <br><br>  Consider the following example: Thus, in general, a neutral file transfer event over the network is regarded by the Next Generation level firewall as ‚Äúbad‚Äù: it turns out that the file is a Word document transmitted from the company's internal network to an external server via FTP, and the configured policy prohibits such informational interactions.  Disabling the network port is interpreted as an access violation by the decision to control the actions of administrators: since the port is disabled by the user Alex, who does not have rights to it, and occurs during his non-working time, according to the configured security policy. <br><br>  However, it is not quite true to say that information security sources generate only information security events.  IB sources generate IB and IT events.  IB sources generate IT events, as a rule, when they report changes in their state: configuration changes, cluster nodes switching, backup.  In general, these events can be attributed to the internal audit of actions and the status of the source.  At the same time, when activity concerns the application of security policies, the same source already generates information security events, thereby reporting the results of their application. <br><br>  We deliberately described in such detail the differences between the two domains.  The events of each domain carry their own meaning and, at times, can fundamentally differ from each other.  These differences led to the existence of two separate event categorization systems responsible for IT events and information security events. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/lh/q6/2j/lhq62jphooh6zal7eks_kohztki.png" alt="Categorization of events.  Event domains"><br>  <i>Event Domains</i> <br><br>  There is one more rare type of sources that generate events of a separate, third domain ‚Äî the domain of attacks.  Events of this domain can be received from the endpoint protection level sources (Endpoint Protection), other downstream SIEM (if they are arranged in a hierarchy), or other solutions that can determine from the analysis of IT and (or) information security events that an automated system or its part is under attack. <br><br>  As part of this series of articles, we will use the following concepts when separating attacks and information security events from final protections: <br><br><ol><li>  Attack - the malicious sequence of actions of the attacker, aimed at achieving a specific goal within the company. </li><li>  An attack can consist of one or several events - chains of information security events and / or IT events that are violations of information security policies. </li></ol><br>  There are several approaches to categorizing attacks, for example, <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/">MITRE Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge (ATT &amp; CK)</a> , which is gaining popularity, but we will not discuss this domain in our articles. <br><br><a name="ITCategorization"></a><h1>  The system of categorization of IT events </h1><br>  System-wide application software and hardware, which we refer to as IT-sources of events, is designed to implement or support certain processes to perform its tasks.  In the course of solving them, the committed facts are recorded by separate IT events.  They can be attributed to the process in which each of them occurred. <br><br>  By highlighting the processes occurring in IT sources, it is possible to form the first level of categorization (later we will call it a context).  It will define a semantic field that allows you to correctly interpret IT events. <br><br>  When analyzing events, it becomes clear that each of them describes the interaction of several entities within an already defined process.  Selecting as the main one of these entities as an object of interaction, we form the second level of categorization. <br><br>  The nature of the behavior of the main entity in an event within a specific process will play the role of the third level of categorization of IT events. <br>  Total, at the output we got the following levels: <br><br><ol><li>  The context (process) within which the event occurred. </li><li>  The object (main entity) described by the event. </li><li>  The behavior of the object within a given context. </li></ol><br>  Thus, we have formed three levels of categorization of IT-events, allowing to conveniently operate on semantically similar events from different types of sources in the IT-infrastructure. <br><br>  To ensure the unambiguity of the resulting categorization system, we will form separate domains at each level. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/yj/8h/qo/yj8hqoi_fevntq2utkvczwh5g_o.png" alt="Categorization of IT events.  First level."><br>  <i>The system of categorization of IT-events.</i>  <i>First level.</i> <br><br>  A similar process approach to working with IT systems is used in ITSM (IT Service Management, management of IT services), which postulates some of the basic processes that take place in IT services.  We will rely on this approach in the formation of possible processes, or in another way - contexts, when considering IT sources of events. <br><br>  Select the main processes at this level: <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Business Continuity Management</b> (operations continuity management) - events associated with operations to maintain continuous operation of systems: the processes of replication, migration and synchronization of virtual machines, databases and storage, backup and restore operations; </li><li>  <b>Users And Rights Management</b> (management of users and rights) - events associated with working with groups and user accounts; </li><li>  <b>Access Management</b> - events related to the processes of Authentication, Authorization, Accounting (AAA) and any attempts to access the system; </li><li>  <b>Availability Management</b> - events associated with any actions to start, stop, turn on, turn off, interrupt the operation of entities, including informational messages from the systems for monitoring accessibility of the entity; </li><li>  <b>Deployment Management</b> (management of deployment) - events associated with the introduction of new entities into the system from the outside, as well as with the removal of the entity from this system; </li><li>  <b>Network Interaction Management</b> (network interaction management) - events associated with the transfer of data through the network, including the establishment of connections, opening and closing of tunnels; </li><li>  <b>Network Management</b> - network stack related events: including any actions with policies and network filtering rules; </li><li>  <b>Virtual Infrastructure Management</b> ( <b>Virtual Infrastructure Management</b> ) - events related to the virtualization infrastructure; </li><li>  <b>Database Management</b> (database management) - events related to the functioning of the DBMS and the actions of users and processes in it; </li><li>  <b>System Management</b> (system management) - events associated with the operation of the operating system and software, which is part of the operating system; </li><li>  <b>Generic Application Management</b> (management of other applications) - events related to the operation of other applications installed by the user and not part of the OS. </li></ul><br>  It is important to understand that different processes can occur on the same IT source.  For example, in a DHCP service deployed in Unix OS, both the Network Management process can occur (generating, for example, an update event of the IP address of the nodes), and the System Management process, generating a service restart event or configuration file parsing errors. <br><br><h2>  The second level of categorization of IT events (entities) </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/k_/rn/s6/k_rns6dddokqnddjqsdz9kjfdnk.png" alt="System for categorizing information security events.  The first and second levels."><br>  <i>System for categorizing information security events.</i>  <i>The first and second levels.</i> <br><br>  The second level reflects the interaction object described in the event.  Note that the event can describe several entities.  For example, take the following event: ‚Äúthe user sent a request to issue a personal certificate to the certification server‚Äù.  In events of this kind, it is necessary to choose one, the main entity as an object of interaction, which is central to the event.  Here we can determine that the main entity is a ‚Äúrequest to the certification server‚Äù, since the user is obviously the subject of the interaction, and the personal certificate is the result of the interaction of the subject and the object.  By collecting and analyzing a large array of events, you can select groups of entities: <br><br><ul><li>  <b>identifying</b> : user account, user group, certificate - entities that allow you to identify the user or the system; </li><li>  <b>executables</b> : an application, an executable module ‚Äî everything that can be started by the operating system and contains a specific algorithm; </li><li>  <b>rules and policies</b> : any rules, access policies, including Windows OC group policies; </li><li>  <b>information storage entities in the OS</b> : file, registry key, directory group object ‚Äî everything that can act as a repository of application-level information; </li><li>  <b>network connections</b> : sessions, flows (flows), tunnels - entities that carry data flow from one node to another; </li><li>  <b>entities of network identification of a node</b> : network address, socket, the network node itself - all those entities without which no monitoring system can do; </li><li>  <b>Network L5-L7</b> : mailing, media stream, distribution list - entities that transmit information at the L5-L7 levels of the OSI model; </li><li>  <b>service network</b> : DNS zone, routing table.  These entities are responsible for the correct functioning of the network, without carrying a payload for the end user; </li><li>  <b>entities of fault-tolerant configurations</b> : RAID, cluster network elements; </li><li>  <b>entities of virtualization systems</b> : virtual machines, virtual hard disks, virtual machine snapshots; </li><li>  <b>database entities</b> : tables, databases, DBMS; </li><li>  <b>physical equipment</b> : connected devices, access control elements (turnstiles, IP cameras); </li><li>  <b>other operating system entities</b> : a command in the management console, a system console, a system log ‚Äî those operating system entities that do not fit into other categories; </li><li>  <b>other network entities</b> : network interface, public network resource - those network subsystem entities that do not fit into other categories. </li></ul><br>  These groups do not claim to be comprehensive, but cover the main tasks for assigning second-level categories.  If necessary, the presented groups can be expanded. <br><br><h2>  The third level of categorization of IT-events (the nature of the interaction) </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/x5/wc/ja/x5wcja8h3u9jrersnj_au4im9ke.png" alt="The system of categorization of IT-events.  The first, second and third levels."><br>  <i>The system of categorization of IT-events.</i>  <i>The first, second and third levels.</i> <br><br>  Within the framework of a specific process, the nature of the behavior of the main entity can be reduced to the following values: <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Control</b> - interaction that affects the functioning of the entity; </li><li>  <b>Communication</b> - communication between entities; </li><li>  <b>Manipulation</b> - actions to work with the entity itself, including the manipulation of its data; </li><li>  <b>Embedding</b> - interaction, as a result of which a new entity is added to the context (or the entity is removed from the context); </li><li>  <b>State</b> - informational events about changes in the state of an entity. </li></ul><br>  The latter domain stands out among others: it includes events that actually do not describe any interaction, but contain information about the entity or transitions of the entity between states.  For example, an event describing only the current state of the system (about the current system time, a change in the state of a product license). <br><br>  Events describe not only the interaction itself, but also its result.  It is important to understand that the context, the main essence, the nature of the object's behavior within the context does not depend on the result of the interaction.  As a result, there can be ‚Äúsuccess‚Äù and ‚Äúfailure‚Äù.  The event can also describe the ongoing process of the still incomplete interaction.  Let's call this status ‚Äúcurrent‚Äù. <br><br><h2>  Formation of a data set based on three levels </h2><br>  For each domain of each level, you can select a specific set of data containing events. <br><br>  Let us examine an example of an event: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/0j/e6/so/0je6sogj5o9rk3dbfr4qjylafac.png"><br><br>  It can be interpreted as "the connection from node 10.0.1.5 to node 192.168.149.2 was broken."  Looking at the context of the event, you can see that it describes the network connection.  Accordingly, we fall into the context of "Network Interaction Management". <br><br>  Next, we define the main entity in the event.  It is obvious that the event describes three entities: two nodes and a network connection.  Based on the above recommendations, we understand that the main entity in this case is the network connection, and the nodes are the participants of the interaction, the endpoints that perform actions on the entity.  Total we get the main entity from the "Network Connections" domain, and the action performed on the entity - "closing the communication channel", which can be attributed to the Communication domain. <br><br>  However, we still have quite a lot of data that could be saved from the event.  So, the second level entity set ‚ÄúNetwork Connections‚Äù has common properties: <br><br><ul><li>  connection initiator (address + port + interface); </li><li>  recipient (target) of the connection (address + port + interface); </li><li>  the protocol by which the connection is made. </li></ul><br>  Also, for example, the action of the third level of categorization ‚Äúconnection closure‚Äù, belonging to the Communication domain, may contain the following data, regardless of what kind of connection was closed and what source informed about it: <br><br><ul><li>  the number of bytes sent / sent; </li><li>  the number of packets sent / sent; </li><li>  duration </li></ul><br>  Another example is the set of basic entities ‚ÄúEntities of information storage in the OS‚Äù, which are characterized by the following data: <br><br><ul><li>  entity name; </li><li>  path location of the entity in the OS; </li><li>  entity size; </li><li>  entity access privileges. </li></ul><br>  The set of actions related to this entity, for example, ‚Äúcopying‚Äù, which is included in the third level domain ‚ÄúManipulation‚Äù, can be characterized by the following properties: <br><br><ul><li>  new entity name; </li><li>  new path location of the entity; </li><li>  new entity access privileges. </li></ul><br>  Optionally, we can get all this data from the event.  The main thing is that the category we have defined allows us to isolate a specific set of data that can be extracted from an event, knowing in advance that these data will be semantically similar. <br><br>  And in this respect, categories become a convenient tool.  By comparing each level of domains with a specific set of such data, we are able to save semantically similar data into the same fields of a normalized event, regardless of the manufacturer and model of the source of the event.  This greatly simplifies the search for data in a large volume of events, and, consequently, the implementation of correlations for such events. <br><br><h2>  Examples of use of the categorization system </h2><br>  <b>Situation 1:</b> It is necessary to find all the events that describe the connection and disconnection of peripheral devices from any sources. <br><br>  Each of the sources generates events, after normalization of which the <b>Level 1</b> (first level of categorization), <b>Level 2</b> (second level) and <b>Level 3</b> (third level) fields contain categories.  In the described situation, all events of interest will contain categories: <br><br><ul><li>  Level 2: <b>Physical equipment;</b> </li><li>  Level 3: <b>Embedding.</b> </li></ul><br>  The first-level domain is not so important, since operations with equipment can occur in different contexts. <br><br>  Thus, to display the required events, it is enough to write the following query: <br><br><pre><code class="sql hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">Select</span></span> * <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">from</span></span> <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">events</span></span> <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">where</span></span> Level2 = ‚Äú&lt;      &gt;‚Äù <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">and</span></span> Level3 = ‚ÄúEmbedding‚Äù <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">and</span></span> <span class="hljs-built_in"><span class="hljs-built_in">time</span></span> <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">between</span></span> (&lt; &gt;)</code> </pre> <br>  <b>Situation 2:</b> It is necessary to find all the events that describe the attempt to modify the filesystem objects with the name beginning with ‚Äúboot‚Äù. <br><br>  Sources connected to the SIEM can produce completely different file modification events.  However, assigning appropriate categories to events allows you to select the necessary from the entire array: <br><br><ul><li>  Level 1: <b>System Management;</b> </li><li>  Level 2: <b>Entities for storing information in the OS;</b> </li><li>  Level 3: <b>Manipulation.</b> </li></ul><br>  In addition, a condition is specified by file name: using predefined datasets, we can expect that for this category the file name will be in the object.name field.  Therefore, to select events, you can form the following request: <br><br><pre> <code class="sql hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">Select</span></span> * <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">from</span></span> <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">events</span></span> <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">where</span></span> Level1 = ‚Äú<span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">System</span></span> <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">Management</span></span>‚Äù <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">and</span></span> Level2 = ‚Äú&lt;        &gt;‚Äù <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">and</span></span> Level3 = ‚ÄúManipulation‚Äù <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">and</span></span> (object.name <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">like</span></span> ‚Äúboot.%‚Äù)</code> </pre> <br>  If the entity was copied, we will find information about it and that it was copied from another entity - this will give impetus to further investigation. <br><br>  <b>Situation 3:</b> It is necessary to provide simple profiling of network connections on the border routers of various manufacturers installed in the company's branches.  SIEM receives events from each of these border routers. <br><br>  Each of the routers generates IT events, after normalization of which there are categories in the Level 1, Level 2, Level 3 fields.  In the described example, for profiling it is necessary and sufficient to analyze the events about opening and closing of network connections.  According to the presented categorization system, such events will contain the following category fields: <br><br><ul><li>  Level 1: <b>Network Interaction Management;</b> </li><li>  Level 2: <b>Network Connections;</b> </li><li>  Level 3: <b>Communication.</b> </li></ul><br>  Additionally, for opening and closing operations, you can specify the ‚Äúopen‚Äù and ‚Äúclose‚Äù actions, as well as the status of the ‚Äúsuccess‚Äù action. <br><br>  In addition, having data sets for each of the category levels, you can be sure that the start of this connection will be recorded in the event of opening a connection, and the event of closing the connection will contain information about the nodes participating in the network interaction, as well as in the fields ‚ÄúThe number of transmitted bytes‚Äù, ‚Äúthe number of transmitted packets‚Äù and ‚Äúduration‚Äù will be placed corresponding data on the duration of the connection and the amount of transmitted information, respectively. <br><br>  Thus, filtering the flow of events by the specified categories and actions, you can select only the necessary events for the profiling operation, without the need to specify a list of specific event identifiers. <br><br><h1>  System for categorizing information security events </h1><br>  Before we talk about the system of categorization, we note that we will consider only the events coming from the means of protection.  Categorizing hacker attacks, as chains of malicious actions, is a separate area with its own categorization system. <br><br>  The system of categorizing information security events is based on a certain paradigm.  It is formulated as follows: any incident that occurs in an automated system is reflected in one or several environments at once: the level of a particular host, the level of the network, the level of the physical environment. <br><br>  Remedies operating at these levels reveal the incident or its ‚Äúechoes‚Äù and generate information security events that arrive at the entrance to the SIEM. <br><br>  For example, the transfer of a malicious file over the network to a specific host can be detected at the network and host levels, while network traffic is being processed by network protection tools or by analyzing memory areas with the corresponding anti-virus protection modules. <br><br>  Unauthorized physical access to the premises can be detected at the physical environment level by means of access control systems and at the host level, by means of GIS from unauthorized access when authorizing a user to a host during off hours. <br><br>  When dealing with security events, it is often necessary to understand the environment in which the incident was recorded.  And proceeding from this, build a further path of investigation or form the logic of the correlation rule.  Thus, the detection environment is the first level of the categorization system. <br><br><h2>  The first level of the system of categorizing information security events </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ig/ay/vz/igayvzurcou73lz_txlya7rqyya.png" alt="System for categorizing information security events.

a system for categorizing events and put forward </font></font><a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/pt/blog/432352/"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">requirements</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> that defined the approaches and principles of its formation. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Based on the specifics of the sources of events connected to the SIEM, the categorization system was divided into two directions: the categorization of events from IT sources and the categorization of events from information security sources. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The IT event categorization system was formed on the basis of the following principles:</font></font><br><br><ol><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> IT events reflect the stages or details of IT processes that are supported or implemented by event sources. </font></font></li><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> The categorization system consists of 3 basic levels and one additional, determining the success or non-success of the action described in the event. </font></font></li><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> At the first level, IT processes are distinguished within which the source of events operates. </font></font></li><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> The second level describes the main entities that are involved in this process. </font></font></li><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> The third level determines what actions are performed by this or on this entity in the framework of the process. </font></font></li><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> An additional level describes the status of these actions (success, failure). </font></font></li></ol><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> The system of categorizing information security events is based on the following principles: </font></font><br><br><ol><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The categorization applies exclusively to information security events collected from protection tools and does not affect the categorization of attacks on automated systems. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The differences between attacks and information security events were given at the beginning of the article.</font></font></li><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> The categorization system consists of 3 levels. </font></font></li><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> At the first level, there are domains in which violations of information security can be detected: violations of the host level, network and physical environment. </font></font></li><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> The second level of categorization is formed by concrete classes of violations. </font></font></li><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> The third level is formed by specific types of violations defined within the framework of a given class. </font></font></li></ol><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The article also gave examples of the use of this categorization system when writing correlation rules and investigating incidents. </font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/_z/3m/ah/_z3mahc8mgidrucoua4fzcbwmgq.png" alt="   "><br>

already been described and will show how to approach the normalization of events from the standpoint of unification. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Its application eliminates the correlation rules from errors in the data received in them in the form of normalized events, thereby increasing their accuracy.</font></font><br><br><hr><br> <b><font style="vertical-align:
