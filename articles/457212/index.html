I present to you the translation of the article <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/why-you-are-never-too-old-to-learn-java-or-any-programming-language-a62603e89448/">‚ÄúWhy you are never to learn Java (or any programming language)‚Äù</a> by John Selawsky. <br><blockquote>  Love for all ages. </blockquote>  Despite the fact that many people agree with this phrase, I constantly observe how people drive themselves into imaginary frames and convince them that it is too late to learn something new or change their profession.  Why don't we use this approach to everything that we would like to achieve, especially when it comes to learning something new, for example, a programming language? <br><br>  I am a Java lecturer and I have examples of many people who started learning Java at the age of 30 or even older.  In fact, as they age, people become more experienced and wise, they see things differently, they are ‚Äúlike a fish in water‚Äù in any new endeavors.  In addition, IT has less ageism (from translation. - Ageism - discrimination of a person based on his age) than in other industries.  This industry values ‚Äã‚Äãskills, not the age of a programmer. <br><br>  Here you will find <b>5 compelling arguments</b> why you should not neglect your desires and you should start learning Java.  These reasons apply to other programming languages.

    <h3>  Reason 1. Knowledge of the new, helps your "processor" not to fail </h3><br>  Believe it or not, but recent medical research by <i><a href="https://www.metrohealthinc.com/living-younger/the-importance-of-learning-something-new-as-you-age/">Cesar Quililan has</a></i> proven how brain activity affects aging and brain health.  It turned out that the more you train your brain, the better it is. <br><br>  They showed how people aged 60 to 90 years, improved their health and brain condition, just doing handicrafts (from translation. - for example, knitting, promotes brain coordination, improves motor skills, etc.) several hours a day .  Now imagine what the brain of a 30 year old man is capable of. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Learning a programming language is tantamount to training your thought processes - mental training, thanks to which your attention and concentration will be much better. <br>  An example of a success story of a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/34r807/im_32_years_old_and_just_started_my_first/">32 year old person</a> .  He did not know anything about programming or any technical things, he now studies programming at the university, and says that when he started it was quite difficult, but now his brain is ‚Äúsharp as a razor‚Äù.  In addition, no one cares about his age. <br><br><h3>  Reason 2. There is a bunch of online courses and material - no one will see your age. </h3><br>  Nowadays there are many online courses and many people recognize that they are more effective than offline projects and bring more positive results.  The reasons are simple: the IT industry values ‚Äã‚Äãyour knowledge, not physical abilities, and you choose for yourself the right time and pace for studying.  There are many stories about people who successfully passed them and got the job of their dreams in a very short period of time. <br><br><h4>  Here are three prime examples of Internet resources where you can learn Java: </h4><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://codegym.cc/">CodeGym</a> (also <a href="https://javarush.ru/">known</a> as <a href="https://javarush.ru/">JavaRush</a> ) is an online course on Java programming, <br>  which is 80% of practice; </li><li>  <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/">Code Academy</a> - this program will help you in acquiring technical skills that will be very useful in your future work; </li><li>  In addition, there are online video courses on <a href="https://www.coursera.org/">Coursera</a> or <br>  <a href="https://www.udemy.com/">Udemy</a> - platforms that include courses from online universities from around the world, in various subjects. </li></ul><br>  As soon as you begin to study or work as a programmer, for sure, many will need mentoring support from those who are already a specialist in YaP Java.  In addition, the Java community of developers is very well developed, here are some platforms that will help you find the necessary information or ask for practical advice: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="http://www.javaprogrammingforums.com/">Java Forum</a> is a classic forum that includes many topics and subsections for quick search; </li><li>  <a href="https://www.javaworld.com/">Java wold</a> is a platform where news, blogs, experts and many things related to Java are based in one place; </li><li>  <a href="https://codegym.cc/help">CodeGym Help</a> (also known as JavaRush) is a newbie community where they can find quick and proper support. </li></ul><br><h4>  Places where you can ask any question and find one or more solutions from users: </h4><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/learnjava/">Java subreddit:</a> sharing solutions and experiences on issues and topics related to Java; </li><li>  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/">Programming subreddit:</a> query and search for solutions to any programming problem. </li></ul><br><h4>  Blogs are also important - they keep track of updates, new features and, as a rule, those that have recently been added or created for more convenient writing of Java programs: </h4><br><ul><li>  <a href="http://www.thejavageek.com/core-java/">Java Geek:</a> is a source where you can find a clear explanation of a particular case or issue, moreover, it is divided into categories - interaction with various technologies; </li><li>  <a href="http://www.benchresources.net/">Bench Resources:</a> another source for Java problems and cases.  Its structure is also divided into sections for quick retrieval. </li></ul><br>  And of course, never forget about another important source of knowledge - books.  In addition, as soon as you become a programmer, after a long working day at the computer, you will want to change the computer screen to something else: <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Learning Java.</b>  <b>Cathy Sierra and Bert Bates.</b>  The authors are trying to convey their knowledge using simple language and visual content, not stopping at how difficult it is to learn OOP. </li><li>  <b>Java.</b>  <b>Beginner's Guide</b>  <b>Herbert Shildt.</b> Describes the basics of <b>Java</b> gradually, allowing the reader to understand and dive into Java from the very beginning. <br></li></ul><br>  As you have noticed, there are many online resources, and this is not all.  So what stops you so as not to start learning Java right now, with such huge support behind your back?  By the way, they do not care about your age, only your knowledge. <br><br><h3>  Reason 3. Age does not matter </h3><br>  Age is just a figure ... of your level.  Unfortunately, there is a global stereotype and misconception that you should have only one specialty for the rest of your life.  But who said that it should be?  You are an adult who knows what he is looking for and what results he wants.  That is why, as soon as you decide that you want to write code - develop this spark, and, sooner or later, it will flare up. <br><br>  Another motivation is to think about yourself and never compare yourself with someone else, because people have different experiences and different levels of knowledge.  The starting point should be what you knew before you started learning.  You will be surprised comparing your progress with the previous stage.  There is a great example of a programmer from my course who has never had a job related to technical skills.  But he decided, step by step, to take courses on <i>CodeGym</i> <i>(JavaRush)</i> and you know what?  He succeeded and got the job he wanted.  And never be afraid of ‚Äúbad code‚Äù or lack of experience, because at any age we all make mistakes at the beginning, and they gradually disappear as you hone your skills.  Did you know that junior students are worried just like senior students?  Will I find work without work experience?  The truth is that some companies are looking for people with minimal experience in order to grow specialists from them for their projects.  In addition, technologies are evolving every day, and they require a lot of code, and those who can create it.  You can not learn everything :) <br><br><h3>  Reason 4. Learning Java is like learning any other skill. </h3><br>  Learning Java is no different from, say, learning to ride a bike.  The differences are not great.  However, if you start learning to ride a bike at a mature age, you will naturally worry, and yet you will spend less time on it.  Age plays an important role, your wisdom and experience will help you correct the mistakes that will occur in the process. <br><br>  Programming is not only coding, but also finding the best way to solve the problem you are facing.  And here your experience can help a lot.  Thus, having experience in another field is a huge advantage.  And many who have already taken the initial steps recognize that their experience has helped them achieve success. <br><br><h3>  Reason 5. Now is the right time. </h3><br>  Never delay what you plan, start learning as soon as possible, because the right time may never come.  If you wait, then you are missing your precious time.  In addition, later in life you will have even more doubts than now, and it will be more difficult to start. <br><br>  In addition, you will have new opportunities with the help of which you will be able to improve current work, get promoted or even change jobs.  Isn't it attractive?  Reddit makes it easy to find the story of a 30 year old who has traveled a thorny path while working with young programmers.  It made him stronger, and he got the job even easier than he expected. <br><br><h3>  In conclusion </h3><br>  If you are one of those who are at a crossroads, thinking: ‚ÄúI am too old for something new,‚Äù you should know that age is just a consequence of time, which also helps you to see what you don‚Äôt usually see. young people. <br><br>  Learning something new will keep your mental health in order, and your mental acuity will not yield to those younger than you. <br><br>  Therefore, studying Java, at home or online, is just another great opportunity to show everyone that you can do something else.  Accept this as getting another vital skill.  In addition, no one will care how old you are, because the IT industry is knowledge. <br><br>  Thus, never give up on your idea and just start moving forward.  Be sure that you always get great support, no matter what path you choose. <br><br>  It's never too late to start learning Java or anything, because the earlier you start to learn, the more privileges you‚Äôll get from life - just start!  ( <i>Just do it</i> ) <br><br>  In addition, practice and knowledge will allow you to increase your abilities, and then you will definitely become an even more successful person. <br><br>  So if you think you're too old for that ... <br>  - this is not true. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/457212/">https://habr.com/ru/post/457212/</a></p>
