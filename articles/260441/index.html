  <section class="page js-page"><h1>New hubs. What do I need and what do everyone need?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Having made my first post that received an invite for me, I decided that I would write a post a week, but did not grow together.  And several times it was due to the fact that there were no suitable hubs for the selected topic.  And what to do?  My competences and questions of interest lie at the intersection of the management and marketing of Internet advertising technologies (not the advertising itself, but technologies), and from some angle I proudly consider myself a "technical person."  But I cannot share it in a professional environment simply because there were no hubs.  Well, we will look for workarounds =) <br><br>  First of all, I want to say that in my opinion, the stories cited relate to a significant number of Internet specialists, so I will begin with them. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  <b>The story is one.</b>  There are such statistics systems as Google. Analytics and Yandex. Metrics.  They are very functional, widely distributed and solve the pressing issues of advertisers, simple site administrators, marketers, analysts and other representatives of the Internet ecosystem.  But!  There are a couple of points that cause both questions and bewilderment.  Let's start with Google.  There is such functionality as UTM-tags that allow you to split incoming traffic and analyze it.  Everything looks good, except for one moment that the specialists could not clarify to me.  Traffic from different channels and with a different set of characteristics can be equipped with the same UTM tag.  This can happen either by accident or by malicious intent.  But to divide it back is not possible.  Thus, we may face an unpleasant situation when, in order to save the budget, an unscrupulous contractor lets two or more channels through the same set of tags, misleading both the system and the customer.  This question is solved in the Metric very simply - you can make a report with the intersection of traffic sources and tags.  Why this is not in Analytics - a mystery.  But that is why I personally recommend using both statistics collection systems.

      <b>The story is one "a."</b>  There is a great tool in Metric - a report on bots and the ratio of total traffic by day.  But!  There is no way to see the report with the intersection of bots by traffic sources.  It is not possible to even make such a report yourself in the designer.  I don‚Äôt even need to explain the consequences.  But how it would be convenient to see the number of bots for each source, especially if you are purchased in teaser, CPA and contextual advertising. <br><br>  I thought to publish this topic in the respective hubs, but there were none.  And what hubs are you missing? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/260441/">https://habr.com/ru/post/260441/</a></p>
