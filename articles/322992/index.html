Since both options do not suggest diversity, then, accordingly, the results will be far from expected.  Therefore, we tried to create a completely new product for the market and simulate a full-fledged lesson, during which a student will be able to get all the necessary knowledge and strengthen his skills without a teacher. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  This is the first "publication" of our school product.  In the future, we plan to refine and improve the course, invent new learning opportunities and select materials of different levels.  Therefore, now we need an honest feedback about the course, content, design and gamification.  We ask you to register, test your knowledge and pump English through our course.  And after the end of the course send us your feedback on all stages. <br><br>  <b>We give you access for a year to the English course "Online Course".</b>  <b>To gain access, simply follow the link and after applying the promo code, register by clicking on the <a href="https://www.englishdom.com/myprofile/purchases/habra12/%3Futm_medium%3Dblog%26utm_source%3Dhabrahabr">link</a> .</b>

      So that you can quickly understand the structure of the proposed course, we offer you a small instruction that will allow you to engage in learning more effectively. <br><br>  In developing our course, we first of all tried to solve the main problem of online services - the rapid loss of interest in learning and, as a result, a decrease in student motivation (according to our surveys of students of online schools, after 3-4 months the student quits classes). <br><br>  <i>Briefly about the course:</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>‚óè The system provides the following levels of difficulty: English for beginners (Elementary), conversational (Pre-Intermediate), intermediate (Intermediate) + Upper-Intermediate (above average).</i> <i><br></i>  <i>‚óè Each level consists of 25 lessons: 25 topics on grammar + topics on vocabulary in conjunction with the subsequent complication;</i> <i><br></i>  <i>‚óè The main principle is structure, practice and consolidation.</i>  <i>The student learns the material in different contexts, repeating it several times, as a result bringing the acquired skills to automatism.</i>  <i>As practice shows, this approach allows to achieve the best results, moreover, it is no worse than in the classroom with a real teacher.</i> <br><br>  We start the dive!  You are already waiting for the first lesson with a list of tasks. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/025/26f/949/02526f9492134d17a56922edcd83e95b.png"><br><br>  <b>Vocabulary</b> <br><br>  Let's look at the dictionary, which offers a list of thematic words for study. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/db7/b2c/55c/db7b2c55cfdd4b98816bcd0949537fa6.png"><br><br>  The content is selected so that the words given at the beginning of the lesson are repeated throughout the session and used later in other topics.  Each word is accompanied by translation, transcription and image - all this helps to highlight the speech construct in memory, associating it with the necessary association. <br><br>  The ‚ÄúTrain‚Äù button opens a page with a new task: you need to spell a word, select or enter the correct translation.  Each correct answer increases the level of progress, while the words learned will not disappear anywhere: you will repeat them in the following stages, and so on until full inclusion in the active vocabulary. <br><br>  <b>Theory</b> <br><br>  The theory is a grammatical part that allows you to sort through the database and fill in the gaps.  The concept of the material is strictly structured and metered, and the flow is maximally simplified and accessible, so as not to be confused in unnecessary terminology.  This allows the student, without being overloaded with information, to gain real knowledge, but not a headache. <br><br>  During each lesson, students should learn a small and clear rule.  The text is accompanied by examples and supplemented with a video explaining the real teacher. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/463/a2c/543/463a2c543fb84e11af20d2e2dc71556a.png"><br><br>  <b>Practice</b> <br><br>  After theory, go to Practice!  Exercises to strengthen grammar and vocabulary from the lesson.  There are three types - enter the missing words, choose the correct option and translate the sentence using special blanks.  These types of tasks help to memorize grammar, as well as to repeat the written language and more correctly use separate meanings of words.  All exercises are complemented by audio tracks so that you hear the correct pronunciation of words and memorize them. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4b7/0d7/b8d/4b70d7b8d1dd4727a4416c31efc46697.png"><br><br>  After passing you will see your results in the form of progress, having gained experience points, and sentences in which mistakes were made can be re-executed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ecd/f39/1bf/ecdf391bfb6c478491cb21a07381136e.png"><br><br>  <b>Life story</b> <br><br>  One of the ways to replace the routine work with the text is the section Life story.  We tried to simulate up to five different workouts, allowing to dive to the maximum in the language environment, rather than boredom.  All material is taken from various sources - popular movies and TV shows, interesting books, modern songs - and touches the most varied life situations from simple and ordinary to the most incredible and distant from everyone the usual "London is the capital of Great Britain". <br><br>  The teachers carefully worked out the content, highlighting grammatical structures and phrases for memorization, which are absorbed in the exercises after the text.  The list of tasks is quite varied - fill in the blanks, put the events in the correct sequence, or guess how truthfully several sentences are set out in relation to the video or text.  As a result, all the material is interesting to read and easy to remember.  No boring textbook texts! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d47/c56/67c/d47c5667c1b14766a7a49103053033ab.png"><br><br>  <b>Phrasebook</b> <br><br>  To effectively memorize phrases and sentences you need a special tool - Phrasebook.  Any skill needs to be fixed persistent workouts.  In order for students not to be bored with repeating speech constructs, we will use game elements during the lesson, which allows students to practice various exercises on their own.  Our experience with students shows that sustained knowledge and the ability to put into practice this or that rule comes after 7-9 repetitions.  And if these exercises are as diverse as possible, it will allow you not to lose interest in studying. <br><br>  In order for the speech to be correct and figuratively rich, students are encouraged to practice the pronunciation of popular idioms, as well as standard questions and answer choices.  And all this is fixed with the help of exercises to choose an option, fill in the gaps or translate in parts. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6ed/e30/d1c/6ede30d1c41e46c29476287d231127e3.png"><br><br>  <b>Dialogue</b> <br><br>  Dialogue is associated with the development of conversational skills.  Since the course was written by the acting teachers, it contains their best case studies on ‚Äúlive‚Äù lessons.  We took the most realistic and useful situations, as well as dialogues that students like, and played up to them.  Students are invited to participate in the survey (the interviewer is a robot), but with already existing answers (they are generated within the framework of the topics studied).  You need to pronounce them correctly into the microphone or (if there is none) manually select the correct answer. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/692/c35/cb0/692c35cb0d244f25ba351d4ed1b393b9.png"><br><br>  <b>Conversation lesson</b> <br><br>  If you want to make sure in practice that the classes were not in vain and the material was learned, we give the opportunity to take advantage of our Talking Club on your topic.  Talk to other students, native speakers, and educators to improve your communication skills and diversify the vocabulary on the topic in a webinar format.  In the training course, this stage is not mandatory, but we give students an opportunity to familiarize themselves with the list of questions for the lesson in order to be more prepared. <br><br>  For the convenience of students in the course there is a schedule, the opportunity to prepare and sign up for a suitable time.  You can even choose a moderator - a Russian-speaking teacher or English-speaking. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/569/e53/f60/569e53f600044485858d8c2df3d6aedf.png"><br><br>  <b>Test</b> <br><br>  The final stage - Test.  Here our system itself provides various types of lesson assignments in order to consolidate the knowledge gained. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6a7/baa/372/6a7baa3721104609890b1d3b68f661b8.png"><br>  At this stage, you can make only two mistakes, otherwise it is better to retake the course, well, or at least a test;) <br><br>  <i>Well that's all!</i>  <i>Thank you very much for reading the description of our course and instructions to it to the end.</i>  <i>And we very much hope that our course will be to your taste and will help to improve English.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/322992/">https://habr.com/ru/post/322992/</a></p>
