  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Meizu on Habr√©</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Welcome, Habraludi!  This is the first post in our blog on Habr√©, in it we want to briefly talk about what Meizu is and why did we even come here at all?  It is no secret that the modern world is the world of large corporations of evil or good, to anyone, as well as major brands and the largest manufacturing factories.  Small companies with the desire to create and develop one, but a quality product, very rarely survive on the market among the giants with the model series, updated several times a year.  But there are several such companies that are working on one or several devices and are successful in their own market.  As you understand, we are talking about China and the Asian regions close to it, and you probably know the names of these brands yourself, Meizu is one of them. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/244/279/a2f/244279a2f2dd666c66100ee8b9dc619e.png"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Unfortunately, almost nobody in Runet knows about us, and even if it does, it is in a rather strange way, because the first thought of a person who heard the unfamiliar and unusual name of Meizu is ‚Äúprobably this is something Chinese!‚Äù, Then the thought develops: Chinese consumer goods, low Chinese quality and so on.  Despite the fact that the world has already changed and today the lion‚Äôs share of all products, be it sophisticated electronics, household goods, clothing, food, perfumery and much more, is made in China, people still think that things made in China are necessarily of poor quality.  And if you say to such a person that the Apple iPhone is made in China, he will respond with surprise and round eyes. <br>  In this blog, we will not only talk about current Meizu smartphones on the Android platform, and now there are three (Meizu M9, MX 2-core, MX 4-core), but also talk about the company itself, plans, various features of production, work above the shell, design and other things.  For example, few people know that the quality of materials and assembly Meizu MX competes with the most famous devices and is on par with the Apple iPhone.  Until you take the smartphone in hand, this is not visible.

Impressions of using a smartphone, some comparisons with other phones and much, much more that you like.  Interesting materials we will publish in our blog on Habr√©. <br>  And yet, you may have heard that already at the end of November (the exact date is still unknown), Meizu is likely to introduce its new smartphone in China.  Presumably, the novelty will be named Meizu MX2 and will surpass the existing Meizu MX 4-core in all respects.  Characteristics have not yet been confirmed officially, but are already known in advance: <br><br>  <b>Specifications:</b> <br><ul><li>  Operating system: Android 4.1 with Flyme OS shell </li><li>  Processor: Samsung Exynos 4412 1.6 GHz (Quad-core) </li><li>  Memory: 2 GB (operational), 64 GB (for data storage) </li><li>  Interfaces: Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, microUSB (with support for USB-Host), 3.5 mm miniJack for headset </li><li>  Screen: 4.4 "(Sharp ASV, 1280x800, ppi351), touch, capacitive type </li><li>  Camera: 8 MP with autofocus, LED flash </li><li>  Navigation: GPS, aGPS </li><li>  Battery: 1930 mAh </li></ul><br>  Preliminary characteristics of new items are discussed in our <a href="http://mymeizu.ru/forum/32-258-1">forum</a> . <br><br><img src="http://mymeizu.ru/_fr/2/4990023.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>One possible design for Meizu MX2</i> <br><br>  According to unconfirmed data (yes, there is information that we cannot tell you about) the smartphone will be made in a unibody-package with a very thin frame around the screen, the borders on the left and right will be minimal.  One of the features is the resolution of the display with a ratio of 16:10, the type of matrix, Sharp ASV, while also not officially confirmed, we are waiting for the presentation of the smartphone.  In the blog, we will definitely tell you about the results of the presentation, show a new smartphone and share plans for the dates and prices of its sales in Russia, stay with us! <br><br>  Also, all information on current Meizu smartphones and news are published on our official website <a href="http://mymeizu.ru/">mymeizu.ru</a> , and on the <a href="http://mymeizu.ru/forum/">forum</a> you can ask questions on these smartphones and get hints from device owners. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/158313/">https://habr.com/ru/post/158313/</a></p>
