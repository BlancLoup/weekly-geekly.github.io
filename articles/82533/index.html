Being with the photo, I took a couple of shots. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0d7/bec/f64/0d7becf64ab6472106d8710e5b89590c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Just showed a film, printed pictures;) I invite the most curious to view. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The company's office is located in the very west of Moscow, in the Krylatsky Hills Business Park, which is located on the territory of the Moskvoretsky Natural Historical Park (one of the largest natural parks in the capital, where several territories are combined into one whole - the Moscow River valley) .  If you look at the map and find the Krylatskoye metro station there, thoughts involuntarily give birth to ‚Äúwell <i>, something far from the center</i> ‚Äù - I myself thought about it when I first went to those parts) However, the place was chosen quite successfully - at the interchanges easy to get anywhere, including in the center.  Those who travel "on their own two" right next to the metro are always waiting for free minibuses that travel directly to the business center.  It is especially beautiful there in summer, when green grass grows everywhere and, in general, the atmosphere is not at all like the vanity that is happening in the rest of the Moscow Ring Road.

      Intel has occupied several floors of one of the glass buildings (Earth) of the business center.  There are four buildings in total and they are referred to as Water, Flame, Air and Earth - this, apparently, was caused by the excessive enthusiasm of the main designer RPG-shki) <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/350/0aa/9a0/3500aa9a00452b64f7088d8433367a8e.png" alt="image"><br><br>  In the neighborhood are companies Microsoft, Cisco, Huawei, Johnson &amp; Johnson and others. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/173/f30/0e2/173f300e2e5de02ee41bb9b32dd100cd.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  It all starts with paranoia at the entrance - each visitor is given a plastic Visitor card, which must be returned at the exit. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/75c/3ac/851/75c3ac851f56765359486973325f96fa.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  It is necessary to pay tribute - the security knows his business.  At least, when he saw me with a camera, I had to tell who I was, where and why) And only after they met me ‚Äúon the other side‚Äù, they gave instructions on TB and allowed me to shoot only certain angles.  In particular, it turned out that it is impossible to photograph employees without their consent, working monitors and any documents, as well as all sorts of doors, cameras and other things.  We still managed to get through, but do not be surprised that all the monitors are turned off and there is almost no one in the frames - only a couple of people who agreed to distract from work and whom I forced to ‚Äúpretend‚Äù in front of the camera) I hope for your understanding. <br><br>  The metal doors of a huge elevator open almost just before the reception: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cbf/8ca/bb0/cbf8cabb06bc4ac3f32142190b65719d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  One cannot go anywhere else - one can either wait for the accompanying person in soft leather chairs: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/839/209/fd1/839209fd13167c018212355441f8064c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  ... or learn about the company's achievements: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/089/8a3/97b/0898a397b3bae484a23d70579021df0f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  As it was already possible to partially notice, almost the entire workspace is divided into small ‚Äúcabinets‚Äù, which are correctly called ‚Äúcubicles‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a73/298/189/a732981890ed28fe2721599ed64d5fc5.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  A cubic is a part of space bounded by artificial partitions that do not reach the ceiling.  However, <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259A%25D1%2583%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BB">here is a note</a> from Wikipedia) By the way, this term, apparently, was coined by Intels, the truth is in the main office, which is located in Santa Clara (California, USA).  And the similar structure is uniform for all offices of the company. <br><br>  What are the advantages of such a decision?  In my opinion, they are as follows: <br>  - Allows you to solve the issue of "confidentiality" of each employee; <br>  - Each employee has his own ‚Äúsmall office‚Äù, which can be equipped at will; <br>  - This situation allows not to be distracted by the surrounding world and other employees; <br>  - More rational use of the free space of the building (subject to the rules); <br>  - Less noise. <br>  Accordingly, the workplace of each employee is purely individual - someone has everything plastered with posters and slippers hidden under the table, and someone has a whole collection of mugs so that they can drink every day from the new one) <br><br>  But there are also disadvantages - at least, I almost instantly lost my way in this labyrinth) And still it happens, I want to talk with my colleagues, to participate in the ‚Äúcollective mind‚Äù.  But it can be the other way around as a plus, if collective work is not required - everyone can focus on work and do more.  In general, did not work - I do not know. <br><br>  For example, the workplace of Vlad Nikonov, one of the company's specialists: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/64a/45f/24d/64a45f24d4e83eeb74f2a8622e54eac6.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/842/1a6/6e9/8421a66e9b6d190d314b7e2733672718.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d82/f31/8ab/d82f318ab93c24d11f7ffb8e4cfa2ae5.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/832/6ca/84a/8326ca84a8d503818ed4045b574a007a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The workplace of the manager is no different from the workplace of an ordinary hard worker, whether it is a programmer or a technical specialist.  No private offices and even secretaries - all are equal :) <br><br>  Sometimes various seminars, trainings and other similar events are held - special rooms are set aside for them, equipped with a speakerphone, projectors and a huge number of chairs. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f28/671/6a1/f286716a10bf8431a1ba47cc594e0767.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  When I was wandering around the office, the noise level was at a comfortable level - apparently, the fact that no one is talking, the music is heard in the headphones, and the server and other sounds are far from working ears. However, there are no restrictions on music and communication. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/49b/5f2/0cb/49b5f20cbe4881365eb6b131c144fec6.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The office is warm.  As for the light - it gets a lot of daylight, because  in fact, the building around the perimeter of glass, thereby achieving even greater savings than simply installing energy-saving light bulbs.  Although it was said that in the Nizhny Novgorod office, for example, an entire floor is heated by the heat of the data center - what is also not saving?  ) <br>  If you suddenly get bored in the cubicles - you can get out and work with a beautiful view from the window, fighting off the sun glare on the screen;) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/258/9a1/e88/2589a1e889e91c6cd9cfa7db3d21e4e3.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  On the one hand, a large parking area is visible behind the windows, and on the other, a cycle track where you can not only ride, but also just walk and chat. <br>  By the way, realizing that the majority of employees have sedentary work, the management came up with the program ‚Äú10 000 steps‚Äù - each one is given a special ‚Äústep meter‚Äù, and those who find it most often are periodically encouraged.  In particular, one of the active participants in this program was the previous president of the company, Steve Chase - after each dinner he would wind up 10 thousand steps in parking and surrounding areas;) Other inquisitive minds found out that 10 thousand steps are ‚Äú14 times to go for food the first body and back. "  It turns out, by the way, pregnant girls, young mothers and ... smokers are the most nursed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b43/dc9/5c7/b43dc95c7c051f82bc2b20d062aa1f57.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/561/f4f/814/561f4f81414f0660d4b74775087c5e5c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Vlad offers his ‚Äúhelpless‚Äù assistance in drawing up the annual report :) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5db/d43/00d/5dbd4300d06b16cff65e9e9a71793074.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fd8/bb8/07a/fd8bb807abbd5c90ffebf22d14106c27.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  It was pleasant to like a large number of living plants - they are literally on every corner. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/491/8b2/58b/4918b258b19036249a8e8595ebfe4827.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Somewhere between jobs, not far from the entrance, I discovered such an art.  As it turned out, this is a collective work - the fruit of the joint efforts of many company employees) As far as art is concerned, the company periodically holds photo contests, the best of which adorn different walls. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/123/683/e90/123683e90096ee4fa0b34f38aac7e461.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  When, during work, he starts to rumble in his stomach, one can look into the kitchen to warm up his appetite with a cup of tea or coffee. Then eat tasty food in the dining room or cafe located in the business center.  A meticulous eye technician noticed a radio in the kitchen with a ‚Äúwarm tube sound‚Äù)) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/983/9b6/83b/9839b683b51fe77128df2f981d0fdb83.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The team consists of unequal percentages of M (70%) and F (30%), all young and full of energy. Particularly tired sometimes gather in a small recreation room where they fight each other with intelligence (chess), watch movies) or play the guitar in Wii or tennis. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e7c/290/15a/e7c29015a4ee40fa41c9ed5a0c8695dd.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0af/675/a99/0af675a9928dc005e060ce5d7930a2a5.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4f2/1b1/0db/4f21b10db6d924e4858598b0140bc7c8.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9be/f33/300/9bef33300236e6ef39c6c45367893a2d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  All sorts of contacts, classmates and twitterers, as far as I know, are not prohibited (although my personal experience shows that at work it‚Äôs best to protect yourself - in order to increase efficiency), and as IM-tools, most workers use Skype and Gtalk.  Even more - in fact there are no prohibitions, but sometimes they are born, if for good reason.  For example, there was a funny story - the birthday of one employee successfully coincided with the arrival to the HR office from the states.  Actually, the new ceiling was successfully filled with champagne right in front of a foreign guest, after which all the celebrations in the office became extremely sober :) <br>  There is no such thing as work ‚Äúfrom call to call‚Äù - the main thing is that the work be done on time.  In the office, you can appear at any time, even at night (which, by the way, programmers use).  The uniform is also not critical - it is equally possible to come both in a strict suit, and in all sorts of jeans-sweaters;  I was lucky and I met a programmer in white socks and sandals) <br>  In general, as you can see, the company does not squander money and does not suit the ‚Äúwestern window dressing‚Äù, does not make pools in the offices of managers and does not occupy a hectare of space that is used in vain - everything is much more modest.  Almost all conditions have been created for work, which in the end is the most important thing - after all, one has to work there, and not come to have fun) By the way, judging by some numbers of empty cubicles, there are very many vacant places. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7a3/e1a/161/7a3e1a161e6d06f6991f28689aa83c08.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In general, once again convinced - well, where we do not) <br>  <b>Successes!</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/82533/">https://habr.com/ru/post/82533/</a></p>
