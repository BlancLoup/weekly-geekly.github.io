    <h4>  Sony and the high-definition sound market </h4><br>  In the reports made by Sony at the same time during the annual IFA exhibition in Berlin and at the event at the Lincoln Center in New York, the company declared its commitment to high definition sound - it sees the future of recorded music as such.  That is why Sony will support the development of hi-res audio format.  In addition, the theme of high-definition sound has become one of the central ones at CES 2014. <br><br><h4>  Pono music </h4><br>  In addition, musician Neil Young announced the launch in 2014 in partnership with Meridian Audio <a href="https://www.facebook.com/NeilYoungPono/posts/626518460715191">of the</a> PONO <a href="https://www.facebook.com/NeilYoungPono/posts/626518460715191">music system</a> , with which a wide audience can get the sound of a ‚Äústudio‚Äù quality.  <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1003614822/ponomusic-where-your-soul-rediscovers-music">The</a> project <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1003614822/ponomusic-where-your-soul-rediscovers-music">campaign</a> on Kickstarter was extremely successful. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/EdRfPH28q0g%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjas-XUv9kEQb9kTilK1ohSyQJeTQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  True, this project has its critics - the Gizmodo publication published a scathing <a href="http://gizmodo.com/what-is-high-resolution-audio-1252637824/1541582373/%2Bmarioaguilar">material</a> called ‚ÄúWhy there is no point in the Pono music player‚Äù. <br><br>  Nevertheless, a surge of interest in "audiophilia" and sound quality is obvious. <br><br><h4>  What's happening </h4><br>  Many may ask this question or, moreover, ask, why is this important at all?  After all, many manufacturers of equipment for audiophiles nevertheless support digital formats hated by lovers of pure sound like mp3. <br><br>  But when Sony Electronics President Phil Molyneux comes on the scene in front of a lot of people and says that ‚Äúit‚Äôs time to offer high-definition audio products that allow a pure sound enthusiast to listen to your favorite music in your desired quality‚Äù it becomes obvious that everything is serious. <br><br>  This means not just the release of various music playback systems with built-in disk storage and other similar things, but also support for global labels, like Sony Music (naturally), Universal Music Group and Warner Music Group. <br><br>  Indeed, hi-res music by artists working with the labels listed will be uploaded to some new Sony products.  As Matt Signore of Warner said: <br><br><blockquote>  Sony's preloaded music initiative will be able to show a large number of people the benefits of high definition sound - given the scale of the organization and its experience in marketing, there is no doubt about that. </blockquote><br>  In addition to creating products that make it easy to download, store and play MP3 music, the company is finally moving to support high-definition formats. <br><br><h4>  Further effort </h4><br>  There are also special vendor sites dedicated to high-definition audio products and this phenomenon itself.  Here, for example, is <a href="http://www.sony.co.uk/hub/high-resolution-audio">the</a> Sony <a href="http://www.sony.co.uk/hub/high-resolution-audio">website</a> for UK users, and here is a <a href="http://www.sony.com/hires">resource</a> for an audience from the USA.  The task of these projects is to promote high-quality sound, as well as promoting relevant products and resources where you can find music in the right formats. <br><br>  At CES 2014, much attention was paid to new Sony products for lovers of high-quality sound ( <i>general audio results of the exhibition can be found in our topics -</i> <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/audiomania/blog/211649/">one</a> , <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/audiomania/blog/212205/">two</a> ).  In particular - the player <a href="http://store.sony.com/hi-res-music-player-with-1tb-hdd-zid27-HAPZ1ES/cat-27-catid-All-Res-Audio">HAP-Z1ES</a> .  The principle of operation of the device is not much different from the iPod (although it is much larger in size), but in terms of sound quality, the Sony product wins the Apple device in all respects.  It can play - and ‚Äúimprove on the go‚Äù - sound of almost any format: DSD (DSF, DSDIFF with a frequency of 2.8 or 5.6 MHz), PCM (16, 24, or 32-bit with a frequency of 44.1, 48, 88.2, 96 , 176.4, or 192kHz), WAV, AIFF, FLAC, ALAC, ATRAC, ATRAC, MP3, AAC, or WMA. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ad6/078/b19/ad6078b19b0ab4de9b45de8bedadc0c7.png" alt="image"><br><br>  In addition, the device has a disk of 1 terabyte for storing files.  Plus, external drives can be connected to it.  Another convenient feature is the ability to connect to the network, which allows you to listen to Internet radio. <br><br>  Thanks to DSD Remastering Engine technology, Sony‚Äôs ineners have been able to give their product the ability to ‚Äúrestore‚Äù sound quality even for compressed digital file formats. <br><br>  Yes, Sony could be more agile in promoting hi-end sound, because many people around the world already want to listen to music in high quality and spend a lot of money on the corresponding devices. <br><br>  However, it is better late than never, and if Sony and other manufacturers manage to reduce the cost of access (with an acceptable level of quality) to hi-end music and popularize it, then among the broad masses of users can finally be born a request for high-quality sound.  And this, in turn, will lead to increased competition and a further fall in prices and greater availability of high-quality sound. <br><br>  Fans of high-quality music have been treading on the threshold for too long, not daring to enter the world of the mass market of the audio industry.  It's time to finally take a step to the next level. <br><br>  <b>Posts and related links:</b> <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/audiomania/blog/228545/">Quality of life: why architects need to pay more attention to sound</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/audiomania/blog/227319/">The difference between "included music background" and "listen to music"</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/audiomania/blog/218901/">The ‚Äúpost-fidelity‚Äù era in the world of sound</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.audiomania.ru/portable_hifi/">Portable hi-fi on the site "Audiomania"</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/audiomania/blog/215995/">Is it possible to measure sound quality?</a> </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/230163/">https://habr.com/ru/post/230163/</a></p>
