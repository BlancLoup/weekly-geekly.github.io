  <section class="page js-page"><h1>bb-mobile MicrON-3 - pocket Bluetooth-headset for the "shovels"</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The screen size of an average smartphone today is 5 inches.  Is it worth clarifying that not everyone is comfortable talking about such ‚Äúgiants‚Äù?  Of course, you can purchase a relatively compact device with a diagonal of 4-4.3 inches, and it will be much more convenient.  Here are just the most functional smartphones (and many models of the middle class too) are equipped with either 5-inch or even larger displays.  Girls suffer especially from this: they also want a large functional smartphone, they buy it, and then they face the fact that it‚Äôs not so easy to keep such a ‚Äúmachine‚Äù for a long time. <br><br>  The usual ‚Äúear‚Äù Bluetooth headset is, of course, a solution to the above problem, but I personally don‚Äôt like to wear a piece of plastic on my ear.  The first ‚Äúear with blue teeth‚Äù I bought another year in 2004 - it was some kind of model from Siemens.  Then periodically I acquired Samsung, Jabra and Motorola, but I couldn‚Äôt make friends with one of them - it‚Äôs not convenient, annoying, I want to take it off and stuff like that ... Meanwhile, lately, I need a wireless headset very sharply - he took for long trials the 5.7-inch Lexand Antares, which, due to its size, holds passion as uncomfortable for the ear. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/134/4d4/470/1344d4470f40e2ff94ba2c73757640e2.jpg"><a name="habracut"></a><br>  5.7-inch Lexand Antares

      I recently visited a friend and found such a thing on his shelf: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f57/d1a/07e/f57d1a07eb80a39ce3f8827ba295cca0.jpg"><br><br>  This is the LG HBM-700 - under various names it was served in the USA, South Korea and a number of other regions, only this was quite a long time ago, in the mid-2000s.  ‚ÄúFriendly‚Äù copy, alas, turned out to be unworkable - a couple of years ago, the battery ‚Äúdied‚Äù.  (This is normal for headsets, their batteries fail much faster than in the same smartphones.) <br><br>  Meanwhile, the very concept of the LG HBM-700 I really liked - it is a kind of miniature "Bluetooth-phone" with a screen and buttons, allowing you to leave your smartphone in your pocket and talk on a much lighter and more compact "stick" with the ability to dial numbers. <br><br>  I did a little ‚Äúresearch‚Äù and found out that HTC has something similar: the HTC Mini +, this is a headset, and a kind of remote control for smartphones and HTC HTC Media Link HD.  Everything would be fine, but this magnificence is worth 4,500 rubles - in my opinion, a bit too much for a headset.  And then: I'm not sure that it will work properly with devices that are not released by HTC. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/996/d4f/01f/996d4f01f5b512e1777c80eaa6509299.jpg"><br>  HTC Mini + <br><br>  Another similar product at IFA 2013 showed TCL / Alcatel.  But when it comes on sale, how much will it cost and whether it will work with models of other brands is an open question. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1d0/878/3a0/1d08783a047b2d30831543a8f8ce71d1.jpg"><br><br>  Next, I came across a number of Bluetooth headsets of the Russian brand bb-mobile.  It has three such things: MicrON, MicrON-2 and MicrON-3.  The first two resemble small cell phones, and the third is just a rectangle with a speaker and control keys, that is, without a screen and number buttons.  It so happened that the test was able to get exactly the third version - well, let me tell you about it, and at the same time I compare it in absentia with the first two models. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/119/b5f/b8c/119b5fb8c8589fc6c24807110f4461ed.jpg"><br>  bb-mobile micrON <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c84/7cb/435/c847cb435e73631061c48eae041a1a59.jpg"><br>  bb-mobile micrON-2 <br><br>  bb-mobile MicrON-3 is shipped in this package.  The package bundle includes a charger from a USB port, a lanyard for carrying around your neck, and a couple of books ‚Äî instructions and a guarantee. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c99/407/636/c9940763617951a419101943fe0a4668.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f6a/e31/98b/f6ae3198bb1b1dc8aaf19fe430ccb49f.jpg"><br><br>  Two points: the first is that the blister is scratching well (although for 1,000 rubles it is excusable).  That is, "Micron" is quite suitable for the role of a gift, but you might not be able to find packaging without a single scratch in the store.  The second point - with the white versions of the headset is white as the lace, with black - black.  In my opinion, white is not very practical: it quickly ‚Äúbecomes filthy‚Äù, especially in summer in the heat. <br><br>  The total bb-mobile MicrON-3 options are four - three white and black: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/dd3/a5c/0cd/dd3a5c0cd8061b382dc65e0c51dd2af9.jpg"><br><br>  Further on features and capabilities. <br><br>  First and foremost, in bb-mobile MicrON-3, developers have significantly simplified the concept.  At first glance, this is an obvious disadvantage.  For example, to make a call in the case of the two previous headsets, you didn‚Äôt need to get a smartphone from your pocket or bag - the Mikron screens displayed contacts from its address book.  Meanwhile, using bb-mobile MicrON-3, you can only receive calls and also dial the last number dialed (two quick presses on the middle button).  For everything else, you will have to bring your ‚Äúshovel‚Äù to the world. <br><br>  However, if you dig deeper, the following will turn out: first, the third "Micron" costs 1,000 rubles, the second - 2,000, the first - 1,500. Yes, in principle, 500-1,000 rubles are not gigantic money, but just in case Purchasing a phone accessory such savings are definitely enjoyable.  The second point is the battery life: on the bb-mobile site it is indicated that MicrON and MicrON-2 work on one charge for no more than 7 hours.  Meanwhile, bb-mobile MicrON-3 lasted 9 with a hook from me (it was specially tested in the ‚Äúnon-stop speech transmission‚Äù mode).  Probably, the work time was increased by the removal of "extra" components. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/83d/32d/bc0/83d32dbc0be52ec9e4b1141556f2f784.jpg"><br>  Motorola Finiti and bb-mobile MicrON-3 <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e9c/2ff/789/e9c2ff789b23b94481f60de5699c7a42.jpg"><br><br>  Actually, the "superfluous" was removed, but what remains?  The bb-mobile MicrON-3 is a thin (less than 7 millimeters) and light (30 grams) rectangle of glossy plastic with a speaker, microphone and three ‚Äútransparent‚Äù control buttons.  The assembly is neat, the quality of the materials is very much nothing.  Also on the case there is a loop for a lace, a connector for a charger and a bb-mobile logo, in which the LED is built in - that‚Äôs all.  Speaking of charging: I would really like to see a microUSB here. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1d1/3b3/25b/1d13b325b9e56734fdac0f2896834da4.jpg"><br><br>  Using the keys, you can do the following: accept / drop / end calls, hold a call, switch between a couple of calls, adjust the speaker volume, switch the call from the phone to the headset and back, turn the microphone on / off.  In fact, there is no difference with the majority of "ear" Bluetooth headsets.  Well, except that multipoint bb-mobile MicrON-3 supports - but this function is far from unique in recent years. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d07/e7a/804/d07e7a804b72e6a6b6d7a74774d45dd0.jpg"><br><br>  In the case of bb-mobile MicrON-3, it proved to be quite good - the quality of voice transmission / reception is high, there are no unnecessary rustles.  The melody, however, is played not from the smartphone, but another one recorded in the memory of the headset.  But this is the case with devices on Android.  I didn‚Äôt check it with ‚ÄúiPhone‚Äù, but the developers promise that your ringtone will play in his case. <br><br>  The headset also connects to the computer - testing with Skype, everything works like a clock. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c5a/586/1c2/c5a5861c2018010dacb591b23d39f55a.jpg"><br>  Lexand Antares and bb-mobile MicrON-3 <br><br>  There is nothing more to talk about - the device is simple but useful.  I personally do not speak much on the phone, and more often I receive calls, rather than calling myself.  So the lack of a screen and keyboard in bb-mobile MicrON-3 doesn‚Äôt bother me much.  For 1 000 rubles (compare with 4 500 in the case of the HTC Mini +) a decent product, you can recommend.  If you call yourself more often, you can look, for example, at bb-mobile MicrON-1 - it is deprived of all the minuses of the ‚Äútroika‚Äù. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/198570/">https://habr.com/ru/post/198570/</a></p>
