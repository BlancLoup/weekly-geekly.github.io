Today, you guessed it ... well, you understood everything correctly. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e78/f23/373/e78f23373472d6c52c51841514ba0ec2.jpg"><br><br>  Main office building of the company <img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/227/d15/e16/227d15e1621583a662a1efbb0daa36ba.png">  <b>ICQ</b> has been in Tel Aviv, on Kiryat Atidim Street for 10 years already.  However, the "building of the company" is loudly said - this is a relatively small and inconspicuous business center, in which the company occupies the top (fourth) floor.  In the same building are the offices of two more companies - <b>IBM</b> and <b>Harel Information Technologies</b> .  The list of ‚ÄúIT people‚Äù in the building seems to be ending, although the area is very high-tech - almost every neighboring building has an office of some company known to us all.  For example, Nokia - I think everyone heard. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/029/164/515/0291645155196fc2ccac925827ef8625.jpg">

      <br>
      Right outside the building is a corporate parking lot - most employees arrive at the office on 4 wheels: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ae8/dbd/3e6/ae8dbd3e68eb7299d143fe5c68a31431.jpg"><br><br>  As in most modern companies, in ICQ everything starts from the reception desk - a smiling girl surrounded by balloons greeted us with her friendly ‚Äúwalks‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6ac/4a0/b65/6ac4a0b658499ccfe0e16db71548a7b8.jpg"><br><br>  By the way, here are the balls - they were hung either for our arrival, or for Christmas, or a month before the new year ... or they are there all the time - below you will see that there are a lot of ‚ÄúICQ‚Äù logos all over the office.  Anyway, almost at once a festive atmosphere was created - it‚Äôs great if they always have it there. <br><br>  By the way, the ICQ logo can be found simply everywhere, wherever you look - I would not be surprised if someone from the staff has it stuffed somewhere on the shoulder.  On the windows of the entrance door and on the carpet, on the walls and on posters, on each desktop, on pens and notebooks, on badges and signs, on backpacks and T-shirts - B-E-Z-D-E, a whole meadow of flowers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/12e/b9d/8d4/12eb9d8d4d03fdd6dc6f8c9a29901da5.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d6e/24a/d03/d6e24ad0390d896955b225b8c5132bd3.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c0d/ad6/d4f/c0dad6d4f7f011e9ea84282de7d4d562.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/500/1b3/ad0/5001b3ad0c48c9fcee0835cfae15a895.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/be5/f5e/102/be5f5e102948f7b03ac0a2eec7742533.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/61f/82e/045/61f82e0453b663b5aba3abaa95f1a4e4.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/728/1bb/78e/7281bb78e8495e21aa0f607bc0ccf702.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9db/8ae/94c/9db8ae94ceecfb86f083c1fe00018090.jpg"><br><br>  Some people even see this in advertising, but if you think about it - who is here and what does it advertise?  After all, the office is primarily for employees who already know everything.  So this is most likely part of the corporate culture - I saw a similar level of branding only in <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/office/133358/">Beeline‚Äôs office</a> .  And what ... if Habr and Kadabra had logos easier, I would also sculpt them wherever possible;) <br><br>  Another design finding from the category of "Connecting People" is a ribbon with names in different languages, which runs under the ceiling around the perimeter of the entire office (the generic word is <b>Everybody</b> ).  And all the meeting rooms are named after different cities of Israel - the general word is <b>Everywhere</b> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7bc/40f/4f2/7bc40f4f29c2efe1da5bf46c8664815d.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6bd/992/7bc/6bd9927bc741f9b2c526b2282b91b1d0.jpg"><br><br>  The whole office space is divided into two types of workplaces - small private offices and open space, divided by cubicles (as in the Russian <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/intel/blog/82533/">office of Intel</a> ).  A rather typical office environment - something fundamentally new has not been encountered. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/fb9/f14/7bf/fb9f147bfade31acec181599d45fcd97.jpg"><br><br>  At the entrance, each workplace has its own ‚Äúbadge‚Äù with the name and position of an employee, and some also have a so-called ‚Äú <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259C%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B7%25D1%2583%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B0">mezuzah</a> ‚Äù, a special box on the door jamb, in which there is a small scroll with a prayer.  However, this is already a religion, rather than an office - just paid attention to it, as I first saw it :) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a5d/ceb/419/a5dceb419526a8d7937599877727f2aa.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/049/4a7/7d9/0494a77d98413e7ccbf41696d5e906ce.jpg"><br><br>  Inside the room there is a space for flight of fantasy.  Everyone draws up his workplace as he wants. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6cf/fa9/0df/6cffa90df6b49f731cdd9067dacf6827.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9d4/84c/4a9/9d484c4a9f01d4842d0dc18b45b3141d.jpg"><br><br>  Among computers there are both PCs and Macs, but the first are the vast majority.  Macs are mostly only for those employees who develop this area in the project. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d2d/038/8f0/d2d0388f0dbd98f947f0305135fd8a65.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c37/377/cfe/c37377cfe2c6e009e05639caf7017027.jpg"><br><br>  Despite the layout of this keyboard, the main language in the office is English: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/66a/f4e/783/66af4e78317b2bfb481e3831300b5db7.jpg"><br><br>  But what surprised me the most was the people themselves.  Look at the photos below - do you think that I am a super photographer and ‚Äúcaught emotions‚Äù after making people laugh with the unfamiliar word ‚ÄúHabrahabr‚Äù?  No matter how!  Good mood, openness, sincere smile - this is just a tiny part of what fell into the lens.  In reality, all this is multiplied and exaggerated - I really enjoyed the communication, even despite the fact that ‚ÄúMay English from the believer is little‚Äù.  All people are cheerful, sleep ... oh!  However, I do not want to say at all that all this is characteristic only of employees from ICQ - it seems that this is characteristic of everyone who lives outside of Russia.  No, no, I do not urge everyone to blame, but it seems that where we are not there is really good :) At the end of the article there will be links to reviews of other offices - go for the sake of interest, compare. <br><br>  Yaniv Levinson (Business Director): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/245/2cd/cad/2452cdcad2567043b7950392e10dd3ed.jpg"><br><br>  Schraga Mor (Chief Officer), Mor Yegerman (vice president of R &amp; D), Eti De Leon (vice president of human resources) Moshe Kigler (vice president of product): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/cf7/c04/e4b/cf7c04e4bbd74d0acd21ae997c6cea12.jpg"><br><br>  In total, the office employs about 90 people, a third of whom are girls.  Designer Liraz Abuhatzira: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d89/4d4/292/d894d429289240772d6dff3f39cc8bd8.jpg"><br><br>  Developers of the Android client version - Eugene Rozenberg and Dor Sakal: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f1e/cf8/77d/f1ecf877da4e9c943e200eb58fa7b3e2.jpg"><br><br>  Project Manager, Noam Moravchik: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5e6/4ea/b9a/5e64eab9aa5615c7019705cd860a0b18.jpg"><br><br>  Shay Klayman (developing business): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f52/fd4/82f/f52fd482f6368bbce572cf6103e5a4fc.jpg"><br><br>  Nimrod Auslander - a support employee and simply an IT specialist :) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6bc/987/a21/6bc987a2166a276fb32bcd29523dc12e.jpg"><br><br>  Nofar Cohav is another support staff member: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b71/a2c/0c0/b71a2c0c073cc684e747429b5ee7d406.jpg"><br><br>  Valerie Roberts, lawyer: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4a6/ab8/b2e/4a6ab8b2ecb62fa72fe40e0444afa5ec.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3ae/851/d25/3ae851d2507cc69707f649cb675c63a1.jpg"><br><br>  The working day starts at 9 am and ends by 7 am, but if you have a lot of work, they work up to 12. Uniform is free - considering that it is always warm there, you can come at least in shorts. <br><br>  Quite often, employees of a department gather at the blackboard and discuss certain issues - they set tasks, offer solutions to them, and scatter ideas.  The photo shows the programmers of the client‚Äôs desktop version: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/05f/a02/357/05fa02357e0f963e52aec6e873be06f0.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a21/ab1/119/a21ab111951cc059903e99693262f5c2.jpg"><br><br>  In general, the social life in the company is not bad developed - everyone knows each other, helps, drinks beer in the evenings) And about once a month someone from the staff gives a lecture about some technology - all this happens at a collective lunch.  Food is mainly ordered from all kinds of places around - cafes, restaurants, etc. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4f6/81c/c6a/4f681cc6a95ece699f3c4605c96e3579.jpg"><br><br>  On one of the walls are graphics (in real time) of registrations and logins from mobile devices (for some reason, only for two platforms - iPhone and Android). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/34b/864/ffd/34b864ffdaf1f9c62cde4aa13143d1e9.jpg"><br><br>  On the floor there is a server room - for the first time I see that it was behind glass;  usually everything in a separate room with seven seals. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d43/54e/427/d4354e427e9bdcf6855e4d75f5a0c11e.jpg"><br><br>  At first, they didn‚Äôt want to let anyone inside, but when everyone moved away, I made eyes like a cat from the cartoon ‚ÄúShrek‚Äù and I managed to make a couple of frames ‚Äúwithout glare‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/57f/a70/517/57fa70517c9b660d735d4cede5e83ecf.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f02/fdc/407/f02fdc40788faa53fe33dcd08e493491.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a83/997/370/a83997370b8d61e9a69b15a6c50e474e.jpg"><br><br>  They, too, for fair elections! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5d4/d3b/c0e/5d4d3bc0e931a8bde3631b4c6d99d108.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6c3/593/9e4/6c35939e4e4af2e4587fd56ad7aadc3b.jpg"><br><br>  Do not think that this ‚Äúchaos‚Äù keeps the whole service - server data exclusively for internal needs. <br><br>  In general, before, I imagined ICQ a much larger company, for some time I even lived with the opinion that only employees were sitting on ‚Äúfive signs‚Äù - I expected to see something incredible, amazing, ‚Äúforeign‚Äù.  But when I saw how it really is, I was not upset at all, but simply reacted with understanding - no, well, you must agree why there are several thousand employees in such a company :) Therefore, the ‚Äúnest‚Äù on one of the floors of the business center is what need to. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3fa/386/ea4/3fa386ea4e44aa5094d75ee2eea649f7.jpg"><br><br>  Taking this opportunity: before once again writing ‚Äúsomething is somehow gray with them, nothing unusual,‚Äù remember that the purpose of my publications on this blog is not to make you groan and gasp from what you see, but to show what represents the inner world and workflow of an IT company.  Here comes the president to some factory - for the sake of him carpets are laid there, paint fences and remove all unnecessary ... nice and order, like, but boring ?!  And why this self-deception.  It is much more interesting to come around as an auditor when no one is waiting for you from ordinary employees - there is a working mess reigning on the tables, solid insights on the marker boards, and in the server server they ask for Hubr.  I want to show these weekdays - in order to know about what awaits if you decide to work in this or that company :) <br><br>  In general, Israel is very amazing - I would love to go there again.  About him (and his car situation in particular) I will soon write separately on <a href="http://autokadabra.ru/">Avtokadabra</a> - taking this opportunity, I invite everyone to our cozy saytik. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a0e/302/cf0/a0e302cf085c17ef39fd0faadd19506d.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/230/692/91d/23069291de76f943d57a3e46f6e692db.gif">  Oh oh. <br><br>  - <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/office/133358/">Office of the company Beeline</a> <br>  - <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/office/130518/">Office Odnoklassniki</a> <br>  - <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/office/124347/">Office of the company Vkontakte</a> <br>  - <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/intel/blog/82533/">Office of Intel</a> (in Moscow) <br>  - <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/intel/blog/106911/">Office of Intel</a> (in Nizhny Novgorod) <br>  - <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/office/91646/">Boomburum office</a> <br>  - <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/p/83155/">Data center "Oversan-Mercury"</a> <br><br>  So, to whom next year to call :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/135288/">https://habr.com/ru/post/135288/</a></p>
