    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Our company is located in <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2595%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B1%25D1%2583%25D1%2580%25D0%25B3">Yekaterinburg</a> .  If you do not know, this is such a small village far beyond the Moscow Ring Road.  Although I prefer another point of view - this is a city with a population of almost half a million people, located in the very center of Russia on the border of Europe and Asia, which claims to be the third capital.  Like all zamkadnikov we have inferiority complexes, especially among city and regional officials.  Apparently, therefore, as well as from a great desire to spend a bunch of budget funds, about 5 years ago, we beat Yekaterinburg-EXPO.  It was just otgrohali, but not built, because they put it in the swamp and the money was mastered at the construction site is quite a tidy sum.  Who cares - you can read about the exhibition center on <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2595%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B1%25D1%2583%25D1%2580%25D0%25B3-%25D0%25AD%25D0%25BA%25D1%2581%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE">Wikipedia</a> . <br><br>  Why built?  Apparently they didn‚Äôt give rest to the laurels of the Hannover exhibition complex, where the world's largest industrial exhibition Hannover Messe and the IT exhibition CeBIT take place.  By the way, I was there.  In Hanover, there are about 500 inhabitants, and about the same have come to major exhibitions in the best years.  Now the exhibition activity with the development of the Internet is gradually decreasing, however, 200 thousand visitors from other countries to Hannover come to each of these exhibitions.  The exhibition complex has become a real ‚Äúcity-forming enterprise‚Äù for Hanover.  Around him revolves and the hotel business, and catering, and much more. <br>  We, like Hanover, have regularly held <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2598%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC">Innoprom</a> , as many say, ‚Äúthe largest industrial exhibition in Russia‚Äù.  Such an ‚Äúinnovation‚Äù turned out.  In the world, the exhibitions have already passed, and again we decided to catch up and overtake <s>America with</s> Europe. <br><br><h4>  Think our client Innoprom?  Not guessed.  Briefly about the client. </h4><br>  The <a href="http://allishall.ru/">Allishall</a> company <a href="http://allishall.ru/">is</a> engaged in the hotel business, owns a hostel, a mini-hotel, and also rents a certain number of apartments for rent.  In general, it is a typical representative of a small business that does not have big money or some unique resource (for example, an administrative one).  They work in the wildest competition, as well as the general crisis situation in the country. <br><br>  We have been cooperating for more than five years.  At first they provided SEO services, but stopped doing it after Yandex gave all the first two dozen positions to directories and aggregators.  Then they switched to context, but as I said, the competition is wild, the price tag for the main key requests is 300 rubles per spec.  accommodation and more.  With the price of an apartment per day 1500r, and the beds in the hostel 500r, advertising does not discourage themselves.  Therefore, we conduct the context very carefully, use low-frequency, synchronize the placement with the actual employment of rooms and apartments, and also use remarketing and retargeting. <br><br><h4>  It is clear with the client, what's the reason for Innoprom? </h4><br>  Innoprom, of course, is not CeBIT or Hannover Messe, to which more than 200 thousand people come.  However, several thousand visitors from other cities, nevertheless, this exhibition attracts.  This year came, for example, friendly Chinese delegations.  The competition among hotels is very high, only at the airport, which is not far from the exhibition, two large hotels, plus a hotel near the exhibition center itself, which is in the list of EXPO recommended for delegations. <br><br>  There was a question, how to tell all these people about a small but proud AllisHall company?  We were surprised to find that, at the request of Innoprom 2015, there was not a single contextual ad, and decided with the client to try to get up right away in the special placement.  The transition cost a reasonable amount of money. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/d29/af8/0e3/d29af80e382cb96f949f112c9669a7d5.png" alt="image"><br><br>  And it went, there were transitions and applications began to arrive.  Everything was fine, until on the last day of the ad we saw a sharply increased expense.  Since almost all the apartments and so were already booked, we quickly turned off the ad and applied to Yandex for a possible sklik.  While Yandex responded to our request, we ourselves tried to understand what was happening. <br><br>  It was in the following.  On the local popular portal published devastating and very resonant <a href="http://ura.ru/articles/1036265276">article about the poor organization of the exhibition</a> .  At the end of the article, ‚Äúthe <a href="http://zergulio.livejournal.com/2985851.html">last nail in the coffin of the organizers</a> ‚Äù was scored, referring to the fact that in the search for ‚ÄúInnoprom‚Äù, instead of the exhibition site, our ad with an offer of <s>girls for an hour of</s> apartments for a day, which, of course, does not paint such a pathetic event.  I quote. <br><br><blockquote>  It is possible that the next exhibition will be organized by another operator, a source in the governor‚Äôs administration confirms dissatisfaction with the work of Formika Group.  If in the spring there were rumors about the extension of the contract for the maintenance of Innoprom to 2025 (under current conditions it expires in 2016), then today is not so simple.  Score in ‚ÄúYandex‚Äù ‚ÄúInnoprom - 2015‚Äù - and you will understand everything.  The first will come out advertising "Apartments Ekaterinburg".  The main industrial exhibition of the country and the Sverdlovsk region do not deserve this. </blockquote><br><br>  It immediately became clear that a large number of readers climbed to check whether such an ad was actually displayed and, for the sake of interest, clicked on it. <br><br><h4>  Results. </h4><br>  1. Yandex refused to compensate for the clicks with a formal reply, although we very convincingly explained where these transitions came from, providing links to the article and some blogs where a wave started.  Well, okay.  In the end we are to blame. <br>  2. The client is satisfied, since all his apartments were eventually rented, and we settled the situation with overspending by taking it over. <br>  3. In all campaigns with the minimum number of requests and minimum bids, you should always limit the budget so as not to end up in such a situation when demand suddenly grows.  You should not hope that you even compensate for the frank sklik, and even more so such a non-standard situation. <br>  4. The organizers of the exhibition will clearly receive a pope.  Still, inquiries on their own brand should be redeemed.  And this can be said not only about Innoprom, but about such monsters as Obi and Ikea.  And Hoff - well done. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/01e/ec8/372/01eec83729fd44fc268c4ec51c83d5ab.png" alt="image"><br><br>  5. Even in highly competitive topics, you can always find non-standard moves.  Think and you will succeed. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/293078/">https://habr.com/ru/post/293078/</a></p>
