Practical Information Security: The Results of 2014, Part I</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/630/d7e/366/630d7e366d854d9991a1106a3e543ccf.png" align="left">  Good day! <br><br>  We would like to welcome all the fans of our blog and summarize the outgoing 2014.  This year, PENTESTIT launched two training programs for specialists in the field of practical information security: Zero Security: A and Corporate penetration testing laboratories. <br><br>  The programs, as planned, turned out to be different: both in terms of the level of training and in the complexity of the material being taught.  I would like to tell you what we have achieved for each of the programs. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  <b>ZeroSecurity: A</b> </h5><br>  Due to the lack of high-quality practical training for most people, we give the opportunity not only to get acquainted with high-quality theoretical material, but also, most importantly, to try to apply these skills in real ("combat") conditions.  This service is not provided by any company in Russia and the CIS, which makes our courses unique and accessible to everyone interested.

      We cooperate with individuals and companies.  Over the past year, we have trained more than 350 people and 30% is a legal entity.  faces.  This suggests that the business is interested in training its specialists and is ready to pay for it. <br><br>  About 20% of those who were trained and ZS: A came to us at the second stage of preparation - the course ‚ÄúCorporate Laboratories‚Äù.  Looking at these numbers, we understand that we are doing our work for good reason.  They trust us, and it is worth a lot. <br>  The last set this year for the course ‚ÄúZero Security: A‚Äù starts on <a href="https://www.pentestit.ru/study/zerosecurity-a">11/30/14</a> <br><br><h4>  <b>"Corporate penetration testing laboratories"</b> </h4><br>  In this course we have implemented unique technical developments and methods of teaching material.  The course was difficult and interesting.  It is very different from Zero Security: A, in it we have implemented all the most relevant <br>  the vector of attacks and protection, fine-tuning of both server infrastructure and network equipment, showed in detail the vulnerabilities that could be encountered by specialists who support the performance of the corporate network, systems, Web sites and cloud storages, showed them how to significantly increase the level of information security. <br><br>  Under this program, specialists can receive both additional skills and undergo actual retraining.  All teachers of the course are ‚Äúpractitioners‚Äù with extensive experience.  We do not talk about current vulnerabilities, we show them, demonstrating methods of attack and defense.  Each new set is essentially a new program, which lays out all the most relevant vulnerabilities at the time of the start of groups. <br><br>  Over the past year, more than 100 specialists have completed the KL course.  Most of them (90%) are ‚Äúlegal entities‚Äù, but there are also physical entities.  Individuals - people who paid for their studies on their own. <br><br>  This Sunday, <a href="https://www.pentestit.ru/labs/corp-lab">11/16/2014</a> , the last group this year will be launched under the program ‚ÄúCorporate penetration testing laboratories‚Äù. <br><br>  We receive a lot of positive feedback on our courses, but there are also negative ones - we are always ready to admit our mistakes and improve the quality of the material taught.  We thank all who left wishes and comments on the courses - thanks to your attention the program turns out to be even more interesting and high-quality. <br><br>  Today, according to the comments and feedback left by experts at the end of training, the quality assessment of training programs is 4.8 points out of 5. We are proud of these results and will continue to keep the quality at an appropriate level. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/63f/d62/e69/63fd62e694784a3a80d6fe73886fbd23.jpg"><br><br><h4>  <b>Conclusion</b> </h4><br>  Our goal is to make the courses as convenient and informative as possible, to show that the future of each person depends only on himself, on his perseverance and determination.  In a difficult time for the country, everyone must make a choice for themselves: either live, as it will, or go forward.  The best investment is an investment in yourself, in your self-development and advanced training. <br><br>  Soon, organizations will need qualified specialists, they will not need ‚Äúbeautiful‚Äù pieces of paper and beautiful faces, they will need a result and high-quality work. <br><br>  In the new, 2015, pleasant surprises await you: <br>  1. We will introduce new, redesigned training programs; <br>  2. A global update is waiting for the ‚ÄúPersonal Account‚Äù of users, new functions will be added and a completely redesigned design will be presented; <br>  3. We will launch our own platform for webinars and presentations.  A distinctive feature of this site will be the ability to view webinars online using mobile devices based on iOS and Android. <br><br>  Thanks to everyone who has been with us throughout this year!  Only with your help we become better and more effective.  See you soon! <br><br>  Sincerely, PENTESTIT Team. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/243083/">https://habr.com/ru/post/243083/</a></p>
