  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Why do programmers live well in Megaplan?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  No matter what anyone says, and programming is a work that cannot be done creatively, almost like painting.  After all, the programmer, while writing the code, makes a lot of decisions about how ‚Äúthis‚Äù will work.  No less than the designer when creating, say, a site. <br><br>  Unfortunately, not everyone understands this.  Especially the ‚Äúdirectors-customers‚Äù of the product, who, as a rule, have their own clear ‚Äúconditionally correct‚Äù vision of what he wants to receive. <br><br>  Where do directors come from?  Anyone who can quickly make management decisions - he is a potential director.  Making decisions, he gets used to the fact that these decisions are correct - otherwise you can immediately blame yourself.  So, hiring a development company, he very clearly understands what he wants and what he wants is just that and nothing else.  It is sad that sometimes he cannot even correctly convey this - we all know a lot of jokes from the ‚Äúlaughter through tears‚Äù series about this.  Therefore, the programmer has to do the work, and then redo it, redo it and redo it, and so on - simply because there is a ‚Äúdirector‚Äù who pays money for it.

      A programmer is pretty much demotivating.  Here you carry out the task, even if it is set very competently, and already, it would seem, you go to the finish line - as the terrible moment of delivery and reception comes.  And begins a series of negotiations, when you need to redo some small things, often not very adequate, just to get your money.  And if suddenly it turns out that at the stage of setting the task there were ‚Äúmisunderstandings‚Äù, then in general such a thing begins that the carcass is light.  You try, work on the project, and then they say to you, ‚ÄúIt seems to be cool here.  Make me like here. ‚Äù  And then "No, it's not like that, let's be different."  And the story begins about ‚Äúdraw me seven red lines‚Äù ... The thin mental organization of the programmer doesn‚Äôt feel anything good about this approach, and the motivation to work confidently falls on the hyperbola schedule from zero to infinity. <br><br>  Why do programmers live well? <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3ef/ac9/89b/3efac989b871556c102c0e684e6c394c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The secret is simple - we make the product ‚Äúfor ourselves‚Äù, a product that, as WE believe, will be of interest to users.  We do not have such a person who can say: "Guys, you did something wrong, let's redo it."  Our development department decides for itself how and what needs to be done, based on our vision, marketing recommendations, customer feedback and advice from other sympathizers.  We do not have such a "director" who himself does not know what he wants, but can command. <br><br>  We have a roadmap, a big one, big strokes.  We are moving along it at a working pace, without situations ‚Äúa five-year plan in three days.‚Äù  Normal schedule, sometimes more intense, sometimes easier.  There is no reference to specific hours of work - the larks come in the morning, owls - how to sleep, and no one is standing with a stopwatch.  Work goes to scrum - which means teamwork, responsibility for the result, life in the product.  Plan, do, show.  Each team of programmers is sitting in our room.  Around - boards: marker, to discuss, argue, think, and cork - to post important reminders.  We also have our own library, compiled by us, according to our orders, and we regularly replenish it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f0f/a52/295/f0fa52295143192d6562567d2092e8ee.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In order to motivate a creative employee, it is necessary that he himself gets satisfaction from work, so that he understands that he has done something good.  And you can do a good job only on the condition that the one who sets the task for you, thought it over very well and explained it in an accessible way.  This is the main motivation, it even means more than money.  Although we pay well too.  If in numbers, then the salaries are less than 60 tr for our programmers, in principle, does not happen, and this is the bottom bracket.  The top is about 120, and this is with quiet, not nervous work, with a normal schedule. <br><br>  And, another important secret for programmer motivation is that coffee must be good! <br>  This is how we take care of our programmers.  What and all the rest we want.  :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/120277/">https://habr.com/ru/post/120277/</a></p>
