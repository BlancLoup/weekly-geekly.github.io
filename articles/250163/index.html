It all started with programming in Flash, with the development of applications for social networks.  Subsequently, with the expansion of the mobile technology market, with the advent of new platforms, it became interesting and beneficial to plunge into mobile development.  It can be said that mobile development has come automatically with changing market needs. <br><br>  <b>What are the pros and cons of each platform?</b>

      <b>A. B.:</b> All platforms have their advantages and disadvantages, and it is unequivocally to single out a specific platform and say that it is best, this is probably wrong, because  the existence of a sufficient number of platforms currently confirms the fact that they are all necessary.  Each platform brings income and benefits to certain groups of people: both application users and developers themselves.  Some companies are developing only Android applications, others only iOS, and still others are trying to build native applications on both iOS and Android.  As for our company, we cover the maximum number of platforms and audiences, respectively, using various cross-platform mobile application development solutions. <br><br>  <b>How to choose a platform for which it is better to develop an application?</b> <br><br>  <b>AB:</b> Business owners are now repelled by the analytical data on their site‚Äôs traffic: simply comparing the number of users visiting their site and choosing to develop a mobile application for the platform from which the largest number of users access them.  However, it would be better to develop a cross-platform application that will be simultaneously available to all user groups on the most popular platforms now: Android, iOS, Windows Phone.  The reason for this decision is the constant increase in the number of users of all three platforms, which according to analysts' forecasts will increase by 2.5 times by 2020. <br><br>  <b>And what are the advantages of cross-platform application development?</b> <br><br>  <b>AB:</b> Here is an unambiguous plus in the fact that by making an application once it can be extended to several platforms.  Using the example of Unity and Marmelade shells and frameworks, we make a single application: a single code is written - basic, and then this code is converted into an application that will work fine on iOS devices, and on Android, Windows Phone, and even BlackBerry 10. But that's not all: a cross-platform application will also be available in social networks from a user profile on facebook, vkontakte, odnoklassniki - without losing results!  If you take as an example e-commerc√© industry - an online store, then making an order from a mobile application, and then using the site itself or an application from a social network, the user will reflect his personal account, with a basket and the goods he ordered from a mobile application.  The only disadvantage of cross-platform application development is, perhaps, the need to stabilize and adapt the application for the end user on different platforms, but this work usually takes 1-2 days.  In any case, we do not develop 10 products in parallel, we make one application available on all platforms, saving time and money, reaching the maximum audience, and due to this we benefit.  Summarizing the above, besides the fact that a business owner can cover all user groups, thereby expanding the business model, increasing the conversion of his business, developing cross-platform applications will cost less and take much less time than developing a native application for just one platform, and then porting it to everyone else.  Marketers, as well as business owners know that if you do not have time to reach your audience, someone else will do it for you and your target group will go to another supplier of goods / services.  Therefore, we have to admit the realities of our time: if a business does not currently have a mobile application, then it is already the loser. <br><br>  <b>And what advantages does a mobile app bring to business?</b>  <b>Why should companies order the development of mobile applications?</b> <br><br>  <b>AB:</b> Everything is simple: the world does not stand still.  Everything is moving forward, technical progress in the world is moving very fast and therefore the development of a mobile application for business now plays an important role.  Let's return to our example of the e-commerce industry: develop a mobile application for an online store that directly displays the same online store and can make purchases.  In this case, you can expand the audience of users, increase sales, get more profit.  If you also connect your marketing, the mobile application can also be used as a clever reputation management tool - to incline users to choose your product, to hold the ‚Äúhand‚Äù of each consumer by launching push notifications, which also contribute to purchases and increase sales on average by themselves by 15-20%.  Here, an important role is also played by the integration of the application with social networks, where the application can already be used as a tool to promote the business itself. <br><br>  <b>Does the application provide more business opportunities?</b> <br><br>  <b>AB:</b> Yes.  In the case of an online store, this is an expansion of the audience, its attraction through a mobile application.  In the case of other businesses - besides attracting new users - additional income: advertising in the application, for example.  In fact, there are a great many ways to monetize the application, which can bring additional business income in the amount of approximately + 70%. <br><br>  <b>Mobile application development services are provided not only by companies, but also by individual freelance developers.</b>  <b>Why is it still more profitable to use the services of the company?</b> <br><br>  <b>AB: A</b> freelancer is a person who can afford to move away from work schedule, he can get very sick, dramatically abyss, and therefore there are no guarantees in terms of delivery of the product, guarantees of delivery in general and the product in principle.  If before everything was in words, now with freelancers enter into formal contracts and there are specialized services, where freelancers really value their reputation.  And a good freelancer will never let your customer down.  But here it is important to understand that a freelancer is one combat unit.  And the company guarantees 100% order fulfillment, because there are a certain number of specialists in its reserves.  And in case of failure of one person, there is a whole team that works on this order, which by itself is the guarantor of the order.  Therefore, the team - it is an indisputable fact of the order compared with freelancing.  In addition, we always involve in the development of the application specialists in the field of user interaction to create a competent and effective interface of the application.  Indeed, lately, in addition to the functional user convenience is becoming increasingly important.  In this regard, a well-designed interface is often the key to success in retaining the user in the application and maximum conversion of the lead into the client! <br><br>  <b>Are there any difficulties that the customer will have to face if he turned to a professional?</b> <br><br>  <b>AB:</b> The difficulty can only be that a clear statement of the problem is required of any customer, that is, the development company must receive clear requirements.  Often the customer does not know what he wants to receive.  In this case, a professional company must offer its solutions: to attract its business analyst to study the goals and specifics of the customer‚Äôs business, analyze the behavior of the audience to create the highest quality product that will satisfy both the customer and users of the product and bring the maximum income to the customer‚Äôs business.  As for our team, we work with the installation: to make the highest quality and really cool product that will be pleasant to use and which will bring the maximum profit to the customer.  Many companies can develop a mobile application, but a rare software company delves into the customer's business, analyzes its specifics and audience at the proper level, and provides a product that will really work and bring benefits. <br><br>  <b>What you need to do so as not to "burn out" with a mobile application?</b> <br><br>  <b>AB:</b> Before, 3-4 years ago, it was almost impossible to burn out.  By releasing a mobile application with high probability one could argue that this application will earn enough money if it comes out immediately qualitative and thoughtful.  Now, with every year, month, week, it is becoming more and more difficult to be issued due to the saturation of the market.  That is why it is important to take very seriously the creation of an application at the design stage.  To know a huge number of audience management secrets that we have worked out and tried out in practice with many of our customers during all the years of our work, connect special application monetization modules, be in the trend of the mobile application market.  Our team has a whole staff of analysis and research of user reactions, hypothesis testing, and continuous improvement of user interaction with the application. This is what, in addition to thoughtful functionality, you need to pay great attention.  And here you can not do without accumulated experience. <br><br>  <b>If you have questions - ask!</b>  <b>We will be happy to answer them in subsequent interviews!</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cb3/906/a3b/cb3906a3b5644e6b956dacb3d1460c4a.jpg"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/250163/">https://habr.com/ru/post/250163/</a></p>
