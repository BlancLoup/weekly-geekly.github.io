  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Self-motivation is a myth.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Like many, reading Habr and literature, which is dedicated to motivation and effective work, I constantly face chewing the same myths. <br>  Unfortunately, the understanding that you are faced with a myth comes a little later.  The most dangerous thing about it is a waste of time.  Everything can be returned, everything can be fixed.  Except time. <br>  I would like to hope that people like me who read Habr believe that they do not waste their time, but use it most effectively. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So, I wrote about the purpose of the article, but the repetition is the mother of learning, therefore: ‚ÄúThe article is devoted to increasing motivation and efficiency by debunking myths about this very motivation.‚Äù <br>  <b>1. The myth of the proper organization of the working space.</b> <br>  Do you really think that ICQ, classmates and the absence of distracting details increase your productivity?  Or maybe it's just excuse? <br>  For myself?  What, for example, does the sound of the radio interfere with?  Or ICQ?  Or classmates? <br>  I will give an example with a juggler, who begins to juggle with two balls, then three and a little later goes to four I and five balls. <br>  So a person, the same juggler, at first he starts writing a program or preparing a commercial offer, launches ICQ and classmates, i.e.  immediately takes three goals.  And as a result, the program is not written in time or commercial offer with errors.  Balls begin to crumble on the floor.  Therefore, getting used to work in several applications and doing several things at the same time you only increase your productivity. <br><br>  <b>2. Myth of the daily routine.</b> <br>  After reading several books, having gone to more than one time management training, I was always surprised how did they manage to sell their time in exchange for the money and time of other people?  Maybe this is the correct use of their time? <br>  Yes, of course not.  They tell us, get up at six, go to bed at nine.  Eat two, work from 10 to 11. <br>  The erroneous idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe routine is that a person is affected by a bunch of small things called life.  All plan will not succeed.  For example, you, as an intelligent person, have made a plan for yourself that you strictly follow.  Then, once, overslept.  Then, since I watched a movie with a girl until one o'clock in the morning, or didn‚Äôt watch ... Everything  The whole plan goes on smarka. <br>  Organically distribute the force, this is more relevant.  By studying your strengths and weaknesses, you can make good use of your time.  Even laziness can be turned into dignity. <br><br>  <b>3. You can motivate money.</b> <br>  Each of us getting a job goes there for two main interrelated things.  This is experience or money.  Or as Robert Kiosaki said ‚ÄúFear and Greed‚Äù. <br>  Gaining experience, becoming more greedy, changing their experience for money.  The system seems simple, but in fact it works the first time.  As soon as the needs of the first round are closed (food, safe housing, clothes ...) money ceases to be a motivating factor.  If an employee is offered a salary three times higher than what he currently receives at 20 years of life and say: ‚ÄúSon, you will have only this salary for the rest of your life if you sign a lifetime contract.‚Äù  One hundred percent a person will refuse.  Although it would seem - he was offered a three-fold larger package!  The fact is that a person has a constant thought that he deserves more, it‚Äôs all because he is constantly changing, getting smarter, becoming more experienced.  This is completely normal.  Therefore, we must move to where there is more experience and knowledge.

      <b>4. Delegation of authority.</b> <br>  People who have received (purchased) an MBA degree often look funny in their own little world, which they create themselves or they are helped by teachers. <br>  I constantly hear from them: ‚ÄúMisha, entrust all the tasks that other people can perform on these very other people, you will have plenty of time that you will spend more effectively.‚Äù  From myself I can add that it looks very attractive, but people are not fools too. <br>  Mom was forced to wash the dishes, we reluctantly agreed, went to the sink and started to rub the dishes with a sour face, we did it very badly, and when Mom came and saw this dish, she expelled us and washed herself. " <br>  By delegating authority to others, we act like our mother.  We wash dishes for careless children.  We are at risk of entrusting the fulfillment of certain tasks; this risk can only be avoided if the person is pleased to perform this task.  This is possible if a person, for example, wants to gain experience while completing a task.  We can only check the result here.  The rule is you want the work to be done well, do it yourself. <br><br>  On this, of course, the myths do not end and if the article seemed interesting, of course there will be a continuation. <br>  So I say goodbye. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/42393/">https://habr.com/ru/post/42393/</a></p>
