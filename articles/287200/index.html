  <section class="page js-page"><h1>News Corp. plans to create a new national electronic newspaper for tablets and mobile phones</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/5b/d5/5bd5968bdf1d1093b4d4cee181bcc846.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  If you remember, not so long ago a huge amount of various kinds of media published amazing news - Rupert Murdoch, the head of News Corp., is going to make content on the sites of publications that are part of the corporation paid.  Prior to this, almost all large and small media earned on their sites through advertising.  Murdoch really didn‚Äôt like the fact that the content created by first-class journalists, goes for free ‚Äúon the hands‚Äù, and it also translates into Google News.  As a result, access to the publications did become paid, and Google also made a deal with News Corp., returning the news from the publications of this media corporation to its news aggregator.  In general, we can say that the idea of ‚Äã‚Äã79-year-old Murdoch, if not become extremely successful, did not fail, as many believed.  This time the media tycoon decided to create a paid electronic newspaper for the USA, which would be ‚Äúpublished‚Äù for tablet PCs and other mobile devices. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  The new edition will offer its readers short, interesting stories and news.  Murdoch believes that this newspaper, which has not yet been named, will become popular among fans of electronic devices, who work with information "on the fly."  Now, according to many experts, the audience of ordinary newspapers is gradually ‚Äúgetting older‚Äù, as young people and middle-aged people are becoming more and more used to receiving information via the Internet, which is much more convenient than newspapers.  Murdoch believes that the new e-newspaper will attract young people who practically do not read paper newspapers.

      Murdock, by the way, believes that iPad tablet PCs in general will form new habits and standards of reading, as was done by the same iPod. <br><br>  As mentioned above, the new newspaper will offer its readers short news and reviews that can be quickly read, having a general idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhat is happening in the world and the United States (the newspaper is still national).  Murdoch is already ready to invest millions of dollars in the creation of a new publication - the money will be spent on attracting professional journalists, acquiring the necessary technical basis and other items of expenditure.  Unfortunately, at least the approximate date of commencement of work on a new media project is still unknown. <br><br>  But it is known in what form the publication will exist - for each of the supported device types (as long as the exact list is also unknown), a special application will be distributed, which will provide the best reading mode for each specific device.  Interestingly, Murdoch also plans to monetize the publication through additional advertising.  The exact cost of a subscription to a new edition is also still unknown, but most likely, the price of a subscription will be approximately equal to the cost of a subscription to the Wall Street Journal via iPad ($ 4 per week). <br><br>  <a href="http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-ct-newscorp-20100813,0,3467576.story">A source</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/287200/">https://habr.com/ru/post/287200/</a></p>
