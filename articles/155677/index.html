  <section class="page js-page"><h1>About IT motivation</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In this article I will address the issue of motivation in IT, and from a perspective that can hardly be found in the classic works on economics.  Everything described here is my personal opinion, based on work in various IT companies and communication with various IT specialists. <br><br>  The topic of the article came after reading the report rabota.ua, in which there are research results indicating that for most IT people, the main motivator is salary.  It seems everything is clear and understandable, but let's look at the problem deeper. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Motivation in the classics </h4><br><br>  You are all certainly familiar with Maslow's pyramid:

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b91/12e/8a5/b9112e8a58d9093271db5a68f159cce4.gif"><br><br>  <i>The basis of the theory of motivation (pyramid) Maslow is the thesis that human behavior is determined by a number of basic needs that can be built in a certain hierarchy.</i>  <i>From the point of view of Maslow, these needs are universal, i.e.</i>  <i>unite all people regardless of color, nationality, lifestyle, habits, manners, and other external manifestations.</i>  <i>Maslow's hierarchy of needs is built on the principle of the urgency of their satisfaction for man.</i> <br><br>  If you look closely at this image, the "development", "personal growth" are at the very top of the pyramid.  This can simply explain the fact why very few people really steal on the topic of personal and personal growth.  After all, you still need to reach the top of the pyramid ... <br><br>  But in fact, in the real world, things are a little different, especially in the IT world, especially in our IT world. <br><br><blockquote>  - Nothing personal, it was just a business. <br>  - For me, it was very personal. <br><br>  The film "Hostage" (Taken), 2008 &lt; </blockquote><br><br>  How often have you heard the phrase ‚Äújust business, nothing personal‚Äù?  Personally, I have heard this phrase many times in my life.  And each time this phrase sounded exactly when people who did not fulfill their promises tried to find an excuse for their actions. <br><br>  Not surprisingly, after two or three situations, the person next time will behave in the same way.  That is why ( <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/145960/">I have already said this</a> ) high-class specialists are difficult to lure with the help of tennis tables, insurance and other "buns" (if you can still - check the applicant's professional level again!). <br><br><blockquote>  When IT companies refuse to make a profit, I agree that wages should not be the main motivator for their employees. <br><br>  My, although I may have heard it before </blockquote><br><br>  But many sincerely surprised that a person comes to work to make money.  They do not understand why some employees are not ready to spend the night for three days in a row at work for the ‚Äúdream company‚Äù. <br><br>  I feel hot when another IT company starts to prove how the company cares for the IT situation, appreciates its employees, cares for the environment, etc.  Especially infuriates the situation when the company is trying to add a touch of elitism in its activities for the benefit of mankind.  And then again you hear: nothing personal ... <br><br>  Football game commentators have a wonderful phrase: ‚Äúthe game is forgotten, the score remains.‚Äù  So it is here: no matter how great a company is, the only measure of ‚Äúhappiness‚Äù for its creators and the board of directors is a positive quarterly report or the amount of cash in a bank in Cyprus.  Therefore, it is not surprising that employees come to ‚Äúwork a job‚Äù and for this they want to ‚Äúget paid‚Äù. <br><br><h4>  A few more words about the size of the stock and badges </h4><br><br>  I have already said this many times, but I repeat: we all love to be measured with hypothetical titles: Senior F * ing Developer, Senior Double F * ing Developer, NuProstoPizezKakoi Senior Developer.  Well, you understand ... A lot of people in each company.  So, here we get a double facepalm: a company can sell one specialist for the price of two, and the developer is ready not to get a tangible profit for the sake of being able to flaunt a cool title. <br><br>  I won‚Äôt go far - he was at first juna, then senor, then middle, then senor again, then I came up with such a badge that I still cannot pronounce it ... I think it‚Äôs not necessary to say that my professional level correlated weakly with badges . <br><br>  And the biggest shit in my life I felt at one of the ‚Äúbusiness‚Äù parties, when a 21-year-old third-year student of the KPI handed me a business card with the words ‚Äúbusiness development manager‚Äù ... <br><br>  And further.  Solve a simple puzzle.  There is one developer who works from 8 am to 9 pm.  For this, he receives a salary of N. Nearby sits a senior developer who works from 11 am to 6 pm with a lunch break.  For this, he receives a salary of 2 * N.  There is a certain hypothetical problem that the first developer solves in 1 day, and the second developer - in 15 minutes.  Question: where to take a magic kick, which you need to reward managers of the company, so that they finally understand why the second developer should receive more than 2 * N? <br><br>  If you think this is a hypothetical task, then you are mistaken. <br><br><h4>  Motivation, money and science </h4><br><br>  Science is another area where standard theories of motivation do not work.  Do you all remember Perelman, who proved the Poincar√© theorem and then abandoned the honestly earned million dollars?  Many simply refused to understand what was happening, and even more people still believed in the approaching end of the world. <br><br>  In fact, everything is much simpler.  A person is unlikely to make a revolution in science if he does it for money.  No, it is possible to do something brilliant for money (although history knows many examples when a thing or invention was recognized as ingenious a long time after the actual invention or even the death of the author), but the revolution is unlikely. <br><br>  Maybe because of this, because of the latest revolutions, we only have instagram and facebook? <br><br><blockquote>  When I was 7 years old, I dreamed that communism would triumph over the whole earth.  At seventeen, I dreamed of unearthly love and a beautiful princess.  Now I am 35, and I stupidly want MONEY! </blockquote><br><br>  One should not forget that each person has his own views, beliefs, desires, family and moral status.  To offer everyone the same social package is, in my opinion, stupid. <br><br>  For example, <br><ul><li>  we have tennis tables!  (and the man had a deuce in physical education and the hands of his assholes grow, but just in such a way as to properly code in PHP); </li><li>  we have a pool!  (and a person does not know how to swim); </li><li>  we have free English courses!  (and the person already speaks English well); </li><li>  we have‚Ä¶ </li></ul><br>  But one needs a parking lot and a shower, another needs to leave work one hour earlier, because it‚Äôs far to get, and the third needs a mouse with a Mickey Mouse sticker.  And, in my opinion, before taking a person to work, you need to ask if he needs all these ‚Äúbuns‚Äù.  Put in front of him a list of buns with two free graphs and ask them to indicate that they really need one of them.  Or ask 10 points to choose any 5. I think you will be surprised at the results ... <br><br><blockquote>  I love summer, but recently I realized that summer could be all year round, there would be money!  Now I love money! </blockquote><br><br>  In order not to be accused of greed, I still want to add a few thoughts on how to raise motivation among employees without material things. <br><br>  The first thing people need after money is recognition.  Many are eager to be the boss, but not grown.  Ok, you can put this person as a leader of a group of interns. <br><br>  Conduct corporate - do not invite music groups from the outside, take your own or invite from neighboring companies.  Not only is it cheaper, people will also be impressed for a whole month. <br><br>  Remove all stupid still lifes and all garbage in the style of garbage surrealism, hang pictures and photos of their employees.  The same garbage, but its own <br><br>  Etc.  No pools and tennis tables will replace the usual human relationship.  True. <br><br>  And finally, the accordion in the subject. <br><br>  <i>The bottom line: in the head office of the company decided to hold an attraction of unprecedented tolerance.</i>  <i>Decided to arrange a gay festival of representatives from all offices.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>The distribution list came to the office - send 3 gays.</i>  <i>Management thought hard.</i>  <i>They called a meeting, they began to think.</i>  <i>Invented.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>A decree was issued: heads of divisions, who achieved the lowest results for the quarter, go to the gay parade.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Such a production, sales, marketing, advertising, supply, the company has never seen - productivity increased by 100% and higher.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>And the management achieved its results - they got a profit, and chose fagots.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>And you say - awards, training, career growth, company anthems.</i>  <i>Bullshit this all.</i> <br><br>  Have a nice job! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/155677/">https://habr.com/ru/post/155677/</a></p>
