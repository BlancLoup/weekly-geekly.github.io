  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Skype has released a version for business</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  It's no secret that Skype is used not only by home users, but also by various representatives of small and medium businesses.  In this regard, Skype has released a version for business.  What she is, I'll tell you. <br><br>  So.  Skype for business.  It consists of two components.  Actually Skype itself and the control panel on skype.com. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Skype itself does not have any differences from the usual.  Its only advantage is that its installer comes in the form of a full msi package.  Full - it means that during its installation Skype does not try to download all of its latest distribution from the Internet.  msi package allows you to install Skype on workstations with MS Windows using Group Policy (GPO).  Those.  if you have a large network, but there is an AD infrastructure, then you will not need to run around the office.  There are no more differences in distributions.

      Go to the panel.  Anyone can register here.  No extras.  no data needed.  Actually, you do not need to register if you already have Skype.  After entering the panel, you will be prompted to enter the name of the organization and other thingies.  After that you can start adding users to your organization.  One is already there - you.  You can also create new accounts directly from the panel.  You can send invitations to register in Skype on the entered list of E-mails. <br><br>  From words to practice.  I didn't manage to invite someone.  Invitations simply did not come by mail.  When I clicked on the button to see the text of the invitation, which would be sent, there was the text of the invitation of the test user to the test company, with a proposal to follow the link.  I followed the link, but this invitation was no longer valid.  Apparently since testing, this feature has not started working.  However, if you sign in to the Skype control panel on the site, then there will be an invitation to "become a member of the Skype for Business panel."  Finally, I found a way to connect users.  But he is certainly far from ideal. <br><br>  The panel administrator gets the ability to edit user data: First Name, Last Name, Title.  Unfortunately, as I understand it, this data is not updated in the user's skype data, but is only needed to identify and group users in the dashboard for business.  Very sorry.  It would be convenient to edit user data from the web interface, rather than run around the office. <br><br>  Of course, you can replenish the account of the company.  This is done by the same methods as Skype recharge.  You can use pre-paid cards. <br><br>  There is a function of working with online numbers.  Online numbers are numbers, calling to which the subscriber will get to the skype you specified.  Such numbers can be bought only in some countries.  In total there are about 25 of them, and Russia and the CIS countries are not included in this number.  However, if your business has a representative office, for example in the USA, then this function can be quite useful for you. <br><br>  I don‚Äôt know how to allocate numbers to users, because I didn‚Äôt buy them.  Nevertheless, from the written on the site, I can assume that the numbers can be assigned at least to the user.  It is even possible for a user group, as in a mini PBX. <br><br>  There is still an opportunity to make reports on the money spent.  I also could not evaluate it, but I think that everything is all right with her. <br><habracut></habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/68464/">https://habr.com/ru/post/68464/</a></p>
