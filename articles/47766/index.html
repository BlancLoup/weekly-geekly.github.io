The heyday of this culture in Russia.  And while the bubble has not burst yet publish the December ranking of the best startups of the month.

Perhaps the first such reality show of such magnitude in Russia.  And maybe that's why the guys are not everything turns out.  They managed to loudly declare themselves, but their chosen idea, and changing conditions along the way, had a negative impact on the project‚Äôs reputation.  However, they are the first, and I think they are great. <br><br>  <b>Vitaly Akimov (Developer):</b> <i>‚ÄúIn general, with the help of the project‚Äú Startup for a week, ‚ÄùI want for the shortest time, at the lowest cost, to roll out the project for a viability test.</i>  <i>In contrast to the heavy sluggish startups that are made for millions of rubles / dollars, over the years, most of which never get started with the most remarkable and polished idea, multi-volume TZ, etc.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>And pah-pah, as long as everything goes according to plan (albeit with a slight lag), and most importantly, we receive the most important feedback from the target audience. ‚Äù</i>
