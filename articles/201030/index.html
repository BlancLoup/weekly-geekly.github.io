Even if you have found a person who speaks very confidently at the interview, the most interesting begins in the first working days.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Where did the idea for the course come from </h4><br>  It often happened that a person who even claimed the role of lead developer did not actually know the basics of team work with business projects.  And this is not only the fault of the specialist himself, but also of his previous employers, where the development was carried out according to the ‚ÄúAdHoc management‚Äù methodology. <br><br>  As a result, our team leaders and technical dealers had to spend several weeks training the person what we considered to be the basics: <br><ul><li>  using version control system </li><li>  working with the three-tier architecture test-stage-prod </li><li>  general principles of teamwork </li></ul><br>  Many similar heads of Internet companies tell us about similar words, which is why we decided to take a short <a href="http://kursrik.ru/lectures/promyshlennaya-php-razrabotka/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr">course in immersion in industrial PHP development</a> . <br><br>  Details about the program, teacher and course format you can read on his page.  I will dwell briefly on the most interesting: <br><ul><li>  The course consists of two classes with an interval of a week. </li><li>  At the first lesson, theoretical knowledge is given, laboratory work is carried out, and large homework is given. </li><li>  A week break between classes is just needed to perform a DZ </li><li>  The second lesson is devoted to the analysis of homework and questions that have arisen in the course of the application of knowledge.  In the remaining time there will be bonus labs. </li></ul><br><br><h4>  How to teach a turkey to fly? </h4><br>  We recently found a good parable about education: <br>  ‚ÄúOnce, one turkey decided to make courses for other turkeys so that they could learn to fly.  The first version of the course consisted of theoretical studies.  Graduates are gone after classes on foot.  In the second version of the courses, turkeys really tried to fly around the audience.  But after class, we left again on foot. ‚Äù <br><br>  We want our graduates to fly even after the courses.  That is why we have made a format in which the homework for the application of new knowledge and its subsequent analysis is an obligatory part of the master class.  First, the inevitability of public speaking and homework motivates the people to do it well and show themselves well done.  Secondly, after performing the DZ, people have specific questions to the teacher.  This is a very important point, because usually students have very few questions to the coach, and they are some kind of abstract.  And all the most interesting in education is transmitted precisely in random backstage conversations, in the analysis of practical subtleties.  We decided to give people the ground for a conversation and make backstage conversations a natural part of the class. <br><br>  In general, in our opinion, wisdom is applied knowledge realized after application. <br>  We are for wisdom, and knowledge can be viewed free on Wikipedia :) <br><br><h4>  Feedback </h4><br>  Our tmlid course is more of a management project, so Industrial PHP is our first developer course.  Please tell us in the comments or me on g@kursrik.ru: <br><ul><li>  What do you think is wrong in this course, questionable or not at all necessary? </li><li>  Is the format of short intensives convenient or the developers do not believe in it and you need long marathons? </li><li>  What topics are most acute in terms of training? </li></ul><br>  Our company is small, so we are very flexible and can quickly respond to the interests of the people, look for the right coaches and prepare useful courses. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/201030/">https://habr.com/ru/post/201030/</a></p>
