  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Two-legged stool named after Henry Ford</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Speculation.  The biggest problem is branding.  And with it, and design.  The lion's part of the creative work is performed on the basis of conjectures.  And this is the main reason why the business stubbornly does not want to take seriously designers, brand managers, PR people, creatives and other creative fraternity. <br><br>  Laziness.  The main reason for speculation.  Errors associated with speculation cost both performers and customers much more expensive in time plan than thoughtful and serious work, but no one wants to think.  ‚ÄúDraw me a logo‚Äù - says the customer.  ‚ÄúEasy,‚Äù says the designer.  And begins, sticking his tongue out, "create." <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Yes, I know.  So it was 7-10 years ago.  The decade was not in vain.  Everyone learned what a technical or creative task is, what a brief is and why a briefing is needed.  So what is next?  The thought did not go further.  We have Paper on hand!  Indulgence from all sins!  Briiiiif. <br><br>  In the course how the word brief is translated?  Exactly.  This is the essence.  But the essence of what?  Well ... this ... client filled out something, his vision.  ABOUT!  For sure.  Vision!  Those.  also speculation.  Designers, PR and marketers, as 10 years ago, continue to fiercely "create creative" on the basis of conjectures.  Only if earlier it was their dear nonsense, now it is a dear customer delusion.  Responsibility shifted, paper signed.  Everyone is happy.  But for some reason no one remembers the brief when the work is approved.  Goals are forgotten, the criteria are mildly modified, the audience is completely sideways.

      And that's fine.  If paper is speculation and fiction, then it can and be ignored.  And what, because it turned out beautifully?  Handsomely.  Well, what for this brief.  Well, we have what we have.  They have learned to draw, b√∂hans is torn, Russian designers have come, snays!  The era of group masturbation on each other.  And for some reason there were no Russian brands, and no.  And all because we are trying to sit on a two-legged stool. <br><br>  No, I do not argue.  The client can and should be asked what he thinks about his target audience, his product and his values.  And the vision of the performer as a professional is also very important.  But only?  Isn't it worth asking the audience what it thinks about the product?  [there should be a significant pause in this place, and then shouts from the audience] Well, this should be carried out, focus groups should be collected.  It is expensive, and long, and in general.  And it will also be speculation, here. <br><br>  You will not believe.  But it is fast and cheap.  And yes, this is speculation.  But these are conjectures of those people who, with their conjectures, then go to the store.  The vision of the performer + the vision of the customer + the vision of the audience = the collective ideal vision of the product.  The opinion of the audience is a necessary third leg at the stool.  Without it, you will sooner or later crash loudly and shamefully from a stool.  What we see everywhere. <br><br>  Steve Jobs said that consumers do not know what they want, so it‚Äôs pointless to ask them about it.  Earlier, Henry Ford said that if he asked what consumers want, they would still ride horses.  Well done, everyone read quotes of great people.  Continue as a zombie to repeat phrases that are torn out of context and time, and it‚Äôs not clear for anyone to produce shitty foods. <br><br>  It does not occur to anyone that one can ask not about the functionality of the product, but about the values ‚Äã‚Äãthat are important for people.  Compare the questions ‚ÄúWhat would you like to move on?‚Äù And ‚ÄúHow fast would you like to move?‚Äù.  Feel the difference?  In the first case, the answer is really "horse."  And in the second?  In the second there will be no specifics.  In the second there will be IDEAS.  Which can be turned into a car, a plane, a rocket, the theory of relativity.  And you can even ask "What is the movement?".  And the brain will explode from the open horizons. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/149367/">https://habr.com/ru/post/149367/</a></p>
