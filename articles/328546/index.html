  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Telegram of your business</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Telegram can help automate any business, even a specific one.  Of the obvious advantages of Telegram is the multiplatform, convenient desktop version, as well as the possibility of expanding the functionality and availability of api. <br><br>  Let's analyze Telegram on the example of such offline business as quests in reality.  To the surprise of Telegram, in just one year of its active use, it is deeply rooted in the DNA of our business and it is already difficult to imagine our business without it. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  An important component of many businesses is constant communication with partners and customers. <br>  Franchising is not an exception, operational support from the whole team is necessary, and it is desirable that everyone has an information footprint. <br><br>  Instant messengers come to mind: free, safe, in every smartphone.  It was necessary to choose from three: Viber, Whatsapp, Telegram.  The messenger allows you to create a chat with a partner, its employees, the support team.  In each individual chat can be only the necessary people.  You can create a link by which new people will join.  All information is conveniently stored in history (a quick search works on Telegram), as well as links and photos are fixed separately, which simplifies the search for information.

      Viber was discarded due to excessive monetization, ‚Äúheaviness‚Äù and cumbersome interface.  Telegram at that time (2014) was not widely known, so the choice was stopped on Whatsapp - fast, convenient, there are voice calls, and one of the main advantages is widespread (you don‚Äôt have to burden the franchisee with unnecessary actions). <br><br>  When the number of partners exceeded 20, and more than 100 quests opened in Russia, it became difficult to control what was happening, at what stage the processes.  There is a need for automation.  Yes, and the desktop version of Whatsapp is not complete - so we switched to Telegram. <br><br><h3>  Saving on SMS and notifications </h3><br>  First of all, we wrote a bot, which is synchronized with the schedule and sends a notification of new bookings to the partner‚Äôs chat.  Thus, we saved about 75% of the cost of SMS notifications (usually a client‚Äôs helmet, quest owner and quest admin, only SMS remained for the client) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/804/297/e09/804297e0952b4a3e8f4abd9082a3fac2.jpg"><br><br>  Administrators at locations do not always have time to pick up the phone and even sometimes forget to call back, often the game costing 2-5 thousand rubles ‚Äúmerges‚Äù by stupidity. <br><br>  About half a year ago we organized a single call center for all the quests of Russia: operators were trained, schedules were compiled, but the question of information storage and, again, automation arises. <br><br>  We developed our own CRM system, where each task arrives in the form of a ticket that the operator must process. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/3df/e94/61c/3dfe9461c819402abb6340e149f016d7.jpg"><br><br>  Each operator step in CRM (for example, confirmation, transfer, cancellation, withdrawal, etc.) automatically notifies the chat in Telegram (where the quest employees and the owner are located).  In this way, they always know what happens to their records.  15 minutes before the start of the game, the bot will remind you, and if the clients are not yet in place, the admin will call and find out where they are lost. <br><br><h3>  Helpdesk support </h3><br>  On the basis of Telegram helpdesk was organized.  Any quest worker or owner can write his request through the ‚Äú/ ask‚Äù command, and she falls to us directly into the ticket system, and is promptly executed by a competent employee. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/f73/84d/057/f7384d057f5a431e824d0dc5d35918db.jpg"><br><br>  It looks like a ticket: you can see from which chat the request is, who sent it, when, who took up the execution. <br><br>  In this case there is a notification of the implementation. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/151/965/09a/15196509a5e74adab7ab4b05db0d93dc.jpg"><br><br>  And this is how the chat looks like after the execution of the request - a notification about the execution arrives and the name of the person who executed it. <br><br><h3>  Newsletters </h3><br>  Periodically, you need to notify partners about innovations, promotions, share experiences, or simply inform.  Manually write everyone else an adventure.  Now we can send useful information to all partner chats at once using the bot / say command. <br><br>  The readability of such messages reaches 100%, in contrast to email newsletters to partners or placing information in the knowledge base on the site (where everyone is usually too lazy to go). <br><br>  Thanks for attention! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/328546/">https://habr.com/ru/post/328546/</a></p>
