It is released, if the global network does not lie, since 2008. <br><br>  This intricate thing is such a "half keyboard", developed, as the manufacturer claims, especially for gamers.  Actually, it is sharpened for them - 25 fully programmable keys with the ability to assign any keyboard shortcuts and any macros to them (arbitrary keystroke sequences and delays between them). <br><br>  Like any self-respecting accessory for gamers, Logitech G13 can save profiles for different games.  Some profiles are stored on a computer, 3 profiles can be downloaded to the device‚Äôs memory if you are going to take it with you to some championship.

      And now the most delicious: Logitech G13 can store profiles not only for games, but also for other applications.  This, in fact, was the reason for the purchase. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Short FAQ for reasons of purchase </h4><br>  Q: Why not take something from a full-size game series? <br>  A: Because there is a full-sized keyboard with a normal left shifto in stock (yes, that's what I don't like Logitech for). <br><br>  Q: What is the point of such a device outside of WoW? <br>  A: In WoW and analogs, I do not play at all.  But the hotkey for a note in MS Word has not yet been studied.  As well as much more.  Here, all these hotkeys are made one - at the same time, chosen by me - button.  Without reassigning it in the application itself. <br><br>  Q: How does this miracle look on the table? <br>  A: Like a half white backlit keyboard.  The backlight color is adjustable.  There is nothing specifically gaming in the appearance of the device. <br><br>  Q: Why not reassign existing keys on an existing keyboard? <br>  A: Because all software does not support Alt + Shift + REMAPs ... <br><br><h4>  Unpacking </h4><br>  It will not be because the packaging of the device was a bit shabby.  I'll tell you in words: it comes in a standard black and green blister, typical of Logitech devices.  Included paper with an invaluable "congratulations to you that you became the owner ...", and a driver disk. <br><br><h4>  Appearance </h4><br>  Primary color is black.  The edging around the keys is dark gray.  In principle, the device is very similar in appearance and color to Microsoft Ergonomic Keyboard 4000. The same color scheme, the same smooth lines.  Moreover, there is even a soft stand under the wrist, but, unlike the Microsoft product, it is made not from ‚Äúyoung dermatin leather‚Äù, but from ordinary rubber.  That, however, does not affect the convenience. <br><br>  Logitech G13 profile is curved.  The middle of the device is raised up, the stand under the wrist and the block of buttons - below.  I had concerns about ease of use, but everything is quite convenient. <br><br>  The bottom of the device is also curved, under the keyboard unit is a metal plate with the letters "G13" extruded on it.  The keyboard stands firmly on 6 legs, 4 of which are in opposite edges of the main unit, and 2 more - under the mini-joystick. <br><br>  Above is a mini-display that supports several applets out of the box, but sometimes it is smart and quick-witted, and it recognizes running programs.  For example, the keyboard recognized Media Player Home Cinema x64, after which its profile was configured for it. <br><br><h4>  Installation process </h4><br>  In principle, nothing complicated - we install the driver and connect the device via usb.  But as they say, there are nuances. <br><br>  <b>First</b> , there are two versions of software on <a href="http://www.logitech.com/ru-ru/434/5123%3Fsection%3Ddownloads">the Logitech site</a> .  One of them is called ‚ÄúLogitech Gaming Software‚Äù, the second is ‚ÄúGamePanel Software‚Äù.  They are almost identical in function, but vary greatly in file size. <br><br>  First, I put the "GamePanel Software".  G13 was defined by the system as a single composite device, a beautiful picture was automatically picked up in the task manager, and this ended the advantages.  In Windows 7 x64, macros were processed somehow every second.  And, for example, in Starcraft 2, they did not work at all. <br><br>  After that, I put Logitech Gaming Software.  The previous version of the software was removed, the system redefined the Logitech G13 as three different devices, erased a beautiful picture from ‚Äúdevices and printers‚Äù, but ... The device finally worked ‚Äúfor all the money‚Äù - macros are worked out everywhere, where necessary, the profiles are switched, some games automatically determined for the remaining profiles are set by hand. <br><br>  It is important that Logitech does not tell us exactly which version of software to install, so we had to study this question on our own experience.  In the old reviews are just screenshots GamePanel, Gaming Software did not exist then. <br><br>  <b>Secondly</b> , the device from Logitech is very picky in terms of power.  At first I plugged it into the connector on the back panel, but it was turned off after about 15 minutes of use.  Enhanced googling showed that this is not a device problem, but, most likely, a usb power problem.  However, the shamanism with these parameters did nothing, and so far the Logitech G13 is quite stable from the connector on the front panel. <br><br>  <b>Thirdly</b> , without drivers, the device works like a regular keyboard (truncated almost to the WASD block).  In this regard, I do not quite understand what a sacred meaning is in storing profiles in the keyboard's memory - it works like a flash drive for transferring profiles.  If she could work without installing software, everything would be even more interesting.  But, unfortunately, there is no such possibility. <br><br><h4>  Logitech Gaming Software </h4><br>  This is what the main window of Logitech Gaming Software looks like: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1e6/9cf/cca/1e69cfcca378c8ae9e4e0cf0942e529d.png" alt="Main window"><br><br>  Below - from left to right: a link to the manufacturer's website, a thumbnail of the device (not pressed, serves for beauty), the main window, setting up the G-keys, setting applets, setting the backlight, selecting profiles for transfer, setting the driver and calling for help. <br><br>  Let's start in order: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b24/da0/93b/b24da093b3a388fbbcb732fe8f0fbab6.png" alt="Profiles"><br><br>  Setting G-keys is, in fact, the main item in the menu.  It is for these settings that such keyboards are purchased.  As I said, all keys and joystick are programmable and equal.  That is, you can specify any actions or their sequences and assign them to any key or joystick. <br><br>  Here are the options the program offers: <br><ol><li>  Keyboard shortcut.  Actually, I do not know what to comment here.  Keyboard shortcut.  Any.  Alt + shift + ctrl + whatever you want. <br></li><li> Composite key.  This, in fact, is the macro.  Keystrokes, their combinations, optionally - also fixing the delays between keystrokes.  Pressing and releasing a key is recorded as two different events. </li><li>  Text message.  Again, an obvious option, but keep in mind that the text message is always entered in the active layout.  For example, if I have the text ‚ÄúLogitech G13‚Äù on my key, then when the Russian layout is active, ‚ÄúDesktop P13‚Äù will be typed. </li><li>  Mouse function.  Mouse emulator  4 scroll directions, single and double click, 5 (!) Mouse buttons. </li><li>  Multimedia.  Standard multimedia rewind / play / pause </li><li>  Special keys.  Window control keys (minimize / maximize and so on). </li><li>  Label.  Actually, a shortcut to the program with standard settings. </li><li>  Function keys.  This is not an F1-F lot, as one might think.  This is a call to a calculator, an email client, and an emulation of the keyboard's M1-M3 buttons. </li></ol><br><br>  The M1-M3 buttons on top of the keyboard allow you to set individual ‚Äúsub-profiles‚Äù and switch them.  Actually, these are three different sets of assignments for keys, united by one application profile.  These modes are marked by the backlight of the M-keys (it is red for the active mode key), and, if desired, you can set a different backlight color for each mode. <br><br>  It is important that the backlight settings are global.  That is, the M1 mode will be highlighted in the selected color in any profile. <br><br>  Five profiles can be loaded into the keyboard, but without drivers, as I said, it will not work. <br><br><h4>  Operating experience </h4><br>  In short - it is nice and comfortable.  Some applications are automatically detected.  Apparently, the Battlefield Bad Company 2 profile was downloaded by the keyboard from the Internet on its own.  Some profiles are assembled manually and launched by the keyboard when you start the corresponding application. <br><br>  Some applications, however, are not defined at all.  The Starcraft 2 profile has to be specified using the keyboard itself - the drivers have not yet learned to see it.  I have not tracked any patterns in the ‚Äúsee - I do not see‚Äù. <br><br><h4>  And the main question: WHY? </h4><br>  Because of the macros.  If you do not think that it is intended for the MMORPG, the Logitech G13 is a fairly convenient tool for the job.  Analog mini-joystick, by the way, is very good at scrolling and rewinding. <br><br>  Actually, on the same Youtube there is a video where the Logitech G13 is used - with a Mac in Adobe Lightroom.  Here it is: <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/v8wTp8lB07I%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhh26g8lq4SdcEYDr9NR0uWn8a2Mig" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  In general, the acquisition is interesting.  But only for quite specific tasks in combination with an irrepressible desire to buy some gadget.  Although his money is definitely worth it. <br><br><h4>  As a conclusion </h4><br>  Photos in the interior: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e02/2be/6ce/e022be6ce39201a8ac0f9671b1efe2b5.jpg" alt="image"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/125461/">https://habr.com/ru/post/125461/</a></p>
