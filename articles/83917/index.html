The reason is a great desire to accumulate all my plans (books, films, trips, purchases) in one convenient place, as well as what I have already seen, read and bought, too.  Trips to other cities and countries would conveniently be marked on the map, books and films in the form of a structured list of genres with ratings and brief opinions written.  And it would be cool if someone (or something) would advise me to do something else on the basis of already done something already.  But first things first… <br><br>  The reason that I decided to put a detailed description of my idea on Habr - I want to know the opinion of Habr users, I want to hear comments, tips, suggestions, ideas on the project, etc. <br><br>  The ideas for the project have not yet been fully drawn up as a plan - much is still spinning in my head, from time to time new ideas appear on the functional ...

      - <h4>  <b>Project plan</b> </h4><br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>1. Formulation of the idea and mission</b> <br><br>  The idea is to provide the user with the opportunity to accumulate all his plans in one place and provide assistance in their implementation. <br><br>  Missions: <br>  - Give the user a place where you can structure all your plans <br>  - Give the user the opportunity to learn more about how to implement their plans <br>  - Give the user the opportunity to promptly communicate with those who have already implemented this “to do” <br>  - To give the user the opportunity to communicate quickly with those who have not yet implemented this “to do” (for example, to cooperate with those who want to realize and live with you in the same city) <br><br>  Example. <br>  I have the following plans: <br>  - jump with a parachute <br>  - go to Japan <br>  - buy iPhone <br><br>  I add information about my plans to my page.  Clicking on the goal I added, I will see: <br>  - users who have already done this (at the top of the list there will be those with whom it is easiest to contact at this time, that is, those users who are currently on their page - “online”) <br>  - companies that provide this opportunity (with prices, rating, location, etc.) <br>  If this is a “go to Japan”, then tour companies that provide this opportunity (with a rating).  If this is “buy an iPhone”, then a list of stores where you can buy this gadget (with prices). <br><br>  It may be necessary to structure the system “tudu” and “dan” into “Books”, “Films”, “Trips”, “Purchases”, etc.  for the correct operation of the recommendation system. <br><br>  <b>2. Formation of the project team</b> <br><br>  1. Head <br>  2. Programmer <br>  3. Layout designer <br>  4. Designer <br>  5. The advertiser <br>  6. Advertising Manager <br>  7. Moderator <br><br>  This is a necessary minimum. <br><br>  <b>3. Choosing a domain name</b> <br><br>  The domain name was chosen as follows: <br>  Tododone.ru ("Tudan") <br>  To do / Done - Make / Done <br>  That is, the user account will be divided into two sections: <br>  1. Things to do <br>  2. What has already been done <br>  Besides, “Tududan” sounds interesting. <br>  - I heard a new service appeared with a funny name - “Tududan” <br>  - I right now on Tadudane <br>  - What are you doing?  I'll do it! <br>  :-) <br><br>  In addition, you need to register the following domain names: <br>  Tododone. ** (all free in other zones) <br>  And take into account various errors in the set: tododon.ru, tododan.ru, tododane.ru, etc. <br><br>  <b>4. Motivational system for users</b> <br><br>  There are several ways to encourage users to fill out their accounts. <br>  1. 1st level.  It will be possible to use the service only after filling in a certain number of required fields (Name, surname, gender, place of residence, etc.) <br>  2. 2nd level.  Add to friends, view information of other users will be possible only by specifying a certain number of “tudu” and “dans” (for example, 10 each), specifying more detailed information about the “danes” (a small comment about what was done, setting certain ratings, etc. ).  The more “tudu” and “dans” and the more detailed information about it, the higher the participant's rating becomes. <br>  3. Participant rating is also formed by other participants.  Helped someone in the consultation, get from him "an" in the rating (and maybe "coins" in virtual currency, if a decision is made to use it). <br>  4. Also, the rating will be formed due to the ratings for comments, written reviews, uploaded photos, videos. <br>  5. In the network you need to think about the elements of the game.  What it can be is a separate topic. <br><br>  <b>5. Recommended system for users</b> <br><br>  1. The system should take into account the peculiarities of the user's life based on his “tudu and dan” areas.  If he has the most “tudu” from the “Sport” section, then he should be recommended by the “tudu” (formed by other users) from the same section.  If a user has to “jump with a parachute” in a “dane”, then he should be offered to try “rope-jumping”, “rafting” and other kinds of extreme sports. <br><br>  That is, for this you can select a separate page with the fact, “What would you like to try new?”.  This page should be divided into short-term (“What would you do tonight?”) And long-term “tudes” (“What would I like to do on the next vacation?”). <br><br>  2. On the page with his “Tudu” and “Danes” there should also be sentences with similar “Tudu” and “Danes”. <br>  3. If the user should “try” “try sambuka”, then you need to show the rating, formed by users, of the best sambuk.  And again - a way to get it. <br>  4. In the plans: to have for each section in addition to the usual advisers (users) and experts - experts in their field. <br><br>  <b>6. Standard network features</b> <br><br>  Of course, the network should have the following standard functions: <br>  1. Your blog <br>  2. Its page with photos <br>  3. Own video page <br>  4. Ability to add friends <br>  5. Internal mail (implemented as IM) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/83917/">https://habr.com/ru/post/83917/</a></p>
