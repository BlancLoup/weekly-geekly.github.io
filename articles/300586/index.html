  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What is the most important thing for IT vacancies for you, without which you will not respond to it?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  A week ago, we published our <a href="https://megamozg.ru/company/moikrug/blog/25835/">small study</a> , which confirmed the hypothesis that IT vacancies that contain wages are more likely to respond.  And the size of the specified wage does not matter - the main thing is that it should just be immediately indicated. <br><br>  We decided not to dwell on the statistics we collected on the vacancies posted on <a href="http://moikrug.ru/">My Circle</a> and went further: we conducted a sociological survey among IT professionals from the Habr community.  We asked them a question: <i>‚ÄúWhat is the most important thing for you in a vacancy, without which you will not respond to it?‚Äù.</i> <br><br>  At the moment, more than 400 people took part in the survey, and it is hardly likely that the results will change dramatically with the increase in the number of respondents.  So show them to you!

We pay close attention of our employers to this result: always try to indicate the salary in your vacancy, it is not necessary to indicate it precisely, you can also indicate the range of possibilities: ‚Äúfrom and to‚Äù. <br><br></li><li>  For a large majority, namely for 66%, the description of <b>working conditions</b> in a vacancy is critical.  So do not be lazy to remember and collect in the job description the best that you have in the office, work schedule, the surrounding urban infrastructure, etc. <br><br></li><li>  For the majority, 55% of the respondents, the description of the <b>technologies</b> used in the work is extremely important.  The technologies used on My Circle are indicated not only in the job description, but also in the required skill tags.  The latter is also extremely important so that we can recommend the most qualified specialists for you. <br><br></li><li>  For almost half, 47% of respondents, it is important to know the <b>type of business of the company</b> .  Most likely, this is due to the career expectations of the applicant: are there any opportunities for professional growth within the company?  The company‚Äôs business is described on the company‚Äôs page itself, but it‚Äôs not in the job description that says a few words about it. <br><br></li><li>  For a significant number, 43% of the respondents, it is important to immediately see in which <b>project</b> they will work.  That is, in a vacancy it is important to describe not only the required skills and responsibilities, not only to tell about the company as a whole, but also to show that particular project where you invite a specialist. <br><br></li><li>  <b>The name of the company</b> , that is, its fame, is important only for 29% of respondents.  So if you represent a large well-known company, do not think that only one of its name will attract the most-most to you.  Our survey refutes this view. <br><br></li><li>  <b>The team</b> in which to work is at the very last place among the priorities when choosing a job.  Yes, programmers are more often introverts, do not like to communicate, they need peace and quiet for effective work :-) <br><br></li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/300586/">https://habr.com/ru/post/300586/</a></p>
