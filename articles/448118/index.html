    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/1c/no/d5/1cnod5vo_c1an1llo8t-bx7u1rm.png" alt="image"><br><br>  It would seem that such requests as ‚Äúdrug addiction treatment‚Äù and ‚Äúalcoholism treatment‚Äù are in the TOP 10, there should be applications, at least 1-2 per day.  But they were not.  There were 0 entries. <br><br>  Began to find out the cause.  The traffic was, albeit quite small: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/v9/-3/47/v9-347rbkyrpf8l-bumskqdcenu.png" alt="image"><br><br>  About 140 people visited the site a month.  The calls were really 0. All leads went through the word of mouth.  Began to test the main page.  Tried about 50 options.  Shown here are the ones that were saved in the web archive. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jt/4c/er/jt4cer4qqrepsgezu4grtfg2guk.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/p1/ko/rd/p1kordfjgtoblgzuxl2fz7z0owo.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Just added just such a thing: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wj/am/ab/wjamabqs6r7u1eqgbtagz92ew8e.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Ultimately, the site has decently changed since then, but we are running ahead. <br><br><h3>  The second stage (2-3 months of work) </h3><br>  In the process of testing (about the first 20 options) the result was zero.  It was decided to attract paid traffic.  Needed leads. <br><br>  The first advertising budget was 4,000 rubles. It was included in the promotion budget - 18,000 rubles.  The result was average (1 call in 2 days), but the advertisement paid off, since the average check for basic services was 4,000 p.  and 35 000 r.  The conversion was very high, about 70%. <br><br>  In parallel, work was done on SEO: <br><br>  1. Expanded this.  core.  This is what clustered semantics looks like, which we are constantly updating and expanding (screen from key collector); <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/1l/cn/pz/1lcnpzsesqtncfc4gedhncgh3ie.png" alt="image"><br><br>  2. Under the semantics created texts.  Informational and commercial nature.  In more detail about the features of working with copywriters and specific practical tools I showed in my case " <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/442520/">Savings 300 000r per month on contextual advertising"</a> ; <br><br>  3. Purchased links.  Worked through gogetlinks.net.  In the month of 8-12, each ~ 500 p .; <br><br>  4. We tried to buy a through banner on an information themed website with 10k + traffic per article per day.  I told the pros and cons of such a placement in the case ‚ÄúFrom 0 to 81% of semantics in the TOP in 2 days‚Äù.  In cases with our site, the effect was almost zero. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wx/f-/ew/wxf-ewibdmofxazt1s0lgconksu.png" alt="image"><br><br>  For a month, from the site alko03.ru (it was there that link was purchased) there were only 6 transitions.  Unfortunately, I don‚Äôt remember the cost, but around 5,000 r. <br><br><h3>  Stage 3 </h3><br>  In the fourth month of work, the results for the positions were as follows: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/lv/u7/dk/lvu7dkwlkliql_e-oraqjfp4iku.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Almost all requests (which we initially discussed with the client) were displayed in the TOP.  However, applications were still very small.  3-4 calls in 2 days, with a conversion of 70%. <br><br>  It was necessary to expand.  Put forward 2 hypotheses: <br><br><ol><li>  Subdomains to nearby cities will help cover more regional traffic.  There were not many competitors, people from other cities may well come for treatment. </li><li>  Increase the advertising budget and expand the campaign to more requests that have accumulated over several months. </li></ol><br>  Both hypotheses were implemented. <br><br>  <b>Hypothesis # 1 - Subdomains</b> <b><br></b> <br>  We made several subdomains to the nearest cities: Glazov, Votkinsk, Tchaikovsky and Sarapul, as well as several additional subdomains from other regions (Ufa, Kazan, Kirov, etc.).  In addition, unique for each main page. <br><br>  So it looks for the city of Tchaikovsky: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/es/ns/ja/esnsjaut_rv0ju56euo943muxn4.png" alt="image"><br><br>  So for Ufa: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/kr/gy/oz/krgyozwa23bpiwzvg_vpeepyhwq.png" alt="image"><br><br>  We specially inserted the most popular places on the main page to show that our representatives are in these cities.  Of course, we were a little cunning, but often people can come for treatment from any region.  Isolation from the usual environment allows you to concentrate on the problem. <br><br>  The next thing we did was put the subdomains in the TOP in the nearest regions of Udmurtia. <br><br>  Example - Eyes: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/px/rw/1y/pxrw1yrmuqbrt5ivbb00dql-08g.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Example - Tchaikovsky: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/4o/y-/o1/4oy-o15_rnzn2nehxynhnx0akmc.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Thus, we derived approximately 40% of the initial requests to the TOP in all the nearest regions. <br><br>  <b>The results of testing the first hypothesis with subdomains</b> &gt; <br><br><ol><li>  It is very easy to take the TOP in small regions.  Just write down the title, buy a couple of links and uniquely content; </li><li>  TOP by 5 closest regions does not greatly increase the amount of traffic and calls in general; </li><li>  It was not possible to promote subdomains for larger regions.  For this you need to spend more resources on texts, links, etc. </li></ol><br>  Unfortunately, we have not received a real return.  Calls became a little more, but often they were on the service "interruption of binge."  The cost of the service is 4,000-8,000 p.  For her to go to another city is expensive. <br><br>  <b>Hypothesis number 2 - advertising</b> <br><br>  Initially, we already had a small advertising campaign, worked with Yandex and Google.  They created it themselves and did not receive any special ‚Äúexhaust‚Äù.  The goal was to renew it, improve it and launch it on a new one.  Specifically: <br><br><ul><li>  larger budget; </li><li>  greater coverage of semantics. </li></ul><br>  As part of the hypothesis, the following is done: <br><br><ol><li>  Expanded the number of requests, removed unnecessary, in short, ‚Äúcombed‚Äù what was; </li><li>  Since the budget for the Republic of Kazakhstan was allocated from the SEO budget, we distributed requests for 2 campaigns: LF, MF + HF.  In each set a different budget constraint, as I recall, initially it was LF - 600 p., HF - 1 000 p.  in a day; </li><li>  Launched YAN; </li><li>  Designed banners for Yandex homepage.  It is worth noting that clicks from these banners once or twice and obchelsya.  At the same time, it occupies the lion's share of the issue, affects the brand recognition: </li></ol><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ih/xk/6p/ihxk6p5lojqleemmchek1st3txy.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Results of testing hypothesis with advertising</b> <br><br>  The number of applications has increased significantly.  If earlier in 2 days there were only 2-3 applications, now we accepted 3-5 applications per day. <br><br><h3>  Stage 4 - Increase Conversion </h3><br>  With the flow of traffic and an increase in the number of applications, the conversion has dropped.  Began to come cold leads.  Solved the issue with the following tools: <br><br>  1. Inserted through conversion units: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ox/re/me/oxreme8np4oul3fxi7z9ss4tsgi.png" alt="image"><br><br>  2. We put an online consultant (leadback.ru and venyoo) and set up a chat.  Visitors were automatically sent messages to the dialogue: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/e8/h6/d9/e8h6d9jzbdnkz2parg5iv_v0-8s.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/k6/rk/bs/k6rkbsan6icwf6on9wj-st-n2yc.png" alt="image"><br><br>  If the person answered - the message went directly to the client on the phone. <br><br>  Each call through leadback was recorded and subsequently analyzed by the center staff.  From this follows the third point. <br><br>  3. Conducted work with the consultants of the center (those who answer calls).  We introduced minimal communication scripts: ‚ÄúHello, a rehabilitation center, how can we help?‚Äù, Be polite, recommend the most suitable treatment option, try to close for a personal meeting in the center.  As a result, calls have become more productive.  In numbers, it is difficult to say, but it raised the conversion exactly.  And it cost only 30 minutes of time. <br><br>  4. Conducted a photo session of the staff and the interior of the center: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/d6/et/ka/d6etkace8dwkx0b7t4t3hmk5jsw.png" alt="image"><br><br>  For an even greater increase in traffic, they decided to create a campaign by competitors (this is when a person enters the name of a competitor in Yandex, and our advertisement is shown to him) and separately for the service ‚Äúwithdrawal from binge drinking‚Äù. <br><br>  <i>Be careful when working with competitors in an advertising campaign.</i>  <i>We were threatened with the court several times.</i>  <i>Solution - just remove the requests for which there is a complaint.</i> <br><br><h3>  Parallel Stage 4 - SEO </h3><br>  Needed traffic.  After analyzing the issue of the main requests, some interesting patterns were revealed.  In the Udmurt Republic region there were only 4 real competitors (who are in Izhevsk).  Other sites - Ufa, Moscow, Kazan, etc. <br><br>  <b>Conclusion</b> - you need to use a geographical advantage and try to bring your own satellite sites into the TOP (sites with a different design, on a different domain, but with identical services and contacts). <br><br>  A total of 5 such sites were created.  4 of them promoted the ‚ÄúRehabilitation‚Äù service, and one ‚ÄúInterrupt the binge‚Äù service.  Let me remind you, the average check is 35 000 r.  for rehabilitation and 4 000 r.  to interrupt the binge. <br><br>  At the same time, work was carried out with semantics.  Squeezed a maximum of the UR with the help of parsing prompts (key collector) and the base "Bukvariks".  Up to 0 frequency (this is done for ranking by long tails of queries, the topic for a separate article). <br><br>  This is how the queries on the old semantics looked like: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/to/7a/55/to7a55p3mqwy_quhluo68mwfnau.png" alt="image"><br><br>  A beautiful number of 71% unfortunately means little.  After the kernel expansion, the picture is as follows: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zt/bj/l7/ztbjl7xd5pwfxee5pzxudemyn2q.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Already less rosy, but the coverage is several times more. <br><br>  <b>Result on satellites:</b> only one site was shot.  However, this can be considered a success.  Now we had 2 sites in the TOP for the main requests plus direct, banner and Yandex maps. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/58/kv/cs/58kvcs1sdk0uaejiyhi2utqbjfs.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The remaining sites go to the top only on the midrange and woofer.  So that they do not "hang out" just like that, they decided to use in advertising. <br><br>  <i>Please note that in order to advertise several websites on medical topics, you need to write a corresponding letter with a seal to confirm the license.</i> <br><br>  This is how it looks like: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/v9/m3/wo/v9m3wo-qt6dicxjhlnc7_gcwmr0.png" alt="image"><br><br><h3>  Current situation and results </h3><br>  The case shows only 30% of what we tried, the most interesting.  Behind the scenes left: <br><br>  1. Purchase reference weight; <br>  2. Correction of texts (errors, nausea, uniqueness); <br>  3. Negotiations with other centers in order to get local leads; <br>  4. Optimization and promotion of satellites; <br>  5. Crowd marketing, getting free links; <br>  6. ‚ÄúKoldunshchiki Yandex‚Äù, for example, such: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/mu/o6/6p/muo66prukzfjhrrrf-8_wuactgo.png" alt="image"><br><br>  7. Testing chat bot and online consultant.  Color, questions, aggressive pop-ups; <br>  8. Adjustment of advertising campaign.  Remade 18 times at least; <br>  9. Obtaining a license for honey by the center.  activities related to this promotion problem; <br>  10. Features of photo content and its subsequent placement on several sites; <br>  11. Video filming real reviews, posting and optimizing them on YouTube; <br>  12. Details of technical optimization (SSL on subdomains, mobile version, auto-substitution of the header, etc.); <br>  13. Consultation with other centers on SEO and direct.  We actually called and communicated with other specialists; <br>  14. Small details from which you can make a separate article. <br><br>  The situation on the applications at the moment is: <br><br>  The total number of applications per day 5-7, happened to 12-15.  On the leadback come 1-3 per day, these calls can be fixed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/o-/d3/jt/o-d3jtz75rrkxgglgxpljwoavfy.png" alt="image"><br><br><h3>  Future plans </h3><br><ol><li>  Create a series of high-quality videos. </li><li>  Customize end-to-end analytics.  It is necessary to understand where the leads come from, their cost and, on the whole, ‚Äúdigitize‚Äù the work on the Internet. </li><li>  Take 90% of customers from the UR.  At the moment, the market coverage is ~ 40%.  Some part is taken by local competitors ~ 15%, the remaining 45% goes to specialized call centers (which do not physically have a center in Izhevsk) and competitors from other regions (grid sites).  There is also information traffic (people who treat themselves) and low-income people who are forced to use free services in the state.  institutions.  This is not our target audience, so we do not take them into account. </li><li>  Increase conversion from 55% to 70%. </li></ol><br>  Who read - thank you for your attention.
