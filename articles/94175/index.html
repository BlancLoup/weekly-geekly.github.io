      <br>
      Good afternoon abelozor <br><br>  I read your article "IT software in Antarctica on the example of one station" <br>  from April 23, 20010 <br><br>  First, a little about yourself.  Since 1994 Dorozhko Sergey Nikolaevich has been the head of the ASPD service at the AARI (communications center).  Wintered in Antarctica in the position of chief specialist in electronics (the last wintering of the 36th SAE at the now closed Molodezhnaya station).  The duties of the ASPD service (communications center) include the organization and provision of round-the-clock operational communications with Russian Antarctic stations, scientific expedition ships and the North Pole drifting stations. <br><br>  Sorry, but what you wrote in your article is complete nonsense. <br><br>  For a start, a little historical background.  Until the beginning of the 90s, the connection with the then not Russian, and the Soviet Antarctic stations was carried out via radio channels in the HF band.  The main radio station was Molodezhnaya.  For this purpose, such transmitters as Lightning, PKM-20, Cyclone, PKM-5 were used.  All information was transmitted to the communications center located near Moscow.  Even then, realizing that it was necessary to develop new communication systems at the Soviet Antarctic stations, they were installing the Volna satellite communications station, which operated via the INMARSAT and Horizon satellites.  Since 1993, all communication with the Russian Antarctic stations is carried out through the satellites of the international satellite communications system INMARSAT.  Each station has several models of satellite terminals (INMARSAT-C, INMARSAT-B, FLEET-77, BGAN, INMARSAT-M, etc.). <br><br>  Now on the merits of your article. <br><br>  1. You and all users are very upset by the cost of access to the INTERNET.  Yes, indeed, the cost of access to the INTERNET at the Russian Antarctic stations is high, to be completely accurate, it amounts to 4.25 USD per 1 Mbit ‚Äî that is, 36 USD per 1 MB.  But this cost was not established by the Guidelines of the Russian Antarctic Expedition, but by the international satellite communication system INMARSAT, which operates through its 4 geostationary satellites and through foreign coast stations (there are no such stations in Russia).  This tariff is the same for all countries and for the USA, and for Russia, and for China.  If he annoys you, you can contact the headquarters of INMARSAT, it is in London (I can give you the address). <br>  2. Is there censorship of private correspondence of polar explorers?  Immediately I will answer, no, although I personally for her with both hands.  I have been 16 years at the position of head of a communications center and in my memory only once it was decided not to send a private letter to the address indicated.  The reason for this was that 50% of the text of the letter contained not the normative vocabulary, but the remaining 50% of the threat to the addressee.  Let me give you another example of why I censor.  About 3-4 years ago on one of the vessels, which stood on the maintenance of our communication center, there was a slight technical failure.  One of the crew members via satellite communications system reported this to the media.  Not being a specialist and completely unaware of the technique, he blew an elephant out of a fly.  As a result, for three days, instead of engaging in providing the vessel with operational communications, the employees of the communications center answered the telephone calls of anxious relatives, some of whom were reanimated from the experience, while the ship repaired and continued the voyage.  You forget that the communication system with the Russian Antarctic stations is departmental and the rules for using this system have the right to establish who owns it (that is, the management of the AARI GU).  And then, in your opinion, it should be so, one creates a communication system, supports its efficiency, and the rules for the use of the system are set by someone else. <br>  3. I do not understand why you are so worried about the fact that employees of the operational watch have the opportunity to find out the contents of private correspondence.  You are not indignant when you come to the post office and send a telegram, the employee of the communication gets acquainted with its text during the transfer.  Exactly the same employees are the employees of the communication center of the AARI.  All of them observe the rule of privacy of private correspondence and, in case of its violation, bear the appropriate punishment.  About 9-10 years ago, I had to fire an operational watch employee only for the fact that he had informed the party not even the contents of the letter, but only the recipient's postal address.  And to be honest, my employees are already sick of these letters (imagine so many years, willingly or not willingly, to read such nonsense).  The feeling is that a person goes not to spend the winter, but to write letters.  Some polar explorers write sheets of 100 each month. In the 36th SAE I received only 2 letters for 21 months of wintering, which was enough for me. <br><br>  And the last.  In my deep conviction, the trouble of Russia is not in the cold and bad roads, but in incompetent people.  Everyone should do his own job for an ecologist in Antarctica to deal with the environment (to put it simply, clean the territory of the station from debris, and a communications specialist - with communication). <br><br>  PS Due to the heavy workload (May 21, 2010, 10-05 Moscow time to St. Petersburg, the R / V ‚ÄúAkademik Fedorov‚Äù returned from the next Antarctic voyage, and the nuclear-powered icebreaker ‚ÄúRussia‚Äù went to the drifting station SP) I no longer intend to write to you.  I also ask you to cancel my request for assistance in registration. <br><br>  05/21/2010 <br><br>  Head of ASPD (communication center) <br>  State Institutions Arctic <br>  and antarctic research <br>  Institute Dorozhko S.N. <br><br>  <b>UPD (sent in the following letter):</b> <br>  I forgot to answer one more question, why letters of polar explorers sometimes do not reach their addressees.  In due time, a 3-month monitoring was carried out specifically at the direction of the leadership of the Russian Antarctic Expedition to ascertain the reasons.  If interested, I can tell you its results. <br><br>  The first reason and the most important.  The letter is sent to the so-called free mailbox, opened on yandex, rambler or mail.  People either cannot understand that only cheese in a mousetrap can be free.  The worst thing is that you can track the sending by the AARI mail server of a message, and it is impossible to receive data on the reception of this message from the administrators of the above mail servers.  Since the box is free no one will give you any information.  (about 80% of cases). <br>  The second reason.  On the recipient's mail server, spam protection is configured incorrectly, and according to this letter from Antarctica is considered spam (10% of cases) <br>  The third reason.  Email address is incorrect.  Sometimes it is bent, which is not that without a glass, and even with a liter you will not understand.  (about 7-9%) of cases. <br>  And the most exotic case.  The recipient received the letter, but refuses to admit it, and only when you press it against the wall, confirms the reception (guess three times why, who did not work in operational communication with the Russian Antarctic stations and maritime vessels, they would not guess).  (3-5%). <br><br>  --------------------------------- End of original text -------------- ----------------------- <br><br>  I, for my part, will not join the discussion with Sergey Nikolayevich in this topic, but if I have any questions from users, I‚Äôll be happy to answer in the comments. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/94175/">https://habr.com/ru/post/94175/</a></p>
