  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Professional video analytics came to Russian retail</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><h3>  First serious introduction </h3><br>  Increasingly, Russian integrators are receiving requests from their customers for the installation of video analytics systems in retail.  The first major trading network that held the competition and long-term tests for the supply of such a solution was M-Video.  The main task in most stores now is counting visitors.  However, the largest chain of stores paid special attention to such aspects as accuracy of counting, the possibility of counting not only at the entrance, but also in an unstructured line of sedentary people, personnel classification by clothing, determination of staff activity, analysis of the behavior of visitors in the store. Due to the large number of stores , as well as a set of inputs in each of them, it was important to obtain generalized data on the number entered from all inputs, to compare data obtained at certain intervals in different stores. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h3>  Counting Visitors </h3><br>  Consider the possibilities and advantages of video analytics for retail chains.  First, it is <a href="http://synesis.ru/solutions/cassiopeia/podschet-posetitelej-v-torgovyix-setyax-i-bankax">counting buyers</a> .  This function is performed by many counters without using video.  If you compare the accuracy, then the video analytics from a professional developer gives an accuracy of 95+ percent, which is more than enough for the customer.  The accuracy of the meters varies from 70 to 95 percent depending on the technology, working conditions and cost of the device. The main problems of the counters of limited functionality: low accuracy, inconvenience in processing data obtained in large retail chains. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1c9/7a6/99a/1c97a699ac8b5d9e2de4e47c61ddcc6d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h3>  Analysis of people in line </h3><br>  The next important video analytics functionality is <a href="http://synesis.ru/solutions/cassiopeia/podschet-lyudej-v-ocheredi">queue ratings</a> .  Using this tool, you can estimate the number of people in the queue, the time they spend in it, get the average value per day, week, build graphs and charts describing customers.  Why does this manager?  Having such data, the head optimizes the work schedule of the staff to reduce queues, gets the cashier's efficiency ratio (KPI).  Some companies offer <a href="http://synesis.ru/technology/push-uvedomleniya-na-mobilnyij">mobile notifications</a> (applications on iOs, Android, sms) about the formation of a queue for an instant reaction of a senior cashier or store director.  Using this tool, you can assess the quality of the design of the shop window or dummies in just one or two days (KPI of the marketing department and merchandisers).  If the results do not suit the manager, then you can instantly change the display of goods and analyze the changes, based on the qualitative assessment obtained using video analytics.  Now you don‚Äôt have to wait for a few weeks when the statistics on the store‚Äôs checks are accumulated.  You save time, and properly decorated display cases and the correct layout of the new collection allows you to earn more money.

You get a card where you can see where customers stay in your store and where they spend the most time.  You can work with this card in a variety of ways.  For example: identify the most expensive display cases, place advertising information in hot places, more expensive products, draw attention to unpopular areas. In addition to the heat map, the administrator can also use so-called.  <a href="http://synesis.ru/solutions/cassiopeia/analiz-povedeniya-posetitelej">trajectory map</a> .  With the help of the trajectory map, you can see the most popular travel routes for customers, identify unpopular areas of the store, take the necessary measures to attract people to the ‚Äúcold‚Äù zones and evaluate how the behavior of customers has changed. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/808/a33/6c0/808a336c0b0fda4c555695cf5ca96e37.png" alt="image"><br><br><h3>  Analysis of solutions in the Russian market </h3><br>  Consider some of the solutions that are currently on the market.  First of all, this is the leading video analytics developer Synesis.  Specialized complex <a href="http://synesis.ru/solutions/cassiopeia">"Cassiopaea"</a> designed to meet the needs of retail.  The user gets a kind of Google Analytics for offline stores with rich functionality.  High-level analytics is combined with a well-developed user interface, which allows you to get the maximum of useful information for analysis and decision making.  Foreign video analytics is presented on the Russian market by Verint, it is offered by several integrators.  Verint produces high-level analytics and has a successful track record of implementation in the European market.  However, among the shortcomings can be noted the high cost of the solution, the lack of personalization and support in the Russian market. <br>  Elvis NeoTech also offers its solution.  Its main feature - video analytics does not use a computer or server and is produced in a computational box.  Of the benefits can be noted simple installation, low cost, they promise an accurate calculation.  Among the shortcomings - limited functionality (only counting), the ability to place only one signal line under one camera, time-consuming software update and video analytics algorithms, the inability to centrally collect statistics.  Some companies are working in this direction, but have not yet developed a complete solution.  For example, the Russian innovation company Satellite Innovation demonstrates the capabilities of its analytics. <br><br><h3>  Analysis of solutions in the Russian market </h3><br>  <strong>Complex video analytics "Cassiopeia"</strong> <br>  <strong>Manufacturer:</strong> Russia, <a href="http://synesis.ru/">Synesis</a> <br><ul><li>  <strong>Pros:</strong> A wide range of modules (more than 5 different modules and more than 10 types of reports).  Multi-server solution, works on slow communication channels. </li><li>  <strong>Cons:</strong> Lack of built-in video recording.  But this disadvantage can be eliminated with the help of third-party free products, such as iVideon. </li></ul><br>  <strong>Nextiva Video Analytics</strong> <br>  <strong>Manufacturer:</strong> USA, Verint <br><ul><li>  <strong>Pros:</strong> Adult, proven solution.  Developed reporting tools. </li><li>  <strong>Cons:</strong> No web interface, you need to install special software.  A high-speed communication channel to the point of sale is required to receive a report  High price. </li></ul><br>  <strong>Statistics</strong> <br>  <strong>Manufacturer:</strong> Russia, Elvis-NeoTek <br><ul><li>  <strong>Pros:</strong> The easiest solution.  Using inexpensive cameras. </li><li>  <strong>Cons:</strong> Lack of centralized data collection and aggregation.  It supports only counting by one signal line without the possibility of counting people in the queue. </li></ul><br>  <strong>Macroscop and AxxonNext</strong> <br>  <strong>Manufacturer:</strong> Russia, Satellite Innovation and ITV <br><ul><li>  <strong>Pros:</strong> Multinational video surveillance system. </li><li>  <strong>Cons:</strong> Only counting people.  This solution was originally designed for security, not business intelligence.  There is no web interface with statistics and centralized data collection. </li></ul><br><br><h3>  Scope of video analytics for business </h3><br>  Video analytics capabilities find their application not only in retail, but also in banks or, for example, in <a href="http://synesis.ru/industry/transportnaya-infrastuktura">transport</a> .  In the metro of the two largest cities of Russia, tests are being actively conducted among video analytics on security and video analytics for business, where, as part of the final large-scale and <br>  The multifunctional solution also participates in the Cassiopeia complex. <br><br>  <b>The objectives of the complex:</b> counting passengers, queue assessment, analysis of passenger traffic. <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/Upz78pl7-6Y%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,1500004,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhi8ttehIEhEr6vyGlujim5CmkIduA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h3>  User friendliness and information security </h3><br>  It is very important not only the accuracy of video analytics, but also the convenience of the solution.  The user should be comfortable receiving and analyzing data.  No need to overwork the operator with unnecessary repetitive actions.  It should be possible to view both standard reports and personal reports that are needed for this particular user.  The ability to collect data according to different rules from one or several cameras.  Also convenient access from any point to reports collected from all objects, for example, via a web interface, the ability to transfer data over an encrypted channel for the user's security is important.  It greatly simplifies the work of the user to summarize and compare various graphs directly in the report without first unloading the data.  This allows you to create complex graphics for non-standard situations.  For example, to get the entry rate (ER - Entry Rate), conversion rate (CR - Conversion Rate), efficiency ratio for the seller, cashier, storefront, outdoor advertising, (KPI - Key Performance Indicator) and others. <br><br><h3>  Analysis using video analytics in practice </h3><br>  Consider the use of video analytics on the example of a clothing store.  With all the necessary tools, managers will be able to identify the weak points of their store.  We start the "diagnosis" using video analytics.  First of all, you can estimate the number of customers who enter the store and compare it with the number of people passing by (entry rate (ER - Entry Rate). If the percentage of people entering is small, then you can work on the showcase and see how this data changes. If everything is fine with the number of visitors, we look further. We evaluate how the customers move in the store. Do our expectations coincide with the real behavior of people. For example, we estimate how much time customers spend in a particular department before a new collection or  Edited by the sales department. If you are not satisfied with the results, then you can change the display, the ‚Äúimages", additionally attract visitors in various ways. If everything is good at this stage, then we look further. Then there is the fitting room. who goes to the checkout.If the difference is very large, it means that the buyer is not satisfied with the quality, style of clothing and something needs to be done with this. Be sure to follow the lack of queues.  This is the strongest irritant for the buyer.  The queue should not exceed 4-5 people, and the collected statistics will help to properly distribute the staff between the cash registers and the hall, depending on the time of day and day of the week. <br><br><h3>  The future is video analytics </h3><br>  Among the ten strategic technologies identified by <a href="http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/2209615">Gartner</a> for 2013, with objectives <br>  Video analytics for bizenes strongly correlate at least three: Strategic Big Data, Actionable Analytics, and Mobile Apps.  Similar forecasts are made by <a href="http://www.imsresearch.com/press-release/Video_Surveillance_Trends_for_2013">IMS Research:</a> Metadata as Big Data (Video Meta-data as ‚ÄúBig Data‚Äù) and Video Surveillance (Video Surveillance Goes Vertical). <br>  Thus, the further development of the business infrastructure will necessarily include video analytics using all the possibilities.  Private tasks are statistics collection, data visualization for reports, online video viewing, queue prediction, use of a cloud service, mobile notifications. <br>  According to <a href="http://www.abiresearch.com/press/business-intelligence-tools-incorporating-video-an">ABI Research,</a> in 2013, the video analytics market will continue to grow rapidly, and by 2016 it will reach $ 900 million. <br>  As we see, video analytics for business are actively beginning to be interested in Russia.  Large growth is expected in the Russian market for several reasons.  Interest not only from major retail participants (M-Video, Detsky Mir, Svyaznoy, MTS, RivGosh and others) but also from banks (Sberbank, Otkritie Bank) and small chain stores that are striving to improve service and increase sales.  Large projects are launched with state financing on transport (Metro, Russian Railways, Airports) and in public institutions.  Even large enterprises and factories seek to monitor the work of the conveyor and jobs with the help of video analytics. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/175357/">https://habr.com/ru/post/175357/</a></p>
