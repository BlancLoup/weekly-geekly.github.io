So far, we will have to limit ourselves to what was announced at the conference itself, as well as published on English-language sites.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/84e/8de/fca/84e8defcae1144868e565e9bf6fe7dd5.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The introduction of Business suggests that now it will be possible to correspond via Messenger on behalf of the pages - as long as it is possible only in the browser.  The functionality of the chat will be expanded and it will be possible to send special stickers with prices to the client, a map indicating where the goods are now and when they will be delivered to the final destination. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/296/ccf/954/296ccf9540554b27831244761394cf28.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Thanks to authorization through an account on Facebook, it will be possible to keep in touch with the client not only during the purchase, but also after he left the site - all correspondence will be stored in the account messages.  The company believes that so Business will help get rid of the numerous SMS and email alerts that now accompany each stage of the purchase. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/eb7/245/654/eb72456544154c57829fab76d8c7f80f.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>As a result, Messenger Business will allow to solve a number of tasks at once:</b> <br><br>  <b>Customer retention.</b>  Logging in to the online store through a Facebook account, the client enters itself in the database.  Even if he did not buy anything, but he was looking for something or ordered something that was not at that time, it will remain in history and can be used in the future.  For example, for push-notifications that a particular product appeared in stock: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/455/856/13e/45585613e9dd475c9bc1a36966865a24.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Accompanying the client.</b>  Instead of letters and SMS, all questions can be discussed in one window, accompanying all this with additional information in the form of special stickers.  There you can also change the order or even cancel. <br><br>  <b>Communication with the client.</b>  Neither Everlane nor Zulily has any feedback services.  Until recently, all communication took place through letters.  Messenger will be a replacement for online chat rooms, and thanks to the integration of the application with ZenDesk, technical support will also be possible: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7b5/9ab/04e/7b59ab04e37f4100a647577c976c7642.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Personification of customers.</b>  In the same way as <a href="http://zopim.com/">Zopim</a> (we will talk about it later), Messenger will help identify customers that all other means of communication do not allow (we in Rocket are also working on it now). <br><br>  With the introduction of Business, the application from the chat will turn into a tool covering all trends in communication with the visitor.  Messenger now works only with Everline and Zulily, but you can <a href="https://www.messenger.com/business">fill out the form</a> and get the opportunity to try Business one of the first. <br><br>  The company is not yet reporting how the new function will be monetized, but they have already admitted that if Business is successful, then it may become partially or fully paid. <br><br>  Ps According to Facebook itself, 11,000,000 users from Russia are registered in the social network. <br><br><blockquote>  Messenger appeared after Facebook decided to put the messaging function in a separate application.  It was in March 2014.  Then Zuckerberg said that the company intends to focus on creating its own applications and Messenger joined the ranks of Paper (news aggregator), Pages (page administration), and, strictly speaking, Facebook itself. <br><br>  Until mid-summer of 2014, it was possible to exchange messages without Messenger, but at the end of July, the company released another update to Facebook, where this feature was no longer there.  At the same time, the first innovation of Messenger was presented - search by phone number even for people who are not registered on Facebook, but installed the application. <br><br>  Since then, new features have appeared in Messenger every 1-2 months - stickers, calls, the ability to send videos, audio recordings, the ability to put inscriptions on images, edit them, filters, group chats and much more.  Prior to the conference, F8 Messenger remained another messaging application, a competitor to WhatsApp, WeChat, Viber, Telegram, and others. <br></blockquote><br><br>  Pps In this blog we will try to describe all the most interesting and useful in the field of communication with the visitor on the site, customer retention, feedback forms and increasing conversion. <br><br>  Thank you for reading us! <br>  Subscribe to our <a href="http://megamozg.ru/company/rocketcallback/">blog</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/289698/">https://habr.com/ru/post/289698/</a></p>
