Here are some facts.

    <ul><li>  The number of clicks when using video is increased by 200-300%; </li><li>  Using video, you can increase the conversion on the landing page by 80%; </li><li>  The average user spends 16 minutes a month watching online video ads; </li><li>  One minute of the video equals the effectiveness of the impact on the target audience to 1,800,000 words. </li></ul><br><br>  And this is only a small part of what video can be useful for. <br><br>  In today's issue, we want to tell you about <b>popular social platforms that will allow you to build a successful marketing strategy through a video content channel.</b> <br><br>  <b>Facebook and Twitter - ‚Äútrendsetters‚Äù</b> <br><br>  Not so long ago, these platforms were adapted for the promotion of video content.  Improvements for marketers include an increase in the possible resolution of downloaded video materials, and their sizes.  By uploading video content to the pages of these platforms, you automatically increase the organic reach of users, since it is usually much higher than regular text and graphic materials.  By adding your content to these resources, you will gradually be able to build an extensive multimedia library and take your brand beyond the official website. <br><br>  <b>Live broadcasts on Facebook, Periscope, Meerkat</b> <br><br>  Do not want to spend valuable time creating content?  Do a live broadcast in a few minutes.  Share the latest news of the company, make a ‚Äústuffing‚Äù of information about the products planned for launch, create a question-answer session.  The best strategy is to show the ‚Äúhuman‚Äù side of video marketing, life inside the company.  After all, a well-known fact from the theory of communication is that people prefer to deal with people, and not with impersonal logos. <br><br>  You can appoint one company representative who will regularly appear in front of the camera for your social platforms.  So many famous brands do.  Try the technique in action.  Choose a topic that is close to your business, and shoot issues with tips that will be useful and interesting to your potential consumers.  <b>The main indicator of successful content is its use for the audience.</b>  Therefore, the more important information you pass on to your viewers, the more views you can get.  And this is a direct path to the popularity of the channel in particular and the brand as a whole. <br><br>  <b>Instagram and Snapchat</b> <br><br>  Not so long ago Instagram raised the allowable length of the video.  On March 28, 2016, the launch of the innovation started and now it is already available to all users of the popular service.  As stated on the Instagram blog, over the past six months (data for March 2016) <b>, the time spent by users watching videos increased by more than 40%</b> , so it was decided to provide an enhanced ability to view and download videos. <br><br>  <b>For videos to be interesting and informative, they should not be too long.</b>  In today's world, people are limited in time, so do not want to spend it on viewing content. <br><br>  Video hosting <b>Wistia</b> , designed for business, one of the main competitors of YouTube, analyzed the dependence of audience involvement and the percentage of views on the length of the video.  The result was quite expected: <b>the shorter the video, the better</b> .  <b>The priority was video lasting less than one minute</b> .  This study was conducted in 2012.  For 4 years, the pace of life has become even faster, respectively, people began to value their time even more.  So the conclusion suggests itself. <br><br>  <b>YouTube video giant</b> <br><br>  The power of this platform is indisputable.  YouTube is the second largest search engine after Google.  If you want to showcase the product in action or remove the "lifecycle" - YouTube is suitable for this as well as possible.  The video will allow you to more easily and quickly convey information to the audience, and placing the material on a popular video hosting service will improve the seo-optimization of the official brand website. <br><br>  The largest platform in RuNet for entrepreneurs of a new generation, VC.RU, in January published a rating of 50 branded YouTube channels, compiled on the basis of the number of subscribers (data as of January 26, 2016).  For the study several hundreds of branded channels from the fields of FMCG, cinema, cars, telecom and others were examined. <br><br>  The main focus of the analysis was on the Engagement rate (engagement), which reflects the response to the video and user activity (comments, likes, reposts).  The final stage of the study was monitoring the number of views, distribution and user feedback on the video. <br><br>  Here are some successful cases on using the YouTube channel to promote the brand. <br><br>  The first place in the ranking was taken by the channel <b>‚ÄúDevchat‚Äù owned by Procter &amp; Gamble.</b> <br><br>  In the first video on the channel there is no mention of the product.  The main content is the lifestyle for the ‚Äúmaiden‚Äù audience.  Grocery videos appeared on the channel three months after launch.  Brand messages are broadcast by animated characters - girls Nyasha and Mila.  Food clips appear every few months.  In November 2014, the first music video ‚ÄúGirls‚Äù was released on the channel, in which resident girls appeared. <br><br>  In second place in Russia is the <b>‚ÄúGreat Opposition‚Äù, created to promote the seventh episode of ‚ÄúStar Wars‚Äù.</b> <br><br>  For several months, he became the leader of the Russian YouTube, gaining more than 400 thousand subscribers. <br><br>  Here we see a full-fledged YouTube series of seven episodes of 6-10 minutes each.  The idea is that two very popular video blogger in Russia - Stas Davydov from This is Good (5,264,577 subscribers) and Katya Clap (3,960,485 subscribers) - are fighting for the power on YouTube.  Jedi paraphernalia, characters, magical power - all this sends the viewer to the film and involves the younger generation in the great cosmic saga. <br><br>  5th place in Russia was taken by the <b>AX</b> channel <b>, which is known for its non-standard content and original approach to advertising.</b> <br><br>  Kirill Bardashev, senior brand manager of AX: <br><br>  ‚Äú <i>YouTube channel is a tool that can be used to solve various tasks: brand loyalty, product knowledge, sales.</i>  <i>For us, the YouTube channel is the core of the digital ecosystem, the center of any project.</i>  <i>The secret to attracting the attention of the audience is in the regular release of high-quality, interesting, and, most importantly, unique content.</i>  <i>Then users will begin to subscribe, thereby showing their loyalty, then they will look forward to the video, leave comments</i> . ‚Äù <br><br>  Well, in today's release, we looked at examples of modern social media platforms that will make your video content a true ‚Äúking‚Äù of marketing strategy.  People perceive visual, multimedia information better than boring texts and pictures.  If you want to promote your brand and daily improve its position among competitors, <u>use the maximum number of channels that have already helped to gain wide popularity for more than one brand.</u> <br><br>  <u>Carefully select the sources of the placement of video content and provide regular updates of interesting and useful information.</u>  This approach will allow you not only to acquire a pool of loyal customers, to achieve a large number of views, but also to become a leader in your industry among representatives of different age categories. <br><br> <a href="http://www.byyd.me/ru/register/%3Futm_source%3Dmegamozg%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3Dcontent_marketing"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/041/3c5/29a/0413c529a1424210a02b160e54a40e80.png"></a> <br><br>  <a href="http://www.byyd.me/ru/%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr31052016"><b>BYYD ‚Ä¢ Mobile Advertising Platform</b></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/302322/">https://habr.com/ru/post/302322/</a></p>
