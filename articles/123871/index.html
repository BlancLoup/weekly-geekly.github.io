  <section class="page js-page"><h1>E-public services: they have been waiting for the promised three years. TCEF Report</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The recent Tver Economic Forum (http://www.tver-forum.ru/) has shown that we will not be able to receive all the promised public services in electronic form very soon.  The main obstacle to this is the lack of an interdepartmental electronic interaction system or SMEV.  Before the full launch of the SMEV - as before the moon on foot, too many problems have not yet been resolved.  Read more - under the cut <a name="habracut"></a><br>  Perhaps the most pleasant thing in the Tver forum was that the government representatives themselves began talking about the fact that now SMEV and e-government services have more problems than achievements.  Not for nothing that the timing of the launch of the SMEV was postponed for a year.  People from the government said that this delay is necessary, including in order to put in order the legislative acts regulating SMEV and e-public services.  Even here there are a lot of flaws. <br>  The most serious problem is still the notorious digital divide.  There are far from everywhere high-speed Internet channels - in particular, this concerns regional departments and local governments.  What to say about the presence of a secure data channel.  Alexey Popov (director of the department of information technologies and communications of the government of the Russian Federation) honestly admitted that so far none of the regions have a full connection of the state authorities to a single node - and this is a prerequisite for the launch of the EIA. <br>  Transmitted and received data somewhere must be stored - there is a need to use data centers.  Traditionally, here too we manage to create problems.  It turns out that it is impossible to build one data center for several departments - budgets are different and each department will have to be responsible for their use.  So it turns out that either there is no data center at all, or there is one, but the power is used well, very inefficiently. <br>  Electronic document management systems used by departments are a separate issue.  Every day we are confronted with this aspect of the activities of departments, so we know how many large-scale problems exist here.  On the ground in the regions there are different EDS, which practically do not integrate in any way with SMEV, i.e.  It is necessary not only to connect to the SMEV, but also to completely change the EDS, on which substantial funds have been spent.  Rostelecom offers its own system of execution of regulations (SIR), which does not fulfill the functions of the SED, but is integrated with SMEV.  This system is worth millions, and of course, not all departments will pull such a purchase.  The situation is also complicated by the fact that when changing the EDS, the staff will have to be retrained, and this has always been, is and will be difficult.  Of course, there are regions that have flatly refused to change something and are now engaged in the organization of infrastructure and integration with SMEV, bypassing Rostelecom. <br>  The interaction of departments, and divisions within one department is a separate song.  Moreover, this is not about electronic interaction, but about real, so to speak offline.  To start an e-government service, it is necessary to passport on it ‚Äî specify the paths for passing requests, the timing of information and those responsible for each stage, etc.  But everything is as usual with us: there are departments that themselves can provide, for example, only one service, and everything is ready for its launch.  So, to make efforts so that other departments related to them could launch their services, they have no desire.  As representatives of the government said, sometimes even a meeting of interacting departments is difficult to organize. <br>  Complicates the situation and the distribution of budgets.  Each department and many divisions independently finance the work on the organization of the IEWC.  On the one hand, this is good - freedom, a better understanding of what a separate unit needs, etc.  But in terms of the effectiveness of the use of funds, these are unnecessary expenses: even children know that wholesale is cheaper. <br>  Until now, the issue with the use of electronic documents as legally relevant has not been closed.  What is most interesting, in this direction the state often appears ahead of business.  For example, Rosreestr already provides a part of documents when registering real estate transactions in electronic form, and banks not only refuse to accept them, but do not negotiate on this issue.  The only bank that decided to ‚Äúnegotiate‚Äù was Promsvyazbank. <br>  There are also problems with the use of EDS.  The head of the Federal Tax Service Andrei Petrushin said at the TSEF that there are only 5 notaries in Moscow who know how to use EDS - what then is being done in remote areas ... But then each region is looking for its own way out.  In Volgograd, for example, they intend to issue an EDS to every woman who has given birth to a child - right in the maternity hospital, so that immediately after returning home, a woman has the opportunity to issue ‚Äúchildish‚Äù benefits without leaving home. <br>  Now some statistics.  The leader in terms of ICT use in government bodies is Moscow: here the ICT use index is 0.63.  In St. Petersburg, slightly lower - 0.621.  In third place is Chuvashia - 0.588.  The outsider is Ingushetia - 0.162.  The data were calculated and presented at the TSEF Institute of the Information Society.  The advantages of the situation include, although not significant, but still reducing the gap between the leading regions and the laggards: 4,246 in 2007 against 3,887 in 2009.  In 2010, the gap should be slightly reduced. <br>  There are some statistics on public services portals.  The index of completeness of filling the federal portal is 32.7%.  For regional portals, this figure ranges from 15% to 76%.  Technical compliance with the requirements for the federal portal is estimated at 53.2%, and for the regional - from 9 to 72%.  The availability of services on the federal portal is 41.1%, and on regional ones it is in the range from 11 to 74%.  So both the federal portal and the regional ones have something to strive for. </div>
