      The visitor scans the page, unconsciously trying to ‚Äúgrasp‚Äù the bright elements, because experience tells him that the most important information is located inside such elements: conditions, discounts, contacts, descriptions, etc. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  At this very moment, the following happens: the principles of the brain play a cruel joke with the owners of those sites that rely too much on Direct and textual descriptions.  All content on the site should be of high quality, convincing.  It is not enough just to attract a visitor to the site - you need to convert this visit into an application.  The mistake is that not enough time is devoted to the content on the site, but it is spending too much time (and money) on Direct.  After all, directors promise attendance - they give attendance.  A very small percentage of them go beyond that. <br><br>  But this is not enough: the client still needs to be convinced.  In order to convince the client, you need to give him at least a chance to learn about your offer.  Yes, everything is very simple: give a person a chance to become your client.  Pay attention to your content and take urgent measures so that every visitor can clearly understand how good you are and how great you can satisfy his needs. <br><br><h6>  There are three main ways to do this: </h6><br><ul><li>  Pictures (product description using infographics) </li><li>  Text descriptions </li><li>  Product Presentation Video </li></ul><br><br>  To state all your terms and descriptions of products, you will need too much text or pictures - no one will scroll through your site, gradually studying the product. <br>  It is uninteresting, long, miserable. <br><br>  As you understand, right now I am demonstrating the advantage of using video as a method for describing a product.  Unlike text and pictures, video can be only one for each product, and the duration is about 1 minute.  Due to the fact that animated presentations, as a rule, are inspected to the end - your chances of conveying to the potential client all the information necessary for making a decision are greatly increased. <br><br>  Just imagine two sites, where on one site in the very first screen is a video describing the product within just one minute, and on the second - several screens of text descriptions. <br>  It is quite obvious who has the advantage in the race for customer contacts.  Of course, I don‚Äôt want to say that text descriptions do not work, just almost no one reads them, that's all.  That is, if all visitors read the entire text - it would work, but in reality this does not happen, because the text is not read. <br><br>  For a future client to be hooked, for example, on a picture - it is necessary that she be alone.  Well, as a last resort, so that there are very few of them, and one of them stood out among the elements of the site to a greater extent than the others - otherwise it will just be a stock with images that no one will view.  The text is important, but it needs to be combined with something more dynamic: pictures and video. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/06d/0d6/3b0/06d0d63b0a984ca9b5a12f92eff9ed8c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h5>  Link number 2: communication with the manager </h5><br>  Take as neutral an example as possible: the owner, who drew a visitor to the site using Yandex.Direct, then persuaded him to submit a purchase request using an excellent animated video describing the benefits of the product. <br><br>  When the visit was converted into an application - it must be turned into a sale! <br><br>  Take this to a sales manager.  If you do not have it - minimize the advertising campaign until you find a good manager.  Well, or if they themselves will not.  This is harder than it may seem, so do not try to do it yourself at home.  If no one plans to hire a sales manager - ask a specialist to listen to your conversations and point out errors.  And even if you are now communicating with customers - try to check yourself.  A little criticism has not prevented anyone. <br><br><h5>  The standard process of a sales person‚Äôs communication with a client looks like this: </h5><br>  1. Greetings <br>  2. Establishing contact with the client <br>  3. Identify needs <br>  4. Product Presentation <br>  5. The processing of objections <br>  5.1 Carefully listen to the client to the end, without interrupting him. <br>  5.2 Slightly pausing <br>  5.3 Emotional affiliation (partial agreement with the possibility of retreat) <br>  5.4 Clarifying Questions <br>  5.5 Exercise Objections <br>  5.6 It is necessary to make sure that there are no objections.  If they remain, you need to repeat paragraphs 5.4, 5.5 and 5.6. <br>  6. Closing a deal <br>  ‚ÄúStandard‚Äù does not mean bad / wrong.  These stages are universal, because they are suitable for both ‚Äúhot‚Äù and ‚Äúcold‚Äù sales. <br><br>  It is obvious that in many respects the success of using Yandex.Direct depends not only on the director, but also on the content, as well as on the sales manager.  Forgetting about quality content and / or sales manager, you either lose the requests from the site, or all applications will merge. <br><br>  For some, this has long been an ‚Äúobvious truth,‚Äù but I do not think that there can be a lot of ‚Äúobvious‚Äù.  The more people will know about this, the less resources will ‚Äúmerge‚Äù into that very ‚Äúnowhere‚Äù. <br><br>  Conclusion: if you create a landing page and / or launch an advertising campaign in Yandex.Direct, think about the fact that it is the high-quality content and descriptions on the site that force the visitor to leave a request.  Do not forget also about the competent sales manager who can increase the conversion of the application for sale.  By generating bids for quality, not quantity, you will save a ton of money. <br><br>  Direct itself is just attendance.  What you can do with it is a good question.  Do not step on trampled rakes. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/294658/">https://habr.com/ru/post/294658/</a></p>
