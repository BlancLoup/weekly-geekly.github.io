And only for the parents really hot times come with an admixture of neurosis.  In the usual way of life one or more free from study hurricanes, typhoons, tsunamis break loose - in general, their own children.  They need to be occupied, entertained, to devote vacations to them, and preferably with a benefit for business - after three months of recess it is embarrassing to return to school or kindergarten the savage who has lost all communication and learning skills.  This, as in the famous joke, is long, expensive and difficult.  We have prepared a small selection that will help fulfill children's dreams and make life easier for parents. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f94/06d/063/f9406d063444660a6dd85a2d12f291ae.jpg"></div><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  From four to six ... wheels </h2><br>  Remember the cars with remote control from our childhood?  That's right, they were not there - the maximum of happiness was the cars on the wire control with a joystick that can "back" and "forward."  And meanwhile, exactly cars remain one of the most desired gifts and boys and girls, because the movement, speed, and management delight can not but grab.  Fortunately, a lot of them have become unmeasured - from inertial crumbs to impressive autonomous tracks.  And most importantly, such toys carry away not only children, but also their ever-busy dads. <br><br>  Radio <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/rc-cars/pp_594767.html%3Flkid%3D10721409">-</a> controlled <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/rc-cars/pp_594767.html%3Flkid%3D10721409">car WLtoys</a> with a powerful engine can not only drive through the city streets and off-road, gathering around itself the interested eyes of curious passersby, but also climb a small roller coaster.  An independent spring suspension and high-quality durable tires on six wheels are responsible for its outstanding climbing abilities.  The car can move on the sand - on the beach it will be the number one toy.  The machine weighs only 780 grams and develops a maximum speed of 10 km / h - not enough for this class, but where have you seen a racing SUV?  Time in motion - 12 minutes, charging - 3 hours, control distance - 80 meters. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7c2/6f9/b5d/7c26f9b5deca10c6860331e13989f5c8.jpg"></div><br>  <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/rc-cars/pp_554415.html%3Flkid%3D10721409">The HUINA dump truck</a> on the radio control plunges the child into the situation of a construction pit, especially if it is paired with an excavator loader.  The toy is quite autonomous and is designed for 20-25 minutes of continuous work, and it charges in 2 hours.  The dump truck is equipped with bright headlights and can turn in a fairly compact manner.  For $ 33.07 this is a very worthy children's gift, besides a very summer one: you can carry sand, pebbles, etc. on it.  And you can show imagination and deliver berries or sweets in the back. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9fc/154/078/9fc15407867538cdcfcd7d3144da61a7.jpg"></div><br>  Of the more expensive options and with more impressive performance <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/rc-cars/pp_605476.html%3Flkid%3D10721409">characteristics,</a> there is an aggressive <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/rc-cars/pp_605476.html%3Flkid%3D10721409">Menmax Racing BLITZ 1: 8 truck</a> .  It reaches a speed of 80 km / h - an impressive figure for machines of this type.  Imagine that this crumb is moving at the speed of a despised speedy arrogant urban hooligan on a real car.  Continuous operation time - 25 minutes.  The car is durable, waterproof, aluminum thickness on the body - 4 mm.  Softness and off-road capabilities provide durable tires and long-lasting shock absorbers. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/58f/6f1/fa8/58f6f1fa8925bf1288a268a944e1f3aa.jpg"></div><br><h2>  Passion flight </h2><br>  Summer is an ideal time for taking photos, video clips and filling family archives with bright frames, which are nice to review and show to your friends - however, already on the monitor or by sharing links.

      What a summer without a quadcopter, especially if it's the <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/rc-quadcopters/pp_587635.html%3Flkid%3D10721409">DJI Phantom 4 Pro itself</a> with a 6-axis gyroscope and shooting in 4K format at 60 frames per second.  This toy is not for children, but it can give a lot of impressions to anyone.  Although the price and $ 1513.27, the quality and pleasure of owning it pays off.  Phantom is able to take photographs in series mode at a speed of 14 photos per second, so you do not miss a single moment.  Thanks to infrared sensors and optical sensors, the drone has become virtually invulnerable - it detects obstacles in 5 directions and avoids collision.  Flight time - 30 minutes, distance for remote control - 7 km.  This is a serious drone, with which you can shoot summer landscapes, urban environment, favorite festivals, corporate parties and everything your heart desires. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b1b/f9b/6c1/b1bf9b6c18fe59ca6c8c517e29aa5cef.jpg"></div><br>  But the Quadcopter market is not alive as a Phantom.  For example, the <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/rc-quadcopters/pp_313051.html%3Flkid%3D10721409">Walkera F210</a> drone looks and works very impressive.  The aggressive, almost militaristic body is made of carbon fiber and includes a protective structure for the engine cover, which gives the structure additional impact resistance.  On board the drone is a powerful engine and HD night vision camera.  The flight time is 12 minutes, charging time is 1.5 hours, you can go through several cycles per day. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5c3/bda/629/5c3bda6293664058f0946b4c2d9f7013.jpg"></div><br><h2>  For those who know a lot about wheels </h2><br>  Summer is the best time for walking, many citizens start walking to work, and on weekends they discover the beautiful and interesting places of their native cities and travel again and again.  But time always turns out to be little, and I want to get around as much as possible or take a ride along your favorite embankment with a breeze.  One of the options is to buy a bicycle, but with it it is difficult to go into transport, to shop, to a cafe, to go to another city by train or plane.  And you can look in the direction of the <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/skateboard/pp_621082.html%3Flkid%3D10721409">electric scooter (scooter)</a> for $ 224.99.  Folding scooter is made of durable aluminum alloy and weighs only 7.58 kg - even a relatively fragile girl will be able to lift it and move it a short distance.  The scooter, among other things, is equipped with a monitor that displays the main indicators and battery level.  The electric car is ready to drive up to 15 km with a maximum speed of 23 km / h.  To put it mildly, it is very breeze.  The scooter looks beautiful and stylish, even a man in a business suit will not look ridiculous on him.  Its only drawback is the restriction of the owner‚Äôs weight to 120 kg, but even to a hundred and a bit it‚Äôs not so easy to accelerate. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/710/6fa/e95/7106fae959d0b8252cba64a9078f9336.png"></div><br>  We do not guarantee, but most likely, your urban child will certainly begin to ask the trendy "hovebord" - two-wheeled transport of the future.  He has already earned incredible popularity due to the ease of development and comfortable, intuitive control.  Of course, he has little to do with sports and is not as effective as a skateboard, but he is at times safer.  Among the many similar vehicles, pay attention to the <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/scooters-and-wheels/pp_423511.html%3Flkid%3D10721409">Hiwheel Q3 Hoverboard</a> , designed for 15-20 km walk.  In addition, it is a convenient and sustainable option with backlight, it is also easy.  Segway weighs only 10 kg and after a walk it is handy to bring even a teenager home.  By the way, you will greatly facilitate the process of carrying by buying a special bag. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/489/0f5/f1b/4890f5f1b1602d9da310c6d6078cf209.jpg"></div><br><h2>  For introverts, couch potatoes and inventors </h2><br>  There are such children (and adults too!) For whom the best rest is to sit at home with a book, leisurely soldering something homemade or just playing at the computer.  And it's not a bad upbringing, as many bloggers and teachers shout, it's about the goals of the child and his temperament.  If he doesn‚Äôt just sit at home with his pants, staring stupidly at the next hi-hai, but finds useful and developmental activities, why not?  Then these guys become leaders in college teams for ‚ÄúWhat?  Where?  When? ‚ÄùAnd occupy the first places in the competitions in aircraft modeling and robotics.  It is only important to be able to direct interest in the right direction. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/3d-printers-3d-printer-kits/pp_426827.html%3Flkid%3D10721409">The Sunlu SL 3D pen</a> printer is an entry-level printer with which you can design, make plastic figures and souvenirs, and at the same time learn the basics of modeling.  $ 34.99 is a good price to understand if your child is interested in this kind of work and whether it is worth moving to adult models.  A little advice - stock up on PLA multi-colored consumables, the most annoying when they end in the middle of very important crafts.  And how much children have things and events marked ‚Äúvery important,‚Äù we all know. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7df/806/07d/7df80607da5c7864280f614e4e8ea02f.jpg"></div><br>  If you have already found out that your child likes modeling and making quality gizmos, you can pay attention to the <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/3d-printers-3d-printer-kits/pp_428455.html%3Flkid%3D10721409">Anet A6 3D Desktop Printer Kit</a> .  This printer, besides the exceptionally positive experience of DIY-workers around the world, has an important advantage - you need to collect it before starting work.  Not every adult copes with it the first time, and for a child the assembly of such equipment is a real engineering experience.  On it you can make serious, beautiful and smooth products and models. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8d1/822/8b1/8d18228b1771bdde56e969a085728d57.jpg"></div><br>  It is 2017 in the yard, and, judging from the numerous circles and schools of robotics, children are taught to program and design from the earliest years.  And if so, why would an avid DIY amateur dad not do something interesting with the child using the <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/development-boards/pp_211518.html%3Flkid%3D10721409">Arduino newbie set</a> and some nice base, such as <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/kits/pp_265459.html%3Flkid%3D10721409">a crawler droid</a> ?  In total, it will be $ 42.40 + $ 27.40 = $ 69.80, that is, about 4,000 rubles, and this is much cheaper and more useful than the famous branded designers.  The child develops the skill of designing, modeling, information analysis, programming.  Even if the child chooses another path in the future, this practice will form logical thinking in the child, which will allow him to systematically perceive the information received. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4b1/f89/9be/4b1f899be3bf5279f3264d09babfc9b4.jpg"></div><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/48e/bef/6c9/48ebef6c90baee9e3b90f3af38046494.jpg"></div><br><h2>  Travelers and adventure lovers </h2><br>  Another summer parental action is the child‚Äôs camp camp: things are forgotten, the bag breaks, it is prohibitively heavy ... The way out is to use a durable and roomy backpack, and always with wide and soft shoulder straps that will ease the pressure of the bundle on the shoulders.  See the <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/backpacks/pp_487902.html%3Flkid%3D10721409">CAMEL MOUNTAIN backpack</a> from lightweight, durable nylon with lots of comfortable compartments for small things that need to be on the road. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/48f/b1f/510/48fb1f510a2d4cf2c66bb8d3184c6732.jpg"></div><br>  If you are going to the sea, your teenager will take great pleasure in <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/swimming/pp_227065.html%3Flkid%3D10721409">an adult mask with a 720P HD video camera</a> .  She sits comfortably on her head and takes off the underwater world quite well.  Even.  if these are coastal pebbles, the child will be terribly proud of the action video that he made himself.  The camera can shoot up to two hours in continuous mode - this is enough for a good sea walk.  The mask is supplied without a breathing tube, do not forget to purchase it additionally if serious immersions are expected. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/de5/b4e/612/de5b4e612243dbbfcd11112e88ec1265.jpg"></div><br>  For overland entertainment at the seashore and not only the dream of all boys (and some girls!) Is useful - binoculars.  We like the <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/binoculars-and-telescopes/pp_536382.html%3Flkid%3D10721409">COMET AX10</a> - classic-shaped black binoculars with 8x magnification and a viewing angle of 7.4 degrees.  Field of view - up to 1 km.  Binoculars come with accessories and in a branded convenient bag, and its weight - 0.621 kg - allows you to take it on any journey.  With it, you can maximize the detailed view of attractions, landscapes, birds, elements of architecture and urban landscape.  It is especially cool to watch the surroundings through such binoculars from the numerous roofs and balustrades available in tourist towns. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1eb/e14/7bd/1ebe147bddd59a2ff764a749deb5960e.jpg"></div><br><h2>  Little things in life: timekillers and puzzles </h2><br>  And it also happens: summer is planned, vouchers purchased, places in the camp booked.  The only nasty little thing is to take boring hours of flights and crossings.  We have chosen a few hit stuffs that are inexpensive, do not take up space, but are able to please the eyes and hands. <br><br>  Magnetic <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/puzzle-educational/pp_236579.html%3Flkid%3D10721409">cube puzzle</a> for <b>$ 13.75 -</b> one of the popular options to take your hands and kill time.  But in the hands of children, it is also a tool for developing motor skills and fantasy, because out of 216 magnetic balls you can make figures, spheres, and several heterogeneous combinations.  The toy pleasantly lies in the hand, requires a little dexterity in handling it and just looks attractive.  By the way, you can buy a few cubes and risk "magnetize" more interesting and diverse crafts.  The only thing is that you should not give a cube to children under 7 years old, in case of swallowing a pair of balls, unpleasant consequences may occur. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f7c/939/6d0/f7c9396d0c18eeb89ba2028b1a2024d3.jpg"></div><br>  Another toy of ‚Äúdouble‚Äù purpose is a cute <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/classic-retro-toys/pp_260828.html%3Flkid%3D10721409">tin walking robot</a> with mechanical winding.  An adult IT manager will become non-binding (only <b>$ 5.12)</b> and a pleasant souvenir that will enliven the desktop and easily replace the duckling during the rubber duck debugging process, and in a young child it will arouse interest in robots and technology.  The toy looks vintage, well assembled and dyed.  The robot is compact - only 12 cm tall. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/da1/0db/46e/da10db46ecf5ea4b2de93988376dbb65.jpg"></div><br>  The younger friend of the tin robot is the universal <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/block-toys/pp_428577.html%3Flkid%3D10721409">pet of Wall-e,</a> who first needs to be assembled from 687 tiny cubes and details.  Such a designer develops imagination, motor skills, teaches to predict and predict the results of his work, to design.  And most importantly, your younger family member will learn to rejoice at the result of his work and appreciate his own work - the toy collected by hands is not so easy to pick up and break.  The cost of the Valley is only $ 30.53. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/be2/115/927/be2115927933ce800fe7bd688b8dc108.jpg"></div><br>  A bright and useful <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/puzzle-educational/pp_198405.html%3Flkid%3D10721409">puzzle</a> - "pyramid cube".  The toy will help your child to learn the basics of counting, comparing and even understand what negative numbers are.  It is useful for children of preschool and primary school age.  The toy is simple, consists of six decagons, weighs only 45 grams.  Of course, such a ‚Äúdrum‚Äù will not live for you for a long time - either it will bother you or it will wallow, but perhaps this is the case when $ 1 solves several tasks at once and pays for itself. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/13a/aac/400/13aaac400594e299efc8b7e4883cc4d6.jpg"></div><br>  It seems that the snow finally decided to leave Russia, the summer comes into its own and it will sweep like an instant.  In your hands to make it diverse, bright and real summer of childhood, which you then remember all your life.  And most importantly, give your children time and attention, because there is nothing more expensive than picking dandelions and blowing them into daddy‚Äôs face, catching a lizard, making pancakes on the water, racing bicycles to race, eating ice cream and not admitting that angry mom.  All the rest will wait.  Do not lie to yourself.  Will wait. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/403995/">https://habr.com/ru/post/403995/</a></p>
