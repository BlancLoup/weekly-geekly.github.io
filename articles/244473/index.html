      External (or click) factors are most important in the algorithm.  The fact is that search engines are easier to trace the path and actions of users, if they came to the site from the search.  The robots, browsers, and other systems that <b>Google</b> and <b>Yandex</b> work with provide search engines with all the necessary information to determine how valuable each visit was.  Thus, it is better to start strengthening behavioral metrics with the generation of target traffic from a search or with the generation of target traffic through other channels (but at the same time passing it through a search). <br><br><h3>  Technology to improve behavioral factors SeoPult </h3><br>  This fall, <a href="https://seopult.ru/technology/pfactors">SeoPult</a> offered the market a completely new way of working with behavioral factors that was not related to cheats.  How it works? <br><br>  The technology operation scheme involves attracting real users interested in offering advertisers to users who are focused on multiple runet sites.  The <b>DMT</b> (Data Management Platform) <b>UpToLike platform</b> and a number of similar services allow you to find such traffic, which cheat hundreds of thousands of sites and mark their audience according to socio-demographic characteristics, long-term and short-term interests.  Of the total number of users, <b>SeoPult</b> defines ‚Äúreference‚Äù for the website being promoted and attracts them with the help of targeted banners.  In order to obtain a search engine signal about this traffic (external factors), it is carried out through search results, from which, by clicking on the highlighted snippet, it already hits the desired site and shows significant activity. <br>  Briefly, the whole process can be presented with the following theses: SeoPult analyzes the advertiser's site and selects for it the queries included in the <b>TOP-50</b> ; <br><br><ul><li>  under each request several banners are created (their optimal size and content are tested in the process); </li><li>  banners are targetedly shown to the target audience (based on data from DMP) on various websites of the RuNet; </li><li>  when clicking on a banner, the traffic is sent to the search (to the results page, where the target site is located); </li><li>  thanks to a tagged snippet, users choose the site being promoted and move to it from the issuance; </li><li>  further, the behavior of visitors on the site is analyzed, a portrait of the ‚Äúreference user‚Äù is created, which is further taken into account by the algorithm when choosing the optimal audience for displaying banners. </li></ul><br><br>  By optimizing the costs at each stage of the process (choosing low-cost sites, increasing the CTR of the banner, increasing the CTR of the snippet), it is possible to achieve a low price of attracting absolutely real, meaningful to improve PF and highly convertible traffic.  The cost of attracting a user to the site within this technology is on average 11-20 rubles. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/57a/cd4/89e/57acd489e0df4cea801f06b3a70eb3ad.jpg"><br><h3>  Remarketing to work with internal behavioral metrics </h3><br><br>  Remarketing is well suited for working with internal behavioral metrics.  The essence of the technique is to ‚Äúreuse‚Äù the traffic that has already been on the site. <br>  The easiest way to create remarketing campaigns, of course, is Google AdWords.  The service allows you to make enough targeted lists of users for remarketing, show ads in the search (Search Network) or on many other Internet resources, including even YouTube (Display Network). <br>  What are the advantages of remarketing and why is the traffic it attracts especially valuable for strengthening the behavioral metrics of the resource? <br><ul><li>  With high probability you attract interested users.  If a person came to the site once and was disappointed, he is unlikely to decide to visit him again after seeing an advertisement that ‚Äúhaunts‚Äù him on the Internet.  This means that when going to the site, the percentage of refusals will be low, while other behavioral indicators (time on the site, number of active actions, session depth, etc.) are high. </li><li>  Low cost of attracting traffic.  As a rule, when remarketing you pay per click.  Since campaigns are targeted and a significant proportion of untargeted traffic is eliminated, the cost of a targeted click is low (about $ 1 on average). </li><li>  When setting up remarketing campaigns, there is even the possibility of counting the pages that a user viewed on your site.  Thanks to this, you can create narrowly targeted banners or advertisements to achieve maximum effectiveness of each session on the site. </li></ul><br><br><h3>  Monopolization of issue </h3><br>  It is not enough to attract the user to the search page with your site.  It is important to make him choose the resource you are promoting.  An interesting technique is gaining popularity among Western colleagues.  They choose low competitive requests, for which the site already occupies top positions, and try by all means to monopolize the issue.  The main idea is to occupy as large an area as possible on the issue page.  In each case, the strategy and resources are different, but they have one goal - to try to get as many ‚Äúcredits‚Äù as possible in the following positions: <br><ul><li>  at least one, and ideally, several pages of the site with extended snippets (correct titles, beautiful and informative descriptions, pictures, etc.) in the issue; </li><li>  company blog; </li><li>  review sites; </li><li>  map (make sure that your site is displayed on the map along with competitive ones); </li><li>  social networks (regularly updated groups with a huge number of subscribers are also often displayed in the <b>SERP</b> ); </li><li>  advertising (in the West, of course, <b>Google AdWords</b> ads with all sorts of extensions (links, reviews, address, phone, etc.)); </li><li>  Pictures; </li><li>  video (keep in mind that it is the images and videos that often attract attention in the search and have great potential in terms of attracting traffic to the site). </li></ul><br><br>  Ideally, if you can "light up" at least for 1-2 resources, not counting your own site.  Especially if one of these resources is YouTube or a page of your site with a video or illustration posted on it.  Such content, as a rule, occupies a larger area on a page than various textual resources. <br>  An illustrative example of this is companies engaged in various kinds of transportation.  At the request of "carrier + city" at least one of them appears in the issuance of at least 2-3 resources: a site, a map, Google AdWords, a site with reviews, etc. <br><br><h2>  Are there alternatives to motivated traffic? </h2><br>  Under the motivated traffic means a debugged network of users who "click" links to the site, thereby generating a stable "live" traffic.  What is so bad such traffic, if it is created by people, not robots? <br><ul><li>  It does not help the behavioral metrics of the resource, as the majority of visits are characterized by a high percentage of failures or minimal activity on the site. </li><li>  It does not help sales.  Such traffic will bring 0 conversions, because random people who do not care about your services or goods come to the site. </li><li>  It is easily recognized by search engines.  A sharp increase in traffic in general, an increase in traffic from specific regions or even countries where you haven‚Äôt received visitors before (for example, India for an online store with customers in the CIS countries or Kamchatka for a restaurant in Moscow), a high failure rate - all signals for search engines about your use of manipulative techniques. </li></ul><br><br><h3>  Traffic articles from WebArtex </h3><br>  An alternative to motivated SEO traffic was the WebArtex article exchange.  Just a month ago, a new type of article came out of beta testing - <a href="https://webartex.ru/news/42">traffic, with a guarantee of transitions.</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/555/866/f76/555866f7685c48e390518272aa193493.jpg"><br><br>  Articles are published on sites with attendance of <b>500</b> visits a day or more.  Announcements within <b>24</b> hours are on the main pages.  Developers guarantee a minimum of <b>5</b> transitions per month from the date of placement of such an article.  Five - this is exactly the minimum, on average, a forecast is given for several dozen transitions.  It is clear that this is not very much, but we are talking about <b>SEO</b> traffic, which changes the tone of the assessment.  In addition, these transitions are not provided by markups, but at the expense of the quality of the donor site, its ‚Äúliveliness‚Äù as a whole, as well as thanks to the announcement on the main page.  If, under these placement conditions, to provide high-quality text, the result will be even closer to the PR effect. <br><br>  To understand the meaning of such placements, it is important to understand that it is not the number of transitions that is of primary importance (an online store will receive <b>20</b> or <b>50</b> transitions - in general, these are numbers of the same order, and this is not a lot), but the fact of their presence.  Search engines see that visitors from non-search sources come to the site being promoted, that these visitors do something on the site - such indicators play an important role in ranking and give an SEO effect. <br><br>  The cost of placing one traffic article varies from <b>115</b> to <b>8,250</b> rubles (depending on the site indicators).  Developers recommend a monthly volume of such articles - <br>  <b>30-50 pieces</b> . <br><br>  ============== <br><br>  In this article we touched only the newest and most technologically advanced ways of working with behavioral factors and traffic.  In addition to them, there is a fairly large number of ways, completely natural and safe, but more time-consuming in terms of obtaining results.  They are directly related to directly improving the quality of the site, working with social traffic sources, working with content and other aspects that have been repeatedly mentioned in our blog. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/244473/">https://habr.com/ru/post/244473/</a></p>
