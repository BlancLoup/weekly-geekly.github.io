The difficulties of this kind of synchronization are well known, they are associated with a signal delay.  The eJamming company managed to somehow solve these problems, so now musicians can play simultaneously from different corners of the globe, as if they are in the same room for rehearsals.  It seems that eJamming will be a great addition to our life, soaked through with virtual communications.  If we work from home, why not to hold jam sessions together? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Discover the world of cinema with Jaman</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/683/203/67a/68320367a98df451cb089f6608f325ed.png" width="150" height="76" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">  Less than 1% of world films are available to the American viewer.  Startup <a href="http://jaman.com/">Jaman</a> ( <a href="http://www.demo.com/demonstrators/demo2007/91315.php">presentation</a> ) is going to change the situation by streaming movies directly to Windows and Mac desktops using innovative software with better quality than DVD.  In addition to delivering unique films, on top of this channel, the company also creates a social network - on the right side of the movie viewing window there is an interactive control panel, with which you can include comments from other viewers, as well as comment on one or another fragment of the film.  Communicating with other users may distract from watching a movie, but this problem seems to be solved with a great interface. <br><br>  <b>Create your dream home with MyDesignIn</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/792/3ab/d7b/7923abd7b07354e3ff112f722ef3361a.gif" width="150" height="47" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">  Social networks have recently become more and more vertical, and the <a href="http://www.mydesignin.com/">MyDesignIn</a> application ( <a href="http://www.demo.com/demonstrators/demo2007/91293.php">presentation</a> ) is an interesting maneuver.  The site is dedicated to interior design.  Each user can collect ideas and various artifacts for the furnishings of his home and ‚Äútry on‚Äù all of this on his virtual copy, and then discuss the design project with friends and relatives.  The site still needs to grow and develop, but the concept itself seems interesting, and help with home decoration is useful. <br><br>  <b>Create and post a photo on the timeline with Our Story</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/916/9c7/8a4/9169c78a47b052cbfd5e58dbb9d8cffd.png" width="150" height="61" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">  Just at that moment, when we thought that there was nothing new to come up with on the online photo publishing and media market, <a href="http://ourstory.com/">Our Story</a> project ( <a href="http://www.demo.com/demonstrators/demo2007/91340.php">presentation</a> ) appeared and proved that we were wrong.  They took the simple idea that media exists in time and presented a pass-through photo organizer, a storage and publication system.  Photos are organized around events and timelines that can be jointly edited and replenished by users through the site or by e-mail.  There is a built-in ability to print albums.  If <a href="http://www.flickr.com/">Flickr</a> brought us a social photo revolution, then startups such as Our Story take the idea to a new level: one of the most important functions of photography is to record the events of our life.

Protecting our blogs and copyrights is as important as the protection and copyright of print publications.  The <a href="http://blogwerx.com/">Sentinel</a> system ( <a href="http://www.demo.com/demonstrators/demo2007/91314.php">presentation</a> ) tracks and detects any cases of plagiarism on blogs.

These channels can then be launched to play in any SplashCast player installed on any website, blog or personal page profile on a social network.  Since you can choose which channels to launch in your personal player, in fact, you can create your own TV station. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/fd9/77d/7ec/fd977d7ecd0710248a01187084fcbbf9.gif" width="150" height="55" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">  <b>Experience integrated 3D graphics with Total Immersion</b> <br>  <a href="http://www.t-immersion.com/">Total Immersion</a> software ( <a href="http://www.demo.com/demonstrators/demo2007/91367.php">presentation</a> ) allows you to embed interactive 3D graphics directly into a video stream.  This is very impressive and, perhaps, the funniest video among all the demonstrations at the conference.  The effect of introducing full-color 3D graphics into a live video stream looks stunning, and Total Immersion seems to have reached the pinnacle of skill in this endeavor.  Applications can vary from media and entertainment to toys.  According to the description it is difficult to judge the technology, it must be seen. <br><br>  <b>Comment on the web with TrailFire</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/32b/241/438/32b2414380a886461cc12cb6c49661f9.png" width="150" height="55" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">  <a href="http://www.trailfire.com/">TrailFire</a> ( <a href="http://www.demo.com/demonstrators/demo2007/91367.php">presentation</a> ) is a technology for attaching notes to web pages.  If you assign the same name to the notes, then paths are created - individual or collective routes on a particular topic.  The TrailFire system is implemented as a bundle: a browser extension and a website.  All existing routes are available on <a href="http://www.trailfire.com/">trailfire.com</a> and sorted by topic.  Until now, there have been several attempts to implement ‚Äúsocial notes to the web,‚Äù but this system takes the concept to a new level. <br><br>  <b>Manage and piracy over WiFi like a pro with Whisher</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/b55/451/9d0/b554519d0ec22c3240134256fa54cf77.png" width="150" height="83" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">  When was the last time 128-bit encryption stopped pirates?  Definitely not the case with wifi.  The Spanish company <a href="http://www.whisher.com/">Wisher</a> ( <a href="http://www.demo.com/demonstrators/demo2007/91375.php">presentation</a> ) gives you the ability to transfer data via WiFi, without worrying about which network you are currently connected to.  They allow you to connect to the computers of users who are on a secure network.  Sounds weird?  Absolutely!  But do we like it?  Without a doubt. <br><br>  <b>Find people and companies with ZoomInfo</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/14a/e34/d34/14ae34d346752abb7ef91d48c031bac8.gif" width="150" height="36" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">  <a href="http://www.zoominfo.com/">ZoomInfo</a> ( <a href="http://www.demo.com/demonstrators/demo2007/91380.php">presentation</a> ) is a vertical semantic search engine that specializes in companies and people.
