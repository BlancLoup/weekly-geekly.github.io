  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How Dell laptops improve the efficiency of training in the oil and gas industry</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Petrofac is a leading provider of comprehensive services for the oil and gas industry worldwide.  On the island of Sakhalin, the company has an educational and technical center that supports commercial operations in the growing local oil and gas markets.  Considering the specifics of the industry, most training courses are devoted to the technical aspects of the activities of oil and gas companies and work in harsh environments. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/363/022/610/3630226103864f37ae2456205e369024.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Previously, in the Training Center, IT equipment from different manufacturers was used to help students.  Most personal computers are morally and technically outdated and needed to be replaced.  Upgrading the computer ‚Äúpark‚Äù with modern technology made it possible to improve performance and simplify administration, which is already quite complicated, since the Center did not have full-time information technology specialists.  The information technology manager of the Petrofac affiliates in Russia, Evgeny Sobolev, had to revise the IT infrastructure of the training center as much as possible.  This implied the development of documents and administrative instructions for the employees of the center to whom they had to turn when Eugene left for other Petrofac facilities. <br><br>  <b>Listeners learn more effectively on powerful portable devices with Intel processors.</b> <br>  Eugene analyzed the available solutions offered by various vendors, and eventually chose Dell.  The local Dell division offered to use Dell Latitude 3340 laptops with Intel Core i5 processors. <br><blockquote>  Evgeny Sobolev: ‚ÄúWe were impressed by the build quality of Dell laptops designed for educational purposes.  Since these machines run on Intel Core i5 processors, we knew that laptops would support all the programs we needed and would provide excellent performance.  Our decision was right, as Intel-based laptops showed exceptional performance. ‚Äù </blockquote><br>  High-quality assembly allows you to use laptops continuously.  The IT manager was impressed by the reliability of the Dell machines.  A sealed laptop keyboard protects it from liquids, and a rubberized case provides some protection when dropped to the ground.  Yevgeny Sobolev said: ‚ÄúWe have more than 100 training courses, so Dell laptops are used very intensively.  But they were created just for such conditions and show reliable work from day one, helping our listeners to succeed. ‚Äù <br><br>  <b>Information technology by 50% reduces the time spent on administration, allowing you to work on strategic projects.</b> <br>  The Dell solution also used the proprietary Dell Mobile Computing Cart counter, which was very important for Evgeny Sobolev.  ‚ÄúI haven't seen anything like it from other manufacturers,‚Äù he said.  The rack allows Eugene to remotely control laptops through the built-in Ethernet switch.  ‚ÄúThanks to the Dell stand, we can reduce the time to administer at least twice.  Now I can remotely install and update software and devote more time to working on strategic projects, ‚Äùhe added. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/85b/24c/1b8/85b24c1b8c9f4b87939bcd7b100e1440.png" width="600"></div><br>  The Dell Mobile Computing Cart Rack was designed by the company for conveniently transporting, recharging and storing devices used in classrooms.  This design holds up to 30 netbooks, ultrabooks, laptops and / or tablets from different manufacturers with a screen diagonal of up to 14 inches. <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">We hid its features and advantages under the spoiler.</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><ul><li>  The 30-seat open architecture is suitable for most tablets, netbooks, ultrabooks and laptops with a screen up to 14 ". <br>  - Compact form factor is maintained at different position of the door; <br>  - devices are stored on open shelves, easily removed for use; <br>  - cable organizers on the shelves for easy maintenance; <br>  - ventilated shelves, to ensure air circulation; <br>  - special cutouts in the shelves for easy removal of devices; <br>  - shelves can be removed to provide extra storage space; <br>  - two external sockets for power supply of auxiliary equipment; <br>  - LED indicators of power status or failure, indicating a power failure or temperature conditions; <br>  - the built-in cable storage system protects the external Ethernet cable (managed trolleys) and power cable from damage; <br>  - sliding door mechanism reduces the need for open space during loading and unloading devices. </li><li>  The electrical device charging system uses patented PowerShuttle technology to control power consumption: <br>  - optimized charging time for mobile devices in the rack; <br>  - voltage is not supplied to the empty shelf; <br>  - safe charging of mobile devices when using the basket through the external auxiliary outputs; <br>  - to start charging does not require user intervention. </li><li>  Device Protection: <br>  - locked steel doors are moved apart on opposite sides of the rack to provide access to mobile devices from both sides; <br>  - the ergonomic handle is designed for easy opening;  can also be used to secure the rack to a fixed point with a cable lock; <br>  - power adapters and IT equipment are stored in a separate section from mobile devices - end users cannot access the cables and power supply system; <br>  - the top rack compartment provides power to the Ethernet switch (for a guided cart) and WAP / wireless router <br>  (sold separately); <br>  - power adapters are fixed on the shelves; <br>  - the heat sink system is controlled by the installed fans. </li></ul></div></div><br>  Mobile rack increases efficiency and does not require skills in working with information technologies. The advantages of a branded rack are much broader than reducing the time for administration.  Evgeny Sobolev emphasizes the convenience of wiring in the rack, which charges the device and supports remote administration.  ‚ÄúTo use the Dell counter, you don‚Äôt need experience with computers, so when a Center employee prepares it, he doesn‚Äôt need my support.  There were no problems, ‚Äùsays Eugene.

      <b>Laptops do not need to turn off and specifically monitor their safety.</b> <br>  Listeners do not have to charge laptops during the day, because they receive them with a full charge, which is enough for a whole day of classes.  And more importantly, at night the cars are locked behind the steel doors of the rack, and at the beginning of each day they are ready for use and are already turned on.  ‚ÄúWe made sure that laptops in combination with the Dell brand stand work very well.  By choosing the Dell Mobile Computing Cart rack, we achieved maximum efficiency in investing in Dell Latitude laptops, ‚Äùsaid Yevgeny Sobolev. <br><br>  Consult with Dell specialists about the company's solutions for your business, you can by clicking <a href="https://marketing.dell.com/russia/solutions">on this link</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/368739/">https://habr.com/ru/post/368739/</a></p>
