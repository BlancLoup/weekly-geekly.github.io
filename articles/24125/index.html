Let's try to understand why. <br><table><tbody><tr><td><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/19e/491/fef/19e491fefad4063ce9e8057dba4c31a9.png" width="284" height="101" alt="Vkontakte.ru" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left"></td><td>  <b>Vkontakte.ru</b> was launched in autumn 2006 and as of April 2008 has 11 million users. </td></tr></tbody></table><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/8f9/4b4/19f/8f94b419f3b0d2e5ad7363e4f933b313.jpg" width="450" height="221" alt="Vkontakte.ru - Alexa" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br>  <b>Page views over the past six months - vkontakte.ru</b> <a name="habracut"></a><br><table><tbody><tr><td><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/35d/d77/097/35dd7709716f9f22b464dd16a93588be.png" width="178" height="101" alt="Odnoklassniki.ru" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left"></td><td>  The project <b>Odnoklassniki.ru</b> was launched in March 2006 and as of April 2008 has 15 million users. </td></tr></tbody></table><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/5e9/c75/cb7/5e9c75cb7143a1dc19c4a5bc718b3155.jpg" width="450" height="221" alt="Odnoklassniki.ru - Alexa" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br>  <b>Page views over the past six months - odnoklassniki.ru</b> <br>  So what is the secret to the success of these social networks?  The answer lies on the surface: both social networks exploit <b>real offline social connections between people online</b> .  Since the main requirement of these networks is registration under a real name and surname, the search or invitation of the right person is just 30 seconds. <br>  If before the world in the minds of people was divided into online (often associated with something virtual, unnatural, sort of its own microworld) and offline, then thanks to social networks online it became just a continuation of offline. <br><br><h2>  Consider another interesting point: VKontakte never and never advertised.  How did he manage to gain 11 million users in 16 months? </h2><br>  First, according to the creators of the project, they already had several popular student projects, the audience from which was "transferred" to Vkontakte.ru.  Thus, the start was given - the community began to live.  Secondly, Vkontakte is a technically very advanced resource.  Both from the point of view of usability, and from the point of view of quantity and quality of the provided services.  The main audience - students, among whom there is the largest number of progressive geeks.  That, in fact, led to the fact that users began to invite each other.  The site administration only welcomed this and distributed iPods to the right and left. <br><br>  <b>Please note that VKontakte has a lot of current students, not graduates (and the project was originally planned for graduates).</b>  <b>It also shows that the knowledge of Vkontakte was passed from mouth to mouth behind the institute bench.</b>

    <h2>  Now consider the Odnoklassniki.ru promotion model: </h2><br>  Advertisement of the project was actively circulating on the Internet, which is quite natural: you can't tell your former classmates so quickly about the project; after all, we no longer sit at the same desk with them.  However, ‚ÄúWord of mouth‚Äù played a significant role here, because even those small drops of communication ‚ÄúHello, mash, how are you, something I can't find you in classmates‚Äù promoted the project word of mouth. <br><br><h2>  Consider another popular project - LovePlanet.ru </h2><br>  LovePlanet.ru is a dating site, the number of users of which also exceeded 10 million. <br><br>  Let's remember how the portal was advertised: advertising in elevators, at bus stops, a huge number of banners on the Internet.  I am sure that the portal promotion budgets amounted to millions of dollars. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/761/069/758/761069758b852f59b91550450fc926b1.jpg" width="450" height="221" alt="Loveplanet.ru - Alexa" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br>  <b>Page views over the past six months - loveplanet.ru</b> <br><br><h2>  And now let's draw conclusions from the data below: </h2><br>  As you know, the cost of promotion of the project constitute a large part of the project budget. <br><br>  The last thing I spent on promotion was <b>vkontakte.ru</b> , and we see that the indicator of the number of page views of the project continues to grow. <br><br>  A significantly larger amount was spent on promotion <b>odnoklassniki.ru</b> , and we see that the indicator of the number of page views has stabilized and stopped growing.  Most likely, this suggests that the limit on the number of registered users is close: everyone who wanted to register has already registered. <br><br>  Apparently, the biggest expenses for promotion incurred project <b>loveplanet.ru</b> , and we see that the indicator of the number of page views falls.  Most likely, this indicates that more and more users prefer social networks rather than dating sites. <br><br>  <b>We also draw attention to the fact that classmates and VKontakte are closed resources.</b> <br><br><h2>  So, how to make another millionaire social network without investing millions of dollars? </h2><br><ol><li>  Social network should use social connections of users in the real world </li><li>  Users must be registered with real names and surnames, otherwise item 1 will not work </li><li>  <b>You will be able to significantly reduce advertising costs if there is active offline communication between the users of your social network</b> </li><li>  The network must be closed </li></ol><br><br><h2>  What kind of social network is worth doing? </h2><br>  I will say for sure that it is unlikely that you will be able to create the second ‚ÄúClassmates‚Äù or ‚ÄúVkontakte‚Äù.  And if it works out - it will be really very expensive, because the main thing in these projects is an active user base that exceeds 10 million people. <br><br>  <b>Let's look at the most popular social connections:</b> <br><ul><li>  Social connection ‚ÄúStudying together at school‚Äù - busy (classmates.ru) </li><li>  Social connection ‚ÄúStudying together at the university‚Äù - busy (Vkontakte.ru) </li><li>  Social connection "We work / whether together" - busy? </li></ul><br><br>  A person finishes school (classmates), then an institute (VKontakte), and then gets a job! <br><br>  You never wanted to find your colleague, with whom you worked 5 years ago, to discuss his career success, find out where he now works, what his position and what salary?  Have you ever wanted to know what happened to the ‚ÄúSharashkin office‚Äù in which you started your career?  Have you ever wanted to look at a new secretary in a company that you quit two weeks ago from? <br><br><h2>  At the moment, there is no social network in Russia that fully supports the social connection ‚Äúwork / whether together‚Äù </h2><br>  Will you say "My Circle"?  Yes, this is a business social network.  Let's look at its performance: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/e4c/4aa/b48/e4c4aab48ec915199f972dd575c11134.jpg" width="450" height="221" alt="MoiKrug.ru - Alexa" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br>  <b>Page views over the past six months - moikrug.ru</b> <br><br>  As you can see, the situation is not the best.  The index of page views is falling. <br><br>  Let's see what is happening: My circle is an excellent social network that perfectly exploits the idea: each person knows each one through N handshakes.  At the same time, in our opinion, in ‚ÄúMy Circle‚Äù almost no attention is paid to companies in which people work.  And after all, it was thanks to companies that people found social connections. <br><br>  Take the example of "VKontakte": <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/71d/0d9/252/71d0d9252603594d0f8411a67bae9d23.jpg" width="450" height="252" alt="Vkontakte" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><br>  Pay attention to what place is given to the university and its faculties, how easy and fast you can find your classmates, find events and meetings created by classmates. <br><br><h2>  findings </h2><br><ul><li>  A social network oriented to the mass user should use the connections of users in the real world. </li><li>  At the moment, there is no social network in Russia that fully supports the social connection ‚Äúwork / whether together‚Äù </li></ul><br><br>  There is the last week of the development of our new social network, which is called - " <b>Our Office</b> ".  Over the last few months of hard work, but the result justifies its expectations. <br><br>  The social network ‚Äú <b>Our Office</b> ‚Äù groups people into offices - each office here has its own page through which you can find employees, attend a chat, take part in a discussion of current topics, view corporate photo albums or simply schedule a meeting.  Also, the users of ‚Äú <b>Our office</b> ‚Äù social network can follow the career of their current and current colleagues, watching the change of jobs and promotion. <br><br>  Soon we will show a lot of interesting features of ‚Äú <b>Our office</b> ‚Äù - but we will notify the community about this a week later. <br><br>  One last thing: we plan to make " <b>Our Office</b> " as much as possible deployed to the end user, so we will always welcome your advice, suggestions and suggestions. <br><br>  Especially for this, we created a new community - ‚Äú <b>Project our office</b> ‚Äù.  We ask you to join this community of everyone who is watching the development of the first office startup.  In this community will be announced the most interesting and relevant news of the project. <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blog/nashofis/">habrahabr.ru/blog/nashofis</a> <br><br>  So, see you soon. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/24125/">https://habr.com/ru/post/24125/</a></p>
