Games are sophisticated, untamed monsters connected by something like digital tape.  No wonder they fall apart. <br><br>  <i>Aliens: Colonial Marines</i> was problematic for many reasons, but quickly became a general ridicule when similar viral <a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/sega-Vy32hXQoMiYSc">clips</a> appeared in which xenomorphs wander around meaninglessly.  This month, the developer of mods <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2018/07/14/xenos-in-aliens-colonial-marines-de-lobotomized-by-fixing-a-typo">discovered</a> that the reason for the stupid AI behavior of "alien" was one mistake in the game code.  (This was <a href="https://habr.com/post/417435/">an article</a> on Habr√©.) Oops.  But this is not the only case this year, when the game was humiliated due to a missed typing error.  In early 2018, fans discovered that the <i>Civilization VI</i> AI was suspiciously hitting a religion: it turned out that the <a href="https://kotaku.com/fans-discover-game-changing-typo-in-civilization-vis-co-1823845314">word ‚Äúyield‚Äù was written in the code as ‚Äúyeild‚Äù</a> . <br><br>  Therefore, it is not surprising to know that the development of games is full of such moments.

      Lea Miller worked for several years as a designer at Mythic Entertainment, a former MMO games developer.  She worked on scenarios, content design and systems for <i>Dark Age of Camelot</i> and <i>Warhammer Online: Age of Reckoning</i> .  At the time of release, the studio began to receive complaints from fans: the game seemed slow and unresponsive.  Players could not determine what exactly was the reason. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Was it just a ... feeling? <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe development team revised the combat system to make it feel faster, and looked for inefficient server-side operations that could be eliminated,‚Äù Miller says.  ‚ÄúBut still, the reviews were too vague, no one could say exactly what the reason was.  Was this a flaw in the overall design of the game?  Many changes have been made to improve the feel of the game, and although many of these were real improvements, the root of all problems could not be eliminated. ‚Äù <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/563/861/0c2/5638610c2536fe868d842dc0f147452b.jpg" alt="image"></div><br>  <i>Warhammer Online did not gather a large audience and as a result was closed in 2013.</i> <br><br>  Delving into the code for six months, the development team could not find a solution. <br><br>  One of the relatively new programmers studied the <i>Age of Reckoning</i> code and discovered something strange.  It still had a line related to the previous MMO studio, <i>Dark Age of Camelot</i> .  She handled the players on the daylap.  Yes, on a daylap.  <i>Dark Age of Camelot</i> was released in 2001, in an era when broadband connectivity has not yet become the standard.  At that time, players had to make sure that no one picked up the phone, otherwise the connection was broken.  (The day my family bought the 56K modem was magical.) <br><br>  ‚ÄúHe recently worked for the company and was not familiar with the code,‚Äù Miller says.  "And maybe that's why he studied this fragment more closely than the others before him." <br><br>  After deleting the line, the problem disappeared.  The game became smooth again. <br><br>  So what happened?  Computers are powerful these days, and the Internet is fast.  But at the beginning of the MMO era, everything was different, that is, the games had to make compromises. <br><br>  ‚ÄúIn the network code, <i>Dark Age of Camelot</i> was the only line that artificially slowed down the frequency of transmission of a certain type of data by the client and server,‚Äù explains Miller.  ‚ÄúI believe that the main purpose of this was to optimize the network load, but perhaps it was part of a system designed to enable players to dial in through the dialup to be competitive in PvP.  This delay was almost imperceptible to players in the <i>Dark Age of Camelot</i> , because the game booster was tailored to the standard bandwidth and computing power of that era.  Only a very small proportion of players had systems that could process data faster than they were sent and received. ‚Äù <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c36/609/979/c36609979079c464fdaad1eabc3ed9a5.jpg"></div><br>  <i>Unlike Warhammer Online, Dark Age of Camelot is still afloat.</i> <br><br>  In the development of <i>Dark Age of Camelot,</i> its network code also evolved and dealt with such functions as managing peak delay values, logging into servers and other tasks.  After a decade of <i>Dark Age of Camelot work</i> , Mythic Studio decided to transfer the same code to <i>Age of Reckoning</i> . <br><br>  As it turned out, he broke the functionality in a completely unexpected place. <br><br>  By the time Mythic fixed the problem, most players had returned to <i>World of Warcraft</i> .  This bug was not the only cause of <i>Age of Reckoning</i> problems, but it contributed to them. <br><br>  Miller wrote to me when I publicly asked on Twitter to tell about other horrible stories, even if the examples concerned not only such absurdities as typos.  The discussion coincided with discussions in other circles after the incident with the <i>Colonial Marines</i> , and I would like to share the most outstanding stories. <br><br><div class="oembed"><twitter-widget class="twitter-tweet twitter-tweet-rendered" id="twitter-widget-0" style="position: static;
