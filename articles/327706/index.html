A fascinating event where IT people from all over the country gathered, who, in between drinking alcoholic beverages and singing songs with a guitar, fired themes.  And now, amidst this fun, I found that hanging out in a tin can in the middle of the reservoir is not only fun, but also informative in terms of conducting IT research. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/55b/84b/1bd/55b84b1bda69469c9660a60a0609f349.png" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  It all started with the fact that Google maps began to fool and show my location not in the vast expanses of the Gorky reservoir, but somewhere in Tomsk.  And I was not the only one - isdefovtsy showed screens of smartphones and said "look where I am."  Replacing Google maps with Yandex cards did not solve the problem, as did the launch of MapsME (I didn‚Äôt think there was any Internet on the boat, but it works with locally stored maps), as well as an attempt to reset the gps cache in the smartphone.  Tomsk and that's it.  Although stop, we are again in the Lower, and now in St. Petersburg, and now in Tomsk. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c0d/707/1aa/c0d7071aaf454b7c970ed3761a9b34eb.png" alt="image">

      Google did not save the jumps to Tomsk, but I swear we were there.  But even without Tomsk, it is clearly visible that for some time I am on a ship, and then suddenly I find myself hundreds of kilometers from the current location. <br><br>  One of the jumps to Nizhny Novgorod helped to solve the riddle - we were near the pier from which we sailed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/21d/96f/3df/21d96f3dfb6f449aa386e5d59a795922.png" alt="image"><br><br>  At the time of this "jump" I was in a bar in which there is wi-fi (there was no Internet, but there was a wifi. It was just like a training pool with a tower, but without water.) It was very similar to the fact that Google remembered the coordinates of wifi and being inside the can, without a satellite signal, is trying to somehow solve the positioning problem. <br><br>  Eureka!  The conference is attended by several people from Tomsk!  Most likely, one of them distributes wi-fi from a smartphone for your laptop.  Google remembers where he saw it and throws others in Tomsk. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/549/b78/d6f/549b78d6fa56442499f054b5de10a21f.png" alt="image"><br><br>  But Tomsk left the bar and came St. Petersburg.  Well, well, people, where do you live there? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d88/7dc/492/d887dc492d794ca7afa9c020c90ff9a6.png" alt="image"><br><br>  St. Petersburg, st.  Furniture, d. 12 K.1.  Business center "Aviator". <br><br>  Further logic is clear: <br><br><ol><li>  order a drink at the bar (for conspiracy) </li><li>  we look where threw </li><li>  screenshot </li><li>  screenshot of the list of available wi-fi grids </li><li>  We look at who is in the bar (not necessarily with a laptop) </li><li>  repeat (including the first paragraph) </li><li>  We collect data and play <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluedo">Cluedo</a> </li></ol><br>  There is only one ‚Äúbut‚Äù - I tried it and this wonderful plan came to my mind after I came home and slept off. <br><br>  But for the next cruise I will be prepared and will not miss my chance! <br><br>  <b>Update:</b> <br><br>  It turns out that some people do not understand what it is about. <br><br>  The car removing the Street View also collects a list of wi-fi networks with their coordinates. <br><br>  If you set "high accuracy" in the Android settings, then the smartphone will do the same. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fa9/eb0/cfc/fa9eb0cfc0ec403c93739cd76a5dc00f.png" alt="image"><br><br>  If you are in a room with poor visibility of GPS satellites (and a can floating in grounded water is a perfect screen), then Google's Location Service comes in and makes a guess where you are based on cell tower lists and wifi grids. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7af/91b/b8f/7af91bb8fafc4169a00b96ce716fc0f3.png" alt="image"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/327706/">https://habr.com/ru/post/327706/</a></p>
