Almost 7 years have passed since the moment when the Black Hat conference presented an attack on Intel ME technology for the Q35 chipset.  Since then, this chipset is considered defective, and Intel introduced 7 new series of chipsets.  In the report we will analyze Intel ME / AMT / vPro technology in detail, demonstrate and analyze the known attack on Q35 (yes, we managed to find this rarity on one of the flea markets!).  We will launch a web server with removed RAM memory strips and show what has changed in 7 generations of chipsets in terms of security. </li><li>  <b>Evgeny Usov: "Enclave Power Armor".</b>  The report will contain a description of the Intel SGX technology, examples of the application of this technology in practice, and for the development of both malicious and protected programs.  Let's tell about features of development of the applications using this technology. </li><li>  <b>Maxim Glame: ‚ÄúIntel MPX.</b>  <b>A new solution to old problems.</b>  Intel Memory Protection Extensions (MPX) is a new Intel architecture extension that first appeared in Intel Skylake processors.  It is designed to improve the reliability of applications and solve a long-standing problem - the problem of buffer overflow.  To do this, Intel Skylake processors have been added a new set of instructions and new registers that allow you to control the buffer boundaries and detect overflow during program execution.  We will tell you how it works, how to use it, and what profit the use of Intel MPX gives. </li><li>  <b>Denis Strelnikov: "Cyberfesh of May Professional: Spring-Summer 2016 Collection".</b>  The report will deal with the safety of modern representatives of wearable electronics: smart watches, fitness bracelets and other devices, which every year more and more can be seen in everyone.  What are the potential threats of using these devices?  How to protect your smart assistant?  What new methods of attack appeared along with the popularization of wearable electronics?  All these questions will be answered, and one of the new attacks on users of smart watches will be demonstrated! </li><li>  <b>Sergei Sychev: "Journey from St. Petersburg to Moscow: the security of public wireless networks."</b>  Wireless networks are very common in the life of an ordinary person.  It is difficult to find a public place where an open access point would not be available.  The speaker will present a security analysis using the example of a wireless network in a popular high-speed train.  Let us show what banal administration errors can lead to, and try to decide whether to avoid connecting to public access points or is it just paranoia? </li><li>  <b>Alexey Myasnikov: ‚ÄúNFC and HCE.</b>  <b>Wireless Password Manager.</b>  The term " <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near_Field_Communication">NFC</a> " is increasingly found in the specifications of modern smartphones and tablets.  The report will look at this interface in detail from the point of view of practical application.  Let us consider the different modes of operation and types of interacting devices.  There will also be considered the implementation of HCE technology in modern phones, aspects of its security.  As a demonstration, let us present the coding of the password manager under the Android OS.  Data will be transmitted using the interface. </li><li>  <b>Evgeny Pavlenko: ‚ÄúMobile antiviruses?</b>  <b>No, have not heard".</b>  The report will present a security assessment of mobile applications for the Google Android operating system.  The speaker will talk about existing means of protecting mobile devices and the shortcomings of existing antiviruses for Android. </li><li>  <b>Maxim Khazov: ‚ÄúIs it difficult to become a‚Äú chameleon ‚Äùin social networks?‚Äù.</b>  As a rule, modern mobile applications use a certain API to interact with the server.  The report will tell you why you may need to analyze the interaction protocol and this API itself, as well as possible approaches to its analysis.  Let's analyze possible technologies of developers for more reliable protection of the communication channel between the client and the server ( <a href="https://www.emaro-ssl.ru/blog/ssl-pinning-for-android/">SSL Pinning</a> ).  We show a successful bypass of these technologies in the popular mobile application (Facebook) in order to get an opportunity to analyze the API.  As a result, we will show how you can write the simplest bots for some social networks that will be disguised as official mobile applications. </li><li>  <b>Yegor Malyshev and Andrei Dremov: "Zaalaykay me completely."</b>  Currently, social networks have become a powerful tool for influencing public opinion.  It's no secret that they were used in the Tunisian <a href="http://www.golos-ameriki.ru/a/cyberrevolution-tauinis-2011-01-17-113877164/192340.html">Jasmine Revolution</a> (and some even call it cyber-revolution!), And are now used, for example, to create a positive image of a politician, which is especially important before the elections.  For a massive impact on people's opinions, automatically controlled accounts in social networks, in other words, bots, are used.  Let's tell how to find them, on the example of the social network "VKontakte"! </li><li>  <b>Alexey Busygin: ‚ÄúNightmare of compromised keys‚Äù.</b>  Should we be afraid of the ‚Äúman in the middle‚Äù if the server's TLS key was once compromised?  Even if the server has already been updated three times, the vulnerability is closed and gradually becomes history, and the old certificate has been revoked and replaced with a new one, the answer ‚Äúno, not worth it‚Äù is very hasty.  This report is devoted to a more detailed answer to this question.  The report will examine in detail the problem of checking certificate revocation, demonstrate the vulnerability of modern web browsers to a man-in-the-middle attack using keys with revoked certificates, and also consider various approaches to protecting against this attack. </li><li>  <b>Roman Demidov: "Under the hood of a Flash."</b>  The report will provide an overview of the security of Adobe Flash over the past year, which turned out to be very difficult for its creators.  The number of vulnerabilities discovered in 2014-2015 reached a record: 457 pieces!  Many large companies refuse to support Flash in their products due to security issues.  Architectural features of Flash, popular attack vectors and patterned exploitation methods will be considered.  We will analyze the most recent recent vulnerabilities, information about which has been made publicly available.  In addition, the report will present its own results in terms of Flash security research - we will show the vulnerabilities we found and understand their causes. </li></ol><br><br><h4>  <b>In addition to reports</b> </h4><br>  The guests are waited by the NeoQUEST-2016 program, which is very rich in reports, but can't they sit all day and listen, listen, listen?  We will dilute the reports with demonstrations of attacks and various ‚Äúhowto‚Äù, in particular, we will show the attack of Rutkovskaya, the attack on ‚Äúsmart watches‚Äù, we will tell about Intel <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_Guard_Extensions">SGX</a> (and there is very little Russian-language information about SGX!) Android and much more! <br><br>  In addition, all guests will have a chance to express themselves in competitions: real - for extroverts and virtual - for introverts.  And for contests, as you know, prizes are awarded! <br><br>  NeoQUEST is another reason why this summer is in St. Petersburg! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/304028/">https://habr.com/ru/post/304028/</a></p>
