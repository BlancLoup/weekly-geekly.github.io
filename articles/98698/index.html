As they say: "For closeness to the people and transparency of action."  In times of extinction of traditional media, the outcome of the elections will largely be determined by the positions on the Internet, and the struggle has already begun. <br><br>  I think we should start ‚Äúfrom above‚Äù, with Dmitry Medvedev, with his <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/blog_medvedev/">diary</a> , in which videos and text addresses of the President are published.  The community is moderated.  Sharp comments are usually deleted.  Dmitry Anatolyevich writes, of course, not himself. <br><br>  Here is <a href="http://twitter.com/kremlinRussia">Medvedev</a> 's recently registered <a href="http://twitter.com/kremlinRussia">twitter</a> , which he started during a trip to the USA.  But recently appeared in the network <a href="http://twitter.com/kermlinRussia">parody of this microblogging</a> , whose name differs from the presidential one only by one letter.  You should first read the messages Medvedev, and then parodies on them and compare.  Sometimes it comes out very funny.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br>  Chairman of the State Duma Boris Gryzlov in his <a href="http://bv-gryzlov.livejournal.com/">blog</a> likewise does not allow himself, the position is not right.  True, a recent <a href="http://bv-gryzlov.livejournal.com/30542.html">post about the MUZ-TV award</a> and about the ‚Äúspecial role of popular music in the life of the majority of citizens of the country‚Äù is a little out of context.  Can not argue.  Boris, now you are in your board. <br><br>  Federation Council Chairman <a href="http://sergey-mironov.livejournal.com/">Sergei Mironov is</a> actively touring the Russian outback.  He does not forget to periodically upload photo reports, where he meets and embraces with doctors, grandmothers, scientists and other vulnerable people.  What can you say?  - Golden You are a man, Sergey Mikhailovich. <br><br>  A little sad for Vladimir Volfovich.  His blog posts called <a href="http://blogs.mail.ru/mail/zhirinovskyvv">‚ÄúWatch and Listen to Zhirinovsky,‚Äù</a> look toothless.  Without active gesticulation, hypnotically acting on the people, and harsh statements, his blog posts do not reach the very heart of an ordinary user.  Maybe because he writes, of course, not himself. <br><br>  It is necessary to note the <a href="http://ya-kadyrov.livejournal.com/">fresh blog of Ramzan Kadyrov</a> , who went crazy after the publication of the post, suspiciously resembling the post appeared the day before in LJ Adam Delimkhanov, State Duma deputy (by the way, his blog has already been removed, as is the duplicate post in Kadyrov's blog).  It is also possible to comment there.  All these flaws, the creators wrote off on the test mode blog.  And the photo of Kadyrov on a jurus is really very reminiscent of Misha Galustyan. <br><br>  LJ called <a href="http://mer-v-tyurme.livejournal.com/">‚ÄúMayor in Prison‚Äù</a> is led by Arthur Shmatko, mayor of the suburban town of Ozyory, detained for taking a bribe.  Here you can read and appeal to Medvedev about the illegality of his detention.  Since April, LiveJournal is not updated.  Apparently in prison, Wi-Fi does not catch.  You need to save the mayor!  Continuing the criminal theme, I also want to mention the <a href="http://alshestun.livejournal.com/">blog of Alexander Shestun</a> , in which he also denies the accusations of bribes for fraud with the land.  The tradition of video contacting Medvedev is also supported by them. <br><br>  In general, official blogs are boring job reports, although online diaries are created for this purpose - to cover daily life.  But still they are knocked out of the genre.  True, the lower we fall, the less officialdom, further from politics and (finally) closer to the people.  Live Magazines livelier.  People write here themselves, not the press office or secretaries.  It turns out that human weaknesses are also inherent in deputies and politicians. <br>  They write a lot about football.  The head of the Oleninsky District Administration of the Tver Region, <a href="http://oleg-dubov.livejournal.com/">Oleg Dubov</a> , a hot fan, <a href="http://oleg-dubov.livejournal.com/148797.html">comments on the semi-final of the World Championship</a> almost online.  The deputy of the Legislative Assembly of the Perm Territory and a member of the United Russia party <a href="http://agishev.livejournal.com/">Andrei Agishev</a> are not indifferent to football either.  He also does not hesitate to give <a href="http://agishev.livejournal.com/33854.html">Comedy Club performances by</a> publishing a video with a song about Gazprom and <a href="http://agishev.livejournal.com/32147.html">Medvedev's aphorisms</a> , such as ‚ÄúAt once, of course, gingerbreads do not fall on top.‚Äù <br><br>  "Our response to the governor of California."  <a href="http://belyh.livejournal.com/471517.html">Photo of the Governor of the Kirov region Nikita Belykh</a> . <br><br>  State Duma deputy <a href="http://davitiashvili.livejournal.com/">Denis Davitiashvili</a> has warm feelings for the music of Tokio (not Hotel). <br>  Keep up with men and women politicians.  Here is a recent <a href="http://lebedinskay.livejournal.com/137783.html">photo report from the hot roads of Samara,</a> advisor to the mayor of Lebedinskaya Elena. <br><br>  <a href="http://a-kabaeva.livejournal.com/">The blog of State Duma deputy Alina Kabaeva</a> has little to do with politics, in fact, like Alina herself.  Here is the main video of her program on channel 5, ‚ÄúSteps towards success‚Äù.  Publishes all the press service, and it is not hidden. <br>  In the US, there are even a few rules for politicians leading their blog.  The main advice - think before you publish something.  Check: <br>  1. Do you happen to reveal the names of your colleagues, employees, relatives? <br>  2. Do you warn your friends to carefully publish photos where you are present? <br>  3. When you publish a photo, check whether there are any informative details on the background (a cabinet with documents, where the labeling of folders is visible, paper on the desk, computer screen), is it possible to see something in the reflective surfaces? <br>  4. When publishing files, is there any sensitive information (organization name, position, names, revision history) in the name and properties of the document? <br><br>  <a href="http://www.goslyudi.ru/bloglist/">Here</a> you can find the most comprehensive list of blogs of politicians, there are about 200 in total. <br>  <a href="http://www.gosblogi.ru/">Here are the</a> most popular posts of politicians in recent days. <br><br>  I guess what all this fuss around the LJ will lead to.  With such a low attendance at meetings of the State Duma of the Russian Federation, the chairman of the State Duma, Boris Gryzlov, will create a closed community.  And all the bills will be discussed directly in the comments. <br><br>  In general, officials are taking root in the blogosphere with difficulty.  The slogans ‚ÄúFactory for Workers, Land for Peasants‚Äù are not met with enthusiasm, because all the gullible grandmothers who pecked at it remained offline.  For now, the statement by top blogger Artemy Lebedev - " <a href="http://tema.livejournal.com/503312.html%3Fpage%3D2">asshole and member of the Fair Russia party</a> " is closer to the people.  Great political slogan?  Give Lebedev presidential! <br><br>  In the elections of 2018, when television and radio are forgotten, and the power of state channels subsides, the name of the new president of the Russian Federation can be predicted with high probability by looking at the ‚ÄúMost Popular Magazines‚Äù section of <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/ratings/users/">LiveJournal.com</a> . <br><br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/98698/">https://habr.com/ru/post/98698/</a></p>
