  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Overnight project</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  It happened on October 28, 2009 in the city of Novosibirsk.  It was the usual autumn evening, we were returning home from the cinema on the subway, and nothing seemed to foretell a sleepless night, when suddenly an idea came to Danilo‚Äôs mind, which later took the whole night to bring it to life.  As it turned out, Danil had long wanted to fiction something like that, but you know how it happens: <a name="habracut"></a>  we forget, do not have time, time, deeds, in a word, vanity.  In general, the idea was to create another startup with various quotations, which can be put, for example, as a homepage. <br><br><h3>  Process </h3>  It would seem that it is necessary to prepare in advance and discuss everything, but this is no longer the case.  Everything happened quite quickly.  The time and place to create the site were quickly selected.  The time is night because the clock was already around nine in the evening, and during the day students need to learn, there is no time, and it is not so interesting.  ‚ÄúIl Patio‚Äù was chosen as a workplace because it turned out to be the only restaurant in the city that worked at night, and in which they no longer hoped to dream about outlets near the table, according to this, the bartender had to periodically distract from the drowsiness near beer kegs and force me to change one charged on another. <br>  Voila, things are easy, decide on a plan and get to work.  The main purpose was the creation of a site with known expressions, in which there will be nothing superfluous, and nothing will distract attention from the main idea.  The task was to do the impossible - to do the work in one night. <br>  It took literally 10‚Äì15 minutes to develop a plan.  Further, during the entire working night, they posted everything on twitter.  Actually, the link: At the same time, the creation of the base was thought out, an article on Habr, photographs, paper versions of expressions, their assembly and printing were taken, they thought about the domain. <br>  As a result, by the morning we have a <s>clever portal with a</s> simplest page with a random phrase ‚Äî deep thought of a universal scale, with a click on which we will receive a new, no less profound maxim, if, of course, you have not reached the end. <br><br><h3>  What's inside </h3>  Since there was little time and a lot of work, everything was limited to two primitive tablets in the database, the complete absence of design, hundreds of sayings and clean php with crutches from previous projects. <br>  SELECT * FROM `table1` WHERE` id` NOT IN (SELECT smth FROM `table2`) <br>  Since by chance there were quite a lot of server resources at hand, optimization and caching went out of my head.
