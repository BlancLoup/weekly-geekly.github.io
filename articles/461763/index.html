And you <i>thought</i> about ordering the services of an advertising agency to increase the number of customers. <br><br>  <b>What's better?</b>  Set up advertising yourself or outsource the agency?  Now we <i>will figure it out together.</i> <br><br>  <b>Let's meet first!</b>

      I am a guy and I am 23 years old, I have been friends with advertising for more than 2 years.  He was one of the founders of the agency for the provision of advertising services in social networks.  Already set up more than 75 advertising campaigns for small and medium-sized businesses.  At the moment I do not work with the agency, I have a start-up startup in another area.  I will prove that advertising agencies at the start of the way only kill the business. <br><br>  You have a small business, in which you are well versed, but there is one <b>BUT</b> .  You are not competent in advertising.  Of course, I would like to increase the number of customers, and advertising agencies talk about the Golden Mountains and scare you that you can‚Äôt cope with as many potential customers that they are ready to provide. <br><br>  It certainly looks beautiful, <i>is it really so?</i> <br><br>  <b>What to do in this case?</b> <br><br>  Do not rush to give money, read the following information carefully and <i>make the right choice for yourself.</i> <br><blockquote>  Better than you, no one will advertise your business <br></blockquote>  Only you ideally know your product, target audience and the amount of money for advertising. <br><br>  Of course, this information can be provided to the agency, but <i>several more factors</i> need to be <i>taken into account.</i> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>"Pseudo-Individuality"</b> <br><br>  Specialists, when they set up an advertising campaign for your product, have other products and tasks that need to be solved, plus personal problems. <br>  <i>This greatly affects the result.</i> <br><br>  As a result, specialists spend the minimum amount of time when setting up advertising on the principle of a conveyor. <br><blockquote>  Number of customers = amount of money. </blockquote>  Everyone is talking about an individual approach to each client. <br><br>  But individuality is manifested in different texts and creatives, and no one does this in a well-thought-out strategy, testing the target audience, testing the placement and in-depth analysis of the market. <br><br>  <b>‚ÄúFinancial Responsibility‚Äù</b> <br><br>  Pay the agency the amount for the work done and plus the budget for advertising. <br><br>  Agency employees do not feel the line that you can feel when you spend money on testing and optimizing the advertising campaign.  Because it is not their hard-earned money and if you spend it, then nothing bad will happen. <br><br>  <i>For you as an entrepreneur, every money saved is a profit.</i> <br><br>  Even if you personally leaked money on advertising and were unable to achieve that result, you will at least get experience that will make you stronger in the future. <br><br>  It‚Äôs better to pay the money you pay for the services to the agency yourself in the advertising office. <br>  You will receive feedback from customers that will make you and your business even stronger. <br><br>  <b>"Conveyor"</b> <br><br>  As already written, the number of customers is equal to the amount of money.  In advertising agencies this is no exception. <br><br>  Only one team of specialists launches from 3 to 7 advertising campaigns per day, and this mixes up in the head, which ultimately affects the result. <br><br>  The employee is in a hurry and wants to complete the task faster in order to go home to rest and no one except you will not sit and think how to attract customers. <br><br>  There are many agencies on the market that devote a lot of time to the client and think out a strategy, but the check for their services is more than a dozen times. <br><br>  It's true guys.  To survive the agency, you need a certain amount per month.  Salaries, office rent, payment for services and much more. <br><br>  <b>Two ways to stay afloat for an agency:</b> <br><br>  <u>Take a lot of customers with a small check.</u> <br><br>  <u>Increase the average bill, but there will be much less customers.</u> <br><br>  Small businesses do not always have big money, and you get negative experience working with advertising agencies that you couldn‚Äôt get the result of, because you need to somehow survive and process more customers. <br><br>  <i>Advertising agencies are not effective, as it seems, but will set up an advertising campaign better than me?</i> <br><br>  <i>What then to do?</i> <br><br>  <b>Attract a</b> personal advertising specialist who will work in your business on an ongoing basis and bring customers. <br><br>  <b>Start understanding</b> advertising, trust me.  Personally, when I opened an agency with partners, I didn‚Äôt understand anything in advertising, I could only call and sell services and it turned out really bad, as a result, I figured it out and in the near future I could personally conduct a client and set up advertising. <br><blockquote>  The main thing is desire <br></blockquote>  When you begin to figure this out, you will have less chance of falling for the tricks of agencies that only take money from the business. <br><br>  <b>Summary</b> <br><br>  <i>Do not outsource advertising of your business if you are not good at it.</i> <br><br>  <i>Develop in advertising, it will not interfere with business.</i> <br><br>  <i>Now there are a huge number of courses and specialists who are ready to train from scratch.</i> <br><br>  PS I'm waiting for feedback.  Thank! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/461763/">https://habr.com/ru/post/461763/</a></p>
