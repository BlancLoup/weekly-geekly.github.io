The most interesting of them personally seemed to me the flagship ZTE Grand Era.  However, in the process of drawing after the presentation, I won not him, but ZTE V970, which I would like to report on the experience of using in this review. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/118/bd7/f6e/118bd7f6e4f797b88f32dc9566a139ca.jpg" alt="image">

      So, ZTE V970 is a strong middle peasant in the line of smartphones presented by ZTE.  It is based on a 2-core NVIDIA Tegra 2 processor, has a 4.3 dim display with a resolution of 960x540.  The truth is that the RAM is only 512 MB, which is for Android ICS, on which the device works.  Yes, and the built-in flash memory of 4 GB, but there is a slot for microSD, with which flash memory can be expanded by another 32 GB. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bed/c11/9d2/bedc119d23ea6b739d44f92a99c1726c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  However, the full characteristics of the smartphone <a href="">can be viewed on Yandex.Market</a> , so I will not dwell on them so much, and I will immediately turn to my experience of using this device. <br><br>  What I liked literally in the first hours of using the device was its ergonomic qualities.  The smartphone is beautifully assembled.  In the hand, it feels like a solid and self-sufficient object.  Due to the back cover of textured rubberized plastic - the device does not slide at all in the hands.  There are no even hints of any backlash and creaks.  Everything is fitted tightly, like stones in the megalithic masonry of the pyramids. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f85/8d4/cc8/f858d4cc828b10b98c7a4c86e0549df2.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The performance of the device does not cause any complaints.  Of course, I didn‚Äôt run super heavy games on it, but on the other hand, the smartphone is clearly not for them.  It is, rather, a business device from a little below the average price segment, and more precisely from the section up to 10 thousand rubles.  For all the daily tasks of its performance is quite enough.  No braking when receiving mail, messages, browsing (with normal Internet), I was not observed. <br><br><img src="http://i410.photobucket.com/albums/pp183/revazrezo/Screenshot_2012-10-12-04-43-53.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The video player plays files with a resolution of 720p, however, I would still advise not to use this resolution.  First, on the QHD display, you can‚Äôt see it, and secondly, the battery just looks at the eyes while watching such files.  I‚Äôll come back to the battery, but for now I‚Äôll say that in my experience, the optimal resolution of video files for viewing on ZTE V970 is 640x480. <br><br>  5 megapixel camera is quite suitable for use.  She shoots a widescreen video with a resolution of 720, she is able to photograph both with a 16: 9 aspect ratio and 4: 3. <br><br>  Here is a test video shot on the ZTE V970: <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/DikhPEV3Fpw%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhhsyV6KjqLNyBkZUTPW_NJY3FLKLQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Here are some examples of photos taken on a smartphone in various conditions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/fd9/00b/ca2/fd900bca27ff29756902baf62deecd3c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f5d/d54/bb7/f5dd54bb7f399c96bdd37869d09040fc.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e73/37a/9b8/e7337a9b878a36d6efea171dd4bdfc15.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c58/4fa/185/c584fa18595db2376c9610d1f1d47ece.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b87/bf5/f2f/b87bf5f2fa6ea8ef8b9f3f6718489775.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ec7/89f/90c/ec789f90c04a79b91a6a596a9b2f8e9a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/74b/31b/cb8/74b31bcb8fb85e2c51de6be24d37fbb5.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/175/a5c/f2e/175a5cf2e8568940f44de4c2adde9e94.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  If by themselves these photos cannot pretend to any artistry, then in the case of using an instagram, the camera will definitely fit and there will be no chance to distinguish it from the most flagship smartphones. <br><br>  There is no physical camera control button.  All control of the camera occurs only through the touch interface.  The settings do not stand out in principle, so it‚Äôs better to look at the screenshots than to describe them in words. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/64c/27a/df8/64c27adf8881cfac930c873bf402f10a.png" alt="image"><br><br>  And now I‚Äôll come back to the battery, the capacity of which seems to be quite adequate in current times: 1650 mAh.  However, by itself, capacity, especially in the case of smartphones on the android, by and large does not mean anything.  It all depends on the degree of optimization of software for a specific hardware.  Not to say that this optimization is bad here, but the fact that a smartphone is voracious is for sure.  The above capacity with active use is enough for 6 hours, when viewing video 640x480, - for 4-4.5 hours.  The situation in which the ZTE V970 would work for me without recharging throughout the day as the main and only smartphone - was not a single time.  But, if I had another device with me that I would use for the Internet, using ZTE only for calls and SMS, then the battery capacity lasted a day and a half.  However, it would be more correct to rely on recharging during the day. <br><br>  Now, as for the Android ICS itself, which is installed in the ZTE V970.  Formally, this is build 4.0.3, but the fact is that this is the so-called, naked, or pure android, without additional settings, which, in my subjective opinion, are rarely successful.  The only innovation on the part of ZTE in the interface concerns the lock screen.  And one more strange circumstance should be noted in this connection: on the smartphone case, not 3 touch buttons as it should for ICS, but 4, as required by the Android 2xxx version.  However, the user characteristics of the smartphone is not particularly affected.  Where notice that these buttons do not have the backlight. <br><br>  Well, in the end, the main drawback of this smartphone.  As it is not surprising, it concerns the display.  The resolution of the display can be misleading, because not only the resolution is a good display.  In this case, the TFT-matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãused, but the brightness of the display is so low that it doesn‚Äôt noticeably fade when it is in the sun, but with just daylight.  It is a pity, but apparently the use of cheap and not too high-quality display and led to such a democratic price for the device. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8ff/e8e/a05/8ffe8ea0534b9298c0d46b6df076d8c3.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Whatever it was, the smartphone still turned out to be quite acceptable, especially for its money: 7-10 thousand rubles. <br><br>  Video review of the ZTE V970 smartphone can be viewed here: <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/WBrFhdLsi4I%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhjI9oaRZ_c9uKUKUea0GEpFDya_Kg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/155559/">https://habr.com/ru/post/155559/</a></p>
