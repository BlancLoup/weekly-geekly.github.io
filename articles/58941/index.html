  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to advertise IM selling licensed games</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The moral of this post will be this: be placed where there are no your competitors. <br><br>  Imagine that you are the owner of an online store of multimedia discs: games, movies, music, and so on.  Imagine also that you start advertising in the game direction (more profitable than selling music discs).  Where will you advertise, besides the obvious sites: search, game forums, magazine publishing sites, game sites, price aggregators?  What non-obvious fruit for advertising? <br><br>  Vareznye sites, I will tell you.  And here's <a href="http://www.alive.org.ua/games/">an example</a> , I didn‚Äôt go far, especially since there are no advertisements on other versions of people in other cities.  I will tell you how to lure a customer.

      On the one hand, it‚Äôs silly to advertise on a site where games are offered for free.  BUT!  there is a very significant BUT. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The first ‚ÄúBUT‚Äù.  If the game was released quite recently, then the tablets (cracks) for the game are often very clumsy, difficult to install.  In short, download and install the game - hemorrhoid is still the same.  And so I want to play a new, long-awaited toy. <br><br>  The second ‚ÄúBUT‚Äù.  Favorite old toy, even with an already normal crack, can work very clumsily.  An illiterate translation and a bunch of other imperfections quacked game. <br><br>  The third ‚ÄúBUT‚Äù.  Cracks are those dangerous things that are not known what they do on your computer.  And let the antivirus is silent, but there is no 100% guarantee that by running crack.exe you didn‚Äôt get a ‚Äúmiracle‚Äù on your computer. <br><br>  As always, advertising is a manipulation.  Our business is to manipulate. <br><br>  Banners <br><br>  We work with the first ‚ÄúBUT‚Äù.  Advertising slogan: ‚ÄúHalf an hour hemorrhoids I crack?  Buy a license, install in 2 minutes, and the cost of one bar visit with friends. ‚Äù <br><br>  Thoughts gamers: ‚ÄúSix months waiting for a toy and stumble on to install it.  AAA !!!  damn, there is not enough evil.  Already ready for anything to finally start the game. ‚Äù <br><br>  Gamer runs back to the site, looking for an answer in the comments, which are usually full of similar questions.  And here is our banner!  Impulsiveness and emotions will play their own. <br><br>  We work as a ‚ÄúBUT‚Äù.  Poor translation, glitches of the game and so on.  strongly irritate.  Experienced gamers know this very well.  Therefore, your second banner: ‚ÄúPleasant gameplay is the result of high-quality translation.  Buy a license ‚Äùor something like that. <br><br>  We work with the third ‚ÄúBUT‚Äù.  ‚ÄúCrack can seriously damage your computer, buy clean licenses.‚Äù  Many players will not believe this, your task is to convince them of this.  A simple inscription under the game's announcement, such as: ‚Äúthe owners of the service do not bear responsibility for the consequences of downloading these files,‚Äù will also add fuel to the fire. <br><br>  It is important to remember that potential customers download the game, and depending on how well the installation was completed and the gameplay did not turn off, they go back to the same page. <br><br>  It means: <br><br>  1. Repeated contact may not happen.  Therefore, you may have to strike while it is hot.  Because of this, advertising slogans and information must respond to a one-time contact. <br><br>  2. The probability of returning to the same page is very high (I‚Äôve seen some gamers a little who installed everything the first time).  Here the advertising slogan will work better if you play on the arisen emotions of the gamer who returned after the failure. <br><br>  Alternative abnerm <br><br>  In addition to the banner in the right section there is another way to advertise.  Run affiliate program, offer owners Varez.  Guess your ideas for improving the conversion.  And to you reach the webmaster.  You will see how the buttons and references ‚Äúbuy for 300 rubles‚Äù will multiply next to the names of the games. <br><br>  World practice example <br><br>  Steve Cone, in his book, ‚ÄúSteal these ideas.  Marketing secrets that professionals would like to hide from you ‚Äùgave one interesting example. <br><br>  One engineering company that manufactures components and equipment has placed ads in the same place for many years. <br><br>  The advertising agency chose a certain newspaper (magazine) for the company, which covered their audience and advertised the client not in the pages of articles, reviews, among numerous competitors, but at the very end, where there was a crossword puzzle.  Advertisers of the company were guided by the idea that most engineers are diligent, meticulous people are fans of crosswords, and since competitors are not placed on such dubious pages, and solving a crossword puzzle is accompanied by a gliding eye over the whole page, there is a chance that most engineers will pay attention to advertising. <br><br>  As Steve says, the company was advertised in this way for many years - so the result was. <br><br>  PS Another article written using the ‚Äúinverted peremaine‚Äù technique.  What do you say?  That's better? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/58941/">https://habr.com/ru/post/58941/</a></p>
