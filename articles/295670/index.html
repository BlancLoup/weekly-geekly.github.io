Indeed, modern team building is mainly used for organizing a crowd, which, in turn, does not want to organize.

      What are the consequences?  The consequences are devastating. <a name="habracut"></a><br>  Instead of uniting the team with a common idea, there is a unification with a common hatred for the event.  As a result, the team remains scattered during work and functions smoothly when this ‚ÄúT # @ # $% NG‚Äù begins.  There is no increase in efficiency.  This method works only in the case of selling vacuum cleaners at home.  There is a zombie sellers for the subsequent zombie buyers.  A kind of zombie apocalypse, but instead of shotguns - vacuum cleaners. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">How to sell vacuum cleaners</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  In the morning, sellers are taken to the place by bus.  The whole trip is played merry music.  To this are added command hymns, to raise the morale of the seller (produkh).  Coordinators thus charge the crowd to sell the hidden "* rbi".  Further, upon arrival, the ‚Äúzombies‚Äù are parachuted from the transport and, in the literal sense, scatter into homes / apartments / cottages.  And infect everyone in their path.  Yes, of course, the goal has been achieved - sales are going, ‚Äúrunners‚Äù are charged with optimism, buyers are struggling to fight back.  From the point of view of the leader of this gang - everything is gorgeous.  But the ‚Äúrunners‚Äù do not think, do not solve problems, they do nothing but run and play the text recorded in the brain.  Here it is - team building in all its glory. <br></div></div><br>  In a team that must create, invent, create, etc.  Such methods do not work, you can only destroy the full potential and ruin even existing projects.  Each member of the creative team, be it a developer, designer, advertiser, or architect, is unique.  Each member of the team ponders, experiences, or animates some idea.  It is very important to create the right atmosphere for creating a ‚Äúfarm of ideas‚Äù. <br><br>  How are ideas born?  Of course, the birth of thought is an intimate moment.  We will not talk about the work of the brain or the influence of the soul - no.  We will talk about the conditions around us, which contribute to the emergence of unique (and not so) solutions. <br><br>  * KEA - the evolution of the furniture market.  It's simple - Ingvar Kamprad could not put a table in his car and took off his legs.  Voila!  There is an idea - there is * kea! <br><br>  It is important to create a ‚Äúsoil‚Äù on which the project will grow.  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating Ridewithme came to us exactly like this. <br><br>  <i>Once, in the icy winter season, I left the house - and there was nobody to go with.</i>  Quote from our <a href="http://appleinsider.ru/from-readers/dev-story-novyj-vitok-razvitiya-lyubitelskogo-sporta-v-rossii-korotko-ridewithme.html">Developer story on Appleinsider.ru</a> <br><br>  All ideas in your team should be discussed over tea with cookies or something else.  It is at these moments that you are not burdened by stress due to the deadline, the xCode update buggy, the long rendering of the picture and other working moments.  Your head is free for new thoughts.  Listen to everyone, think about the thought even if it is idiotic.  Why?  - you ask.  Because, perhaps, there is a development in this thought, perhaps, by discussing this particular idea, you can make the perfect decision.  Yes, this method is fundamentally different from charging the entire office or corporate party, but it is this that allows all the creativity inside you to go outside.  This can be called a brainstorm, passing in a comfortable environment. <br><br>  <i>Brainstorming is an operational method of solving a problem on the basis of stimulating creative activity, in which participants in the discussion are encouraged to express as many solutions as possible, including the most fantastic ones.</i>  Material from wikipedia. <br><br>  Here, too, has its own nuances, the brain storm in our team is a very broad concept.  If one large department participates in large companies in a brainstorming session, then naturally we don‚Äôt have one.  First, we have no department.  Secondly, the department often works on one specific task, and no matter how many parts this task consists of, the goal is one: unleash, develop, assemble, disassemble, etc. Since all have one goal, the department gradually synchronizes and everyone starts to think the same way, and the sense of the brain storm is lost.  One person from this department is just as capable of making an emergency decision.  Solution found - good!  Is this a rational decision?  Time will tell.  Friends and relatives also take part in our battles - anyone can offer their own vision.  Of course, the grandmother will not be able to advise how to raise the fallen server, but in terms of the design of the application, the grandmother is one of the best tools to optimize and simplify the interface. <br><br>  At the end of the article, I would like to note that these methods work for us.  Perhaps in your team you decide to use something of your own - special, suitable for your designer Petya and programmer Sasha.  And it will be great!  Because this is exactly the way a team is formed, each of you is unique!  And do not fool everyone with kebabs and choral singing. <br><br>  All the results of the brain storms on the part of the design you can see in <a href="http://megamozg.ru/company/ridewithme/blog/20248/">this article.</a> <br>  Our application is <a href="">available in the AppStore.</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/295670/">https://habr.com/ru/post/295670/</a></p>
