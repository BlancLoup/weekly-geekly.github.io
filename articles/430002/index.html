      Creating Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 Beta, we have seriously worked to make it a universal basis for traditional computing environments and innovative IT infrastructures.  The new generation of our corporate Linux platform is designed to help implement digital transformation strategies in hybrid cloud environments that enable organizations to efficiently use Linux containers, Kubernetes and other technical innovations to bring unique products and services to market.  At the same time, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 Beta will help IT professionals optimize and improve the efficiency of existing IT systems, as well as ensure stability and productivity in the implementation of innovations. <br><br>  In the four years that have passed since the <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/about/press-releases/red-hat-unveils-red-hat-enterprise-linux-7-redefining-enterprise-operating-system">release of our</a> Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 OS, the world of IT technology has changed a lot - we are with it.  Today, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 Beta once again sets a new operating system standard as the foundation for IT innovation.  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 Beta has received hundreds of enhancements and dozens of new features, including those that allow you to effectively use this platform for digital transformation and transition to hybrid cloud computing technologies, without sacrificing the stability of existing IT systems. <br><br>  <b>Oops!</b>  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 Beta introduces the <b>Application Streams</b> application flow concept, which allows userspace packages to be delivered more easily and flexibly.  The userspace components can now be updated more often than the main OS packages, i.e.  This can be done without waiting for the release of a new version of the operating system.  It also becomes possible to install different versions of the same package, for example, a programming language or a DBMS, which increases the flexibility of customizing and customizing Red Hat Enterprise Linux while maintaining the overall stability and reliability of the platform. <br><br>  Moving on, in addition to the updated kernel architecture, other major improvements and innovations have appeared in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 Beta. <br><br><h3>  Network </h3><br>  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 Beta supports <b>IPVLAN</b> and allows containers on virtual machines to communicate with network hosts with minimal overhead and network latency.  <b>The new TCP / IP stack with the bandwidth and round-trip propagation time (BBR) overload tracking engine</b> improves performance, minimizes delays and reduces packet losses when streaming video broadcasting, cloud storage and other similar Internet services. <br><br><h3>  Security </h3><br>  Continuing the tradition of previous versions, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 Beta offers enhanced code, regular security fixes, and its extensive experience in creating secure software.  One of our main goals with the release of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 is to increase the security of hybrid cloud environments by providing a secure default operating system. <br><br>  With support for <b>OpenSSL 1.1.1 and TLS 1.3</b> , server applications on the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 Beta platform can now apply the latest standards to protect data.  <b>System-wide Cryptographic Policies system-wide</b> cryptographic policies simplify compliance with regulations and data protection requirements, allowing them to be implemented centrally rather than by setting up or refining individual applications. <br><br><h3>  Linux containers </h3><br>  We built Linux container support into Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7, and today containers are one of the most important components of the notorious digital transformation, paving the way for all these more portable and flexible enterprise applications. <br><br>  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 Beta fully supports and includes the lightweight and open standards-based Red Hat Container <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/daemon-haunted-container-world-no-longer-introducing-buildah-10"><b>Toolkit</b></a> , which includes tools such as <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/daemon-haunted-container-world-no-longer-introducing-buildah-10"><b>Buildah</b></a> (container <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/articles/podman-next-generation-linux-container-tools/"><b>building</b></a> ), <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/articles/podman-next-generation-linux-container-tools/"><b>Podman</b></a> (launching containers) and <a href="https://blog.openshift.com/promoting-container-images-between-registries-with-skopeo/"><b>Skopeo</b></a> (searching and sharing). use of containers).  Thanks to the distributed architecture and the abandonment of daemonless programs, these tools help developers search, launch, assemble and exchange containers faster and more efficiently. <br><br><h3>  System management </h3><br>  With the increasing role of Linux in corporate data centers, there is an increasing need for simpler and more accessible management tools that help system novice administrators to work effectively with hybrid environments and perform other tasks unaccustomed to themselves.  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 Beta is designed to simplify the life of an administrator of any skill level, primarily through the unified management console of the Red Hat Enterprise Linux Web Console, whose simple and intuitive interface allows you to efficiently manage Red Hat Enterprise Linux servers in local and remote mode. including virtual machines. <br><br>  The <b>Composer</b> tool will help both novice and experienced users of Red Hat Enterprise Linux create and deploy OS images in a hybrid cloud, including in physical and virtualized environments, private and public clouds.  Composer's simple and intuitive graphical interface simplifies access to packages and builds deployable images, helping you quickly and easily configure Red Hat Enterprise Linux to meet specific needs, be it minimizing image size or creating customized configuration, and also the target deployment environment, including virtual machines and cloud computing. environment. <br><br>  <b>Yum 4</b> , the new version of the staffed Red Hat Enterprise Linux package manager, offers more performance, less dependencies during installation, and more choices when working with package versions. <br><br><h3>  File Systems and Data Stores </h3><br>  Another new <b>feature of</b> Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 Beta is <b>Stratis</b> , a volume-oriented file system.  Stratis allows the administrator to abstract from the technical details of the implementation of the storage through the use of APIs and quickly create easy-to-manage and efficient file systems. <br><br>  Snapshots of the <b>File System Snapshots</b> file system significantly speed up file-level tasks, such as cloning virtual machines, and also help save disk space by writing to the storage only when data changes.  <b>LUKSv2 support</b> for encrypting data on a disk in combination with Network-Bound Disk Encryption (NBDE) improves security and simplifies access to encrypted data. <br><br><h3>  The future is ready for testing. </h3><br>  In this article, we didn‚Äôt just want to explain why Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 Beta is the foundation of the corporate IT systems of the future.  We really want you to meet her in person.  We invite all of our customers to start <a href="https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-enterprise-linux/beta">testing Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 Beta</a> and, in practice, evaluate its capabilities in terms of increasing flexibility, reliability and manageability when deploying applications.  As for software developers, they too can see the future of the leading enterprise-class Linux platform using the <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/rhel8">Red Hat Developer Program</a> . <br><br>  Well, if you are not familiar with Red Hat Enterprise Linux, go here <a href="https://downloads.redhat.com/redhat/rhel/rhel-8-beta">Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 Public Beta</a> , see the README file for instructions and get started. <br><br>  <i>Stefanie Chiras, <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/powering-its-future-while-preserving-present-introducing-red-hat-enterprise-linux-8-beta">English</a></i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/430002/">https://habr.com/ru/post/430002/</a></p>
