  <section class="page js-page"><h1>A list of ten most failed technology projects has been compiled.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  CNET News has published a list of the ten most unsuccessful projects in the field of information technology and technology, many of which failed miserably for one reason or another. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  First of all, the compilers of the hit parade of unfulfilled hopes are called the Sinclair C5 electric carriage, created by Clivos Sinclair in the 80s of the last century.  A three-wheeled battery-powered Sinclair C5 was positioned as an inexpensive vehicle that could be operated without a driver's license.  For all the time, about 15,000 electric wheelchairs were sold, but Sinclair‚Äôs company went bankrupt. <br><br>  Following the Sinclair C5, Barcode Battler, a portable gaming console released in 1991, is on the list of failed projects.  Due to poor graphics and poor sound quality, it was almost impossible to play on the device.  Next on the charts is the Squircle handheld player with extremely limited functionality.  This device didn't even have built-in memory, and the developers suggested storing MP3 compositions on removable SD / MMC flash cards. <br><br>  The list also includes another pocket game console - Gizmondo, which went on sale in early 2005.  This device has not gained popularity due to extremely low-quality games.  From a terrible project from the technical point of view, the authors of the rating attributed the Tamagotchi gaming device.  Despite the fact that these electronic gadgets were in great demand, according to the compilers of the list, they are too intrusive and annoying the owner.

      The hit parade of unsuccessful projects also includes an Apple Puck Mouse in the form of a washer, which was not very convenient to work with, and the Atari Jaguar gaming console.  Amstrad Em @ iler Telephone, which allowed sending e-mail without using a computer, did not find any market distribution either. <br><br>  According to the compilers of the list, one of the unsuccessful projects should include the scandalous story about the First 4 Internet XCP copy restriction technology used by Sony BMG record label on some compact discs.  As it turned out, DRM-tools not only limited the ability to copy music from disks, but also hid very cleverly on the computer, so removing them for the average user was not possible. <br><br>  Finally, a new Microsoft Windows Vista operating system is included in the charts.  The compilers of the rating believe that the product for which the downgrade option is offered to the previous version can hardly be called successful. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/16894/">https://habr.com/ru/post/16894/</a></p>
