Attitudes toward Tesla developed from a consumer view of the product into an ideology and political position.  Tesla is discussed with the words "I believe, I do not believe."  Opinion about her immediately linked with views on life.  If you say to a stranger ‚ÄúI believe in Tesla,‚Äù he will immediately understand what I think about Trump and Putin, and what kind of smoothie I like the most. <br><br>  All this is very, very strange.  After all, we are just talking about the car, which is a bit unusual under the hood.

      We <a href="https://habr.com/ru/users/baragol/" class="user_link">baragol</a> wanted to talk about Tesla so that once and for all.  Therefore, we went to people who know about her best in Russia - the guys from the Moscow Tesla Club. <br><br>  They opened more than five years ago, and during this time almost all Tesla who travel on our roads got into Russia through them.  They are on a short leg with engineers from California and once nearly opened Tesla's official service in Moscow.  But they limited themselves to just the title of ‚ÄúClub‚Äù - it‚Äôs like not a dealer, and not a service, and not a store, but, yes, like. <br><br>  We tried to touch on all the controversial, controversial and acute moments, but in preparing this material I did not get the feeling that the concentration of the love of our interlocutor for Tesla, skeptical readers, would simply be nauseous with electricity.  Therefore, if the word "Mask" somewhere inside you is ripening, "how did you get those ...", it‚Äôs better to read <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/448088/">how plasma engines are made in Kaliningrad</a> . <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><hr><br>  Igor Antarov ( <a href="https://habr.com/ru/users/antares19/" class="user_link">Antares19</a> ), the owner of Model S, the managing partner of the club and the business partner of Alexey Yeremchuk, with whom they develop the club, talked with and drank a smoothie.  Igor is a former programmer.  He developed more for the ZX Spectrum, and read the entire instruction for the Palm OS API from the screen 160 by 160 pixels for the sake of entertainment.  Next - his monologues on controversial topics from our many hours of conversation. <br><br><h2>  Electric cars are not needed in Russia </h2><br>  We are a logistics company by one third - we help to purchase and deliver vehicles.  On the other - the owners club.  And the third part - we are engaged in the popularization of cars, which, in my opinion, is the biggest problem.  People in Russia did not even see electric vehicles live, but they believe in all rumors and stories.  Need to talk about real exploitation.  Fighting myths is a big deal. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xx/qx/w_/xxqxw_5hdrodxjwt0hehybk61r4.jpeg"><br><br>  In my estimation, there are about three hundred and fifty Tesla cars in Russia.  Most of them are in St. Petersburg and Moscow.  In general, there are about 3,700 electric vehicles in the country, and the leader in terms of their number is the Far East.  People see that the second-hand right-hand drive Nissan Leaf costs 500 thousand rubles, they consider the cost of electricity, and they understand that it makes no sense to drive on gasoline.  True, in Moscow a good left-handed Leaf with mileage is twice as expensive.  At the same time, mileage does not affect the electric car in the same way as a gasoline one.  Rings in cylinders do not wear out, oil does not flow.  They look only at the body and the battery. <br><br>  New Tesla goes to Russia through us two to four months.  The car is collected at the factory, it floats by ship to Europe, is completed and goes to Russia.  For Tesla, it is important that all the cars that we imported quickly acquired the owners.  And they are calm when each order is registered for a specific person.  Tesla does not hold warehouses, it produces under the order. <br><br>  But it happens that a person comes and says: ‚ÄúI need a car as a gift tomorrow.  Necessarily red, with white salon. ‚Äù  Although black and gray is in the cabin and sold - we always have a few cars that can be purchased in one day.  But Tesla has intermediate warehouses, for example, with non-purchased machines.  We can find urgent orders there, and Tesla is ready to give them to us. <br><br>  Five years ago, everything was chaotic and unofficial.  Now we are working through a clear channel, Tesla knows about us.  There were even cases when a person in Europe wanted to buy a car in Russia, and there he was offered to contact us. <br><br><h2>  Tesla is not customs cleared, there will be a confusion with horsepower </h2><br>  Oddly enough, our car turns out more expensive, although the economy is weaker.  Buyers do not like such a large margin.  They say: ‚ÄúWe see the price there, why is there so much?‚Äù That is the reality, you will not do anything. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/nd/hc/nz/ndhcnzs8jtfprp8vucmqyrftafg.jpeg"><br><br>  The lion's share of the price is customs duty.  Then there are added, insurance, delivery, registration of Russian documents.  The chain is very big.  To clear the car properly, you have to go through a complicated algorithm.  For each car, one has to receive a SBKTS certificate, since the manufacturer did not deal with certification in Russia. <br><br>  Tax is taken in view of horsepower.  The customs officer will not miss his profit.  He will take kilowatts and, according to his cunning sign, will count him in a "horse."  But what he writes does not correspond to reality.  Tesla has two engines - front and rear.  How to count?  Add their maximum power?  They work nonlinearly.  Need to count on the power of the motor?  Or how much energy is ready to give the battery specifically on this model?  The whole chain of questions begins.  Tesla used to write how many horses they have, then they simply removed their references from everywhere.  The only clear characteristic is the acceleration time.  The car goes 2.7 to hundreds - everything is clear, it can be measured.  And how many horses there are is not clear. <br><br>  But we fight, we try to lobby.  I am a member of expert groups under the government, we are writing petitions for the governors to abolish the vehicle tax for electric vehicles, and there is already progress.  Even if the Nissan Leaf will be cheaper, people will buy, ride, and infrastructure will begin to develop. <br><br>  For us, this is a huge burden, I would not do it at all and would have earned more, easier and faster in the IT world.  But you have to do it. <br><br><h2>  Mercedes, Porsche and Audi will crush Tesla with one left </h2><br>  Electric cars are a technology that will grow exponentially.  At first it is expensive and not enough, then there will be an explosion, as with smartphones.  Every child has a smartphone now.  The explosion will come in any case, it is inevitable.  You can even do nothing, but the big difference is how long it will happen - in five, ten years.  Or a year later.  The term affects every action. <br><br>  I think that in five years, dramatic changes will come even in Russia.  Even in 2019, a number of car manufacturers will produce electric cars.  Mercedes, Audi, Porsche launch their electric cars. <br><br>  But before Tesla still digging and digging.  This is a very sensitive question, and maybe I will hurt someone.  Older manufacturers have a lot of car manufacturing experience, they know how cool it is to make the interior soft, comfortable, with neat lines.  But Tesla does not know, and everyone complains about it, what's inside is not like in a German car. <br><br>  Older manufacturers say - we have a loyal base.  Now we will make an electric car, and we will easily get our market share.  But even their forward moves are conservative.  They see what Tesla is now, and they want to make it look like.  But a year later, Tesla will take another ten steps forward. <br><br>  Any auto brand is trying to sit on two chairs.  Petrol cars are sold here and now.  This is a huge production - boxes, motors, oil.  The money is invested in machines, in production technology, in services.  Dealers earn on the maintenance of boxes and motors.  It is not profitable for anyone to take and stop the car that brings money. <br><br>  When the manufacturer launches a cool electric car, which bypasses the characteristics of their own gasoline, the production of gasoline can be minimized.  And in this lot of money invested.  It is necessary that the machine for ten billion as long as possible worked and brought money to pay off four times. <br><br><h2>  Better hybrids than full electric cars </h2><br>  What hybrids!  Gasoline is evil, and hybrids are even worse.  If the electric car is radically simpler, everything unnecessary is thrown out there, there are no three hundred parts that work under a heavy load, then in the hybrid we complicate everything.  We shove a battery with wires into the petrol system.  She is small, she sits down quickly and you carry those extra pounds on gasoline.  This may be good as a psychological transitional moment, but engineering is very bad. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/e3/3c/c-/e33cc-vexeqmohmout96rsoshvs.jpeg"><br><br><h2>  Petrol lobby will not let Tesla fly </h2><br>  In fact, Tesla does not interfere with the petrol lobby, and the dealership.  Now Tesla has no dealers, only direct sales.  If they had agreed to the dealer model, large holdings would have come to them and forced them to sell electric cars along with ordinary cars. <br><br>  Musk thinks it won't work.  On-site gasoline dealers are not interested in selling electric cars.  The first reason is that the dealer earns money from the service, but you cannot earn money from Tesla's service.  The second reason is that managers who sell cars should be retrained.  They need to spend four times more time to explain about kilowatts, to tell how she goes in the winter, what to do with sockets, how to set up a station, what if you get unloaded on the way.  A manager who lives on sales premiums could sell four petrol cars for the same time.  Therefore, he does not have the motivation to talk about the electric car, and he will say: "This is complex nonsense, let's go, I will show a simple normal car." <br><br>  Petrol dealers who sell electric cars provide terrible service to customers.  Machines are discharged, dusty, somewhere in the corner, no one is engaged in them.  Buyers themselves come more prepared than managers - and this is even in California.  With that, there is a charge on each parking lot. <br><br>  Therefore, Tesla retail does not want to mix itself with gasoline machines.  Her retail was built by George Blankenship - the same person who figured out how to sell iPhones.  They began to open in shopping centers.  There is a demonstration machine and managers just tell and show, but do not sell.  Sales are online only. <br><br>  Dealer enclaves in America are trying to take Tesla.  In the States, dealers are huge structures.  They have their own senators, they are closely associated with the government, because lobbying is legal.  In some States, laws have been passed under which the manufacturer cannot sell cars past dealers. <br><br>  The law was passed a hundred years ago, when powerful factory corporations did not give life to small businesses.  Now everything has turned upside down: now dealers are huge corporations.  The strongest clashes in the courts of Tesla occur in Texas, where they still can not open their store.  My friend in Texas was carried Tesla from a neighboring state. <br><br>  If, in this confrontation in the USA, Tesla opens a dealership, for example, in Russia, in America they will be told: ‚ÄúHow are you not working according to the dealer model?  But in Russia. "  Therefore, it is important for them that we do not purchase warehouses and do not work according to the dealer model.  We just fit in the spirit.  Electric cars must sell fans, people who drive themselves. <br><br><h2>  Tesla is just a scam for the sake of shares, and it will collapse at any moment. </h2><br>  I think, until no one beat Mask.  Even in history, when he was removed from his post as chairman of the council. <br><br>  That was after the tweets "I will buy Tesla shares at 420" and "420 - because my girlfriend liked the number."  Then he wrote "funding confirmed."  According to people who are engaged in the global financial markets, Musk has no right to write such on Twitter, because it is a market manipulation.  The court decided that he was leaving the post, hiring two more directors who should control everything.  And he recently wrote that it was worth it.  That's why. <br><br>  The official story is this - he tried to find out whether he could buy the company, asked for advice from the shareholders, he was not told, and he changed his mind. <br><br>  In fact, he did it, because Tesla is a very volatile company, stocks jump from any infopowder.  It is very easy to make the trend go up or down.  And many play short, put millions of dollars down against Tesla and order information campaigns for stocks to plummet.  There are a number of major American media outlets that are occasionally bombed with articles that something is wrong with Tesla.  Shares go down and they earn. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/yx/ty/w9/yxtyw9lm7pltjuijxvsi-u_vcnw.jpeg"><br><br>  Musk said - "Do not short Tesla.  I'm trying to translate humanity into electric cars, and you are interfering, just making money on promotions. ‚Äù  I wrote and it did not work.  And when he wrote that he would buy shares at 420, he burned down the positions of the shorts worth billions.  At the moment when they were waiting for the fall, the shares went up, and their positions closed.  A bunch of people came out with losses.  It was a very hard lesson for those who shorted.  Musk paid twenty million of his money for a fine, and another twenty from the company.  But he burned billions from people who played against Tesla and interfered. <br><br>  After that, the quarter passed, Tesla showed the first profit, and all that he lost was immediately returned.  And the fact that he was removed from his post - he himself asked to be officially appointed ‚ÄúNobody in Tesla‚Äù.  But on Twitter, he was persuaded to leave at least the position of senior engineer. <br><br>  Whatever happens to stocks, Tesla always has the basic technology.  They have the best batteries on the market, they are engaged in them for ten years.  Modules, cooling, chemistry are different from everything that others have. <br><br>  The autopilot used to be done by a third-party company, but Tesla began to demand a lot, they put forward demands in response, and Musk said: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre doing it from scratch‚Äù.  He tweeted that he was looking for people in the autopilot team with reports to him personally.  Less than a year later, the autopilot 2.0 was released on Nvidia processors.  Now Tesla finishes its chip, which will be a thousand percent faster. <br><br>  They own the basic technology, which is super valuable in itself. <br><br><h2>  And where does your electricity come from?  If from coal, then electric cars are also dirty vehicles. </h2><br>  Even if you burn coal, electric car is still cleaner.  Electricity that gets into the motor has a very high efficiency throughout the chain - 90-95%.  Efficiency gasoline engine - 30% or below.  Of the one thousand rubles that we pay for gasoline, seven hundred go to heating the street.  And while still creating a harmful exhaust.  Plus, gasoline must be transported to gasoline tank trucks.  It must be mined, and the prey is very dirty.  I am sure that in 80% of cases we are ill because health is ruined by exhausts. <br><br>  Electricity is an alternative that can be mined with coal, it is possible by gas, which is much cleaner, by atom, wind, and sun.  We need a tiny piece of desert to provide everyone with energy.  And with gasoline, there is no choice. <br><br>  When I introduced the IT system in Khanty-Mansiysk, they told me how the pipelines flow.  Nature is suffering in places of leakage, but people are guarded by pipelines with machine guns, and no one will see. <br><br>  Even if we assume an absurd situation that the extraction of electricity is as dirty as the production of gasoline, I have a simple question - who wants to put a gasoline car in his bedroom, start and leave for an hour?  This is wild.  But walking in the butt of thousands of cars on the street seems normal.  We just got used to the hundred years that this is normal.  If our coffee makers had been working on gasoline for a hundred years, we would also get used to it. <br><br><h2>  Battery recycling will kill the environment even more. </h2><br>  Now they do not know how to dispose of batteries on a large scale.  Power is not enough even for the number of machines that are being produced at the moment. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/cc/he/hb/cchehbnwci2n6xu_rjqner04gyu.jpeg"><br><br>  But car and battery manufacturers are interested in their disposal.  The amount of lithium in the world is limited, and if it is not reused, it will end faster than all the machines will become electric.  That is, it is profitable for producers to develop recycling - they do not have to be forced.  Just now it does not have enough power. <br><br>  But there is still time for development.  Tesla battery warranty - eight years.  When a battery becomes unsuitable for a car, Tesla uses it in other projects ‚Äî for example, in home batteries.  She can work there for another fifteen years. <br><br>  In total, it turns out more than twenty years.  This is not a bad stock to develop a cool recycling technology. <br><br><h2>  They write that in Tesla terrible working conditions </h2><br>  I have been to Tesla headquarters several times, and usually there is no way to go further than the reception there.  You can still access the factory in Fremont where cars are stamped.  If you are the owner, you can even bring a friend.  But I managed to get there, with a guest badge, officially.  We were led by one of the top engineers at the request of another famous person in the Valley. <br><br>  When I saw how R &amp; D looks from the inside, I realized that Tesla is doing well.  You know, in the films they show how scientists work - you can shoot it in reality there. <br><br>  A whole floor, a large open space, where work really boils.  Everything is very tightly packed, sit, code, discuss.  A huge crowd of people plowing from call to call.  And they recruit the best engineers, because everyone wants to work there.  And this is just R &amp; D.  They are working on what will be released in five years.  In the same openspace - the table at Ilon, next to a huge window.  He constantly travels by plane between SpaceX and Tesla and works at least twice a week with the team. <br><br>  You go down to the floor below - there are already people with soldering irons.  There are test load installations, supercharger batteries.  This is a crazy human potential, a crazy technological base.  No automaker even does this close. <br><br><h2>  Tesla does not have enough power to produce machines in large quantities. </h2><br>  I was at almost all Tesla factories.  It was at the opening of the Gigafactory in Nevada - the largest plant in the world.  By area, more than just the auction of flowers in the Netherlands, and in terms of volume - the Boeing plant.  But when the factory is completed completely, it will bypass all.  By reaching full power, it will make as many batteries as the whole world had taken together. <br><br>  Among the owners of Tesla played out tickets for the opening, and I managed to win.  There were several thousand people there, but in the hall it seemed there were only a couple hundred of them. <br><br>  A plant worth five billion dollars is a lot of money.  Huge investments, the most large-scale construction among startups, involved tens of thousands of people.  And it seemed to me that if everything worked out, then Tesla can be trusted. <br><br>  And here I come to the presentation.  Around the desert, Martian landscapes, red mountains around, and this building is being built in the valley.  It looks incredibly technological - modular, safe-seismic, stands on platforms, robots ride inside. <br><br>  When the presentation begins, Ilon takes the stage.  He is met as a rock star. He says: Tesla has become more of an energy company than an automobile.  We run Gigafactory One.  And I understand that my scale of thinking will not work - it is far from its scale.  I was looking at this plant, and he was already planning the next two. <br><br>  For him, this is all a small step.  Tesla is a stepping stone to a big goal.  I then had a simple tectonic shift.  The main idea is to make humanity a multi-planetary civilization.  All his projects are in one box.  Electric cars - on Mars you must somehow go without gasoline.  Cheap rockets, solar panels, boring machines, because on Mars it will be necessary to dig a lot.  His brother Kimball creates vertical gardens, autonomous hydroponic containers that grow food in a fully closed cycle.  All projects add up to one goal. <br><br>  And she is not here, but there.  Tesla needs a Mask only to grow technology. <br><br><h2>  In Russia, the production of electric cars is impossible </h2><br>  Now is the best time to build factories for the production of electric vehicles and batteries, factories for the disposal of batteries.  This is future oil, and now you can get ready.  While it is technologically easier to make them than gasoline engines, but in five years it will be hard. <br><br>  Electric transport is developing exponentially, and if support measures are not taken now (at least to attract foreign cars) so that the infrastructure is built, we will find ourselves in a situation where Norway, Germany and India stop registering gasoline cars, manufacturers stop producing them, and used cars that no one needs merge to us. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vy/p3/ad/vyp3adxdcp21u5l6d_-_uha41ga.jpeg"><br><br>  Let him finish that IL - it's better than nothing.  Appearance is unimportant, the main thing is to put there a real battery, which is produced here. <br><br><h2>  Tesla will not stand the Russian winter </h2><br>  The first Tesla Model S, which was in Russia, was in Barnaul.  In winter there is -40.  On YouTube, there is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DEMJc_GawVhU">video of the</a> owner, where he is quite happy in the cold. <br><br>  If the petrol car is left for 4 hours in such cold weather, it should be wrapped with blankets, and then wound up with a blowtorch.  Tesla in the cold and in the heat of the same start, because the battery is always heated by itself - everything inside is surrounded by heat pipes.  It cools down, but not to the extent that chemistry begins to deteriorate and capacity is lost. <br><br>  Certainly, the battery loses energy from heating, the car sucks up electricity just by standing.  But in the most severe Moscow winter I lose a maximum of 30% of the run.  I don't care if I charge it in five days or four.  In Barnaul, I think, heating the battery will eat 50 percent.  Instead of conditionally 400 kilometers, it will travel on a single charge of 200. <br><br>  Once I had a half-charged Tesla for a week standing under the snow.  I excavated it, and there are 10 kilometers left.  And having stood for three hours in the cold, you do not need to warm anything - I sat down and went.  Warm air blows immediately, because it comes not from the engine, which is not known when it heats up, but immediately from electricity. <br><blockquote><h2>  Impressions of Tesla from Ivan Zvyagin ( <a href="https://habr.com/ru/users/baragol/" class="user_link">baragol</a> ) </h2><br>  Tesla is more a gadget than a car.  I have already spoken about this many times and removed a bunch of vidos, but I will still share my impressions of the three models in which I was sitting.  The fact that almost everything lends itself to adjustment from the display is understandable and generally not surprising.  You can put the servos in any car.  But most of all I was torn from the fact that you can create scripts. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://coub.com/embed/1tahf7" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Near the garage, the car itself can fold mirrors, in the zone of speed bumps will lift the suspension, and depending on who sits behind the wheel, selects the profile and sets the seats and steering wheel to the desired position.  And sensor-sensors-sensors.  On top models, the doors open automatically and, in order not to hurt anyone or tear off the paint, the door will not open itself if there is not enough side space.  The Model X will also not flip the rear doors fully up if it sees that the ceiling is too close. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://coub.com/embed/1tahm4" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://coub.com/embed/1tahu7" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Power and responsiveness can also be customized - as the recoil force of the vibration motor in smartphones.  In the most relaxed mode, the car behaves like a family car, accelerating gently and even slowly.  But I would not advise Ludicrous mode to choose those who are driving recently.  Once a professional racer showed me what Lamborghini Murcielago is capable of on a racetrack.  So the Model S in the "funny" mode behaves about the same.  In the seat not only presses, but throws with all the dope, and, not being ready, for the first time I managed to say only ‚Äúyour mother!‚Äù.

There is nothing at all except the steering wheel and the display, even the deflectors of the climate system - they are also on servo drives and hidden in a wide slot.

And how much gas is left? ,   ,        . ,       ‚Äî,        ,       90-   .   , , .   :    ,       ,        ? <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://coub.com/embed/1taho1" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></blockquote><br><h2>     ,     </h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There is the concept of Range Anxiety - anxiety that you will not reach. It appeared when electric cars drove a maximum of one hundred kilometers. You ride them and watch the battery melt. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Tesla's breakthrough is that this alarm is absent. Previously, the charge was shown on the monitor large and in the middle, then a small icon was stuck somewhere in the corner, which I really don‚Äôt have to look at. I know that I absolutely always have enough charge to get where I need to. Travel is a separate issue, you need to know in advance where you will charge. But in the city, whatever I do, I can not put the car. For four and a half years, I planted it only once. Specially.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It was in the winter, just as the week was freezing cold ‚Äì30 she had a charge of 10 km left. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I could drive to the backyard to the outlet, could agree with any store or car wash, connect to any outlet in 220V. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But I wondered how much the car really would stretch. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I set the path to charging in the office in the center of a private house and went, although according to calculations there was no chance. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I just landed slide. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">On the rise, it was necessary to slow down, and I drove normally. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">As a result, the lift did not have enough power, and the car began to persuade to park. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">After that, I drove another three hundred meters, parked, and she began to gradually turn off.</font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/cm/vt/rv/cmvtrvpigwqy0sfebu7ehzvlw-g.jpeg"><br><br><h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Why wait for charging when you can fill up the gas and go </font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This is also an old concept that has taken root in a hundred years. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the new paradigm, fuel should not be poured in principle. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The car is charging while it is stored. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The owners of Tesla do not need any urban infrastructure at all. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A car that drives four hundred kilometers, charges at home or at work ‚Äî you only need to make an effort once, solve the problem with the main charging station and never go to any gas station in your life. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I personally have already lost the habit, it is strange for me to be there. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This is some kind of greetings from the past, like horses at the crossing to change.</font></font><br><br><h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> If Tesla breaks - you fucking repair it </font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I do not know what to do with Tesla to break it. Recently there was a test Model 3 with a run of a million miles. Motor after parsing looked like new. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In a gasoline car, the fuel ignites, pushes the cylinder, it moves vertically, then it must be turned into rotation, at each step of loss, mechanical wear, temperatures, fluids, the motor vibrates from this conversion, the nozzles crack.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In Tesla there is no box, no cardan, the motor is almost on wheels. Inside - the rotor, copper winding, a set of magnets screwed to a stick. But it rotates too fast, so there is a reduction gear ‚Äî two gears that simply reduce the rotational speeds. And this is all once collected, closed, and not serviced. On Tesla 13th year there was a problem in one of the series, when people managed to damage this gearbox, he started tapping. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It was repaired for free under warranty. Our auto transporter arrives, takes Tesla, drives to Europe and repairs the car there. And all the small things we do here ourselves.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">On a gasoline car if you missed one MOT - goodbye warranty. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If Tesla has never been watched by a hundred thousand kilometers, and something has broken, it is still repaired under warranty in Europe. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Because they are sure that everything will be fine with the car. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There are remote diagnostics. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The owner calls us, we contact Tesla, we agree, the car is in the garage on Wi-Fi, on board Linux, and each light is controlled by a computer. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Chassis - the only thing that is subject to wear. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But any car-care center will deal with hodovka.</font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/mk/nq/wu/mknqwucryipk3iw5gjkmzcxab9a.jpeg"><br><br><h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> For Tesla you will not find spare parts </font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Tesla has a serious policy, because if something happens to the car, it will be in all media: ‚ÄúLook, Tesla has broken! </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">What a bad car! ‚ÄùThe shares went down, everyone who plays shorts is happy. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Therefore, Tesla gives spare parts for a specific car by VIN number. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Here we have a mechanism since the time when we planned to become an official service. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But in short - in comparison with a gasoline car there is nothing to break. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">When Tesla was in Yandex. Taxi, the bumper was torn off. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The next day, the car went as new. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is repaired in an elementary fashion and comes out no more expensive than replacing a bumper on any Land Rover.</font></font><br><br><h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Autopilot, firmware and everything else does not work in Russia </font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For Russia, the car from the States is definitely not suitable. To repair it, you will have to take it to America, because there is a guarantee. Shtatovskaya Tesla another connector that does not accept three-phase electricity. And we have three-phase outlets everywhere. It is worth becoming the owner of an electric car, as you begin to notice them everywhere. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The American road graph has never been loaded into American cars. It will not be possible to pave the way through charging stations in Europe. It can only memorize those on which it was (and in Russia it will not work in principle - we have only one supercharger and that one is unofficial).</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But now the firmware has been released, which does not pave the roads in Russia, even on European models. Navigation just stopped working. This is due to the processing of the autopilot and the fact that they make their own high-precision maps for navigating the lanes. The autopilot engine was changed, the old maps were removed, the new ones were rolled out - and there is only Europe, there is no Russia yet. That is, now navigation in Russia works only on old firmware. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We recently conducted a test drive of the first version of the autopilot on the garden ring in the storm. There he didn‚Äôt act very well. When there is no markup at all, it is guided by traffic. I was badly hurt by cars that were being rebuilt. This is the autopilot of the first generation, it has only one camera. In the storm and without marking, if the car in front of me changed the lane, it would take me along.</font></font><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/be-R2nR5PVI" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But I am sure that the autopilot of the second version would cope. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In such a situation, he would have seen the side traffic and understood that the car was rebuilding ahead and not going along the runway. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the second version, there are eight cameras (three are looking ahead, the others are around), twelve sonars, a long-range radar that sees two cars ahead. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It saved me many times: I'm going to drive a gazelle, Tesla suddenly hits the brake, and a second later the Gazelle hits the brake. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The radar saw that something was wrong ahead. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The autopilot of the first version is designed for driving on tracks with a physical separator and in traffic jams. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Under these conditions, he works in Russia and has always worked. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">You feel that the car is controlled not only by you. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">She will taxi, if you lead, slow down if you gape. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is very cool.</font></font><br><br><h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> From new firmware - some surprises </font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The most unexpected thing that appeared to me was a heated steering wheel. Apparently, the heating elements laid in the design, but not introduced into the firmware immediately. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Secondly, they once wrote to me, ‚ÄúCongratulations, your car has become faster. Optimized the algorithm of the inverter. At this point, you can throw out the TCP with horsepower as an outdated document. Horsepower no longer makes sense because it is governed by software. </font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/z0/iw/qg/z0iwqgo2x5vspcnkyjlw3si8kbm.jpeg"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Mask on Twitter write - why not make a DVR out of the camera? He answers, a great idea, and after four months comes firmware with a DVR. Then he is told that the front camera is small, and Tesla is making a panoramic recorder with several cameras. In addition, it was possible to write a video at 360¬∫ while parked, after the robbers broke glass at one of Tesla.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At some point, the car began to remember by GPS how you set up its air suspension. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">You drive through the familiar speed bump, she rises and falls. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Now there will be an automatic folding mirrors at the entrance to the familiar garage. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A couple of years ago an automatic high beam appeared. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And such trifles Musk always gets to the point.</font></font><br><br><h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> For such money, Tesla's salon could have been better. </font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Yes, for nine million you can buy a car in which you will feel as if you were at a massage therapist. There are premium cars literally with hot stone massage. Tesla does not. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">One well-known owner of the Model S put the salon from BMW. He says he drove them all his life, and believes that the interior is the best there, but as a car, the best Tesla. Therefore, he combined them. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The original profile of the owner was such that Tesla is the fifth car in the garage, because it is very expensive. But often she became the first. There are examples when the first persons of the state travel only to Teslah themselves. According to their status, they are transported in armored Mercedes, and they drive Tesla for fun, and the guards complain that they won't catch up. Because this is a car about the thrill of control, and not comfort in the cabin.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The easiest way to find a common language with the owners of the IT world, because they understand the technical potential. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">They love Tesla not for speed, but for the fact that this engineering cool thing.</font></font><br><br><h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> The autopilot will not cope in a critical situation and will kill all </font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Recently there was a case. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The owner of Tesla had an accident and began to argue that he could not overcome the autopilot. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is physically impossible. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Usually the company always says that they need time to investigate, but here the representative spoke immediately and said that this could not be. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For skeptics, you can always check the logs. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Even if, for some reason, the autopilot began to struggle with the driver, the driver would still overtake him - this is done mechanically. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Now the driver decides the fate on the road. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But soon it will be done by a programmer.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There may be a situation when the autopilot knows in advance that he will kill a pedestrian 100%. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The pedestrian jumped out sharply, and the autopilot would realize that he could be saved only by breaking the rules and putting the driver at risk. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">How does he behave? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The human driver will act irrationally, dodging luck, not realizing the consequences, but in the case of the autopilot, everything has long been considered. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The guys who sit in the R &amp; D - I think they decided an ethical dilemma long ago. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The car tries to act according to the rules, but in the border cases the autopilot will save people in the car, otherwise cars will not buy. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It may sound cynical, but a car that, breaking the rules, will sacrifice a driver to save pedestrians, is unlikely to become popular.</font></font></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/449978/">https://habr.com/ru/post/449978/</a></p>
