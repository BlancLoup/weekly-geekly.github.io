  <section class="page js-page"><h1>8 kilobyte error</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Friday afternoon.  In a not very big company there is a very big panic.  Tom and other web developers have quickly finished off the latest fixes of the customer‚Äôs new web store, which should have been submitted two weeks earlier. <br><br>  Tom committed the latest change to the CSS file in SVN and wiped the sweat from his brow.  He updated the local repository and switched back to Dreamweaver, taking a deep breath.  The company's web designers have insisted developers use Dreamweaver.  He, of course, is not so bad, Tom thought, although there are better tools ... <br><br>  Dreamweaver has closed. <a name="habracut"></a>
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

        </script>
      <br>
      Tom froze.  This he has not seen.  He launched Dreamweaver again.  This time it fell right after launch.  After the next attempt, it closed again a couple of seconds after launch. <br><br>  "Here is a pancake ..." Tom muttered, looking for the Restart button. <br><br>  The company's network policy and boot scripts guaranteed him a minimum five-minute pause, and Tom already wanted to finally finish the job and go home.  In the meantime, voices began to be heard from neighboring cubes. <br><br>  "What the ... Dreamweaver?" <br><br>  "And you have it, too, falls?" <br><br>  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm falling too,‚Äù Tom voiced. <br><br>  After some time, the problem manifested itself in all web developers and designers in the company.  Restarting Windows did not help. <br><br>  On Friday after lunch, the developers tried to catch those admins who had not yet managed to go home.  ‚ÄúSo, start a full virus scan for everyone,‚Äù one of the remaining admins commanded. <br><br>  Antiviruses did not find anything suspicious.  One of the developers restored his car from the archive image - but this did not solve the problem.  Minutes of idleness slowly turned into hours.  Managers began to panic.  Unfortunately, the urgently assembled meeting ‚ÄúWell, quickly fix everything,‚Äù also did not help, including because all the remaining admins were brought to the meeting. <br><br>  Tom was tormented by a vague concern that the strange problem began immediately after his commit.  So far, he has not shared his fears with anyone, but sooner or later someone will guess to see the commit log.  How the heck does CSS make it crash? <br><br>  Yet Tom decided to google on the glitches of Dreamweaver.  On the first page of the search there was nothing interesting, but then he found a link on the forum, where a very similar situation was described.  Tom flipped through the thread of answers quickly, noting the options one by one, until he saw this: <br><br>  "Dreamweaver crashes when you try to open a file that is exactly 8 kilobytes in size." <br><br>  "What?  Yes, it's full ... " <br><br>  But he decided to look at the file size.  32768 bytes. <br><br>  Well, well ... Tom opened the calculator, 32768/8192 = <br><br>  The answer appeared on the calculator screen.  4. The file was exactly 32 kilobytes long.  Four times 8K. <br><br>  Still not believing, Tom opened the ill-fated CSS file and added another line at the end with an empty comment.  Made a commit.  Made an update.  Launched Dreamweaver. <br><br>  Dreamweaver started and did not fall. <br><br>  Tom waited a few seconds and shouted loudly: ‚ÄúUpdate SVN!  In my opinion, I fixed it. ‚Äù <br><br>  Soon all returned to the interrupted work.  Tom sent a mail <a href="https://forums.adobe.com/thread/417116%3Fstart%3D0%26tstart%3D0">with a link to a forum</a> with a description of the 8 kilobyte problem, but preferred to keep silent that it was his commit that led to this problem. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/357608/">https://habr.com/ru/post/357608/</a></p>
