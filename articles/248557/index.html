  <section class="page js-page"><h1>"Race robots" in the Ural Federal</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  On January 10, a regional robotics competition ‚ÄúRobot Racing‚Äù was held at the Ural Federal University on the parquet of the State Management Committee.  About 300 people from 25 cities of the Ural region took part in the competition.  Competitions were held in 3 nominations: <br>  "Novices", which the robots for the competition provided the Ural Federal University; <br>  "Lovers" participated in competitions with their robots; <br>  "Professionals", for them the route of increased complexity was prepared. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The main organizer of the event was the UrFU youth science department.  According to the head of the department, Alexei Barashev, ‚ÄúThe Ural Federal University pays great attention to the development of student science, I am sure that it is necessary to create conditions for technical creativity in the school.‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f94/745/5cd/f947455cd3f544719649089a4c845e57.png"><br><br>  The event was opened: AV Misyura, Minister of Industry and Science of the Sverdlovsk Region, V. Kruzhaev, Vice-Rector for Science of the Ural Federal University, S.V. Yaroshenko, Head of the Department for Work with Enterprises, I.N.  Obabkov.  Also during the whole event, the Deputy Minister of General and Professional Education of the Sverdlovsk Region A. Pakhomov followed the competition.

      As part of the ‚ÄúRobot Racing‚Äù, an exhibition of advances in robotics at Ural Federal University was organized, at which the project of a mobile robot Telepresence, created by a student at the Mechanical Engineering Institute at UrFU, A. Belousov, attracted great interest. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/289/435/010/289435010ac8454380ac152b6d864700.png" alt="image"><br><br>  After the races, master classes were held for the participants.  For the "lovers" was held a master class on the basics of 3D printing with the manufacture of simple parts on a 3D printer.  The master class was conducted by the founder and leader of the first Make-it-lab in the Urals, Oleg Evsegneev. <br><br>  Two master classes were held in the ‚ÄúProfi‚Äù category: from Vladimir Pelevin, Head of the Laboratory of Robotics and Intellectual Systems at the Institute of Fundamental Education, and Alexander Lemekh, Head of the Laboratory of Robotics Development at MMI UrFU. <br><br>  V. Pelevin told the schoolchildren about the projects of the laboratory, explained the problem of navigating a mobile robot in space.  The theme of the master class A. Lemeha were autonomous flying robots.  The schoolchildren were shown a video clip of the tests of a robotic rescue complex developed by 9 leading universities of the European Union.  At this master class, participants were invited to join the work of the Laboratory on finalizing the project of a flying robot as part of a unique educational project Internet Test Drive, the Hi-Tech direction. <br><br>  Separately, I would like to mention the robotics club of the Higher Engineering School of UrFU, which was one of the main organizers, developers of ideas, regulations and routes.  The guys focused on the ‚ÄúNewbies‚Äù - schoolchildren who had never collected robots in their lives.  Egor Tryakshin told how it is possible to assemble an elementary robot from available tools using publicly available components sold in any radio shop.  He tried not only to show where some components need to be put, but also to explain in a language understandable to the student how each component works. <br><br>  After the master classes, the event organizers announced the winners in each category.  Among the ‚Äúnewbies‚Äù, the team of ‚ÄúBortekhaniki‚Äù became the best; among the ‚Äúlovers‚Äù, the team of ‚ÄúAnDor‚Äù showed the best time, and the guys from the ‚ÄúHachiko‚Äù team were the first in the ‚Äúpro‚Äù category.  Congratulations to the winners! <br><br>  The head of the Make-it-lab hackspace Oleg Evsegneev shares his impressions: ‚ÄúI was glad to participate in the organization of such a large-scale robotics competition!  Long chose what to give the winners.  I wanted the prizes not just to be on the shelf, but to further develop the engineering thinking of the guys.  As a result, in all three nominations were presented by domestic electronic designers from Amperky.  The main prize, for the first place in the nomination ‚ÄúProfi,‚Äù was a kit for assembling a 3D printer! ‚Äù <br><br>  The event turned out to be interesting and, most importantly, exciting.  Here's how the judge describes the race in the nomination ‚ÄúLovers‚Äù Alexander Tarasov: ‚ÄúMany participants had passion in their eyes, even those who did not get to the top place were very happy to improve their results, let it be a whole second or even some hundredths of her share.  This is real, sporting behavior, worthy of respect!  I am very pleased that the participants received a charge of good mood, I hope they will remember this day and, of course, will go to our University to continue their journey in the field of robotics! ‚Äù <br><br>  The event was covered by representatives of regional media: Studio TWIST, Channel 4 and others.  For many fans who could not come to the competition, the live broadcast was organized on the Internet. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/248557/">https://habr.com/ru/post/248557/</a></p>
