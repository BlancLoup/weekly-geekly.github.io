      1. Products and solutions for end users <br><br>  2. Products and solutions for professional participants in the multimedia market <br><br><h4>  ACE Stream in brief </h4><br>  <b>ACE Stream</b> is a new generation of innovative multimedia platform, which includes a variety of products and solutions for both regular Internet users and professional participants of the multimedia market. <br><br>  <i><b>Note:</b> ACE Stream uses a P2P (peer-to-peer) technology based on the BitTorrent protocol, which is recognized as the most efficient protocol for transmitting / delivering ‚Äúheavy content‚Äù.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>ACE Stream is much more than just a BitTorrent client for sharing files over P2P networks!</i> <br><br>  <b>The main areas of specialization of the platform:</b> AVoD (Audio and Video on Request);  Live Stream (live streaming);  Localization of foreign BitTorrent traffic;  Decentralized social networks;  IOTT (Interactive-Over-The-Top) - Interactive services on top of broadcasts. <br><br>  The ACE Stream platform provides the unrivaled audio-visual quality of online broadcasts / shows on the Internet and the most efficient system for storing and delivering video and audio content! <br><br>  <i><b>Note:</b> ACE Stream users watch online video with an audiovisual quality level that is more than 10 times higher than the quality of videos on YouTube (presented in 1080p format) and many times exceeds the shows / broadcasts of all other existing VoD and Live Stream services performed by operators of OTT (Over The Top) services that do not use efficient P2P technology.</i> <br><br>  <i>In addition, none of the standard Live Stream services and any of the CDN operators using unicast can perform / provide live broadcast with such a high level of quality and for as many viewers as a regular user of the ACE Stream can broadcast to from its normal personal computer when using a home internet channel!</i>  <i>(None of the existing CDN operators will be able to provide unicast broadcast in Full HD format, with a bitrate of 10 -15 Mbps, even for 100,000 simultaneous viewers!)</i> <br><br><h4>  Details </h4><br>  So, today I want to announce exactly that part of the project, which relates to end users, and provide information: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/torrentstream/blog/155485/">About ACE Stream Media (basic configuration of the ACE Stream platform)</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/torrentstream/blog/155485/">About the features that are available to users of ACE Stream</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/torrentstream/blog/155485/">About the advantages of ACE Stream over other BitTorrent clients</a> </li></ul><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><a name="media"></a><br><h4>  ACE Stream Media (basic configuration of the ACE Stream platform) </h4><br>  <b>ACE Stream Media</b> is a comprehensive solution that includes several basic ACE Stream products (you can change the bundle and expand it with other client and server products) <br><br>  Basic components of ACE Stream Media: <br><br><ul><li>  <b>ACE Stream HD</b> - Multimedia <b>Stream</b> Manager (BitTorrent is a new generation client!). </li></ul><br>  Universal cross-platform software application for work in P2P (BitTorrent) network. <br><br>  <i><b>Note:</b> This is the main software product that provides all the functions and capabilities of ACE Stream technology.</i> <br><br>  <b>Versatility: The</b> application can operate in different modes, performing various functions and tasks, acting as a client and / or server application. <br><br>  <b>Client part</b> <br><br>  It can work in the following modes: <br><ul><li>  customer; </li><li>  live broadcast source; </li><li>  remote client </li></ul><br><br>  <b>Server part</b> <br><br>  It can work in the following modes: <br><ul><li>  live broadcast source; </li><li>  live broadcast support node / server; </li><li>  P2P Proxy Stream </li></ul><br><br>  <i><b>Note:</b> The P2P Proxy Stream feature provides the ability to replace / transform P2P traffic on HTTP, on the fly!</i>  <i>(that is, changing data transfer protocols will be carried out instantly, in real time) This function allows you to receive data on a host / server using the bittorrent protocol or simultaneously using several network protocols (HTTP + BitTorrent) and transmit them further via another protocol.</i> <br><br><ul><li>  <b>ACE Stream P2P Multimedia Plug-in</b> - A versatile web player, based on libvlc </li></ul><br>  Web Browser Plugin <br><br>  New innovative features of ACE Stream, as well as all the power and functionality of the most popular player in the world (VLC), are available in a web browser through the ‚ÄúACE Stream P2P Multimedia Plug-in‚Äù plugin. <br><br>  <i><b>Note:</b> This web player, in conjunction with ‚ÄúACE Stream HD‚Äù, will provide an excellent alternative to Flash players, which are significantly inferior in functionality and cannot provide VoD services with such effective use / use of P2P technology.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>You can use the most functional and best web player in the world on the pages of various websites, including You Tube and other popular video hosting sites, as well as on various websites using ACE Stream technology.</i> <br><br><ul><li>  <b>ACE Player HD</b> - This is an improved version of the VLC multimedia player, with support for the BitTorrent protocol. </li></ul><br>  <b>The main distinguishing feature from the original version of VLC:</b> Allows you to play online video and audio content through torrent files, as well as through other transport files and methods that are supported by the BitTorrent protocol and ACE Stream technology. <br><br>  <i><b>Note:</b> The player can work with both local and remote application ‚ÄúACE Stream HD‚Äù (P2P client).</i> <br><br><ul><li>  <b><a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/123299/">TS Magic Player</a></b> - Additional extension for Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome and Opera browsers. </li></ul><br>  Allows you to play online video and audio content on any sites that contain links to torrent files, without the need to download torrent files and without tiring waiting for downloading the content itself. <br><a name="features"></a><br><h4>  Features that are available to users of ACE Stream </h4><br><br><ul><li>  <b>AVoD (Audio and Video on Demand)</b> </li></ul><br>  Online playback of video and audio content using BitTorrent protocol. <br><br>  <i><b>Note:</b> You no longer need to pre-download huge files to watch FullHD video or listen to audio in Lossless formats!</i>  <i>ACE Stream allows you to enjoy online playback of the best audiovisual quality content in all the most popular and common formats.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>You can play through convenient transport files and URI-schemes, both in desktop players / applications, and directly in web players on any sites that have support for ACE Stream technology.</i> <br><br>  <b>Supported transport files and URI schemes / protocols:</b> <br><br>  - Files: .torrent, .acestream, .tstream, <br>  - URI schemes: magnet links (temporarily not supported), acestream links (analog magnet) Content ID - search and launch of a video / audio stream through the content identifier in the ACE Stream system <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Live Stream (live streaming)</b> </li></ul><br>  Creating and viewing live broadcasts via P2P networks <br><br>  A new innovative feature ‚ÄúLive Stream‚Äù allows you to perform high-quality live broadcasts on the Internet in FullHD format, without the need to maintain a fleet of servers and attract expensive standard CDN operators. <br><br>  <i><b>Note:</b> Creating live broadcasts, viewing them, as well as sharing live broadcasts, is now as accessible and convenient as using regular torrent files and magnet links, and even much easier!</i> <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Turning BitTorrent trackers into online cinemas</b> </li></ul><br>  Solutions and products based on ACE Stream allow one-click launch of online playback of video and audio content on any site that contains links to torrent files, without the need to download torrent files and without waiting to download the content itself. <br><br>  <i><b>Note:</b> This feature is provided by the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/123299/">Magic Player</a> product and / or through various integration of various applications and Internet services through the ACE Stream API, incl.</i>  <i>and through the integration of BitTorrent trackers with the Torrent Stream system (Torrent Stream is a system for legalizing content in peer-to-peer networks).</i> <br><br><ul><li>  <b>BitTorrent Accelerator (HTTP stream accelerator)</b> </li></ul><br>  Playing video clips on popular video hosting sites, supported by BitTorrent protocol (for example, on YouTube) <br>  When playing videos, each user receives a video stream not only from one of the remote video hosting servers, but additionally from all users who are watching or have already watched this video. <br><br>  Using the ‚ÄúBitTorrent Accelerator‚Äù you help other people, while others help you, and everyone will teach the video stream with maximum speed! <br><br>  <b>Note:</b> Will work on all video hosting sites that have support for ACE Stream technology or by using extensions to web browsers (an example of such an extension: <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/torrentstream/blog/144046/">P2P YouTube</a> ) <br><br><ul><li>  <b>The ability to use any players and media centers for online playback of content.</b> </li></ul><br>  ACE Stream users are not limited to a single player and can use any players and media centers that support ACE Stream technology to play content. <br><br>  <i><b>Note:</b> The technology is supported through the use of the ACE Stream API, and can be implemented directly in the player or the media center, as well as through various additional products (for example: through plug-ins / extensions to players and media centers)</i> <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Convenient system of publishing, sharing and receiving audiovisual information</b> </li></ul><br>  It is no longer necessary to use various file storages, video hosting and other web services to show recorded video or to create your own live broadcast on the Internet.  It is no longer necessary to upload video files anywhere and wear down the hours of waiting for your friends, relatives, and other people while they can watch it.  A couple of clicks and within a few seconds your video and audio files, as well as your live broadcasts, will be available to other ACE Stream users for online playback. <br><br>  <i><b>Note:</b> All publications, sharing and receiving audiovisual information is done decentralized via the BitTorrent protocol!</i> <br><br>  <b>You will have the opportunity to:</b> <br><br><ul><li>  Publish http-links and acestream ‚Äì links (similar to magnet-links) or content IDs (Content ID) and share them in any way convenient for you. </li><li>  Stir the web players with their own broadcasts / shows on the pages of websites (social networks, forums, blogs, etc.) </li><li>  Create personal channels with live broadcast in P2P networks. </li><li>  Personalize the look of the web player and pages with players for each of your releases or live broadcasts, creating for them an individual thematic design and expanding them with social components. </li><li>  Set privacy mode for published content: <br>  a) ‚ÄúPrivate‚Äù - VoD or live broadcast intended for personal use only; <br>  b) ‚ÄúFor the circle of the family‚Äù - access for persons belonging to the circle of your family (through social networks) <br>  c) ‚ÄúConfidential‚Äù - opening personal access for users defined by the user; <br>  d) ‚ÄúGroup‚Äù - for all participants who are members of a group on social networks <br>  e) ‚ÄúPublic‚Äù - for all users of ACE Stream; <br>  f) ‚ÄúBusiness‚Äù - access for payment (monthly subscription or one-time access) </li><li>  Protects your content (video / audio files and live broadcasts) from unauthorized viewing and distribution. </li></ul><br>  <i><b>Note:</b> The content protection system ACE Stream allows you to use all the advantages and capabilities of the BitTorrent protocol in private or commercial shows / broadcasts.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>For the ‚ÄúGroup‚Äù and ‚ÄúPublic‚Äù modes, it is possible to monetize content through advertising and / or receive promotional bonuses / buns for popular non-commercial broadcasts / shows (similar to the YouTube model, only in BitTorrent networks)</i> <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Turbo Stream function</b> (No analogues in the world!) </li></ul><br>  Service feature for Premium ACE Stream Users <br><br>  <b>Two modes:</b> <br><br><ol><li>  <b>Gold Seeding</b> - Guaranteed video / audio stream for online playback of content through torrent files and magnet links, regardless of the number of peers and their upload speed.  Also, this function provides instant start of the start of playback (minimum time for pre-buffering) and instant response when rewinding. </li><li>  <b>Silver Seeding</b> - Depends on the speed of recoil of the seed, but at the same time it can significantly improve the start speed of the start of playback and provide an instant response when rewinding.  In addition, this mode will provide the smoothest possible viewing, eliminating the main causes of P2P problems, which may cause delays during playback (stops for buffering). </li></ol><br><br>  <i><b>Note:</b> Considering that the ‚ÄúTurbo Stream‚Äù function not only provides end users with unique capabilities, but also allows Internet providers to use this server solution to effectively localize foreign / foreign BitTorrent traffic (more than 90%), it is quite likely that this service will be supported directly by your ISP.</i>  <i>In this case, no matter which site / BitTorrent tracker you use to get torrents / magnet links, your downloads will always go at the maximum available speed for your Internet channel on the local network.</i>  <i>And of course, the support of such a function directly by an Internet provider will be a huge advantage for those users who have traffic separation into local and external / foreign.</i> <br><br><ul><li>  <b>ACE Stream Cloud</b> </li></ul><br>  Cloud service that has no analogues in the world!  (‚ÄúCloudy‚Äù is not quite correct wording, but considering what is now called ‚Äúclouds‚Äù, the majority will understand the essence and purpose of the service) <br><br>  The possibility of online playback of video and audio content through torrents and magnet links, without the need to install a P2P client.  When using "ACE Stream Cloud", the user receives data / stream via HTTP from remote servers <br><br>  <b>Supported transport file formats:</b> torrent, acestream, acelive, tstream. <br>  Also supported are: magnet links, acestream links and Content ID (content identifier in the ACE Stream System) <br><br>  <b>The main feature and uniqueness of the service:</b> - Substitution / transformation of P2P traffic on HTTP / HTTPS, will occur on the fly!  (that is, the change of data transfer protocols will be carried out instantly, in real time, without having to wait for the data to load to the cloud service) <br><br>  <i><b>Note:</b> Relevant for users who want to watch videos and listen to audio distributed through BitTorrent networks, but who have difficulty using a P2P client (For example: the provider cuts P2P traffic; there is no P2P client under OC; and m .d.)</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>This function may be available to you not only from our cloud service, but also directly from your Internet provider, as the server solution used is also included in a comprehensive solution for providers that ensures maximum localization of external / foreign BitTorrent traffic.</i>  <i>Actually using our software, anyone can organize such a service, both within the entire Internet space and in the local network.</i> <br><br><a name="benefits"></a><br><h4>  Some advantages of ACE Stream over other BitTorrent clients </h4><br>  (‚ÄúBitTorrent-clients‚Äù, hereinafter referred to as ‚Äúclients‚Äù) <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Start playing torrents online, in one click.</b>  No other customers! </li></ul><br>  One-click ability to launch online playback of video and audio content on any site containing links to torrent files. <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Quick start / minimum wait time before starting to play content.</b> </li></ul><br>  Less time is spent on pre-buffering than in other clients. <br><br><ul><li>  <b>New HTTP2P / Best Support for HTTP Siding</b> </li></ul><br>  All the best from the two protocols (HTTP and BitTorrent), combined together! <br><br>  In the presence of high-quality HTTP-support (HTTP-sid), the start speed of the start of playback exceeds the work of other clients many times.  It also provides instant response when rewinding. <br><br>  <i><b>Note:</b> When using HTTP2P, the speed of start and response when rewinding is absolutely not inferior to any other standard VoD technology (Video on Demand), while allowing you to get the incredible benefits of effectively using P2P.</i> <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Playback without delay</b> (without interruption to buffering) </li></ul><br>  Under the same conditions, ACE Stream provides smoother / more stable video playback than other clients.  In addition, the mode providing the necessary level of prebuffering can be optionally used for playback without delays if the download speed is lower than the bit rate of the content being played. <br><br><ul><li>  <b>The ability to start playing from any time interval.</b>  No other customers! </li></ul><br>  It allows you to set the length of time from which the content will start playing, both during the personal launch of playback of the content, and during its publication and / or sharing. <br><br><ul><li>  <b>The ability to rewind.</b>  No other customers! </li></ul><br>  Rewinding is performed in the same way as when playing video and audio files stored on the user's local device. <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Convenient work with the playlist</b> (for example, if the torrent contains several video files) Not in other clients! </li></ul><br>  - Ability to create a playlist of video / audio files contained in one or more torrents. <br>  - Selection of the order of playing files <br>  - Seamless transition between playable files. <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Protect cached data.</b>  No other customers! </li></ul><br>  All content being played, in order to ensure maximum efficiency of P2P operation, is temporarily stored in a dedicated technical folder (cache) with an auto-cleaning function.  All cache data is encrypted and not available to the user for playback.  This provides protection, both for users of client applications, from any charges in storing content being played online ( <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/torrentstream/blog/151522/">details</a> ), and provides content authors with the opportunity to fully use the full potential of BitTorrent, while fully protecting their content from unauthorized use and distribution. <br><br>  <i><b>Note:</b> Saving freely distributed files in a user-friendly place and in open form is available through the Save / Save function, which is invoked via the corresponding Save button located on the control panel of players that have ACE Stream technology support.</i> <br><br><ul><li>  <b>The ability of the bittorent protocol to support any video viewed on video hosting sites</b> </li></ul>  (for example, on YouTube, etc.).  No other customers! <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Online playback of all the most popular formats.</b> </li></ul><br>  ACE Stream products allow you to play video files through torrents that can not be played online in many other clients, including through a bunch of utorrent + vlc (for example, AVI containers, in OpenDML format) <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Efficient and harmless algorithm to work with BitTorrent-network, with online playback of content</b> . </li></ul><br>  ACE Stream does not use a mandatory sequential download of data pieces / segments, as is used in some bittorrent clients.  The applied algorithm is absolutely harmless and harmonious for a bittorrent swarm, and does not cause problems with traffic jams, as it can happen with the mandatory sequential loading of pieces / data segments, during the operation of some other clients. <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Live Stream - live / streaming.</b> </li></ul><br>  - Minimum delay time <br>  - pause function <br>  - Function Time Shift (Ability to view the broadcast from the past period of time, up to - 60 min.) <br><br>  <i><b>Note:</b> A unique feature of our implementation of the Time Shift function is that it works for all existing P2P broadcasts, without having to turn it on first and record the broadcast on the user device.</i>  <i>To use the Time Shift function, you do not need to record video!</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/155485/">https://habr.com/ru/post/155485/</a></p>
