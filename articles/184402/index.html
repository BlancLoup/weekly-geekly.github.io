  <section class="page js-page"><h1>OCZ Silencer Mk III Power Supply Overview</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> Reviews of "iron" - a rarity for today's Habr, and even more reviews of power supplies.  Why OCZ Silencer Mk III?  The answer is very prosaic - it is white.  As an owner of a white case with a transparent window, I wished with all my heart the appearance of a good white power supply unit.  Of course, you can paint the existing black unit or cover it with film, but this is not a serial solution for everyone, not every user will sacrifice a guarantee for the sake of aesthetics.  There are very few offers on the market for connoisseurs of white components, and there was a time when motherboards based on white PCB or a white video card were not considered exotic.  What other advantages, besides the color range, does this block have?  Under the cut will be the answer. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/bfc/880/5ee/bfc8805ee14bb304da98e0c4fa1a8d16.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a>  Once again I try to move away from the practice of describing the packaging of devices, but I still have to make a small stop at this point.  Obviously, neither carrying handles nor other beautiful and bright packages should influence the choice of the buyer of a high-tech device, but Chinese marketers are still sure of the opposite.  To the credit of PC Power &amp; Cooling, which has long been involved in the production of power supplies in the company OCZ, they minimalist and stylishly designed the box.  Grayish cardboard and only two colored badges - 80 Plus Gold certificate and a seven-year warranty mark.  Presumably, such a period did not arise from scratch, and OCZ are confident in the quality of their BP. <img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/28b/4ac/c01/28b4acc01598db771de7382333d4386f.jpg"><br>  The reverse side of the box offers to read brief specifications in English and to get acquainted with the patented development of an almost silent mode of operation.  With a load of up to 350 watts, the power supply fan barely rotates, thus ensuring the lowest level of noise on its part. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a8b/9a7/28b/a8b9a728b5cc42eff3688bcf4e61dbce.jpg"><br>  Inside the box are two bags of cloth, in one of them - the power supply itself is packed, and in the second - modular cables for connecting peripheral devices. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/10d/b31/546/10db31546877eadf2adbcd669e63ac4e.jpg"><br>  The case of the power supply is white, painted with powder paint and looks quite solid.  A little dissonance in the overall picture is made by a black fan and a black grill.  It would be great to see a white grill and, for example, a transparent fan with white LED backlighting, organized not from four corners, but around the whole circumference.  Stickers on the sides report that we have a 750-watt PC Power &amp; Cooling Silencer Mk III power supply in front of us.  Again, a white sticker with black letters, IMHO, would look more interesting. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/bfc/880/5ee/bfc8805ee14bb304da98e0c4fa1a8d16.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/118/659/475/118659475e0847e76838d53f387b8101.jpg"><br>  The modular system on the unit is made on the so-called aviation connectors.  Eight sockets are located at one of the ends of the power supply.  The power cable for the motherboard is 24-pin non-removable and for some reason tightened in black braid.  Once again I will hold a demarche about this.  Why do white power supply, if the wires still remain black?  Why it is impossible to order white wires for thin cables and a white braid for thick?  The very meaning of acquiring a white power supply is crumbling.  Another nail there is the black bolts that are screwed into the white case of the block - even take the brush and repaint. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c56/c50/0c9/c56c500c988e3887a40a43e0225f4a31.jpg"><br>  The connectors are securely fastened; after installation in the socket, they are fixed with a nut.  The ability to install the connector is incorrectly missing, the key is large, and even if you make a serious effort, the user cannot insert the cable differently. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/07d/fd5/8ed/07dfd58ed01db929a7bbf069e92964ad.jpg"><br><br>  The back of the power supply is made of mesh, through which hot air is emitted from the PSU.  The 220V power connector and the switch are standard elements, just above which the power supply system cooling mode switch is located - from normal to quiet.  Let me remind you that when the silent mode is on with a load of up to 350 watts, the fan practically does not rotate, and only at high power consumption does it start to increase speed.  A good thing for those who most of the time use the computer for "peaceful" purposes.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a16/c29/eae/a16c29eaee2d59f16cf747343f1e3084.jpg"><br>  The sticker on the upper surface of the power supply (again mostly black) indicates the name of the model, the strength of the currents along the different lines, contains many certificates of varying severity, and also warns in several languages ‚Äã‚Äãthat it is not necessary to go inside.  Tells that inside everything is energized, that only authorized personnel can open the unit and that there are no serviceable components inside the power supply.  But nothing is written in Russian =).  So, armed with a screwdriver, I boldly open the power supply. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2f0/144/d44/2f0144d449b00dc09b7ce83c3e8568e5.jpg"><br>  "- Fedor, what is written there? - Made in China. - I was afraid of that."  (C) The fraternity and the ring.  However, this has long been no surprise.  The lion's share of all the electronics of the world is made precisely in the Middle Kingdom.  And in the case of power supplies, this story is 99% true.  A long time ago, it was the order of many eminent manufacturers to order OEM boards from unknown Chinese vendors.  Of course, everyone knows Thermaltake, Cooler Master, Corsair or Zalman power supplies, but few have ever heard of Channel Well Technology, ATNG or Super Flower.  In the case of the OCZ Silencer Mk III, the parent of the power supply is Super Flower.  The quality of production of the block is not satisfactory, the quality control in purchasing is at a high level. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c2b/2e8/9ae/c2b2e89ae4726a75a2fac902f56516ae.jpg"><br>  In the lower left corner of the board (or in the upper right corner, if you turn the monitor over), you can see the marking, which indicates that a single platform is used for power supplies with a capacity of 300 to 800 watts.  This is rather good than bad, because for sure it was designed to meet the maximum requirements and the production of low-power power supply takes place simply without installing additional elements.  Since I have a 750-watt version in my hands, there are practically no empty seats on the board.  As a positive point, it is worth noting the presence of separate voltage converters for channels 3.3 and 5 volts.  In addition to standard electrolytic capacitors, ceramic and solid-state capacitors are used in the power supply unit, which should be well reflected in the "purity" of the output voltages. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/44f/693/918/44f693918610ceb9e9ff3e1de95c677e.jpg"><br>  The insides of the power supply are blown with a 140 to 140 mm Globe Fan fan.  The maximum rotation speed is 2000 rpm. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/199/728/a9c/199728a9cf08719cb39544957a952180.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2b6/ee8/b8b/2b6ee8b8b3ef40e13eefec339c193e90.jpg"><br><br>  According to the general characteristics of the power supply, it can be argued that it is the place in the beautiful and powerful gaming machines.  What in fact?  To begin with, I plug the wires into the Chinese miracle device, which will show voltages along the lines without load, well, in general, will the working power supply demonstrate?  Mischief managed!  A small, only 0.1V, exceeding the lines of 5 and 12 volts is quite acceptable, and the measurement error of the miracle device may be larger than usual. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/98d/627/468/98d62746811ec7103aaf39537efe24cb.jpg"><br>  Therefore, for this test, we take a more reliable device.  The load was created by a powerful gaming configuration: Intel Core i7 3770K @ 4.5 GHz;  16 Gb RAM;  256 Gb SSD;  ASUS Radeon HD 7970 Matrix, this computer was launched in a cyclic mode, the most recent of the synthetic tests - 3D Mark Fire Strike.  The measurements were carried out using a Velleman digital oscilloscope. <br>  Voltage stability is at a very high level.  Of course, the power supply OCZ Silencer Mk III justifies hopes to see a quality product.  The amplitude of the pulsations along the 12 V line (perhaps the most important indicator) does not exceed 30 mV - this is the grandmaster level, and the 3.3V line generally stands still rooted to the spot (although it is not specifically used). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f01/180/ae1/f01180ae1d9248e5ce453257fec2a5bc.png"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9b0/07c/964/9b007c964cee082f8bdbd888d4dab75d.png"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7c2/5ae/4b8/7c25ae4b8fd9b589bce5214244cfd83c.png"><br>  As for the results of the power supply, I would say this: the thing is cool, high-quality, worthwhile.  Excellent quiet cooling system, which at night will not interfere with sleep when the torrent is turned on, and during the day when playing tanchiki will not fail.  The seven-year warranty allows you to sleep peacefully for a long time, the rest of the components will most likely fail.  But there are nuances. <br>  Once again I will give a list of my personal wishes on the exterior of the unit - paint the screws and grill white, make the wires and braid also white, replace the fan with a transparent one (possibly with a white LED backlight). <br>  Otherwise, a great choice for connoisseurs of not only power, but also a stylish appearance. <br>  UPD.  Right now in the Russian retail block does not buy, the expected price is just below 5,000 rubles </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/184402/">https://habr.com/ru/post/184402/</a></p>
