Got both screams and panic on the subject ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Part one. </h4><br>  So, the average scenario. <br><br>  First mission.  On the eve of total apophigey. <br>  As a result, all of them have a banal grandmother, their heat, water, energy, food and other supplies are disturbed.  To complete the mission you need to provide the necessary level of reserves for yourself and your family.  Buy 3 shotguns, 5 body armor, canned food for 15 years ahead, because before this period nothing will end. <br><br>  Mission Two.  The onset of total apofigey. <br>  Grandmas ended, products, too, the shelves are empty.  To pass the mission you need to go to the country / to the village / hazendu.  Plant all neighborhoods kartokhoy, zucchini and other goodies, because waiting for a hungry time.

      Mini game.  Shooting from shotguns neighbors, attempting to harvest.  Aim a hundred neighbors.  With the loss of more than 1% of the harvest you will die of hunger. <br><br>  Mission Three.  During the total apofigey. <br>  The brutal population begins to feed on each other.  Power structures are paralyzed and cannot maintain order, massacre and general nightmare.  To pass the mission it is necessary to freeze at forty degrees Celsius, on skis, along a windbreak, at night to get to the nearest nychka 150 kilometers from you.  It takes 3 days to walk through, you can only move at night and avoid accidental meetings with hungry locals who can kill you to death. <br><br>  Mission Four.  After total apofigey. <br>  The rulers can not stand the nerves and they begin to war atomic warts.  Your task is to have time to dig an air-raid shelter and transport a 15-year stock of canned food there. <br><br>  Mini game.  During the atomic war, it is necessary to have time to dodge bombs.  The goal is to dodge four thousand times. <br><br>  Fifth Mission  After the atomic war. <br>  On a tame bear, with a balalaika in one hand, canned black caviar in the other, and vodka in the third hand to explore the surrounding area.  And then any of the post-apocalyptic strategies. <br><br>  Then my fantasy ended.  Continue on your own.  In principle, any of the missions can be broken not a few sub-steps, the benefit of the material is more than enough.  Who will take up the implementation of the masterpiece?  I think success is guaranteed. <br><br><h4>  Part two. </h4><br>  All my life I thought that if a lot of smart people get together (this is me about you, habravchane), then they will come up with something brilliant.  But alas, on the topic of crisis, except for the cries: ‚ÄúHow terrible to live, we all will die‚Äù - I can't hear anything else.  Well, more articles in the style of the first part.  Strange why, nothing more reasonable, except for a follaut or something similar to it, does not occur?  They probably beat the toys. <br>  Here are my thoughts on this. <br>  There will be no total assholes.  It is not beneficial to anyone.  Now all the forces of the world are aimed at stabilizing the American economy.  And ours too.  Simply, it has the greatest weight of all - if you quench the destructive impulse in it, then everyone else will also stop oscillating.  This is neither good nor bad - just so the historical circumstances.  The world experiences this every 20-50 years.  There may be an incorrect comparison, but you can draw an analogy with a world war, just a different plan.  In our country in the 90s it was much worse than now.  Remember yourself or ask your elders.  And nothing survived and everything is fine.  There will be a phased discharge of steam, good learned. <br>  There will be no total ass for our country either.  There will be no war for our resources either.  See the major shareholders of our corporations.  They will not fight with themselves.  And all these cries, just theater.  Plus there is a very good integration with the West.  No one will divide our country either - we are too big, I emphasize too, and only we have experience with such vast territories.  The war with China - he will break himself, too many people, wait 15 years and see everything, they will also be saved by the whole world. <br>  The only thing to fear is, I believe, these are restless elements in the East, both near and far, but this unrest arises only because of provocations and ill-considered actions.  Well, and, probably, still global warming (or cooling), although I still did not really understand this question. <br>  And finally - two billions have nothing to eat for tomorrow, and nothing lives somehow. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/61486/">https://habr.com/ru/post/61486/</a></p>
