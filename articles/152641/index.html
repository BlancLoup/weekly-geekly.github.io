  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Code Venture: Man-hours Investment</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> Good afternoon, dear reader.  I am a C ++ programmer with a total work experience approaching 5 years. <br> <code> 2010       " ",   .   (  )   2 ,      .</code>  &lt;- This paragraph was asked to insert friends "for weight." <br>  Yesterday I was visited by the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãhow to give green light to startups, make this world a better place, control the quality of the code of applications appearing in the world. <br>  Reading this article will not take more than 15 minutes, but I really want you to read carefully.  Reading fascinates (as it seems to me and my friends), and does not create a mental load ( <b>no formulas, no code, no technologies</b> ).  Talk about non-financial investing in projects. <br>  <u><b>In short:</b> I am an expert in my field, I have free time.</u>  <u>How do I invest in projects that I‚Äôm interested in running?</u> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Crowd sourcing </h4><br>  I will not describe this scheme in detail, an example is widely known - the world of open source. <br>  With one exception, that this design scheme can sometimes have closed code.  For example, in a somewhat distorted situation - when freelancers are hired for a project. <br>  There are a lot of advantages here, in case of payment: <br><ul><li>  A person is passionate about his business, he is an order of magnitude more responsible for his tasks, performs in a short time (in terms of number of tasks / working time. As a result, a couple of hours are spent per week, speed is lower), he finds extraordinary solutions and all the time ( <b>including non-working !!!</b> ) thinks how to improve the code. </li><li>  Need much less pay: <br><ul><li>  no transportation costs </li><li>  schedule is completely free </li><li>  he can eat homemade food, and not spend money on expensive cafes </li><li>  just because he loves his job and is ready to work for free </li></ul></li><li>  No need to pay for the office, the office is simply not needed, everyone works at home. </li></ul><br>  <b>Note:</b> in this article I will not talk about the minuses, as this can scare away.  For they only sound scary, but with a skillful approach to business, they get nothing.  The whole problem is that they are formulated as follows: it will be <b>very bad</b> if you do not provide for / check <b>this</b> .  For example: there will be a bad quality of the code if not to assign responsible, schoolchildren will write and different modules will work separately. ( <u>Unfortunately, most of the problems formulate this: there <i>will be a bad quality of the code</i> .</u> ) <br><br><h4>  Crowd funding </h4><br><h5>  Customer engagement </h5><br>  I think many of you know what crowd funding is in the world of software development.  For those who do not know - a bunch of fans of the game ( <i>we put a million</i> ) get together and everyone gives $ 10 as a pre-order ( <i>invests development</i> ).  As a result, in several months the developer delivers a new game with a budget of 10 million dollars. <br>  There are obvious advantages in this scheme: <br><ul><li>  All the profits from the project went to the developer, and not a drop to the investor ( <i>usually he is given 30-70%</i> ).  This is the key to further development of the company. </li><li>  The developer is not afraid to spend all the amount he has on the development - he will not go bankrupt.  In fact, he has already spent it, just the events are mixed in time. </li><li>  Developed only those programs that are required by the people.  Since the people become an investor ( <i>and non-legal holder of the product‚Äôs shares</i> ), they get a vote on what decision to make.  Improve balance?  Performance?  Add a new race / hero / weapon?  Support new language?  Only problems that are topical for the majority are being developed, although the priority of correcting minority‚Äôs critical errors is always higher, which is why they are critical. </li></ul>

    <h5>  First success </h5><br>  What happens in the case of collecting the necessary amount in the case of software development, for example, a game?  This money goes to: <br><ul><li>  office rent </li><li>  payment programmers </li><li>  payment artists / designers </li><li>  payment of musicians </li><li>  payment of someone else who is needed for this game, for example, actors </li><li>  advertising ( <i>usually not required after, if you earned on crowd funding you know millions</i> ) </li></ul><br>  Accordingly, all this money is spent on business, leaving several thousand to the "pillow", in the case of force majeure. <br><br>  <i>My idea unites these two worlds, and connecting only pluses and where it is possible absorbing the minuses of each other.</i> <i><br></i>  <i><u>For example, if the funds for kickstarter are not enough, the project will not start.</u></i>  <i><u>But if there are less than 10 people, the project will still be launched, but it will be completed a little later.</u></i> <br><br><h4>  Code venture </h4><br><h5>  Reasons for creating </h5><br><h6>  Is it all about the money? </h6><br>  You are a programmer and a fan of the game.  Let's say this is Diablo.  You really want to release the next version, you invest your $ 10. <br>  The company has programmers, excellent programmers, but they are not necessarily fans of the game.  For your $ 10 they will work an hour, at the rate of what they get $ 2000 per month (they are really good programmers). <br>  Now suppose that you, a game fan, are lucky to get a job at this company.  And it depends on how quickly you write your site depends on how quickly the new version will be released.  How much are you ready to earn for $ 10?  Hour?  Two?  Yes, I am sure you are ready to work for free (or very cheap), so long as it happens sooner.  Overtime, around the clock, you would be double if you could (I would have done just that). <br>  If the company says that it cannot pay the next salary and becomes bankrupt, what happens, will you leave?  <b><u>The hell of a two, you stay there and work</u></b> for free, and maybe even <a href="http://www.kinopoisk.ru/film/432724/">borrow your savings</a> to pay for office rent.  And the rest, not fans?  That's right, they will leave, they initially worked for the money. <br><br><h6>  If there is no experience? </h6><br>  One person had a great idea (the <a href="http://lurkmore.to/%25D0%259A%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B"><b>essence is to rob cows and all that</b></a> ), but he has absolutely no experience in software development.  And the more people management, coordination of this development.  ( <i>And maybe funds?</i> ) <br>  The only way to launch a product is to donate your product to an outsource.  Moreover, at the same time, he either completely loses the copyright, receiving a small compensation.  Either receives minor shares, with voting rights below 1%.  He can no longer influence the direction of development, even if he has a hundred improvements, they are all dead. <br>  Now let's imagine a company ( <i>Code Venture</i> ) that specializes in developing other people's software, without funding ( <i>or with minimal, which seems more like the truth</i> ) for the idea. <br>  ( <i>Formally speaking, this is called investing time, labor</i> ) <br>  In this case, all project participants, without exception, will respect the author of the idea ( <b>Linus Torvalds</b> ), and he will have every right to decide what should be implemented further, taking into account the needs of users of course.  This is an obvious plus on the path of progress - obviously dead ideas get the right to life. <br><br><h4>  Why do I think that will work out? </h4><br>  On an equal footing with the main work, I constantly start up.  But I never thought of anything global.  Small projects, but one may interest you. <br>  Internet radio, back in 2009, when it was not yet widespread.  We were 10 people of the backbone, we worked for 3 years, with a permanent schedule and broadcasting.  No one received any money, and no one planned it.  We were happy giving emotions to listeners.  The first unformatted radio ( <i>as far as I know</i> ) in the world.  Our airs were as diverse as all floating in the ocean. <br><br><h6>  And what happens? </h6><br>  I plan to create a community of programmers that will eventually become comparable to the linux community.  The full coordination structure is present, and differs from the well-known / generally accepted. <br>  When a new idea appears in the system that needs investments, all participants, without exception, take part in voting.  The priority is given to the leaders of the divisions, based on the load, the level of experience of the participants and other, necessarily objective judgments (the leaders' assessment will be with a mandatory detailed comment). <br>  <i><b>I'm not going to give myself a dime of profit from the resulting projects</b> , as some might have thought (and even thought already).</i>  <i>This community is extremely similar to open source, with the exception that it is not a society that is formed alongside the project, but projects that are being formed in society.</i>  <i>Profit is distributed in the same way as donate in open-source systems.</i> <br><br><h5>  Quality code </h5><br>  It is no secret that many students with burning eyes and <s>crooked hands with</s> no experience go to such projects.  Most of them are only enough to shout or write simple code ( <b>but not all!</b> ).  On the exhaust zero, but they are generators of ideas.  It is very important! <br>  One person for 10 students is enough for this team to work as 3-4 good programmers.  ( <i>Numbers from the ceiling and without statistics, only on the experience of working with students</i> ).  And in a good team, interested in the quality of each frame, they quickly rise, faster than in an ordinary office. <br>  But suppose that society exists for several years.  Every month a new challenge, a new sphere.  Hundreds of libraries, hundreds of modules created within the project.  This allows you to quickly solve such problems, without buying third-party libraries and the cost of developing their own. <br>  A large number of goals allows you to create <b><u>complex decisions</u></b> in a matter of weeks ( <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A0%25D0%25B0%25D1%2581%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5_%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BC">where it is possible, of course</a> ), and dedication and devotion to your ‚Äúbrainchild‚Äù <b><u>makes</u></b> them <b><u>ideal</u></b> ( <i>if there are people with significant work experience</i> ). <br>  In any case, I think you understand, the problem is solved, and it seems to me <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A3%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F">epic</a> . <br><br><h5>  What's next? </h5><br><ul><li>  I hope that if it is successful, artists, animators, musicians, lawyers, accountants, managers and the like will appear in our team.  We will become one big family and will be able to take on all the development from start to finish.  We will become an outsource company. </li><li>  I hope that favorable conditions for developing an idea ( <i>one step from an idea to a product, no samples and millions are needed</i> ) will allow us to become an incubator of new accomplishments, move progress far ahead. </li><li>  I believe that if a large amount of software will be developed in one community, the code will be unified everywhere, and the products are compatible with each other.  This will allow one application to support hundreds of programs, and quickly respond to changes in formats, fixes vulnerabilities. </li><li>  The distance from the ‚Äúrelease of the new chip‚Äù to the ‚Äúimplementation of support in all modules‚Äù will be reduced to the minimum possible time, and negotiations on the support formats will become more loyal. </li></ul><br><br><h4>  Landing </h4><br>  Dreamed and that's enough, in fact it's all an empty sound.  It is beautiful, memorable, original.  Hopefully will be echoed from mouth to mouth, but it is sound.  There is nothing behind it, as there was no linux word. <br><br>  I believe that if the world is inhabited by talented people, and among them there are those who want to sincerely make it better, and that sooner or later they will gather together and turn over all the foundations here.  I went on stage with a performance, my time is up.  Let me take my leave and go backstage, now it's your turn to go under the spotlight. <br><br>  <i>There are no barriers to perfection but weak faith.</i>  <i>¬©</i> <br><hr><br><br>  <u>I ask you to spend time on constructive criticism, impersonal minuses will not help to improve the idea.</u>  <u>It is important for me to know your attitude.</u>  I also ask you to forgive my ability to communicate, they understand me from the first time only through the code. <br><br>  This is still an idea, concept, my vision of the progress and evolution of the world of development.  It was created under the influence of <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2590%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BC%25D1%2583%25D1%2581">the Anonymous community</a> , <a href="http://kickstarter.com/">kickstarter</a> , the <a href="http://www.linuxfoundation.org/content/how-participate-linux-community">linux community</a> , the <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A5%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D1%2586%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D1%258C">hacker movement</a> , the <a href="http://www.ozon.ru/context/detail/id/5626260/">history of the company Zappos</a> and the <a href="http://rusini.org/">Russian kickstarter</a> , it was in it that the investment of time was offered. <br><br>  <b>UPD:</b> One smart man wrote <br>  "And let's all professionals, let's get together, <br>  and start free Krivorukov code <br>  creative startups, <br>  who can‚Äôt do anything themselves, will almost certainly lead to negative evaluations.  :) <br><br>  Again, this is how linux began. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/152641/">https://habr.com/ru/post/152641/</a></p>
