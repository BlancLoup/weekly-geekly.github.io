How to verify that the firewall is configured securely enough?  Do I need a streaming antivirus and does the IPS work?  Is the mail secure?  As a rule, to solve such questions, it is suggested to perform a Penetration Test.  However, it is either too expensive or too difficult (if done by oneself), and such a deep analysis is not always needed.  Fortunately, there are online resources that allow you to carry out basic checks of your protection (mainly the firewall and anti-virus protection).  Of course, this cannot replace a full-fledged PenTest, but it gives an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãhow protected your network is from the simplest and at the same time the most common types of attacks. <br><br>  If you are interested in this topic, then welcome under the cat ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Check Point CheckMe - Instant Security Check</b> <br>  I would like to start a review with a tool that makes a comprehensive analysis of the security level of your firewall (be it UTM or NGFW).  This is <a href="http://www.cpcheckme.com/checkme/%3Fsource%3DTssolution">Check Point CheckMe</a> .

The test is not as complex and in a general sense, it checks various ways of delivering a test virus (eicar).  The possibility of downloading the eicar file in open form, in the form of archives of various degrees of nesting (archive in the archive - up to 10 degrees of nesting) is checked.  There are several types of archives: zip, rar, tar, cab, 7zip.  There is also a password-protected archive.  By the results you can see with what type of threats your systems fail. <br><br>  <a href="http://metal.fortiguard.com/">Run the Fortinet test</a> <br><br>  <b>HTTPS archived Eicar</b> <br><br>  Almost most antivirus tests use the Eicar file.  Therefore, you can not access third-party services (many do not trust vendor tests) and use the <a href="http://www.eicar.org/85-0-Download.html">eicar.org</a> site <a href="http://www.eicar.org/85-0-Download.html">directly</a> . <br><br>  Here we can also download a test file and the following options are possible: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/452/dbf/dee/452dbfdee57a4088baa4b6b6d742664d.PNG"><br><br>  As you can see, there is an eicar file in open form, in the form of an archive.  A distinctive feature is the ability to download a file via the https protocol.  Those.  if your firewall (whether Cisco, CheckPoint, Fortinet and any other) is not configured to https inspection, then the file will be downloaded without any problems.  It will probably be blocked by the operating system (at least in Winodws 10), but this is already a serious ‚Äúbell‚Äù because  Most modern resources have long since switched to https, which means that without an https inspection, your security tools simply do not see anything and will pass viruses like water through a sieve. <br><br>  <b>Online sandboxes (sandbox)</b> <br><br>  I will not consider in detail the question ‚ÄúWhat is a sandbox?‚Äù, Especially since a little later we will devote a small series of articles to this.  The main task of sandboxes is to run the file and see what happens after that.  According to the results, a verdict about the harmfulness of this file.  Sandboxes help fight against malicious programs that ordinary antiviruses do not define.  There are several online services where you can check files in the sandbox: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://threatemulation.checkpoint.com/teb/upload.jsp">CheckPoint SandBlast</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.threatexpert.com/submit.aspx">Threatexpert</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://www.vicheck.ca/">ViCheck</a> </li></ul><br>  These services are very useful for checking your streaming antivirus.  For example, you can download some virus file in Tor-networks, run it through your antivirus (better on the layout, and not in the work environment) and check it in the online sandbox.  Then compare the results and make sure that anti-virus protection is no longer enough. <br><br>  <b>Online antivirus</b> <br><br>  There could be dozens of links, because  almost every self-respecting antivirus has an online scanner.  However, almost all of these links can be replaced with one - <a href="https://www.virustotal.com/ru/">VirusTotal</a> <br><br>  The resource allows you to scan files and links for the subject of infection.  In this analysis is performed using a variety of antiviruses and you can see the verdict for each of them. <br>  The url checker is very interesting.  With it, you can check the effectiveness of your Proxy or means of protecting Web-traffic.  Find a viral site, check it in virustotal, and then see if it opens through your proxy. <br><br>  <b>Online Firewall and Port Scanners</b> <br>  These tools can also come in handy when testing your network: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="http://www.hackerwatch.org/probe/">Hackerwatch</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.t1shopper.com/tools/port-scan/">T1shopper</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://pentest-tools.com/network-vulnerability-scanning/tcp-port-scanner-online-nmap">TCP Port Scan with Nmap</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://mxtoolbox.com/PortScan.aspx">MXToolbox</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://hackertarget.com/nmap-online-port-scanner/">Hackertarget</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://en.dnstools.ch/port-scan.html">DNS Tools</a> </li></ul><br>  <b>Online Anti-spam and Email Security Scanners</b> <br><br>  <a href="http://www.emailsecuritycheck.net/index.html">EmailSecurityCheck</a> <br>  This resource will check the security of your mail server.  For this, several emails with test virus files will be sent, which are packaged in various ways.  If you have received any of these letters, then this is a reason to think about the security of your email server. <br><br>  <b>What's next?</b> <br><br>  Using the above services, you can draw some conclusions regarding the effectiveness of existing remedies.  Pay attention not only to the effectiveness of protection, but also to the incident detection process.  You should be as informed as possible about all IS events.  This is achieved either with the help of embedded tools (email alert, dashboard devices, etc.) or third-party (SIEM or Log-managment systems). <br><br>  The next logical step is to conduct a network security audit.  This can be done both with CheckPoint and with Fortinet, and for free.  More information about this can be found <a href="http://tssolution.ru/check-point-security-check-up/">here</a> and <a href="http://tssolution.ru/fortinet/">here</a> .  We have already partially described the <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/tssolution/blog/323606/">architecture of Check Point solutions</a> and in the following posts we will describe how to use it to make a free network security audit. <br><br>  PS If you use Check Point, but the test is still not passed, then you can see how to strengthen your defense, so to speak, ‚Äútighten the screws‚Äù. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/323896/">https://habr.com/ru/post/323896/</a></p>
