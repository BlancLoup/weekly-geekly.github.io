At first glance, these bugs have nothing in common, as they concern different platforms: Android, iOS, macOS, Windows, Linux.

Examples of these vulnerabilities include: <br><br><ul><li>  type mismatch </li><li>  buffer overflow </li><li>  integer variable overflow </li><li>  use after free vulnerability </li></ul><br>  A type mismatch can occur when a code segment does not check the type of the object passed to it and uses it blindly.  This situation can be dangerous.  In addition, together with the type mismatch, incorrect function pointers or incorrect data are associated with the wrong part of the code, which in some cases can lead to its execution. <br><br>  Buffer overflow (or "English" buffer overflow ") is a critical security vulnerability that occurs when a user enters a string that will be in an array of undersized characters.  This results in writing data outside the memory area allocated for the array.  HeartBleed, for example, which had an impact on 17% of secure servers on the Internet, was a buffer overflow vulnerability that could read 60KB after the end of the list, including passwords and other user data. <br><br>  Overflowing of integer variables is a hard-to-find vulnerability that exploits the fact that numbers cannot exceed a certain value, which depends on the number of bits used to represent them, and the encoding method. <br><br>  The use after free vulnerability usually occurs when using a pointer or in-memory data when the pointer (or block of memory) is already released. <br><br>  Together, these vulnerabilities are exploits that are most commonly found in popular software, such as Firefox, Chrome, Windows, Android, or iOS.  Gaynor has already counted at least 400 and claims: ‚ÄúI have followed the security of these projects for over a year, and in almost all versions of these products more than half of the vulnerabilities are‚Äú memory unsafety ‚Äù.  And even more alarming is that severe and critical vulnerabilities [...] almost always have this type. ‚Äù <br><br>  Despite the significant risks associated with software security that they support, ‚Äúmemory unsafety friendly‚Äù programming languages, such as C or C ++, are still used by developers, while proven alternatives, such as Rust, Swift, that can be considered as languages ‚Äã‚Äã"memory safe", are rare. <br><br>  This may be due to the fact that for a new project, developers usually choose a programming language based on languages ‚Äã‚Äãthat their team knows, performance, and library systems that can flow from this choice.  When making decisions, the security component associated with this is almost never considered, or at least is considered insufficiently, Gaynor believes. <br><br>  In addition, most software projects, even the most important ones for Internet security, are not new.  They were launched ten years ago, if not more.  Linux, OpenSSL and the Apache web server, for example, for more than twenty years.  For large-scale projects like these, rewriting all the code in a new language is not an option.  They must be transformed gradually, which means that projects must be written and saved in two different languages ‚Äã‚Äãinstead of one.  It also implies the need to form a large team, which takes a lot of time and requires more funds. <br><br>  The biggest problem, finally, is connected with the fact that many developers do not believe at all that the problem exists.  They believe that the problem is not that languages ‚Äã‚Äãsuch as C or C ++ contribute to the emergence of vulnerabilities, but in other programmers who write code with errors.  They believe that there are no problems with these supposedly ‚Äúmemory unsafety friendly‚Äù languages, because no code is perfect, people simply do not know how to use them. <br><br>  And what do you think about this? <br><br><hr><br>  I note that the sound criticism of the translation is also welcome. <br><br>  Thanks for attention! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/432502/">https://habr.com/ru/post/432502/</a></p>
