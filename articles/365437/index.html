  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Curiosity Mars Rover, home winery and other gadgets from MediaTek Labs members at GEEK PICNIC</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  A very young, but promising project for developers <b><a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/mediatek/blog/242685/">MediaTek Labs</a></b> became the official sponsor of <b><a href="http://msk.geek-picnic.ru/">GEEK PICNIC</a></b> - the famous Russian technology festival and not only.  Obviously, MediaTek itself could show many interesting technologies at such an event that promise to appear in the flagship chipsets.  For example, shooting video at 480 fps or phase autofocus technology, which has never been seen on smartphones before.  But what can the Russians show MediaTek Labs?  As it turned out, no less interesting things. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/874/de5/5b1/874de55b1e624d438a6207f02b1afce1.jpg"></div><a name="habracut"></a><br>  A little help for those who have forgotten what MediaTek Labs is.  This is a successful online platform where MediaTek invites all novice developers to design gadgets, more precisely, gadgets of the ‚Äúwearable electronics‚Äù or ‚ÄúInternet of things‚Äù category.  Of course, calling for a reason, and with the prospect of time to notice and develop the most interesting projects.  Admittedly, the company manages to do this quite well - we will tell about the projects themselves below, and in general there are already more than 6,000 participants in Labs, and the community does not even have a year.  What is most surprising, the share of Russian-speaking developers is already 16% and continues to grow. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/36d/568/0e1/36d5680e12c34feca16b397c7d9d6d0b.png"></div><br>  Now a little about GEEK PICNIC.  Probably every third inhabitant of both capitals at least once heard about this festival.  In short, the first two years of GEEK PICNIC was exactly what it was called - a small local get-together for developers, which was held on summer days in Moscow and St. Petersburg.  In recent years, the "picnic" has evolved into a powerful parade of technology and art.  To assess the scale of the event, suffice it to say that last year the festival‚Äôs headliners were, in particular, Anatoly Wasserman and Nigel Oakland, world-famous owner of a bionic prosthetic arm.

Guests of the event will be able to examine in detail the most interesting projects created by the participants of MediaTek Labs over the past few months.  By tradition, or rather, according to the Labs project regulations, all devices are created on the LinkIt ONE mockup platform with an integrated MediaTek Aster chip and wide connectivity capabilities for individual sensors and components.  It is the latter that allows participants to create gadgets that are so different in concept and scope. <br><br>  <b>Weather Station.</b>  As the name implies, this portable weather station measures the meteorological data and uploads it to the cloud, which is the proprietary platform MediaTek Cloud Sandbox (MCS), a new in-house service for all Labs participants.  It allows you to store arrays of data at all stages of the development of the prototype.  Through MCS, the user sees the process of collecting weather information in real time and can monitor the station remotely directly via the web console or Android application. <br><br>  <b>Smart Brewer.</b>  But this device can reveal its potential at the festival in all its glory, since its purpose is to control the process of fermentation of wine.  In other words, we are nothing but a wine barrel of the 21st century.  In this configuration, LinkIt ONE is equipped with sensors for atmospheric pressure, temperature, ethanol vapor, an acidity meter, and a sensor that detects carbon dioxide levels ‚Äî that is, everything needed to successfully prepare a bottle of wine in a literal sense.  Like other developments, it is possible to control the fermentation process through MCS, and another device that looks like a carafe can communicate with Android smartphones using BT 4.0 and is equipped with wireless charging. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cb4/d32/0c5/cb4d320c532a49f8b12b257c4d1af82c.jpg"></div><br>  <b>Smart Light.</b>  By itself, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãsmart light in a smart home is not new - for several years now Philips and several other companies have been offering their ready-made solutions in this field.  But, perhaps, for the first time, such a device is created on a democratic component base, and even with a large prospect of increasing functionality.  Now this LED lamp can generate several hundred shades and, of course, is fully controlled remotely through the MediaTek Cloud Sandbox. <br><br>  <b>Autonomous robot.</b>  This compact descendant of the rover Curiosity is committed to photographing the surrounding space and processing images right on board by the LinkIt ONE board.  The power of the chipset and the sophistication of the algorithms is enough to recognize the color of objects, as well as to estimate the distance and their position in space. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e7f/f95/a73/e7ff95a73e104a9385041b9ec527b97b.jpg"></div><br>  <b>Linked Home.</b>  Remote home monitoring system and automation of some household processes.  The system can signal to the ‚Äúcloud‚Äù in response to user-configurable scenarios, for example: opening windows, smoke, high temperature or humidity, a surge in power consumption, and much more.  In addition, the system allows you to control lighting, heating, ventilation and household electrical appliances.  In addition to monitoring via Wi-Fi, the user can enable and disable household appliances and configure sensors via SMS. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e6c/2ce/a84/e6c2cea8493d41c2bcfdc530f7db5064.jpg"></div><br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ec3/6d4/ce9/ec36d4ce9bd3460083157bbff9382d83.jpg"></div><br>  For obvious reasons, MediaTek Labs does not disclose all the cards in advance and probably has a few more projects up its sleeve, for which the GEEK PICNIC site will become, in fact, the site of the official premiere.  But what is even more interesting, the format of the presence of Labs at the event is not limited to the exhibition functions - Labs promises to bring several of its key speakers, which will give master classes on creating gadgets based on MediaTek solutions from scratch.  By and large, this is a unique case when a potential developer can skip several steps and immediately become interested in one of the most promising venture IT-platforms in South-East Asia with his project.

Yes, for me. <br><br>  Our previous publications: <br><br>  ¬ª <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/mediatek/blog/247306/">Review of the Lenovo P70: an eight-core processor, a 4,000 mAh battery and five days of battery life</a> <br>  ¬ª <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/mediatek/blog/246680/">Tablet chipset on the most productive architecture: presented by MediaTek MT8173</a> <br>  ¬ª <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/mediatek/blog/246666/">300 million dollars for startups: MediaTek Ventures investment fund opened</a> <br>  ¬ª <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/mediatek/blog/245852/">Russian developers conquer MediaTek Labs</a> <br>  ¬ª <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/mediatek/blog/246614/">Eight 64-bit cores and LTE: MediaTek MT6753 chipset introduced</a> <br>  ¬ª <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/mediatek/blog/246416/">Just5 Blaster: anti-crisis smartphone with not a budget filling</a> <br>  " <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/mediatek/blog/246320/">MediaTek and Android Wear: smart watches are becoming easier and more accessible</a> <br>  ¬ª <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/mediatek/blog/245052/">Review of the tablet Alcatel One Touch Hero 8 D820x: 8 cores, metal, LTE and French roots</a> <br>  "A <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/mediatek/blog/244958/">week with a watch-phone: how I exploited Omate TrueSmart on the MediaTek chipset</a> <br>  ¬ª <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/mediatek/blog/244652/">Smartphones 2015: new technologies according to MediaTek</a> <br><br>  Have a good weekend! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/365437/">https://habr.com/ru/post/365437/</a></p>
