      In it, we focused on tools for scientific programming.  Perhaps the main and long-awaited feature of this release is <b>IPython Notebook</b> support right in PyCharm: <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/318/756/e34/318756e3411143b4b192cd1be7aa5e0a.png"><br><br>  Now all actions familiar to IPython Notebook can be performed directly in the IDE.  Different types of cells are supported, it is possible to run them separately and see the results of the execution, including graphics, right in the editor!  Of course, some things are not yet supported, but in general, everything is already working perfectly. <br><br>  The question arises: what is the point of using IPython Notebook inside PyCharm instead of regular IPython?  The answer is simple: in addition to the basic IPython Notebook functionality, PyCharm provides autocompletion, navigation, hints, and other features typical of smart and smart IDE.  We just took and combined the advantages of both PyCharm-based approaches. <br><br>  Another addition to the piggy bank of the scientific component of PyCharm 4 functionality is the <b>NumPy</b> graphical viewer: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a66/4cc/81d/a664cc81dcf0419c808ca579c35885c0.png"><br><br>  At the same time, we added improved support for code written using the <b>NumPy</b> library, and included <b>matplotlib</b> support in the integrated Python console.  In the future, we plan to develop support for research libraries and tools. <br><br>  Developing applications in PyCharm 4 has become even more efficient thanks to the special support of the <b>BDD</b> tools <b>(Behavior-Driven Development)</b> : <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/eec/7b1/429/eec7b1429b334f7e8e571db39849d6d4.png"><br><br>  PyCharm fully supports the two most popular BDD development tools ‚Äî <b>behave</b> and <b>lettuce</b> .  The IDE understands your textual requirements on Gherkin, recognizes the compliance of textual requirements and their implementation in the code, allows you to quickly navigate between them, helps not only to automatically create and modify tests, but also to work effectively with them.  Test run results are presented in a convenient graphical form, so that you can easily view the results and navigate through them. <br><br>  Back in PyCharm 4, we seriously improved the <b>debugger</b> .  First of all, we combined the PyCharm debugger code with the code from the original PyDev repository.  This means that work is now being done on a single code, and improvements from both the PyCharm and PyDev teams are immediately transferred to the common repository.  Thanks to this merge and active work on a new debugger, PyCharm 4 is now <b>able to join the running process</b> : <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4ae/ff1/dec/4aeff1decc074a44a5b82c6d4f9f240d.png"><br><br>  After joining, all the familiar functions available from the PyCharm debugger become available.  You can walk through breakpoints, view and change the values ‚Äã‚Äãof variables and objects.  In general - all without any restrictions.  Note that all this is available on any platform. <br><br>  In addition, from the debugger, you can view the <b>scheme of calls to any object</b> in a special window while debugging your code: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bae/1f5/c2c/bae1f5c2c9b44b98937ba34a6645ad97.png"><br><br>  There is one more useful improvement: the PyCharm debugger started working with <b>Jinja2 templates</b> in the same way as with Django templates: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e93/153/04f/e9315304f19a44c9b8561d2e406b08c3.png"><br><br>  Everything is not limited to this, in PyCharm 4 there are a number of important improvements: <br><ul><li>  Improved Python / Django console window </li><li>  the ability to automatically leave the console active after starting the project in order to save the context and continue working in it; </li><li>  viewing the tree of calls to methods; </li><li>  improved package management system; </li><li>  unittest subtests support for Python 3.4; </li><li>  new project creation wizard. </li></ul><br><br>  In addition to Python-specific things, new PyCharm 4 absorbed improvements from WebStorm 9, for example, Gulp integration, as well as improvements from IntelliJ platform, on which all our products are based, including IntelliJ IDEA 14. In PyCharm, an improved UI appeared in the settings IDE and when creating a project, recognizing the style of the code in separate files, as well as a smart backspace, which takes into account these styles, improved multi-mode editing mode and much more. <br><br>  By the way, if you missed <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/JetBrains/blog/242103/">this news</a> , in October 2014, the JetBrains product line was replenished with an unusual modification of our Python IDE - <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm-educational/">PyCharm Educational Edition</a> .  This is a free edition of PyCharm with open source software that is specifically designed for people who want to learn programming effectively, as well as teachers who want to create courses based on PyCharm using interactive exercises.
