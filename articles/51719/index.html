      And it all began very rosy.  Somewhere in the summer, ZAO TD ‚ÄúOreol-Zik‚Äù began installing GPS navigators on our trams, with the goal of later collecting data from them and, processing them, communicating to the people.  I must say the idea is not new in itself, that it is time for GPS navigators to be put into public transport by any person who is well versed in modern technologies, but Oreol-Zik was the first to decide on implementation.  To do this, the director Dmitry Tretelnitsky decided to take out a loan of 6 million rubles, having calculated that the service should pay off in a year. <br><br><h4>  Go </h4><br>  Somewhere in October, the service was launched by the people, and it was here that it turned out that everything was beautiful only in words.  Many were concerned primarily with the money question, that is, how much does it cost to find out the necessary information?  To say that I was in shock means to say nothing, because in the end ‚Äúafter conducting surveys‚Äù Oreol-ZIK company calculated that the optimal cost of one request to their service is 9 rubles, ‚Äúit is available to students and pensioners "- With these words, they explained such a" low "cost.  It turned out that in order to find out when the tram arrives, the fare in which, by the way, costs 10 rubles, you need to pay another 9, well, in the amount of 19. Do I have to say that at the fare in fixed-route taxis (Gazelle, Bogdana), who go often enough, go fast and, most importantly, in the winter they are not so cold, even students and grandmothers, who are 9 rubles - ‚Äúreally reasonable price‚Äù, will prefer 20 rubles to tram them. <br><br>  It is unlikely that the Oreol-Zik enterprise thought about how people would use their service.  Probably, they saw it like this: a person sends an SMS in advance to find out when to go to a stop.  Habralyudi, throw a stone at me, if one of you (at least someone) would do that?  Personally, I think that we, Russians, will first hope for Russian, and we will get to a stop (‚ÄúWhy would I throw extra 9 rubles, if suddenly my tram quickly arrives?‚Äù), And then, if there is no tram for a long time, we‚Äôll ask the main question is "Where is the tram?".  And here lies the second mistake of designers, which I will explain with an example: imagine that it is -10 and windy on the street, you are standing more than 10 minutes at the bus stop.  Coldly?  And near the kiosk, at which kind aunt the saleswoman wrote "We are heated on the street!".  If you have an alternative in the form of other transport, then most likely you will go and sit on it.  The exception in this case will be the owners of travel cards, but given that we have only two small sections in the city, on which only one transport route goes, the travel owners will travel on the first tram with transfers. <br><br><h4>  Money can not buy happiness! </h4><br>  Well, let's drop the money and related issues, let's say that we decided to use the service and find out where our tram is, as I did from the interest (it was somewhere in early January).  So, my situation: there are trams 200 meters away from me (an accident on the road), among them is the one I need.  I wondered what the system would answer, and at the same time it was interesting to find out if there are any other necessary trams nearby.  I send SMS and get ...: "20:00 K szhln, trm.  for 5 left  No GDETRAM.RU Moscow (in South-Zapa ‚Äù. (This is not a mistake, it is exactly what is written in quotes) <br><br>  <i>Retreat: when the mobile operator Motiv began its work in Nizhny Tagil, they offered the testers free of charge to talk on the phone for as long as possible for the month, if only they reported about work failures.</i> <br><br>  So what did I get?  And I received that the service does not work!  In a good way, I don‚Äôt ** 9 rubles.  And the advertisement of this scam hangs at every stop.  The testing example was not in vain, because, starting up its service, in Aura-Zik, they missed the test operation phase, calling the first three months of the system operation as test operation and ripping off money.  At first you generally could receive messages that there are no trams equipped with GPS nearby.  By the way, in the leaflet, which hangs at the stops, it says ‚ÄúRelevance of information 6-8 stops‚Äù, but for some reason, the answer has already written to me about 5. <br><br>  But I was not surprised that already being started up service does not work.  And what else can you expect from a company with a stupid name "Oreol-ZIK" (yes, I have a prejudice that the firm is not capable of anything, even if it cannot invent a normal name for itself)?  Having dug deeper, I discovered that a professional ... dancer is programming this service!  No, I have nothing against the dancers, but for some reason I hardly see the programmer-dancer, especially the professional in both cases.  It‚Äôs perilous to chase two hares, and the fact that one person runs the whole business is clearly not good.  In addition, the only program that this programmer-dancer has written is ‚Äú <a href="http://www.autoskating.ru/Autoskating/index.html">The Avtoskating-4 Tournament Management System</a> ‚Äù, which he has been writing and supporting for 15 years already!  Considering how often the patches come out (on average 2-3 per month) to this system, there is no need to talk about quality <br><br><h4>  It turns out we all live wrong </h4><br>  When I wrote this article a month ago (safely then having abandoned until better times, the article turned out not on emotions once, but carefully thought out) I didn‚Äôt suspect that I‚Äôm not the only one who, despite the proximity of the tram, was told that he wasn‚Äôt there .  An explanation on this issue appeared on the system website: <br><br>  <i>For those who send messages like</i> <i><br></i>  <i>"13:00 GDETRAM.RU Stop such and such:"</i> <i><br></i>  <i>This server did not find trams from 1 to 5 stops from the place of request, but found a signal from a tram that is about to come up, or has just moved away from the stop (not to distinguish it from afar).</i>  <i>Therefore, the message that he did not find trams at all, the server did not give, and &lt;1 stop in response does not turn on, because</i>  <i>There is a high probability that he has already proceeded.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>The bug is now fixed.</i>  <i>From 23.01 the server will take into account this feature and issue the answer ‚Äúnot found‚Äù.</i> <br><br>  So, we get a super precision system.  Instead of writing something like ‚Äúthe tram is somewhere near you‚Äù, they say ‚Äúnot found‚Äù!  And if I am standing around the corner and do not see a tram, then having received ‚Äúnot found‚Äù ... I think further to say something unnecessary! <br><br><h4>  All too bad </h4><br>  In this service, everything is so bad that most of how it is implemented, I do not even want to discuss.  No information about whether a tram is in a traffic jam or broken, as stated in the slogan, you naturally do not come.  Moreover, the message does not come to you after how many minutes your tram arrives, but how many stops it is before yours (by the way, this number is not more than 5, since it doesn‚Äôt know how to calculate the service), leaving all temporary calculations to your brain.  Service servers are <a href="http://gdetram.ru/index.php%3Fpage%3Dnews">constantly falling</a> for unexplained reasons.  But then, at every stop and in every tram, there are leaflets of this ‚Äúbreakthrough‚Äù in the field of high technologies. <br><br><h4>  He laughs well who ... </h4><br>  I don‚Äôt know about you, but I‚Äôm offended that all this cotovasia was started with only one purpose - to cut the dough.  Most of the 6 million went not to high-quality programming, but to advertise the service in order to cut down more money from an unsuspecting people ... It's a pity! <br><br><ul><li>  Service site: <a href="http://gdetram.ru/">gdetram.ru</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://dkvartal.ru/news/2777394">Article about the service in the Business Quarter</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://forum.tr.ru/read.php%3F12,753645">Discussion of the</a> service on the forum "Transport of Yekaterinburg" and reviews tried. </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/51719/">https://habr.com/ru/post/51719/</a></p>
