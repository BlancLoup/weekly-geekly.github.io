      To become a user, it is enough to register on the mail.ru portal.  This means that if you already have a mailing address on mail.ru, then you can start using the project. <br>  Users ask questions, get answers to them, vote for the best answer, and, if they wish, comment.  No less interesting is the use of surveys. <br>  Each user has his own piggy bank of points.  When you first enter the project on this wallet is charged 100 points.  Later they can be spent, recruited, but more on that below.  There is also a separate ranking on the efficiency of the project (efficiency).  This ratio reflects the ratio of the user's best answers to the number of all his answers. <br>  The project positions itself as the ‚ÄúHuman search for questions and answers.‚Äù <br>  Each user has his own "Personal Account", where you can see his detailed activity statistics (similar to our Habracenter).  About the personal account will also be written later. <br>  It should be noted that the more a participant has points and the higher his status, the more opportunities he has. <br>  I think you get the gist of the system.  So let's continue. <br><br><h4>  Points system </h4><br>  Entry to the project is awarded 1 point (once a day). <br>  For users, there is a system of levels (statuses) that depends on points and efficiency: a novice, a student, a connoisseur, a pro, a master, a guru, a thinker, a sage, an enlightened one, an oracle, a genius, artificial intelligence and a higher mind. <br>  For creating a question or poll, 5 points are deducted from a participant of any level.  This is a fixed figure on the project. <br>  But for the creation of the answer to the participant on the contrary - points are added.  The number of points for the answer depends on the current efficiency of the user - up to 5 points. <br>  Such actions of users as creation of the comment to the answer, voting for an interesting question or answer and other unimportant actions are not evaluated. <br>  It is clear that the scoring system is designed in such a way as to encourage the user to answer questions more often.  This is logical. <br>  Now about each action in more detail. <br><br><h4>  Questions </h4><br>  A question can be asked from any page of the project by clicking on the beautiful button ‚ÄúAsk!‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/131/6f8/137/1316f8137780fa70c9c38fda08085031.png" alt="image"><br>  It is very convenient. <br>  On the question creation page you are offered to fill in several fields: <br>  ‚Ä¢ The question title itself (maximum 120 characters); <br>  ‚Ä¢ Addition to the question (4000 more characters, visible when opening the question page); <br>  ‚Ä¢ Category and subcategory of the question (all questions on the project are divided into categories); <br>  ‚Ä¢ Tags (they are tags); <br>  ‚Ä¢ Add a poll (more on this below); <br>  ‚Ä¢ Tick 'Receive replies to e-mail' (mailbox clogging); <br>  ‚Ä¢ Tick 'Allow comments to answers'; <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7e8/26b/fc3/7e826bfc3522d16cdae96d038a423100.png" alt="image"><br><br>  After clicking on the 'ask' button or by pressing Ctrl + Enter, your question falls into the general list of questions on the main page.  You get 5 points, as it was written above.  A link to this question also appears in your personal account. <br>  There are limits on the number of questions created per day, as well as on other actions on the 'Answers', depending on the user's points. <br>  Almost on every page, on the left, there is a list of categories of questions, most of which have subcategories.  Such cataloging helps to narrow the topic of questions and allows you to answer questions on your favorite topic or topic, the answers to questions in which you probably know. <br>  If no one answered the question within three days - the question is considered deleted and 5 points are returned to the author of such a question. <br>  In the event that more than one answer is received to a question, then the author in time gets the opportunity to put the question to a vote or close by selecting the best answer. <br>  If the question was placed on the vote, then users can click on the button opposite each answer to this question and select the best answer, thereby earning exactly one point.  Then, the question closes, and the best answer is the one that got the most votes. <br>  If the author of the question after three hours chooses the best answer himself, then he is awarded 3 points and the question is considered closed.  On the closed question page, the best answer is placed above the rest of the answers and stands out in a pleasant shade, and the author of the best answer gets 10 points. <br>  It turns out that questions are divided into open, on voting and closed.  All of them have been reviewed by me. <br>  The best are questions.  They fall into the Golden Fund. <br>  On the question page, immediately in question there is a button scale for assessing the interestingness of the question - from one to five. <br>  For each answer there is also such a scale.  Rated the interest of the question or answer does not get points - this is all for the statistics of each user. <br><br><h4>  Polls </h4><br><br>  One of the recent innovations of the project.  You can create polls to explore the opinions and views of other people.  You can create a poll on the question creation page.  You can add response options, and also choose whether the respondent will be able to select multiple answers.  For participation in the survey all accrued only one point.  And for the creation of the survey is deducted 5 points, as well as for the question. <br><br><img src="http://img3.imageshack.us/img3/7867/opros.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The lane of the lead option, as seen in the screenshot, is orange.  Visually, the answers are presented only in the form of stripes, but not in the form of a convenient chart. <br>  After three hours it is possible to close the survey.  And you can wait, and after a while, click on the 'extend' button and the survey will remain open for about a week.  If you do not do this, the poll will close automatically after some time.  You can distinguish a poll from a question on the main page using the word 'poll' before the question. <br><br><h4>  Tags </h4><br><br>  Each question or survey is accompanied by tags (tags) that the author of the question or survey can add. <br>  By tags it is possible to look for the necessary subject of a question a little better and easier. <br>  There is the following trick on the project: if, when creating a poll in tags, you specify, among other tags, the word 'survey', then the number of participants in the survey will increase by about 10-15 times!  The essence of this phenomenon is that most people simply get tired of answering questions (typing on the keyboard) and they just want to poke the mouse (without using the keyboard).  That's when they just go through the polls and take part in them.  Plus it's also interesting.  And how to search for polls?  By tags, the cloud of which is located not only on the main page, but also in each category of questions. <br>  Here is a tag cloud of the entire project: <br><br><img src="http://img16.imageshack.us/img16/7677/oblako.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Also, if you extend your survey about once a week, then in a month you can reach about 1500 participants in your survey!  Impressive?  But this can be achieved with sufficient interest of the question in the survey, or, oddly enough, with its simplicity, for example: "What fruit do you like?", "What is your profession?". <br>  For comparison: if you do not specify the word 'survey' in the tags, then you can only dial up to 100 people during the first hours of the survey (they are also the most productive for the survey). <br><br><h4>  Personal Area </h4><br><br>  Each user has their own page, called Personal Area. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/724/9fb/63c/7249fb63cd22ddaa49596f6f55460093.png" alt="image"><br><br>  In addition to the user's questions and answers, various statistics are present there: <br>  ‚Ä¢ Number of questions and answers; <br>  ‚Ä¢ General assessment of the interesting questions and answers; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Recent user actions and points accrued for these actions. <br>  ‚Ä¢ The number of remaining actions on the current day before the limit; <br>  ‚Ä¢ User question and answer labels; <br>  ‚Ä¢ The number of the best answers and the level of efficiency; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Settings (avatar, e-mail notification); <br><br><h4>  Generalization </h4><br><br>  The resource is also multi-content: it allows you to insert links, pictures (from the Internet or from photo hosting mail.ru, including gif animation), video (also from the Internet or video hosting mail.ru) to questions, answers and comments to answers.  The use of tags is not complete, only changing fonts is available (bold, italic, underlined, strikethrough). <br>  If you need to get a lot of answers to your question (about 5 times more), then you can send an SMS costing about one US dollar and the question will appear in the 'questions-leaders'.  This block is located on the main page or on the category pages.  In addition, the level of responders is increased by the fact that the respondent to this question gets twice as many points. <br>  As in Mail@mail.ru, there is a spell checker. <br>  For flood and violating the rules of the project users next to each question and answer there is a button "complain".  By clicking on it, a window pops up where you can complain to the user.  This complaint comes to the moderators of the project (there are enough of them in each category) and, in case of violation, the question or answer is deleted. <br>  There is a mobile version of the project at wap.otvet.mail.ru.  A page in this version weighs about 4 Kb, and Opera Mini brings it to a weight of 1 Kb.  In the mobile version there is no possibility to create polls and use videos and pictures. <br>  The client for the service has not yet been invented, even a widget for Opera or a plug-in for FireFox.  I now think about it - maybe that will work out. <br>  All design and management are made in the style of mail.ru: pleasant and understandable, so there are no problems in management at all. <br>  Your first question will appear in the 'Welcome' category, especially for beginners.  In order to 'attract and not let go' the user when they first met, the number of answers to the first question in this category is stimulated by double the points for answering such a question. <br>  As well as on Habr√©, there is a list of participants and questions. <br>  The more you have efficiency and the more answers, the more you have the level of limits and the more points for the answer. <br>  The site header contains statistics on the number of online users, as well as the number of answers and questions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5fe/367/b96/5fe367b9671c9c2176179ea08775d9a6.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Due to the abundance of time zones in Russia and the CIS, the minimum number of online users on the project is approximately 4,500 people (this is approximately in the morning hours MSK), and the maximum number is in the afternoon and evening according to MSK: approximately 13,500 people.  Service is becoming increasingly popular - more recently, in the summer and spring, the maximum was the figure of 9-10 thousand users simultaneously online.  So, such large numbers (13,500) make it more likely that an answer to your question is found. <br>  Naturally, there is a search, incl.  advanced, for questions and answers.  It is worth noting the presence of search by tags. <br>  Perhaps you yourself noticed that Google often gives a link to the Answers page in the first 5-7 positions. <br>  If you believe the resource netchart.ru, then the user spends on the project an average of 9 minutes, while viewing about 8 pages.  On the same site Answers@mail.ru occupy the 30th place in the overall rating. <br>  The service Answers@mail.ru is equipped with a clear and at the same time concise system of assistance. <br><br>  In my opinion, in order to feel the "atmosphere" of the resource, it is not enough, of course, just to read an article about it - you need to try it yourself! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/70086/">https://habr.com/ru/post/70086/</a></p>
