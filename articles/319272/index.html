Recently, we had a team meeting, she helped me to finally make sure that there is a serious problem in understanding what is <s>cool</s> good. <br><br>  Who am i?  I started as an admin, continued as a developer, and in the end I came to an entrepreneur, I know a lot of things, but not very deep.  This is what I can <s>sell</s> to give as my professional circle, but I try not to do it, although no, I'm lying, but I wrote about it, how could it be otherwise, my Ego will just wither away, not to say publicly: ‚ÄúI'm a cool special!‚Äù and to himself he adds: "and you are not ...". <br><br>  Why this psychoanalysis?  I want to share my observations with the same steep or even steeper, because I think that such ‚Äúcoolness‚Äù is the limit and limitation that needs to be overcome.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br>  We all got used to being evaluated and since childhood have been taught the formula: ‚ÄúI am good and you are not‚Äù.  At school, they give us good and excellent, but what about, we learned a lesson, crammed a rhyme, tried ... and deservedly received an award, we were ‚Äústroked on the head‚Äù and were given a <s>medal</s> grade, but Zhabenko and Myshkin received <br>  Two, since they are not like me, they suck, but I'm cool ... Any measurement is relative, and personal evaluation, too, we get used to the fact that we need these losers, otherwise how to feel super? <br><br>  Further, more, we become a student of a prestigious university, we find ourselves in an environment where there are more steep ones, since Zabenko and Myshkin are partially eliminated, we continue to fill our heads with knowledge, eagerly and persistently, to be the best, get a diploma, preferably red and become a young and promising specialist .  Yes, it happens that we do not go to the university or throw it (what is there to do with such a luminaries like me?), And we gnaw down the granite of practical sciences on our own, pumping ourselves and our Ego to come to the interview and say, ‚ÄúI am cool and cost much ! ‚Äù <br><br>  Of course, they hire us, why, we're super.  There we meet a seasoned specialist, who explains on his fingers that we are never cool, because we are inexperienced and we have not smelled life.  Usually, this is directly the boss or senior colleague, here is the joy for him, now, then he is definitely cool, and we suck.  We undertake everything, we take the initiative, we plow as it should be for three, we have to prove to him and everyone that we are cool too and deserve a ‚Äúmedal‚Äù. <br><br>  But out of the corner of the eye we notice that we have competitors - colleagues, not many, but we have, and if not the immediate superior, then the leadership is precisely those wise (dur-) aki.  We grow by leaps and bounds, we read, listen to lectures, in short, more and more.  And here we are appointed as a manager, manager, senior developer, i.e.  those who stand above the others.  Although yes, it happens that the <s>carrot</s> medal is carried by us, but the essence does not change, we are simply looking for a more ‚Äújust‚Äù bosses in the face of another company, where we continue our successful career growth. <br><br>  In the new role of tearing and swords, we see how almost everything is done through the well ... and we put on a titanic effort to fix it, we feel like a superhero who got into the swamp, into the swamp of mediocrity.  We make demands on colleagues almost the same as on ourselves, i.e.  high, ambitious, but we get a grumpy-silent feedback, which in a nutshell can be sounded like: "calm down, work the same ...".  As a result, the full tryndets in symbiosis with chronic time trouble.  Here, by will, not by will, we begin to assume that there are two types of people: amorphous-violet-plankton (colleagues) and active-red-leader (we and a couple more adequate colleagues), but something whispers deep inside that everything is not so banal as it seems. <br><br>  At this point, you need to make a choice - how to relate to all this?  Take the theory with a taste of the Third Reich or?  About the second option at the end, but the first is very often taken, so that everything fits into the installation: "I'm cool, and you're not!" <br><br>  As a result, a simplified picture of the world is often used - there are successful people who are better / cooler / more professional than others, and there is a gray mass of losers / performers / losers.  The first vigorously rule, and the second rowing oars, and, as lazily as possible.  This alignment is not very conducive to effective work, as they try to really work one-two-three, and the rest, at best, fulfill the job description in order to get a salary.  Common situation?  I am sure that practically everyone who considers himself a pro has come across such a phenomenon.  And most of us take it as a norm, it leads to obvious intolerance, someone will say - to the class struggle! <br><br>  And no!  In fact, this is not a struggle, it is a common symbiosis of two types, and mutually beneficial.  The first people feel that they are very necessary and important professionals, who rule not very clever and active colleagues, and if everything went wrong, it was always a dream, you can always find those guilty in the disorderly ranks of the performers.  The second goes - the victim?  Not at all, they are well settled, as they have income, but there is practically no responsibility for the results, and most importantly, all their ‚Äúfailures‚Äù are very easily attributed to the ‚Äúcretinism‚Äù of the first.  Of course, sometimes they are fired, but they find another place where everything is repeated the same.  This system is so obkatalis that most perceive it as a normal and the only possible form of joint activity of people. <br><br>  But progress does not stand still, including in the organization of joint activities.  Already, a new approach is being actively developed, where the wording ‚ÄúI am cool and you are not‚Äù changes to ‚Äúwe are cool and they are not‚Äù, and further to transformation into ‚Äúwe are happy and self-sufficient‚Äù.  This current has several names and various branches, but the essence is the same - a person constantly develops with others on the basis of interdependence and cooperation, revealing the enormous synergistic potential of the team to be happy and help others in the same cause. <br><br>  Many are skeptical of such views, and it is clear why we are accustomed to compete and fight for a piece of cake, suppress or submit to suppression, to be "cool specialists" or "irresponsible mediocrity."  And these are not just beliefs, this is psychology - i.e.  the level of our development.  To overcome this barrier you need to develop not only professionally, but also as an individual. <br><br>  New forms of organization <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/323532/">already exist</a> , while not very noticeable, but their efficiency is amazing.  When developed people have a common mission, shared responsibility and power with a system of self-organization, they are capable of great accomplishments. <br><br>  I am convinced that the future is precisely in such forms of joint activity, since it has gone from a dependent mediocrity to a self-sufficient professional, and I move on to an interdependent person who, <a href="https://pokupo.ru/promolanding">together with others,</a> is able to change this world for the better. <br><br>  Not modest?  Yes, if we consider the author of the paragraph above my Ego, but it is not there. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/319272/">https://habr.com/ru/post/319272/</a></p>
