  <section class="page js-page"><h1>MediaInsight - monitoring traditional media</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><h3>  Good ping, Internet having </h3><br><br>  I want to ask you - do you have a TV?  And without waiting for an answer, I will assume that there is :) I myself do not have it, but it does not matter.  It is important to have an idea about this kind of media.  Why is this necessary?  And then what I want to tell you about one very interesting project.  I learned here that there are children who are engaged in monitoring the media - television, radio, newspapers.  That is, just like Yandex tracks activity on blogs, they monitor the broadcast. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Voice recognition </h3><br>  Yes Yes.  To track the mention of anything on television and radio, you must have a powerful voice recognition engine.  Unfortunately, I have no information on how it works.  But judging by the quality of the recognized text - this is an automated solution, and not Indians, as in a fairly well-known service remind;).  I would really like to know how this engine works inside.  Or maybe even get at his disposal a more or less relevant copy of it. <br><br><h3>  Channel monitoring </h3><br>  To keep track of all that is said on numerous channels, you need to have a bunch of tuners, each tuned to its own wave.  Or maybe there are some other ways?  But I know nothing about them.  This part of the project interests me no less than the voice recognition engine.

    <h3>  And how do I know all this? </h3><br>  Not.  I have nothing to do with them.  Just drank a beer with one good person.  Heard a couple of entertaining stories.  I looked at it all with my own eyes. <br><br><h3>  Talk less, work more! </h3><br>  The guys posted on <a href="http://mediainsight.info/ru/main/">their website a</a> few demonstration examples of the use of their technology.  The <a href="http://mediainsight.info/ru/search/%3Fdemo%3D1">search in the archive</a> seems to me especially interesting: you can see what they are saying <a href="http://mediainsight.info/ru/search/%3Fsearch%3D%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B8%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D1%258B%26startsearch%3D%25D0%259F%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%26fromdate_on%3Don%26fromdate%3D10-05-2009%26fromdate_unixtime%3D1241918297%26todate%3D09-06-2009%26todate_unixtime%3D1244510297%26timezone%3D-4">about pirates</a> , or find out how the <a href="http://mediainsight.info/ru/search/%3Fsearch%3D%25D0%25BA%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%26startsearch%3D%25D0%259F%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%26fromdate_on%3Don%26fromdate%3D10-05-2009%26fromdate_unixtime%3D1241932697%26todate%3D09-06-2009%26todate_unixtime%3D1244510672%26timezone%3D-4">problem of crisis is</a> brought to the media.  It is also interesting to hear about such a phenomenon as <a href="http://mediainsight.info/ru/search/%3Fsearch%3D%25D0%25BC%25D1%2583%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582%26startsearch%3D%25D0%259F%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%26fromdate_on%3Don%26fromdate%3D10-05-2009%26fromdate_unixtime%3D1241947097%26todate%3D09-06-2009%26todate_unixtime%3D1244510751%26timezone%3D-4">mutants</a> - on this word the robot usually makes mistakes :) <br><br><h3>  Monitors and others like him </h3><br>  I think it is clear - there are many ways to monetize such a project.  Not to mention that monitoring itself is quite an interesting thing, because it is still possible to process any conversations with the help of a similar engine.  That only is the distillation of the recording of negotiations in a textual form.  And if you think about listening devices on phones - mmmm :).  A similar project in my opinion looks very attractive for large and medium-sized businesses, as well as for developers of enterprise management systems. <br><br><h3>  My hopes </h3><br>  I do not know how justified my hopes are, but I really want to see something like ‚ÄúYandex.blog‚Äù and ‚Äúblogosphere pulse‚Äù - a page with charts where I could find out what is most spoken in traditional media and how it changes with time .  I think it would be worthy of an advertisement for mediainsight.  But who knows where the development of this whole business will go?  :) <br><br>  <a href="http://nekt.ru/2009/06/mediainsight-monitoring-tradicionnyx-smi/">shortly</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/61665/">https://habr.com/ru/post/61665/</a></p>
