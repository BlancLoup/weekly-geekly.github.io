This is what a good manager does differently in order to grow professionally and take care of his team. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  A bad manager begins a personal meeting with an employee with questions: </h4><br><blockquote>  How is the project going? <br>  Why is it not finished yet? </blockquote><br><h4>  A good manager starts with questions: </h4><br><blockquote>  How do you feel and how are you doing? <br>  Is there anything I can help you with? </blockquote><br><br>  A bad manager will ask a dozen more questions, interrupting five times on a mobile phone conversation and ending the conversation when his questions have been answered.

      A good manager allows the rest of the conversation to follow a natural way, based on the first two questions and is open to answers to many questions of the employee. <br><br>  A bad manager prepares for a meeting 5 minutes before it starts. <br><br>  A good manager asks the above two questions before the meeting (via email or in any other way), so employees have time to reflect on the answers and are really able to come up with solutions for any problems. <br><br><h4>  There are several other things that good managers do and bad managers do not: </h4><br><ul><li>  Set the tone for the meeting, aimed at people, not at projects. </li><li>  They never hold meetings in the office and try to choose a neutral place like a cafe or a park for a conversation. </li><li>  They are responsive - they try to touch the family, some personal goals and objectives, etc., in the conversation.  - they allow you to become more personal in your team, so they allow their employees to get to know themselves closer as a person, not a boss. </li><li>  Employees are taught more often, rather than dictate what to do or punish. </li><li>  They know that they are the root cause of any layoffs, and people leave the team most often because of problems with management than for some other reason, including because of insufficient wages and pressure. </li><li>  They thank the employees during personal meetings for the work done since their last meeting, and it does not matter if it is something insignificant, it will be remembered and will be appreciated.  And this is absolutely not the main reason for this behavior. </li><li>  They know that they work primarily with people, and only then with software, in retail, hotel service, insurance or in a design studio.  Excellent leadership skills are required in any company. </li><li>  See themselves as team leaders, not managers of individuals.  They know that their profession helps to give employees the best results and inspire employees to their daily maximum dedication, even if the outcome is gloomy at first. </li><li>  They focus on advancing the career of each employee in their team and know that good things happen only as a result of such behavior. </li><li>  Bad managers don't do any of the above.  They focus on their own careers and often lock themselves on domestic politics.  They use information as a lever and run from the ship at the first sign of trouble. </li></ul><br><h4>  Hire good managers.
