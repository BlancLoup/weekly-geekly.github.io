  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Highscreen WinJoy Review</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The Windows Phone platform entered the market a bit later than eminent competitors.  It is not surprising that at first the devices lacked functions that had long become familiar to smartphone users.  Nevertheless, the pace taken by Microsoft allowed not only to level these differences, attracting the attention of third-party developers to the platform, but also to provide the public with a truly coherent and harmonious system, on which many modern devices enjoy working.  One of them is an entry-level device from Highscreen with the sonorous name WinJoy.  By the way, WinJoy can be won in the <a href="http://special.habrahabr.ru/microsoft/81/">application contest</a> .  Do not forget to take part in the competition after you get acquainted with the review! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/641/42a/955/64142a9552f648adbfb1b8ac92d975e6.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  For the first time taking a smartphone in hand, first of all you pay attention to its modest dimensions: 122 x 63 x 9.9 mm.  The device weighs only 105 grams.  At the time of widespread rampant "shovels" and large diagonals, a device with a display of four inches seems to be the benchmark of compactness.  Indeed - WinJoy will easily fit in any pocket, and practical case materials and good ergonomics of control elements will allow you to use your smartphone without fear of dropping it from your hands. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/908/810/577/908810577a2940f2a6c2f99693c241d9.jpg">

      In addition to the standard for Windows Phone OS touch buttons on the front panel, we have a classic volume rocker and a power button, which, incidentally, is like on ‚Äúbig‚Äù smartphones - on the right side, not on top.  However, it is not difficult to find it with both the right and the left hand, so it‚Äôs impossible to attribute the decision to the category of ergonomic errors.  There is no dedicated camera button, but in the settings you can set the shutter release by touch to any place on the screen. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/41f/abd/1ae/41fabd1aec9746b7a57c9ce6d22fdeea.jpg"><br><br>  The device is assembled well - the body does not creak and does not play even when squeezed, and this is in the presence of interchangeable panels!  Moreover, an attentive reader will surely notice the front camera's eye and a set of standard sensors on the front panel, but quite recently these elements remained the prerogative of higher class devices. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6c3/0bb/564/6c30bb56402f46aea243776191ea943c.jpg"><br><br>  In the world of smartphones, as in the automotive industry, various ‚Äúbells and whistles‚Äù regularly migrate from one segment to another, gradually moving from the category of optional equipment to the mandatory standard.  So here - in the presence of a full set of sensors (accelerometer, proximity and illumination sensors) and wireless interfaces, including Wi-Fi 802.11b / g / n, Bluetooth 4.0 and GPS / GLONASS.  There is no NFC and any exotic type of IR port, which has recently received a second birth. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ff2/a02/deb/ff2a02debc64410cbcefe6c966e06d4d.jpg"><br><br>  Most of the front panel is expected to occupy a capacitive touch screen with the following characteristics: <br><ul><li>  Diagonal: 4 '' </li><li>  Resolution: 800x480px, WVGA </li><li>  Pixel density: 233 PPI </li><li>  Matrix Type: TFT-TN </li><li>  Support simultaneous keystrokes: up to two </li></ul><br>  If you turn the smartphone over, we will be greeted by the lens of the main five-megapixel camera with flash and an inconspicuous company logo against the bright red battery cover.  A black color solution is also available, and in the near future, blue and white devices should appear on store shelves.  The side with which the user will have to interact most often, in any case, will remain black.  It may seem that a protective film is stuck on the screen, but this is not so, so do not try to tear it off - it will not work. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1cd/a13/352/1cda1335248e401b84ab60d4ff0676a6.jpg"><br><br>  The delivery package is standard - a bit of waste paper, a charger with a USB-microUSB version 2.0 cable and a simple stereo headset - all in a neat cardboard box. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/424/e2b/293/424e2b293e2b4e838cdd714c3877da5f.jpg"><br><br>  Gently prying off the back cover of a semi-gloss plastic, we will see a 1700 mAh battery, two slots for microSIM SIM cards and a compartment for placing a microSD memory card. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/000/bbe/971/000bbe971a9f4d79bfd67db9a92ba8be.jpg"><br><br>  It should be noted the convenience of the chosen form factors - most modern devices use microSIM, and, if necessary, rearranging the card in Highscreen ‚Äúto call‚Äù is not difficult.  Let the replacement of the SIM card be a matter of minutes, and the procedure itself will be carried out free of charge in the cabin of any operator, such attention to detail from the manufacturer cannot but please. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c54/c81/03d/c54c8103d1a645b3b04e2dbabdd10d82.jpg"><br><br>  In a number of reports on the performance of the device, support for memory cards with a capacity of up to 32 GB inclusive is noted.  However, the installed 64 GB microSDXC media was correctly recognized by the system, so you can not worry about the data storage space. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c08/25c/5d6/c0825c5d6b3f4d2b8147e1d11eb1a4db.jpg"><br><br>  Before turning on WinJoy, let's go over the remaining characteristics: <br><ul><li>  Processor: four cores, 1200 MHz, Qualcomm MSM8212 </li><li>  RAM: 512 MB </li><li>  Memory for data storage: 4 GB, available to the user about a gigabyte </li></ul><br>  The logo of the manufacturer gives way to a symbol familiar to anyone who has ever dealt with Windows-systems, and the device is ready to work.  Despite the non-flaming iron, WinJoy hasn't noticed any delays - applications switch quickly, scrolling is smooth, animations are pleasing to the eye. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/df7/b07/d10/df7b07d10caf4a0cb8e57888d7fc92ab.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/17e/c3a/485/17ec3a485bb24764a396ee4658df5c0a.png"><br><br>  By and large, the software of the device is identical to any other device that received an update to Windows Phone 8.1, but it still has its own specifics in working with two SIM-cards. <br><br>  Each active SIM card received its own applications for dialing numbers and working with SMS, and in the contacts appeared switches, the display on which clearly makes it clear which card will be dialed when you click on it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/698/87d/56a/69887d56a59541b3ae1f0981c27f4b03.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/611/7ae/6fa/6117ae6fab6a43ecbe55c153dd824866.png"><br><br>  3G support is implemented for both slots, but they can only work in turn on third-generation networks.  Thus, when filling a device with SIM cards, it is worth considering in advance which of them will use the mobile Internet, and enable data transfer in the settings exclusively for it. <br><br>  There are no complaints about the quality of communication, but the speaker volume could have been higher.  Some special failures as a signal reception were also not noticed, but you always want your phone to ‚Äúcatch‚Äù the network even better, right? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/898/63b/21c/89863b21cb8f407db046087864afc836.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/133/38d/09a/13338d09a2d943f0b68ac624a0a76576.png"><br><br>  After the initial configuration, which includes setting the time zone in accordance with the manufacturer‚Äôs recommendations, as well as adding a Microsoft account, you can easily add other services, including corporate ones.  It supports the loading of security certificates, work with Exchange services and other functions that have long been familiar to the corporate segment. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fd9/9fd/e17/fd99fde172334ef3ad41001a81f625af.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f8f/439/504/f8f43950483a481ea48c4462d81dd906.png"><br><br>  By and large, from the additional applications you need to put a minimum - third-party clients of social networks, news readers and other utilities for working with content.  All the rest is out of the box and there is no desire to select alternatives.  Judge for yourself: control of cellular traffic with a flexible system of limits and warnings is available.  Options for optimizing power consumption and managing wireless interfaces are present.  Special mode ‚ÄúIn the car‚Äù, which allows you to turn off all notifications - also there! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6ef/9cc/81e/6ef9cc81e6704cbbb9854acccee849f0.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7e7/73a/c28/7e773ac2859a4e1083ff2f5a955f6d48.png"><br><br>  It is important that after its activation you can completely ignore distractions, including incoming calls and text messages.  Of course, there is a risk that you miss something important, but concentrating on the road situation is worth it.  Conveniently, the mode with the specified alert settings can be turned on automatically, if you only connect to a Bluetooth device in the car.  It also supports the transfer of the address book to display contacts when making calls (of course, if this functionality is supported on the side of the headset). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/922/8f6/f8a/9228f6f8ab804f92bc38315c89444cfe.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/217/57e/252/21757e25212c421f99e9c8c6b1d6515e.png"><br><br>  In your free time you can have fun with almost any modern games available in the Windows Phone Store.  Yes, yes, Asphalt 8 and other hits are launched and work on the device without problems, not to mention ‚Äútoys‚Äù easier.  Of course, no one has canceled certain restrictions for devices with 512 MB of RAM, but for developers this device can be an excellent testing ground.  If your application works well on WinJoy, then it is likely that everything will be fine with it on other devices under Windows. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6f2/cf9/040/6f2cf90407b2454490c0945446b7e0b8.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/819/c49/0fb/819c490fb3014f579c10281f0dd11260.png"><br><br>  Moreover, the affordable price of a smartphone makes it a great replacement for any emulator.  And the support of the popular form factor of SIM-cards allows you to easily use WinJoy as a second device in addition to another smartphone, with a larger screen.  In standby mode, the device from Highscreen practically does not sit down, but at the right moment it can help out. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a63/e09/7b1/a63e097b162b4d4b90349e55b6bd74a4.jpg"><br><br>  By the way, the camera is relatively good.  On the screen, due to the not very large viewing angles and some fading, the pictures may seem unimportant, but on the computer everything is fine both with color rendering and sharpness.  Again, WinJoy does not pretend to be a laurels photoflagman, but it‚Äôs easy to record the right moments and chat in a video chat with it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/85a/c47/64c/85ac4764ce3a4ef3af155a81c3fa1b24.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c44/587/ed1/c44587ed1bf148b18aa2e748924ac76b.png"><br><br>  Examples of photos taken in fully automatic mode can be found below. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e32/c07/86d/e32c0786df344b7b99705bc509f6a947.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9ad/032/016/9ad0320167d547dea0d15966cea0b51c.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/336/616/996/336616996e464b64be137e8094158e03.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b44/63d/c4d/b4463dc4d8bc46158bc1256c884fb980.jpg"><br><br>  As for the standard operation, including streaming listening to music, making calls, updating social network tapes and digging in the settings, you can safely count on a standard day from morning to evening.  Records device does not set, but look for exercises instead of lunch, too, do not have to. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/01e/2b1/d01/01e2b1d01d864e95b3dbfc0a79bfa510.jpg"><br><br>  Following the brief acquaintance, it is safe to say the following: one of the first pancakes on the Windows Phone platform did not come out lumpy for a domestic manufacturer.  Before us is a strong budget device with balanced characteristics and an attractive price.  For some, it can be an entrance ticket to the world of Windows Phone, for someone - a test device, and for everyone else - a comfortable means of communication with maximum personalization. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/363745/">https://habr.com/ru/post/363745/</a></p>
