From friends you know about who eats for breakfast, lunch and dinner, who has what hairstyle and who spends Friday evening. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  And try to learn from friends about what your friends are working on.  Perhaps at this very moment, while you painfully reflect on the motifs of Russian folklore in the works of Remizov, your associate in St. Petersburg is writing an essay on this topic.  But he is unlikely to describe in detail his work on Facebook or VKontakte. <br>  But with much more willing to share their experiences with like-minded people in a highly specialized social network.  Just such a social network conceived by the authors of <a href="http://projife.com/">ProJife</a> .  <a href="http://wanted.vc/blog/%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D1%2584%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25B9-%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581/">+++</a> <habracut>

All for a reason: studying the project, we try to present its place in the food chain, and the place of coupon sites in the food chain has been <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/internet/121971/">in doubt for</a> some time <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/internet/121971/">.</a> <br>  However, today we are writing about the coupon service <a href="http://www.dailysmiles.ru/">DailySmiles</a> .  There are two reasons: firstly, it covers a large share of the regional market, and secondly, it works equally with all types of coupons, both paid and free.  <a href="http://wanted.vc/blog/%25D0%25BA%25D1%2583%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD-%25D0%25B5%25D1%2589%25D1%2591-%25D0%25BA%25D1%2583%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD/">+++</a> <a href="http://wanted.vc/blog/%25D0%25BA%25D1%2583%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD-%25D0%25B5%25D1%2589%25D1%2591-%25D0%25BA%25D1%2583%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD/"><br><br><br><br></a> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ab6/cc2/03a/ab6cc203a719fe750a0c8a08d3078423.png" align="left">  Last week, we wrote about <a href="http://domosite.ru/">DomoSite</a> , a service for conscious neighbors who, through joint efforts, are trying to make the world a better place for their own home. <br>  Service <a href="http://vestochkin.ru/">"Newsochkin"</a> focuses on the same good purpose, but in a slightly different perspective: the main focus of the project is on an sms-alert residents of the house about all sorts of things related to utilities, shutdowns, accidents, etc.  <a href="http://wanted.vc/blog/%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D1%258B%25D0%25B5-%25D1%2581%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8/">+++</a> <a href="http://wanted.vc/blog/%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D1%258B%25D0%25B5-%25D1%2581%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8/"><br><br><br><br></a> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f99/651/8df/f996518dfac56eba57ff1834270b3d32.png" align="left">  The author of the project <a href="http://jetcus.com/">Jetsus</a> Vadim Tarasov has already appeared on Wanted.VC.

In fairness, and in addition to the first part of the title.  The rest of the <a href="http://jetcus.com/">Jetcus</a> - completely independent education.

The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe project, the logical way that follows from the above, is to offer the buyer to get a loan at the very moment when he thinks about, say, buying an ultra-fast juicer, looking thoughtfully at the monitor. <br>  Break away from the monitor will not have to.  <a href="http://wanted.vc/blog/%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B7-%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D1%2588%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D1%2585-%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B6%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9/">+++</a> <br><br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/93f/e0a/c17/93fe0ac177116db37920dcd6d6221032.png" align="left">  The <a href="http://cybergame.tv/">CyberGame.T</a> <a href="http://cybergame.tv/">V service</a> , according to its authors, is the first Russian project of this kind. <br>  This is a broadcast network for broadcasting computer games, a kind of sports channel for gamers.

Nevertheless, the <a href="http://www.a5.ru/">A5</a> project - a platform that combines a flash system for creating websites and hosting - according to the authors of its authors, "is completely unique for Russia and the CIS countries."  <a href="http://wanted.vc/blog/%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D1%2583%25D0%25BA%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B5-%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D1%2588%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5/">+++</a> <br><br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1f4/2c4/4ca/1f42c44cafafc2ff6190efc02ff1917c.png" align="left">  The project with the long <a href="http://stroicompas.ru/">National Construction Portal Stroykompas was</a> created by the same team of authors as the A5. <br>  In addition to the authors, both services have another common feature - the scale.  What is going to become (or at least partially already become) <a href="http://stroicompas.ru/">Stroykompas</a> is quite clear from the name. <br>  In fairness, the portal already has everything necessary to achieve its goals of quality.  <a href="http://wanted.vc/blog/%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B9%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D1%2589%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0/">+++</a> <br><br><br></habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/129175/">https://habr.com/ru/post/129175/</a></p>
