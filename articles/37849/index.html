      And there are no good system administrators in the world.  Just as there are no good accountants and laptops. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>About sysadmins</b> <br><br>  But the fact is that you will not become a sysadmin, or an accountant who will be erected a monument, or ‚Äúthey will remember me‚Äù, ‚Äúthey will start talking about me‚Äù, or someone will say anything about you, we always have the Internet here in the office, and phones work, and printers print, and more than 15 minutes unplanned downtime are extremely rare.  You think this is all the merit of a sysadmin who tuned failover to switch Internet channels, put competent uninterruptible power supplies, implemented well-updated anti-virus programs (minimizing traffic, of course), developed a backup policy with a scanty budget, took away the right to install any programs from users ?  No, of course, this was the way it should be, this is so in itself, and it is strange that it could be somehow different.  But it could be.  But that would have been a different story in another company.  The sysadmin is a service tool.  This is a shovel.  If you have a hua vaya shovel, a curve and with dents, you will dig slowly, almost gnaw the ground with your teeth, or you will dig quickly and efficiently if you have a good, polished shovel.  But the fact is that you will dig with any shovel.  In this case, digging is a business, the purpose of which, of course, is to make money.  A shovel is nothing more than an IT department. <br><br>  All the troubles (if any) of the sysadmin from the fact that the IT department is a costly department in any enterprise.  We (IT) do not make money, we select them and spend.  Do you like to give more or receive money?  Therefore, with a pain in his heart, the director (owner) will sign the account on some kind of server, the purpose of which he doesn‚Äôt understand.  It should be understood that improving business performance is also minimizing costs.  If the IT manager can convey the idea that ‚Äúthis new server is over 5 kiloway‚Äù will minimize the time costs of servicing, say, the sales department, because reports will now be faster, the manager will spend 30 minutes less time per day to receive the report, and the salary manager per month divided by the number of days in the month multiplied by the percentage, which is 30 minutes a day from 8 hours of the working day, well, etc.  etc.  and lead the calculation to clear for the head of the figures, it will be very, stsuko, a good IT manager, he minimizes not only IT costs for the enterprise and increases the effectiveness of the shovel, but also keeps the sysadmin‚Äôs nerves soft and silky. <br><br>  The sysadmin salary has a visible limit.  A sysadmin is a costly employee.  But the sales manager is not a costly employee, he just ‚Äúearns‚Äù this very money.  If it is good to stimulate a sales manager, then he will ‚Äúearn‚Äù more money for the company.  If it is good to stimulate financially the sisamina, then nothing will change, but if this is not done, then a good sysadmin will leave.  That is why a hell of a good sysadmin will NEVER have a salary higher in a company than a good sales manager.  The salary will be exactly what you need to pay, so that the sysadmin would not leave. <br><br>  And this all happens on the background of the fact that a typical sysadmin is a very educated, developed and intelligent person, but there is no material happiness in his life, because it can only occur as a result: he chooses a company when he buys a server, he hopes ordering components for an upgrade, drop anything back home, for example, a hard drive. <br><br>  Being a sysadmin - think of yourself as the god of computers in the human world.  And this is quite small for people, but a lot for computers.  And in our era of computers, people practically move to the world of computers.  A wise sysadmin is a person who has managed to move back from the world of computers to the world of people.  And then he ceases to be a sysadmin, and sits down to weave sandals.  Or paska from shit, but do it already for people. <br><br>  Do I need to be a sysadmin?  I think, nevertheless, it is necessary in order to understand what kind of happiness it is, NOT TO BE A SYSMAD. <br><br>  Crosspost from my blog <a href="http://nexus.org.ua/weblog/message/623/">nexus.org.ua/weblog/message/623</a> , somehow remembered. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/37849/">https://habr.com/ru/post/37849/</a></p>
