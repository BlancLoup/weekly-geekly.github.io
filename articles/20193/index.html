  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Talk about file sharing</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Recently, my friend asked me in ICQ: <br>  - Tell me, please, what is the economic feasibility of, say, the same rapid speeds? <br>  I understand that traffic from the bourgeoisie is cheap, but in the same place there are huge amounts of traffic.  Is it really kicks off paid accounts? <br><br>  And I gave a small impromptu explanation in the same place, in ICQ.  I also want to share with those who are interested in this topic. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So - the main thesis and explanation: <br><br>  File hosting is simply ‚Äúhosting the other way around‚Äù where it is not the one who wants to share content who pays for traffic, but the one who wants to receive this content.  Open the topic. <br>  If a person wants to put a file on the floor for 1000 people, then he is forced to buy 500GB traffic for anyone who is potentially interested in the file.

      Where did this situation come from?  Look at the root.  This is a direct copy of the style of doing business offline.  And the file is advertising material.  There were papers on the streets and booklets ‚Äî files and presentations.  In any case, the advertisement and the costs of its distribution are paid by the submitter of these materials. <br><br>  In the case of file sharing the situation is fundamentally different.  Rapidshara grew out of another model, it grew out of Varese.  Those.  users are interested in files that are already ‚Äústolen goods‚Äù in this case, or goods at the price of delivery.  Accordingly, the user is willing to pay for the delivery of free goods, because  the cost is incommensurable <br><br>  A bit of history.  Varezny traffic.  There are releasers.  How did they live before the rapid speeds?  They hacked FTP and distributed files to a limited number of people.  Hacking provided free traffic and anonymity. <br>  Then the young boy offered his service to the stage.  I will host, and you - not soared.  Because  in America there was a law on the provider‚Äôs unreasonableness for content. <br><br>  And it turned out to be a successful scheme.  After all, users are ready to "buy" products at the price of delivery. <br>  Now your main question is whether ‚Äútraffic‚Äù pays off. <br><br>  1. However, there is just huge amounts of traffic. <br>  2. Is it really kicks off paid accounts? <br>  A little mixed concepts.  For a free user there is a VERY limited amount of traffic.  And clearly controlled.  100MB per hour, for example from a single IP.  And his dick get around. <br>  Because  the cost of the file is not commensurate with what Rapid is asking for - Western users are happy to pay. <br>  Rapida also has a very good referral system.  For N thousand downloads, the file-hosted receives a sufficient number of points to buy a premium account (which he can then sell to someone else) <br><br>  Summarizing.  There is a rule of 1-9-90.  1% produces, 9% distribute, 90% only consume content.  Rapida successfully works in the field of 9%, while 90% of consumers pay for everything.  With huge volumes of traffic, the price per gigabyte of both traffic and space is significantly reduced.  The owner Rapida in any way has a nemeryannoy dough :-).  At the same time, he still has a lot of monetization options - for example, advertising sales. <br><br>  The same depositfiles for example live at the expense of advertising and visitors, and not for subscriptions.  Subscriptions hardly beat off the affiliate program, as I understand it. <br><br>  The end.  Have questions?  :-) <br><hr><br>  For some reason he had no questions.  If you have what additions, clarifications to this material or want to discuss - I'm ready :-). </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/20193/">https://habr.com/ru/post/20193/</a></p>
