      There is a lot of joy from new operating systems, but for me, as an information technology professional, the release of new operating systems also means the early release of new certifications and their respective exams ‚Äî I wanted to talk about this topic in more detail today. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  First of all, I would like to remind you that relatively recently, <a href="http://ww.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/certification/cert-overview.aspx">changes have</a> occurred <a href="http://ww.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/certification/cert-overview.aspx">in the certification system</a> for Microsoft products for IT professionals. <br>  The most current scheme is shown in the figure below: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d93/159/ebf/d93159ebf5fd025f7412842b18c9b21d.jpg"><br><br>  And so that there is no confusion between the MCITP and the MCSE, I‚Äôll clarify: <br><br>  The first version of MCSA / MCSE was a long time ago and was deciphered as Microsoft Certified Systems Administrator / Engineer and belonged to the products of Windows NT4.0 / 2000/2003.  There were also specialization in additional technologies - Internet (IIS-server), Messaging (Exchange) and Security (ISA). <br>  For specialists in the field of DBMS was a separate status - MCDBA, Microsoft Certified Data Base Administrator. <br>  For the Windows XP client system, a separate status was introduced for HelpDesk specialists - MCDST, Microsoft Certified Desktop Support Techician. <br><br>  The next evolution was to transform the certification system and replace MCSA and MCSE with MCTS and MCITP, Microsoft Certified Technology Specialist and Microsoft Certified IT Professional, respectively. <br>  The specifics of this action was that the certification became more specialized, narrow and tailored for specific products and solutions.  Based on this logic, MCSA and MCSE were replaced by MCITP: Server Administrator and MCITP: Enterprise Administrator.  Touzhe take into account comprehend the status of MCDBA - it was replaced by the MCITP: Database Administrator.  For client OSs, two MCITP statuses also appeared: Consumer Support Technician and Enterprise Support Technician for Windows Vista.  For Windows 7, the following MCITP statuses appeared even later: Enterprise Desktop Administrator on Windows 7 and Enterprise Desktop Support Technician on Windows 7. <br><br>  And finally, after some time, the MCITP statuses were supplemented with the revised MCSA and MCSE statuses, which changed the meaning of their abbreviations to Microsoft Certified Solutions Associate and Microsoft Certified Solutions Expert.  As stated in the Microsoft message, the new ‚Äúold‚Äù certifications were specially developed for the cloud era, since the use and development of cloud infrastructures seems to be more likely and natural.  However, the statuses of MCTS and MCITP promised to leave as specialization in individual products and technologies.  However, with the announcement of Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012, new certifications for these products were announced.  Next, let's take a closer look at the new tracks and exams on the newest operating systems and technologies from Microsoft. <br><br><h1>  <b>New MCSA and MCSE tracks: what and how</b> </h1><br><br><h2>  <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/certification/cert-private-cloud.aspx">MCSE: Private Cloud</a> </h2><br><br>  First of all, I would like to tell you more about the very first new MCSE certification - Private Cloud: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ced/6c8/19f/ced6c819fd0a6ffe8bc46ce73da9d33f.png"><br><br>  If we recall the near past a bit, the System Center product family was completely updated at the beginning of April - now the product family has received a single version of <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/server-cloud/system-center/default.aspx">System Center 2012</a> for all. <br>  This product bundle, although externally sharpened for a new server operating system, will only support it with SP1, which is now in the CTP state.  Therefore, if you want to practice on the basis of the new Windows Server 2012 with the RTM version of System Center 2012, nothing will work out for you. <br>  <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx%3Fid%3D29099">CTP version of System Center 2012 SP1 is available here</a> . <br><br>  To become an expert on a private cloud based on Microsoft products, you must fulfill the following requirements: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/certification/cert-windowsserver-all.aspx">MICTP: Server Administrator or MCITP: Enterprise Administrator</a> (These statuses were equated to the requirement for obtaining <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/certification/cert-windows-server-2008-MCSA.aspx">MCSA: Windows Server 2008</a> ) </li><li>  Pass <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/exam.aspx%3FID%3D70-246">70-246</a> exam <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/exam.aspx%3FID%3D70-246">: Monitoring and Operating a Private Cloud with System Center 2012</a> </li><li>  Pass the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/exam.aspx%3FID%3D70-247">70-247</a> exam <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/exam.aspx%3FID%3D70-247">: Configuring and Deploying a Private Cloud with System Center 2012</a> (Until January 31, 2013, exam <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/exam.aspx%3FID%3D70-659">70-659</a> counts for this requirement) </li></ul><br><br><br>  I want to note that I have passed all exams, including 70-659 - so I had to pass the exam 70-246 to get the cloud status - I passed the beta exam numbered 71-246 (all the Microsoft <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/certification/exam-dev.aspx">beta exams</a> are numbered "71-XXX") and now I am waiting for the results (smile). <br><br>  To prepare for these exams, 246 and 247, you must deploy all the components of System Center 2012 and configure them to work properly using System Center Orchestrator. <br>  For successful completion, 3 months of dense work with a family is necessary, at a minimum. <br><br><h2>  <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/certification/cert-sql-server-data-platform.aspx">MCSE: Data Platform</a> </h2><br><br>  New status in the field of DBMS is also focused on the latest version of the product - <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/sqlserver/en/us/default.aspx">Microsoft SQL Server 2012</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f3d/63b/d12/f3d63bd123fad25849e70138c52e887a.png"><br><br>  So, in order to get the title of experts in the field of building and implementing data platforms based on SQL Server 2012, you must fulfill the following requirements: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/certification/exam-dev.aspx">MCSA: SQL Server 2012</a> </li><li>  Pass <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/exam.aspx%3FID%3D70-464">70-464</a> exam <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/exam.aspx%3FID%3D70-464">: Developing Microsoft SQL Server 2012 Databases</a> </li><li>  Pass Exam <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/exam.aspx%3FID%3D70-465">70-465: Designing Database Solutions for Microsoft SQL Server 2012</a> </li></ul><br><br>  Also, if you have the title MCITP: Database Developer or MCITP: Database Administrator for the SQL version 2008, then there is the possibility of an upgrade: <br><br><ul><li>  Pass the exam 70-457 </li><li>  Pass the exam 70-458 </li><li>  Pass the exam 70-459 </li></ul><br><br>  Unfortunately, there is no further information on upgrades for upgrades at the time of writing the post ... <br><br>  Many will ask: "What is MCSA and where to get it?".  The answer to this question I will give a little later, when we will disassemble the tracks MCSA. <br><br><h2>  <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/certification/cert-sql-server-business-intelligence.aspx">MCSE: Business Intelligence</a> </h2><br><br>  If you are a specialist in business intelligence (who I am not), then you will be interested in MCSE: Business Intelligence certification. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/8c7/f00/ede/8c7f00edea4fa49c4dda14fe155d6d39.png"><br><br>  In order to become an expert in this particular area, you will have to pass the following tests: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/certification/exam-dev.aspx">MCSA: SQL Server 2012</a> </li><li>  Pass Exam <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/exam.aspx%3FID%3D70-466">70-466: Implementing Data Models and Reports with Microsoft SQL Server 2012</a> </li><li>  Pass the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/exam.aspx%3FID%3D70-467">70-467</a> exam <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/exam.aspx%3FID%3D70-467">: Designing Business Intelligence Solutions with Microsoft SQL Server 2012</a> </li></ul><br><br>  To upgrade from MCITP: Business Intelligence 2008 to MCSE, you will have to master the following 3 exams: <br><br><ul><li>  Turn in 70-457 </li><li>  Turn in 70-458 </li><li>  Turn in 70-460 </li></ul><br><br>  As it will be easy to guess, there is no more detailed information on this upgrade yet. <br><br><h2>  <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/certification/mcse-server-infrastructure.aspx">MCSE: Server Infrastructure</a> </h2><br><br>  Well, finally, we have come to the OS itself - server and client. <br>  Let's begin, perhaps, with a server OS - Windows Server 2012. <br>  The new status is called Server Infrastructure or ‚ÄúServer Infrastructure‚Äù - that is, the scope here is still more on the classic implementation of the infrastructure than on the cloud infrastructure ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/705/ab1/fd4/705ab1fd4648a667a0d316e0ddddf0bd.png"><br><br>  In fact, these are new exams for a new server OS, analogs of previous versions. <br>  To obtain the MCSE: Server Infrastructure status, you must meet the following minimum: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/certification/cert-windows-server-MCSA.aspx">MCSA: Windows Server 2012</a> </li><li>  Pass the exam 70-413 </li><li>  Pass the exam 70-414 </li></ul><br><br>  More detailed information on the 413 and 414 exams is not yet available, but they appear somewhere in September-October, closer to the release of the new system. <br>  However, exams for MCSA status will be available earlier, in more detail - a little further. <br><br>  To upgrade, you must have one of the following statuses: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/certification/cert-windows-server-2008-MCSA.aspx">MCSA: Windows Server 2008</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/certification/cert-virtualization.aspx">MCITP: Virtualization Administrator</a> ( <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/exam.aspx%3FID%3D70-659">70-659</a> + <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/exam.aspx%3FID%3D70-669">70-669</a> + <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/exam.aspx%3FID%3D70-693">70-693</a> ) </li><li>  <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/certification/cert-exchange-server.aspx">MCITP: Enterprise Messaging Administrator</a> ( <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/exam.aspx%3FID%3D70-662">70-662</a> + <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/exam.aspx%3FID%3D70-663">70-663</a> ) </li><li>  <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/certification/cert-lync-server.aspx">MCITP: Lync Server Administrator</a> ( <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/exam.aspx%3FID%3D70-664">70-664</a> + <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/exam.aspx%3FID%3D70-665">70-665</a> ) </li><li>  <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/certification/cert-sharepoint-server.aspx">MCITP: SharePoint Administrator</a> ( <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/exam.aspx%3FID%3D70-667">70-667</a> + <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/exam.aspx%3FID%3D70-668">70-668</a> ) </li><li>  <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/certification/cert-windowsclient.aspx">MCITP: Enterprise Desktop Administrator</a> ( <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/exam.aspx%3FID%3D70-680">70-680</a> + <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/exam.aspx%3FID%3D70-686">70-686</a> ) </li></ul><br><br>  In addition to any of the above statuses, the following requirements must be met: <br><br><ul><li>  Pass the exam 70-417 (Get the status of <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/certification/cert-windows-server-MCSA.aspx">MCSA: Windows Server 2012</a> ) </li><li>  Pass the exam 70-413 </li><li>  Pass the exam 70-414 </li></ul><br><br>  With the upgrade and its details, the story is identical to the previous statuses. <br><br><h2>  <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/certification/mcse-desktop-infrastructure.aspx">MCSE: Desktop Infrastructure</a> </h2><br><br>  Well, the last of the statuses known to me, MCSE: Desktop Infrrastructure.  It focuses, as you might guess, on the client OS, applications, how to deploy them, and user environments. <br>  Here you need to have experience with both Windows 8 and MDT of the latest version, as well as with RDS services. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c2f/5a7/8e8/c2f5a78e838725a434d8cfceddaa63df.png"><br><br>  To obtain this status, you must fulfill the following requirements: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/certification/cert-windows-server-MCSA.aspx">MCSA: Windows Server 2012</a> </li><li>  Pass the exam 70-415 </li><li>  Pass the exam 70-416 </li></ul><br><br>  To upgrade, you need the following: <br><br><ul><li>  Pass the exam 70-417 (Get the status of <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/certification/cert-windows-server-MCSA.aspx">MCSA: Windows Server 2012</a> ) </li><li>  Pass the exam 70-415 </li><li>  Pass the exam 70-416 </li></ul><br><br>  Actually the upgrade is not much different from the "zero" status.  The prerequisite here is the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/certification/cert-windowsclient.aspx">MCITP: Enterprise Desktop Administrator</a> . <br><br><h2>  <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/certification/cert-windows-server-2008-MCSA.aspx">MCSA: Windows Server 2008</a> </h2><br>  Everything is quite simple here - if you have <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/certification/cert-windowsserver-all.aspx">MCITP: Server Administrator or MCITP: Enterprise Administrator</a> , then you should have received this status automatically. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ad7/bed/881/ad7bed881c1d279ccb4c628594443d85.png"><br><br>  If to be more specific, then you need to strain and: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/exam.aspx%3FID%3D70-640">Pass 70-640 exam</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/exam.aspx%3FID%3D70-642">Pass the 70-642 exam</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/exam.aspx%3FID%3D70-646">Pass 70-646 exam</a> </li></ul><br><br>  These are all requirements for this status. <br><br><h2>  <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/certification/cert-sql-server-MCSA.aspx">MCSA: SQL Server 2008</a> </h2><br><br>  Quite a strange status, given the fact that everything that could be invented in SQL 2008 was already invented.  But no, we decided to make a semi-admin and semi-developer status, judge for yourself according to the requirements: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/exam.aspx%3FID%3D70-640">Pass the exam 70-432</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/exam.aspx%3FID%3D70-640">Pass the exam 70-448</a> </li></ul><br><br>  About this status is very short - everything. <br><br><h2>  <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/certification/cert-windows-server-MCSA.aspx">MCSA: Windows Server 2012</a> </h2><br><br>  Perhaps the main focus in the near future should be on this status. <br>  Firstly, there are known exams for passing and there is a record for the beta exam, which means that now you can prepare and see what will happen in the real exam, well, if you successfully pass and get a tick in the list of necessary exams, namely: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/exam.aspx%3FID%3D70-410">Pass the exam 70-410</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/exam.aspx%3FID%3D70-411">Pass the exam 70-411</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/exam.aspx%3FID%3D70-412">Pass the exam 70-412</a> </li></ul><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a84/306/748/a843067487f83987a8d20714d77a84aa.png"><br><br>  These are all necessary exams to get the most current and real status on Windows Server 2012 to date.  To upgrade, you must have the status of MCSA: Windows Server 2008 and pass the exam 70-417. <br><br><h2>  <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/certification/cert-sql-server-mcsa.aspx">MCSA: SQL Server 2012</a> </h2><br><br>  Well, this status is the most relevant and real for the newest DBMS. <br>  A very big emphasis in this status is placed on the creation and management of cloud and hybrid configurations of a SQL server.  The lion's share of questions is directed to this (I speak as a person who has passed the beta exams).  Get ready !!! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/77d/112/028/77d112028af096067cce1549d61afd4e.png"><br><br>  Here is the required list of exams: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/exam.aspx%3FID%3D70-461">Pass the exam 70-461</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/exam.aspx%3FID%3D70-462">Pass the exam 70-462</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/exam.aspx%3FID%3D70-463">Pass the exam 70-463</a> </li></ul><br><br>  To upgrade, you need to get any MCTS status on SQL Server 2008 and do it like this: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/exam.aspx%3FID%3D70-457">Pass the exam 70-457</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/exam.aspx%3FID%3D70-458">Pass the exam 70-458</a> </li></ul><br><br>  This is all about SQL and statuses and exams known to me. <br>  But finally, I would like to tell a little bit about beta exams and ‚Äúhidden‚Äù certifications and statuses. <br>  They are on the Microsoft Learning site, but you need to get to them (smile). <br><br><h2>  <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/certification/exam-dev.aspx">Beta Exams</a> and Unannounced MCSA </h2><br><br>  What is a beta exam: <br><br>  Like any product, you must first fill the exam with content, then test it, check the quality of the content and set the grading scale.  It is for this purpose that the beta exams are used - these are preliminary versions of the exams before their official release.  Such exams have the prefix "071" (and not "070").  In order to be able to pass beta exams, you need to <a href="https://connect.microsoft.com/Survey/SurveyList.aspx%3FSiteID%3D862">fill out an SME profile</a> and select those products in the profile that you are interested in passing (I select all products). <br>  As a rule, before the beta period begins, you will receive an email with a promotional code for the exam (yes, this is free of charge in most cases). <br>  Another way is to monitor the <a href="http://www.prometric.com/">Prometric</a> portal and watch the exams by code, see the exam from 71-XXX - and here it is beta, as in the figure below: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/869/e4f/a7d/869e4fa7dbe0f8cdbf6ed14eb97f2e5a.png"><br><br>  As you can see, beta exams for Windows Server 2012 are now available - <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/exam.aspx%3FID%3D70-410">71-410</a> , <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/exam.aspx%3FID%3D70-480">71-480</a> for HTML5 and CSS3 and for Windows 8 ... <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/exam.aspx%3FID%3D70-687">71-687</a> - an exam that prepares for MCSA status: Windows 8. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/24f/01b/eb4/24f01beb4e4531c92691a0369b3b16ce.png"><br><br>  Information about the status of MCSA: Windows 8, I did not find, exactly how I do not know whether the exam 70-687 is the only requirement to obtain it or not.  Status puzzle ... <br>  However, I registered for all these beta (except for 71-480 - I‚Äôm not a duplo, forgive). <br><br>  With this, I would like to complete my review of new statuses and exams - it is very superficial and its purpose was to give an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhat awaits us in the near future. <br>  I hope this post will be useful for you and will help you navigate the future professional development. <br><br>  I wish you every success on your professional path, <br><br>  Respectfully, <br>  George A.
