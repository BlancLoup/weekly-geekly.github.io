But I would like to make sure that they are all really so wise that <br>  right worthy of taking place in it.  Offer them a test that they could only do if <br>  if each one of them shows true wisdom. <br>  ‚ÄúGood,‚Äù said Sayid.  - Call your council.  And order to find 12 gems and 12 boxes. <br>  When the Council of the Wise gathered, Sayid got down to business: <br>  - Honorable members of the Council of the Wise!  Before each of you the servants put on the box.  I will ask you for <br>  leave the hall for a minute and at this time put one of the precious stones in his box - either a ruby ‚Äã‚Äãor <br>  emerald.  All the others, except the one who has come out, will see me putting it in his box. <br>  Said put the first one a ruby, the second and the third - emeralds.  When the last sage returned to the hall, Said <br>  said: <br>  - Each of you knows who I put a stone.  Each of you do not know what is in his box.  But <br>  if you are truly wise, and your eyes and memory do not deny you, then silent thinking will help you to carry out my <br>  request: Let all those who are entitled to the emerald, put their boxes in front of the Great Vizir. <br>  The wise men stood silently, and none of them moved.  The Grand Vizier became furious: <br>  - Yes, they are not worthy to be in my Council of the Wise!  Guardian!  Banish them from the palace! <br>  ‚ÄúTake your time,‚Äù said the Great Vizier Said.  - In their place, I behaved exactly the same. <br>  Ten minutes later, Said repeated his request: ‚ÄúEveryone who has emeralds in caskets, put the caskets in front of <br>  Great Vizir! ‚ÄùAnd again, no one took a single step.  Every ten minutes, Said again and again uttered his request. <br>  The Grand Vizier frowned, his face expressing displeasure and disappointment.  After asking for the first time <br>  Sayid, it's been a full hour.  And then among the wise men suddenly began to move.  Part of them moved to the Great Vizier and with <br>  With a bow she placed her caskets at his feet.  Vizier opened them - there were emeralds.  And in the caskets of those who stayed on <br>  their places were only rubies. <br>  - O Great Vizier!  You can be proud: your Council consists of people who are worthy of the title of sages!  - <br>  the wisest of the wisest congratulated Vizier and left the palace. <br>  How many emeralds put into a casket Said?  How did the wise men guess which stone is lying <br>  each of them <br><br><h5>  I am sure that many will guess before the decision.  It is worth noting that the task contains a small error, however, some exotic ways to get around this still exist, so we will score.

      <b>Now you can go to the dessert</b> </h5><br><br>  One island is inhabited by a tribe whose members have only blue-eyed or with brown eyes.  A total of 1,000 people live on the island (of which 100 are blue-eyed and 900 brown-eyed).  All of them, as one, adhere to a religion that strictly forbids them to know the color of their eyes (they never look at mirrors or water) or discuss the color of the eyes of anyone on the island.  Each of them knows the color of the eyes of everyone else, except himself, and if he suddenly finds out the color of his eyes, he is obliged, by his religion, to commit a public ritual suicide in the square in front of the whole island, in the near afternoon. <br><br>  One day, a traveler from distant countries arrives on the island, and soon becomes friends with all the inhabitants of the island, who completely trust him in everything. <br><br>  One evening, he convenes them all to say goodbye and thank them for their hospitality.  At the end of his speech, he notices, in particular, that for him - and he has blue eyes - it was a pleasant surprise to find a blue-eyed islander in this part of the world. <br><br>  Question: what happens after this statement? <br><br><h5>  I do not know whether to lay out the decision, or wait for some time and edit the post. <br>  But in any case, I am waiting for your comments. <br>  <i>And I beg you, if you have somewhere found a solution to the problem, or are confident that you have correctly decided - do not spoil the opportunity for others to reach it on their own.</i> </h5><br><br>  Update: <br>  <a href="http://my-tribune.blogspot.com/2010/01/blog-post_20.html">my-tribune.blogspot.com/2010/01/blog-post_20.html</a> <br>  <a href="http://einwill.livejournal.com/64575.html">einwill.livejournal.com/64575.html</a> <br>  <a href="http://avva.livejournal.com/1873907.html">avva.livejournal.com/1873907.html</a> <br><br>  Have a nice evening. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/115437/">https://habr.com/ru/post/115437/</a></p>
