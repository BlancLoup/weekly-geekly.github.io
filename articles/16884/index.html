  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What do venture funds want to see in a startup business plan</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> <em>I continue to publish some materials from my <a href="http://www.ideablog.ru/">IdeaBlog.ru</a> blog, dedicated to venture investments, venture investors and startups.</em> <em><br><br></em>  <em><u><strong>A small announcement:</strong></u> an article titled ‚Äú <a href="http://www.ideablog.ru/2007/11/28/39/"><strong>Investor Profile: Finam Venture Fund. Dmitry Rodionov,</strong></a> ‚Äù in which, based on an interview with the project manager (venture investments) of the Investment Center for High technologies of the Finam company Dmitry Rodionov, the investment preferences of the venture fund of the Finam company, its requirements for projects and project teams are revealed, it is said for what reasons most applicants for investments are eliminated, etc.</em> <br><br>  When a start-up thinks about attracting foreign investment, there is always the question of preparing a business plan - in his absence, it is possible to talk with investors, maybe it can, but it will not go further.  Many people believe that a business plan for a startup, especially one that is at the <a href="http://www.ideablog.ru/2007/11/18/17/">pre-startup stage of development,</a> is a fiction that it is not necessary to do it, and if you do, you can get by with formal words.  However, such startups remain, as a rule, without investment.  Unless, of course, they attacked some sucker investor: one of the successful Russian startups told me that among the business angels to whom he presented the project in cooperation with one of the Russian networks of business angels were mistresses oligarchs - ‚Äúreal blondes‚Äù, according to him, - which their sponsors gave money to buy business and do business, rather than take the brain out of their ‚Äúdaddies‚Äù from idleness;  so to such ‚Äúinvestors‚Äù, according to this start-up, it was more important that the start-up himself liked, not the project.  However, all other investors will need your business plan, and they will study it very seriously.  They need this document even not so much for the payback figures that you give there, but to understand how deeply you have studied the market in which you are going to act and whether your product / service will be in demand by your target audience, which should bring money to a startup.  Therefore, the preparation of a business plan should be taken very, very seriously.  This document is primarily a kind of questionnaire for you - have you studied the market enough, have you thought about everything in your project?  Personally, I am always on my new projects - no matter whether I intend to attract investments or not - before starting their implementation, I draw up a business plan - and always with numbers.  For myself and for a better understanding of what I want, what I have to do and whether I can do it myself or I have to attract someone.  In 99% of cases, the amounts that initially seem to be sufficient for the implementation of the project, increase by 2-3 times - due to the reflection on those little things, which, as is known, the business develops. <a name="habracut"></a>

      Nevertheless, business plans for startups who want to see venture capital funds are slightly different from standard business plans that can be found on the Internet.  First of all, the fact that venture funds need accents, placed slightly elsewhere.  Therefore, the following structure of a business plan contains requirements that venture funds place on such documents.  The above document, in particular, was compiled by the <a href="http://www.allianzrosno.ru/">venture fund ‚ÄúAlliance ROSNO Asset Management‚Äù</a> , but other venture funds will be satisfied if you submit them a business plan that exhaustively describes all the points mentioned below.  For the next couple of weeks, I will devote a detailed <a href="http://www.ideablog.ru/">breakdown of</a> each item on the <a href="http://www.ideablog.ru/">IdeaBlog.ru</a> blog, which needs to be described in the business plan (and which you need to know for yourself!), Illustrating this with examples, including from personal experience. <br><br>  The structure and content of the business plan submitted to venture funds <br><br>  <strong>Executive Summary of the Project</strong> <br><br>  * Size and market opportunities <br><br>  Here it is necessary to describe the size, dynamics and possibilities of the existing market of the proposed product or service.
