Students trained in these programs will receive detailed information about the methods and means of organizing Big Data, as well as using Big Data to make weighted business decisions. <br><br>  According to experts, by 2015 around the world, 4.4 million jobs will be created for specialists in the field of Big Data.  The demand for professionals with similar knowledge and skills is due to the dynamic growth of information in the world.  Already, various sensors, RFID tags, mobile devices and social networks generate 2.5 billion gigabytes of data daily.  As a result, companies operating in various industries around the world are experiencing a shortage of specialists who could extract valuable information from a vast array of data.  The presence of such specialists contributes to the company's competitiveness, its entry into new markets and overcoming the existing difficulties in the work.

    <a name="habracut"></a>  <b>Moscow State University named after M.V.</b>  <b>Lomonosov</b> on the basis of the Faculty of Computational Mathematics and Cybernetics (VMC) launches the master program "Big Data: Infrastructures and Methods for Solving Problems".  The goal of the program is to prepare masters specializing in the design and use of scalable infrastructures for working with Big Data, as well as creating and using methods for solving problems of analyzing Big Data in such infrastructures (in the world this specialization is called ‚Äúdata science‚Äù).  A special place in the program is occupied by mastering the methods of formulating and solving problems in areas with intensive use of data aimed at accelerating research and based on tools for working with Big Data.  The program makes extensive use of the latest technologies for working with IBM Big Data. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe avalanche growth of data and the lack of specialists in working with Big Data require educational institutions to develop modern training courses that aim to train highly qualified specialists in this field,‚Äù said Mikhail V. Fedotov, Deputy Dean for Academic Work at the Faculty of Computational Mathematics and Cybernetics of Moscow State University.  ‚ÄúWe are confident that the master‚Äôs program developed by us will be in demand among students and will allow them to gain knowledge that will later come in handy in finding employment.‚Äù <br><br>  <b>The Higher School of Economics</b> on the basis of the Faculty of Business Informatics launched in 2014 the Master's program ‚ÄúBig Data Systems‚Äù.  The peculiarity of this program is that it focuses on the use of technology to make informed business decisions.  This program consists of two blocks - technological and managerial.  Students participating in the program can form their own set of courses from these blocks that will correspond to their interests in this field.  The main disciplines offered by the program include system analysis and organization structure;  mathematical and economic modeling;  Big Data analysis and integration, etc.  The development of this master's program, combining technical skills in the field of Big Data and related business skills, received the prestigious IBM Faculty Awards in 2013. <br><br>  ‚ÄúBig Data has changed familiar ideas about information, its management methods, its values ‚Äã‚Äãand meaning.  They also changed the perception of automation, quality and speed of decision making.  Their direct impact on efficiency, competitiveness and business organization models will grow with the advent of new principles and technologies for obtaining and processing data ", - commented Svetlana Maltseva, dean of the Faculty of Business Informatics at the HSE. Only to apply the Big Data technologies, but also to see new tasks for which they can be used. We laid the foundation of our master program  el many years of successful experience in training specialists in the sphere of information technologies for business. " <br><br>  ‚ÄúIn the context of the active development and growth of technology areas such as Big Data, analytics, cloud technologies and social interaction, leading companies and educational institutions should actively participate in the development of new skills that future professionals should have,‚Äù says Sergey Belov, coordinator of university programs IBM in Russia and the CIS, in the countries of the Middle East and Africa.  "To reduce the existing gap between market expectations and existing academic programs, IBM actively collaborates with leading universities in Russia and around the world, providing teachers and students with access to their technologies and products in the field of Big Data." </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/243577/">https://habr.com/ru/post/243577/</a></p>
