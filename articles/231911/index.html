  <section class="page js-page"><h1>5 ways to keep call center customers</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <i>Is there a connection between having a customer experience with a call center and their satisfaction and loyalty?</i>  <i>If so, can the company increase customer loyalty with additional investments in customer retention tools?</i> <br><br>  If these questions disturb you, be aware there is a positive answer. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The study was devoted to analyzing whether loyalty and customer satisfaction with experience in dealing with a call center is related to a company or to goods and services.  On the issue of satisfaction and loyalty to the company were interviewed customers who have already had experience with its call center. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      The result clearly showed that as soon as customer satisfaction with the call center grows, their desire to make another purchase and recommend this brand to their friends increases proportionally.  In addition to this, it should be noted that the likelihood of a customer leaving for another seller is reduced. <br><br>  Research has shown that an effective customer retention strategy is key to increasing their loyalty with satisfaction.  From this it follows that call center managers and marketers should pay close attention to improving the functionality of the call center and use different methods of customer retention. <br><br>  Companies choosing a call center for outsourcing should be more demanding in their choice, as this directly affects customer retention. <br><br>  When choosing a contact center for outsourcing or purchasing it, make sure that you consider the following points: <br><br><ul><li>  Do not save on call center quality: </li></ul><br><br>  By saving a few dollars on quality, you risk your brand, which directly affects your reputation and sales. <br><br><ul><li>  Pay due attention to the training of operators: </li></ul><br><br>  Impeccable knowledge of the products, sincere empathy with each client communication, all this comes with experience, but at the same time can be achieved in a relatively short period of time with the help of high-quality training.  Provide the best training for your employees, and they will look like experienced professionals in the eyes of your clients. <br><br><ul><li>  Minimize operator response time: </li></ul><br><br>  Nothing is more annoying to a client than an infinitely long wait for a response from a call center operator.  Never force a client to wait for an answer for more than a few minutes, unless in exceptional cases, give him the opportunity to state his question as soon as possible. <br><br><ul><li>  Take adequate corrective action: </li></ul><br><br>  In case the client wants to talk to the supervisor, ensure that the problem is resolved in the best possible way. <br><br><ul><li>  Treat your call center staff well: </li></ul><br><br>  The staff of your call center is the point of contact for your company with the outside world, so the client must feel the benevolent moral atmosphere of your company when solving his problem.  Operators play a vital role in the success of your contact center, so it is important to treat them well, and this will positively affect the results of their work. <br><br>  If the client is satisfied with the work of your call center, he will definitely return to you and retain loyalty to your company. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/231911/">https://habr.com/ru/post/231911/</a></p>
