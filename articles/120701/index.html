Bush meant or the star wars in the IT world - ‚Äúthe second coming of Apple‚Äù</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The title of the article, in terms of the mention of George W. Bush, has no direct relation to its content, it‚Äôs just that this man raised the flag of the fight against world evil at the level of the entire globe.  I am afraid that, as usual, the witch hunt was spent in vain, and most of the evil was in America itself.  Below I will acquaint you with the reasons for such conclusions on the examples of Apple, Oracle, 1C, Google, Adobe companies. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Preamble </h4><br>  The eternal question is what is evil and what is good.  The answer to it can be given only by the one who raised this question - a person.  The man came up with such a concept as the world, and the man came up with a weapon. <br><br>  Initially, the weapon was needed only for self-defense and for hunting, in order to feed and, accordingly, live. <br>  However, there were people who began to use weapons for other purposes.  And directed him against their own kind.  Their problem was that they did not know how or did not want to live and cherish ordinary and simple human values.

      Such people form the ‚Äúaxis of evil‚Äù all over the world and we will call them ‚Äúbad people‚Äù in this article. <br><br>  Today, weapons are different.  However, the most powerful modern weapon is information technology (IT).  It is also the most unexplored, and therefore very dangerous weapon.  Very few people have a good understanding of the essence of information technology.  However, there are those who have mastered the knowledge of IT.  These people have learned how to create IT products and make money from them.  Sometimes VERY big money. <br><br>  Global companies consist primarily of people.  All these people are different.  The companies are also headed by people who are fully responsible for the activities of their companies. <br><br>  There are very few people who are extremely bad (Hitler) or extremely good (Dalai Lama), the majority is a combination of these qualities.  The controlling stake is 51%.  Therefore, it is so difficult to understand on whose side the one who stands before you. <br><br>  However, time puts everything in its place.  It allows the method of long-term observation to understand who is on whose side. <br><br>  I propose to open the White and Black Books, which will list the companies, facts and evidence that reveal the true identity of IT companies.  These books should be posted online.  For their support, a UN type organization should be responsible with a core committee consisting of IT specialists and prominent figures from different countries.  They should be officially recognized part, which is issued by the editors and undergoes a certain process of control.  There should also be an informal part.  It will be completely open, such as WIKI. <br><br><h4>  Let's start with the good.  White paper </h4><br>  <b>Steve JOBS, head of APPLE</b> , in my opinion, has every right to take the first line in this book.  The merit of this person is that the declared and embodied mission of their business lies in two words - IT products for humans.  The company realized that it should offer completely new, not connected by any ideology with products of the past, ready devices and software for them, designed to serve people.  The iPad is just another consistent step to getting IT to serve ordinary people.  Not to require special knowledge from them, to be always near, not to spoil health, etc.  The company's advantage is also that it earns well and invests the money earned in the practical implementation of the right ideas and concepts. <br><br>  <b>Larry Ellison, the head of Oracle</b> , in my opinion, is not perfectly clean, but the white side in it definitely prevails.  Oracle today is the number one company for business.  And business is all the same people.  Oracle supports open source technologies, such as Java.  Oracle allows you to download ANY products from their sites to try and even illegally use them, no matter how many hundreds of thousands of dollars they cost.  Oracle thereby trusts people, it leaves it to them to decide how many products and services to buy and when. <br><br>  Oracle bought a lot of companies, in particular, SUN - a company of 100% of the bright side.  Oracle has taken the right step - it gives its customers the opportunity to get a complete solution from one source.  But it becomes like a monopolist and may turn out to be too large and uncontrollable.  Oracle has combined too many different solutions, so it must be extremely careful. <br><br>  Today, Oracle makes some serious mistakes.  I have to talk about them, because their awareness will benefit the Oracle itself, because knowledge is power. <br><br>  <u>Error 1.</u> Oracle does not offer a start-up business a complete solution that is necessary for simple financial management and control of business processes. <br><br>  Considering that Oracle is the number one business company, I was interested in whether the entire business was covered by complete Oracle solutions.  My questions: ‚ÄúHow do you define your client?‚Äù, I heard the answers: ‚ÄúOur clients are companies with a turnover of over $ 25 million a year‚Äù or ‚ÄúSmall business is such companies for which we do not have a dedicated manager ".  Alas, but the number one company for business does not understand the simple thing - ANY BUSINESS AT THE BEGINNING OF YOUR WAY IS SMALL.  He, like any child, requires attention, and it should be properly educated.  Oracle tacitly allows bad people to raise children at random, and then, when the child is strong, got up and begins to swear, Oracle says to him: ‚Äúcome to me, forget everything you were taught, and I will tell you how to live correctly "And the child is likely to send it to all four sides ... <br><br>  The conclusion is simple: Oracle should update its strategy in providing On Demand access services to simple and understandable solutions for small and start-up businesses based on their best technologies! <br><br>  <u>Error 2.</u> Oracle is trying to make absolutely everything.  Even on education. <br>  According to the latest data, in 2009, Oracle sold products and services for a support of at least $ 20 billion. In parallel, Oracle sells universities a subscription to access training programs at $ 500 a year.  According to published data for 2009, 3,600 universities acquired this subscription, i.e.  Oracle sold these services for $ 2 million. But what about the other tens of thousands of universities that produce hundreds of thousands of students ??? <br>  They do not master Oracle products!  And Oracle loses billions of dollars when it tries to earn only a couple of millions from education.  WHERE IS LOGIC, GOD ORACLE STRATEGY?  Oracle must update its strategy for distributing its best educational materials and pay university professors who include these materials in a general free educational program!  In the near future, this will bring new billions of dollars in profits, will allow more students to master Oracle technologies, and small businesses will be able to work with the best technologies for business from the first day of their work. <br><br>  <u>Error 3.</u> Oracle sells in different countries only through partners, while the offices in most countries are sales offices and no more.  Work with partners is based mainly on the organization of sales.  Development assistance is provided only in the form of rare free technology seminars or web-inars.  Certification is expensive and complicated. <br><br>  Oracle must understand that B2B is always more risky than B2C.  For example, during the years of the financial crisis, it was the Retail-market that survived because its clients, individuals, continued to consume food, etc.  For WORK (AND NOT ONLY FOR SALES OF PRODUCTS) only through partners, each country should have a head office, WITH A LOCALIZED ACTIVITY STRATEGY, regulating partners, controlling the quality of services provided, conducting customer surveys on the degree of satisfaction, etc.  So far this is not in the CIS countries! <br><br>  If Oracle understands its mistakes, it will allow it to really bypass such monsters as IBM. <br><br>  <b>Google</b> ... Who's next? <br><br>  Of course, these are not ideal companies, and they also make mistakes.  It is absolutely natural.  As I have already said, any company consists primarily of people, and people tend to make mistakes.  The human factor is nowhere to be excluded.  Even at the highest level.  Recall with regret about the incident with the aircraft of the Polish president in April 2010.  No matter which service failed - inside the plane or on the ground.  The mistake was made by someone from the people. <br><br><h4>  Now about the bad.  Black book. </h4><br>  <b>Microsoft.</b>  It is not clear who now heads it.  Bill Gates once again proved that he is quite an intelligent man.  Therefore, he moved away from the management of the company, which today operates on the dark side. <br>  How can we determine the prevalence of dark forces in Microsoft: <br><br>  Microsoft is a worldwide monopolist.  It has long been known to all that monopoly is evil.  The true mission of this company is only in one thing - to make money.  Keys to software products, high prices, anti-competitive antics, etc.  All this has only one goal - to increase revenues. <br><br>  In some countries, Microsoft ships all its products through a single channel.  If it fails, Microsoft waits until this channel resumes.  She does not care that the channel may be blocked for several months, and consumers will not be able to receive software products during this period.  Microsoft is not interested in consumers.  It is occupied by its own corporate interests and the interests of its commercial partners. <br><br>  Windows remains Windows and has not changed for many years!  Ordinary people actually zombie frankly outdated concepts.  They are being imposed, like a dogma, an annoying operating system and other products.  Microsoft is not trying to create conceptually new products.  She never knew how to do them.  Previously, she just stole them, but now it‚Äôs impossible to steal. <br><br>  Any doctor will tell you - viruses so successfully attack only the diseased body.  Windows is the leader in this.  Microsoft gets additional excess profits on the caliper because it does not solve this problem in the bud.  She created a market for antivirus software that is virtually as meaningless as the viruses themselves.  Evil it is evil - struggling with itself.  Think about why you buy antiviruses and do you need them personally? <br><br>  <b>Adobe.</b>  The same "gray-haired" monopolist, like Microsoft, besides, he also imposes the PDF format, which was developed back in 1995, to everyone.  Everyone is told that he is VERY reliable, but try to open Cyrillic texts on Nokia smartphones ... What does Adobe offer today instead of PDF? <br>  Flash  Read the Steve Jobs article about the complete futility of this technology.  Attempts to manipulate their position as a monopolist to push through these technologies unequivocally say that dark forces prevail over the bright side. <br><br>  <b>1C.</b>  We are talking about products 1C-Enterprise.  This Russian company doesn‚Äôt seem to do anything bad, but we have to realize that certain inaction of companies that are massively spreading on the mass market of solutions for small business can do enormous harm to their customers who are taking their first steps in the business world. <br><br>  So, <b>reason number 1</b> . <br><br>  In other countries, not counting Russia, 1C works only through partners.  She works in the market for beginners and small businesses.  This led to the fact that if one of the clients says: ‚ÄúI have 1C‚Äù, then by and large it means absolutely nothing.  After all, 1C is a constructor, a semi-finished product, plasticine, from which any student can make a ‚Äúany solution‚Äù, good or not.  1C mislead consumers, in fact it violates one of the main consumer protection rights - a brand must be associated with a certain level of quality.  1C does not control the quality of end products built by partners in other countries. <br><br>  <b>Reason number 2.</b> <br><br>  1C is such a rich company that it allowed itself to develop unnecessary components in its platform - it created the world's first programming language with the Russian command syntax and its own database with a special translator to widely used databases.  Then she created a lot of literature and imposed the necessity of compulsory mastering of these software tools through certification.  As a result, instead of concentrating on solving the client‚Äôs problems, the programmer concentrates on finding an easy solution using the ‚Äúdice‚Äù manipulation method in unfinished tools. <br><br>  1C works with small business.  She has no right to offer him (‚Äúchildren‚Äù) a poor product for a low price and, thus, to promote the development of the wrong skills.  A company that does not understand this is a dark forces company. <br><br>  So who is to blame for the fact that evil walks the world on such a scale? <br><br>  The answer is simple - the person is guilty.  His unwillingness to learn, his natural laziness and naive gullibility to all wealthy people and their proposals. <br><br>  Today I propose a simple medicine - to use the ‚Äúatomic‚Äù power of IT, its cheapness and accessibility in the process of self-education of people. <br><br>  Everyone should understand that access to good education is like access to fresh air.  People trying to extract profits from education are bad.  People teaching or spreading erroneous knowledge are bad.  People who create barriers to accessing the best training materials are bad. <br><br>  Our children today are open to everything new.  We are obliged to give all children of the earth the opportunity to receive, through distance learning technologies, the correct and best education in their native languages.  We must give them the opportunity to become people of a brighter future! <br><br>  If you think that you have sufficient knowledge of IT technologies, then read the enclosed article with an excerpt from the book ‚ÄúMission of Business‚Äù written by Konosuke Matsushita, one of the greatest entrepreneurs of the 20th century, whom many Japanese call the ‚ÄúGod of management‚Äù for his ability to combine the desire for profit and a humanistic attitude towards employees, the creator of Matsushita Electric, a company known in particular by the Panasonic brand, and honestly answer yourself the question ‚ÄúAre you sure that your flashlight (IT product) cannot burn longer?  brighter "? <br><br>  Pavel TUKHAR, CEO, una.md <br><br>  <i>‚ÄúEverything or nothing, or headlamp for the bike.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>... In March 1923, Matsushita Electric began producing bicycle headlamps powered by batteries. ... The headlights on batteries, which then only appeared on the market, were rather primitive, and the battery life was only two to three hours.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>I began to think about how to improve the headlights with batteries, and ... after six months, ... My wooden case headlamp worked for thirty to fifty hours - about ten times the average life of other headlights on the market.</i>  <i>Not surprisingly, I was confident in demand.</i>  <i>My product was much better than analogs and seemed to me to be the harbinger of a new era.</i>  <i>And most importantly, it could be sold at a lower price compared to the headlights on the candles.</i>  <i>It seemed to me that my product would be sold extremely well, and I decided to start large-scale production.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Shortly after I started selling a new product, a completely unexpected obstacle arose.</i>  <i>Our potential consumers were simply not ready for the spotlight, which had a long service life.</i>  <i>Convinced that no battery could work for more than two or three hours, they did not believe our stories.</i>  <i>Distributors and store owners reacted in a similar way.</i>  <i>When I tried to explain that our headlights were fundamentally different from headlights that worked for two to three hours, they often said with doubt: ‚ÄúI am afraid that this is not so.</i>  <i>Thank you very much.</i>  <i>Headlamps with batteries will not be sold.</i>  <i>So take the goods back. "</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>I was unsettled.</i>  <i>There was some terrible irony in the fact that my headlights, which are absolutely definitely better than any analogs, turned out to be unnecessary.</i>  <i>"How stupid they are all," I thought.</i>  <i>Reassured, I realized that I did not do enough so that buyers themselves could realize how good my headlights are.</i>  <i>Apparently, words alone were not enough.</i>  <i>People could change their point of view if they saw with their own eyes how unique my headlights are.</i>  <i>But I needed to act fast.</i>  <i>The factory produced products at a tremendous rate, and gradually it began to fill the entire warehouse.</i>  <i>I needed to attract the attention of a huge number of consumers, and I could not lose time.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>In the end, I developed a plan that I thought should work.</i>  <i>I hired a few people who went around with all my bike shops with my headlights.</i>  <i>We brought lights to the stores and left them on;</i>  <i>they burned as long as the batteries allowed.</i>  <i>After that, distributors and customers could not help but notice how durable our headlights are.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>We took a huge risk because our headlights were not sold, but were set free.</i>  <i>Since the stores had no obligation to purchase, there was no guarantee that I would get anything back from them.</i>  <i>For a small firm, such a massive distribution of free samples was a big gamble: if the headlights had not started to sell, this would be a complete failure of my product and me as a manager.</i>  <i>Most importantly, I would lose the money invested in the business, and that would be the end of my company.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>It was a serious challenge, and I took this step with some trepidation, but this was the only card I could play.</i>  <i>In addition, I was convinced of the competitive superiority of my product.</i>  <i>I needed to convince customers of the superiority of the product, and sales would start to grow.</i>  <i>I remembered the old saying, "If you do not try, you do not know."</i>  <i>If a person tries to avoid all risks, he will never be able to achieve much, but if he chooses to challenge himself at some important moment, despite the danger, a new road may open up before him.</i>  <i>I took the risk.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>This story had a happy ending.</i>  <i>My bid was played, and the stores, convinced that my headlights had passed the test of uninterrupted operation for thirty to forty hours, began to recommend them to their consumers.</i>  <i>Orders rained down on us.</i>  <i>Distributors also began to place production orders with us, and these lights became popular throughout the country.</i>  <i>This case confirmed the correctness of the saying ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt try, you don‚Äôt know.‚Äù</i>  <i>And now I remember her when I need to make a difficult decision "...</i> <i><br></i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/120701/">https://habr.com/ru/post/120701/</a></p>
