How to authorize foreigners online by law?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  When was the last time you connected to public Wi-Fi?  Suppose it was on a journey.  In order not to pay for international roaming, you turned off cellular data transfer and used free internet at the airport, in a cafe or in a hotel.  If you know how to use offline maps and are not obsessed with instagram, standard Wi-Fi Free should be enough for you. <br><br>  Moreover, the process of identification abroad is as simple as it‚Äôs possible that your phone number will be needed somewhere and you will connect to the Internet via SMS, but more often you will not need to enter anything, a maximum is to tick the authorization page. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/45a/1f7/db8/45a1f7db890e1d1e72d2f0f27d4fb9db.jpg" alt="image">

      In Russia, with free Internet is somewhat more complicated.  On the one hand, you can connect to Wi-Fi everywhere, and where it‚Äôs not enough, there is cheap mobile Internet, with excellent speed and coverage.  But what if you are an ‚Äúintourist‚Äù?  By law, since 2014, operators of public access to the Internet cannot identify foreigners or this creates a lot of inconvenience. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Some numbers.  WI-FI is real everywhere </h2><br>  According to the approximate data, there are more than 100,000 free Internet access points in Russia, not counting Wi-fi cafes, hotels and shops. <br><br>  In large cities, Internet access is everywhere: at airports, on the subway and on ground transportation, at bus stops, on the streets and in parks. <br>  In Moscow, thanks to the joint work of operators and urban structures in the face of the Department of Transport of Moscow and Mosgortrans, Wi-Fi routers are equipped with buses, trams, trolley buses, public transport stops, subway trains and the Moscow Central Ring (MTSK).  A total of more than 8 thousand vehicles and more than 200 public transport stops. <br><br>  In addition, <a href="https://www.vedomosti.ru/newspaper/articles/2017/10/11/737373-moskvu-wifi">in preparation for the 2018 World Cup</a> and in the framework of the ‚ÄúSmart City‚Äù concept, the city‚Äôs Wi-Fi network was created by the joint efforts of operators and DIT of Moscow, which is the core wireless infrastructure that provides residents and guests of the capital with free internet access on the streets, universities, hostels of educational institutions, in Moscow houses of culture, museums and parks.  Over 20,000 access points installed.  Each of them provides a signal in a radius of up to 50 meters, and switching between points does not require re-authorization. <br><br>  The network allows you to provide access to the Internet at the same time up to 55 thousand users, works in two frequencies (2.4 and 5 GHz) creates a sure reception at intersections with other Wi-Fi networks and various household devices operating at 2.4 GHz or in the case of mass events. <br><br>  Free Wi-Fi is most popular among tourists, but not all foreigners can use it.  According to the current legislation, authorization in the network is possible only with the identification of personal data. <br><br><h2>  What does the law say? </h2><br>  In July 2014, <a href="https://global-hotspot.ru/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/147910783082527.pdf">the Russian Government</a> issued <a href="https://global-hotspot.ru/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/147910783082527.pdf">Resolution No. 758 of July 31, 2014,</a> regulating Federal Law No. 97-FZ of May 5, 2014 ... Now, when providing one-time data transfer services in collective access points, the operator must ensure the identification of users and the equipment they use ‚ÄúBy establishing the last name, first name and patronymic (if any) of the user, supported by an identification document‚Äù. <br><br>  The decision caused a wave of questions from telecom operators and property owners with publicly available Wi-Fi.  In response, the RF Government Decree No. 801 of August 12, 2014 on the identification of Wi-Fi users was adopted, according to which, from now on, it is possible to certify an identity ‚Äúin a different way that ensures the reliable establishment of this information‚Äù: <br><br><ul><li>  using the "reliable establishment of a subscriber number assigned to the user in accordance with the contract for the provision of mobile radio telephone communication services concluded with the communication operator"; </li><li>  using the "state federal information system" (for example, state services). </li></ul><br>  You can buy a SIM-card in Russia (officially) and register on the State Services portal only by confirming your identity with a passport.  These methods are acceptable for a resident of Russia, but inconvenient for foreigners. <br><br><h2>  Pros and cons of the law, or how it actually works </h2><br>  Theoretically, a foreign citizen can try to pass authorization from his number.  The text of the resolution of August 12 does not specify that the phone number should be from a Russian operator.  A subscriber of a foreign mobile operator can send an SMS with a code that must be entered to access public Wi-Fi. <br><br>  However, since foreign cellular companies are not obliged to respond to requests from Russian law enforcement officers, identification cannot thus be carried out. <br>  In practice, this means that some operators continue to provide service, despite the lack of verification. <br><br>  On the website of state services, foreigners without SNILS cannot obtain a verified account, and therefore can not log in to the network.  It turns out that in order to access public Wi-Fi, a foreigner must present a passport or get a Russian phone number, which is not very convenient. <br><br>  Other methods of personal identification are needed, and the operators were given the freedom to make their own decisions. <br><br>  Authorization scheme <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/22b/ade/938/22bade938a542ac9f38473b0232537c5.gif" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  What options? </h2><br>  <b>On transport</b> <br><br>  Now connect to wi-fi is possible not only in buses and subways, but also on intercity and long-distance trains.  For example, in the trains ‚ÄúSapsan‚Äù and ‚ÄúLastochka‚Äù, including with the participation of Netbynet, a network is implemented on the whole route. <br><br>  Some long-distance trains of Russian Railways do not provide an authorization page by telephone number, passengers can connect to the network using the latest passport numbers and the seat number. <br><br>  <b>In hotels</b> <br><br>  Most often this is a voucher authorization option.  The method is similar to authorization by phone number (via SMS or by call) and fully complies with the requirements of the legislation regarding access to the public network. <br><br>  Upon presentation of a passport, a new voucher is created for each guest with a unique login and password.  Each voucher in the system is assigned a room number, passport number, telephone number, and the date of arrival and departure of the owner.  To get access to the Internet, you need to enter the login and password for the voucher on the login page. <br><br>  Authorization for vouchers is usually used by institutions with a large flow of visitors: hotels, hotels, motels, recreation centers.  This allows you to save on sending SMS messages.  For example, on the <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/wifire/blog/416273/">Vodohod cruise liners</a> due to the large number of foreign tourists this method of identification was implemented. <br><br>  The integration of the authorization portal with the hotel management system is also common.  Guest need to enter the number of his room and the last 4 digits of the identity document.  Each user is tied to a number, the data is automatically checked with data from the system, which not only stores guest data, but also allows guests without a call at the reception to order various services - food delivery, taxi, massage recording, etc. <br><br>  <b>At public events</b> <br><br>  For example, at the World Cup last year to identify foreign fans, the decision was to authorize using <a href="http://welcome2018.com/your-pass-to-the-world-of-football/">a fan passport or Fan ID</a> .  This is an identification card, which was received by each viewer who bought a ticket for the 2018 World Cup match.  The passport of the fan provided access to the stadium, as well as being an identity card. <br><br>  Fan ID made it possible for foreigners to repeatedly enter Russia without a visa or migration card.  With its help, foreign guests could use city buses free of charge on public transport routes to the stadiums, and intercity trains running between the host cities. <br><br>  It was enough to enter your Fan ID number on the login page, and a foreign tourist got access to the Internet on the train, bus, subway, at the stadium, without violating the law. <br><br><h2>  What's next? </h2><br>  Unfortunately, all these methods solve the problem only partially.  A foreign guest will be provided with Wi-Fi in the hotel, however, it will not be able to get on the Internet all the way.  For comfortable use of Wi-Fi, a faster and simpler version of authorization or changes in legislation applicable to this topic are required. <br><br>  What method would you suggest?  And what have we missed? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/455120/">https://habr.com/ru/post/455120/</a></p>
