No question, you need to log into your personal account and see where your legs grow from. <br><br>  And again a stone in my way: the password does not fit.  I did not change it, to break - hardly anyone needs it.  Again, it does not matter, I used the password recovery, the activation code came, I again entered my old password - but I cannot log in.  It became an idea ... <br>  I look again at the password entry field - ‚Äúat least 8 characters‚Äù, I entered 31 (as with the first registration).  I decided that I need to enter a shorter password (suddenly give up?).  Having used the password recovery form again, I successfully logged in to the system using a password of 16 characters in length.  Here, about everything became clear ... <br>  By trial and error, it was revealed that the portal now accepts passwords of ANY length, but they will work, unless the password is more than 27 characters (moreover, circumcision does not occur ... if you enter 31 characters and take the first 27 at login, the system does not accept you) ... <br>  It remains a mystery to me, why cut what used to work ?!  (after all, I set the password a year ago and repeatedly used it). <br><br>  Without hesitation, I again decided to use the big red button on the portal to send messages.  I even sent 2 (about spam from 32 letters and about the password), the message seemed to be gone, but again I did not receive any confirmation of this. <br><br>  I do not know why I am doing all this, but nevertheless, I decided to call the hotline on their phone.  After waiting for 15 minutes of the operator and listened several times about the convenience and navigation on the portal, the girl answered me.  I was refused to be connected directly with technical support specialists, so I had to ‚Äúpour out‚Äù everything directly to her - about passwords, about mail. <br>  The girl said to wait ... <br>  After another 2-4 minutes, I received a quite expected recommendation from her - write in those.  support ........ (drumming) ... through the big red button ... <br>  I did not forget to notify that I was not answered yet by my appeal of July last year, so what is the point for me to write more ?!  But I was assured that everything will be fine, and these errors are just a global update of the portal.  Thanking her for the help (?!), I hung up and remained still in slight bewilderment from what happened: I really need to be patient, I really need to believe that this update (which caused new bugs (features?)) Will fix everything, or I just initially did not like their system? <br><br>  It is sad, nonetheless, one thing: everyone makes mistakes, but when you report them, I would like to receive feedback, but, alas, apparently not in this life. <br><br>  PS By the way, it became clear where I now have 16 applications there: in the previous post I wrote that I pressed F5 to send a re-application form, which the portal did not want for me to accept.  Again, suddenly all these questionnaires were registered in the system ... the registration date, although it costs April 22, 2010, but up until July 2010 (and it was then I last visited the personal account) they were definitely not there </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/118156/">https://habr.com/ru/post/118156/</a></p>
