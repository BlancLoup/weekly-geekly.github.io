How much ice cream? <br>  - That's the price tag! </blockquote><br>  <b>In this situation, the buyer and the seller consider each other idiots.</b>  Nevertheless, the seller is wrong - his job is just to answer any questions and sell.  Otherwise, instead of it, they would put an automatic machine for issuing goods.  The buyer may be poorly seeing, may simply not notice the price tag, may get confused about what and where - but more often he just needs to double-check the information.  And he responded, in fact, rude.  The result is no deal. <br><br>  A lot of obviously strange questions have completely different meaning, which is voiced.  This applies to sales and everyday life.  Let's look at a couple more examples.  Let's start with rhetorical questions in the spirit of ‚ÄúIs this puzzle exactly going?  Are there all the details inside? ‚Äù <br><a name="habracut"></a>

      This question about ‚Äúeverything is good with him‚Äù may seem stupid - they say, yes, we brought bad goods here and we sell them.  But the transaction behind it is very simple - the buyer hesitates and wants to feel your confidence in the product.  Simply, he either does not know what to ask, or is it a duty exchange ‚ÄúSure?‚Äù - ‚ÄúYes‚Äù. <br><br>  In general, there are no stupid questions, seriously.  We have a simple rule inside: not sure - ask.  For the demand of money is not taken.  I do not understand - ask again.  No one will look askance.  Do not be ashamed not to understand something, ashamed to mow. <br><br>  Imagine that you accidentally asked such a question about a puzzle (well, for example, without thinking).  Surely you would like to get a detailed answer, and not sending in the ass.  The same category includes the question: ‚ÄúAre you open?‚Äù - this is a request for attention, or the fear of error.  I do not want to go to an already inactive store and find myself in a socially unacceptable situation. <br><br>  ‚ÄúDo you have motor oil?‚Äù After a minute of refreshment in the store, is also a question that socially acceptable leads out of an uncomfortable situation.  I thought, I went for the oil, but here something else.  The person feels that the seller will put pressure on him and wait for a typical model of the buyer‚Äôs behavior from him.  And to some extent afraid to admit that he was wrong.  Therefore clarifies to denote.  It is correctly translated like this: ‚ÄúThere used to be an auto parts store, I‚Äôve come by the habit of butter.  And it seems to be wrong.  I want you to know - I definitely will not buy anything here.  And for everyone - is there no oil at all? ‚Äù  A similar question: ‚ÄúDo you have all the board games?‚Äù Is a socially acceptable way to clarify something like: ‚ÄúThis is the first time I‚Äôve been in your store, my eyes are running up, and I‚Äôm a little shy.  Please tell us briefly what you have here and why, ok? ‚Äù <br><br>  <b>Now more difficult questions.</b>  "Is this tree exactly going to grow?" - our favorite spring when selling cans of trees.  Similar doctors are also asked about the results of the operation.  IMHO, you must respond with a realistic assessment.  For example, ‚Äúevery fiftieth really does not grow, such is life - it‚Äôs still a plant, there‚Äôs nothing to be absolutely impossible to promise.‚Äù  Whom will you believe more - to the surgeon who will say what the tooth gives, everything will be fine - or who will explain what risks of complications and with what probability are encountered in world practice, and what will he do to minimize them? <br><br>  A similar question when looking at Scrabble - "And how many letters are there?"  This is a competency request.  The buyer almost bought, but he feels some insecurity himself.  He needs to understand whether the seller was telling the truth, but he does not know how to ask for sure.  Therefore, if the seller confidently answers: <br>  - 129 pieces! <br>  ... then the buyer becomes happy and takes the game.  If the seller joins off or begins to read the composition - that's all, sailed, immediately hang up for the purchase. <br><br>  There are people who ask really weird questions.  A question that can confound almost any waiter is ‚ÄúWhat is your tastiest?‚Äù.  On it you can generally assess the class of the institution.  If the waiter asks if you like the pintail from the Secret Valley farm of the 2010 crop, and then he will recommend a single meat dish - he proved his competence and the class of the establishment.  If the answer: "We have everything delicious" - this is the failure of Stirlitz.  This answer does not make any sense, as well as "everything is not tasty here."  One of the correct transactional ways, even in a cheap eatery, is the signature dish: ‚ÄúI advise you to make this soup, it has just been cooked, and today it turned out to be just wonderful.‚Äù  Or: ‚ÄúHave you tried our Samarkand plov?  We are preparing it until 12:00, just like in Battle-winning and Brilliant! ‚Äù <br><br>  About many games we are often asked - "Is it like a monopoly?".  No, of course, it is not like Monopoly.  As Monopoly, we have only Monopoly.  But the buyer does not need this.  In fact, it asks for a list of differences.  He has a clear image of board games in his head, and so far he has imagined it as a party to Monopoly.  What will change?  It will be noisy, fun, it will be necessary not to buy real estate, but to build a railway - or something else?  That's what he wants to know.  This is the question: "How to play it?"  The main thing is to understand. <br><br>  ‚ÄúIs there anything within 300 rubles, but not a card?‚Äù - from the seller‚Äôs point of view, there can be nothing non-card for 300 rubles.  From the point of view of the buyer - he just identified his Wishlist.  The correct answer may be different - or explain that now there is only such and such, because either you really choose the game or explain that there is no such thing.  But there is just a card, and they can be interesting, and you can tell more.  Depends on a person.  It is necessary to respond to the transaction, not the wording. <br><br>  Well, my favorite - "Why so expensive?".  This is a question that in a large city instantly shows that an entrepreneur has come to you.  Because, as a rule, a person who is really expensive will not ask so.  It is important for him to preserve a certain status, look, ask questions, then refuse for another reason.  But the guys without complexes, accustomed to the fact that it is necessary to bargain with everyone, calmly ask.  They do not care about status, they are like Germans - there is money, but the process of their optimal use is a wild pleasure.  And in response to this question you need to show analogues cheaper, explain the difference.  If it is clear, the person will be convinced that the price is reasonable (that‚Äôs what was checked) and will buy it. <br><br>  In general, check the transaction and think about what exactly caused the person to ask a question.  For questions you can learn about any person much faster than the answers. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/326170/">https://habr.com/ru/post/326170/</a></p>
