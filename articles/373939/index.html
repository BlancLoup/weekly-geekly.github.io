Inspired by such examples, he also decided to start a blog in order to tell what students are doing in the laboratories of universities. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/ec/f6/59ecf6c3baa10005153913.jpeg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Here's a unit I got + a completely cluttered room</i> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Almost a year ago, I was given the task to restore the old scientific installation, with the words: ‚ÄúEverything has been done before you - you just need to shake off the dust‚Äù - of course, after the first cap was removed, it became obvious to me that this was not the case, so due to the diploma work and many other problems, I really began to work on it only in August, after entering the magistracy - that is,  At the moment I am a student physicist, 1 year master's.

      I began to restore it together with a graduate student, who then merged.  In principle, it can be understood, why waste time on engineering work?  We have to do scientific work, not cockroaches from the vacuum chamber to pull out! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/ec/f7/59ecf761d280d431414798.jpeg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Removed the vacuum flange ...</i> <br><br>  Half of the blocks did not work, the other half works at 50%, some equipment is simply absent on the collapsed transformer, it was proudly written 1951, I was waiting for me to see the inscription: ‚ÄúMade in the USSR.  Plant them.  Stalin ‚Äù, the vacuum chamber is filled with oil, almost all the gaskets have melted, perhaps I will not list any more - I will pay. <br><br>  For the uninitiated, this means things are very bad. <br><br><h2>  Duoplasmatron, ion guide, vacuum </h2><br>  I am assembling an installation for obtaining a mass-separated low-energy ion beam in an ultrahigh vacuum chamber (9x10 ^ -9 TORP or less).  Obtaining and using ion beams began in the middle of the 20th century ( <a href="https://www.booksite.ru/fulltext/1/001/008/114/616.htm">you can read here briefly</a> ), originally in the USSR they were planned to be used in a uranium project for the separation of isotopes, so the ILU-1 (Ion beam unit) was built in our country, but the method turned out to be ineffective. <br><br>  I saw this setup at the Kurchatov Institute, almost in its original configuration, and people still work on it.  Seeing her, I got the impression that in 1945 a tank was driven from the front, an accelerator was assembled from his armor - cubism, quadraticism, thick 4cm sheets on rivets, the scientific results on it in principle correspond to the mid 50s. <br><br>  Setting up the installation, I decided to start with the most important part - <s>to take a broom and remove garbage from the room of</s> Duoplasmatron Manfred von Ardenne. <br><br>  Von Ardenne is a legendary person: a nobleman, a real Aryan, a Standartenf√ºhrer SS for such achievements should have gone to Kstene, but he did not.  He helped the USSR create an atomic bomb, invented many high-tech devices, its inventions are used in all branches of science today, and I use its ion source, by the way, duoplasmatron is used at CERN to produce ions at a large hadron collider! <br><br>  I believe that everyone who reads a hub in physics should read a brief biography of Von Ardenne. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4UUbxCoxkKE" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/go/m5/3r/gom53rmsg2x-hodrg2oejyjmyyu.jpeg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Duoplasmatron, isolator and Einsel lens with pulling electrode</i> <br><br>  First of all it was necessary to check the plasma torch for the presence of cockroaches in it.  I did not find any cockroaches, but I found some kind of debris and metal corrosion, in principle, the state of the ion source was normal, removed: carbon, rust and debris.  For further assembly, I decided to refer to the original and somewhere in the damp basement of the faculty I found the book Ardenne, where he described the characteristics of ion sources. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/px/bu/6g/pxbu6gp7rdg_kthv70az7bttuvq.jpeg" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/w1/vk/5e/w1vk5enmcuip-v-jjjyt3mzfz3a.jpeg" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ah/fj/xy/ahfjxyiez49lohhfuwjbn9v4dxu.jpeg" alt="image"><br>  <i>There is no book in English: * (</i> <br><br>  Google translator helped me with German, the geometry was done correctly, so I just made new vacuum rubber pads and Teflon insulators. <br><br>  With his diet, the situation was not so simple, the plasmatron was notable for its complexity of nutrition.  I needed to think over the scheme and find money for high-voltage accessories, but the main problem is where to find a highly stable source at 15keV, which will set the beam energy to us. <br><br>  Although, there are no problems, everything is great, I found $ 10,000 and he is mine. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qw/dw/sk/qwdwskjijwkkq9tkpzlkrx943am.jpeg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Power supply, high voltage source - supplied separately</i> <br><br>  The ion source is energized relative to the earth and the ions of the working gas are pulled out through the hole in it, ions of the same sign are repelled from each other, as a result of which the beam is out of focus.  In order to focus the beam in this construction, Einsel electrostatic lenses are provided - 3 cylinders, the central one of which is at a potential of 0.8U from the beam energy or operating in 4U acceleration mode on the beam energy, these cylinders must also be observed Geometrical factor, unfortunately I did not find good literature in Russian about lenses - so I was prompted by a reference book that I used in it the geometry is specified in relative units H (tsilinda-diameter-gap). <br><br>  It all turned out to be relatively acceptable. <br><br>  The previous person - who tried to assemble the installation, apparently did not know the principle of operation of the diffusion pump and poured the wrong vacuum oil into it, which eventually settled in the ion duct, and the melted gaskets caused me to completely disassemble all the elements, later it was also discovered that the valve did not opened / closed completely, and vacuum connections under copper gaskets did not have standard parameters or with an error of several fractions of a millimeter. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/g3/sn/cn/g3sncngmpnwgym4o4audpttdcis.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/i7/be/88/i7be88hflsti4bmr6tlyuvf3oci.jpeg" alt="image"><br>  <i>This is not a vacuum grease.</i> <br><br>  It turned out later that this installation was an adapted copy of an accelerator from Denmark, machined at our plants, from our metal, the quality of the metal in the USSR left much to be desired, and the Soviet M6 bolts and nuts constantly broke during the original assembly of the late 70s.  As a bonus, I got new valves, connections for which had to be redone as a result of technical errors. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pj/nz/2a/pjnz2aunszautzxrjazyffjhwqa.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zf/_q/mw/zf_qmwfvxnwmd8ockn-wxvz98zu.jpeg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Completely disassembled the ion guide (Frosted flange after special electrochemical machining for high vacuum, metal without machining</i> <br><br>  The diffusion pump is a real problem, not only is it not made of stainless steel, and was all rusty, it also has extremely bad parameters: one and a half hours to start, and an hour to stop, a large gas emission.  It had to be cleaned in special chemistry.  High-quality diffusion oil will cost me 70,000 rubles for 0.5-1 liter. <br><br>  A new high-vacuum turbomolecular pump costs 3,050 euros and fornasos 500 euros for it, and I need 70,000 rubles or 6,600 euros. <br><br>  As for vacuum control, I was lucky - there was a project.  From the project, at my choice, they decided to buy two low-priced wide-range Chinese sensors wpc-400, worth 153,000 rubles (initially, I wanted to buy Russian-made, but they turned down the price too much. <br><br>  The biggest fear is that in Russia there is no stability, and what will I do if after 3 years when the sensor breaks, and the company that sold me no longer exists?).  Because of the peculiarity of the work of the diffusion pump (the pump until the moment of acceleration ‚Äî it must be isolated from the pumped-out volume), I need to find 3 more fords, but this is not a big problem. <br><br>  In addition, I was given a very decent amount of money that I could spend at will, with the money I first bought 205 meters of cables and magnetic starters.  Two new racks were pulled out of the basement - instead of the old ones, and I found 8 packed fans vn-1, 12 cabinets clogged with radio parts!  There is access to the turner and the ability to make parts on the CNC. <br><br>  I have come to terms with the fact that all the drawings, diagrams and questions in style are different than the multi-core cable differs from the single-core cable, the features of its installation are completely on me, in other words, I will be an engineer. <br><br>  On this occasion, by the way, I have an irritation about which I will write later. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rw/i4/a1/rwi4a1vum51_zay4kva6kfx5m4c.jpeg" alt="image"><br>  <i>We bought a new wardrobe, cleaned the room <s>(the epic battle with the trashman)</s> , put some knots in place</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f28/a92/4f3/f28a924f35f8b68b6948a1566f2e98b8.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i><s>New</s> 19 inch racks,</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rw/4q/tb/rw4qtbsme9hcuqp6chucsybk6be.jpeg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Every little thing for 15,000 rubles</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/373939/">https://habr.com/ru/post/373939/</a></p>
