  <section class="page js-page"><h1>"Movement against spammers" attacked Vovochka</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Sometimes a sufficiently short but soul-catching appeal to organize a whole movement.  In one of the closed communities of Runet, this is what happened;  as a result, the Movement against spammers was successfully organized and is conducting its first action. <br><br>  One of the "accomplices" of the closed community published a call to arrange a "Day of Orders" for a persistent transport office that sends spam through ICQ.  The call quickly found support, because  It was in ICQ because of the imperfection of the protocol and its paradoxical mass distribution in Russia that many people are concerned about the problem of spam. <br><br>  Sympathy for the author of the appeal resulted in a sharp increase in the number of orders for all contacts both of the transport company and the office dealing with ‚Äúaddress dispatches‚Äù.  All information about the "opponents" migrated into the hands of the "activists" who began to ask for the most prompt transfer of a bank safe (preferably at night), dynamite and a bit of TNT, a box from Mitinsky cemetery, an extremely shy elephant from India and many other quite ordinary goods .  Contacts with clients through ICQ for the transport company actually faded away: the number of orders from activists at the moment clearly exceeds all the others.  The same situation occurs when ordering by phone.  Thus, we can talk about the unprecedented effectiveness of spam: the company received a huge increase in the number of orders. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The dialogue of activists with the head of the spam office, Vladimir, turned out to be quite unconstructive.  In response to logical hints that he is engaged in ‚Äúbad things‚Äù, the head advised everyone to install an anti-spam program (‚Äú... since you cannot configure a spam filter, then you want to receive spam‚Äù).  Also, in an interview with one of the activists, he said that he had recently acquired a new Mazda 3 car, thus sharply standing out from the ranks of the office plankton.  In response to the spam offices, many orders for the shipment of goods also fell down;  however, all potential customers began to demand the carriage of goods exclusively on the Mazda 3. The arguments that the elephant does not fit into this car do not convince potential customers.

      In the course of working with potential customers, Vladimir now has to rely only on <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blog/i_am_clever/36838.html">exploiting ICQ vulnerabilities</a> , as well as reducing the activity of the Movement against spammers.  Unfortunately for him, at the moment, the activity is not reduced, and the presence of Vladimir‚Äôs phone number by the activists does not foreshadow bright prospects. <br><br>  The activists of the movement prepared a <a href="http://ru.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D_9ktyUMTWIE">special video clip</a> in which they tell about their love for Vladimir, the transport company, as well as all spammers.  On the <a href="http://antirobot.ru/">website of the movement</a> in a blog format, the logs of communication with "opponents" are already posted. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/21841/">https://habr.com/ru/post/21841/</a></p>
