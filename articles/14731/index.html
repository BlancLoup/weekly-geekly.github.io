  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Bloggers vs. Bloggers</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  When requesting information on the Internet using the keywords ‚ÄúWeb 2.0‚Äù, ‚ÄúPromotion‚Äù, ‚ÄúAdvertising‚Äù, you come across the fact that most of the results of this search query are somehow related to blogs - which is actually logical and not at all surprising. <br>  The blog structure is a key component of the Web two-nol Internet, and it is bloggers who are the people who fill the well-known term with real meaning. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/79e/70e/dd2/79e70edd22ccd2f1686c91e7b1c77f62.jpg" width="320" height="180" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  However, judging by the search results, an involuntary question arises, do we have any distortions in the development of the blogosphere?  The first bias is that today blogs are trying to be implemented everywhere - and where it is needed and where it is not needed at all.  ‚ÄúPersonal blog‚Äù, ‚ÄúCorporate blog‚Äù, ‚ÄúProfessional blog‚Äù, probably soon the union of proctologists will create a blog for themselves. <br>  Blogs are trying to squeeze into all areas.  This is precisely the first imbalance - the creation of corporate blogs, at the request and trend of PR departments.  People are literally forced to write to this very blog, arguing that the competitor‚Äôs company already has a blog, that it‚Äôs fashionable, that the blog just has to be, because ‚Äúit‚Äôs necessary.‚Äù  The usefulness of such a blog will strive for absolute zero, because it is interesting to write from under the stick still no one has succeeded, and those who write just to write is called ‚Äúgraphomania‚Äù. <br><br>  Further, the second example of skewing is the creation of blogs solely for the purpose of promotion, with the sole purpose of making your blog visited.  In the network you will find dozens of articles with tips on promoting your blog: "Write as much as possible, comment as much as possible, add as many people as your friends". <br>  In such cases, again, the person writes just to write, the person writes comments to other articles just for the sake of receiving comments on what he wrote, adds people as friends to add to his friends and his.  What a person writes about at the same time is absolutely unimportant, the main thing is PR-it yourself, and PR is among its own kind. <br>  As a result, we get a vicious circle, a kind of thing in itself.  The same people comment on each other's blog entries, chasing rating, reputation, number of comments, and others are almost always purely virtual bonuses.  Such an approach is counterproductive, instead of directing its efforts outside the blogosphere, to attract hundreds of thousands of people who are still ‚Äúsitting‚Äù on banal, outdated forums and chat rooms, on offline, on print media, finally, bloggers are cooking in their environment, fighting and competing with each other.

      Conclusions: <strong>There is no need to create new blogs and blog services just like that; instead, it is necessary to rationally look at what specific services and blogs are missing on the Internet.</strong> <br><br>  <strong>When creating your blog, you should not rely on its promotion due to the banal addition of hundreds of contacts and active commenting, instead you should concentrate on interesting content.</strong>  <strong>not copy and rephrase, but think and generate fresh thoughts and new ideas.</strong> <br><br>  <strong>And finally, bloggers should pay attention to attracting people who are not familiar with the blogosphere, from Web 2.0, no matter how trite it may sound, to promote Web 2.0 to the masses.</strong> <br><br>  This and other posts are also available on my blog: proper.com.ua/blog </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/14731/">https://habr.com/ru/post/14731/</a></p>
