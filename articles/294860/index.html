Yahoo Experience</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/a3b/25d/2f4/a3b25d2f42596e7cfa0cf2a30e5a43f7.jpg" alt="Mobile graph" height="375" width="500"><br><br>  Developers monetize their applications in a variety of ways.  We have already described the main ways to monetize a program (for example, gaming applications) in the Appodeal blog: you can use not only each of the methods separately, but also combine them to get the maximum result. <br><br>  However, it is impossible to abuse monetization, since an attempt to show as many banners as possible or sell the maximum amount of in-game goods may entail a user‚Äôs rejection of the program.  We wrote about it here.  What to do?  Now, not only individual developers, but also entire corporations are looking for the best ways to monetize applications.  Not so long ago, Vice-President of <a href="https://developer.yahoo.com/">Yahoo Publisher Services</a> Yannis Dosios shared his experience in this area. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Yahoo pays maximum attention to the use of native advertising in applications.

    <h3>  What is native advertising and how does it differ from the traditional one? </h3><br>  The Yahoo team believes that advertising should not interfere with the user to work with the application, therefore, advertising should be in the interests of the user and not annoy him.  That is why we began to use native advertising inside our applications. <br><br>  An example is the user experience with the application Yahoo Finance.  After each section is placed native advertising, which looks exactly like the rest of the content.  In this case, the user in all cases sees that this is exactly advertising, there is a clear indication of sponsorship. <br><br>  Interestingly, this technique almost does not annoy the user, and the income for the owner of the application from such advertising is higher than from other types of advertising materials.  As for the advertiser, he gets a much higher conversion rate, more customers than in the case of regular advertising.  So there is a benefit for advertisers, users, and application developers. <br><br><h3>  What trends are currently the most prominent in the mobile advertising market? </h3><br>  This is a rapidly changing market, but the main trends are still possible.  First of all it is: <br><br><ul><li>  Increasing the advertising budgets of companies, both large and small, in the field of mobile advertising.  Companies are seeing more and more users of mobile software. </li><li>  The growing needs of advertisers in obtaining a reliable statistics tool for their advertising campaigns. </li><li>  Increasing the importance of working with ‚Äúbig data‚Äù to determine patterns of user behavior and optimize advertising campaigns in accordance with the information received. </li><li>  The rapid growth in the number of formats native and video advertising. </li></ul><br><br>  Here we, <a href="http://appodeal.ru/">Appodeal</a> , express our thanks to Yannis for emphasizing the importance of the areas we are working on. <br><br><h3>  Native advertising is great for the end user, but what opportunities can it offer to the advertiser? </h3><br>  As mentioned above, in the case of using native advertising, we get three key benefits at once: good monetization for developers, excellent results for advertisers (increased conversion, improved user engagement, etc.), plus no irritation from users - in many In some cases, they even like this format.  About 80% of advertisers, according to our research, are going to invest in native advertising this year. <br><br>  A recent <a href="https://digitalcontentnext.org/blog/press/new-opa-study-reveals-native-advertising-best-practices-marketer-goals-and-metrics/">study by the Online Publisher's Association</a> shows that in many cases native advertising CTR is about 400% higher than regular banner advertising.  But there are fewer random clicks on native advertising, while the banner level of random clicks can reach 50%. <br><br><h3>  Back in February, Yahoo announced the acquisition of <a href="https://developer.yahoo.com/">Flurry</a> and the launch of native advertising.  How successful was the implementation of this plan? </h3><br><br>  Thanks to the receipt of new tools (in connection with the acquisition of Flurry), Yahoo has more opportunities to customize advertising.  For example, you can place advertising content almost anywhere on the screen of a mobile device.  In this case, the advertiser or developer can customize the formats on their own, for which it is convenient to use the API of the corresponding service. <br><br>  In addition, we received more reliable statistical tools that allow you to see a huge amount of information about the effectiveness of advertising, attitudes of users to it and so on. <br><br>  We remind you that all this is already ready with us in Russian.  Best of luck to Yahoo for their development.  If you are already interested in integrating more effective advertising into your application, contact us through the <a href="http://appodeal.ru/">site appodeal.ru</a> .  We have very good Russian-language support, so we‚Äôll tell you everything and, if necessary, maybe even adapt to you.  By the way, very soon the mediation of native advertising will appear in Appodeal.
