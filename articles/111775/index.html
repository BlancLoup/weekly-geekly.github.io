Why is this needed? </h4><br><h5>  1.1 Description of files from personal life. </h5><br>  All the time I come across the fact that we need some kind of cable or adapter, but we don‚Äôt have it or it is inadequately expensive.  The same problems periodically arise from friends and acquaintances. <br>  I will give a few examples. <br><br>  I needed 2.5 years ago a twisted Mini Jack cord - Mini XLR, because the straight line broke.  My friend with similar headphones had a straight wire that was torn twice - both times he called a few shops with the declared goods, and it turned out that most of these shops ‚Äúare unfortunately not in stock now, you can pre-order and we will call you back when meet the next new year after some time, ‚Äùbut there is definitely only at the other end of the city in a warehouse at an inflated price (compared to foreign stores).  Result: there is no corporate wire or its analogue.  AKG service centers are silent - they said bluntly that they are not engaged in a related product of this type.  I'm trying to understand the features of the connectors I need.  My crooked hands nervously master the soldering iron.  Thanks to a friend - I helped out by soldering normally for me.

      It was necessary to connect an external audio card with a macbook.  In the MacBook, the new Firewire 800. In the audio card, the old Firewire 400. The search for online stores and the top salary gave nothing.  The main majority of consultants did not even know about the existence of firewire 800, and offered a Firewire 400 6pin - 4pin connector. <br>  Search on an Internet gave something like this: <br>  http: // link to the online store / catalog / Lacie_FireWire_400800Ilink_Cables_Kit <br>  The price is terrible, was not available.  Rescued friend who was at this time abroad.  We ordered the cable for 10 bucks, everything is ok. <br><br>  Apple Camera Connection Kit <br>  Price difference: <br>  Abroad - $ 29, we have - 1500-1800r. <br>  Although if you read the specification of the connector, you can solder such a thing even at home with components available.  There are a lot of foreign resources that are only committed to selling their own adapters for Apple products. <br>  This is not an isolated case of difference in prices for peripherals for Apple. <br><br><h5>  1.2 Cable search process. </h5><br>  Imagine that you are a person who does not understand either electronics or the intricacies of interfaces and connector standards.  For example, a musician, or even a better beginner musician.  You want to connect a sound card to the amplifier.  Here you go to any site of a famous electronics store or specialized cable store.  What do you see there?  You are offered to choose a category - most likely the choice will fall on ‚ÄúAudio-Video‚Äù, ‚ÄúAcoustic‚Äù or something like that.  And then everything.  You are offered to choose a manufacturer from a list of 15 manufacturers, then type, length, etc. But how can this be done without knowing how to connect?  You still do not even suspect that there are generally several options for this analog connection and a pair of digital ones, depending on what connectors your amplifier is equipped with.  Does everyone immediately understand that the sound quality may change with the length of the wire?  Of course, you do not lose courage.  You will find out which option is yours - climb on the forums, ask friends, compare your ‚Äúentrances-exits‚Äù with those in the pictures, sometimes with varying success.  Trying to understand, and who produces it, what are the models.  And only then can you return to your favorite store again.  This is all not very convenient, to say the least.  In addition, searches do not always end in success (see above) for various reasons, and the process of reading lace specifications is not the most fascinating reading, agree. <br><br><h5>  1.3 Prices. </h5><br>  Prices are not always encouraging especially if you turn to a segment of ‚Äúunique‚Äù or rare products, like Apple's cables or for example, for example, a twisted cord ek 300, which in Russia is sometimes several times more expensive than in the USA. <br><br><h5>  1.4. Old </h5><br>  Finding the right adapters to connect something ‚Äúold‚Äù to something ‚Äúnew‚Äù is extremely difficult.  I remember a case when I tried to digitize a VHS tape at home.  Who can immediately call what I need for this wire?  Or which manufacturer makes them? <br>  And what if I have speakers from the old AIWA music center, which I want to connect to a laptop or add an audio system to them?  But really wanted, and without friends "with a soldering iron" and sitting hours on the thematic forums, nothing would have happened.  About my grandmother's radar and say no. <br><br><h4>  2. Current market position </h4><br>  Shops are made by specialists for professionals.  It's great, but what about the rest?  Prices and range do not satisfy more or less complex requests. <br><br><h4>  3. Solution. </h4><br>  It is necessary to create a clear service for ordinary people.  What is meant by this. <br><ol><li>  Convenient search.  Search is not so much by the brand / characteristics of the cable, but by the fact that this cable needs to be connected </li><li>  Information.  Articles, FAQ on switching and devices, help system (technical support) </li><li>  Ready solutions (packs, sets - I don‚Äôt know how to call better) for switching.  For example: a home theater kit. </li></ol><br><h4>  4. Summary </h4><br>  I have a practically working scheme for the purchase of any necessary switching.  I ran it on several orders for myself and my friends.  Recently, I began searching for an investor for a project; the creation of such a resource will obviously require funds.  There are several people who already help with technical and organizational work. <br><br>  While I asked to make familiar programmers stub for the site.  Through it, you can place any order - I work as a service myself (therefore, so far only Moscow is available).  The bottom line is that it is impossible and pointless to develop a website without a constant stream of orders, and it is not interesting to constantly do this only for a narrow circle of friends. <br><br>  Of the delivery methods, while self-pickup and a meeting in the subway are available =) I have yet decided not to contact the courier service, as there is no stable volume of orders. <br><br>  If you, like me, the creation of such a resource seemed interesting, I would love to listen to your advice, criticism and suggestions in the comments.  Want to assist in programming or design - write to me. <br><br>  If there is a desire / opportunity to solder something, I can also consider your suggestions. <br><br>  Link to the website: <a href="http://shnurovik.ru/">shnurovik.ru</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/111775/">https://habr.com/ru/post/111775/</a></p>
