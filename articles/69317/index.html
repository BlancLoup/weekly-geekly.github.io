  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Tax reporting through the Internet. How to pay taxes without windows?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><h4>  Paradox wording. </h4><br>  This short article is addressed to the problem of lack of solutions for tax reporting over the Internet.  Today the question is particularly relevant, due to the legalization of software in many commercial enterprises.  As you know, the most inexpensive way to legalize software is to install OpenSource, in particular GNU / Linux.  The main problems of launching products from 1C, Garant, Consultant have long been solved.  But still not solved the problem of the lack of ready-made solutions for the delivery of tax reports through the Internet, focused on Linux-systems.  And both from the state and from the developers of such software, no steps are taken to change the situation. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  The paradox of the 21st century.  Pay everyone much or close! </h4><br>  All readers associated with accounting or its maintenance in software, it is known that our government is implementing by leaps and bounds the system of delivering tax reports via the Internet.  And everything would be fine, but there are developments on the market of certified software ONLY for products (in particular, OS) of the well-known ‚Äúmonopolist‚Äù.  After several months of debriefing regarding such an injustice, I concluded that alternatives oriented to Linux platforms had not yet been invented.  And in the near future it is not even planned, although the same CryptoPRO SZI for Linux exist.  <a href="http://www.cryptopro.ru/cryptopro/forum2/default.aspx%3Fg%3Dposts%26t%3D923">That's what they write on the CryptoPRO forum</a> .  In short, the essence of the branch is as follows: CryptoPRO SZI under Linux can be started and made to work, but the reporting system is not, because  for a Linux platform, such a system simply does not exist.  <a href="http://www.cryptopro.ru/cryptopro/forum2/default.aspx%3Fg%3Dposts%26t%3D923">Here is a link to the forum Kontur-Extern</a> . <br><br><h4>  What they say in the FTS? </h4><br>  On the FTS website there is a list of conditions for a participant in the system of submitting tax and financial statements in electronic form via telecommunication channels.  One of the points reads as follows: ‚ÄúPurchase software that is compatible with software installed by the tax inspectorate, which is registered, and install it on a computer with Internet access.  The necessary software can be provided by the telecom operator within the framework of the agreement concluded with the taxpayer. "

      It turns out that the state is obliged to acquire "software that is compatible with the software installed in the tax inspectorate, which is registered," OBLIGES to buy Windows + certified GIS + certified reporting system?  If everything seems to be clear with the last two points, then the picture with the acquisition of software, which is necessary for the operation of another software (also not free), which is needed for reporting, is not at all clear. <br><br><h4>  Preliminary conclusions. </h4><br>  The conclusion can be formulated as questions to the FAS: Is it true that the legal (approved by GOST) procedure for submitting tax reports via the Internet will not be complete without buying and installing Windows + exactly CryptoPRO + namely Contour-Extern?  Is it correct that the end user is not given the right to choose an operating system for "legitimate" work? <br><br>  I am 99.9% sure that if the state.  structure (in particular the FTS), decide to switch to free software, the issue will be resolved instantly.  It turns out you have to wait for the next, and a very large cut of the dough, before justice prevails? <br><br><h4>  How to pay taxes without Windows? </h4><br>  As an idea, I am now considering the creation of a tax reporting system via the Internet based on Linux (in particular, Debian / Ubuntu).  The main question in which I would like to understand in the framework of this post, what sticks can be (or will be) inserted into the wheels, especially from the state. <br><br>  UPD: Transferred to "Linux for all" </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/69317/">https://habr.com/ru/post/69317/</a></p>
