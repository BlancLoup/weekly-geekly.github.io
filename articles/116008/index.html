  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Experience placing applications in the Windows Phone MarketPlace</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello habrazhiteli.  Today I will share with you the experience of penetrating MarketPlace for the new OS Windows Phone 7. Every day about a hundred applications get into it and <a href="http://www.3dnews.ru/news/v-magazine-wp7-marketplace-uzhe-bolee-10-tis-prilozheniy">its growth rate has</a> overtaken the AppStore and Android Market.  In the pockets of developers (and Microsoft) flow rivers of green crisp pieces of paper, and hundreds of new programmers are registered in the App Hub developers program.  The growing popularity of the WP7 platform pushed me to the idea, why not write your own applications for it? <a name="habracut"></a>  Therefore, I now have 4 applications in the market.  Consider one of them - BurstIt, in my opinion, its history is the most interesting. <br><br>  I will not dwell in detail on all the vicissitudes of the development of the application itself, especially the article is not about that.  However, the registration procedure for the Microsoft Developer Program may be helpful.  Let's write out the whole process in detail, in steps. <br><br><h5>  Become a Microsoft Phone Developer. </h5><br>  We go immediately to the registration page.  Here you can learn about the benefits of AppHub, about what opportunities we will have after registration.  If you do not change your mind, then click Join Now.

If not, then register a new one (this process is rather quick and easy).  If you have one, then just log in to it. <br>  Then we get to the treasured page of registering ourselves as a new member of the Microsoft developer community. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/dc3/fd4/91d/dc3fd491d28c703a622dc4cf0339503f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  We will choose our list from the list of countries, and now we need to decide on the type of account.  I registered as a student (Student), for them Microsoft has special conditions and privileges.  In this example, I registered as an ordinary developer (Individual).  Let us dwell on this in more detail. <br>  If you register as an Individual developer, you will pay a subscription fee of $ 99 per year.  If you are a student, choose Student, and you will not have to pay this fee.  However, you will still need to confirm that you are a full-time full-time student.  To do this, register in the DreamSpark program (we will not dwell on this in detail, since everything is described in detail on the website).  I note that the difference between student type and individual type is only in the monthly fee.  I don't know the specifics of registering a company.  We agree with the terms of use of the App Hub, and click Next. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2cc/3b4/0e1/2cc3b40e1be614aacaa1f0a501298d5f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  At this step, we are asked quite a lot of personal and even intimate information - from the name and surname to the address and telephone.  After filling in all the fields, click Next again. <br><br><img src="http://rghost.ru/4855223/image.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Select the icon you like, the displayed name, and almost complete your registration.  There is one most important point. <br>  If you are a happy credit card holder (with which Microsoft will rake in as much as $ 99) with greedy hands, then it‚Äôs easy to fill in the following fields.  Everything.  Registration is complete.  For students of this procedure is not.  Your registration will be sent to your email.  Formal registration is complete. <br><br><h5>  We prove our existence. </h5><br>  It would seem that all?  Not!  Now we need to prove that we are not a monkey. <br>  You will write a service geoTrust, which will check you for <s>lice</s> that you really are the person under which you registered.  To do this, in the return letter you will need to send them a passport or driver's license.  Honestly, I have been waiting for a letter from them for quite a long time - about 3 weeks;  on the forums someone got faster.  However, the answer about the passage of verification followed the next day.  And there was nowhere to hurry - at that time the application was still being written. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3b3/f41/80d/3b3f4180d566559c03e99897a18d1034.png" alt="image"><br><br><h5>  Hooray!  We are finally on the market. </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/100/761/077/1007610774952f917becde3ab5f16aa7.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Follow the link and we have a list of our applications.  You have it is empty, but still ahead. <br>  It's time to fill in your application, to do this, click submit new app, and fill in all the fields (I will not give detailed instructions for this, after all, we confirmed that it is not a monkey, which means we can handle it).  I‚Äôll dwell only on the last step.  On which I had epic fail.  You have passed four stages, before you the fifth.  To finally send your application for certification, you need to scroll down the page and click the button.  The author (that is, I) did not notice this, and as a result, like a fool for three weeks, I waited for a response from the testers. <br><br><h5>  Test application. </h5><br>  Here I will review my application BurstIt.  Separately, I want to praise support for very quick answers: I wrote to them in the afternoon ‚Äî I received an answer at night, that is, even when they have a day, they are polite and even understand stupid questions with understanding.  The application is tested for an average of 3 days.  The first time BurstIt was wrapped due to the fact that a picture with the windows logo was used as the background, this was a violation of the rule on the use of trademark logos without their agreement.  I quickly fixed it (just with the help of a stamp in Photoshop I removed this logo, since I really liked the picture) and sent it to them again.  After a couple of days I get another refusal, for the same reason.  I thought that it was necessary to completely change the background, and made it completely different.  Sending again.  And again, Fail, and again the same reason.  Then my brain refused to understand for what this time.  I am writing to support to find out the reason, I get a timely response that I use the windows logo, and as soon as I delete it, everything will be fine.  I did not argue and tried again to send the previous assembly.  Finally, the application was published for the 4th time, and it began to be sold (I will not mention the numbers, but they are rather modest, although I am still satisfied). <br>  Only one moment remained, which I still do not understand why I have a sales report for March 20 only for March 12.  Why reports are not updated for so long?  If anyone knows, post in the comments. <br><br>  That's all.  In fact, this procedure is quite easy, and all the more worth it.  Especially for students.  Good luck to all! <br><br>  UPD: If the application is paid - the attempts are not considered, if the application is free - yes, after all, the submail account is subtracted from 100. <br>  All updates for paid and free applications are unlimited.
