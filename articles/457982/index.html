  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Moving to work abroad: 6 services to help expatriates in the United States and Canada</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/457982/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fz/1c/yc/fz1cyc__ihi_n81md0cdc3i0mqe.jpeg"></a> <br><br>  Looking for a job abroad and moving is an extremely difficult event with a lot of subtle points and pitfalls.  The slightest help on the way to the goal will not be superfluous for a potential emigrant.  Therefore, I have compiled a list of several useful services - they will help when looking for a job, solving visa issues and communicating in new realities. <a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  <a href="https://www.myvisajobs.com/">MyVisaJobs</a> : Search for US Work Visa <a href="https://www.myvisajobs.com/">Sponsoring</a> Companies </h2><br>  One of the most obvious ways to move to the United States or Canada is to find an employer.  This is a very difficult process, about which many articles are written.  But at least a little easier it can be, if you at least start searching with the right companies.  Your task is to move, but it may be difficult for a company to bring an employee from abroad.  Small startups are unlikely to spend resources on this, it is much more efficient to look for employers who actively hire foreigners. <br><br>  MyVisaJobs is an excellent resource for finding such companies.  It contains statistics on the number of work visas in the US (H1B), issued to its employees by a number of companies. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ic/a6/38/ica6388f5wljpygn4fn5x8azx_g.png"><br><br>  The site maintains a constantly updated ranking of the 100 most active employers in terms of hiring foreigners.  On MyVisaJob, you can find out which companies most often issue an H1B visa to employees, how many of them come on such a visa, and what average salary such immigrants receive. <br><br>  <i>Note</i> : in addition to data for employees, there are statistics on universities and student visas on the site. <br><br><h2>  <a href="https://www.paysa.com/">Paysa</a> : salary analysis by industry and region </h2><br>  If MyVisaJob is more focused on collecting information about visas, then Paysa collects statistics on salaries.  The service mainly covers the area of ‚Äã‚Äãtechnology, so data is presented for IT-related professions.  Through this site, you can find out how much programmers pay in large companies, such as Amazon, Facebook or Uber, as well as compare the salaries of engineers in different states and cities. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/lg/zb/g5/lgzbg5xngjtpp39ioehq7nhv-8g.png"><br><br>  What is interesting - with the help of various search settings, you can filter the issue to find out, for example, which skills and technologies are the most profitable today. <br><br>  Like the previous resource, Paysa can be used from the point of view of education - there are average salaries of graduates from different universities.  So if you are going to first learn in America, to study this information is not superfluous from the point of view of a subsequent career. <br><br><h2>  <a href="https://smilebright.media/sb-relocate">SB Relocate</a> : search for information on specific visa issues </h2><br>  A work visa is not the most ideal immigration tool, especially when it comes to the United States.  The number of H1B visas issued each year is limited, they are several times less than the applications received from companies.  For example, for 2019, 65,000 H1B visas were allocated, and applications received about 200,000.  Who will receive a visa, and who will not, is determined during a special lottery.  It turns out that more than 130 thousand people found an employer who agreed to pay them a salary and become a sponsor for the move, but they would not be given a visa, because they simply had no luck in the lottery. <br><br>  However, there are other options for moving, but finding information about them yourself is not always easy.  The SB Relocate service solves this particular task - firstly, in its store you can buy ready-made documents with answers to questions on different types of visas ( <a href="https://smilebright.media/store/o1">O-1</a> , <a href="https://smilebright.media/store/-eb-1">EB-1</a> , which gives a green card), the process of their execution and even checklists for self-assessment of the chances of obtaining them, and secondly, you can order a data collection service for your specific situation.  After listing your questions within 24, you get answers with links to official government resources and licensed lawyers.  Important: the content on the site is presented including in Russian. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/0o/k0/ja/0ok0jakcsmt22qi8kcvhrxrqiwo.png"><br><br>  The main purpose of the service is to save on communication with lawyers, the project has a network of specialists who provide answers to questions and conduct reviews of published content.  Such outsourcing is many times cheaper than direct contact with a lawyer from the very beginning - in order to only assess your chances of obtaining a visa you will have to pay $ 200- $ 500 for consultations. <br><br>  Among other things, the site can be issued personal branding service, sharpened for visa tasks.  This is necessary for obtaining some work visas (for example, O-1) - the availability of interviews, professional publications in well-known international media will be a plus for a visa application. <br><br><h2>  <a href="http://www.globalskills.io/">Global Skills</a> : search for technical vacancies with the possibility of relocation to Canada </h2><br>  The site publishes vacancies of technical specialists from Canadian companies that sponsor the move.  The whole scheme works like this: the applicant fills out a questionnaire, which indicates the experience, the technologies that he would like to use in his work.  Then the resume gets to base to which the companies from Canada have access. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/oq/4k/pt/oq4kpt3m92stxdsxz13qsk-p730.png"><br><br>  If one of the employers is interested in a resume, the service will help to arrange an interview and, if successful, collect a package of documents for an expedited move within a couple of weeks.  At the same time, the documents for obtaining the right to work help to issue, including the spouses, and the children - the permission to study. <br><br><h2>  Offtop: two more useful services </h2><br>  In addition to services that directly solve specific problems in the process of emigration, there are two other resources that cover issues whose importance becomes clear with time. <br><br><h4>  <a href="http://linguix.com/">Linguix</a> : Improving Written English and Correcting Errors </h4><br>  If you are going to work in the USA or Canada, then you obviously have to be quite active in written communication.  And if during oral communication you can somehow explain yourself with gestures, then everything is much more difficult as a text.  The Linguix service - on the one hand, the so-called grammar checker - is different, including Grammarly and Ginger - which checks for errors on all sites where you can write text (there are extensions for <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/textlyai/ndgklmlnheedegipcohgcbjhhgddendc">Chrome</a> and <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/linguix/">Firefox</a> ). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ce/nk/-h/cenk-hakhii-6fwo3mwvm47r9ek.png"><br><br>  But its functionality is not limited to this.  In the web version, you can create documents and work with them in a special editor.  It contains a module to assess the readability and complexity of the text.  It helps when it is necessary to withstand a certain level of complexity - not to write too simply so that it does not look silly, but also not to be clever too. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/tu/bs/lt/tubsltj-gbrvowetnzim0n5oi0m.png"><br><br>  <i>An important point</i> : the web editor also has a secret mode for editing private documents.  It works as a secret chat in the messenger - after editing the text, it is deleted. <br><br><h2>  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/">LinkedIn</a> : Networking </h2><br>  In Russia, there is no such cult of networking, self-presentation and recommendations that is present in North America.  And LinkedIn's social network is blocked and not very popular.  In the meantime, for the USA, this is a very good way to search for quality jobs. <br><br>  The presence of a "pumped" network of contacts in this network can be a plus for employment.  If you communicate well with colleagues on LinkedIn, publish relevant professional content, then when a new job appears in their company, they can recommend you.  Often, large organizations (such as Microsoft, Dropbox, and the like) have internal portals where employees can send CVs of people who they think are suitable for open positions.  Such applications usually take precedence over just letters from people from the street, so extensive dating will help to get the interview faster. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/sy/py/k1/sypyk1sbr5dsqlhknmex6rvuwci.png"><br><br>  In order to ‚Äúgrow‚Äù the network of contacts in LinkedIn, you need to behave actively in it - add current and former colleagues, participate in discussions in profile groups, send invitations to other members of groups that you have managed to communicate with.  This is a real job, but with proper regularity this approach can be beneficial. <br><br><h2>  What else to read on the topic of moving </h2><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/451230/">Five mistakes that people make when preparing for work immigration to the United States</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/442818/">10 common mistakes in writing English and how to deal with them</a> </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/457982/">https://habr.com/ru/post/457982/</a></p>
