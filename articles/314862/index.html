  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to deal with low network performance Hyper-V</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><p>  Network performance can ‚Äúmake‚Äù your virtual environment or disrupt its operation.  With <nobr>Hyper-V</nobr> networking tools, you can maintain high network performance and ensure even distribution of resources.  Although not worth mentioning, virtual networks can have a serious impact on physical servers and, consequently, on your virtual environment.  Although virtualization has many advantages, its main disadvantage is that it introduces new virtual machines that consume valuable resources, such as bandwidth and occupy the input / output systems of a physical server, which leads to poor performance. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/362/01e/55a/36201e55a3f34f6ebdc480df240fb83f.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  This problem is exacerbated when several virtual servers compete for a single communication system, which leads to massive delays.  One solution to this problem is the logical distribution of network resources using tools such as virtual switches and virtual network cards. <br><br>  Designed to help users create and manage virtual environments, the <nobr>Hyper-V</nobr> hypervisor includes tools for troubleshooting and controlling resource allocation.  From <nobr>Hyper-V</nobr> Port Mirroring to <nobr>Hyper-V</nobr> logical networks, there are several ways to ensure that your virtual networks ‚Äî and in turn the virtual environment ‚Äî are at peak performance levels.  Below are 5 tips for reducing the problems with <nobr>Hyper-V</nobr> network performance.

    </p><h2>  <nobr>Hyper-V</nobr> Port Mirroring Simplifies Network Traffic </h2><br>  When it comes to working with virtual machines within the framework of a multi-level virtual network architecture, it is not only important but necessary to monitor the load carefully.  Port Mirroring, included in Windows Server 2012 <nobr>Hyper-V</nobr> , captures network traffic from virtual machines to Windows Server 2012 and transmits this information to virtual machines configured for monitoring.  Port Mirroring can monitor internal traffic from virtual machines connected to a virtual switchboard and external traffic from a physical server to a virtual machine.  In addition, Port Mirroring can also be used to capture tagged VLAN traffic, as well as blocking unwanted network traffic, eliminating poor network performance.  With <nobr>Hyper-V</nobr> Port Mirroring, administrators can easily optimize network performance while ensuring security and assessing possible network problems. <br><br><h2>  Virtual switches </h2><br>  As you know, a virtual network connection is established and managed in a <nobr>Hyper-V</nobr> environment using the <nobr>Hyper-V</nobr> Manager technology.  With <nobr>Hyper-V</nobr> Manager, administrators can configure and manage virtual switches that all host operating system messages pass through.  In a <nobr>Hyper-V</nobr> environment, there are three types of virtual switches, each of which performs several different tasks, from being able to connect to a physical network to working with network segments isolated from the <nobr>host server</nobr> .  When used effectively, these switches can improve the performance of a <nobr>Hyper-V</nobr> network, while constantly increasing security. <img src="http://habr.habrastorage.org/post_images/330/ed7/08a/330ed708a1aa493498f25de98a59cf09.gif"><br><br><h2>  Advanced Network Security with <nobr>Hyper-V</nobr> </h2><br>  With the release of Windows Server 2012, the new version of <nobr>Hyper-V has been released,</nobr> with several significant changes and a number of new features.  The new version includes advanced network functions, including Router Guard and Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) Guard, which can be accessed using <nobr>Hyper-V</nobr> Manager technology.  The first one prevents the virtual machine from running as a router, eliminating router messages and redirected messages.  This creates an additional level of security in case your computer's OS is at risk. <br><br>  The latter, DHCP Guard, has several potential uses.  DHCP Guard authorizes <nobr>DHCP servers</nobr> at the Active Directory level, preventing access to spurious DHCP servers.  It also imposes restrictions on authorized <nobr>DHCP servers</nobr> , limiting their capabilities.  As a result, both Router Guard and DHCP Guard strengthen the protection of virtual machines in a virtual network environment from illegal network services. <br><br><h2>  <nobr>Hyper-V</nobr> Logic Networks and Virtual Scaling </h2><br>  Despite its usefulness, <nobr>Hyper-V</nobr> Manager is not suitable for all network environments.  <nobr>Hyper-V</nobr> Manager can only function as a management tool at the server level, which makes it incompatible with larger environments.  In order to move virtual machines from one host to another using <nobr>Hyper-V</nobr> Manager, you need to make several identical virtual switches, which takes a lot of time.  Earlier <nobr>Hyper-V</nobr> virtual networks also face problems in multi-user environments.  If you intend to work with a large network environment, you will need to build a logical <nobr>Hyper-V</nobr> Manager network to scale connections. <br><br>  Logical networks eliminate local area networks by grouping virtual local area networks and subnets in order to assign them to groups of hosts.  Logical networks are defined and managed by Microsoft System Center Virtual Machine Manager.  In order to take full advantage of the logical network and prevent network performance from falling, you will also need to create a network of virtual machines and define logical switches to work in your logical network.  Once all the necessary parts for building and running the logical network are assembled, you can reuse these components later on when creating new managed networks. <br><br><h2>  Squeeze out of <nobr>Hyper-V</nobr> everything </h2><br>  When it comes to preventing conflicts on a physical server, avoiding the poor network performance of <nobr>Hyper-V</nobr> is just the beginning.  You want to make sure your virtual environments look decent at all levels.  This means performing performance tuning for Dynamic <nobr>Hyper-V</nobr> migration, removing background activity and setting up hardware acceleration tools to speed up GPU offload in addition to optimizing network performance. <p></p></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/314862/">https://habr.com/ru/post/314862/</a></p>
