      <br>
      It all started with the fact that I got married (then I was 19 years old, 3.5 years ago).  During the preparation for the wedding, I realized that in our city there is a clear lack of a local wedding site.  At that time, I was working as a site editor at a local television station (TK Volga).  Riveted some small saytik, some were quite popular, but could not effectively monetize. <br><br>  And so, as you probably already understood, I decided to make the first Nizhny Novgorod wedding site (as it turned out later, at about the same time, another 3 approximately the same projects were launched in Nizhny).  I thought - did.  Launched the forum, began to promote the resource.  Within a month or two, the first core was formed, many of which still communicate on the site. <br><br>  In such a "frivolous" state, the site lived for about a year.  During this time, the resource has evolved, has become quite active.  But not about any advertisers, I have not thought.  Somewhere in a year I went to work in an Internet company.  After working there for half a year I met a person who was interested in my project.  This man was the former director of one channel (again, in Nizhny Novgorod, but another;).  Met by chance.  He offered me to create a company and sell advertising on my project, and engage in other areas - the creation and promotion of websites, etc.  I was both a creative and implementer of ideas.  And he sold it all.  Each of us did our job well - I did a good product, and he sold it well.  I was a technical director and taxied all the technical, and he was the general director and taxied the sales department. <br><br>  The main mistake was the fact that I knew very little about a person and I was naive enough :) This let me down.  After half a year of working together, I had to leave this company.  Because  ceteris paribus (i.e., they put all the resources and time and knowledge in the same way) the profit was not evenly divided.  What I did not realize at the beginning of my work.  Realizing ... decided to create a new company.  After talking with the employees of the company, I realized that the majority of those people who work with me (with technical department and managers) will not remain in the team with my partner, but will immediately quit. <br><br>  I didn‚Äôt want the team I forged to break up with.  Therefore, I invited the whole team to go to my new company.  To which he received a positive response. <br><br>  I will omit the details of the "expense" itself.  I will say only the facts: <br><br>  <b>pros</b> <br>  The project that I created was left for me. <br>  I gained experience in creating and developing an Internet company. <br>  I got the command. <br><br>  <b>minuses</b> <br>  I received 3,500 rubles from the company :) Although only the value of all assets exceeded 150,000 rubles :) (the person rewrote all the property of another company). <br>  For two or three months, I got just a lot of stress.  ‚ÄúShowdown‚Äù continued even in the police, where they allegedly had a ‚Äúcomplaint‚Äù about me (which later did not turn out and it was just a divorce, but after a complaint to the prosecutor‚Äôs office, the entire Cop lawlessness against me ended, good people were found who suggested behave). <br><br>  About that 2-3 month stress, I can talk long and tedious.  But this is a topic for a separate topic :) <br><br>  So, at the time when I was leaving the first company at the same time, I was creating a new LLC.  Then I already chose a companion whom I had known for 7 years, the person had leadership experience (I paid great attention to the question of searching for a companion, and did it quite carefully, selecting various options).  In the end, I am very glad that I guessed with my choice and now I have a wonderful companion.  It is important. <br><br>  Ltd. opened, found a companion, dragged the team.  All is ready.  Next was a long work on the project.  Improvement, work on the loyalty of the audience, search for new customers, work with old ones (although it was difficult with the old ones, as the old companion constantly inserted sticks into the gates) and so on and so forth. <br><br>  Also, during the time of operation ( <a href="http://rsmile.ru/">my</a> new <a href="http://rsmile.ru/">company</a> has existed since mid-2007), 3 more new internet projects were opened (site about <a href="http://www.vkolce.ru/">Nizhny Novgorod</a> , <a href="http://www.med52.ru/">medical portal,</a> site about <a href="http://byt52.ru/">household services</a> ).  We created a decent number of sites for our clients, we hold various promotions (I wrote about the first one in this <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/ne_startap/56351/">habratopeke</a> , I will also write about the second action soon, in the next week we will have it). <br><br>  During this time, have become quite well-known and popular company in Nizhny Novgorod (known, first of all, for their own projects). <br><br>  And in spite of the crisis and some problematic issues (about this is also a separate <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/my_business/61165/">Habratopik</a> ), in general, our company is all positive and good :) <br><br>  <b>Added later:</b> <br><br>  Judging by the comments there is not enough specifics in my topic.  I add numbers to the topic :) <br><br>  <b>About investments</b> : <br>  In fact, to open an Internet company a large investment is not necessary.  Another thing you need to know is that every month you can pay people a salary.  And this part of my questions did not cause - managers sell advertising, websites - everything is fine. <br><br>  Initially spent about 10 thousand (rubles) for registration of LLC.  Another 40 thousand spent on 5 computers, tables and chairs.  For 2 months, they ‚Äúlegalized‚Äù Windows and other software :) And 15 thousand (at first) were spent on the office.  Thousand 7 on the installation of the number \ Internet.  Total for everything about everything spent at the beginning was about 70 thousand divided by two, it turns out 35 thousand per person.  And this is not such a wild amount :) <br><br>  Of course, the first two months worked in a small minus, and then worked for half a year to zero, but then slowly all expenses were covered.  If it were not for the crisis, everything would be great :) But even now everything is quite good. <br><br>  <b>Could you disclose other salary expenses, etc.?</b> <br>  Revealing :) <br>  Well :) Just remember that it was in the first months, now, after 2.5 years, everything is different. <br>  I + Companon (he is an accountant and another) = 0 rubles <br>  Programmer 1 = 12000 p. <br>  Programmer 2 = 9000 p. <br>  Designer = 12000 p. <br>  Manager 1 = 5000 p. + 15% <br>  Manager 2 = 5000 p. + 15% <br>  Later came the "coming" accountant = 5000 p. <br>  Total (without an accountant, because he appeared later): 43000 p.  (not counting% of managers). <br><br>  On average, a month our project brought at that time 50-70 tr. <br><br>  <b>Immodest question but more interesting specifics.</b>  <b>Net profit per month.</b>  <b>Costs.</b>  <b>Turnover.</b>  <b>Revenue structure</b>  <b>Dynamics.</b> <br>  I answer: <br><br>  In the first month of work net profit: -20.  Now in different ways from 30 to 100. But we still have a process of development of the company. <br>  The turnover is about 200-300. <br>  Of these: advertising - 65%, website creation - 25%, other (firm style, etc.) - 10%. <br><br>  Costs: sn (now about 150), office (now about 10), hosting (2000 rubles. Month), Internet \ phone (about 7000), every little thing (office, water, etc. about 1000-2000 in month). <br><br>  Short but succinct :) <br><br>  <b>About the critical moment of parting with a former companion.</b> <br>  After we dotted i, the fact that we diverged, I was once invited to the OBEP of the district where the office used to be.  Allegedly on some trifling matter.  Said time, said the office. <br><br>  Came in due time.  I went to the office.  There were about 3 OBEPovtsev.  Like come pass, sit down.  And it started.  One of these um ... people comes up to the door and locks the key (!!!) from the inside.  And it begins.  They say we actually lit up you, we invited you on a completely different matter, ‚Äúbaby‚Äù (with flaring, all things).  And they start to play good and bad cop.  One means all the time scares - they say the statement to you is from such and such, as well as from such and such company (and supposedly they show a statement from that company - as it turned out it was also a setup).  Yes, they say you sit for 3 years (I ask for what? ..).  Yes you are so-and-so.  Yes, if you do not cooperate with us, we have the right to plant you for two days.  You sit with friends on the camera, think. <br>  The other one, who is kind, think about whether you should rest, consider you study now, you cannot complete a higher education.  And something else with an understanding look and pretending to be ‚Äúprotecting‚Äù me in front of my friend.  In general, the meaning of all the words was - if you do not do it the way your former companion wants, then you pipets. <br><br>  Then after an hour and a half someone knocks on the door.  And let my former companion.  Then I do not want to paint in detail.  But the point is that they demanded that I give everything to my former companion, including my project.  Agreed that I will think.  (And what would you have done when special people washed their brains for 2.5 hours, threatening that you would be put in prison for 2 days with criminals?).  And this let me go. <br><br>  To say that I was in shock is to say nothing.  Fortunately there are people who also work in the bodies.  After this "meeting" I immediately went to them.  They told me that this is chaos.  They said that it is necessary to write a complaint to the prosecutor's office of the same district.  There is little confusion, but such things will not happen again.  Now I will explain why there is little confusion. <br><br>  Such statements if transferred to a higher authority, they go down.  Those.  if I submitted to the regional prosecutor's office, they would be forced to submit to the district one.  Therefore, filed immediately to the district.  And from the district prosecutor's office all this is transferred to the very local police.  Those.  in fact, this is considered by the same people to whom the complaint is written.  Here is a crazy system with us. <br><br>  But nevertheless, the head of this police apparently slapped those "guys" on the hat.  And there was no more news from them.  It turned out that there was no statement on me, and this made me wonder.  Approximately such a meaning was the official response from the local police, or rather its chief. <br><br>  It was probably one of the most pressing moments.  There was also work with old customers.  But it depended solely on managerial abilities.  Unfortunately, most of the clients were not left with us, but this was not a problem. <br><br>  <b>A couple of links</b> : <br>  At the request of workers :) I add 2 links.
