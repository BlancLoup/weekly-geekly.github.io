Do you have hundreds of outstanding tasks collecting dust on a shelf, or do you decide one by one?  Do you feel generally satisfied with the achievement of your desires (and no matter what, working or personal)? <br><br>  If any of the questions you answered negatively - this article is for you.  In it, I will share experiences on how to do more and better! <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Introduction </h4><br>  If someone told me that he would teach me how to live.  first of all I would ask him: ‚ÄúWhy should I listen to you?‚Äù.  I will save your time for such questions and answer why I believe that my experience deserves attention: <br><ul><li>  I have my own quite successful business, within the framework of which I conduct trainings, provide consulting and outsourcing services, develop web products. </li><li>  Personally, I simultaneously conduct up to 15 projects in different directions. </li><li>  For those who want a catch: my clients are happy with the result! </li><li>  For those who want a dirty trick: I have 2-3 months of vacation a year.  With a laptop, but 2-3 months, in which I travel, ride a kite or wake, and catch other pleasures of life </li><li>  Oh, I almost forgot: I almost never dynamite sports, I work with teachers of chess, languages, swimming, and probably something else. </li></ul><br><br>  In general, I really hope that all of the above was perceived not as boasting, but as a valid argument, why it makes sense to listen to what was written below.  So let's go.

    <h4>  Skills, techniques, rules ... </h4><br>  On time management there are a lot of books and trainings.  I would say a lot.  I went to many trainings, read many books, began to use it all, and when something did not work, I was upset: ‚ÄúI am doing something wrong.‚Äù  And then she stopped being upset.  Each has its own religion, its own characteristics, and taking them into account is much more important than following some rules, even if they come from clever uncles with aunts. <br>  Only by exploring oneself can one understand exactly how to ‚Äúuse oneself correctly‚Äù  And I consider 2 conditions to be the criterion of correctness: the result is achieved, and the process itself is a high!  If one of the conditions is not met, then something must be changed! <br><br><h4>  Learning to value your time </h4><br>  Sometimes it seems to me that many people simply do not understand how limited their time is.  They earn money from their heads, don‚Äôt spend enough time on their families, spend a lot of time on routine trivia ... I‚Äôm very afraid to understand that ‚Äúlife has passed‚Äù.  What can I remember?  What will I achieve? <br><br>  To solve this problem for myself, I did the following: <br><ol><li>  I honestly admitted to myself that I could hardly live long.  We little people, in general, live a little!  Never forget about it, time says tick-tick ... Becoming a long-liver is a good idea, but 100 years is also not very much! </li><li>  I wrote a list of 100 life goals, thanks for the advice of the book " <a href="http://www.mann-ivanov-ferber.ru/books/mif/thepoweroffocus/">Whole Life</a> ".  If suddenly my hands fall and I don‚Äôt want to do anything, I open this list and have plenty of energy right away!  And my friends for the last DR made me an album with photos for each goal, and he also became my source of energy! </li><li>  I wrote down all my activities, which takes time.  I made a sign with notes: how much I like it, how well I do it, and how much time I spend.  For all tasks, where ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt really like it‚Äù and ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt really work‚Äù, I began to invent a strategy: where to put these tasks.  It was purposeful work on delegation, which ended with new people in the team, an accountant at an outsource, and a housekeeper.  It didn‚Äôt take a lot of money for all this, but now I have almost no idle tasks, as a result, there is much more energy, and I do exactly what I can do well! </li></ol><br><br><h4>  Procrastination </h4><br>  There is such a fashionable word - ‚Äúprocrastination‚Äù.  This is when you suffer from garbage, just to not take up work in general or some kind of task in particular.  There are many articles about how to deal with it, but I have one solution - surrender to procrastination! <br>  As soon as I begin to sausage and "does not work," I stop working.  This may take a couple of hours, or maybe a couple of days.  The main rule - ‚Äúwalking laziness‚Äù in full.  Yes, then there will be fakapy, you will have to solve the problems that have fallen down, the deadline will be added, and the energy generated in the rest will help.  The main thing - do not make yourself work.  NEVER. <br><br><h4>  Do what you like </h4><br>  This is true of Cap, but nonetheless: when you do what you don‚Äôt like, you lose energy, you don‚Äôt get results, overall productivity decreases.  But how can you not do what you need? <br><br>  I see 2 solutions: <br><ul><li>  Delegate - this has already been discussed above. </li><li>  Make it like that </li></ul><br>  I learn Spanish from songs, because I like it the most. <br><br>  For a long time I was looking for a suitable sport, languishing from boredom in the gym, in the end I found what I like (pool-pilates-wakeboard-trampoline).  I studied for a long time, I tried to force myself into unloved sections for the ‚Äúresult‚Äù, and it was not without pleasure that the process didn‚Äôt work! <br><br>  But what about absolutely tedious and uninteresting tasks, such as preparing documents?  I can't stand it, so I never do it at home.  I drive with a laptop to my favorite cafe, I drink my favorite coffee with my favorite cocktail of fresh juices.  Half an hour of an unloved task a week flies with pleasure! <br><br>  But these are nondelegable exceptions. <br><br><h4>  Places of power </h4><br>  I have already told you about my magic coffee shop, in which, by the way, now I am writing this article.  Such places are a storehouse of energy!  It is important to find them first, and then not to spoil them: <br><ul><li>  If I have a place for productive work, then it serves as an anchor.  If I chat in it, play, watch big picchu, then the magic will disappear.  Here is the Place of Power, and it cannot be defiled!  Find a place for yourself, and contact it to solve complex problems. </li><li>  Do not make the place of power daily bytovuhu, magic does not always work.  2 mega-productive hours a day is great!  Attempting to work at a maximum of 40 hours a week will not lead to anything. </li></ul><br><br><h4>  Effective planning </h4><br>  Many know how to plan in the meaning of "create a plan."  But planning is a daily activity.  Keep track of statuses, do not forget the main thing, take into account priorities, react to changes ... How to do it if there are a lot of tasks? <br><br>  I conduct all the tasks in Redmine, but this is not enough for me, I need a more visual tool.  And I have them: this is the mind map on the wall. <br><br>  I take a sheet of drawing paper, and with felt-tip pens I draw a mind map.  It has all the projects, for large projects there are big tasks-subprojects.  Inside these projects, I stick stickers with specific tasks.  When the task is ready - I outweigh it in the ‚ÄúMade!‚Äù Branch, next to which a salute is drawn, full of joy and happiness.  Every week, completed tasks are moved to a transparent file so that I can see how many there are, which file is plump.  Volumes of completed tasks are very motivating! <br><br>  What does it give me: <br><ul><li>  Motivation.  With such joy, I re-stick the leaflets into ‚Äúdone!‚Äù, And I am so proud of myself when I completed many tasks in a week that in the end the following tasks are solved with great positive! </li><li>  Visibility.  In general, I like to present everything via mind cards, I can see from them what project, where what is needed, where is priest, where everything is fine. </li><li>  Convenience control.  I also sculpt my tasks with stickers of a different color, and I know that they need to be monitored. </li></ul><br><br><h4>  He lives against wool </h4><br>  When during working hours you are twitched all the time, a lot of time is spent on useless communication, distraction, understanding.  It is difficult to switch between tasks, efficiency drops. <br><br>  Very lucky for those who can afford to work in a shifted schedule.  I have a standard schedule, either from 6 to 14, or from 16 to midnight (or less).  First of all, it allows me to take into account my biorhythms, and they change all the time with me.  Secondly, thanks to this, I can also solve tasks related to other people (when I need to interact with someone), and in another part of time I can sit up and solve my tasks painstakingly so that nobody twitches me. <br><br>  In one company, I even managed to convince the manager to transfer the lead analyst, the busiest person, to a non-standard week: he started working on Saturdays instead of Mondays.  As a result, its results sharply soared, because  no distractions on his saturday! <br><br><h4>  Do not postpone for tomorrow what can be postponed to the day after tomorrow </h4><br>  Many believe that it is good to do everything in advance.  Anyone but me <br><br>  Here are some illustrations from life: <br><ul><li>  <i>Getting started at 14 with something.</i>  <i>In the mail for 9:30 a letter: "Natasha, trouble!</i>  <i>Fire!</i>  <i>We were sued!</i>  <i>Such problems. ‚Äù</i>  <i>I go further, at 13:45: "I phoned, I found out everything, I learned from a lawyer, everything is decided, this is what we need to do."</i>  And if I immediately took up the decision? </li><li> <i>We decided to make a report with a colleague to the conference.</i>  <i>I made a superficial description, it is very detailed.</i>  <i>A month later they wrote to him: ‚Äúunfortunately, such a topic already exists.‚Äù</i>  <i>They wrote to me: ‚Äúthe topic has been adopted, but taking into account similar topics, please focus on this and this.‚Äù</i>  In the end, reworked EVERYTHING, but I did nothing :) </li></ul><br>  At some point, something will happen and affect the results of your work.  It always happens!  Do everything at the last moment - and the risk of redoing something will be much lower! <br><br><h4>  Fixing tasks </h4><br>  Uncommitted tasks are the very opposite energy absorber.  10 times a day to remember "I need to remember to do this here" - brrrr! <br><br>  ALL OBJECTIVES <br><br>  MUST BE FIXED <br><br>  IN ONE PLACE <br><br>  and let it be a task tracker, notebook or guglotablichka - it does not matter! <br><br><h4>  Jump?  Above the head, of course! </h4><br>  The worst sin is to underestimate yourself.  Plan a little, postpone, fear. <br><br>  I have long wanted to pass the ISTQB exam, but didn‚Äôt I start preparing?  Great, today I paid for the exam on July 13, now I‚Äôll have time to do it. <br><br>  I do not know how to do something?  First you have to promise / get involved, and then watch! <br><br>  I have never had any experience so that I (or someone else) could NOT be able to do something due to lack of time.  Because of the reluctance - yes.  Because he has been postponing for years - yes.  But if you already subscribe ... In general, try, enter in 5 adventures at once, and make sure that everything will work out for you. <br><br><h4>  findings </h4><br>  Each has its own religion, and it is likely that for someone my advice will not be applicable.  But before you decide - try it!  Create a mega-list of goals.  select unloved activities, think up how to delegate, find a place for yourself, try to do 5 times more than you did before ... <br><br>  If there is a desire, then everything will work out! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/184684/">https://habr.com/ru/post/184684/</a></p>
