      Changing the very form of threats.  On the one hand, threats of the ‚Äúreal‚Äù world disappear in a virtual environment (for example, cable breaks, failure of a specific server board, etc.), but others arise (for example, incorrect software configuration of logical connections between objects of the virtual environment, the possibility of theft / destruction of virtual environments entirely due to the fact that virtual machines are files that can be copied to removable media or deleted). <br><br>  In addition, there is the question of how to ‚Äústretch‚Äù the requirements of regulatory bodies (FSTEC) on the virtual environment, since the existing requirements describe the requirements for protection, assuming that cables, servers and network equipment are physical objects. <br><br>  <b>We structure security threats in a virtual environment in accordance with its architectural levels:</b> <br><ul><li>  The hardware platform on which the virtual environment is deployed; </li><li>  System software virtualization (hypervisor), performing the functions of managing hardware resources and resources of virtual machines; </li><li>  Virtual environment management system (server and client software components that allow you to control the settings of the hypervisor and virtual machines locally or remotely); </li><li>  Virtual machines that include system and application software; </li><li>  Storage area network (including switching equipment and storage system) with hosted virtual machine images and data (storage network can be implemented based on SAN, NAS, iSCSI). </li></ul><br><br>  <b>When analyzing threats, it is important to take into account the specifics of processing personal data in a virtual environment:</b> <br><ul><li>  They are processed within the virtual machines.  Within a single server, there can be many virtual servers, on each of which personal data of different categories can be processed, and the servers themselves can be included in different personal data information systems.  In this case, the "image" of the server can be located in a separate data storage. </li><li>  Transferred between virtual machines within a virtual environment.  Since a virtual machine is a file stored in the data storage, the transfer of personal data between virtual machines assumes that PDs come out of one data storage area, pass network switches, go to a server with a virtual environment deployed, and then return to the storage in reverse order. but for another virtual machine. </li><li>  Transmitted between the virtual environment and the external environment (both real and virtual).  The peculiarity is that data related to different virtual servers or information systems can ‚Äúcome out‚Äù of the network interface of a single physical server and, accordingly, the question arises of integrating protection mechanisms of the virtual environment and external physical components. </li></ul><br><br>  <b>Consider the threats of each level caused by intentional or unintentional actions of potential violators.</b> <br><br><h2>  Threats to the hardware platform (common server platforms, blade baskets) </h2><br><br>  <strong>Violation of the hardware components of server hardware with installed components of the virtual environment</strong> <br>  <sub><b>Potential intruder:</b></sub> <br>  1) An employee who does not have access rights to premises with hosted virtual environment components; <br>  2) Visitor; <br>  3) Administrator. <br>  <sub><b>What's happening:</b></sub> <br>  1) Physical damage to the hardware components of the virtual environment; <br>  2) Unauthorized removal or replacement of equipment components; <br>  3) Unauthorized violation of the hardware components or adjacent supporting systems (power off, air conditioning systems, etc.); <br>  4) Failures and failures in the operation of adjacent support systems (power supply, air conditioning, etc.). <br>  <sub><b>Effects:</b></sub> <br>  1) Violation of the availability of PD.

<br>  2) Placing information of different levels of confidentiality within individual storage networks. <br>  <sub><b>Organizational measures:</b></sub> <br>  Regulate the procedures for creating and administering the storage area network. <br><br><h4>  Notes: </h4>  <sub>[1] This implies that the storage network is based on a SAN.</sub> <sub><br></sub>  <sub>[2] At the moment there are no precedents for certification in the FSTEC of the storage network component that implements protection functions.</sub> <br><br>  We use this table when developing specific threat models for personal data information systems deployed in a virtual environment and organizing protection measures.  It is necessary to at least go over the checklist and check all the points: a ‚Äúleak‚Äù even in one of them can mean a serious threat to the security of the system as a whole. <br><br>  PS I see a lot of bookmarks added, but still I would like to understand how relevant such data is here and whether it is worth, for example, to consider the specific scenarios of each of the threats in future articles.  Give feedback, please. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/140044/">https://habr.com/ru/post/140044/</a></p>
