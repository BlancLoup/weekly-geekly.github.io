  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What to read on Swift in Russian?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Among the newcomers there is a perception that the popularity of a programming language can be determined by the number of books issued.  As an example, you can mention Java or Python - and in part this will be true.  But there are languages ‚Äã‚Äãthat do not really need paper books.  Just because of his youth and the fact that the official tutorial answers absolutely all the questions of a novice programmer. <br><br><img width="1060" height="600" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/99c/b64/29b/99cb6429b707a1f191d488fb40959d75.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Here Swift is just such a language.  He is young and popular, and the official electronic documentation on him is simply superb.  And maybe someone who is not even 20 now is happy with the lack of Swift books on store shelves, but older people just love to always have a paper guide and a short language guide in their vacation suitcase at hand.

      Therefore, the author of the blog <a href="https://vk.cc/8j5uIc">GeekBrains,</a> Ilya Bubnov, has studied Russian publishing houses along and across in order to find the 5 most popular books on Swift, released in the old school format. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Swift.  Basics of developing applications for iOS and macOS </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/409/4fc/691/4094fc69113537eaacc4f1d324c4679b.jpg" height="400"><br><br>  We open our review, perhaps, from the best book for beginners that can be found in Russian.  The fact that this is the creation of the Russian developer, and not the joint work of the translator and the author, is felt from the first pages.  You will step by step familiarize yourself with the Swift language and, more importantly, learn how to create applications for Apple operating systems with it. <br><br>  In fact, the only drawback is the fact that the book helps to take only the first steps in Swift programming.  In addition, using it as a basic reference is not very convenient. <br><br>  <b>Reviews</b>  Almost all reviews are enthusiastic, which is not surprising, given the volume and price.  Plus there is a new edition, which tells about the work on Swift 3.0, due to the limited choice it is also a great advantage. <br><br><h3>  Swift language.  Tutorial </h3><br><img height="400" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fef/f5e/e75/feff5ee756355904b101ced92e73dd73.jpg"><br><br>  Classic reference based on the second version of the Swift language.  The first half of the book is devoted to the description of types, functions, operators, cycles - briefly talks about everything, including the principles of OOP.  In the second part, the components of ‚Äúadult‚Äù programming are described in detail: classes, structures, protocols, optional types, etc. <br><br>  The word "Tutorial" in the title should not mislead you - there are no practical tasks, unlike the previous book, and very few examples.  That is, if you have difficulties with training in technical literature, this book is definitely not for you.  But if you want to have on hand a small reference book with basic explanations, this is a good choice. <br><br>  <b>Reviews</b>  In general, the book has more positive responses, almost no sharply negative ones.  The advantages of readers include a pleasant style of presentation and informative.  Among the shortcomings is the lack of practical tasks and the fact that in 2018 it would be time to release a reissue for Swift 3.0, since many of the techniques described are outdated in the new version of the language. <br><br><h3>  <a href="https://www.ozon.ru/context/detail/id/140304577/">Swift 3. Development of applications in the Xcode environment for the iPhone and iPad using the iOS SDK</a> </h3><br><img height="400" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9ac/73e/11f/9ac73e11f774011531ec7fed0d347d4c.jpg"><br><br>  Literally the most valuable book of our rating, to buy it today is cheaper than 3000 rubles is extremely difficult.  On the other hand, experienced programmers know for sure: a good book is expensive.  Impressive volume (under 900 pages), beautiful appearance, wide range of topics covered, high-quality theory and practice.  Such a book will rejoice even a professional iOS developer, and for a beginner, it can become a bible at all. <br><br>  As it often happens, the translation has several rough edges, but for such a volume their number is insignificant.  In addition, the basic part here is given a little crumpled, that is, the reader is required to be familiar with at least one programming language.  Better if it is Objective-C. <br><br>  <b>Reviews</b>  In runet all reviews are enthusiastic, if you do not raise the issue price.  But opinions on Amazon are divided: someone is fascinated by the proposed training through practice, and someone scolds the frequent omissions of the text, typos and general blots, which appeared only in the 3rd edition. <br><br><h3>  Swift for kids.  Tutorial on creating applications for iOS </h3><br><img height="400" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7f2/ebe/7f1/7f2ebe7f164ee3a2f61761aa2804e9f9.jpg"><br><br>  Such tutorials attract no less attention than books from the ‚Äú... For Dummies" series, plus they also have a bright cover.  This copy is no exception.  The main goal of the authors: to convey even to a small child how to create an application for the iPhone.  And they succeeded.  Hence a lot of primitive text and frank water.  But in general, if you need a non-boring book about the basics of Swift - this is an excellent choice.  The bonus comes with many illustrations and examples. <br><br>  Here, of course, there are enough promises that can make a morally fragile child nervous.  For example, the given XCode screenshots with explanations were made in version 8, while now the 10th is preparing for release.  Part of the code is sometimes omitted because of its ‚Äúobviousness‚Äù, although children, they say, do not like this.  And in general, the whole book is more a description of the process of creating a single application.  After reading it, you need to read at least one more, similar in content, but much older book. <br><br>  <b>Reviews</b>  It was not possible to find negative about the translation, content or presentation of information in Runet.  It is understandable, what quibbles, when the book has such a name?  But in the West, there are claims, mainly to the final parts of the self-help manual, which raise more questions than give answers.  But this is perhaps the classic claim to the ‚Äúchildren's‚Äù self-help books devoted to the full cycle of creating an application. <br><br><h3>  Swift.  Pocket guide.  Programming in iOS and OS X </h3><br><img height="400" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/582/8f6/831/5828f6831fdd830915ed9d86e7a4bcb1.jpg"><br><br>  O'Reilly's books have long earned the respect of programmers around the world: in this series you will not find "amateurish" creations, very rarely there are critical errors in the form of non-working code in the examples, or "wrong" screenshots.  This book is no exception, it fully meets the title of the directory. <br><br>  Despite the fact that the outdated version of Swift 2.1 is taken as a basis, a good syllable and the general structure of the text make it possible to use this book as a paper assistant along with the official electronic version. <br><br>  <b>Reviews</b>  Most of the ratings have a reserved positive color.  It was possible to find only one negative review, dedicated to the fact that the book covers only the basics of Swift.  However, this is only a matter of high expectations from the book called "Pocket Guide." <br><br><h3>  Total </h3><br>  The little that is translated into Russian by Swift, it is possible to take in the study.  There are no failures with either professional terms or the quality of the selected literature.  But still a little sad that the choice is limited.  So the logical question is: <br><br>  What book on Swift would you like to see translated into Russian? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/417711/">https://habr.com/ru/post/417711/</a></p>
