I'll tell you about the fashion that I really like :) and which I am very pleased to watch.  No, there is no titanium here, as there was no place for nanotechnologies.  All that happened was unpretentious 2.0 tweeters for 200 rubles, a pipe + a sheet of plexiglass and a mop;) <br><br><img src="http://img515.imageshack.us/img515/2984/dscn0122kk9.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  What came of it - look at the video! <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Yes, exactly the last article!  :) <br>  Mods are completely different and unthinkable - you can muzzle a toilet, an old tape recorder and so on - but this is another question - how it will look as a result.  It would be uncomfortable for me to sit next to some kind of pothole, inside which about a dozen neonok burned - many overdo it.

      I tried to make such a mod, single, so that it would not be a shame to leave it and show it.  Yes, and more.  In my understanding, modding is not only the purchase of a commercial unit with the subsequent assembly into the box, where only a screwdriver is required.  For me, modding is a hobby, a place to ‚Äúthink‚Äù, where original solutions and the ability to work with all available tools are required. <br><br>  In general, I decided to try my luck in another category of the competition - the AU.  My defenders had nothing to lose (by the way, they are not even on the product site anymore) - I decided to torment them. <br><br>  The first thing I bought was two plasma tubes - 30 cm long each.  They are tricolor - RGB, but on all the pics, because of the long exposure, the lamps seem purple and no lightning is visible on them;) These lightnings look terribly erotic and it seemed to me a good connection ‚Äúlightning music‚Äù - a kind of ‚Äúdancing‚Äù. <br><br><img src="http://img408.imageshack.us/img408/2535/dscn0068yh7.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Sawing off two more parts of <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/modding/41229/">the same</a> pipe to the height of the shelves of the computer desk, I toned them with black paint (so that everything was in the same style with bp). <br><br><img src="http://img408.imageshack.us/img408/4380/dscn0073uk8.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Then, special base rings were machined from plastic, which helped to securely reinforce these tubes on the shelves. <br><br><img src="http://img396.imageshack.us/img396/8442/dscn0074eu4.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Next, from the sheets of plexiglass, I cut out rectangular fragments, inside which circles under the tubes were cut out with a special self-made device (how could I not have enough dremels! :)). <br><br><img src="http://img136.imageshack.us/img136/3083/dscn0105qb9.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="http://img396.imageshack.us/img396/4982/dscn0110oc9.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="http://img396.imageshack.us/img396/5392/dscn0117wx6.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Further, these coasters were painted in silver color.  They were supposed to install speakers.  I acted with them in the following way: after disassembling the case and pulling out the speakers, I spent a couple of hours so that I could get symmetrical even and neat ‚Äúgrids‚Äù for the speakers. <br><br><img src="http://img401.imageshack.us/img401/4458/dscn0093al3.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="http://img396.imageshack.us/img396/8071/dscn0102fv9.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="http://img401.imageshack.us/img401/5048/dscn0096ug8.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  I also painted them black, after which I installed the speakers fraternly. <br><img src="http://img408.imageshack.us/img408/8395/dscn0103xr1.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Above, silver plexiglas plates were also installed (alternating black and silver). <br><br><img src="http://img233.imageshack.us/img233/6103/dscn0142ph0.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The whole structure needed additional support and I acted as follows :) I took a regular mop and sawed it into more or less wounded parts with a jigsaw.  From the mop tips I cut out rings that would provide additional structural strength.  All this was also painted, and then securely installed. <br><br><img src="http://img233.imageshack.us/img233/3008/dscn0133jw5.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="http://img233.imageshack.us/img233/5561/dscn0135dt1.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Two buttons to control the plasma were brought to the table in a homemade panel: <br><img src="http://img396.imageshack.us/img396/765/dscn0091rz8.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Plasma installation: <br><img src="http://img440.imageshack.us/img440/5050/dscn0147gx6.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="http://img440.imageshack.us/img440/322/dscn0148qc8.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The on / off button of the speakers was inserted into the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/modding/41229/">pipe with the diaphragm</a> , while the rest of the controls (the so-called basses, volume, ear jack and diode) were put into a special unit that I placed near the bed (so that my wife could turn down my music to a comfortable level ).  This block was made from the remaining case details of the columns - after cutting it was carefully processed with a file, painted in silver.  After all this, I decided to ‚Äúcover‚Äù it with the same artificial skin :) <br><br><img src="http://img136.imageshack.us/img136/2423/dscn0151zt2.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="http://img440.imageshack.us/img440/8284/dscn0152ku2.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="http://img440.imageshack.us/img440/8979/dscn0154fl7.jpg" alt="image"><br>  It would be more time, would make sex)) <br><br>  Gathering all the details together, the following system came up: <br><br><img src="http://img136.imageshack.us/img136/5994/dscn0159fr7.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="http://img440.imageshack.us/img440/530/dscn0161hx0.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="http://img440.imageshack.us/img440/17/dscn0165kl8.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="http://img440.imageshack.us/img440/3997/dscn0166jb5.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0zYsC5znug8" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Approximately the same, only with comments. <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5whbrrfbpdg" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Especially for the competition <b><a href="http://topmods.net/rendom.php">King of Modding</a></b> <br><br>  <b>Successes!</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/41238/">https://habr.com/ru/post/41238/</a></p>
