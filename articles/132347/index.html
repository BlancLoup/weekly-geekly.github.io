I thought it would be interesting for the Hub community to look at the numbers that were achieved in this small open source project. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  What was done </h4><br>  I will begin, perhaps, with the list of functions that were made and released this month.  Here are the most difficult of them (plus a bunch of small ones, which are not serious to say :)): <br><ul><li>  "Market" plug-ins - in fact, a directory of plug-ins to search for music with a setting of 1 click </li><li>  System extensions for the interface - allows you to create extensions that can literally change anything </li><li>  Integration with the new Facebook Opengrap API - publication of the Spotifey-style listened tracks (still in the process of approval in the backyard of Facebook) </li><li>  Scrobbling on lastfm </li><li>  Playlists </li><li>  Search by video and mood </li><li>  Radio section </li></ul><br><h4>  What happened in a month </h4><br>  Now some interesting numbers (statistics and all that).  But first I want to note that there were no particularly tricky attempts to promote the application (paid advertising, for example).  At the time of launch, I made publications on habr, ycombinator, reddit and leprosy.  It should be noted that on the same reddit the post was not noticed at all (although maybe I just do not know how to write them).  So now the numbers themselves. <br><br>  Perhaps I'll start with the repository.  At the moment, the repository on the githab has 46 observers and 3 fork.  In total, 77 issues were closed this month, which took more than 4,000 lines.  A separate design repository was created so that everyone could participate in the process.

      The penultimate version of Myelofon (v0.2.3, it has been hanging the longest without updating) was downloaded more than 5000 times!  Most interestingly, more than 10% of downloads fall on the version for Linux systems. <br>  More than 500 followers on Twitter and over 300 likes on Facebook have been recruited over the month. <br>  Every day, an average of 300 new visitors visit the myelofon site. <br>  And the most interesting number - donations - in a month about 50 euros were collected in total.  Interestingly, most of the donations were from Russian users (to be honest, I expected a completely different picture). <br><br>  In addition, Mielofon was added to several software catalogs: filecluster, brothersoft and softpedia.  And after the addition I was just put before the fact with the help of email.  For the badges hung on the site, the directories were promised to be placed in the recommended software section (the badges were hung, but whether they were placed or not, they were not checked). <br>  Also, almost immediately after launch, I wrote lifehacker.com about Myelofon.  Unfortunately, this did not increase the number of downloads at all.  But it gave ~ 10k video views on YouTube. <br><br>  If there are any questions that I have not covered in the article, I am ready to answer (if possible).  It will be very interesting to see what will happen with the project further. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/132347/">https://habr.com/ru/post/132347/</a></p>
