  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Free programs for remote control of computers</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Remote computer control programs allow you to remotely control another computer over the Internet or on a local network.  This is convenient when it is necessary to help a not very experienced user, for example, a relative or friend who is not well versed in a computer, to do something on it, without leaving his comfortable chair and not wasting his nerves and time for telephone conversations.  Such programs are still conveniently used for remote work, for example, from home to connect to the office and vice versa - to access your home PC, for system administration of a whole fleet of computers and servers. <br><br>  We will conduct a comparative analysis of remote control programs and highlight their advantages and disadvantages. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Teamviewer </h4><br>  One of the most popular programs for remote access, it can be quickly downloaded and installed or immediately launched, without installation, even a very experienced user will be able to handle it.  At startup, the program displays a window with the ID and password for access to this computer, and also TeamViewer allows you to connect to another computer by specifying its ID and password. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/85b/ea7/fff/85bea7fffafa00beb64e72ae2ab0d4d8.png" alt="image">

      <i>Benefits:</i> <br>  The program has several basic modes of operation: remote control, file transfer, chat, demonstration of your desktop.  The program allows you to configure round-the-clock access to a computer, it will be convenient for system administration.  The speed of work is quite decent, there are versions for all mobile platforms, for various operating systems, which is very pleasing.  A simple and well-understood interface, plus a number of additional utilities for expanding the functionality of the program, will be useful for remote support services. <br><br>  <i>Disadvantages:</i> <br>  Although the program is free, but only for non-commercial use, as well as working with it for more than 5 minutes, a number of difficulties arise, for example, TV can block a remote connection session, recognizing it as commercial use.  For round-the-clock remote access or administration of several computers, a computer network, you will have to pay for additional program modules.  The cost of the program is high. <br><br>  <i>Total:</i> <br>  This program is ideal for a one-time remote connection or use it for short periods of time.  It is convenient to use from mobile platforms, but not to administer a large number of computers.  For additional modules will have to pay extra. <br><br>  Website: <a href="http://www.teamviewer.com/ru/">TeamViewer</a> <br><br><h4>  LiteManager </h4><br>  A simple but pretty powerful program consists of two parts, the first is the Server that needs to be installed or run on a remote computer and the Viewer, which allows you to control another computer.  To work, the program requires a little more skills and experience from the manager, although the server‚Äôs work is even simpler than in TeamViewer, the server can be set once and no more actions from the user are needed, the ID will always be permanent, you can even set it yourself manually, very convenient to memorize.  LiteManager Free is free for personal and commercial use. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/742/b9a/0ec/742b9a0ec682bcf1bf6de4585a12e752.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <i>Benefits:</i> <br>  In addition to the main modes of remote access: remote control, file transfer, chat, task manager, registry editor, there are also unique functions, for example: inventory, screen recording, remote installation.  The program is free for use on 30 computers, it can be used for round-the-clock access without any additional modules.  There are no time limits.  It is possible to configure your own server ID to configure corporate support services.  In the program there are no restrictions on the time of work and blocking. <br><br>  <i>Disadvantages:</i> <br>  There is not enough client for mobile platforms or other systems, there are restrictions on 30 computers in the free version, to administer a larger number, you need to purchase a license.  Some specific modes of operation are only available in the Pro version. <br><br>  <i>Total:</i> <br>  The Litemanager program is suitable for providing remote support, for administering several dozen computers absolutely free of charge, for setting up your own remote support service.  The cost of the program is the lowest in its segment and the license is not limited in time. <br><br>  Website: <a href="http://www.litemanager.ru/">Litemanager</a> <br><br><h4>  Ammy admin </h4><br>  The program is basically similar to TeamViewer, but a simpler option.  There are only basic modes of operation - viewing and management, file transfer, chat.  The program can work without installation, free for non-commercial use. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6c8/7fb/373/6c87fb3732bb6d869495bd3d71ff7a5d.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <i>Benefits:</i> <br>  A simple and easy program, you can work both on the Internet and in a local network, has minimal settings and does not require any special skills.  In comparison with TeamViewer, a softer licensing policy. <br><br>  <i>Disadvantages:</i> <br>  Minimum functions for remote management, it will be difficult to administer a large fleet of computers, with long-term use, more than 15 hours per month, a session can be limited or blocked, paid for commercial use, <br><br>  <i>Total:</i> <br>  This program is more suitable for a one-time connection to a computer and not very complicated manipulations, for example, as a help to an inexperienced user in setting up a computer. <br><br>  Website: <a href="http://www.ammyy.com/ru/">Ammy admin</a> <br><br><h4>  RAdmin </h4><br>  One of the first remote control programs and known in its circle, could not fail to mention it, more intended for system administration, the main emphasis was placed on security.  The program consists of two: server and client components.  It requires installation, it will not be easy for an experienced user to deal with it, the program is designed mainly for work by IP address, which is not very convenient for rendering those.  support via the Internet.  The program is paid, but has a free test period. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e02/f83/56a/e02f8356af7a20dbd502084f730dba2d.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  <i>Benefits:</i> <br>  The program has a high speed, especially in a good network, thanks to the video capture driver of the desktop, increased reliability and security.  Built-in Intel AMT technology that allows you to connect to the BIOS of a remote computer and configure it.  Implemented only the main modes of operation, remote control, file transfer, chat, etc. <br><br>  <i>Disadvantages:</i> <br>  Almost no opportunity to work without an IP address, i.e.  connect by id.  There is no client for mobile systems.  No free version, only a test period of 30 days.  To work with the program requires the skills of an experienced user.  When you connect a video driver can disable the Aero GUI, sometimes the screen flashes. <br><br>  <i>Total:</i> <br>  The program is more suitable for system administrators to administer computers and servers on the local network.  To work over the Internet, you may have to configure a VPN tunnel. <br><br>  Website: <a href="http://www.radmin.ru/">RAdmin</a> <br><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4><br>  There are many more similar programs for remote access, these are newer (Airoadmin, Supremo), a bit outdated (VNC, Dameware, PCAnywhere) and other more expensive beautiful ones, but performing the same basic functions.  If you decide to purchase a license, please note that some programs are licensed for temporary use for a year, after which you have to pay more and more. <br><br>  I think you can choose a suitable program for yourself, or it is best to use several solutions in the complex. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/244355/">https://habr.com/ru/post/244355/</a></p>
