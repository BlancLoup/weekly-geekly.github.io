Today it is not so important, because the tools that are designed to easily increase sales conversion come to the aid of employees. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  You made a big deal.  What could be better?  Nothing compares with the feeling that you, it was you who benefited the company you work for, and that the time you spent on making a deal paid off in full.  Yes, when work goes and customers go in jambs - you are the king of the hill.  And what happens in those days when you make zero sales?  When is everything bad?  When everything seems sad and sad? <br><br>  Let's face it, not everyone can be a seller.  This profession requires perseverance, stability and patience, and if you possess these qualities, then this work will be your vocation, which will pay off.

      Let's be honest, there are days that are no good.  If you already have sales experience, then you are undoubtedly already aware of this dark side. <br><br>  Many people still use old methods in sales, when new features and technologies come to the aid of every seller.  Let's look at the problematic sides of sales and how to turn them into benefits in order to increase revenue.  One example would be the <a href="http://www.carrotquest.io/%3Futm_source%3Dmegam%26utm_medium%3Dcontent%26utm_content%3D7veshey%26utm_campaign%3Dsale" rel="nofollow">Carrot Quest</a> service, which automates marketing processes and allows for increased conversion. <br><br><h2>  1. Work for bonuses </h2><br>  <strong>What is bad:</strong> most often the seller receives a salary plus interest from sales or transactions.  Yes, with special zeal efforts will pay off the salary premium, but we confess: this work directly depends on how effective you are.  But if suddenly the black stripe began, you will have to be content with a salary. <br><br>  <strong>What is cool:</strong> the more you try at work, the more money you bring home as a bonus.  Many sellers say that this is the main incentive, so they are willing to put up with the fact that sales sometimes fall. <br><br>  Yes, the risk - it is worthwhile.  Real sellers know that, despite the small salary and as yet unknown and unguaranteed interest, the risk always pays off.  The more you invest yourself in sales - the more it all brings benefits and profits. <br><br>  Here everything is transparent and simple, because the RFP is proportional to sales.  In other positions, the formulas are more complicated, which is why employers are afraid of tying employees to profits and making money several times more becomes impossible.  Everything is possible in sales, you can use almost any tools to improve your results. <br><br><h2>  2. Your success depends on the decision of the potential client. </h2><br>  <strong>What is bad:</strong> no matter how many calls you made, how many letters you sent, how much you laid out today, the end result of your activity ultimately still depends on the decision of the prospective client. <br><br>  <strong>What is cool:</strong> newcomers to sales often focus on one or another side of the work, forgetting that, as elsewhere, sales are important complexity: quality and quantity.  If you approach the process wisely, the result is guaranteed. <br><br>  In general, the result depends on how you studied the needs of each client.  Knowing what interests them and what their motives are, you will make the most current offer. <br><br>  Let me give you an example of our service. <a href="http://www.carrotquest.io/%3Futm_source%3Dmegam%26utm_medium%3Dcontent%26utm_content%3D7veshey%26utm_campaign%3Dsale" rel="nofollow">Carrot Quest</a> is a service that knows the information about each visitor on your site: <br><br><ul><li>  what pages did he look at </li><li>  what buttons pressed </li><li>  what channel came from </li><li>  what is his name etc. </li></ul><br>  ... and allows on the basis of these data to bring 3 times more visitors to purchase. <br><br>  When you know <br><br><ul><li>  what this user did on your site </li><li>  see the whole history of communication with him (it does not matter, he wrote in the chat or in the mail - everything is stored in one place), </li><li>  "Follow" him in real time, </li><li>  know which channel it came from (for example, on what request from contextual advertising) </li></ul><br>  ... then, without any problems, you will understand what to emphasize in order to convey the value of your proposal. <br><br>  Even more features appear when you have made the integration of the Carrot Quest with other services.  For example, call tracking services and CRM.  You have a complete picture of your client on hand.  Communications are 2 orders of magnitude better. <br><br>  Personalization and an integrated approach will carry your results into space. <br><br><h2>  3. Do you have a plan </h2><br>  <strong>What is bad:</strong> everything in the life of the seller decides the sales plan.  The plan hangs over you, even if at other points at work everything is fine.  And imagine, if that black streak of life has come?  In this case, the plan is seen as a kind of sword of Damocles hanging above your head. <br><br>  <strong>What is cool:</strong> it is worth remembering that the management, giving you a sales plan, does not take these numbers from the ceiling.  Everything is carefully calculated and regulated (well, almost everything).  Raising a plan can be just a sign that a business is growing. <br><br>  In other words, the strongest survives.  The plan is a kind of measure of whether the seller gives all the best, or somewhere he is free-standing and takes time off from work, or does it not well enough. <br><br>  To fulfill the plan, first of all you have to start working with more ‚Äúhot‚Äù leads that have already considered buying from you.  In <a href="http://www.carrotquest.io/%3Futm_source%3Dmegam%26utm_medium%3Dcontent%26utm_content%3D7veshey%26utm_campaign%3Dsale" rel="nofollow">Carrot Quest,</a> you can select different segments based on their actions, channels, properties, etc., all of which will help identify the groups of people that you bring to the sale without much effort. <br><br><h2>  4. People think that you just want to ‚Äúpush‚Äù the goods. </h2><br>  <strong>What is bad:</strong> those customers who already had the ‚Äúgood fortune‚Äù to meet an annoying and persistent sales manager begin to block all attempts of an even more pleasant seller. <br><br>  <strong>What is good</strong> : people often refuse to help the sales manager, because  we are sure that they will be thrown into an endless stream of calls and letters advertising goods that they simply do not need.  However, if you are sure that the user needs your product, that he will benefit them, then it‚Äôs up to the smallest. <br><br>  Top sellers realize that it is much better, instead of forcibly imposing a service, to podgadat the moment when the client came to a decision and helped him to deal with this decision.  Be responsive and helpful. <br><br>  Let me give you an interesting example of an online chat, which we described in the article <a href="http://www.carrotquest.io/blog/38-prodazh-za-schet-onlajn-konsultanta-dlya-sajta-kak-dobitsya-takogo-pokazatelya/" rel="nofollow">‚Äú38% of sales through online chat.</a>  <a href="http://www.carrotquest.io/blog/38-prodazh-za-schet-onlajn-konsultanta-dlya-sajta-kak-dobitsya-takogo-pokazatelya/" rel="nofollow">How to achieve such an indicator</a> .  It turned out that a large percentage of users fall off at the last stage of the purchase due to a sense of risk.  They are one on one with the monitor screen and no one can help them make a decision.  This complexity is solved by chat rooms (online consultants), because they are the only way to somehow contact the client at such a moment.  According to research, chat rooms provide 38% of all sales, and precisely because of the last step. <br><br>  We went a little further.  We track users in real time ( <a href="http://www.carrotquest.io/blog/urok-5-razdel-live-kak-v-rezhime-realnogo-vremeni-otsledit-posetitelya-sajta-i-sdelat-prodazhu/" rel="nofollow">live mode in service</a> ) and see which of the stages of the purchase is each.  Therefore, we begin to actively communicate with users when they are about to buy.  This move helps to convince about 30% of those who otherwise would not have bought. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/a90/d01/f22/a90d01f226f02cc65290f798dfc79ffa.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  5. Yes, it is monotonous work. </h2><br>  <strong>What is bad:</strong> to achieve success in sales, you need to repeat the same action many times.  Once you realize that you are already fed up with the phrase ‚ÄúYes, our service is the best, since we have ...‚Äù. <br><br>  <strong>What is cool:</strong> the very everyday actions that are boring to hell ultimately become the building blocks of business that build companies a clear line and a large volume of sales, thereby ensuring profit and prosperity. <br><br>  There is a way out; you have to segment the audience and work with it in stages.  Highlight cold, warm and hot leads.  For each group there should be individual working methods.  Do not waste your time on unpromising customers. <br><br><h2>  6. You sell the same thing. </h2><br>  <strong>What is bad:</strong> constantly talking about the same thing.  About the same service, thing, product, service. <br><br>  <strong>What is cool:</strong> each subsequent sale is unlike the previous one.  Despite all the similarities, each client is unique with their problems and needs.  At the same time, you become a kind of expert in your field who can really provide the client with exactly what he needs.  And if there is a feeling of deja vu, just change the outline of your usual communication with a client or a segment of clients. <br><br><h2>  7. No - that's all I hear. </h2><br>  <strong>What is bad:</strong> yes, it is unpleasant when you are refused.  Worse, only when you were refused 10 times in a row. <br><br>  <strong>What's cool:</strong> Humble yourself.  Hearing constantly ‚Äúno‚Äù from customers is an integral part of this work, it is embedded in the sales process itself.  The most important thing is not to be discouraged and not to indulge in sadness when you are refused, but to instantly reorganize to a new client, to provide him with all those services and goods that the previous client so unwisely refused. <br><br>  Let's sum up.  To sell is indeed a vocation.  Your personal qualities, of course, influence the way you perceive this job and the characteristics of this profession.  If what you read above has confused you - think carefully about whether you should go on sale.  If you are ready to face all these difficulties and receive for this quite good premium and percent from sales, then dare. <br><br>  With pleasure, the team of the <a href="http://www.carrotquest.io/%3Futm_source%3Dmegam%26utm_medium%3Dcontent%26utm_content%3D7veshey%26utm_campaign%3Dsale" rel="nofollow">Carrot Quest</a> service, which knows all the information about each user on your site and with this knowledge in mind, allows you to increase the conversion to the first and second sale (via chat, pop-up or email). <br><br>  Based on <a href="http://www.hubspot.com/" rel="nofollow">HubSpot</a> <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/296260/">https://habr.com/ru/post/296260/</a></p>
