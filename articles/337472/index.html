We decided to arrange a holiday test for the ASCON testing specialists themselves and asked them to answer a number of tricky questions about themselves and how the hunt for errors occurs not only in software, but also in everyday life.  It turned out that our guys are not averse to testing spacecraft, computer games and wines, they enjoy the bugs they found, but they are favorable to the imperfections of this world, get out of difficult situations with the help of their meticulousness and equally well understand both developers and users. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/f3f/2d3/e9c/f3f2d3e9c64c4c9189d651702bd8ed51.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Caution traffic</b> . <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  <font color="#00B2FF">Blitz for a real tester</font> </h4><br><ul><li>  Does the tester feel like a user or developer? </li><li>  Professional meticulousness in life: what will you do when you find a mistake in the work of products or services? </li><li>  If you could choose any area of ‚Äã‚Äãactivity other than your own, then what would you devote yourself to testing? </li><li>  Did it happen that an error detected in time saved the situation? </li><li>  What qualities a good tester needs in your relatives? </li><li>  What is an ‚Äúexcellent working day‚Äù for a tester: when are there no errors or when are they? </li></ul><br><h4>  <font color="#00B2FF">"I tried the planes, but I would like to take it higher - test the spacecraft!"</font> </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/ca2/273/35f/ca227335f261472990086e3dd9c95ebb.JPG"><br>  Evgeny Filimonov, testing engineer KOMPAS-3D, experience of 5 (full) years

      <b>User or developer?</b>  At first it was the user role that dominated.  Well, an experienced tester is still more an expert on the development side, albeit with user skills.  Knowledge of the development process allows you to look ‚Äúinside‚Äù the system and detect problems that the average user does not notice, but which, for example, can eventually lead to departures within a few hours of continuous work or damage to documents.  Meanwhile, knowledge of the product design process allows us to work out the main scenarios for the use of KOMPAS-3D during verification.  But there may be nuances.  This is my story, but not all testers were lucky enough to work in production! <br><br>  <b>"I can not be silent!"</b> Often finding some problem, I try to bring the information to the creators of the service or product.  For example, I reported problems in Yandex-maps, in tariffs on the MegaFon website.  The mobile operator as a reward transferred me as much as 50 rubles to the account!  I see no reason to restrain myself from these professional manifestations.  If something bothers me, I try to solve the problem.  Sometimes this can be done through informing the creators.  And for other users it will be useful.  After all, this way you can help people without putting virtually any effort.  But, of course, I do not constantly search for errors in someone else's work.  It all depends on the severity of the problem and the appropriateness of informing the creators of the service.  The same applies to products.  For example, if the product is under warranty, and something does not work, then I will certainly contact the service. <br><br>  <b>Instead of tests.</b>  In the tests of aircraft, I have already participated in past work.  And the matter concerned the MiG-29 combat fighters!  But, of course, not as a pilot, but as a specialist in ground testing of aircraft systems.  But it was still very interesting and entertaining.  But now I would take it higher.  I would be happy to take part in testing new-generation spacecraft.  I will reveal one secret, I even participated this year in an open competition for the selection of cosmonauts of the Roskosmos.  But in the end did not pass for medical reasons.  And it was about the flight on the new Russian ship "Federation" and landing on the moon!  I would also take part in testing various technical innovations, some have already entered our lives (for example, quadrocopters, gyroscooters or virtual reality helmets).  Computer games are also an interesting and promising area.  She is close to any man, regardless of his age! <br><br>  <b>Mindfulness is salvation.</b>  With regard to the detection of errors associated with a guaranteed risk to life, I do not recall this.  But here, for example, several times the navigator tried to lead me into the oncoming lane of the one-way road.  And this is a big fine.  Although, of course, there is also a health risk here. <br><br>  <b>The tester can be seen from afar.</b>  In general, in the tester profession, meticulousness (in a good sense), attentiveness, responsibility, perseverance, curiosity, suspicion, and a tendency to destructive thinking (ability to destroy), an urge for experimentation, are important.  Just meticulousness is what relatives notice.  And they don't always like it.  Unplugged iron, light, charging in a power outlet without a phone, garbage - all this causes some irritation.  But one should not think that in a tester‚Äôs family, meticulousness reaches marasmus and he builds a totalitarian society at home.  All in moderation!  Responsibility relatives also notice.  But in a strong and happy family, responsibility is one of the most important qualities.  Also I can be called quite curious.  I am interested in many things, ranging from cars and ending with space. <br><br>  <b>The best day.</b>  For me personally, a great work day at work is when there is a lot of work.  For the tester, there is no ‚Äúno error‚Äù situation, he will always find something.  But seriously, of course, it is more interesting to work in periods of active product development.  At this time, there is a large number of errors.  Timely detection of problems and their solution brings us satisfaction. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/98b/87e/79d/98b87e79d31c5da23a46ae39d8bb3436.gif" alt="image"><br>  <i>In search of bugs</i> <br><br><h4>  <font color="#00B2FF">‚ÄúTesters need a little tediousness, experimentation, and auras of destruction‚Äù</font> </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/976/24d/2bb/97624d2bb31e4227a6fe4152724a239f.jpg"><br>  Ekaterina Yermakova, Test Engineer, CAD VERTIKAL TP, experience 6 (full) years <br><br>  <b>User or developer?</b>  I could not give priority to one of the options, I tend to equivalence.  The tester checks the system, based on the requirements set, taking into account the user's work.  Perhaps I am in the wrong <br><br>  <b>"I can not be silent!"</b> When I buy some thing, I pay great attention to the required functionality, the benefit of our time is a good choice.  When working with services outside of professional life, she did not encounter blocking errors, periodically, of course, wishes arise.  But while they were not voiced, something is holding back. <br><br>  <b>Instead of tests.</b>  I like to visit and discover interesting places for my family, to learn something new - I would choose ‚Äútesting‚Äù tourism, but not extreme. <br><br>  <b>Mindfulness is salvation.</b>  To directly saved, I do not remember.  But recently I encountered a manufacturer‚Äôs mistake in the manufacture of furniture, we decided everything peacefully, the customer is always right - the manufacturer took into account the flaws. <br><br>  <b>The tester can be seen from afar.</b>  The list of qualities for our profession is wide, many of them have been voiced more than once: attentiveness, logical thinking, resourcefulness, curiosity, suspicion, perseverance, patience, and even sociability, a little bit of tediousness and experimentation, and, of course, a bit of aura of destruction . <br>  Well, it seems that the aura of destruction goes with me in life: my acquaintance with my husband began with the repair of the socket (the outlet was uprooted).  Experiments periodically put in the kitchen, not always the first time the result is obtained with a bang, but the spirit does not fall, I try again.  I bother my son with instructions and love to talk. <br><br>  <b>The best day.</b>  There is no code without errors - there are always errors, in connection with this the working day was successful only when a subtle error was caught. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/564/71a/442/56471a442cfbe7d1423fda4577da2db8.gif" alt="image"><br>  <i>How programmers see testers</i> <br><br><h4>  <font color="#00B2FF">‚ÄúClose ones don't even realize that I work as a tester‚Äù</font> </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/f65/006/d24/f65006d241d445cfa105ab6ea800babc.JPG"><br>  Vyacheslav Teplinsky, LOTSMAN automated testing system engineer: PLM, experience 9 (full) years <br><br>  <b>User or developer?</b>  A tester is an engineering profession.  For competent software testing it is necessary to have technical knowledge.  It is not enough to be a confident PC user, at least you need to have basic skills of administering application programs, services and popular operating systems. <br><br>  You also need to have a basic understanding of programming languages: scripting languages ‚Äã‚Äãand high-level languages.  Ideally, it would be good to know the basics of the development language in which the test project is written.  It is also important to have the ability to read the code, not to be afraid to look into it and, if necessary, to help the developer deal with the problem.  So definitely not a user! <br><br>  <b>"I can not be silent!"</b> In life, I am a perfectionist in relation to myself and to others.  I do not hesitate to point out the error to its author, the only thing I try to choose the correct form for such a message. <br><br>  <b>Instead of tests.</b>  Yes, I wanted to try a lot of things and would like to try: to be a surgeon, a fisherman on a fishing vessel, an employee at the Emergencies Ministry, etc. <br><br>  <b>Mindfulness is salvation.</b>  Yes, it happened like this: for example, I discovered errors in the wiring of an apartment, saved at least electrical appliances. <br><br>  <b>The tester can be seen from afar.</b>  Close ones do not even realize that I work as a tester.  It is important for them that I am alive and well, I have a job, and it is well paid.  The most important qualities for the tester, as well as for any other specialist, are to be plastic and trained. <br><br>  <b>The best day.</b>  Tester's ‚Äúexcellent working day‚Äù is the day you learn about the ‚Äúhard working day‚Äù from the developer.  So there is a lot of ‚Äúwork on the mistakes‚Äù ahead, and the result of this work is a quality product. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b19/d7d/8da/b19d7d8da6274537d629e72f17c41a7a.gif" alt="image"><br>  <i>Sometimes testing is very fun.</i> <br><br><h4>  <font color="#00B2FF">"The houses say:" Do not touch, everything will break right away! "</font> </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/2fb/828/b91/2fb828b9138f494bbfe4e6266543219f.jpg"><br>  Inna Mizyukevich, GULF STREAM Production Management System Testing Engineer, experience 1 (full) year <br><br>  <b>User or developer?</b>  A tester is, in my opinion, a system user.  The inventor, the experimenter, for whom all the impossible is possible. <br><br>  <b>"I can not be silent!"</b> No, in life I do not carp.  I try to treat the imperfections of the world with acceptance, understanding. <br><br>  <b>Instead of tests.</b>  As a consumer, it would take to test a new Honda CRV 2017, or a new direction of a tour operator, or a home superbote-assistant ... Well, another ‚Äútime-of-day magnifier‚Äù or ‚Äútime machine‚Äù! <br><br>  <b>Mindfulness is salvation.</b>  Happened all!  For example, in the designer‚Äôs work on the printing house, errors were found on time, it happened that a whole circulation was saved, and this was sometimes millions of copies ... Immediately after the university I worked as a teacher, and there one mistake found in the examination paper, tested by the highest category teacher, saved an excellent student assessment ... Here are just me after this incident, a colleague with the highest category of dislike and in every way harmed in the work. <br><br>  <b>The tester can be seen from afar.</b>  In the profession of tester important attentiveness, consistency, criticality, the ability to analyze and think outside the box, quickly switch and distribute their time.  As well as tactfulness to fellow programmers, but at the same time perseverance, the ability to persuade and patience.  Those close to them note a critical approach to everything that happens and more often say: ‚ÄúDo not touch, everything will break with you at once!‚Äù <br><br>  <b>The best day.</b>  A great work day is a day when the error found by the customer has already been fixed in the code. <br><br><h4>  <font color="#00B2FF">‚ÄúA tester is a technician who knows the system better than users.‚Äù</font> </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/6b1/50d/62e/6b150d62eb3945caa24167e4d7f5ea47.jpg"><br>  Elena Makarova, Testing Engineer for BIM-system Renga Architecture, experience 3 (full) years <br><br>  <b>User or developer?</b>  It is quite difficult to choose one of these options.  I would combine two concepts: a tester is a technician who knows the system better than users. <br><br>  <b>"I can not be silent!"</b> Of course, when I encounter some errors, I try to inform the creators about them.  This is important because I want to use quality services and programs. <br><br>  <b>Instead of tests.</b>  An interesting question, never thought about it.  I think it would be interesting to taste the wines.  I love to try different wines with new dishes. <br><br>  <b>Mindfulness is salvation.</b>  Yes, this happened, however, only in work.  From the last release is remembered, when a critical error was found in the functionality, which in no case should not have been users.  And it was discovered the day before the release. <br><br>  <b>The tester can be seen from afar.</b>  A good tester should be attentive, scrupulous, responsible, with good imagination.  My relatives note in me a desire for order and responsibility.  And she noted for herself that I like to plan everything: plan a vacation to the smallest detail, a weekend. <br><br>  <b>The best day.</b>  If you talk sensibly, then, of course, when there are no errors.  After all, if the tester says that he did not find any errors in the system, then it works according to the stated requirements.  However, when I cannot find an error in the functional, I begin to doubt and periodically return to it, trying to look at the task from the other side. <br><br><h4>  <font color="#00B2FF">‚ÄúAny bug fix saves the user and tech support from pain and suffering‚Äù</font> </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/5fb/47b/f98/5fb47bf98c1941a09961d1a49408b2e8.jpg"><br>  Evgeny Chernyuk, an engineer for the quality department of development of standard solutions, is testing LOTSMAN: KB and ‚Äú8D.  Management of inconsistencies ", experience 5 (full) years <br><br>  <b>User or developer?</b>  A tester is more of a development specialist, essentially acting as a ‚Äúbarrier‚Äù between developers and users.  A tester (again, depending on which company / team he is working at and what qualifications he has), should know: testing methods, OS, DBMS, programming languages, software and automation frameworks.  Also an integral part of the tester's work is participation in all product life cycles.  There are a lot of areas in testing, for example, the user of the system should deal with usability.  Therefore, it is clear that a tester is a development specialist is also wrong. <br><br>  <b>‚ÄúI can‚Äôt be silent!‚Äù</b> I don‚Äôt remember to write about errors in the work of products.  But on the work of software, it happens, I write, but I give developers time to think again.  The last angry letter was written in Megafon due to incorrect display of the balance (x2). <br><br>  <b>Instead of tests.</b>  Computer games - with two hands "for"!  And more is not necessary (our PUGB is all). <br><br>  <b>Mindfulness is salvation.</b>  In fact, any corrected error saves the user and technical support from pain and suffering.  There was a case with the bugtracker database backup script.  After creating the backup, he was immediately removed.  The script was launched according to the schedule, and, in fact, we had no backups for some time. <br><br>  <b>The tester can be seen from afar.</b>  Close ones probably note distrustfulness (inaccurately), one of the favorite phrases in everyday life is ‚ÄúTrust, but check.‚Äù Quality is inherent in a successful tester: curiosity, patience (especially when dealing with the development), ‚Äúa sense of destruction‚Äù (you know in advance where there will be errors in the next iteration). <br><br>  <b>The best day.</b>  A great work day for me is the release of a product release, or when the automation you wrote found at least one bug.  The errors found, of course, bring pleasure, but the moment of regression testing comes, and then the errors found already bring pain. <br><br><h4>  <font color="#00B2FF">‚ÄúThe presence of errors is not always good, but the absence of errors does not mean that they do not exist‚Äù</font> </h4><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/66c/3a2/c49/66c3a2c4981448279289029ca9bec49d.jpg"><br>  Stepan Sereda, testing engineer of the project management organization Pilot-ICE, experience 1 (full) year <br><br>  <b>User or developer?</b>  This is both.  You approach testing both as an expert and as a user who will work in the system.  This is what helps to achieve better results. <br><br>  <b>"I can not be silent!"</b> Yes, but it is not enough just to find a mistake, you still need to understand the reasons.  Not always what appears to be a mistake at first glance is such.  And this study does not always have time. <br><br>  <b>Instead of tests.</b>  It would be interesting to test the system for "Smart Home".  They consist of many components, and their interaction with each other is a rather interesting process. <br><br>  <b>Mindfulness is salvation.</b>  It was so.  Once forgot to tighten the wheel at the car.  In time I paid attention to the extraneous sound and found the reason. <br><br>  <b>The tester can be seen from afar.</b>  Curiosity, attention to detail, dedication and ability to work in a team.  These qualities are in me! <br><br>  <b>The best day.</b>  It is difficult to answer this question unequivocally.  The presence of errors is not always good, as their absence does not mean that they are not there.  Therefore, a good day is when you find a mistake on time! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/750/563/9ae/7505639ae42ab569bb4f4f7ff7418e0b.gif" alt="image"><br>  <i>If you do not see an error, it does not mean that it does not exist.</i> <br><br>  <b>Congratulations to all those involved with the Day of the Tester!</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/337472/">https://habr.com/ru/post/337472/</a></p>
