  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Comparison of criminal liability for unlicensed software in Russia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The topic of criminal responsibility of the system administrator (and other computer people) for unlicensed software has been raised many times, but it still remains interesting. <br>  On Habr√© discussed the responsibility in Russia ( <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/57892/">Charge of the system administrator under article 146 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (unlicensed software in the company). Issue 1</a> ) and in Ukraine ( <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/164667/">Application of article 176 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine to the System Administrator (Pirated software)</a> ).  I will tell you about the punishments for such misconduct in Kazakhstan.  But to a greater degree I was interested in comparing the attitude of 3 states to this topic. <br>  I would like to immediately say: I am not a lawyer.  If you find inaccuracies somewhere, do not judge strictly.  Better tell me, and I will fix it. <br>  I was mostly interested in two questions: <br><ul><li>  How easy it is to become a criminal. </li><li>  What is the maximum penalty, taking into account the aggravating (a group of people, in especially large amounts, etc.) can be threatened. </li></ul><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Only in Russia there are strictly two of these boundaries in the criminal code.  There are some intermediate states in Ukraine and Kazakhstan, but they have nothing to do with my questions, so they are absent in the resulting table.  Interested persons can learn information from quotations of articles of the criminal code <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (as amended on 25.11.2013), article 146</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Article 146.

Illegal use of copyright or related rights, as well as the acquisition, storage, transportation of counterfeit copies of works or phonograms for marketing purposes, committed on a large scale - shall be punished with a fine of up to two hundred thousand rubles or in the amount of the salary or other income of the convict for a period of up to eighteen months, either by compulsory labor for up to four hundred and eighty hours, or by correctional labor for up to two years, or by forced labor for up to two years, or  Ishenim liberty for the same period. <br>  3.

In Russia - twice as difficult.  In this case, if the stars do not stand up well, then you can immediately get a deadline. <br>  But with the maximum punishment all have everything in different ways. <br>  In Russia and Ukraine, if you are lucky, even in the case of damage on a large scale, you can remain at large.  In Ukraine, in general, you can only get off with a fine (although the fine, I must say, is not the smallest).  But in Kazakhstan, not only is it enough to cause damage at only $ 5,500 (this is one fully configured server from Microsoft), you also have to sit anyway. <br><br>  The findings show that although all three states have a lot in common, they all relate to this crime differently: someone prefers to penalize more strongly, and someone immediately imprisons. <br><br><h5>  NMDG value </h5><br>  When discussing the article, some doubts arose about the value of NMDG (the non-taxable minimum income of citizens) in Ukraine.  There are several options: <br><ul><li>  the value adopted in the table is correct, that is, NMDG = 573.5 (this is for 2013, in 2014 - 609); </li><li>  to classify the damage caused, it is necessary to use the value of NMDG in 573.5, and to calculate the amount of fines - 17; </li><li>  the correct value is NMDG - 17. </li></ul><br>  Such discrepancies cause vagueness of the formulation: <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Tax Code of Ukraine, Section XX, subsection 1, paragraph 5.</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  If the norms of other laws contain references to the non-taxable minimum incomes of citizens, then for the purpose of their application, an amount of 17 hryvnias is used, except for administrative and criminal legislation regarding the qualification of crimes or offenses, for which the amount of the non-taxable minimum is set at the level of tax social benefits defined subparagraph 169.1.1 of paragraph 169.1 of Article 169 of Section IV of this Code for the relevant year. <br></div></div><br>  Information on the Internet is also a difference: <a href="http://www.buhoblik.org.ua/nalogi/nalogovoe-pravo/492-neoblagaemyj-minimum-2013.html">they say that it is necessary to use the value 573.5</a> , and <a href="http://www.sai.gov.ua/ua/admpractice/1.htm">on the website of the SAI they use the value 17</a> . <br>  Unfortunately, we could not find any references to court verdicts, by which one could unambiguously understand what meaning the judges use.  Therefore, in the table I will leave the value 573.5 only because the resulting figures obtained with this value of the NMDG look more logical in comparison with the figures for other states.
