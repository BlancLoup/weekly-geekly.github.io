  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Conference C ++ Russia 2018</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello!  I hope you managed to miss the plus reports and communication with colleagues, because the next <a href="http://cppconf.ru/">C ++ Russia</a> conference is just around the corner.  This year the conference will again be held in the city of three revolutions. <br><br>  The conference will be held April 19-21 in St. Petersburg.  April 19 is the day of master classes, 20-21 is the main program.  Jon Kalb opens the first day of the conference.  Topics of the conference reports: memory, crash reports, asynchrony, software transactional memory, reflective metaprogramming, ranges, actors, Herb Sutter. <br><br>  Details under the cut. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Reports </h3><br>  So, Jon Kalb will open the conference: an experienced programmer, a very good speaker, the organizer of CppCon and the author of the book <i>C ++ Today: The Beast is Back</i> .  The second day begins with a report by Daveed Vandevoorde, a member of the standardization committee, one of the authors of the book <i>C ++ Templates: The Complete Guide</i> .

      A section of two reports on memory will be held by Fedor Korotky and Alexey Salmin.  Both reports were presented at the meetings and supplemented on the basis of discussions.  The first report is a story about how the memory is arranged, which we often do not think about at all;  about the architecture of one of the most popular allocators on the example of jemalloc.  The second report is devoted to the lower level: features of mmap and madvise in linux. <br><br>  Last year, Coursera began to publish an excellent course on C ++.  Ilya Shishkov, one of the authors of the course, will share his experience.  The report is not only for teachers, but also for experienced programmers: sharing experience and skills is usually even more difficult than writing programs. <br><br>  I am most often asked to invite three speakers: Bjarne, Herb and Andrei.  I write to them regularly, but they politely refuse.  And this year Herb took pity on me (or was tired of my letters) and offered to give a report remotely.  I do not like this format of reports, but in the case of him I decided to take a risk: firstly, he is a great speaker, and secondly, it is interesting to try.  So, this year we will have Herb Sutter on Skype. <br><br><h3>  Master Classes </h3><br>  Four master classes will be presented at the conference.  Two of them were on C ++ Russia 2017, two more new ones.  The most common question about master classes: why so expensive?  Last year we did workshops for the first time and decided to check how interesting they were to the participants.  The price was so small because only authors' fees were included in the price.  We paid rent of premises and food from our own pocket.  The master classes gathered a full house and we decided that this year we could still not make them unprofitable.  Now the cost of the ticket covers the rent, meals and the fee to the author. <br><br><h3>  Student program </h3><br>  As always, we are happy to support students in their quest for knowledge and communication.  In order to get a discount, you need to send a photo or scan of a student / gradebook / graduate student to the address <a href="">students@cpp-russia.ru</a> <br><br><h3>  Online tickets </h3><br>  When buying an online ticket, you will receive an individual link and you can watch any report in real time.  After the conference, videotapes of reports will be available via this link for two months. <br><br>  Your comments, suggestions, and complaints are very important to us.  Write to us at conf@cpp-russia.ru.  We also made a <a href="https://telegram.me/joinchat/CMhk-j_waI8vac99lMYOFQ">general chat in a telegram</a> .  I hope he will help resolve issues more quickly. <br><br>  See you at the conference! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/346994/">https://habr.com/ru/post/346994/</a></p>
