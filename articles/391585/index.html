  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Realism - the ideology of the New World</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> <i>I give to the public beta test a political system for countries with economies primarily based on the exploitation of the human capital of engineers and scientists.</i>  <i>The current system version is 0.9.</i>  <i>Constructive criticism and additions are welcome.</i> <br><br>  It is already clear that the old ideologies that guided the political forces of the XIX-XX centuries in the XXI century completely outdated themselves due to the change of the economic system, the destruction of the proletariat as the main exploited class, as well as the loss of trust by the old political elites.  These processes are associated with the replacement of working specialties with robotic self-managed systems, the emergence of a new massively exploited class of engineers to replace the outdated proletariat, the emergence of a higher social class of engineers as an exploiting class, the increase of social inequality directly related to inequality of intellectual, replacement of investments in the means of production with investments in human capital.  Social relationships, the types of social stratification, the educational system, political and economic ideologies - everything undergoes a radical break when the underlying social economy changes.  I have repeatedly written about all these transformations, as well as about the fact that dramatic changes in the field of universal introduction of robotization and automation based on progress in the field of weak Artificial Intelligence will inevitably lead the old post-industrial world to increasing economic inefficiency and gradual replacement with the world knowledge economy, ‚Äùthe New World, creating a much greater surplus value per unit of sales.  We can say that it is the New World that will be the world that the biblical prophets described under the term ‚ÄúOlam abaa‚Äù, however, considering how this very New World looked like in the refraction of the mentality of people who lived 3,000 years ago. <br><br>  New realities always require new thinking.  Obviously, the old socio-political approaches that worked effectively at the dawn of the industrial age with global changes in the structure of the economy are no longer viable.  Just as the socio-political approaches inherent in feudalism became unviable during the bourgeois Industrial Revolution and the development of capitalism, which exploited machines as a means of production and workers as the control circuit of machine tools.  Let's think together about what principles should be put in the basis of the social and political system of the New World in order to be adequate to radical changes in the basis of the economy.  First, we formulate thesis, then write down each item in more detail. <br><a name="habracut"></a>

      A) Rights, obligations, freedoms, responsibility <br><br>  1. Every person in society has rights, the volume of which is identically equal to the duties of a person to society. <br>  2. Every person in society has freedoms that impose on the person the responsibility for applying them. <br>  3. The scope of rights and freedoms in society is limited, since unlimited rights and freedoms entail, theoretically, unlimited duties and responsibilities, and in reality - unrestrictedness and permissiveness not limited by anything. <br>  4. The specific rights and duties of a person before society, as well as freedoms and responsibilities, are a function of the role that a person in society voluntarily assumes. <br>  5. The state should create and monitor the implementation of the rules governing the specific implementation of rights and obligations, freedoms and responsibilities in society. <br>  6. Setting the basic parameters of rights and obligations, freedoms and responsibilities, is the subject of a social contract. <br><br>  B) State authorities <br><br>  1. The authorities are separated from each other, their interaction is aimed at the benefit of the entire community of citizens in general and is based on competition and cooperation. <br>  2. State authorities shall be formed by means of an anonymous will of members of a society having the right to vote, which is available for inspection by the society and independent observers. <br>  3. The composition of the highest judicial authority is formed by the anonymous will of all members of society with a higher legal education and vested with the right to vote, accessible by the public and independent observers. <br>  4. The composition of citizens having the right to vote is formed on the basis of a social contract. <br><br>  C) Possible options for granting citizens the right to vote <br><br>  IN 1.  Based on formal attributes <br><br>  1. Based on the age of a citizen, as well as the absence of a court decision imposing restrictions on the right to vote (the so-called universal suffrage). <br>  2. Based on the positive balance of the citizen's contribution to the public good (the amount of taxes paid exceeds the amount of benefits received), as well as the absence of a court decision imposing restrictions on the right to vote.  In this case, it is possible and proportional endowment - the more taxes paid, the more votes you can cast in elections. <br>  3. Based on the ownership of real estate, as well as the lack of a court decision imposing restrictions on the right to elect.  In this case, it is possible and proportional endowment - the more there is real estate in the property, the more votes can be submitted at the elections. <br>  4. Based on the passage of a citizen of socially significant service, enshrined in a social contract, as well as the absence of a judicial decision imposing restrictions on the right to elect (a particular example is technocracy). <br><br>  AT 2.  Based on informal signs <br><br>  1. Based on the passage of a specialized open and public judicial examination for the right to vote, valid for a certain amount of time.  The essence of the exam is to make sure that the applicant is loyal to society, aware of the social and political realities of the current reality, and also mentally adequate.  The criteria on the basis of which the verdict is rendered, as well as the period for which the citizen is given the right to vote, must be subject to a social contract. <br>  2. Based on the abilities and talents of each individual citizen, as well as the absence of a court decision imposing restrictions on the right to elect (meritocracy).  Criteria and mathematical weights for increasing the number of votes available to a citizen in elections are accepted on the basis of a social contract. <br><br>  D) State, society and individual <br><br>  1. People are social creatures, because individuals form a collective, and a collective, as a result, forms personalities. <br>  2. People are divided into collectivists and individualists.  Most collectivists strive to obtain the most comfortable position within a congenial team.  Most individualists seek freedom from the power of any collective.  Individualists are much smaller than collectivists. <br>  3. Any social structure is a collective personality. <br>  4. People and social structures are in the process of mutual competition and cooperation. <br>  5. There should be no individuals who prevail over other individuals, except for the parental upbringing of children up to the age of attaining majority, custody of incapable citizens according to a court decision, as well as cases of voluntary consent to this kind of relationship, subject to the cultural and legal framework. <br>  6. Prohibited ideologies, which are based on the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãtotal superiority of one group of people over other groups of people.  Propaganda of such ideologies is also prohibited. <br>  7. The state for the citizen and the citizen for the state: close horizontal relations based on mutual benefit, replacing the outdated vertical relationship between the citizen and the state. <br>  8. The main function of the state is to ensure the security of its citizens both on its own territory and beyond its borders.  The duty of citizens, coupled with the right to security: the payment of taxes and law-abiding. <br>  9. All those who wish the death of a state whose citizens are citizens are automatically deprived of their citizenship by a court decision. <br>  10. The right to private property is the fundamental right of a citizen of a country, private property itself is inviolable.  The duty associated with this right: the protection of their private property from encroachment, both independently and with the help of society and the state. <br>  11. Two main systems of people management on the part of society: culture (morality, language, system of values) and law and order (law and system of coercion to fulfill it). <br>  12. Violence and discrimination are legitimate instruments of influence of society on its individual members.  However, these tools need constant monitoring by the society, as well as adjustment to current realities on the part of the branches of state power. <br>  13. Discrimination is permitted solely on the basis of scientifically proven facts and is aimed at protecting society as a whole and its individual members in particular. <br>  14. Violence is regulated by the laws of the state and aimed at protecting society in general and its individual members in particular. <br>  15. The competitiveness of the state is based on the private initiative of citizens, because society as a whole must support entrepreneurs, as well as ensure their right to success and the right to failure. <br>  16. The strength of any state is based on the strength of the self-organization of its citizens in solving the internal and external problems of society. <br>  17. The wealth of the state is determined by the resources that its citizens voluntarily donate to non-producing basic areas of public interest: fundamental branches of science, culture and charity. <br>  18. The stability of the state structure is determined by the quality of the functioning of ‚Äúsocial elevators‚Äù, and not by the outdated principles of ‚Äúsocial justice‚Äù and the irremovability of the vertical of power. <br>  19. The percentage of the country's citizens working for the state and state-owned companies must be fixed by a public contract so that the private sector of the economy significantly prevails over the state one. <br>  20. The state is aimed at the benefit of the whole society, therefore the branches of power when making decisions should take into account not only the needs of individual citizens and groups of the population, but also the interests of society as a whole.  In the event of a conflict of interest and failure to conclude a compromise agreement, the decision is made in favor of the society.  The basis of the understanding that there is a benefit to society should be based on rigorous scientific data. <br>  21. State decision-making and state accountability to citizens should be as transparent as possible, with the exception of information, the disclosure of which could jeopardize the security of individual citizens and the country as a whole. <br>  22. Social inequality is a consequence of the inequality of intellectual, educational, motivational and energy, and therefore it is fundamentally insoluble and, therefore, must be an acceptable and legitimate tool for motivating citizens wishing to improve their own living conditions. <br>  23. People can be equal only in the face of the law and culture of the state. <br>  24. The system of responsibility for violation of the law carries the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãpreventing crime. <br>  25. The degree of responsibility for crimes must be fully consistent with the severity of the consequences.  Since, often, the consequences of collective crimes are significantly more significant than the crimes of singles, then the punishment must be stronger. <br>  26. Since a group of people is a collective person, the punishment for crimes committed by such a community must in one way or another concern all its members. <br><br>  D) The Basics of the New World <br><br>  1. The basis of the New World is a scientific approach to knowledge. <br>  2. The scientific approach to knowledge is based on rationalism, skepticism and evidence. <br>  3. The system of education in society is based on a strictly scientific basis. <br>  4. The value of rational education and completeness of knowledge. <br>  5. The system of management of society in general and its individual members in particular should be implemented on a scientific basis, taking into account the peculiarities of human behavior as a biological species. <br>  6. Humanism of the New Time is also based on the full acceptance of human nature as a biological object and is formed on the basis of respect for oneself and other people, as well as the inevitability of punishment for manifestations of disrespect for people by individual members of society. <br>  7. Ideas to improve the economy of the state, society and its individual members, providing for the abdication of a person from his biological roots, are considered inhumane. <br><br>  E) The basis of the state, culture, interstate relations <br><br>  1. At the heart of any state lies the state-forming people or a stable conglomerate of peoples. <br>  2. Only that people or a stable conglomerate of peoples who is ready and able to take responsibility for their own future, has the opportunity to build their own state. <br>  3. Culture and traditions of a state-forming people or a stable conglomerate of peoples, the so-called ‚Äúinner culture‚Äù, lies at the heart of the state.  The destruction of the internal culture entails the destruction of the state. <br>  4. The basis of the sovereignty of any country is the presence of citizens who are ready to kill and die for its safety and independence, as well as the ability to build sustainable political, economic and social processes both within the country and at the interstate level. <br>  5. Free competition and cooperation between cultures and economies of different countries of the world is the engine of general progress. <br>  6. There are cultures more adequate to the economic realities of the New World and, therefore, the states and the economy that implement them are more effective.  A more efficient economy is more valuable for the whole world than the rest, therefore the culture underlying such an economy is also more valuable to the world than others. <br>  7. Those who come to the country from the outside and wish to impose on the state the culture of the place from which they came should be considered disloyal members of society.  Society has every right to defend itself against such disloyal members. <br>  8. Immigrants can live in the country only on conditions of respect for the society that forms its basis, accepting the leading role of the culture of this society, language and morality in the state.  In fact, this relationship is based on the ‚Äúhost-guest‚Äù model: the guest respects the hosts, the hosts are hospitable and equally respect the guest. <br>  9. A visitor may become citizen of a country by a court decision and only if the basic principles of culture, morality and traditions of the society that forms the basis of the state are adopted. <br><br>  And now in more detail on each of the aspects of the functioning of the state, society and citizens. <br><br>  <b>Rights, obligations, freedoms, responsibility</b> <br><br>  The basis of any government is people and society, their interrelations.  Every member of the community has the rights provided by the society, which are closely connected with the duties of a person to society.  For example, a police officer has more rights in society, because he has more responsibilities, because he voluntarily risks his life, ensuring law and order in a particular region of the state.  Also, any member of the community has the freedoms provided by society, firmly attached to the responsibility imposed by society for the application of these freedoms.  For example, business freedom is tied to the responsibility to ensure that in the process of pursuing profit business does not cause damage to the entire society as a whole, as happened during the times of, for example, the Great Depression.  If during the implementation of a freedom a subject cannot bear full responsibility for it, it means that society will control this type of activity in order to minimize or stop all possible damage.  Since the scope of a person‚Äôs responsibilities and obligations to society is limited, the scope of rights and freedoms is also limited.  A specific set of rights and obligations, freedoms and responsibilities is the subject of a social contract and needs constant fine-tuning for current economic, political and social realities.  A member of society, voluntarily accepting a particular role, accepts that set of rights and obligations, freedoms and responsibilities imposed by society.  Setting the basic parameters of rights and obligations, freedoms and responsibilities is the subject of a social contract, but their specific adjustment and performance control is the role of the state. <br><br>  <b>State authorities</b> <br><br>  For the entire social contract system, it is very important to monitor its execution and constant adjustment to changing realities.  Because of the need to maximize the protection of active participants in economic activity, it is necessary to make it as difficult as possible to force the transfer of their investment to the wrong hands.  Therefore, it is necessary to have a system of several independent branches of government that impedes conspiracy to seize property from the subject of economic relations.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">To fill the branches of power with responsible and professionally trained people, and elections serve. The authorities are aimed at the benefit of the whole society, their interaction is based on competition and cooperation. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At the moment, all the highest bodies of the judicial system are illegitimate from the point of view of democracy, the society is imposed on judges who are endowed with power by means of collusion. Therefore, members of the country's highest judicial body should be elected by secret, verifiable voting by all members of society who have a law degree and have the right to vote. </font></font><br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Possible options for giving citizens the right to vote</font></font><br></b> <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> The following options are possible for forming a composition of citizens entitled to vote: </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A. Based on formal characteristics</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">1. Based on the age of a citizen, as well as the absence of a court decision imposing restrictions on the right to vote (the so-called universal suffrage). </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">2. Based on the positive balance of the citizen's contribution to the public good (the amount of taxes paid exceeds the amount of benefits received), as well as the absence of a court decision imposing restrictions on the right to vote. In this case, it is possible and proportional endowment - the more taxes paid, the more votes you can cast in elections. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">3. Based on the ownership of real estate, as well as the lack of a court decision imposing restrictions on the right to elect. In this case, it is possible and proportional endowment - the more there is real estate in the property, the more votes can be submitted at the elections.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">4. On the basis of the passage by the citizen of a socially significant service, enshrined in a social contract, as well as the absence of a judicial decision imposing restrictions on the right to elect (a partial example is a technocracy). </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">B. On the basis of informal signs </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">1. On the basis of passing the specialized open judicial examination for the right to vote, valid for a certain amount of time. The essence of the exam is to make sure that the applicant is loyal to society, aware of the social and political realities of the current reality, and also mentally adequate. The criteria on the basis of which the verdict is rendered, as well as the period for which the citizen is given the right to vote, must be subject to a social contract.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">2. Based on the abilities and talents of each individual citizen, as well as the absence of a court decision imposing restrictions on the right to elect (meritocracy). Criteria and mathematical weights for increasing the number of votes available to a citizen in elections are accepted on the basis of a social contract. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Each of the proposed options has its advantages and disadvantages. The choice of a specific way of giving citizens the right to vote is the subject of a social contract. </font></font><br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">State, Society and Personality</font></font></b> <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Personalities form a team and, as a result, a team forms individuals. These are inevitable processes due to the social structure of people. People are divided into collectivists and individualists. Most collectivists strive to obtain the most comfortable position within a congenial team. Most individualists seek freedom from the power of any collective. At the same time, there are far fewer individualists than collectivists; therefore, any society can be represented as a set of groups and collectivist communities, diluted by a small number of individualists. The formation of a collective takes place according to the principle of similarity of views on the world (ideological clan) or according to a territorial principle (territorial clan),the adjustment of people to the views of the team takes place due to the ‚Äútake the opinion of the majority and authorities‚Äù social program built into the majority of people, ‚Äúdo not stand out‚Äù. This leads to the fact that new socially significant ideas are usually expressed by asocial people, individualists who are not subject to the influence of society; these ideas are accepted by social people, collectivists, after which a new ideological clan is being formed, in which the initial ideas are brought to a state of ideological completion. The new clan enters the processes of competition and cooperation with other clans. There should be no individuals and clans that totally prevail over others - this leads to a weakening of the internal processes of competition and cooperation.that new socially significant ideas are usually expressed by asocial people, individualists, who are not influenced by society; these ideas are accepted by social people, collectivists, after which a new ideological clan is being formed, in which the initial ideas are brought to a state of ideological completion.

In return, citizens are obliged to pay taxes and law-abiding. And therefore, any citizen who is recognized in a court of law wishing to kill the state should automatically lose his citizenship.</font></font><br><br>     XIX-XX , , ,  ¬´ ¬ª,     ,    -   .             homo sapience  , ,   .        , ,     ()        ,   ,      .   ,      ,   ,     ,             .      ,    .        .        ,   ,      ,        .      ¬´¬ª   ¬´¬ª, ¬´¬ª‚Äì   ,      , ¬´¬ª  ¬´¬ª,                . <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The right to private property, as well as a set of measures aimed at the realization of this right, is the basis of the economy and social mechanisms of society. But since every right is accompanied by a duty, the owner of private property is obliged to protect the objects that are in his possession, reducing the public protection costs. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Freedom of entrepreneurship is a guarantee of health of the state economy. And because society must fully support private initiative, while ensuring both the right to success and the right to failure.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The percentage of people working for the state and state-owned companies should be limited by social contract. This will inevitably lead to an increase in the efficiency of the work of the internal government and administration in the country, as well as the predominance of the private sector of the economy over the state.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In any society, it is necessary to have a management system for its individual members. There are two mechanisms for this: culture and law and order. The first one regulates the members of the society ‚Äúgently‚Äù, uniting people in a single language, culture, and morality. The second acts more rigidly, forcing violators to account for their actions to society. Two types of penalties are used as defensive mechanisms against violators: discrimination and violence. Since both types of penalties are very effective, the state seeks to monopolize them, not encouraging the interpersonal use of these mechanisms. However, discrimination is possible solely on the basis of scientifically proven facts. For example, as a clearly discriminatory measure, it is necessary to prohibit women from working in enterprises, especially the production cycle that can irreversibly harm ovules,as a result, the future child may suffer. A man is quite capable of working at such enterprises due to differences in the functioning of the reproductive system. The system of violence is built around the protection of society in general and its individual members in particular, and is governed by current legislation.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The system of responsibility for crimes before society has in its essence the task not so much of punishment for the offense committed, as the prevention of an act that violates the law. The degree of responsibility for crimes must fully correspond to the severity of the consequences. Since often the consequences of collective crimes are much more significant than the crimes of singles, then the punishment must be stronger. At the same time, a stable group of people is a collective person, which means that the punishment for crimes committed by such a community should concern, in one form or another, all its members.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Chauvinism in all its forms is destructive to society. The rapid degradation of any communities built on the principles of total supremacy ‚Äî national, racial, religious ‚Äî we can observe with numerous examples from history. Also, these ideologies inevitably lead to wars and genocide, numerous murders of dissidents. Therefore, all ideologies based on the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãtotal superiority of some groups of people over others, as well as propaganda of such ideas, should be prohibited.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">When making decisions, state authorities should take into account not only the requests of citizens and certain groups of the population, but also the interests of the majority of society members who have the right to vote. In the event of a conflict of interest and failure to conclude a compromise agreement, the decision should be made on the basis of a scientific approach in favor of the long-term benefit of the majority of society members who have the right to vote, since it is the basis of the state within a democracy.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Government decision making and reporting for them should be as transparent as possible to citizens, with the exception of information, the disclosure of which could jeopardize the security of individual citizens and the country as a whole. This is due to horizontal relations between the state and citizens: since the state has great control over citizens and their personal information, then citizens must have great control over the state, its internal information and decisions. </font></font><br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Basics of the New World</font></font></b> <br><br>      ,     ,      ,   ,  ¬´ ¬ª.        ,      ,    ,      . -     ,     .  ,     ‚Äì    ,   ,   .        , , ,     ¬´      ,      , ,    ,       ¬ª. <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The basis of the scientific world is the principle of the value of rational education and the fullness of knowledge. Irrational beliefs can be valuable for specific people, but not for society as a whole, since all people are different and cannot believe in the same thing all at once. Society as a whole needs to defend itself against the irrational, but at the same time letting its members believe in what they themselves deem necessary. Also, it is the completeness of knowledge that allows a person to really understand a particular issue, which extremely helps not to get confused and not to be confused by strong manipulators and demagogues.</font></font><br><br>   50         ,     XX ,      , ,         .    ,     ¬´  ¬ª, ¬´  ,  ¬ª   ,     .            .  ‚Äì       ,               . <br><br> <b> , ,  </b> <br><br>      ,      .     ,       ,            ,            .   ,  ,         ,      ,    ,  .                ,   .     ‚Äì   ,         ,            ,     .      ,   ,        ,    .  ,            ,  ,   ,         .        . <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">An immigrant can come to the country only on the basis of the ‚Äúhost - guest‚Äù model, when a visitor from another country shows respect for the indigenous population, its culture, morals and traditions, and the host society shows equal respect and hospitality. They can be transferred to the status of a citizen of a country by an immigrant by a court decision and only if they fully accept the basic cultural and moral values ‚Äã‚Äãof the society in which the visitor integrates.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Free competition and cooperation between cultures and economies of different countries is what we call ‚Äúprogress‚Äù. In the conditions of monoculture and mono-economic system, as the sad experience of the USSR has shown, progress freezes, economy and culture begin to deteriorate. And as in any competition, there are economies more adequate reality and less, more efficient and less. All people are very different, all cultures are very different, because the efficiency of economies based on different cultures is different. Those that are more effective are more valuable to the whole world than others, for they show the rest ‚Äúas it should,‚Äù while others show, rather, ‚Äúas it should not.‚Äù And ‚Äúas it should be‚Äù is more valuable for all mankind, because it provides an example for imitation, and therefore, strengthening the competitive struggle and accelerating progress.</font></font><br><br>  <b>Conclusion</b> <br><br>  ,          -      ,     ,  ,     .  ,         ¬´ ¬ª,  ,             .             .          , , ,      ,    , , -  ,   ¬´¬ª   ¬´ ¬ª. ,        ¬´¬ª, ¬´¬ª, ¬´¬ª, ¬´¬ª, .        ,      , ,  ,          ¬´ ¬ª  ,  , ,  .   ¬´¬ª    ¬´¬ª    , ,   ,                -.  ¬´-¬ª XIX-XX ,       ‚Äì  ,     ¬´¬ª. ,   ¬´¬ª   ,      XVII-XX ,    ,  ,     ,  ,   ,      ,        ,  . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/391585/">https://habr.com/ru/post/391585/</a></p>
