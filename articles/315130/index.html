  <section class="page js-page"><h1>About slaves, heroes and hero slaves</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> On Habr√© there is a fairly large number of articles on the topic ‚Äúhow to motivate yourself / staff correctly‚Äù.  In this case, as a rule, it is implicitly assumed that all people are more or less the same and the methods work, if not for everyone.  then for most.  In my opinion, this is a fundamentally erroneous approach, and without a preliminary assessment of ‚Äúwho are we actually motivating?‚Äù, The question does not make any sense at all. <br><br>  I propose my own way of dividing people into types (types / classes / varieties) of ‚Äúdependence of performance on motivation‚Äù: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8e7/992/30f/8e799230fdcd48089b329f2eb0a5ff46"><br>  <i>In the chart is my personal Picture of the World, possessing for me a decent predictive power.</i> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  It does not depict the motivation for something specific at any given time, but how people can react to this type of motivation.  Each person on this chart is a separate, inactive point.  I think it is innate.  Well, or recorded with the "self-awareness of personality" in early childhood.  Further, a person so in this place ‚Äúin life‚Äù goes and moves him from there only by a very strong change in external conditions - and even then he has a pair of ‚Äúmagnetic‚Äù state points that cannot be identified or determined in advance (for example, a person got into captivity).  Mass inhuman experiments in the form of wars and all kinds of ‚Äúand not quite‚Äù (~ from Belomorkanal to Treblinka) gave rich material on this subject - even there a person remains himself within rather narrow limits of what is actually possible.

      But I am talking, after all, about the "ordinary peaceful life." <br><br>  ‚ÄúPositive motivation‚Äù is all sorts of reinforcements ‚Äúwe will do and (then) be good.‚Äù <br>  ‚ÄúNegative motivation‚Äù is a stick (which is ‚Äúnot a carrot‚Äù).  From ‚Äúshout‚Äù - until execution. <br>  And then according to the schedule on the left - to the right: <br><br>  ‚ÄúZ / c.‚Äù In the sense of ‚Äúconvicts‚Äù on the downwardly threatening branch threat ‚Äî the less they are forced into, the better they work.  Just because the discharge depletes and so their powerful forces.  I'm here about the extreme case of hard labor, and not about imitation itself.  This section is not interesting to me.  Well, the questions of their intra-social clashes, perhaps, will not be studied. <br><br>  "Prisoners" have a goal to survive, to live, to return.  This is their motivation.  Also negative - ‚Äúavoid the worst.‚Äù  The half-union was rebuilt by them, half of the world was conquered (I‚Äôm talking about antiquity) - to a little toughening / loosening, their productivity is invariant.  Shelf graphics in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe local maximum efficiency, somewhere here smoothly flowing into the "slaves".  (prisoners - not really slaves, although there are no clear boundaries). <br><br>  Once again, the schedule to scroll less: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/860/277/467/86027746738d456fb1799b2a273292fd"><br>  <i>(the motivations below are conditional and are not the subject of this discussion)</i> <br><br>  Slaves are mute.  Slaves - work.  On slaves, in fact, Humanity became Civilization, rising from "just tribes."  Slave labor of a ready-made adult is super efficient.  Even in our time, whatever the philosophers and historians say to us.  If only because it relieves the problems of reproduction of such / these people outside - in space or time.  While and where there is a (permanent) source of ‚Äúready-made people‚Äù for slave labor, it will be.  The difficult question is local in time and place of slavery in underground and not very modern factories, from Moscow region to mainland China: we take ‚Äúfrom the outside‚Äù ready-made people, exploit it as much as possible, throw off the skin again outside.  Prisons and armies around the world are also massively practiced. <br><br>  Dependence on "demanding" almost linear.  The taskmaster beats - they work, the taskmaster is tired - they sleep for the future. <br><br>  Working slaves closely adjoin the slaves, both in the biological sense (physical bulls and horses) and in the vulgar-allegorical - those who, forgive the term, but more precisely, I find it difficult to define - in common parlance "bydlo".  Those who work under the lash.  It is their definition and self-determination, not a property or a feature.  If a person works only under the lash - he defined himself.  And ‚Äúthey beat us, and we grow stronger‚Äù - this is also about them, although they don‚Äôt like it very much, they can't even eat.  Karma-Sansara they have such.  If the ‚Äúbulls‚Äù are not beaten ‚Äúfor the result‚Äù, but simply out of their natural malice, the final result will be negative in all senses.  If you want to get the result from the ‚Äúbull‚Äù - keep it in the state of ‚Äúalmost a slave‚Äù.  It works.  The clause "almost" - that would give the opportunity to "change the fate of" passionaries.  Segregation of the circles of hell should be voluntary, without this the Empire can not be built - neither the Island, nor financial. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/203/c75/32b/203c7532be7946b3a416b7f3b1605753.jpg"><br><br>  Hackers and bridesmaids have ruined the Soviet Union.  It is not clear what to do with them - they mow, drive a marriage, transfer material assets, time and work of other people to waste, regardless of punishment and rewards.  Not even because the hands are crooked, but because "all the same."  It can not be redone.  Bracelet maker "is not needed" (in the household) from the word at all.  Branding at the company - a marriage of HR and bosses.  Shoal.  Mistake.  Errors need to be corrected - get rid of the maker.  For example, compulsory transfer it to "cattle", if for some reason you can not part. <br><br>  Bracelet maker in decision makers (decision makers) - skiff office.  The absence of such a ‚Äúforced elevator down‚Äù for the proletarian-marketer in the state of the supposedly victorious dictatorship cost us all of us once.  A hundred years ago, the absence of such an elevator for a bridal master, from small ‚Äúclerks‚Äù everywhere to the most important one, was even more expensive ... (This is my personal opinion and holivar on this subject I don‚Äôt want to develop) <br><br>  "Pofigisty" strictly fulfill the necessary minimum.  Strictly wage, strictly within working hours.  Plus or minus in a wide range in the population, because their area on the graph is wide.  But for each person, this plus or minus, as a rule, is almost a constant in life.  They pull the strap.  They are well suited to external motivation, do not like punishments and try to avoid them by improving their quality.  But, going beyond the checkpoint, work is thrown out of my head.  Pofigisty - the basis of the productive forces of society since the invention of "wages" - the alienation of the results of labor from a person and the transition to payment of this labor in money.  "The problems of the employee's company do not care."  If you are nihilists, but you are floated by the problems of the company - this is a sufficient sign of the presence of non-economic coercion.  This moment must be able to isolate and catch. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dca/49c/7c1/dca49c7c1fc94a208869c60d17418e2a.gif"><br><br>  Enthusiasts are not interested in me - these are those who really, really want, but cannot.  Because of this, they, as a rule, are few in number, because they do not live long after bursting at some nonsense. <br><br>  The long-living enthusiast is a snag, a fake, i.e.  enthusiast hack.  Their own effectiveness is negative, but harmless without external, by other people, gains - well, then they pull down and all that society, which strengthened it, than it will still withdraw itself. <br><br>  "Professionals" is an expensive and worthwhile product.  The peculiarity of a specialist is that the whole production chain should consist of them.  Even the lack of a front of work demotivates a specialist.  One brawler in the chain of specialists is a complete project. <br><br>  The effectiveness of a specialist above a certain level is limited by external reasons or his qualifications - this is not controlled by simple motivation.  <b>The specialist is motivated mainly by things external to the place of work</b> - work ethic, for example, his own education, interest, reputation, etc.  long-playing, I repeat things external to the "work".  The manager is only able to transfer the results of the specialist‚Äôs work a little back and forth in time, without a noticeable change in the long-term integral.  Somewhat unexpectedly, often for ‚Äúmotivational team leaders‚Äù is the complexity / impossibility to motivate a specialist to perform work / actions that hinder his own inner convictions or knowledge.  For example, it is very difficult to force a specialist to squeeze water in a mortar and wear it with a sieve (for other categories, this is very often an occurring activity, sometimes even the main, if not the only, activity).  More often than not, forcing him to do it can only be broken by him as a specialist, and since then he will be unsuitable in this capacity, turning into a lackey of ‚Äúwhat if you wish‚Äù and ‚Äúhack Rem Row Quadriga‚Äù. <br><br>  Approximately, offhand, the number: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bcc/253/56b/bcc25356b64c49b287cead0e75029ed7.jpg"><br><br>  I draw your attention that this number is not from income, but from ‚Äúmotivation to work in life‚Äù, and the notorious minimum wage is given here simply as a place where money is the main motivator and their influence is linear. <br><br>  If your income is in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe minimum wage and you are not nihilists, but rather a specialist, then you are most likely a Hero. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/171/7ff/35e/1717ff35ee784cc1a55b0294248a260b.jpg"><br><br>  Hero ... <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/edison/blog/314094/">Hero everyone wants</a> .  The fate of the hero is bright and tragic - he accomplishes the feat, tearing horizons or pulling everyone out of a deep, deep hole ... The whole history of Russia is a steady reproduction of Heroes.  And, perhaps, most of the civilization is the upbringing of a Hero who, if he exploits after the feat, then at best turns into a walking statue to himself.  The most typical character of the hero is Hercules. <br><br>  In general, the theme of the hero is extremely multifaceted and has a lot of completely sometimes unexpected intersections. <br><br>  For example  The classic ancient Greek hero was Jesus - the son of God and the mortal, who accomplished an absolutely unbearable mortal feat at the cost of his life ‚Äî he overthrew the pagan gods from Olympus. <br><br>  At the end of life, the Hero goes to the sky.  Our Gagarin rightfully stands in their row. <br><br>  The main problem with the Heroes is not in themselves, but in a society that gets used to them: you can jerk as you please, accumulate various kinds of debts ‚Äî monetary, environmental, technological, administrative ‚Äî spit ‚Äî the Hero will come and give us deliverance, will clear the Augean stables, wins Tugarin, abolishes serfdom and sedentary line, conducts reforms, replaces the master, the king and the rabid printer with the right smart and kind ones, fills the rivers with milk and fish, and forests with firewood and game, deactivates bad isotopes, cancels the gulag, restores the data  s nonexistent backups, throw all the weight and eliminate the AIDS and procrastination.  Moreover, these two of the casket (‚Äúnot gods - humans, attributable to labor‚Äù) will come to us, from the Murom swamps or Nazareth, and will do everything ‚Äúfor us‚Äù in both senses (and ‚Äúinstead‚Äù, and ‚Äúin our favor‚Äù ) - initiative, autonomously, independently without sparing your stomach.  And having done this, it is self-liquidating, so that, God forbid, you do not have to pay it off or answer uncomfortable questions.  For example, to prevent the like from now on ... <br><br>  Despite the seemingly utopian nature of such expectations - in the history of mankind and even ours, and even quite recent ones - this happened regularly - so regularly that the society was even corrupted by such behavior. <br><br>  So much so that even ceased to be concerned about their stable reproduction. <br><br>  At the same time, it must be remembered that the basis of the mass education of the population - at least in Russia for the last two hundred years (except for the last, about 30) - was entirely and entirely aimed at the education of heroes.  Moreover, at the same time - necessarily slaves who do not have their own opinion about the state of affairs in the field of their future exploits, what if the party orders - neither the time to the questions ‚Äúdo we need it?‚Äù Nor the right to ask questions ‚Äúwhat did they bring to such an ass? "- they didn't have ... <br><br>  The most interesting, in my opinion, is in this moment: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/42c/16b/dac/42c16bdacb7b44b4ab51cc320f9762bb.jpg"><br><br>  Namely - in the extraordinary efficiency of people who know that in any way they will not survive (or, which is the same thing, about the presence of free will of the hero).  Actually, this moment is ‚Äúa feat‚Äù (at the very edge of a decline, since a statistically significant hero dies at the beginning, having not yet accomplished the feat). <br><br>  Well, and - I have a big suspicion of the presence of this circuit: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/022/2bd/068/0222bd068fcf489bbbd40a463816541b"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/06e/f34/93c/06ef3493cbe9481ab430d9cdd0fdffee.jpg"><br><br>  After all, the hero, who works only not the result - in the process completely slaughters on the "trifles" of the type of food-health-safety and in general the instinct of self-preservation.  And in this place I would like to know the thoughts of the community. <br><br>  By the way, Hercules was a slave - and went to his exploits, as if softer - "not entirely voluntary."  This is important, it can be said even the key point why we have so much (technological) debt accumulated here - both the notorious ‚ÄúUS national debt‚Äù and radioactive waste (half a million tons over the planet are the integral of the divergence) and ‚Äúeducational debt‚Äù <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/233851/">with us.</a> <br><br>  This is all I need for - it seems to me, most of the personnel management systems - in terms of employee motivation, they are built somehow "across nature", in fact, stupid in the hope of selfless labor of the hero, who will pull everyone away, no matter what. <br><br>  Links, of course, no - look for "technographer". <br><br><hr><br>  As the opportunity opens, I‚Äôll add a poll ‚Äúwho do you consider yourself to be in life‚Äù. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/315130/">https://habr.com/ru/post/315130/</a></p>
