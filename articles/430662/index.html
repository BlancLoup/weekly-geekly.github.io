  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Monitoring Windows servers on pure MS SQL, and how I secretly implemented it</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Once, in a far-away galaxy, there was a firm that had long grown from a startup, but which still remained fairly compact and efficient.  The company has hosted (on its hardware) hundreds of Windows servers, and it was necessary to monitor this.  Even before I came to it, the NetIQ system was chosen as the solution. <br><br>  I was instructed to set up NetIQ, and the one who did it before me did not say a single word about it.  Printed  I soon realized why.  Steve Jobs probably turns in his grave, looking at a similar interface: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wv/cq/kj/wvcqkjtunh0raiwt14rvhpbn-pw.png" alt="image"></div><br>  In one line, the logic of the "bird" is positive (Raise event).  In another negative (Do not raise event).  How I work with ‚ÄúOnly raise events when‚Äù with a different set of checkmarks is only experimentally understood (and I have already forgotten). <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  However, NetIQ‚Äôs much worse feature was its fragility.  Her agent, which was installed on each server, was significantly more vulnerable than Windows itself.  Little memory?  Agent flew out.  CPU 100%?  Agent not responding.  There are 0 bytes left on the disk - what would you think?  To send a message, the agent must first form it on disk, as a file ... Well, you understand.

      Nevertheless, with this, we somehow lived until this company was bought by the company even more.  When a monster eats up a tiny company, this company dissolves like a drop in the ocean.  In our case, by ourselves, by IT standards, we were only slightly smaller than those who bought us, and it was immediately obvious that the merger process would be very difficult.  So complicated that for some time we were not touched at all and internally all processes remained the same.  This state was similar to the moment when the One Ring fell on the lava, but had not yet begun to melt: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qf/--/cy/qf--cyd5ehkjz_5zjhmogmwekcw.jpeg"></div><br>  In the meantime, I upgraded NetIQ from version 7 to 8 and further to 9, when our problems started.  NetIQ monitors only a few things: the availability of the server itself, memory, CPU, disk, and most importantly - services.  If our samopisny services were in ‚ÄúAutomatic‚Äù, then they had to work.  That this should not be: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/45/fz/1h/45fz1ho3t3mxx6ka8yjlhg-_yjs.jpeg"></div><br>  These events in most cases stopped monitoring NetIQ.  After a week of experiments and a week of working with support, we found out that ‚Äúthis is not a bug, this is a feature‚Äù and that an alert is created only with a certain exit code.  And our services sometimes fell with any codes. <br><br>  It took a lot of time and it was too late to roll back.  As you understand, finding that our critical infrastructure is not monitored, we immediately ... er, ... did nothing.  Because by this time, the ‚Äúdissolution‚Äù of our company in a large part entered the active phase, and it looked like this: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/cq/y3/zk/cqy3zk1iyhts4aijbhx0umtxab8.jpeg"></div><br>  Distant rumblings of thunder, screams, and lightning flew to me, and it looked so that the fate of the world was being decided, and I climbed with some petty technical problem ... And I could not sleep well, knowing that our monitoring was half blind. <br><br>  Realizing that there was nowhere to wait for help, I decided to quickly write a service scanner that would bypass all the servers and send a letter, if something went wrong, as NetIQ did.  You probably think I used Powershell?  Not.  If you have a hammer in your hands, then all around are nails, and if you are DBA and have worked with SQL since version 6.0, then ... A little excerpt from the code so that you understand what is at stake: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zt/bb/3h/ztbb3hzjroe6t_bzlsj1atrulbi.png"></div><br>  I did it in a few hours.  Over the next few days, an audit of messages, parameters and other goodies appeared.  After reading about the WMIC team, I could not stop.  Then a couple of weeks in a daze.  I woke up when everything that we used in NetIQ was rewritten and worked with a bang. <br><br>  The functionality was not just copied - I realized all my fantasies, everything that I would like from such a system.  LOWDISK - you also get a graph of how free disk space has behaved lately - is it normal growth or something went wrong.  Little memory - that's the graph, and the list of processes and how much they occupy, and for w3wp.exe we will also finish the name of the application pool, smart reminders and much more.  By the way, the system was able to independently take a list of servers from VMware.  One quick glance at the subjects of the alerts in the telephone was enough to understand what was going on: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ps/cq/fk/pscqfkh5qb23_oujl6zyjmeexzy.png"></div><br>  Modern programmers are so accustomed to thinking abstractly that they cannot write a monitoring system other than ‚Äúwe run a set of abstract monitoring scripts for the server, and we don‚Äôt care what is inside‚Äù, while monitoring each state ‚Äî disk, memory, CPU, services ‚Äî in its own way. are unique.  Implementing this "abstract", you do the same poorly for each case, and this is what happens: (This is a screenshot from the email from SCOM. Surely done strictly according to the TOR) <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wm/3m/ut/wm3mutentcltlmpobwyjutqm0me.png"></div><br>  The great advantage of the new system was that it was agentless, respectively, there were no problems with the installation of the agent, its downfalls - there simply was nothing to fall.  The system was simple and reliable as a hammer. <br><br>  The next few months I came to work in the morning, stood in front of my brainchild, like an artist in front of a canvas and put a couple of strokes, making it even more perfect.  Since I didn't have any deadlines, technical debt was kept to a minimum.  At some point, I still forced myself to stop. <br><br>  NetIQ was still working, but everyone liked the new type of alerts, and gradually I switched everyone to alerts from the new system, without turning off, however, the old one.  In the meantime, the ‚Äúmeltdown‚Äù process has entered its final stage: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/8j/sy/da/8jsydazfbheft25w9ugymimk_hi.jpeg"></div><br>  Well, the tale was supposed to end.  I myself was surprised that I could have so much fun in a large bureaucratic company.  After a month of preparation, I was told that after a week everything, we extinguish NetIQ, we are switching to SCOM.  I turned off NetIQ (I confess, I hated him so much that I was very pleased) and waited for SCOM.  But at the appointed time he was not.  It was not a week later, and a month later. <br><br>  SCOM appeared only after six months - someone forgot how many servers we have and how many licenses are needed for SCOM.  For six months, so many systems began to depend on my system, which began to lead and inventory, metrics, and much more, which quietly remained the second - unofficial.  For auditors, there is SCOM, and everything that is really useful is in the second system. <br><br>  Sometimes managers at different levels wondered - where did these automated emails go from?  Recently, I described a story to them in detail, which I set out in this article, and they laughed merrily.  Although I still sometimes have the most fun, as in a big bureaucratic company, one can sneak a lot of things with ‚Äúsly‚Äù.  And it's nice to just pee the code, like in the good old days. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/430662/">https://habr.com/ru/post/430662/</a></p>
