In my opinion, you cannot force yourself - you can only agree with yourself.  Well, or deceive - but this is not the best way. <br>  So, how do you agree to do something with yourself that you clearly don‚Äôt want to do?  And just as clearly necessary. <br>  Some time ago I read in the psychologist <a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/heidi-grant-halvorson/">Heidi Halvorson</a> 's blog about three simple reasons that prevent us from doing something, and the same (well, almost) simple solutions to these problems.  And since time has shown that solutions (at least to me) are suitable, I hasten to share them. <br><br>  So, why is the deadline approaching, but there is still no solution? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Reason # 1: You are postponing the case because you are afraid of not coping with it.</b> <br><br>  Solution: instead of ‚Äúfixing on achievements‚Äù use ‚Äúfixing on loss prevention‚Äù.

      Explanation: each task can be viewed from two points of view.  It is usually accepted to look like this - "I will do it, and I will become better / cooler / richer / healthier."  This is a ‚Äúfixation on achievement‚Äù when you anticipate how you will be better off when you achieve something.  The problem is that if you are afraid of not coping with the task, its implementation does not make sense - you will not achieve anything.  If you want, for example, to go in for sports, and subconsciously imagine the great sporting achievements that are coming for you - you are also afraid not to reach them. <br>  Psychological studies show that one of the most common reasons for postponing tasks is precisely to be afraid of not doing it. <br><br>  But you can look at the problem from the other side: what happens if it is not done?  Surely you will lose something.  If you don‚Äôt do your job, you will lose your salary, or maybe a bonus.  It is not necessary to get a gold medal at the Olympiad - but if you don‚Äôt play sports at all, you will undermine your health.  Set yourself up for ‚Äúloss prevention‚Äù and this will be a good motivator. <br><br>  Of course, this is not so easy and simple, but it is better to motivate yourself in such a way than to worry about what can go wrong, and as a result do nothing. <br><br>  <b>Reason # 2: You postpone the task because you are ‚Äúnot in the mood‚Äù.</b> <br><br>  Solution: ignore your feelings and moods, they only bother you. <br><br>  "I just can not get up early," "I can not go to the gym" - such excuses are too often used.  But in fact, no one chained you to the bed.  Before entering the fitness club you are not blocked by the bouncers.  Physically, nothing prevents you - you simply "have no suitable mood."  Ok, and who said that in order to do something, you must have the right mood? <br><br>  Think about it.  For some reason, it is believed that to achieve success, you must necessarily have an inspiration or mood.  We must be determined to do what needs to be done.  Is this not nonsense?  In general, of course, you need to more or less want something - to become healthier, richer, stronger.  But you do not need to experience the right mood all the time. <br><br>  All successful people of creative professions - artists, writers (and many programmers also like to identify themselves as creative people) - they all achieved success by simply working a few hours a day.  Regardless of the mood.  As <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Close">Chuck Close</a> (an artist and photographer who continued to work even after partial body paralysis) said: ‚ÄúInspiration is for newcomers.  Everyone else just comes and works. ‚Äù <br><br>  So, if you are not in the mood - this is no reason.  Nothing stops you. <br><br>  <b>Reason # 3: The task is too complicated, boring or unpleasant.</b> <br><br>  Solution: plan its execution in advance. <br><br>  As soon as it comes time to do something very difficult, unpleasant - and doubts come.  ‚ÄúOr maybe I will do it next time.  Or maybe it's not so necessary.  And now there is something else to do. ‚Äù <br><br>  The problem is that if you start thinking about, doing or not doing something, when it's time to do it - you set yourself a double task.  And decide on this, and then more and do it.  And decision making is a difficult task in itself.  It is necessary to include willpower every time - and, as you know, it is not iron. <br><br>  It is much easier to make planning based on a simple if / sometime algorithm.  "When Saturday comes, I will tidy up the apartment."  "When I got up in the morning, I immediately do the exercises."  "If the boss forgets about my request to raise my salary, I will remind him at the meeting." <br><br>  Making decisions in advance, you are already doing some of the work.  It remains when the right moment comes, just to fulfill your decision.  You have already decided - well, there is no room for doubts. <br><br>  From myself I want to add one more trick that I use.  Usually, a person is not lazy to just do something - usually you do not want to change the state, or switch to another task.  I know that when I started doing something, it‚Äôs just much easier to continue.  Therefore, every time I encounter an unpleasant or difficult task, I negotiate with myself - if I suddenly don‚Äôt want to continue it, I‚Äôll finish right there.  "Here I will begin to clean up the apartment from this room - if I suddenly throw something." <br>  Almost always, as a result, the task is brought to the end - ‚ÄúI have already begun, what to throw halfway through.‚Äù <br><br>  And finally, I note that if you wake up in the morning, you smile with anticipation of what you will do all day, if time passes unnoticed behind your work, if you are surprised that only a month has passed, and you have already done so much - congratulations, you are happy person! <br><br>  Good luck to you in all your endeavors, and may the will power be with you. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/214113/">https://habr.com/ru/post/214113/</a></p>
