  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Samsung Galaxy i7500 - Five Months Later</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I am very glad that the company Samsung <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/samsung/blog/83464/">came</a> to Habr.  And I am sure that they will be interested to know the user's opinion about their product.  Anyone who is going to buy a "google" of this company, I advise you to read. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/889/c79/b0f/889c79b0f0dfd276fc0e5d2726f5fdff.jpg"><br><br>  To begin with, the Samsung Galaxy i7500 is really a great <i>piece of hardware</i> .  The main competitor at the time of release was the HTC Hero;  while Hero is thicker by a millimeter, and it does not have a flash and 8 gigabytes of internal memory.  Yes, maybe the i7500 is not the best touchscreen, but you can live with it.

And since then, my attitude towards Android, as a platform, has not deteriorated at all.  There are some rough edges, but they are easy to overcome. <br><br>  But the trouble has crept up from an unexpected side: Samsung's firmware does not allow to fully use the phone.  The unlock phone bug returns from time to time, the battery very quickly sits down, and this is despite the AMOLED screen, which in theory consumes less energy.  Worse, updates are rarely released, and the company practically does not listen to user feedback. <br><br>  In the latest official firmware, sometimes <a href="http://androidforums.com/samsung-i7500/9505-dialpad-doesnt-work-during-call.html">entering numbers during a call does not work</a> .  They say that the problem does not appear at all. <br><br>  But everyone has a problem with mp3: only id3v1 tags are displayed (and only Latin);  You can forget about music with Russian tags.  It is noteworthy that there were at least two appeals to the Russian-speaking support of the company.  Happy owners of phones offered to fill tags in Latin (!).  The next time, sweet girl Elena reported that she had never heard of the problem, and she would definitely inform the engineer.  It was last year, but, naturally, no reaction followed.  ( <a href="http://androidforums.com/samsung-i7500/28067-id3v2-mp3-tags.html">1</a> , <a href="http://4pda.ru/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D120161%26st%3D900%26p%3D3610977">2</a> , <a href="http://androidforums.ru/Pri-kopirovanii-muzyki-na-smart---ona-vsya-peremeshalas-t2242.html">3</a> , <a href="http://forum.androidfan.ru/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D641">4</a> ).  I even tried to contact <a href="https://geektimes.ru/users/lamo4ok/" class="user_link">lamo4ok</a> , but traditionally did not receive an answer. <br><br>  Now let's talk about updates.  While Motorola releases 2.1 in the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/motorola%3Fv%3Dfeed%26story_fbid%3D294428153158%26ref%3Dmf">coming weeks</a> ;  while HTC is going <a href="http://www.htcsource.com/2010/01/htc-hero-android-2-1-update-scheduled-for-march/">to release 2.1 in March</a> , Samsung announces that 1.6 could be released in March;  and, it seems, even refutes the rumor that appeared as a result of confusion, that it will release 2.1. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d57/0d8/5f8/d570d85f84cc8858bc6f27ac6e0caec3.png" align="right"><br><br>  It is not surprising that this behavior of the company causes discontent among users.  A typical <a href="http://androidforums.com/samsung-i7500/22877-samsung-will-never-again-see-me-pay-one-their-phones.html">message</a> from the forum: "I will never buy a phone from Samsung again." <br><br>  All this led to the appearance of as many as three unofficial firmware for the phone. <br><br><h2>  Galaxhero </h2><br>  <a href="http://forum.hdblog.it/showthread.php%3Fp%3D33777">forum.hdblog.it/showthread.php?p=33777</a> <br><br>  The most stable of the currently existing unofficial firmware.  It is based on the official, but partially changed: another kernel, 5 desktops, skin, as in Hero, vpn, dynamic DNS, telnet and more.  Somewhere she manages to be even faster than official.  But problems still sometimes arise: programs hang, the phone reboots.  Although in principle, you can live with it. <br><br><h2>  mustymod </h2><br>  <a href="http://mustymod.wordpress.com/">mustymod.wordpress.com</a> <br><br>  At one of the forums there was a rather long post that Samsung will not have version 2.0 on the Galaxy until Samsung releases it (this is because the code responsible for managing the GSM modem is closed and its reverse engineering is complicated).  Oddly enough, a mysterious man from Turkey has recently appeared with the nickname mustymod, who released an almost working version 2.0.  He even partially opened the source code.  But the firmware is still cheese: handsfree, camera, bluetooth, 3d does not work.  Synchronization is not working well.  And they <a href="http://androidforums.com/samsung-i7500/40806-how-mustymod.html">say</a> that sometimes the firmware from mustymod can ruin your Google account.  In general, in the future something may come out of this, but for the time being it cannot be used. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/603/a87/7ce/603a877cedec668a7c988e2a01b5c5a8.jpg" align="right"><br><br><h2>  gaosp </h2><br>  <a href="http://code.google.com/p/gaosp/">code.google.com/p/gaosp</a> <br><br>  Attempting to port Android 2.1 source code to Galaxy.  Currently under active development.  Even bug reports are not advised to write.  Given the fact that mustymod has opened the source, it is hoped that the joint efforts can give some positive results. <br><br><h2>  Instead of conclusion </h2><br>  Personally, I am ready not to listen to music with Russian tags on the phone, not to use Google navigation and animated wallpaper.  I'm used to the poor performance of Bluetooth and use the speakerphone.  I have three charges: one at home, one at work, and another one I carry with me in case I have to linger in the evening. <br><br>  But if you want to buy a Galaxy or Spica, then keep in mind that despite the good quality of the devices themselves, Samsung does not follow the firmware at all.  So if you want to not only get a ‚Äúgoogle phone‚Äù, but also receive updates, then consider whether or not you should buy a phone from another manufacturer. <br><br>  PS In the pictures: a) official firmware b) GalaxHero c) firmware from mustymod. <br><br>  <b>UPD</b> : There is a <a href="http://www.petitionspot.com/petitions/samsunggalaxy">petit</a> calling Samsung to pay attention to the Galaxy and update the firmware.  I have never seen these petitions work, but I signed just in case. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/83507/">https://habr.com/ru/post/83507/</a></p>
