  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The story of one unsuccessful hacking</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I‚Äôve got used to the fact that a lot of spam comes to my mail, which is already about seven years old, from the most distant relatives from distant countries who bequeath me millions of money to banal offers to increase everything and everything and immediately put it into practice.  I treat spam even a little positive: you open the mail, and there are a lot of letters, and you open it like lottery tickets - what's the matter and what to throw out. <br><br>  But a couple of weeks ago, one by one, letters from a disgruntled ‚ÄúMail.ru administration‚Äù began to pour in, that supposedly my mail account was sending spam and I was not a good person.  The first letter was even a little surprised, as it was similar in style and format to messages from this administration.  Needless to say, the letters were fictitious, and the links on which it was suggested to go were fake and led to sites to steal passwords. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      Having received a couple of such letters, I warned all the female and senior parts of my relatives and acquaintances, showed bad letters and explained why we should not pay attention to them and that the real administration of the site would never require you to enter your login and password.  They all left, but they said that no one had received such letters. <br>  Well, okay, I thought, but soon I received an email with the headline "Re: hacked!" And the following content: <br><br>  <i>Please send me a screen image of the page with letters in your inbox.</i>  <i>I can also write a letter with this mail as sender</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>----- Original Message -----</i> <i><br></i>  <i>From: &lt;dsbav@mail.ru&gt;</i> <i><br></i>  <i>To: 5551777@mail.ru</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Date: Thu, Jan 28, 2010 10:24:27 +0300 (MSK)</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Subject: Hacked!</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>&gt; Hello, you ordered a hack of this mail from which I am writing to you ... to get a password, write to nethack07@gmail.com</i> <br><br>  Here dsbav@mail.ru is the address of my mail (changed the real address to a similar one. The real address consists of the same characters and represents the same nonsense and has no meaning).  In addition to my address, I send the letter 1 to 1 as is. <br><br>  It immediately became clear why I was so generously showered with letters inviting me to give my password.  Someone ordered someone to hack my mailbox, which in itself was unpleasant.  I could hardly imagine what the attackers needed my mail for, as there was nothing super interesting on her: ICQ, hosting, a couple of domains and an account on a torrent.ru with a one-person rating - the most interesting thing you can get from it.  Of course, it became very interesting what kind of people they were, and I began to search online for people by mailing addresses. <br><br>  The search for a friend at 5551777@mail.ru yielded no results, but nethack07@gmail.com, as it turned out, is an experienced hacker.  First, this "hacker" elicits a password through phishing letters, and when it does not work out, it simply sends the letter, substituting mail that should have been hacked into the sender's address.  That is, if out of two people (the owner of the mail or the customer), at least one is inattentive or just a simpleton, the hacker gets his money. <br><br>  Here and there the customer turned out to be a dummy, although mistrustful.  Having received a letter from my mailbox, he doubted and asked for a screenshot of the incoming messages.  Just sent a letter not to the hacker, but to me, by simply pressing the answer button.  At this point, it was a sin not to take a moment to find out the reason for the hacking of my mail, which I actually did.  I registered 2 email accounts: 5511777@mail.ru and nethack07@mail.com, which at first glance resemble the real addresses of intruders.  I decided to use almost their own methods in general.  And he wrote 2 letters: to the hacking customer and the contractor.  Everything is banal with the performer - he didn‚Äôt even answer, apparently immediately cutting through the whole situation (although the next day there came another 2 letters inviting me to enter my login and password somewhere).  But the customer immediately responded, because I attached a screenshot of incoming messages to the letter.  I asked him to double-check everything again and write the wallet number.  What I did, sticking another screenshot.  The next day, 1000 rubles appeared in my wallet.  Here it turns out how much it costs to break a mailbox on mail.ru ... The customer wrote 3 letters, threatening that if I deceive him, he would write a complaint to Webmoney arbitration.  Very funny! <br><br>  He explained to the person that he had already been talking for some time not with the hacker, but with the mail master, offered to return him the money if he explained why he needed my mail.  In response, I received a "nickname from me."  In general, I didn‚Äôt want to continue talking with this character.  My mail is, frankly, a disorderly collection of letters, for I registered it just for registration in all forums, but as a result I began to use it as the main one.  In addition, this login is free on the domains list.ru, bk.ru, etc.  We assume that they have taught a bad careless customer a bad deed, and a nedohaker.  And some time will spend the money on the wallet in case a person apologizes and still explains why he started all this, and if the miracle does not happen, I will give it somewhere where it will be really useful, because there is no desire to use it. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/83611/">https://habr.com/ru/post/83611/</a></p>
