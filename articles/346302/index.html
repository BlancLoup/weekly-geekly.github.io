  <section class="page js-page"><h1>IT 2018: the future came yesterday</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  We have almost written a post for the old New Year with a great idea and heroes of Russian fairy tales, but the process was interrupted by a message in the Telegram.  And in it - the announcement of news from market experts.  Researchers from Oxford and Yale universities came to the conclusion that the transition to full automation of most economic and technological processes will end in 150 years.  Their Asian colleagues show a more optimistic term - 104 years. <br><br>  So all the fantasies of companies regarding the victory of artificial intelligence for a couple of years, alas (or fortunately), are untenable.  Nevertheless, technology continues to expand, experts predict the future, business accepts or changes the rules of the game.  We have our own forecast.  And you - share your comments.  Well, fairy tales, perhaps, leave - they predicted the future hundreds of years ago. <br><br> <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/lanit/blog/346302/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6d5/5fb/0ca/6d55fb0ca256ad44ca7fb247f8c96f8c.jpg"></a> <br>  <a href="http://www.lumiere-mag.ru/robert-zemekis-nazad-v-budushhee-recenziya/"><i>A source</i></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In our time, the forecast even for five years looks like a complete madness - all components of the surrounding reality change so quickly: from technology and consumer preferences to foreign economic and political background.  GK LANIT in the IT field for 28 years, and during this time we have repeatedly turned out to be visionaries, introducing promising technologies and the first to bring solutions to the market.  Today we will talk about our new 2018: what it will bring to business and, most importantly, to programmers, graduates and employees of companies.

    <h2>  Major trends that will continue to change life </h2><br><h3>  IoT Internet of Things - sensors and data </h3><br>  It is customary to consider the Internet of Things as a set of devices that transmit information, which is then processed by information and analytical systems.  Someone perceives IoT as the first step to chipping people on the screen, someone only treats it as entertainment, someone predicts an explosive growth in the number of various sensors, both in private and in production. <br><br>  Banks, like trading, are still suspicious of IoT due to the lack of standards for protecting such networks.  A pioneer in the use of IoT steel utilities (in Russia and the CIS have global projects to collect data on energy consumption), automotive concerns, companies and warehouses. <br><br>  Undoubtedly, IoT will develop.  Now mobile operators launch special networks to connect such devices to the Internet.  And it will only be necessary to conclude an agreement with the operator and install sensors that will connect to the Internet via the mobile network.  This is especially important for projects such as automated parking and unmanned vehicles.  Yes, unmanned cars - this is also part of IoT. <br><br>  IoT will become the basis, firstly, for the unmanned movement of vehicles, and secondly, for global automation in the production of goods and products, in the energy sector and, of course, in trade.  In Russia, shops will surely appear in which products can be bought without queuing at the cash desk, cash and wallet.  By the way, <a href="http://www.artezio.ru/">Artezio has</a> developed a project for a fully automated store that will compete with Amazon Go. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/acb/0d3/026/acb0d302680a2ed56d63707a1d0c083f.jpg"><br>  <i>Than not the Internet of things - the tsarina obviously fixed the sensor on the dog in order to remotely monitor the stepdaughter's movements</i> <br><br><h3>  Artificial intelligence as a companion of natural </h3><br>  Artificial intelligence is a rather vague concept that includes many technical developments: neural networks, robotics, pattern recognition, algorithms, etc.  But still it is the intellect, that is, in essence, a trained computing structure.  Its difference from the human mind is narrow specialization and the inability to switch between profiles of mental activity. <br><br>  AI has enormous prospects for application in all spheres of life.  The use of artificial intelligence makes it possible to create dynamic, flexible and relatively autonomous systems.  This means that these systems should be used where, for example, a person cannot cope with accuracy (in industry) or encounters threats to life and safety (in atomic energy, in underwater work, in the military sphere).  And in medicine, where they expect a breakthrough from AI, its role is still advisory.  AI is used for diagnosis, but on the basis of the conclusion of AI alone, they will not be diagnosed - because of the risk that the AI ‚Äã‚Äãdid not take into account the symptoms, details and circumstances.  To do this, you still need a flexible thinking person. <br><br><h3>  Blockchain is time to untie from bitcoin </h3><br>  Wherever you talk about the blockchain, the first association with it is the bitcoins.  We are not going to talk about the fate of virtual currency (although our financiers see all the signs of a bubble in the hype), but we can talk about the blockchain itself. <br><br>  In 2018, the importance of the blockchain as a technology will only grow.  Already today one can see many examples when with the help of the blockchain business processes between many companies are rebuilt, intermediaries in relationships are eliminated, new business models are built.  Blockchain becomes the infrastructure for a reliable, decentralized registry of shared facts and knowledge about all sorts of digital assets and their movements between ecosystem participants. <br><br>  And if we have already heard about the first blockchain transactions in banks and exchanges, then today the technology is rapidly spreading to health care, education, logistics, and even government relations. <br><br>  In 2018, we will see even more new implementations and applications of the blockchain, as well as examples of technology testing in combat mode and the first industrial implementations.  But do not forget that the blockchain is still at the very beginning of its journey and there is still no technological platform that would be the undisputed leader.  The blockchain platform market is now more like the search engine market before Google, or social networks before Facebook, or mobile platforms before iOS and Android. <br><br>  And therefore the task of the next year is to find business cases that without the use of the blockchain would be simply impossible. <br><br><h3>  Virtual and augmented reality is already real </h3><br>  AR / VR is a sensational story that has not yet demonstrated its full potential.  The most popular area of ‚Äã‚Äãuse at the moment is games and entertainment.  But already in 2016 and 2017 serious retail projects were implemented.  And here we have something to brag about: our start-up virtual reality application developer <a href="https://fibrum.com/">Fibrum has</a> <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/lanit/blog/344944/">created a platform for AliExpress, which became the basis of Ali's store in 11 cities of Russia</a> .  The solution is unique in that it is built on Web-VR technology, that is, a phone browser and Internet access are enough to visit the store, even virtual reality glasses are optional.  As you already understood, the virtual store is quite cheap for the retailer, which means that the successful experience will be broadcast further. <br><br>  In general, the success of Fibrum indicates a high consumer and business interest in VR.  The Fibrum portfolio includes 36 different applications, including Roller Coaster VR, Zombie Shooter VR, VR Cinema, Space Stalker VR.  The new project Desirium combines many different VR-content in one cross-platform application, which saves the user time.  All Fibrum VR applications work with any mobile virtual reality helmets.  Over the 4 years of the startup‚Äôs existence, the number of organic installations of the company's applications has exceeded 20 million worldwide.  The Fibrum portfolio includes more than 30 successful B2B projects implemented for clients such as the Government of Moscow, the Ministry of Culture of the Russian Federation, the Russian Military Historical Society, Yandex Taxi, Russian Post, Google, Carlsberg Group, Kinomax, Tricolor TV ‚Äù, AUTO24, InterContinental Moscow Tverskaya, Kashubadesign. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a7a/272/928/a7a2729280202e844ad5259ebce0c3c4.jpg"></div>  <i>Here it is, augmented reality: she gave up with a hand - and there both swans, and lakes, and everything in the middle of the banquet</i> <br><br>  We are not sure that AR / VR will make a powerful leap in 2018, but the ongoing development will definitely continue.  Also at the forefront of development will be mixed reality, which does not replace something, but only improves or complements.  We think that in addition to retail, cultural institutions, museums, medical companies, training centers of companies, military training centers and even advanced driving schools will be interested in virtual reality.  The main bonus of AR / VR is the security of some actions that are dangerous in real life (for example, emulation of training in the use of military equipment). <br><br><h3>  Smart city technology on the streets of his native country </h3><br>  The smart city is the widest field of application of information technologies and engineering innovations.  A modern city is a colossal integrated environment in which everyone should be comfortable.  And 2018 will bring a lot of new things to the life of Russian cities - partly as a result of already started projects, partly because of innovations for the World Cup. <br><br>  We have already <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/lanit/blog/341296/">written about how they implemented some elements of the smart city in Zaryadye Park</a> , and we think that the experience gained will be broadcast further.  But one of the most interesting stories happened in Birobidzhan - we want similar projects to be implemented in other cities of Russia. <br><br>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/lanit/blog/331302/">We have established our own production of LED lamps</a> in the framework of energy service contracts ( <a href="https://www.lanitp.ru/">LANIT-PARTNER</a> ).  The peculiarity of the market of LED street lamps in Russia is the excessive supply.  Many manufacturers in a competitive race often sacrifice quality.  It is very difficult to find good lighting options at a reasonable price.  Therefore, LANIT-PARTNER, as part of its energy service contracts (for example, a project to replace street lamps in Birobidzhan (Jewish Autonomous Region)) began to produce lamps itself.  This allows you to be confident in their long-term operation. <br><br>  It is in these projects that we also see a social function.  Once upon a time, as a child, one of our employees read an excerpt like this: ‚ÄúAnd now, when you put out a light bulb in your hallway or bathroom, somewhere a huge hydroelectric station sighs with relief and the river works a little less.‚Äù  And it is this phrase that occurs in the soul and in thoughts when we make high-quality and economical lighting of cities.  By the way, one more eternal trend comes from such promises - work on environmental issues.  And, believe me, we not only save the forests, but also do everything to ensure that the <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/lanit/blog/332888/">white bears as often as possible look through the windows of the gallant Arctic engineers</a> . <br><br>  Working with complex integration projects, we always remember that the city is first of all citizens.  And they need convenient advanced digital services. <br><br>  LANIT is one of the key participants in the largest metropolitan health project to create and develop the Unified Medical Information and Analytical System (EMIAS) of Moscow.  It gives patients the opportunity not only to sign up for a doctor in various ways, but also provides modern electronic services: an electronic medical record, an electronic prescription, disability certificates, etc.  As a result, doctors spend less time on paper routine and spend more time on the patient.  In 2018, the EMIAS capabilities will be expanded. <br><br>  Today, more than 9.5 million unique patients are registered in the system.  The total number of appointments to see a doctor is more than 388 million. An average of 250 thousand patients use the service daily.  Issued more than 42.5 million prescriptions in electronic form.  3.7 million hospital certificates were issued in electronic form, 6.2 million electronic medical records were filed. <br><br>  Thanks to EMIAS, the queues for self-recording were reduced by more than 2 times.  Waiting for the start of admission in most cases does not exceed 15-20 minutes, which corresponds to international practice. <br><br>  This is a powerful, serious project that allowed our capital to occupy a leading position in the field of electronic services not only in Russia, but also in the world.  This is confirmed by the results of reports of the largest international research companies and international awards: <br><br><ul><li>  According to the results of the report ‚ÄúData-Driven Cities - 2016‚Äù, PricewaterhouseCoopers Moscow is one of the world leaders in implementing data-based solutions. <br></li><li>  in 2017, Moscow received the Global MobileGov Awards 2017 international award, which is awarded for achievements in the development of electronic mobile services for citizens by the state.  The prize was awarded to the Information Technology Department of Moscow for the creation of EMIAS. <br></li></ul><br><h3>  Digital state for living people </h3><br>  Today, almost every citizen of Russia has several gadgets and at least one (at least working) PCs, which for him are both a store, reference and entertainment, a multimedia center and, of course, a service delivery center: taxi order, air tickets, choice and order of food and much more.  The trend is again evident in large companies: they produce maps, navigators, blog platforms and even telemedicine applications.  The person turns into homo digital and its natural habitat, especially in densely populated cities, becomes virtual space.  So, the state must accept the rules of the game and also become digital. <br><br>  At the moment we have already implemented several important projects that can be considered elements of the digital state.  First of all, it is <a href="https://dom.gosuslugi.ru/">GIS utilities</a> .  The system united all market participants: managing and resource-supplying companies, executive authorities and local governments, tenants - altogether more than 85 thousand organizations throughout the country.  In this sense, there are no analogues in the world to the created system.  It has a publicly accessible part where you can get acquainted with the news, legislation in the sphere of housing and communal services, information about management companies, you can also find out tariffs, get information about subsidies, benefits and programs in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãhousing and communal services, about housing facilities, etc.  Information on property, bills, payments made, meter readings, etc. is available to registered users in the personal account.  We <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/lanit/blog/321476/">talked in detail about this project in our blog</a> . <br><br>  And, of course, we must not forget that cars that have become part of the digital transformation have firmly entered our lives.  And here there is an interesting and necessary project, carried out by us together with the Russian Union of Motor Insurers (PCA) - the information system ‚ÄúElectronic policy of CTPO‚Äù, which is part of the AIS PCA. <br><br>  The system "Electronic policy OSAGO" has a nationwide scale.  It allows you to draw up CTP policies in electronic form, even if the website of the insurance company is not available.  With the introduction of an electronic policy, policyholders can purchase an MTPL policy via the Internet at any time of the day, seven days a week, from anywhere in Russia and pay for it by credit card or using other types of electronic payments.  Insurers also had the opportunity to reduce sales chains and reduce costs for the network of insurance agents.  And traffic police officers can now check the driver for the existence of a valid CTP insurance contract in real time.  It is also very important that the risk of buying a fake CTP policy is excluded. <br><br>  The main task of 2018 will be the integration of disparate services into a single digital ecosystem, training and informing citizens, the creation of new user-friendly applications and services. <br><br><h3>  Additive technologies (3D and 4D printing) for great things. </h3><br>  Despite the fact that some of us have 3D printers on the table at home or at work, private use is not the main goal of their existence (although the market is growing and will continue to grow).  Modeling and design, medicine, food industry, transport - areas in which 3D and 4D technologies will develop by leaps and bounds. <br><br>  From 2018, we are, on the one hand, waiting for new portable printers for home use, and on the other - the first successful experiments in medicine, new solutions in the industry.  Again, modeling with the help of such technologies allows reproducing complex objects with an accuracy of a screw and analyzing behavior in the laboratory without risking human lives and the environment.  We are confident that 3D and 4D should also significantly reduce their cost. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/45d/fdb/692/45dfdb6925fe3f3e96a6e42680c253cf.jpg"><br>  <i>Self-painted cloth - the first food 3D-printer with high print speed</i> <br><br><h3>  Big data and analytics for business use </h3><br>  Many companies are thinking about using the data array that they generate using a huge number of computing devices, sensors and other electronics.  Only you need to understand what data to store and why.  Even more difficult is the question of how to analyze this data.  So far the most obvious area of ‚Äã‚Äãuse is the creation of programs that can replace human labor in routine or dangerous areas. <br><br>  Data scientists are helping businesses formulate and clarify big data analytics tasks.  But we think that in 2018 powerful and accessible analytics tools will appear that will help to work with the data not only for professionals, but also for specialists - for customers of analytics.  Once happened to OLAP and BI.  Hopefully, history will repeat itself and convenient, generally applicable utilities will replace the narrowly professional tools. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/596/309/fce/596309fce364ac260495d2d55f0755c9.jpg"><br>  <i>Emelya received from pike the application software with voice control, which set in motion all the vehicles</i> <br><br><h3>  Cloud technology continues to conquer the world </h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It would seem that the clouds do in the forecast for the future, when they have become commonplace and even boring present. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Nevertheless, this technology will remain mega-dynamic over the next few years. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The value of clouds is in their reliability, low cost for customers, and the absence of capital expenditures. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The cloud provides easy scaling and allows you to create and deploy service-oriented models, to guarantee computing power for business purposes. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In addition, clouds have penetrated into the lives of private users.</font></font><br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f7c/f89/7a9/f7cf897a9d34e8c524094a6d25167277.jpg"></div> <i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And GLONASS, and GPS, and the navigator in one tangle, which brought so many heroes to the right path</font></font></i> <br><br>  But the complete victory of the clouds in 2018, as in the following years, should not be expected - business, especially medium and large, prudently relates to the storage of data and customer bases in the cloud.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">According to the Dimensiondata report, 55% of the companies' representatives surveyed stated that the main reason that keeps them from using leased facilities is a security issue. 46% consider cost management the most difficult in cloud infrastructure. This means that it is too early for cloud providers to rest on their laurels - it is time to increase the security of services and develop mechanisms to combat cyber threats. We think that the peak of creating small data centers and data centers has passed, and large, reliable centers will be formed on the market. They also have the mission of creating systems for the physical protection and protection of information. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We have tracked this trend, equipping and deploying the largest data centers.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">One example is the construction of a data center in Skolkovo, the largest in Russia and one of the largest in Europe. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A year and a half ago, on June 4, 2016, </font></font><a href="http://www.in-systems.ru/"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">INSISTEMS</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> scored the first pile, and the delivery of the first stage of the facility took place on December 16, 2017. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is extremely fast. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">On average, such data centers surrender in 36 months, but if very quickly, in 24-25 months. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">INSISTEMS makes in 18 months. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The company was able to reduce the time because it used the factory premises (rented) to assemble parts of the system. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Then these parts are mounted. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This reduces installation time: assembling systems from prefabricated parts faster than installing everything directly at the site. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Improving the quality of systems.</font></font><br><br><h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Safety first </font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Of course, these are the main areas of "enterprise" innovation. Outside the post are no less interesting, but, of course, less ambitious issues. For example, business process management systems, chat rooms and chat bots, mobile services and mobile technologies. Obviously, all these areas will grow and develop in 2018.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But the development of all these technologies involves continuously increasing risks. Unfortunately, the dark side of information technology does not lag behind the bright one, and hackers are armed with no less powerful tools and no less developed mind. According to the Dimensiondata report, during which techno-leaders around the world were surveyed, in 2016 49% of business was attacked by extortionists, extortionists were able to earn about 1 million dollars, the most vulnerable were: professional and business services (28%), authorities ( 19%), medicine and health care (19%), retail (15%). </font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d4d/a8b/3d1/d4da8b3d18ffddf345bcd894c6ac2746.png"><br> <i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Multistage security system in the service of Kashchei Immortal</font></font></i> <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Digital business has unprecedented security requirements. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The more complex the systems and tools, the higher the threat potential. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Therefore, business, working with modern technologies, is simply obliged to continuously assess risks and make changes to security levels. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For example, today a new term has appeared - DevSecOps, which in 2018 will certainly become the topic of discussion at specialized conferences and will be introduced in companies. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Yes, the world is created by an enterprise, but a vulnerable enterprise needs security that will evolve at the same speed as the digital transformation. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">First of all, because late detection of a security hole can cost a lot of money.</font></font><br><br><h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> And to us, professionals, where to go? </font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Based on the list of technologies, it is possible to understand approximately which specialists with what skills will be in demand - after all, someone should create our technological future today. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But the business area is huge and the demand stack is huge. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We walked through various platforms and found out which programming languages ‚Äã‚Äãwill be in demand in 2018 and the coming years. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It turned out curious. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">So, according to the </font></font><a href="http://pypl.github.io/PYPL.html"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">PYPL</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> (PopularitY of Programming Language) </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">rating </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">on GitHub, the first 10 languages ‚Äã‚Äãin terms of the frequency of search for educational materials look like this: Java (21.5%), Python (19.3%), PHP (8.3%), JavaScript (7.9%), C # (7.6%), C (6.3%), C ++ (6.3%), R (3.8%), Objective-C (3.8%), Swift (3%). </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In this case, the most growing in the ranking was Python. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Another Search Based Ranking, </font></font><a href="https://tiobe.com/tiobe-index/"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">TIOBE</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Shows a similar result. </font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rg/r_/-v/rgr_-vyhfu24sfyoesstqdkde4s.png"><br>  <a href="http://pypl.github.io/PYPL.html"><i>A source</i></a> <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">StackOverflow‚Äôs opinion cannot be left aside - there you can look at the rating of specialists and the rating of languages. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Again, some intersecting trends are obvious:</font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/838/675/5ae/8386755aeb3953deef7f68133e3571a0.png"><br>  <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2017"><i>A source</i></a> <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But according to </font></font><a href="https://octoverse.github.com/"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">statistics of</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> pull requests on GitHub, the most popular language in 2017 is JavaScript, followed by Python, followed by Java, Ruby, PHP, C ++, etc.</font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/be0/664/335/be06643351f2a4b32713a2c599127c78.png"><br>  <a href="https://octoverse.github.com/"><i>A source</i></a> <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Let's try to figure out why these particular languages ‚Äã‚Äãare in favor and should they be studied today in order to be in demand in 3-5 years? </font></font><br><br><h3>  Javascript </h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Let's start with the leader pull requests on Github - with JavaScript. The language is popular and will be popular for a long time - this is due to the fact that the language is powerful, cross-platform and allows you to develop applications that work within a thin client (browser) to interact with the user. Accordingly, while browsers are alive, JavaScript will also live. The popularity of the language is added by flexible libraries, which appear almost every year and conquer the minds of millions of developers. Even if you just glimpse Habr, you probably have seen three of them - React.js. Angular.js and Vue.js. All three libraries are in demand including the enterprise.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">JavaScript is popular among other things because almost everyone knows it. The web is now the most active area in programming. All front-end developers are fluent in this language. From the backend point of view, nodejs as server side add popularity. Electron gives access to desktop applications. In general, the backend, from the point of view of languages, is much more fragmented compared to the front, therefore JavaScript firmly holds the lead.</font></font><br><br><h3>  Python </h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The growth leader is Python. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This language is popular for several reasons. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">First, it is an ideal, simple, understandable and succinct language for beginners. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This is probably the best language as the first meeting with programming. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And secondly, it is Python that is widely used in data science, big data, data mining. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This is an excellent tool for applied analysis, development of parsers and other applied and scientific utilities. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We are sure that this language will stay in the tops of all ratings for a long time. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Learn boldly.</font></font><br><br><h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Java and C ++ </font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We are not afraid of holivar and boldly say: Java is the king of programming languages. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And to shift it from the throne very few people in the teeth. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Java is an enterprise development standard, the main language of complex systems, financial and banking software and, of course, Android development. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And we in LANIT, like nobody, know that good Java-developers are a terrible deficit, to which companies (including us) are ready to ensure a decent existence.</font></font><br><br><div class="spoiler"> <b class="spoiler_title"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And we are just looking for developers to our team.</font></font></b> <div class="spoiler_text"><ul><li>  <a href="https://job.lanit.ru/vacancy/Pages/BPM-21.aspx%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dpost-10-01%26utm_campaign%3Dhabr">Java developer.</a>  <a href="https://job.lanit.ru/vacancy/Pages/BPM-21.aspx%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dpost-10-01%26utm_campaign%3Dhabr">Business Process Management</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://job.lanit.ru/vacancy/Pages/CD-02.aspx%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dpost-10-01%26utm_campaign%3Dhabr">Java developer.</a>  <a href="https://job.lanit.ru/vacancy/Pages/CD-02.aspx%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dpost-10-01%26utm_campaign%3Dhabr">Developing a big data cloud management platform</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://job.lanit.ru/vacancy/Pages/CH-127.aspx%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dpost-10-01%26utm_campaign%3Dhabr">Senior Big Data Developer</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://job.lanit.ru/vacancy/pages/ch-122.aspx/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dpost-10-01%26utm_campaign%3Dhabr">Java Lead Developer</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://job.lanit.ru/vacancy/pages/ch-144.aspx/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dpost-10-01%26utm_campaign%3Dhabr">Java developer</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://job.lanit.ru/vacancy/Pages/CH-128.aspx%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dpost-10-01%26utm_campaign%3Dhabr">Senior Java Developer</a> </li></ul><br></div></div><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Java is a fairly simple language. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But its ecosystem is complex and simply huge - it‚Äôs really easy to navigate and own all the technologies in it. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This is nothing but the flip side of huge popularity. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Java is an initial development language, a backend language for the web. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Work on C ++ is more system programming or something very high-performance (such as High Frequency Trading on exchanges). </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Either games. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the business logic of C ++ is involved not so often. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Again, if we speak in the context of our forecasts on the technologies above, then something demanding of resources will also choose C ++ (for example, programming IoT sensors).</font></font><br><br><h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> WITH# </font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Does not give up its position with #. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Development for the Microsoft .NET platform is conducted mainly on it, C # is used when developing toys on Unity. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And there are also prospects for long and happy work, because it is enough that C # is the brainchild of the Microsoft giant, and due to its openness, it gradually leaks to other platforms. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Therefore, this platform definitely has prospects, especially while Microsoft is doing well.</font></font><br><br><h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> PHP and Ruby </font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Well, let us say separately about PHP and Ruby - despite the karmoprolitnye battles of supporters and opponents of these languages, they remain popular for the field of e-commerce and web applications. There are more specialists here, but nevertheless, the demand in the labor market remains. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Ruby, in our opinion, is becoming less attractive at the moment. Previously, Python and Ruby went head to head, but Python, among other things, received great support in data science, Python also has Django, Flask for backend. So, maybe, there is no point in learning two languages, if one Python can provide more yuzkeys for itself. But it all depends on the company and on specific projects in which the programmer wants to work.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If you are not sure whether to learn a language, browse Google Trends sources, estimate the number of vacancies for each language. Do not forget that there are, for example, SQL and noSQL, which will be useful in any project and their knowledge will be a significant advantage on your career path. And there are many such technologies, you can find your own for any level of training and understanding. Yes, every year (if not monthly) new programming languages ‚Äã‚Äãappear that attract new adherents and ardent opponents, but this does not mean that it is worth rushing to learn the one that is in trend.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Of course, this is the near future, based on trends, but these are not the only patterns in the development of the software development industry. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Certainly, new programming languages ‚Äã‚Äãand frameworks will appear, new race leaders will be determined: we think there will be a lot of interesting things in Go, Scala, Kotlin. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This is how motley and different we see 2018. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Of course, it will be even more technological and fast. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Thousands of games and new applications will be created in space and the automotive industry, industry and development. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Or maybe there will be new social networks and instant messengers. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And maybe, at the end of 2018, in them we will read a short note that the future has accelerated and we are not 150 years old to full automation, but only 120. In general, we are waiting for the words of the song to come true that robots are injected, happy person.</font></font></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/346302/">https://habr.com/ru/post/346302/</a></p>
