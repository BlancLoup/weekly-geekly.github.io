It seems that in July of this year the army of extraordinary new products was replenished with another bright representative.  We suggest to pay attention to the unique mouse of its kind with the laconic name ‚ÄúThe Z‚Äù, presented on the Kikstarter platform by Swiftpoint (New Zealand), already known to us from its previous more than successful product - <a href="http://www.swiftpoint.com/News%2B%2BReviews.html">Swiftpoint GT Mobile Mouse</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/dd2/6e6/d08/dd26e6d0819d8deab3d7943449cf3817.gif" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The Swiftpoint company, which won awards at CES 2015, in two nominations launches a new innovative product on the market - the multifunctional mouse ‚ÄúThe Z‚Äù, which, according to developers and journalists, has several reputable publications at the same time being the most advanced mouse ever created.  It is difficult to judge how such statements correspond to the real state of things, but the project felt quite confident at the site, having collected the targeted funds necessary to start the production line 39 more days before the end of the campaign. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d6d/35a/c71/d6d35ac7135588aa45dc4b0065a908c5.jpg" alt="image">

      The ‚ÄúThe Z‚Äù mouse is not only sensitive to movements in the horizontal plane, it can recognize tilts left-right relative to the longitudinal axis and turns left-right relative to the vertical axis, respond to user‚Äôs gestures literally, being in the air and not touching the rug .  Included are removable legs that allow you to adjust the available angles of inclination over a wide range and interact with the computer in a faster, more accurate and intuitive way. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f3d/4d2/a2c/f3d4d2a2c7ccc96a9892fe942889a097.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The mouse is equipped with a scroll wheel and seventeen buttons.  Four of them are pressure sensitive.  To ensure optimal tactile response and pressing force, it is possible to program up to 80 different gradations.  The pressing force allows you to change the parameters for moving an object, and tactile feedback, in turn, adjusts the force of clicking.  The kit includes overlays for buttons, allowing, if desired and within the necessary limits, to change their geometrical dimensions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5e9/f4b/e16/5e9f4be16cbaf1b7717023b13e18eb0b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The design incorporates PixArt PMW 3360 optical sensor with a resolution of 12,000 dpi.  Connecting to a computer via a standard USB port.  Poll frequency - 1000 Hz.  The set comes with a rug and an original aluminum cube with slots, in which it is convenient to fasten a cable, usually dangling on the table and creating a lot of problems in the implementation of responsible manipulations. <br><br>  The mouse is completed with an accelerometer, a gyroscope and an OLED display that displays the current priority information. <br><br>  <b>Tilt up / down and left / right</b> <br><br>  With the help of ‚ÄúZ‚Äù you can change the angle of inclination up or down, left and right and achieve a quick mode change without the need to use your fingers or press buttons.  In this case, a certain slope can be put in compliance with almost any action. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6a7/231/7ca/6a72317cab63c719b01bcdcf54d7443b.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  "Z" will also allow you to instantly turn the object left or right to the desired angle, which gives a serious competitive advantage in battle game scenes. <br><br>  As well as tilt, you can assign any action, modifier (for example, control or shift) relative to the axis of rotation.  Everything is flexible and quickly configured. <br><br>  <b>Pitch, roll and yaw - in the air or on the ground</b> <br><br>  The Z knows when she is on the table and when she is above it.  So in the Battlefield gaming episodes, if it‚Äôs more convenient, you can lift the mouse over the table and control the events on the screen, keeping it in the air. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/80e/cac/637/80ecac6374a3964558463613bc0a0de9.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>50 interactive actions barely moving a finger</b> <br><br>  Most mice are equipped with a variety of additional buttons located both next to the finger and in other parts of the body.  The developers of ‚ÄúZ‚Äù have proposed a new way of contacting buttons, based on the use of tactile sensitivity features.  This allows, by changing the strength or character of the pressure, to provide no less functionality and simulate the various movements of the game character or object. <br><br>  By combining touch and tilt within various combinations, the creators of the ‚ÄúZ‚Äù expanded the possibilities for accessing 50 different actions (48 + left and right click). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a1e/d45/c61/a1ed45c618d4f71c935c8e31dc07cd82.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  The two front / side buttons and the two thumb buttons of the ScrollWheel provide additional options for setting priority functions. <br><br>  <b>Deep click with tactile feedback</b> <br><br>  The main left and right buttons and two buttons for the tip of the finger support the Deep Click option, which can be turned off if desired. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f32/884/d84/f32884d84d9a830ad011bd71fd80c59f.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>"The Z" - a multifunctional precision tool for designers</b> <br><br>  Artists, designers, surgeons, carpenters ..., working with a computer can not do without tools that allow you to realize the idea with extreme precision.  "Z", according to its creators, will become an indispensable working tool for such specialists. <br><br>  "The Z" will provide the ability to perform such popular manipulations as panning, zooming, rotating in CAD and the like, and controlling along 6 axes of coordinates in the air will open up new possibilities for manipulating 3D objects, <br><br>  Using software such as Photoshop and Illustrator, it will be very convenient to use push-sensitive buttons to set the desired thickness of the brush, and using the response to rotation to create wide natural strokes.  In the ‚ÄúTactile‚Äù ‚ÄúZ‚Äù mode, due to the gradations of tactile sensitivity, an ultra-precise (up to several pixels) positioning of the object is achieved. <br><br>  <b>OLED screen</b> <br><br>  One of the priorities when creating ‚ÄúThe Z‚Äù is the ability to easily and quickly customize options and modes.  To this end, on one of the side faces, the developers added a miniature demonstration OLED display that displays the profiles of the current configuration and user manipulations. <br><br>  In its current performance, ‚ÄúThe Z‚Äù has become wired.  This, according to Swiftpoint engineers, will eliminate the dependence on problems typical of a wireless connection - battery charge, reliability of the communication channel, etc. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/091/8ed/45a/0918ed45ac0c0ac3b5760d6f58ecb549.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1c5/82f/ce7/1c582fce72cde53302a5c5474eee473b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Ergonomics</b> <br><br>  As the authors of the project say in their presentation on Kickstarter: their previous mouse model, the Swiftpoint GT Mobile Mouse, was recognized as the ‚Äúmost comfortable mouse on the market‚Äù (according to the version of The Huffington Post). <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/-0lQCj4SLDg%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,1500001,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhboPMZxs8rl8KDeuUSlg1HreUDgw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <i><sub>A brief excursion into the past</sub></i> <br><br>  The full-sized ‚ÄúThe Z‚Äù mouse is intended to be a continuation and further development of the previous project, a new standard of quality and comfort, born as a result of the creation and understanding of the capabilities of hundreds of tested prototypes. <br><br>  <b>Specification</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/edf/a48/061/edfa48061ddca986802e239f0fb80e19.png" alt="image"><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/twNFy5t35sU%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,1500001,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhi04KBy4KPThrp1M40LgzcUqtriSw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  The cost of the minimum set on Kickstarter is $ 139.
