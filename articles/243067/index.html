New features of the C # 6 language simplify many routine actions, and the new ‚Äúlight bulbs‚Äù suggesting options for improving your code will allow you to quickly make corrections to the necessary sections.  Due to the extensibility of these mechanisms, developers will be able to release their code analysis packages based on the Roslyn technology and connect them to Visual Studio. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4b3/b1b/b60/4b3b1bb607705608437ee16bc1356beb.png"><br><br>  Visual Studio 2015 also received a number of new improvements in debugging.  This includes new <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/visualstudioalm/archive/2014/10/06/new-breakpoint-configuration-experience.aspx">breakpoint configuration</a> system, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/visualstudioalm/archive/2014/08/18/perftips-performance-information-at-a-glance-while-debugging-with-visual-studio.aspx">performance tips</a> , debugging, and eval lambda functions in the variable viewer. <br><img src="http://litehtmlconv.azurewebsites.net/api/pics/jkcy5g8su2eoqqzdhj5zq2vd"><br>  Also in Visual Studio 2015 appeared Smart Unit Tests technology, familiar to users of Microsoft Pex.  Released from Microsoft Research, this technology allows you to generate unit tests for your code, and all the conditions will be created to bypass the code branching. <br>  For developers of desktop applications based on WPF, there are also updates in the toolkit, including the Visual Studio Diagnostic Tool, the Timeline Tool and the updated Blend editor.  You can read these new items in the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/dotnet/archive/2014/11/12/the-roadmap-for-wpf.aspx">blog</a> . <br><br><h5>  Cloud </h5><br>  Visual Studio 2015 is the most cloud-oriented development tool.  Integration with Azure and Visual Studio Online allows you to get maximum productivity when creating cloud solutions. <br>  .NET 2015 includes ASP.NET 5, a new composite framework for building web and cloud applications.  ASP.NET 5 is a cross-platform technology that supports the ability to run applications of different versions within a single server. <br>  In addition to the server tools, special extensions were also created for popular code editors, for example, <a href="http://blog.jonathanchannon.com/2014/11/12/csharp-first-class-citizen-sublime-text/">Sublime</a> , in which you can use syntax highlighting and automatic prompts in other operating systems: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/141/ce0/bf0/141ce0bf0be9282899b9ef2b9e6af5ec.png"><br><br>  In Visual Studio 2015, the service manager has also been updated, allowing you to conveniently manage your servers and cloud services, including on behalf of several accounts. <br>  Developers creating solutions based on Office 365 can take advantage of the <a href="http://dev.office.com/getting-started">API</a> set included in <a href="http://aka.ms/OfficeDevToolsForVS2013">Office Developer Tools for Visual Studio</a> . <br><br><h5>  Cross-platform and mobile development </h5><br>  The Xamarin platform allows developers to create applications for a variety of platforms right in Visual Studio.  Our long-term partnership with Xamarin continues, and we are pleased to present new opportunities: <br><ul><li>  For MSDN subscribers, there is a <a href="http://www.xamarin.com/msdn">discount on Xamarin Business and Enterprise</a> . </li><li>  Improved integration between Visual Studio and Xamarin tools, including the ability to install Xamarin from Visual Studio. </li><li>  In the future, Xamarin will add support for the Xamarin Starter Edition for users of the Visual Studio Community, opening up the possibilities of cross-platform development on .NET for more developers. </li></ul><img src="http://litehtmlconv.azurewebsites.net/api/pics/30hkh29iotc_6nvqsqtdwqsd"><br><br><h5>  C ++ </h5><br>  The C ++ language remains the leader in the development of high-performance applications.  For mobile developers, C ++ is a key component for creating gaming applications and high-performance libraries that can run on a wide range of devices. <br>  Together with the release of Visual Studio 2015, developers will get a complete set of tools for cross-platform application development in C ++.  These features include integration with the Clang platform, the LLVM optimizer and support for platforms such as Android and iOS.  You can <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/visualstudioalm/archive/2014/11/12/debugging-c-code-on-android-with-visual-studio-2015.aspx">edit and debug</a> C ++ code for the three main platforms, Windows, iOS and Android. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0c8/c5b/e1e/0c8c5be1ec02d6062de723277142abaa.png"><br><br>  Visual Studio 2015 also includes a number of new amenities for C ++ developers, including a new refactoring mode, an improved file search dialog, and an optimized incremental build mode, which significantly speeds up the assembly of large projects.  At the same time, the compiler includes some new features for supporting the standards C ++ 11, C ++ 14, and the preliminary revision of the standard C ++ 17. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4b3/8b9/b6c/4b38b9b6ca9041457647029ed52841c5.png"><br><br><h5>  HTML / JavaScript and Apache Cordova </h5><br>  Mobile applications are increasingly being developed using HTML5 and JavaScript technologies.
