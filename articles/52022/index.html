On the site that specializes in publishing video from Ruby-related conferences, recordings of speeches have been posted. <br><br>  Speeches in English. <br><br>  On each report, I post a brief information: name, duration, a brief description and url.  After reading this RSS-shaped dataset, you can understand whether the report is interesting for you or you should watch something else.

      Who might be interested?  This may sound strange, but the most interesting, in my opinion, reports are quite universal.  They cover topics that will be interesting to people no matter what programming language they use.  Of course, with knowledge of Ruby it will be easier to understand the examples, but the ideas that are presented can be used in different languages.  Two reports that I would like to focus on - The Grand Unified Theory ... and Relaxing with CouchDB <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Title: Innovation in Rails <br>  Tags: deployment, shoulda, factory girl, cache money, webrat, bort, workling, social networks, github, proxy <br>  Duration: 55 minutes <br>  Description: The guys from envy celebrate the year from the beginning of the recording of their podcasts and on this occasion arrange a small analysis of changes in the rail world over the past year.  They talk about changes in deployment, testing, caching, template presets for rail projects, working with queues, expanding open-source to the size of entire projects, changes in version control systems.  After reviewing the achievements of the national economy, the speakers talk about their new project, which is completely devoted to the extensibility of projects on the tracks.  Now - February 14, 2009 - about a dozen podcasts have been published on this site, telling how to speed up the project on the tracks.  The report describes the theory of how reverse proxy servers work.  How to use such servers in applications is described on the example of Rack-cache. <br>  URL: <a href="http://aac2009.confreaks.com/06-feb-2009-09-00-innovation-in-rails-gregg-pollack-jason-seifer.html">aac2009.confreaks.com/06-feb-2009-09-00-innovation-in-rails-gregg-pollack-jason-seifer.html</a> <br><br>  Title: Live Video Q &amp; A <br>  Tags: DHH <br>  Duration: 46 minutes <br>  Description: The creator rails answers questions.

So far, the project is closed, but the authors promise to post it as open-source on github. <br>  URL: <a href="http://aac2009.confreaks.com/07-feb-2009-10-00-browsercms-patrick-peak-and-paul-barry.html">aac2009.confreaks.com/07-feb-2009-10-00-browsercms-patrick-peak-and-paul-barry.html</a> <br><br>  Name: TATFT: The Layman's Guide <br>  Tags: testing <br>  Duration: 56 minutes <br>  Description: TATFT == test all the fucking time.

In such databases there are no tables with familiar columns and rows.  Instead of tables, all data is stored as a key + value pair, where the key is the object id and the data is a hash with all the object data.  Where it is useful, where it can be used and how to work with databases constructed in this way is said in the report.  Despite the title, the speaker could not relax with CouchDB. <br>  URL: <a href="http://aac2009.confreaks.com/07-feb-2009-16-00-relaxing-with-couchdb-will-leinweber.html">aac2009.confreaks.com/07-feb-2009-16-00-relaxing-with-couchdb-will-leinweber.html</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/52022/">https://habr.com/ru/post/52022/</a></p>
