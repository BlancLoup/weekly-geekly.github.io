During the event, participants and guests of the forum were able to discuss the present and the future of the cloud sphere in our country, the existing problems in the industry and the possible ways to solve them. <br><br>  The Moscow Hotel Lotte Plaza, selected as a forum, accommodated more than a hundred guests - recognized IT experts, representatives of government-related structures, and businessmen. <br>  ‚ÄúWe set the task to create a platform where providers and consumers of cloud services could meet, technical specialists share experience in using the most advanced technologies, and business representatives to discover new opportunities for themselves,‚Äù said Nikita Tsaplin, managing partner of RUVDS, during the welcome speech. <a name="habracut"></a>

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/691/6be/cc3/6916becc37a44c66a82b212991dea71a.jpg"><br><br>  The forum opened with a plenary session ‚ÄúThe development of cloud technologies in Russia.  New reality: vectors of development and major problems ‚Äù, during which the speakers discussed the main trends in the development of cloud technologies, the benefits of application, as well as the features and difficulties of implementation in a number of business areas, in particular construction. <br><br>  The representative of ZAO Dynamo CJSC, Alexander Kustarev, a company that is currently engaged in construction of VTB Arena Park, said that there is almost no software in Russia to solve the problems of the construction sector, they have to do a lot.  Currently, VTB Arena Park has its own automated document management system, its own data center, where all contractors and subcontractors are registered, which increases the pace of construction several times.  Also, Dynamo Management Company is developing a multi-service system for stadium maintenance, which it plans to replicate in the future.  Operation, maintenance, information security of large stadiums, stations, airports and other large public facilities can not be transferred to the cloud storage, according to the resolution 10.53, to counter terrorism.  Therefore, there are restrictions on the use of cloud storage in government structures. <br><br>  The deputy director of MFD-InfoCenter, Konstantin Ivaylovsky said that if the market competition is low and the software maturity is also low, then the solution will have to be created by ourselves, if the competition is high and the software maturity is high, then definitely it needs to be bought, as there is a very low threshold to enter. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1ca/d4d/81e/1cad4d81ee5841f1ad22dfd40757f1c3.JPG"><br>  In the photo from left to right: Tony Yan (Head of Commercial Customers Department, HUAWEI), Andrey Listopad (Head of Cloud Project Development, CARAVAN), Alexey Khoroshilov (General Director, UltraVDS) <br><br>  However, it was stated that even in those industries where consumers would like to delegate some of the responsibility to third-party providers, the IAAS sector is not yet ready to bear such responsibility.  To the question of the representative of the Federal State Unitary Enterprise "Space Communications" Alexei Shmonin about what services providers offer to transfer to the cloud, Andrei Listopad, Head of the Cloud Project Development Department of Caravan Aero, in particular, answered: "In principle, you can transfer anything , but I would not want to store the satellite communication system on my servers ... ‚Äù.  The remaining representatives of the providers agreed with him referring to the insufficient legal protection of suppliers when working with similar projects. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2e1/ccd/c41/2e1ccdc4128d428ab3dd8690f4789895.JPG"><br>  In the photo from left to right: Ilya Shkatulov (founder of IC Trasstromservice), Roman Fedorov (general director, Coworking 14), Dmitry Krasnov (head of the information technology department, JSIB Education) <br><br>  The participants of the round table came to the conclusion that it is necessary to regulate the market of IAAS services in Russia in order to establish an effective interaction between the consumer-supplier-regulator.  The special role of integrators in the distribution of cloud technologies in various business areas was also emphasized. <br><br>  Next, the guests were awaited by the session ‚ÄúData Protection - Modern Security Challenges‚Äù, which focused on the problem of lack of trust between cloud technology providers and service consumers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bbb/4d3/17d/bbb4d317d2e24efb8deb67cf252b8eac.JPG"><br>  In the photo from left to right: Kirill Zapolsky (head of development, Sberbank-technology), Artyom Paizansky (Finam), Vadim Frolov (general director, provider MTV.RU) <br><br>  The speakers agreed that protection legislation, although not perfect, fully covers most of the everyday tasks. <br><br>  The forum‚Äôs discussion program was completed with two round tables telling about the newest facets of cloud technology application - in the gaming industry and stock trading.  The latter turned out to be one of the brightest, having gathered all the major representatives of the exchange industry. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/022/152/87e/02215287e81a4673a67b2959b97a7da6.JPG"><br>  In the photo from left to right: Vadim Zakroychikov (Moscow Exchange), Nikita Tsaplin (Managing Partner, <a href="https://ruvds.com/">RUVDS</a> ) <br><br>  The speakers vividly discussed the various possibilities of applying VDS / <a href="https://ruvds.com/">VPS</a> cloud technologies, which were implemented and operated in their companies, the exchange policy in relation to cloud technologies, as well as various aspects of security when using these technologies.  The forum participants expressed their gratitude to RUVDS for the development of this type of services for brokerage companies and end customers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bdb/fad/56a/bdbfad56ad9a43f687a8f168434f3363.JPG"><br>  Lada Kobkina (project manager of brokerage business, BCS), Sergey Slukin (director of the DMA department, Finam), Yuri Maslov (managing director, board member of ITINVEST). <br><br>  In the second hall, at the same time, there was a heated discussion at the round table ‚ÄúGAAS: Computing Clouds for the Gaming Industry‚Äù.  Summing up, its participants concluded that the concept of GaaS in Russia, unlike the rest of the world, is still in its infancy and the market remains free.  You can also add that high prices for specialized hardware for the provision of such services and for the time being not too high demand for these services, constrain the development of the industry as a whole.  However, it is only a matter of time. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/724/a29/820/724a29820387431588bb5d9c38745d8c.JPG"><br>  Andrei Tomilenko (managing director of BigD.Host), Alexey Lykov (technical director of Playkey) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/91f/aeb/2f7/91faeb2f7d974e14a96d0e0b5740c7f8.JPG"><br>  Alexey Khoroshilov (CEO, UltraVDS), Evgeny Shagalov (Development Manager, RU <a href="https://ruvds.com/">VDS</a> ) <br><br>  After the completion of the main program, the guests of the event continued their communication in a relaxed atmosphere and dispersed in the evening. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/84c/95b/26a/84c95b26a6ae4ca2bf6227b9652a5eec.JPG"><br>  Lada Kobkina (project manager of brokerage business, BCS), Sergey Mikheev (director of the department, BCS), Pavel Sheviakov (BCS) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1ac/941/9f8/1ac9419f88c440a488b429efa6dd1075.JPG"><br>  Konstantin Ivaylovsky (deputy director, MFD), Yuri Savitsky (head of the algorithmic trading department, Zerich), Nikita Tsaplin (managing partner, RUVDS) <br><br>  In the lobby of the site, HUAWEI presentation stands were installed, demonstrating the latest developments in the field of server equipment installed in the data center of the RUVDS provider. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a55/354/f6e/a55354f6e89e4853bf431647405a4e27.JPG"><br>  Maria Ma (HUAWEI), QI XUELIANG (HUAWEI) <br><br>  Also during the event, guests were presented reports of the technology partner HUAWEI and various cloud integrators.  With the topics of the reports and presentations of the speakers, readers can find on the event website: <a href="http://cloudrussia.ru/present">http://cloudrussia.ru/present</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ca9/da7/9d5/ca9da79d584145e9a44c89e99ed0c043.JPG"><br>  Tony Yan (Head of Commercial Customer Relations, HUAWEI), Tsaplin (Managing Partner, RUVDS) <br><br>  RUVDS and HUAWEI hold a joint Forum for the first time and aim to gather the largest consumers of cloud services and discuss industry problems, especially the introduction of such systems by big business and state-owned companies, as well as possible regulatory and self-regulatory mechanisms for participants in this market.  The organizers said that such joint activities will be held on a regular basis. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/495/666/59c/49566659c1774d0b88bf4824d629df01.png"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/103/64d/3a0/10364d3a0b804fecbf834fb4b21705d4.png"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bc4/bc5/fa0/bc4bc5fa080749cc8525d95ccea07590.png"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8c5/8a3/697/8c58a3697819463b8dfe242ed9d690e3.png"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/304068/">https://habr.com/ru/post/304068/</a></p>
