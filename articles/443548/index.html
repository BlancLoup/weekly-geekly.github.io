    <h2>  How we search </h2><br>  The opportunity provided by the Internet, or rather the information that we can find in it, allows us to be more knowledgeable and picky today, especially when we want to purchase an expensive and specific product or service deliberately. <br><br>  To make the right choice that best meets our expectations, we accumulate competence.  ‚ÄúSurf‚Äù numerous web sites, gathering information from it about consumer properties of goods and services.  We choose by technical parameters, at the price, quality and guarantees. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Each of us spends a different amount of time searching.  Some people need only a few minutes, someone will spend a few hours on this, but someone will not have enough a month.  It also happens that if the first time was not able to gather the necessary information, then the search for the desired product or service stops for an indefinite amount of time. <br><br>  While we were looking for, the services and browsers we are used to, catching our search desires, begin to annoy us with the diversity of offers with advertising, sometimes blurring the focus of the search. <br><br>  Many in their search for attention to the availability of reviews, but most of us no longer believe in their veracity.  Intuitively, we understand that these are manipulations of skillful marketers and owners of resources that we go to when studying a product or service of interest to us. <br><br>  It‚Äôs quite another thing when we are reviewing video reviews and video reviews from experienced users, if they can be found online, in particular on YouTube.  But even there, if you purposefully aim at finding something sensible, you risk spending a lot of time before you make your choice. <br><br>  Some of us use resources like irecommend or otzovik.  They can find and read reviews on some consumer goods.  But in the 21st century you expect something more from such sites, for example, the availability of video tricks from real expert professionals, an application for smartphones, convenient navigation and modern technical capabilities. <br><br>  As a result, we collect information from the world on a thread, until we finally decide. <br><br>  And in cases where the choice was made, and the product or service purchased, and our expectations coincided with our needs, we feel satisfied. <br><br><h2>  What about business? </h2><br>  All of the above applies to commercial enterprises.  The same happens in them, because the same users work in such enterprises, like all of us, only they are called managers and analysts. <br><br>  These experts use the same search principles and the same resources.  And also spend their precious time. <br><br>  Especially often, companies interested in finding suitable high-quality raw materials for the production of their goods, and entrepreneurs who participate in government procurement as intermediaries, are engaged in network search. <br><br>  In addition, many business owners realized: <br><br><ul><li>  that recognition and promotion of their products in the network can no longer be done and are in search of effective tools; </li><li>  that reviews from real buyers stimulate to produce high-quality goods and provide quality services; </li><li>  that in the modern world goods and services can and should be sold around the clock. </li></ul><br><h2>  Assumption </h2><br>  And now, having gathered the presented picture together, a number of questions arise: <br><br><ul><li>  Is it convenient for us, the users of the modern Internet, to search using existing tools? </li><li>  Are we satisfied with this state of affairs, or are we still missing something? </li></ul><br>  There is a reasonable assumption that the service has collected well-structured material with expert reviews of products, services and companies producing them, and also submitted in all possible formats - text, video, photo or audio, with recommendations and real feedback from those who received experience. consumers will be in high demand. <br><br>  And so that the process of using such a resource would be not only useful and informative, but also an exciting activity, it would be great if with its help one can immediately buy the goods of interest at a discount or at a wholesale price and automatically earn money on recommendations. <br><br>  <b>What do you think, dear readers?</b> <br><br>  Thank you for attention. <br><br>  <i>The author - Alexander Davydov (March 2019).</i> <br><br>  <i>This article is part of the ongoing research, which will identify user preferences in deciding whether to purchase a product or service.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/443548/">https://habr.com/ru/post/443548/</a></p>
