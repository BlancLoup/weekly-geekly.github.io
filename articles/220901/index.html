We thank all customers and partners for participation and appreciation of the Forum. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f9e/284/1d9/f9e2841d9c7753a65f9810244972cbd0.jpg"><br><br>  Despite the fact that the Forum topic was at first glance rather narrow - Desktop Virtualization, interest in the event was high.  This is a good indicator of the relevance of the chosen topic, in fact reflecting all aspects of complete virtualization solutions.  It was nice to note the ‚Äúhit‚Äù in requests and expectations.

      For the first time, Dell chose a way to demonstrate solutions, starting with interfaces for the end corporate user, continuing to show infrastructure solutions, and ending with the exhibition of the products themselves.  In the zones representing the 4 main verticals of the market, the solutions were demonstrated live, thanks to the professional team of Dell engineers and sponsors who did a great job of installation. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/21d/2a8/0c6/21d2a80c61ff7c5483d607016d6f3260.png"><br><br>  Along with the vertical way of presenting information, a horizontal approach was used.  The most attentive probably noticed long ago that Dell uses four icons in visual communication.  It's time to talk about them for those who do not yet know. <br><br>  So, in order: <br><br>  1 <b>Transform</b> - transformation of data processing conditions at the expense of clouds, designed to accelerate the transition to cloud technologies;  Acceleration of virtualization, convergence and transition to cloud technologies <br><br>  2 <b>Inform</b> covers various aspects of data management in the implementation of VDI-projects;  Turning data into a valuable asset. <br><br>  3 <b>Protect</b> focuses on comprehensive data protection, IT infrastructure and information security solutions.  Providing comprehensive protection of IT infrastructure and its compliance with standards. <br><br>  4 <b>Connect</b> focuses on how to implement BYOD policy and maximize the benefits of using the BYOD model. <br><br>  <b>How it was?</b> <br><br>  The program of the Forum was divided into two parts.  First, Russian and foreign speakers from Dell talked about the cloud client computing technology developed by the company, presented the benefits of the DaaS model (Desktop as a service) and shared the main problems in organizing the work of mobile workers.  After that, representatives of Dell and participants from partner companies Intel, Microsoft, VMware, Citrix, IBS Platformix, Softline Raiffeisen Bank, Central Bank, Atlantis Computing, Red Hat, NVIDIA, CROC made presentations. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e63/238/9d5/e632389d5920ea5d7a2aaabe411fa635.jpg"><br><br>  At the very beginning, Boris Shcherbakov, CEO of Dell in Russia, welcomed all participants and noted that, being one of the hottest trends in the global IT market, workplace virtualization allows us to simplify, improve and secure work in various areas of human activity .  The relevance of virtualization solutions is confirmed in Russia, where many companies have already appreciated all the advantages of this technology. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fbe/139/1f3/fbe1391f389cbf814cea9e8485816c77.jpg"><br><br>  Then, after a welcoming speech and presentation, Dmitry Konash, regional director of Intel Corporation in the CIS countries, Jeff McNot, executive director of marketing and strategy for Dell, spoke about what tasks arise when creating a mobile workspace.  He noted that in the era of multi-de-organization, organizations should reconsider the approach to IT, taking into account the new trends in mobility of BYOD, socialization, virtualization and clouds.  Special attention was paid to the features of virtualization in various areas: financial, health, retail, educational. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3b8/b23/3e8/3b8b233e8b48fe2f59a660a225d5555c.jpg"><br><br>  So, Jeff gave an interesting example of virtualization of the hotel reservation service, when the management after issuing laptops to employees for work from home was faced with the fact that on the issued PC the employees' children put games and other software, and the employees themselves were not averse to having fun installing software taste.  This problem was solved with the help of thin clients, when all software was installed centrally and the user could not add it at his own discretion.  This radically changed the situation and also ensured higher reliability and control over the process.  Another interesting example in Jeff‚Äôs presentation was a medical facility in Florida (the speaker joked that if something happens, it happens in Florida), which used mobile computers with the funny name COWs (COWs - Computer on the wheels) to keep electronic records and patient records.  One day, one of these computers was gone, and a little later patient data appeared on the Internet.  Virtualization and thin clients help to cope with this situation, preventing possible data loss or hacking. <br><br>  After Jeff McNaught, Mike Devers, director of Dell Cloud Client Computing in the EMEA region, gave a presentation on the new era of flexible, secure, and managed virtual workplace infrastructure. <br><br>  Dell differs from other vendors by supplying complete integrated infrastructure solutions that will help organizations of any size do more and achieve their goals faster. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/862/f13/24e/862f1324e4f5e96d741b453dead2a615.jpg"><br><br>  We would like to pay special attention to the exhibition area, which demonstrated how virtualization technologies work using examples from companies from various industries: industry and oil and gas industry, education and healthcare, telecommunications and financial services.  In addition, within the exhibition area, one could become familiar with Dell PowerEdge server solutions for data centers, including the integrated Dell PowerEdge VRTX solution.  And on the isolated Dell PowerZone section, one could appreciate the speed and reliability of the Dell Wyse client equipment and software using typical demanding 3D, multimedia and entertainment applications. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/17e/ad1/672/17ead16728e73efba16887d737e67247.jpg"><br><br>  The forum included a press conference dedicated to Dell solutions for virtualization and the entry into the Russian market of new Dell PowerEdge R920 and R220 servers and the updated integrated infrastructure solution of Dell PowerEdge VRTX 1.3, which serve as the basis for desktop virtualization. <br><br>  <b>What topics discussed yet?</b> <br><br>  Nikolay Maymaev, Head of Dell Cloud Client Computing, made a presentation ‚ÄúMoving to a centralized workplace infrastructure with Dell‚Äù.  Stanislav Dobrochasov, the regional representative of Atlantis Computing, spoke about optimizing the level of data storage in the VDI infrastructure.  Sergey Martsynkyan, Windows Marketing Manager, M &amp; O Microsoft Russia, described the modern styles of working with Windows 8.1. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ff1/65d/faa/ff165dfaa6bed2c681f1d423f96abad6.jpg"><br><br>  And in your opinion, in what areas will virtualization be most in demand in Russian realities? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/220901/">https://habr.com/ru/post/220901/</a></p>
