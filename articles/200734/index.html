  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Growth Hacking: how to "crack" the problem of growth?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <b>The practice of growth hacking is gaining increasing popularity among startups.</b>  <b>But not all entrepreneurs know what this ‚Äúskill‚Äù is and how it can help their business.</b>  <b>In this post, we decided to answer this question in plain language.</b> <br><br>  <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_hacking">Growth hacking</a> is the search and use of solutions that promote the growth of the popularity of a new service, product or startup that is just entering the market.  It is with their help, many startups in the short term receive the explosive growth of users or resource attendance. <br><br>  Growth hackers are the best internet marketers and product managers of Silicon Valley.  Specialists such as <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/noahkagan">Noah Kagan</a> , <a href="http://500.co/mentors/mike-greenfield/">Mike Greenfiel</a> , <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/davemcclure">Dave McClure</a> became the pioneers of new methods, starting from traditional viral marketing, e-mail, and SEO.  It is believed that, unlike conventional marketers, growth hackers do not practice traditional approaches, but use non-standard methods or techniques that allow us to achieve an avalanche-like increase in the number of users of the product.  Such practices are particularly relevant against the background of the withering away of the traditional marketing model, the tremendous growth of information and the inability of even well-made products to reach consumers.  And also in the conditions of the fact that distribution and its channels become the number one problem for high-tech products. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/efc/907/4c7/efc9074c7e212a1ec9738fd414ba1a0c.png" alt="image">

      There are several classic examples of the fact that, thanks to growth hackers, new products have gained a customer base from zero to millions in a very short time.  One of the most impressive is the case of the <a href="http://www.hotmail.com/">Hotmail</a> mail service.  After the launch, the creators and managers proposed a growth strategy, which was to buy advertising on boards and radio.  But investor <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/tim-draper/0/86/957">Timothy Draper</a> had a better idea.  Automatically add message ‚ÄúPS: I Love You.  Get Your Free Email at Hotmail ‚Äùin the body of each message.  The creators of the service agreed to add a signature, leaving only part of the phrase, without "PS: I Love You."  After that, each customer service has become his unwitting seller.  The effect was immediate, and the growth of users was explosive - 3,000 people were registered per day.  For 18 months at the initial stage of work, the mailer gained 12 million users, and subsequently was acquired by Microsoft for $ 400 million. <br><br>  Another classic growth hacking example is attracting traffic to a new resource from an already-promoted platform with a gigantic audience.  This method was used by <a href="http://www.paypal.com/">PayPal</a> marketers as a platform by choosing <a href="http://www.ebay.com/">eBay</a> online auction.  Its essence was that eBay sellers could automatically add the payment system logo down their auction list (auction listings). <br><br>  Could not do without hacking growth and great <a href="http://facebook.com/">Facebook</a> .  When this service was at an early stage of development, management created a special team within the company led by a growth hacker who interacted with various services.  This team was responsible for making Facebook available in all languages ‚Äã‚Äãusing crowdsourcing, as well as enabling social network users to import email addresses from other services. <br><br>  A series of interactive workshops will be held at the <a href="http://venturesummit.eu/">Startup AddVenture</a> conference, which will be held in Kiev on December 4-5.  One of them will be dedicated specifically to the direction of growth hacking.  The participants of the workshop, led by recognized growth hackers, will be looking for effective marketing techniques to quickly turn a startup into a successful business.  The group will include entrepreneurs and developers, who will be provided with 2 hours of intensive work with growth hackers. <br><br>  It is planned that 100 people will participate in the section, who will be divided into 10 teams.  During the event, each of them will work together on growth hacking cases.  Participants will be able to answer basic questions of the project‚Äôs marketing development.  For example, where to look for traffic, how to turn it into customers, and how to force visitors to return.  In addition to obtaining new practical skills and theoretical knowledge, participants will be able to get expertise from growth hackers to develop their own projects. <br><br>  Participation in the project will be real experts in the field of growth hacking: <br><ul><li>  Marvin <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/marvin-liao/0/5/630">Liao</a> is an experienced technology expert who launches products and services in the global markets of Asia, Europe, Latin America and the USA.
