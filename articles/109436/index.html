  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Use transport reasonably !?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> <a href="http://podorozhniki.com/"><img src="http://img97.imageshack.us/img97/2003/logomain.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br>  I just want to say with an advertising slogan like: ‚Äúthe <a href="http://podorozhniki.com/">search for travel companions is podorozhniki.com</a> ‚Äù.  But for such a review of our startup, probably would have received a ban post.  I will not risk it and will talk about everything in order, trying not to take too much time from you. <br>  We launched our startup, which was fed for almost half a year by our nerves, sleepless nights, knowledge, and of course inspiration and thoughts about a bright and bright future.  Post about the project has already been on <a href="http://lifehacker.ru/2010/12/02/ispolzuem-transport-razumno/">lifehacker.ru</a> .  I offer you an extended review. <br>  Podorozhniki.com is a global and convenient carpool (carsharing) service that allows you to efficiently and wisely use transport, bringing together drivers and passengers along the way.  The service is perfect for trips around the city, as well as for trips between cities and countries.  Works wherever there is a Google Maps coverage (in the future there will be Yandex maps). <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Service tasks are simple and clear: <br>  1. reduce the load on the urban transport systems - combating traffic jams, <br>  2. promote the reduction of CO2 emissions into the atmosphere, <br>  3. to reduce the cost of drivers for fuel (fuel costs may be partially or fully covered by passengers-companions), <br>  4. allow passengers to transfer from crowded public transport to a comfortable car at almost the same cost. <br>  In general, we hope <a href="http://podorozhniki.com/">podorozhniki.com</a> sooner or later will help each of you make your life a little easier and more pleasant.  Drivers who drive the same routes every day can also alternate, acting as a driver in turn. <br>  In the megacities of China, by the way, carpool is already one of the main ways to combat traffic.  In the US, separate lanes for drivers with travel companions.  In Europe, a car-sharing boom also begins, which has been stimulated, including the famous Eyyafyatlayokudl.  Then the Italian car sharing service registered up to 17,000 users per day! <br>  But in truth, very many would agree with the fact that in most cases it is simply not reasonable to drive more than a hundred horsepower for one person over and over again.  And, in general, in the world it is already a trend - to use everything rationally and rationally, including transport. <br><br>  In general, everything is simple and convenient: <br> <a href="http://podorozhniki.com/"><img src="http://img834.imageshack.us/img834/6655/40039552.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br>  signed up, created my own routes and clicked search.  If companions are not immediately found, then as soon as they appear, the system will notify you by email, and the companions themselves will get to your section ‚ÄúWe are on the way‚Äù.  You can also contact and arrange joint travel. <br>  Creating routes is easy.  All the user needs is to go to the ‚ÄúCreate + Find‚Äù section: <br>  1. Indicate who you are - the driver or passenger <br>  2. Indicate the beginning and end of the route or mark it on the map <br>  3. Specify details of the route (days of the week, time, comments) <br> <a href="http://podorozhniki.com/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/aa7/fb3/0f1/aa7fb30f1ff5309cc025b80f5f184869.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br>  Next, the system will analyze the route and display a list of the most suitable companions, or, as I have already mentioned, notify by email as soon as they appear. <br>  The feature of the service is that everything works on the basis of the Google Maps API (in the near future there will be a choice between Google and Yandex maps), and the routes are analyzed precisely by the coordinates of the curves.  We (by the way, graduates of the fur-mat) did their best to ensure that the search was truly intellectual and effective.  And, apparently, we succeeded.  Our algorithms and formulas for analyzing curves do their job exactly as you expect from them.  Thank you, fur mat))! <br>  In general, the search for a companion is always accurate and correct.  And no matter how the user called the beginning and end of their route.  The system will always unmistakably find a companion, even if it travels from a neighboring block or street (or even a city for long journeys), and its route is only partially similar to yours, but you are still on the way.  In general, check.  The service is quite young, but the routes are no few, especially in Moscow and Kiev.  Already hundreds of users have found real companions for regular and one-time trips.  This makes us very happy, because  the service already brings real benefits to society. <br>  The only thing worth noting is that for drivers the routes in Russia <b>are</b> not yet laid out automatically, with the exception of Moscow and the region.  But for this we have implemented the possibility of laying routes in manual mode, and this does not affect the quality of the search for travel companions. <br><br>  Every day we work on improving and optimizing.  There is still a lot of interesting things ahead. <br>  Already in the development of an application for social networks and mobile platforms in order to make the service interactive and truly alive: I went out on the street, stuck it on the map in the phone where you need it and immediately see who is traveling along the same route and can you toss.  But this really works effectively only when the service becomes really massively used. <br>  So welcome!
