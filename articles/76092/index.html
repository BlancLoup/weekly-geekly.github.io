And despite all the efforts of managers, trips to exhibitions, attempts to develop new sales channels, the number of customers is sharply reduced.  Someone survives providing an account for old customers, someone enters international markets, but practice shows that the market is stagnating. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  From the point of view of the customer, the situation on the market of production sites resembles an attempt to catch a taxi in the middle of the night in the center of Moscow - cars to the voting customer are lining up, but having learned the price that the customer can offer during the crisis - they refuse him and continue to rush around the city in search of customers with a big wallet.

      Similarly, most large studios offer customers prices that are justified by high margins, sifting out most of the mid-level customers. <br><br>  It was these prerequisites that made us think about the organization of a low cost manufacturer of high-quality websites. <br><br>  Allow me to submit: low cost site developer <a href="http://giperbaton.ru/">giperbaton.ru</a> <br><br><h4>  Ideology: </h4>  HyperBaton is a literary word, a synonym for the term " <i>anaphora</i> " - meaningful change in the places of words in a sentence.  Remember Master Yoda?  " <i>We need to knock down these starships</i> " - this is a hyperbaton. <br><br>  If you have ever flown low-cost airlines, then it will be very easy to understand the ideology of HyperBaton in our work with customers. <br><br>  For example, the renair airline discounter prohibits employees from charging mobile phones in the office, airports where the company's fleet is located are far from large settlements, your departure is likely to be in the middle of the night, and you will not be fed on board a plane.  But with the help of renair, you will receive the main thing - transportation from point A to point B at the lowest price. <br>  Well, or buying furniture for IKEA, you will most likely have to take the boxes home by yourself.  However, you are ready for this, because you get the main thing - quality furniture at a low price. <br><br>  <b>Due to what do these companies live?</b>  - Due to turnover. <br><br>  In pursuit of high margins, most developers are aiming at big business, surviving from a major contract to an equally large contract due to ‚Äúaccumulated stocks‚Äù.  And customers of medium and not large level pass by. <br><br>  It is because working with HyperBaton we: <br><ul><li>  We will not invite you to the Moscow office, as it is completely virtual.  All calls to the studio are forwarded to managers. </li><li>  we carry out all development outside of Moscow - more than 15 studio developers, forming 4 project teams, work in St. Petersburg </li><li>  We pay special attention to the technical specifications and the prototype, which are performed for each site, which guarantees punctual and consistent design of the project. </li></ul><br><h4>  Growth strategy </h4><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1965310/GiperActive.png" alt="Giperactive"><br>  This is an interesting thing - if the number of high-budget customers falls, as a result, the demand for sites with prices ranging from 40,000 to 150,000 rubles increases.  Amazingly, this market niche is free. <br>  Studios, which in the conditions of the prevailing conjuncture will succeed in taking a ‚Äúvacating place‚Äù, will dictate the conditions in the market in the near future.  However, you can grow not only in your niche, by diversifying production.  For example, savings.  Recently, we realized that advertising on the network remains a new and very interesting area for us - and we did a new startup under the umbrella brand giper, the advertising agency giper active.  <a href="http://giperactive.ru/">giperactive.ru</a> <br><br><h4>  Epatage </h4>  Work should be fun.  And how great that our work allows us to self-actualize. <br>  Going to our site, the customer will not see the beaten-up words <i>media</i> , <i>interactive</i> , or God forbid <i>solutions</i> .  We meet you with a bread of titanic sizes. <br>  Also, working on each individual project, we try to make every effort to distinguish it from the competitors, to implement the most unusual (and sometimes crazy in general) ideas. <br><br>  Although working in a niche of low cost sites is fraught with a large number of difficulties, however, if your goal is a good and high-quality result, let's make this market better than it is. <br><br>  Kiss, <br>  sincerely yours, <br>  team studio HyperBaton <br>  <a href="http://giperbaton.ru/">giperbaton.ru</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/76092/">https://habr.com/ru/post/76092/</a></p>
