Well, firstly, the exhibition area has become less.  Monsters of the gaming industry have agreed with the organizers of the event that ordinary people did not disperse to any nonsense (as in that joke: Here's 100 bucks for you and do not distract God with your petty requests). <br><br> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zhikharev/4737634249/" title="Money box $ -) by zhikharev, on Flickr"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b14/ed8/639/b14ed86398fc49f1785b742ee0d0ed58.jpg" width="333" height="500" alt="Money box $ -)"></a> <br>  In this connection, the cost of participation has increased ... <br><br> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zhikharev/4737634373/" title="Mafia II ads by zhikharev, on Flickr"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/161/812/6d6/1618126d62cfb86e8243aa266e93258d.jpg" width="500" height="396" alt="Mafia II ads"></a> <br>  ... and the competition has tightened. <br><br> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zhikharev/4738268678/" title="Armored vehicle by zhikharev, on Flickr"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/dd3/e27/853/dd3e278537cd72207b72e2e3f7fcf8e5.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="Armored vehicle"></a> <br><br>  Many stands were located directly on the street.  And, as it seems to me, it was much more reasonable to exhibit under the open sky.

To smell the money coming from the shops of large igrodelov. <br><br>  As the organizers of the <a href="http://bit.ly/9uin1l">International Game and Film Lounge</a> assume <a href="http://bit.ly/9uin1l">,</a> more will continue.  The largest film companies have long been planning how to increase the profit from the brand through games.  Looks like the toys in Happy are no longer delivered.  On the last panel, a solution to the problem was discussed, but my colleague and I did not see it through and left. <br><br><h4>  Onlive, Gaikai &amp; Game Streamer </h4><br><br> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zhikharev/4738272474/" title="Onlive by zhikharev, on Flickr"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/83f/775/839/83f775839d6bcd180e5bce781764398e.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="Onlive"></a> <br><br>  If you are interested in trends, here is one of them.  Soon and the games will be <a href="http://bit.ly/brXqja">in the cloud.</a>  Europe, and even more so Russia is not waiting for it soon, but in the states they promise to launch the service just about. <br><br> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zhikharev/4738272628/" title="Onlive by zhikharev, on Flickr"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9aa/8ca/9bb/9aa8ca9bb7def1458e845fd3fa87fdb6.jpg" width="278" height="500" alt="Onlive"></a> <br>  Play Crysis at maximum settings on iPad?  Easy! * "Try it yourself" - offers a smiling young man in an orange polo. <br><br>  * <i>In fact, gentlemen are cunning.</i>  <i>It is one thing to watch live video in FullHD format, and quite another to control this video.</i>  <i>The magnitude of the delay is multiplied by only 2, and the indignation that your character did not have time to react and dodge the rocket rushes to infinity.</i>  <i>The exhibition demonstration, of course, is held on a local server, which is hidden in the rack, less than a meter and a half from you.</i> <br><br> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zhikharev/4738272376/" title="Onlive lounge by zhikharev, on Flickr"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/de0/fd5/39d/de0fd539d64cedeb020709a34ebb89d6.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="Onlive lounge"></a> <br><br>  But it is not all that bad.  The success of this business model is inevitable.  This is confirmed by the fact that <a href="http://onlive.com/">Onlive</a> already has competitors.  And not even one! <br><br>  <a href="http://www.gaikai.com/">Gaikai</a> positions itself not only as a ‚Äúgame in the clouds‚Äù service, but something more.  The creators propose to use technology with business benefits.  The presentation on the main page of their site as if tells us: ‚ÄúLook how simple it is: 1) clicked 2) tried 3) bought it.  Instantly! ‚ÄùWith Gaikai, plus data centers in all of the US are being built, while Onlive has one. <br><br>  To understand how important and valuable I will make a small lyrical digression. <br><blockquote>  In May of this year, I traveled to <a href="http://bit.ly/dsk2ub">LOGIN Conference</a> in Seattle with a report.  This is a conference on games of a rather broad direction.  Rather authoritative in the gaming community (something like a sectoral <a href="http://bit.ly/b37KtN">TED</a> ) Few people know about LOGIN from those who are not involved in the gaming industry, because 3‚Äì4 people organize it without any media support.  But, despite this, quite dear people come there.  For example, <a href="http://www.dperry.com/">David Perry</a> is a gaming industry veteran and CEO of Gaikai. <br><br>  Well, at this conference, only lazy did not say that the future belongs to those who can minimize the "friction" (the effort of potential buyers) on the way to conversion. <br>  <i>Example:</i> Apple made their own app store.  All his registered users have tied their plastic card to the account and therefore the purchase for them takes place in 1 click.  Those.  clicked "buy" and that's it.  Money written off.  There is no turning back :-) <br>  <i>Anti-example:</i> To install a trial (!) Version of Supreme Commander 2, you must perform about 40 clicks and wait an unrealistic long time (install Steam, create an account, confirm email, download a game, install ...) <br><br>  With such gigantic differences in convenience and ease of access, the quality of the product begins to fade into the background.  The one who wins is easier to buy.  And if you can also see the demo before you buy it, then everything is your client.  In the west, people are used to value their time more than money. <br></blockquote><br><br> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zhikharev/4738272950/" title="GameStreemer by zhikharev, on Flickr"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1fe/06d/21d/1fe06d21d57431224f3264dac88ca274.jpg" width="500" height="322" alt="Gamestreemer"></a> <br><br>  About the Game Streamer has not yet said.  So, they also plan to launch the service "games from the cloud" with blackjack.  The date I was named was Q4 / 2010.  And now they have a digital distribution platform a la Steam, but according to a white label.  So, if you are going to do digital distribution in Russia in the near future, keep in mind. <br><br><h4>  Prefixes </h4><br> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zhikharev/4737636879/" title="Xbox mount by zhikharev, on Flickr"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/baf/dd4/dfb/bafdd4dfb727669efb1f0008b2d0f37b.jpg" width="500" height="323" alt="Xbox mount"></a> <br><br> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zhikharev/4738271354/" title="Xbox accessories by zhikharev, on Flickr"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b23/0de/134/b230de134c9190bafadf385bee35ee83.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="Xbox accessories"></a> <br>  Here, without me, everything was told and retold.
