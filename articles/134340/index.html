  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Petersburg startup: media and an online catalog for parents, building an effective platform for web promotion</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello, Habr! <br><br>  We are very happy to be among our colleagues.  KidsReview.ru is an officially registered online media and one-and-a-half year old startup that does not sell children's products or services.  Our service is informational, and it is aimed at the family: not only children and parents, but also uncles with aunts, grandparents, brothers and sisters ‚Äî all who lead an active lifestyle on the Internet and offline. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe project is simple: the dense interweaving of the original author's content - a manually moderated <a href="http://www.kidsreview.ru/catalog">catalog of companies</a> , a <a href="http://www.kidsreview.ru/afisha/events">daily poster</a> and a professional <a href="http://www.kidsreview.ru/journal">online magazine</a> - makes it possible to cover a wide range of Internet search queries with reference to a specific region.  The complete absence of aggressive, ambiguous or imposed content (including banners), independence and information content of materials (including photos and videos), as well as easy navigation through the site help to build a high-quality brand and a positive image of the resource in the eyes of readers (consumers) and companies (service providers).

      As a result, KidsReview.ru becomes a democratic and natural meeting place for supply and demand in the field of goods and services for families with children.  Readers easily find what they need, and companies (both large and small) can convey information about themselves to the target consumer. <br><br>  The monetization model is also simple: not only the head and a few ‚Äútop‚Äù ones can ‚Äúearn‚Äù, but each of the tens of thousands of internal pages of the site.  In practice, the model was confirmed: with current attendance of about 150,000 unique readers per month, only 3% of the views fall on the main page of the site.  The vast majority of users are ready to purchase and come to KidsReview.ru for information about a particular product or service.  For almost 4 minutes, readers, on average, look through 3 pages and actively share information with relatives through social networking mechanisms. <br><br>  What are our difficulties?  Firstly, we are constantly fighting for usability.  The child-parent theme is often misinterpreted even by designers - we constantly have to give up pink bows, cute cats and other non-functional interface elements.  We are constantly working to simplify the navigation and search of site materials. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ade/af2/b71/adeaf2b71366152590c6c4341c2e24d7.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Secondly, with the high and constantly growing Internet activity of consumers, we are faced with a blatant Internet illiteracy of representatives of most service providers.  Well, i.e.  we knew that not all companies have their own regularly updated websites and that sometimes regional workers find it difficult to work with corporate websites that are managed from Moscow.  We knew that for many companies the VKontakte group is a corporate website, and the distribution of paper leaflets on the corner is the most understandable way to promote.  But we were still not ready for the fact that 95% of organizations (including state theaters, museums and educational institutions) have ‚Äúofficial‚Äù mailboxes on <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/mail/" class="user_link">mail</a> .ru, <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/yandex/" class="user_link">yandex</a> .ru and sometimes <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/gmail/" class="user_link">gmail</a> .com.  What is there to say - many executives of companies in general ‚ÄúInternet‚Äù are afraid and either do not go there at all, or keep with them special ‚ÄúInternet translators‚Äù who both write emails and check publications. <br><br>  Thirdly, some of those companies that are able and not afraid to use the Internet, by all means want to replace our neutral editorial texts with their advertising. <br><br>  Comments (not requiring registration) also turned out to be a significant problem: some companies try to use them for simple self-praise, others to denigrate competitors, and still others are ready to threaten our editors with physical violence and demand removal of negative reviews instead of meaningful work with offended customers. <br><br>  However, no matter how ‚Äúraw‚Äù the market for goods and services for families is, it is huge.  About 1 million children live in St. Petersburg and Leningrad region alone, most of them in families that are consumers of many goods and services.  According to experts, only the Russian market of clothes for children is more than 5 billion euros!  So KidsReview.ru is gradually preparing to enter the regions, and this is a completely different and interesting task :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/134340/">https://habr.com/ru/post/134340/</a></p>
