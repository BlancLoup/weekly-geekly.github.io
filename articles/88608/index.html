What to choose?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In the process of developing a rather interesting project for a travel company, it became necessary to integrate one of the payment systems on the site so that site users could pay for their own orders without any problems and restrictions. <br><br>  So, the task is rather trivial, and I began to solve it by studying the subject area. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  We have a small travel company (who cares: <a href="http://www.go-baikal.ru/">www.go-baikal.ru</a> ).  It is necessary that the user has the opportunity to pay orders, regardless of the type of electronic currency / credit card (acquiring).

      The main players of this type of activity on the territory of our country were considered.  In addition to the above criterion, several important criteria were of interest: the amount of the transfer fee (range and what influences the percentage), how long they connect (range by the number of days) and from which year the payment system exists (this is also quite important).  At the exit, I got the following sign: <br><br><table><tbody><tr><td>  <strong>system name</strong> </td><td>  <strong>fee for transfer (range and what affects the percentage)</strong> </td><td>  <strong>how long to connect (range by number of days)</strong> </td><td>  <strong>from which year does it exist</strong> </td></tr><tr><td>  <a href="http://www.z-payment.ru/">Z-Payment</a> </td><td>  The tariff table is available at the following address: <a href="https://z-payment.ru/tarifs.php">z-payment.ru/tarifs.php</a> <br><br>  Store Certificate - Issued to a representative of a legal entity that has entered into an agreement with the guarantor and the system operator - TRANSACTOR LLC.  It has all rights to use the system with additional opportunities for legal entities. " </td><td>  From 5 days </td><td>  Year 2003 </td></tr><tr><td>  <a href="http://www.chronopay.com/">Chronopay</a> </td><td>  The commission depends on several factors: the specifics of the business (that is, what goods and / or services you sell), the type of payments that you intend to accept, the pace of your online business, and the working environment of the acquiring bank in which you will have an account (Interet Merchant Account). <br><br>  An example, found somewhere on the Internet (yes, the random author will forgive me): Cronopay 1.2% -1.5% plus Fixed 8.1rub for each transaction. <br>  UCS ~ 3% (acquiring) <br><br>  Plus subscriber chronopea 2400r / month on the back of &lt;300.000rub / month. <br><br>  Total, in my case, approximately 4.5% + 8.1 rubles per transaction, plus 2400 rubles a subscriber.  On the one hand, it is a little expensive, on the other hand, it‚Äôs your merchant, and the money is in rubles in a bank account.  You pay VAT and you are not fooled about anything. <br><br>  By electronic money it turns out like this: <br><br>  - webmoney 3% <br>  - Yandex 4% </td><td>  ~ from 15 days </td><td>  Year 2003 </td></tr><tr><td>  <a href="http://www.cyberplat.ru/">Cyberplat</a> </td><td>  To connect to the CyberPlat system you need to install the software "" Shop - Calculations "" <br><br>  Enrollment of Buyers' payments to the Store, as a legal entity, can be made in two ways: <br>  To a transit account with Platina Bank, with subsequent transfer to the bank servicing the Store <br>  To the account of the Store opened with Platina Bank <br><br>  The fee for registering a store in the system is $ 100 (in ruble equivalent at the exchange rate of the Central Bank at the date of calculation). <br><br>  About the internal commission - personally. </td><td>  Within 30 days </td><td>  1997 </td></tr><tr><td>  <a href="http://assist.ru/">Assist</a> </td><td>  The cost of connecting the store to the system depends on which bank of the ASSIST store the contract is concluded with. <br><br>  To receive payments by electronic cash, the cost of connecting to <br>  the system is free.  The contract must be concluded with KIT Finance Investment Bank (OJSC).  Commission: Yandex.Money - 5%, WebMoney - 4%, Mobile Payment Beeline - 4%.  You can connect to one or more selected wallets. <br><br>  The ASSIST Bank charges the following fees for credit card payments: <br>  Connection to the system - 100-180 cu  in ruble equivalent, depending on the selected ASSIST bank.  This amount includes registration of an outlet in payment systems (VISA, Europay) <br>  The commission for transactions is 3-5% of the payment amount (recorded in the agreement with the bank of the ASSIST system).  It is set depending on the type of business of the store and the volume of payments. <br>  The subscription fee is not charged, the calculations are made within 3-5 days from the date of authorization. <br>  In some cases, a security deposit is required from the store.  Its value is determined by the corresponding bank of the ASSIST system. </td><td>  From 5 days </td><td>  1998 </td></tr><tr><td>  <a href="http://www.payonlinesystem.ru/">Payonline system</a> </td><td>  The commission charged by our company is determined individually and depends on many factors, the main of which are: <br>  The specifics and type of your business (the sale of any goods and the provision of any services you provide); <br>  Turnovers of your online business; <br>  The working conditions of the partner bank that will process the transactions. <br>  To calculate the commission, we recommend that you use the Calculator service (http://www.payonlinesystem.ru/request/calc/). </td><td>  From 5 days </td><td>  2008 </td></tr><tr><td>  <a href="http://robokassa.ru/">ROBOKASSA</a> </td><td>  Connection and subscription fees are NOT charged.  There is also no minimum transaction volume that should go through your ROBOKASS. <br>  Work with legal entities implies our agency fee, which is 5% of the amount of all payments received.  It does not matter which payment method the client chooses - electronic money, sms, bank cards or instant payment terminal.  We take into account all the funds received at your address and send them to your bank account at regular intervals. <br><br>  The buyer can pay for the purchase without commission in the following ways: <br>  Webmoney (WMR, WMZ) <br>  Yandex money <br>  Moneymail <br>  Wallet One <br>  Webcreds <br>  PayExpress <br>  In contact with <br><br>  Also, no commission can be paid in the terminals QIWI and bank cards. <br><br>  The buyer pays only the purchase price indicated on the store's website.  The remaining electronic money is accepted with a commission for conversion (on average, it is 4-5%).  The client will see the current conversion rates in the form of payment before making a transaction. <br><br>  <a href="http://robokassa.ru/Tariff.aspx">robokassa.ru/Tariff.aspx</a> </td><td>  From 3 days </td><td>  Roboxchange.com began operating in 2002 </td></tr></tbody></table><br>  The result was a rather interesting selection suitable for further analysis. <br><br>  As for the commission, I would like to additionally note that only averaged data are presented on the system sites, more specific information (commission size, remuneration) is established after personal contact with the PS manager.  I will definitely write about the results of these contacts in the next post, but for the time being, the question to the users will be to comment on and, if possible, complete this table. <br><br>  Thank. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/88608/">https://habr.com/ru/post/88608/</a></p>
