Many questions were asked on the type of "where to read" and "where to start."  I bring to your attention a selection of literature, resources for a confident start in this area. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Books </h4><br><h5>  A.A.  Barseghyan, M.S.  Kupriyanov, V.V.  Stepanenko, I.I.
