The topic, to put it mildly, contains a certain amount of inaccuracies, and if to put it bluntly - a nehily portion of frank pesdezh and demagogy! <br><br>  Why deliberately powder people's brains and divide them into favorites / non-elected / IT managers / managers / startups?

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><blockquote>  I tracked what they write about a month, then decided and registered. <br><br>  Karma to get it turned out pretty quickly, <strong>thanks to some knowledge of psychology and the ability to adapt to the mood of the majority.</strong>  As soon as he expressed his real opinions, karma dropped very quickly. <br></blockquote><br>  Noticeable! <br><br><blockquote>  Today, with perplexity, I read topics about the ‚Äúsuper-scrammer‚Äù.  For me somehow, Ponte is not very interesting in the form of karma, chosenness and other snobbery.  But. <br></blockquote><br>  As already mentioned, no boast, chosenness and snobbery, this is beta testing! <br><br><blockquote>  Under the cut - a lot of unpleasant, but honestly <br></blockquote><br>  There are many unpleasant things, but to say that it is fair, my language would not have turned. <br><br><blockquote>  UPD.  And it's not about the "super gab".  And about the other. <br></blockquote><br>  About what? <br><br><blockquote>  As I understand it, initially this project was purely IT-shny.  Very good. <br><br>  Then came those who knew how to cut cabbage on the sale of half-baked ‚Äústart-ups‚Äù.  Another caste has appeared - ‚Äústartups‚Äù, these are some kind of lemming that are not plagued by Google‚Äôs laurels.  They idolize VKontakte and other ‚Äústart-ups‚Äù, often without realizing that 90 percent of them are skomunyzdereznye western projects.  They scribble posts "stop working for your uncle" and revel in some kind of "freedom." <br><br>  Then the managers came here.  These are those who wanted to see how their subordinates live, to catch trends, so to speak.  Some of them started writing posts, and very good ones, by the way.  And during ‚Äústop plowing for uncle‚Äù they raised an answer ‚Äúfor uncle pahat is cool‚Äù. <br><br>  All this gang has long been out of the definition of IT.  And it was precisely this that attracted me to the resource.  In contrast to the gloomy long-haired Snuffles, managers and start-ups are expressing bolder, more promising, often ingenious thoughts.  For me, this is precisely what Habr is worth.  <strong>And if all IT shniki go to the "supergab"</strong> - nothing I, personally, I will not lose.  As for sure half of habrayuzerov. <br></blockquote><br>  Omit generalizations about users and other tinsel.  Fact: no one is going to leave anywhere, <strong>Habrahabr and Supergab is one project!</strong> <br><br><blockquote>  But here's the catch.  The old guard with inflated karma and "transcendental" authority has long ago become numb, as the audience of the EZHE-list (yes, I signed there, only the spam of these perduns is not interesting to read), and does not understand that times are changing, here came those who wants to chat. <br></blockquote><br>  No comments! <br><br><blockquote>  I am very glad that the creators of Habr began to slowly spread the audience in the corners.  Differentiate it.  Flesh out  Well, etc.  And yet all these encroachments perfectly show who is an idiot, and who is normal and adequate. <br><br>  Thank you, UFO, you are doing the right thing. <br><br>  Thanks if you read it. <br><br>  Ps.  UFO flew in and deleted postscript <br><br>  UPD.  I agree that the language is ambiguous.  But please do not take everything personally and close to your heart. <br></blockquote><br>  Nobody divorces anyone in the corners, does not differentiate, does not concretize the audience, no one shows who is an idiot and who is normal! <br><br>  There are no content topics on the super gab!  Only testing! <br><br>  Well, what about the bottom line, the opinion? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/24793/">https://habr.com/ru/post/24793/</a></p>
