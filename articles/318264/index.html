Again. <br><br>  Growth to 850 and above.  And I got a profit (about 10-16 thousand rubles from a cue ball - I bought differently, but from 37,000 rubles for a crypto coin).  And therefore - again disappointed: yes, I am not a billionaire investor;  Yes, for me - this is not the main income of life.  But precisely because in btc laid unthinkable growth.  And most importantly - speculation.

      Recall that the coins in ‚Äúdigital gold‚Äù are limited in terms of emissions: it would seem, here it is - a means of inflation, which was once invented in order to avoid large-scale disruptions of the economy like the Great Depression. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>But what really?</b> <br><br>  In practice: <br><br><ul><li>  <b>The same speculation and at the same time</b> - and huge fluctuations, where the gap even in the $ 100 does not seem something out of the ordinary.  To compare, say, with very liquid stocks of Sberbank of the Russian Federation is enough to understand what it is about. </li><li>  <b>The same approach</b> , according to which bit investment is gold, which is not so necessary, especially in the context of the mining process, which is now far from real mines and labor. </li><li>  <b>The same tools</b> : stock exchanges, exchange offices, guarantors ... </li></ul><br>  In short: the essence has not changed.  Yes, they came up with a good technology.  Yes, they gave her value.  Yes, they created a community.  But the most important thing is the principles: here they remain the same. <br><br>  Yes, this is a controversial issue and everyone decides it in his own way: but this very answer confirms once again that nothing has changed in society yet.  There were fluctuations, and the result was exactly the same. <br><br>  <b>Bitcoin replaced [a] dollar</b> .  Is this already a lot?  Maybe.  But still, this is about something else: I would call it the ‚Äúpsychology of start-ups‚Äù, when up to 1,000,000,000 can grow in a year.  Or two.  Or even three.  But it‚Äôs impossible to go this way in 100 years! <br><br>  This approach has been systematically killing the Planet for a long time (since not anyone noticed it, but R. Branson, surely something is wrong?);  because of this position, whole countries were discarded for years and even decades ago in 2008, 1997-1998 (can be continued);  Because of this approach, we firmly believe in S. Jobs, who wanted to spit on friends, on the use of child labor in creating favorite gadgets (which, by the way, his own children were deliberately deprived for the most part), and quite specifically named in the huge -tome biography and famous book - mu ... com. <br><br>  Around (you can even read the file Habra) - a lot of talk about the fact that money is the goal, but a means.  But as soon as it comes to what is said above, we immediately turn to the promise: ‚Äúwhat have you achieved?‚Äù.  By the way, the answer really does not interest anyone if you are not an investor or a famous businessman. <br><br>  <b>Paradox.</b>  <b>Absurd.</b>  <b>Aporia even.</b> <br><br>  But all these fabrications have quite specific promises: <br><br><ol><li>  changing the form, but not changing the content - we get one more step in the process of consumption, not recovery. </li><li>  using old tools in new approaches - we risk the most possible destruction of the very essence of the innovation. </li><li>  the movement of the market itself as a mass unconscious is, again, from an era gone by when a person lived, submitting to reactions but not influencing them. </li></ol><br>  Yes, all of this is one of more than seven billion fears.  One whose opinion is far from the mass authority.  But let it be better expressed than once again I will look at how a bright idea dies to the thunder of applause. <br><br>  <b>PS</b> It was a good attempt: until it became a mass.  But it is precisely the mass can bring it to the point of absurdity and even - to modernize. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/318264/">https://habr.com/ru/post/318264/</a></p>
