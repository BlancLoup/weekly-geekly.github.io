  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Lexand Callisto Review: Navigator Smartphone</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> Up until now, the Lexand brand has been strongly associated with navigators and registrars.  In these directions, the dynamics of the brand is preserved: a good line of GPS ‚Äúguides‚Äù on Android has appeared, and among ‚Äúvideo witnesses‚Äù, Lexand LR-4500 has earned its hit status.  Now, Lexand is clearly seeking to ‚Äúumbrella‚Äù heights - an example of this is the recent pair of routers-batteries and a mobile router.  Now we face the first smartphone of the brand - Lexand Callisto. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/140/56b/754/14056b754f3ceadb1523d96adb6bba96.jpg"><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  First you need to put some accents.  Lexand Callisto is not a flagship product.  Best of all, the niche model is characterized by a 5-inch WVGA-screen and support for two SIM-cards.  As well as the processor MediaTek MT6577.  The device is worth 7,990 rubles.  Therefore, the first step is to find out what retail in the face of Yandex.Market thinks about the competitiveness of the new product.  According to the specified key characteristics, <a href="">one and</a> a <a href="">half pages of models</a> are issued.  And I somehow can not say that in terms of price and characteristics, Lexand Callisto is inferior to competitors (well, or it looks unnecessarily expensive).  In general, the device for its category is not without interest - for the sake of we proceed to a detailed study.

      <b>Package and package</b> <br><br>  The device is delivered in laconic black packaging.  Very, it should be noted, weighty - affect the weight parameters of the "object". <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/99e/ecf/446/99eecf446f442f54bd15f32f450db475.jpg"><br><br>  Cable - charger - headset - it makes no sense to dwell on these moments.  There is - yes and good.  The headset will still have to change to something more decent. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1ed/528/dbe/1ed528dbed288534e7c6beca41f4db62.jpg"><br><br>  Before moving on to the main ‚Äútrick‚Äù of the kit, I‚Äôll say a few words about the competent glossy ‚Äúguide‚Äù.  The fact is that Lexand sees its audience not among the ‚Äúgeeks‚Äù, because the brand has provided its new product with a rather detailed guide on Android.  It is to us, habrakhabrovchanam, to no avail, but Lexand care about the "kettles" is visible to the naked eye. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a44/bdb/2f8/a44bdb2f8bbb2372f4dd4e6c7e3beb8c.jpg"><br><br>  So, about the "chip."  Comes with a book case, not quite normal.  The design of ‚Äúclothes‚Äù is made in the form of a back cover with a fastened side to protect the screen.  It turns out, on the one hand, we immediately get a cover, and on the other - it seems like there is a spare cover on hand.  Such an accessory exists, for example, for the Samsung Galaxy S4 - the idea and design coincide almost completely. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/fd9/87f/118/fd987f1182308f3879787423dadf59c6.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/448/a2a/011/448a2a011b73edffa7e37555ff7831d1.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/128/ab3/b86/128ab3b8607b8d4337579af3b5c32b6e.jpg"><br><br>  The minus of the ‚Äúfashionable‚Äù cover turned out to be exactly one.  After receiving Lexand Callisto, for several days I could not understand why sometimes the screen randomly turns on at the smartphone.  It turned out that the next moment was overlooked in Lexand.  See the convex key a la iPhone under the screen?  In addition to the execution of the home task, when the screen is off, it activates it.  As you understand, under pressure with a hard face of a case in a pocket or bag, the probability of a ‚Äúfalse response‚Äù is very high.  I sincerely hope that Lexand will fix this ‚Äútrawl‚Äù soon. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/71d/c38/c20/71dc38c20b771a1f03cc71dc21bd7f23.jpg"><br><br>  And so - it‚Äôs quite great that after the purchase you don‚Äôt have to shell out extra: such accessories cost several hundred rubles.  But sometimes you get on the sales assistant, who first of all, with hope, tries to ‚Äúsqueeze‚Äù the smartphone into the ‚Äúbumper‚Äù at the cost of almost a quarter of the phone itself. <br><br>  <b>Appearance</b> <br><br>  As far as I know, now smartphone makers are interested in the commercial use of a very interesting technology.  Its essence lies in using millimeter polymer plates to form a battery of any shape.  Accordingly, in the near future, we [probably] are waiting for bold experiments and innovative solutions in terms of ergonomics.  In the meantime, I think with infinite longing - what other new words can be used to characterize another rectangular smartphone with the same set of keys and connectors. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/659/214/ae7/659214ae78ec14df2ede4868805d1232.jpg"><br><br>  Although I will not exaggerate too much.  For example, the same round button brings at least some variety to the ‚Äúclassic appearance of an Android smartphone. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7ba/411/41b/7ba41141b4aa98d0170792cc6bfe06fd.jpg"><br><br>  Until recently, B-brands loved to ‚Äúdecorate‚Äù smartphones with shiny inserts.  Here, Lexand was not stingy and gave a large shiny rim around the perimeter of the model.  Overall, the Lexand Callisto looks like a regular workhorse.  To boast of this will not work, but the elusive spirit of the mediocre design dvuhsimochnikov last year, she was deprived. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1d8/5c4/6dc/1d85c46dc511b97e67c0c2ad63861cd4.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e9c/6ba/413/e9c6ba4136270400e7d9decc835835f2.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4c8/aa1/db6/4c8aa1db655dae650e0b0514b5ffdd79.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/bcb/2ac/c55/bcb2acc557f1af176f0bb070dfc549b1.jpg"><br><br>  The high build quality is no surprise now.  Here and Lexand Callisto once again reminds that even in relatively inexpensive smartphones the absence of cod in the case is more a rule rather than an exception.  The material of the back cover is a familiar soft-plastic, I think everyone is familiar.  In ergonomics, I liked that the power and volume buttons are located under the fingers.  Even in the flagships, it is far from always, which sometimes seriously affects usability.  Plus, the keys in Lexand Callisto protrude above the body in such a way as not to catch the eye, but to have a normal course and easily be seen by touch.  And then in another flagship (hello, HTC One) you hardly find where the top is, and where is the bottom and the volume rocker. <br><br>  <b>Screen</b> <br><br>  Here we are waiting for direct greetings from the world of navigators.  Because only there manufacturers call WVGA only HD-resolution :) Here and Lexand in the characteristics of the display indicates: "5.0 inch HD (800 x 480)".  In fact, this is a typical 5-inch TFT touch screen with good sensitivity, but noticeable brand.  Fortunately, the display returns to the pristine purity of literally one holding the whole "body" of the finger on the surface.  The stock of brightness is normal, but in the sun it is better not to work with games or programs with faded tones.  Viewing angles are small, inversion appears only when the top of the screen approaches the user. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/70c/9c1/f45/70c9c1f458814a4f13adeed7f5086d9c.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Camera</b> <br><br>  Frontal 1.3 MP honestly work out the task of ‚Äúidentify the owner in the video chat‚Äù, and more is not required of such a camera.  The rear 8 megapixel records for speed of shooting do not beat and prefer static objects.  To obtain a good picture should provide adequate lighting.  I think the "glamorous chikam" in the dimly lit latrines of fashionable clubs will not like to be photographed in front of a mirror with Lexand Callisto.  Nevertheless, he handles the function of the entry-level soap box.  I am glad that the standard shooting interface was not cut, there are HDR, panoramas, and detailed settings such as brightness, contrast and sharpness. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/dee/2c4/aff/dee2c4aff01bab4ab7e03c0e987e0522.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/711/aa1/04d/711aa104db74058042a71d85d2761c2a.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6a6/032/27e/6a603227ed4e7ce9f7cfe1bd00992f24.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Performance</b> <br><br>  In fact, what can be said about the MediaTek MT6577 bundle (1 GHz), 512 MB of RAM and PowerVR SGX531 graphics?  The smartphone does not work too fast, multitasking is better left to ‚Äúgigabyte‚Äù models - here also affects the limited amount of RAM.  On the other hand, even if a browser or another application is running, no ‚Äúcrashes‚Äù or unreasonable delays will be disturbed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9d3/e62/fe0/9d3e62fe08139fe76322891bfefe5ea9.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/dcd/283/bc5/dcd283bc51ed13e91a0354d18c723eaf.png"><br><br>  In the game question, the chipset of stars from the sky is not enough, but it also does not create outright "infringements" of gamers.  For example, in Real Racing 3 the sound brakes wildly, but at the same time the picture remains more than playable.  In other blockbusters such as Frontline Commando, everything is also predictable: in some places you have to endure the ‚Äúplatform costs‚Äù, but there are no critical long-term FPS drops. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4d6/410/d99/4d6410d9981d2e0f9b1017e62593607d.png"><br><br>  <b>System</b> <br><br>  By default, Lexand Callisto has Android 4.0.4 installed.  As you know, the appearance of updated versions of the system does not depend on the brand, but on the chip maker.  In this case, it is known for certain that MediaTek developed for MT6577 an update to Android 4.1 (more precisely, to 4.1.2).  Will there be an official ‚Äúupdate‚Äù for Lexand Callisto - a big question considering the brand‚Äôs debut in the field of smartphones. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d56/da0/7f9/d56da07f953a0c8edcde91f41434cc00.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/06a/1f1/aa8/06a1f1aa83a4b1a59c619e9c225de3c1.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/471/5a5/f8d/4715a5f8dedadf8ccfaeacbe16a20ac7.png"><br><br>  The appearance of the operating system in Lexand did not touch, focusing on the software content.  Here you will find both Dr.Web Light anti-virus, Odnoklassniki, a flashlight, and (much the same without it) Navitel Navigator.  I would really like to see a paid license, but no - the navigation is provided in a 60-day trial version.  In general, there is nothing to scold Lexand Callisto on software.  In the end, the brand again took care of the "average" buyer, trying to provide a smartphone with a wide functionality out of the box. <br><br>  <b>Battery</b> <br><br>  2,000 mAh was enough so that, depending on the load, the Lexand Callisto was discharged after about a day and a half.  The Antutu Battery Test revealed 557 points, which is a good result.  The main thing - with Lexand Callisto, you can be sure that until the end of the working day to look for the outlet is definitely not necessary. <br><br>  <b>Conclusion</b> <br><br>  Lexand Callisto is nothing more than a reasonable solution for those who do not want to get the perfect design for Ponte and beautiful technical characteristics.  The model provides support for a pair of SIM-cards, web surfing, games, navigation, and other attributes of the smartphone on the big screen (with a small resolution).  In my opinion, in a good way, Lexand should have been included in the kit also with a car holder.  To this inclines the core activities of the brand and features of the device.  It is worth Lexand Callisto, I repeat, 7 990 rubles. <br><br>  There are no global flaws in the device.  If the brand removes the option of turning on the screen from a round button - it will be just great.  As a result, I can recommend a model for consideration if, for whatever reason, you are among consumers <a href="">with such requirements for a smartphone</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/184908/">https://habr.com/ru/post/184908/</a></p>
