  <section class="page js-page"><h1>At the start, attention, N900!</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello, dear habrasoobschestvo.  Today, continuing my series of articles on the Nokia N900, I will conduct a rather non-standard comparison of three devices (almost a comparison of a <a href="">vacuum cleaner and a refrigerator</a> ). <br>  In the summer, many run and ride bikes.  Some use specialized computers for this.  And if this is not or do not want to buy?  In this case, you can use the N900! <br>  Since I have been running for a long time, I have two running computers from Garmin.  In this article I decided to describe how the N900 can be turned into a running computer and how good it looks against the background of professional specialized tools. <br><img src="http://erudenko.com/photo/N900/th9/thesis1.jpg"><br>  Under the cut, I will conduct a comparative analysis and find out how much the Nokia N900 can replace specialized computers from Garmin.  And in this analysis I will be helped by two of my other devices: the Garmin FR50 and the Garmin FR305. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Introduction </h3><br><br>  It's no secret that summer has come!  And summer is a great time to enjoy outdoor sports.  After all, this sport is much more interesting and useful.  One such sport is jogging and cycling.  And it does not matter whether you run long distances or short (beer doesn‚Äôt count as a beer in a tent :-)), you ride a bike through the park or drive a track, the main thing is pleasure and health. <br>  But for a technical person it is always important to know the parameters for analysis and comparison.  Plus, if you play sports also with excitement, then in this case you just need to keep the logs of all activities.  And most importantly, with intensive exercises, it is necessary to control the work of the heart and heart zones so that the training does not turn into harm. <br>  For such monitoring there are specialized computers.  At one time, I conducted a rather deep analysis of this market and I can confidently say that Garmin is the leader with its Forerunner line. <br>  Of course, there are still big and good players on the market: <a href="http://www.polar.fi/en">Polar</a> , Suunto and even from ‚Äúall-sports‚Äù manufacturers such as <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipod/nike/">Nike (along with Apple)</a> and <a href="http://www.newbalance-running.com/acatalog/New-Balance-Watches-and-Heart-Rate-Monitors.html">New Balance</a> and many others. <br><br>  But Garmin appeared on the market one of the first and have a very wide range of devices.  Good marketing and continuous product development in combination with a wide price range (from 2500 rubles) make Garmin very popular around the world among amateurs and <a href="http://www8.garmin.com/sportssponsorships/index.html">professionals</a> .

    <h3>  What for ? </h3><br>  Why are all these computers needed?  I'll try to explain.  In general, there are several basic reasons for using a running or cycling sports computer. <br><ol><li>  Just wondering. </li><li>  Health. </li><li>  Progress. </li></ol><br><br><img src="http://erudenko.com/photo/N900/th9/funnyman.jpg"><br>  First option.  When just wondering.  So much more fun to run.  You know how many ran, at what speed, which route is now and which is the last time.  You can compare.  It all gives excitement and "sports interest." <br>  The second option on the one hand is simple and straightforward.  But not everything is so simple.  Running and other sports exercises can not improve health, but it's great to make it worse.  And this can be done almost instantly.  Of course, if you are 18 years old, you shouldn‚Äôt especially control the heart rhythm while running, but if you are over 30, and even more than 40 years old, and you decide to start playing sports - a heart rate monitor is simply vital in the literal sense of the word. <br><br>  For those who do it all professionally or for the result (for themselves or for compliance with standards), it is very important to know the progress, weaknesses, bad days and running parameters.  Moreover, it is important to know them both during the run (to speed up at the right moment or simply not to lose the rhythm) and after the run (to collect and analyze statistics to adjust and improve the training strategy).  A professional athlete simply cannot do without these tools today. <br><br><h3>  What is the difference ? </h3><br>  This is not a review of Harmin gadgets, but I will describe the main parameters of such devices in order to determine which niche in this lineup the N900 occupies (or claims to occupy). <br>  Computers can be divided into two types: without GPS and with GPS.  The first is usually cheaper and less.  They require additional devices to measure distance (pedometer or connects to a treadmill).  The second is bigger and more expensive.  They are able to determine the position and speed using the GPS module.  But usually they have the ability to connect a pedometer or a treadmill for training in the gym. <br>  The second criterion is "tricked".  There are devices with a full range of functionality.  They are used by professionals and they are usually located on the ‚Äútop of the product line‚Äù.  The second is simpler and they are used by people who have no reason to go wild in the jungle of professional training, but you need to control the process in general terms. <br>  The third parameter is specialization.  I‚Äôm talking about running computers here, but they can also be used when riding a bicycle.  Moreover, it is possible to use them in the multisport mode (in the USSR it was called ‚Äúall-around‚Äù).  When in the framework of one workout you use several sports.  For example - you run 5 km, then run an acceleration of 400m, then ride a 10km bike, then a canoe and then a walking race.  Some computers can allow you to control up to 16 !!!  different kinds of sports in the framework of one workout (I do not have enough knowledge and imagination to come up with so much).  And there are just running or cycling. <br>  And the fourth parameter is generation.  As we all know, time is ticking, but in the world of electronic devices it just flies (I really want this trend to persist for another 100 years :-)). <br>  And many may ask the question - why keep them a few? <br><img src="http://erudenko.com/photo/N900/th9/garmins.jpg"><br>  Again, there is no definite answer!  Some professionals lack the functionality of one particular device, so they combine out of two or three.  Some control the accuracy with an optional device.  But I, for example, keep three computers for quite simple reasons: the first computer I also have is a clock, the second phone, and the third is just a running computer.  And together they are a great team :-) <br>  Certainly, the N900 claims to be at the top of these characteristics, since it: has GPS, no marketing restrictions (write software, with any number of ‚Äúbells and whistles‚Äù), hardware and software are much more functional (because the device is more extensive). <br>  Ie, the potential is great, let's see how the N900 fits into the current implementation. <br><br><h3>  Characteristics of devices. </h3><br>  So I have three devices: Garmin FR50, FR305 and N900.  A little about them. <br><br><h4>  Garmin FR50 </h4><br>  <a href="http://www8.garmin.com/buzz/fr50/">Here is a very colorful presentation.</a> <br>  It looks very similar to ordinary watches.  The size of a little "thicker" of their fellow-hours, but the feelings do not cause any discomfort, if worn as a simple watch.  The kit usually includes a heart rate monitor (HRM), a pedometer (Foot Pod) and an ANT module for the computer. <br><img alt="http://erudenko.com/photo/N900/th9/FR50.jpg" src="http://erudenko.com/photo/N900/th9/FR50.jpg"><br>  All external sensors at Garmin work under the ANT / ANT + protocol.  This is something like a bluetooth, only slightly in other frequencies.  The industrial standard and I have met it so far only in the implementation of Garmin.  Undoubtedly, this is a big plus, since there will be no interference from other devices, and information from the sensors must come in real time. <br>  Moreover, in order not to clutter up this small computer with a USB port or Bluetooth module, it was quite logical to use the built-in ANT + transceiver to communicate with the computer.  That's why I needed another USB transceiver for the computer. <br><img alt="http://erudenko.com/photo/N900/th9/ant2.jpg" src="http://erudenko.com/photo/N900/th9/ant2.jpg"><br>  The heart rate monitor is one of the sensors that works according to the ANT + protocol. <br><img alt="http://erudenko.com/photo/N900/th9/HRM.jpg" src="http://erudenko.com/photo/N900/th9/HRM.jpg"><br>  From the title it is clear that he transmits information about heartbeats. <br>  Pedometer - Foot Pod (also works on ANT + protocol): <br><img alt="http://erudenko.com/photo/N900/th9/foodpod.jpg" src="http://erudenko.com/photo/N900/th9/foodpod.jpg"><br>  The great advantage of the ANT protocol is that sensors can operate in a point-to-multipoint mode, ie, transmit the signal to several devices simultaneously.  It turns out that you can connect several computers to one sensor at the same time (you don‚Äôt need to hook two heartbeat monitors if there are two computers), but you can‚Äôt connect several identical sensors to one computer (restriction of program logic).  As a result, two pedometers cannot be connected to the same computer at the same time (he just does not know what to do with them :-)). <br><br>  A newer model, the Forerunner 60, has long been present on the market, which is slightly better than mine in terms of characteristics: more different colors and several design solutions, a virtual partner mode has been added, calorie counting has been added (one of the main parameters for customers in this category), the ability to directly connect to simulators (treadmill, weights, etc.), the main functions have been improved and improved. <br><br>  Key features for the FR50: <br><table><tbody><tr><td>  Weight: </td><td>  42 </td></tr><tr><td>  Battery life: </td><td>  about a year </td></tr><tr><td>  GPS </td><td>  not </td></tr><tr><td>  Memory Size: </td><td>  100 laps or 7 hours of data </td></tr><tr><td>  Pulsometer: </td><td>  chest </td></tr><tr><td>  Pedometer: </td><td>  Foot pod </td></tr><tr><td>  Computer connection: </td><td>  ANT + </td></tr><tr><td>  Automatic start of a new circle: </td><td>  there is </td></tr><tr><td>  Multisport: </td><td>  No, but you can manually emulate </td></tr><tr><td>  Complicated workouts (pre-installed and customizable): </td><td>  not </td></tr><tr><td>  Simple workouts (one parameter each) </td><td>  not </td></tr><tr><td>  Interval training: </td><td>  Yes </td></tr><tr><td>  Customizable screen (customize what to display): </td><td>  Yes </td></tr><tr><td>  Signal, when exceeding the maximum load (rhythm, heartbeat, speed): </td><td>  Yes </td></tr><tr><td>  Water Resistant: </td><td>  30 meters (I checked on 35: - <br>  )) </td></tr><tr><td>  Additional functions: </td><td>  clock </td></tr><tr><td>  Ability to history on the device: </td><td>  yes (but not very comfortable) </td></tr></tbody></table><br><br>  But 90% of the FR50 / FR60 are identical.  These are computers / watches, without GPS and a bunch of attachments.  They are an excellent choice for beginners and amateurs with a huge number of functions. <br><br><h4>  Garmin FR305 </h4><br><img src="http://erudenko.com/photo/N900/th9/305.jpg"><br>  Very powerful running computer.  In the market for a long time and earned great respect among all categories of athletes.  Although new devices appeared on the market, such as the 405CX (something between the FR50 and FR305) and the receiver - 310TX. <br>  FR310TX easier, longer battery life and a bit more buggy (from the reviews). <br><img src="http://erudenko.com/photo/N900/th9/FR310.jpg"><br>  If you do not know exactly which one to choose: 305 or 310, then I would recommend to take exactly 305. You <a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/NEW-GARMIN-FORERUNNER-305-GPS-W-HEART-RATE-MONITOR-NEW-/230486770555%3Fcmd%3DViewItem%26pt%3DGPS_Devices%26hash%3Ditem35aa15037b">can buy it on e-bay for $ 150</a> with delivery.  And in terms of functionality, it is not far behind the new device. <br>  Well, here's an example of how everything there looks on the screen: <br><img src="http://erudenko.com/photo/N900/th9/FR305_2.jpg"><img src="http://erudenko.com/photo/N900/th9/FR305_1.jpg"><br><img src="http://erudenko.com/photo/N900/th9/FR305_3.jpg"><br><br>  Very convenient and very functional device.  Of the benefits - easy to customize for yourself, many additional features. <br>  It connects to the computer via USB using the following docking station: <br><img src="http://erudenko.com/photo/N900/th9/305dock.jpg"><br><br>  Now briefly the characteristics of this miracle: <br><table><tbody><tr><td>  Weight: </td><td>  77 </td></tr><tr><td>  Battery life: </td><td>  10 hours </td></tr><tr><td>  GPS </td><td>  highly sensitive </td></tr><tr><td>  Memory Size: </td><td>  1000 laps or 50 routes </td></tr><tr><td>  Pulsometer: </td><td>  chest </td></tr><tr><td>  Pedometer: </td><td>  Foot Pod (can work instead of indoor GPS for indoor training) </td></tr><tr><td>  Computer connection: </td><td>  USB </td></tr><tr><td>  Automatic start of a new circle: </td><td>  there is </td></tr><tr><td>  Multisport: </td><td>  there is </td></tr><tr><td>  Complicated workouts (pre-installed and customizable): </td><td>  there is (a wide range of settings) </td></tr><tr><td>  Simple workouts (one parameter each) </td><td>  yes, very easy to use </td></tr><tr><td>  Interval training: </td><td>  Yes </td></tr><tr><td>  Customizable screen (customize what to display): </td><td>  yes, with the possibility of automatic switching by interval </td></tr><tr><td>  Signal, when exceeding the maximum load (rhythm, heartbeat, speed): </td><td>  Yes </td></tr><tr><td>  Water Resistant: </td><td>  (IPX7) is water-repellent, you do not need to moisten into water, but you can run in the rain </td></tr><tr><td>  Graphic screen: </td><td>  160 x 100 </td></tr><tr><td>  Autopause: </td><td>  there is </td></tr><tr><td>  Virtual partner: </td><td>  there is (on top of the picture where two little men run) </td></tr><tr><td>  Virtual trainer: </td><td>  load adjustment during <br>  training depending on the heartbeat </td></tr><tr><td>  Comparison with yesterday: </td><td>  an interesting feature of competing with yourself, based on previous results </td></tr><tr><td>  Ability to history on the device: </td><td>  yes, comfortable enough </td></tr></tbody></table><br><br>  And plus many more and many different functions.  Very powerful tool, surprisingly convenient and easy to set up. <br><br><h4>  Nokia N900 </h4><br><img src="http://erudenko.com/photo/N900/th9/N900.jpg"><br>  I think if I had not described at first the capabilities of the monsters from Garmin, then it would not be so interesting to describe how strong the N900 is as a sports computer.  After all, even the youngest and simple Garmin FR50 worth $ 50 has such a set of functionality that the imagination is not able to come up with something new (but Garmin engineers have more imagination than I do).  After all, they used to train with a stopwatch.  And now everyone can afford a running megacomputer. <br><br>  So how did the N900 become a sports computer?  But mainly due to four people: Jukka Alasalmi, Sampo Savola, Kai Skiftesvik, Veli-Pekka Haajanen.  Moreover, they do it for free.  So, we meet <a href="http://ecoach.garage.maemo.org/">eCoach</a> . <br><img src="http://erudenko.com/photo/N900/th9/N9002.jpg"><br><br>  First you need to level the odds.  Running computer is almost useless without a heart rate sensor.  Since the Harmin sensors work under the ANT + protocol, it is impossible to connect it to the N900 without additional equipment (I did not even find such additional equipment).  But there are solutions based on <a href="http://www.zephyr-technology.com/9600.0112.html">bluetooth</a> .  So you need to purchase an additional device, the price of $ 100-120. <br>  The kit is ready (I took HRM on time for tests). <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/dcd/878/9fe/dcd8789fe11f361f0bf038738c1e2ea2.png"><br>  During the one and a half month tests, I evaluated the capabilities of the N900 and compared it with the giants from Garmin.  Unfortunately, neither the photo nor the video did not work.  It turned out to be impossible to run and take a SLR at the same time :-) <br>  Here you have a "third-party" video.  I think I would not take anything new. <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/DcN0vvaXgPQ&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhiuIoJ2-mhLl2WBwjLGNFYntEmWuw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  During the training, I really liked the N900.  Everything is done quite comfortably and works very stable.  It is noticeable that the creators themselves run, and they know what you need in the first place.  The big question was how to carry it with you.  You don‚Äôt wear it on your hand, and in my hand I don‚Äôt like carrying something with me while running.  Decisions can be a mountain, but I wanted to be able to periodically glancing at the screen.  Having rummaged in house rubbish, I found such a case: <br><img src="http://erudenko.com/photo/N900/th9/belkin.jpg"><br>  It is generally for an iPhone or iPod touch, but it is quite elastic and having stretched it for a bit, I put the N900 in it.  True, the case is no longer suitable for an iPhone, but it doesn‚Äôt upset me much, since I haven‚Äôt used an iPhone for a long time (since the time of purchase, the N900 is sadly on the shelf). <br>  I placed it on the wrist.  It turned out very comfortable.  The only inconvenience is minor difficulties with pressing the screen through the film.  But since the film was tightly stretched, then this complexity can be called conditional. <br>  All eCoach training parameters showed honestly and clearly, he had no chance to lie - he was under the control of two specialized computers :-) <br>  The kit looked like this (with HRM): <br><img src="http://erudenko.com/photo/N900/th9/e_HRM.jpg"><br>  The main screen of the program looks like this: <br><img src="http://erudenko.com/photo/N900/th9/e_main.jpeg"><br>  First you need to go to the settings and customize everything for yourself: <br><img src="http://erudenko.com/photo/N900/th9/e_settings.jpg"><br>  After that, I also recommend that you select the source of the cards immediately, the one you like (schematic map, satellite image from different suppliers), since when the source changes, a program needs to be restarted: <br><img src="http://erudenko.com/photo/N900/th9/e_maps.png"><br>  After that, you can start training, choose a sport (running, bike, ski ..., and you can add your own) and go: <br><img src="http://erudenko.com/photo/N900/th9/e_map.png"><br>  I like very much what can be seen right on the map where and when I run.  One button can switch to the type of indicators, but there is a lack of a form where this information would be combined together, like I saw something similar on the N8xx. <br><img src="http://erudenko.com/photo/N900/th9/e_data.jpg"><br><br>  Everything is very clear and simple.  According to the results of the run, the discrepancies in the readings of the devices were insignificant (1-3%).  At the end of the workout, you can view the workout log and save the route: <br><img src="http://erudenko.com/photo/N900/th9/e_log.png"><br>  Also available is a log of key indicators in graphical mode: <br><img src="http://erudenko.com/photo/N900/th9/e_log2.png"><br><br>  Here is a small vidyushka showing the results of training (the old version for N8xx, but the new one is almost the same): <br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/5NMbZ5A14QE%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhiN7Qet4jZIFPYcxiz3V0z78z-t6Q" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Here is another load in the load.  This is a promo from the creators (I like it because of the deer :-)): <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/SnRONVy6vys%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhhIF-b9FwlNf3mFn6aHIUfrE2pdBA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h3>  Evaluation </h3><br>  Well, now the crucial moment is the summing up of the final assessment.  It was quite difficult to evaluate, as the devices are completely different categories.  Therefore, it is easier and more accurate to make a comparative table. <br><br><table><tbody><tr><th>  function </th><th>  FR50 </th><th>  FR305 </th><th>  N900 </th><th>  comments </th></tr><tr><td>  Weight and dimensions </td><td>  the smallest </td><td>  big enough but hung on the arm </td><td>  the largest </td><td>  additional funds are needed for the N900 to use online </td></tr><tr><td>  Battery life </td><td>  about a year </td><td>  until 10 o'clock </td><td>  a little more than a day (with GPS and Bluetooth enabled) </td><td>  of course loses the FR50, but very comfortable </td></tr><tr><td>  memory size </td><td>  a bit, you need to sync once a week with a computer </td><td>  enough for a month of offline storage </td><td>  practically unlimited </td><td>  here, undoubtedly, the N900 wins, but it is worth considering that Garmin has specialized software for processing and analyzing workouts, and in fact eCoach stores everything on the device </td></tr><tr><td>  Heart rate monitor </td><td>  garmin ANT + </td><td>  garmin ANT + </td><td>  bluetooth FRWD B600 or Zephyr HxM </td><td>  bluetooth solutions are more expensive and do not support working with multiple computers </td></tr><tr><td>  Pedometer </td><td>  Foot pod </td><td>  Foot Pod (buy separately) </td><td>  not </td><td>  unlike the Garmin solutions, the distance on the N900 can only be measured outside (in the GPS room does not work) </td></tr><tr><td>  Computer connection </td><td>  ANT + </td><td>  USB </td><td>  large selection (USB, bluetooth, WiFi) </td><td>  here of course on the N900 all for your convenience </td></tr><tr><td>  Automatic start of a new circle </td><td>  Yes </td><td>  Yes </td><td>  not </td><td>  N900 does not support the control of running in a circle </td></tr><tr><td>  Multisport </td><td>  not </td><td>  Yes </td><td>  partially </td><td>  On Nokia, you cannot simultaneously switch between different sports within one workout, but eCoach supports multisport as separate workouts, so you can use it, but switch manually </td></tr><tr><td>  Complicated workouts (pre-installed and customizable): </td><td>  not </td><td>  there is </td><td>  not </td><td>  not yet implemented, but possible </td></tr><tr><td>  Simple workouts (one parameter each) </td><td>  not </td><td>  there is </td><td>  in passive mode </td><td>  you can only monitor parameters, no alarms or changes </td></tr><tr><td>  Interval training </td><td>  Yes </td><td>  Yes </td><td>  not </td><td>  the same as with circuit training </td></tr><tr><td>  Customizable screen (customize what to display): </td><td>  Yes </td><td>  yes, with auto change views </td><td>  not </td><td>  N900 doesn‚Äôt need it much, because it is much larger than the screen </td></tr><tr><td>  Signal, when exceeding the maximum load (rhythm, heartbeat, speed): </td><td>  Yes </td><td>  Yes </td><td>  not </td><td>  not implemented, but nothing prevents to finish </td></tr><tr><td>  Water resistant </td><td>  waterproof 30 m </td><td>  you can run in the rain </td><td>  keep away from water </td><td>  need to take care of protecting the N900 from moisture </td></tr><tr><td>  Additional functions: </td><td>  clock </td><td>  not </td><td>  full computer + communicator </td><td>  N900 is multi-functional </td></tr><tr><td>  Ability to view training history on the device: </td><td>  possible but not convenient </td><td>  Yes </td><td>  Yes, with graphs, visually and very conveniently </td><td>  The N900 provides a very user-friendly interface, much better than Garmin devices, thanks to its large screen and touch interface. </td></tr><tr><td>  Interactive Map </td><td>  not </td><td>  Only the track with checkpoints, no card </td><td>  Yes, plus the choice of supplier of cards and type of cards </td><td>  eCoach allows you to select not only the source of the cards, but also the type of the cards themselves </td></tr><tr><td>  Data analysis </td><td>  <a href="http://connect.garmin.com/features">Garmin Connect</a> and <a href="http://www.garmin.com/garmin/cms/us/intosports/training_center">Garmin Training Center</a> </td><td>  <a href="http://connect.garmin.com/features">Garmin Connect</a> and <a href="http://www.garmin.com/garmin/cms/us/intosports/training_center">Garmin Training Center</a> </td><td>  only on device </td><td>  Garmin has a very large set of solutions for storing and analyzing workouts on a computer and on the network, sharing between a desktop and network solution and sharing results online, in eCoach, you can analyze information only on the device </td></tr><tr><td>  Data export </td><td>  not </td><td>  not </td><td>  Yes, as tracks and travel data </td><td>  In general, the ideal solution would be to make the converter from eCoach to Harmin tools.  It would have been a crazy symbiosis. </td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><h3>  findings </h3><br>  As you can see, the weak side of eCoach is the lack of training modes.  These modes are like a personal trainer, when you can set different parameters for running at different stages of your workout. <br>  I will give an example: running with acceleration and control by two indicators - the distance and heart rate zone. It is necessary to run with a maximum acceleration of 400 meters, then a light resting run of 400 m, and so 3-5 kilometers.  Moreover, when accelerating, the heart rhythm should be in the fifth zone (very intense, but not yet dangerous to health), and in the lung mode in the third (so as not to slip and let the heart rest).  This simple training option effectively improves overall endurance.  There are more sophisticated and sophisticated training regimes that match your goal, physical condition and experience. <br>  N900 + eCoach copes with the tasks of monitoring the parameters of the run, and can be recommended as a wonderful training computer without the functions of a personal trainer.  And in order to bring the N900 closer to a device with the functions of a trainer, you need to refine the software part.  If at the same time you make an export to the Garmin format and discard the information in <a href="http://connect.garmin.com/features">Garmin Connect</a> and the <a href="http://www.garmin.com/garmin/cms/us/intosports/training_center">Garmin Training Center</a> , then there probably won't be any sense to buy a running computer. <br>  At the same time, if you play sports for general physical development, the N900 is an excellent solution.  If you want to run more seriously (constantly improving the results and optimizing the training regime), then the N900 paired with HRM is also enough, but specialized devices will provide you with automated workout control tools. <br><br>  So, despite the fact that some functions are missing, the N900 can be safely called today a full-fledged running computer with great potential! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/97181/">https://habr.com/ru/post/97181/</a></p>
