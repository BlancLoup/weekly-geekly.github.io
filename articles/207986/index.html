In fact, 12, but in general, better c 14 ... <br>  Yes, you can before.  But do not.  Programming is mainly engaged in the analysis, processing and structuring of information.  As effective, conscious mechanisms of perception and interaction with the world - these qualities are formed (matured) in a person by 12-14 years.  Then, the study of programming becomes a natural and logical continuation of further development.  Not for everyone, but for those who see it as interesting. <br><br>  How to evaluate it?  No <br>  In 12-14 years a person has enough experience for this.  He will do it on his own (you just have to offer).  Programming is a voluminous and not the most simple area of ‚Äã‚Äãknowledge.  Without a real (independent) interest in him, programming quickly becomes hard labor.  One more, in addition to all those optional disciplines that were rather imposed in advance than offered on time.

As a rule, they themselves are not somewhat independent, manifested by specialists (professionals) and operate with their subject as a form of pure school discipline.  As if he has no real continuation beyond the school threshold.  From that - they do not know what they are doing.  They build skills grafting methods for the sake of skills.  Formal, highly distorted or practically fake skills. <br><br>  Problems of adequate (reasonably conservative) teaching, in general, are wider than the territories of individual countries and individual subject areas.  On this topic, right here: <a href="http://nbspace.ru/math/">nbspace.ru/math</a> is a translation of an interesting article ‚ÄúCrying Mathematics‚Äù (by Paul Lockhard). <br><br>  The best way to create the wrong impression is to go swimming on land and programming on paper. <br><br>  Attitude towards programming as a science is in many ways illusory.  In fact, how it originated, developed and what has become by now, programming - has all the features of technology. <br>  Programming is not the science of logic, but the technology of its application.  A comprehensive tool that allows rationality to imprint into automatic actions wherever possible.  And there is something to learn. <br><br>  The man tolerantly owns the logic by the age of 5-7. <br>  The adequacy of the same - continues to comprehend throughout life.  Almost all developed technologies and programming, too, explicitly operate with adequacy.  Develop it.  Without this, many difficult, interesting and very useful tasks would risk and remain only projects. <br><br>  A passion for programming does not necessarily make him a profession in the future. <br>  Yes, it is extremely fascinating, sharpens logic, manufacturability of thinking.  But like so much else - it just develops.  To a greater or lesser degree, depending on ability, interest, and timeliness.  Its importance should not be exaggerated, nor underestimated.  Someone, for example: tennis, hockey, music, acrobatics or drawing ... - will more naturally form actual (interesting and effective) skills at suitable (again) points in time.  Skills that are used in programming too.  And - as something quite basic. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fc5/67e/0ea/fc567e0eabf634244c598da84b64c531.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  In various, pronounced skills, almost nothing is strictly local. <br>  Real (effective) skills mutually penetrate and support each other.  Form a harmonious, independent personality, develop character.  And unbalanced, obviously narrow specialization spoils both thinking and plasticity of a person. <br><br>  How is programming up to 12 years old comprehended? <br>  As an integral part of life.  Like games and structural activities. <br><br>  And yes. <br>  A child who has a pronounced interest in programming before the age of 12 simply takes and deals with them.  According to your choice.  Individual features of development form individual directions of interest regardless of the time of its manifestation. <br><br>  Among other things. <br>  The opinion has accumulated that, up to 12 years, the passion for robotics for children is much more efficient, visual, and more interesting than programming.  At this age, it is programming, more than itself.  And what is very good: it does not create a problematic stratum from sussy-start terminology, which is typical of too early methods of teaching children to programming. <br><br>  There is a suspicion that the future does not like being rushed (and even at the expense of children) ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a35/ec3/afc/a35ec3afcaf943aefe744bdcb0154f0a.jpg" alt="image"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/207986/">https://habr.com/ru/post/207986/</a></p>
