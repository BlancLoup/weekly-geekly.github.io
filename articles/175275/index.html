Model range "Spring - Summer 2013"</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/681/dbe/42b/681dbe42b46a1ae7204d983bd30cd34c.jpg"><br>  It's hard to imagine a more cognate Intel concept than a ‚Äúprocessor‚Äù.  At one time, having a hand in the appearance of this class of devices in the mass market, now Intel is spending no less effort on their continuous improvement.  As a result of these titanic efforts, a regular change of generations of processors: everybody knows about tick-tack.  Let's, however, fix the picture and take a look at the whole processor lineup - on what basis is it built?  Let's start with the server processors Intel Xeon. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The Intel Xeon line originates from the time of the Pentium II.  Historically, they were built on the same microarchitectures as desktop processors with the addition of specific server features, such as support for multiprocessing, increased cache, support for an extended set of instructions, etc.  If we talk about the current Xeon'ah from the point of view of the platform, it turns out quite an interesting picture. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4c7/23f/387/4c723f38775874e742c5c078f5c016fb.jpg"><br><br>  However, if you think about it, the situation when the three Xeon families are so scattered across the Intel technology line does not seem strange.  Server processors are much more difficult than desktop ones, it takes a long time to develop and implement those very specific features, and the more of them the longer.  That's why the simplest E3 "jumped" the farthest;  with them we will begin the analysis of Xeon by families.

    <h4>  Intel Xeon E3 </h4>  The current line of Intel Xeon E3 is represented by E3-12xx v.2 models (note v.2, v.1 were built on Sandy Bridge).  Their main purpose is budget single-socket servers, as well as embedded systems that are not too demanding on the computational resource.  In the line, there are models with reduced power consumption (they have an L index), the <a href="http://ark.intel.com/ru/products/65735/Intel-Xeon-Processor-E3-1220L-v2-3M-Cache-2_30-GHz">E3-1220L</a> super energy efficient model <a href="http://ark.intel.com/ru/products/65735/Intel-Xeon-Processor-E3-1220L-v2-3M-Cache-2_30-GHz">stays a bit different</a> , but we will exclude it from further review. <br>  In general, the picture looks like this.  The E3-12xxx v.2 processors have a frequency of 3.1 to 3.7 GHz, 4 cores and hyper-trading (with the exception of low-end models 122x - they are without hyper-trading).  All 8 MB cache support Turbo Boost.  There are two memory channels, the frequency is up to 1600 MHz, the maximum capacity is up to 32 GB.  The processors with the five at the end have an integrated graphics core Intel HD Graphics P4000 (for model E3-1265L - Intel HD Graphics 2500).  All processors support virtualization technology VT-x / VT-d, Trusted execution and the latest version of SpeedStep.  For greater clarity, let's draw a summary table of the main parameters for three processors from different ends of the line.  You will find a complete comparison table on the well-known site <a href="http://ark.intel.com/">ark.intel.com</a> . <br><table><tbody><tr><th></th><th>  E3-1290 v2 </th><th>  E3-1270 v2 </th><th>  E3-1220 v2 </th></tr><tr><td>  Clock frequency, GHz </td><td>  3.7 </td><td>  3.5 </td><td>  3.1 </td></tr><tr><td>  Turbo boost frequency, GHz </td><td>  4.1 </td><td>  3.9 </td><td>  3.5 </td></tr><tr><td>  Number of cores / threads </td><td>  4/8 </td><td>  4/8 </td><td>  4/4 </td></tr><tr><td>  Cache memory, MB </td><td>  eight </td><td>  eight </td><td>  eight </td></tr><tr><td>  Max.  memory capacity, GB </td><td>  32 </td><td>  32 </td><td>  32 </td></tr><tr><td>  Number of memory channels </td><td>  2 </td><td>  2 </td><td>  2 </td></tr><tr><td>  Max.  Estimated  Power, W </td><td>  87 </td><td>  69 </td><td>  69 </td></tr><tr><td>  Reference point.  cost, $ </td><td>  885 </td><td>  328 </td><td>  189 </td></tr></tbody></table>  We emphasize once again that E3 processors are not used in multiprocessor systems. <br><br><h4>  Intel Xeon E5 </h4>  The E5 line looks more colorful.  This is due to the fact that E5 is the main "workhorse" of Intel for servers, its scope of application is diverse, therefore, a greater variation of parameters is required.  E5 processors are divided into three large groups: from bottom to top - E5-24xx, E5-26xx, E5-46xx.  5-24, 5-26 - processors for two-socket servers, 5-46 - for four-socket.  In order not to get lost in numbers, we will immediately issue a pivot table, it includes two processors from each group - the top one and the smallest one. <br><table><tbody><tr><th></th><th>  E5-2403 </th><th>  E5-2470 </th><th>  E5-2603 </th><th>  E5-2690 </th><th>  E5-4603 </th><th>  E5-4650 </th></tr><tr><td>  Clock frequency, GHz </td><td>  1.8 </td><td>  2.3 </td><td>  1.8 </td><td>  2.9 </td><td>  2 </td><td>  2.7 </td></tr><tr><td>  Turbo boost frequency, GHz </td><td></td><td>  3.1 </td><td></td><td>  3.8 </td><td></td><td>  3.3 </td></tr><tr><td>  Number of cores / threads </td><td>  4/4 </td><td>  8/16 </td><td>  4/4 </td><td>  8/16 </td><td>  4/8 </td><td>  8/16 </td></tr><tr><td>  Cache memory, MB </td><td>  ten </td><td>  20 </td><td>  ten </td><td>  20 </td><td>  ten </td><td>  20 </td></tr><tr><td>  Number of QPI compounds </td><td>  one </td><td>  one </td><td>  2 </td><td>  2 </td><td>  2 </td><td>  2 </td></tr><tr><td>  System bus speed </td><td>  6.4 </td><td>  eight </td><td>  6.4 </td><td>  eight </td><td>  6.4 </td><td>  eight </td></tr><tr><td>  Scalability </td><td>  2 </td><td>  2 </td><td>  2 </td><td>  2 </td><td>  four </td><td>  four </td></tr><tr><td>  Max.  memory capacity, GB </td><td>  375 </td><td>  375 </td><td>  750 </td><td>  750 </td><td>  1500 </td><td>  1500 </td></tr><tr><td>  Number of memory channels </td><td>  3 </td><td>  3 </td><td>  four </td><td>  four </td><td>  four </td><td>  four </td></tr><tr><td>  Max.  Estimated  Power, W </td><td>  80 </td><td>  95 </td><td>  80 </td><td>  135 </td><td>  95 </td><td>  130 </td></tr><tr><td>  Reference point.  cost, $ </td><td>  188 </td><td>  1440 </td><td>  198 </td><td>  2057 </td><td>  551 </td><td>  3616 </td></tr></tbody></table>  Let's set one practical, and, for certain, for someone an important question: what processor is more optimal to use in entry-level servers?  That is, how much faster is the E5 processor than E3 (the first one has more cores, the second one has higher frequency)?  And what will be the performance gain when adding a second E5?  Intel has already done everything.  For all tests, the result is approximately the same: a one-and-a-half increase when E3 is replaced by E5 and a double increase - when the number of processors is doubled.  By the way, switching to 4 sockets will give the same linear effect. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/71f/900/34c/71f90034c6205a355eb516402adc9cdc.jpg"><br><br>  Those who wish to get a productive system are more compact, I advise you to pay attention to the E5-26xx series, which is suitable for almost any task - it‚Äôs not for nothing that Intel calls it the mainstream.  The peculiarity of this series is two QPI lines for two processors;  thus, the two sockets of the system exchange data at speeds, twice the standard. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1e3/dfd/50a/1e3dfd50ae3cfdfff9c9177d813b2da2.jpg"><br>  <i>Red shows changes from previous generation.</i> <br><br><h4>  Intel Xeon E7 </h4>  E7 processors are also represented by three families: 7-28, 7-48, 7-88.  As you might guess, the first for two, the second for four, and the third for eight-socket systems.  We present a pivot table compiled according to a similar principle as for the E5. <br><table><tbody><tr><th></th><th>  E7-2803 </th><th>  E7-2870 </th><th>  E7-4807 </th><th>  E7-4870 </th><th>  E7-8830 </th><th>  E7-8870 </th></tr><tr><td>  Clock frequency, GHz </td><td>  1.73 </td><td>  2.4 </td><td>  1.86 </td><td>  2.4 </td><td>  2.13 </td><td>  2.4 </td></tr><tr><td>  Turbo boost frequency, GHz </td><td></td><td>  2.8 </td><td></td><td>  2.8 </td><td>  2.4 </td><td>  2.8 </td></tr><tr><td>  Number of cores / threads </td><td>  6/12 </td><td>  10/20 </td><td>  6/12 </td><td>  10/20 </td><td>  8/16 </td><td>  10/20 </td></tr><tr><td>  Cache memory, MB </td><td>  18 </td><td>  thirty </td><td>  18 </td><td>  thirty </td><td>  24 </td><td>  thirty </td></tr><tr><td>  Number of QPI compounds </td><td>  one </td><td>  one </td><td>  2 </td><td>  2 </td><td>  2 </td><td>  2 </td></tr><tr><td>  System bus speed </td><td>  4.8 </td><td>  6.4 </td><td>  4.8 </td><td>  6.4 </td><td>  6.4 </td><td>  6.4 </td></tr><tr><td>  Scalability </td><td>  2 </td><td>  2 </td><td>  four </td><td>  four </td><td>  eight </td><td>  eight </td></tr><tr><td>  Max.  memory capacity, GB </td><td>  1024 </td><td>  1024 </td><td>  2048 </td><td>  2048 </td><td>  4096 </td><td>  4096 </td></tr><tr><td>  Number of memory channels </td><td>  four </td><td>  four </td><td>  four </td><td>  four </td><td>  four </td><td>  four </td></tr><tr><td>  Max.  Estimated  Power, W </td><td>  105 </td><td>  130 </td><td>  95 </td><td>  130 </td><td>  105 </td><td>  130 </td></tr><tr><td>  Reference point.  cost, $ </td><td>  774 </td><td>  4227 </td><td>  890 </td><td>  4394 </td><td>  2280 </td><td>  4616 </td></tr></tbody></table>  It is noteworthy that the frequency of top-end processors is low compared to other classes (note that they are the same in all families), as well as the reduced speed of the system bus.  E7 is definitely taken not by number, but by skill - it makes sense to write a separate post about them (skills).  Although the number is also the number of cores.  Using E7 allows you to achieve the highest density of processors per system - 8. At the same time, as we know, the QPI bus is routable, so the processor has the ability to exchange data not only with neighboring "colleagues", but with everyone. <br>  As we have already seen, the E7 family is the oldest of the current Intel server offerings, it is now just two years old.  That is why it is possible with a high degree of confidence to assume that the E7 is the first contender for the update, and this event is likely not far off. <br><br><h4>  To change or not to change? </h4>  Another pressing question that makes experts delve into the processor specifications - does it make sense to update the platform in the light of solving problems?  In conclusion, talking about Intel Xeon I will give some figures and facts on this subject on the example of E5. <br>  What has changed in the new generation Xeon processors compared to the previous one and how much faster are they?  First of all, we note the trend towards integration on the processor chip of the controllers responsible for input-output.  Embedded I / O Solution <br>  Intel Integrated I / O reduces data latency by 30%;  Intel Data Direct I / O technology (direct I / O transfer directly to / from the processor cache, bypassing the main memory for all types of traffic) gave a more than double speed increase.  Still the same two-fold increase in speed can be obtained if you switch to PCIe 3.0.  By the way, reducing the load on the memory significantly reduces its power consumption;  In general, the new platform is 70% more energy efficient than the previous one. <br>  Thus, if you are already experiencing a lack of resources or they are slowly but surely coming to an end, the transition to a new generation will solve your problem.  Well, to talk about Intel Xeon, we will definitely return to the blog. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/175275/">https://habr.com/ru/post/175275/</a></p>
