Meet normcore marketing</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Constant attempts to sell something pretty tired of buyers.  The promotion of goods has become so complicated that simplicity and brevity have become more efficient to work.  Normcore marketing comes to the fore.  And what does this mean, we will tell in the article. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h3>  What is the essence </h3><br>  Normcore marketing began with fashion.  A couple of years ago, the K-HOLE team suggested a ‚Äúfashion without fashion‚Äù.  Things are not needed to be different from other people.  Clothing is a necessity, not a way of expression. <br><br>  Supported this movement (perhaps unconsciously) Steve Jobs.  In public, he quietly appeared in the same thing - in jeans and a dark turtleneck.

People are tired of running and decided to slow down a bit. <br><br>  Slow Food and Slow TV appeared.  The changes affected the rhythm of life in general, which is reflected in the movement Slow Moments.  Humanity developed ‚Äúslow‚Äù habits: drawing, meditation.  People want peace and quiet, and not advertising that is flickering before their eyes. <br><br><h3>  Why is the normcore effective? </h3><br><ol><li>  Shoppers tried so many times to surprise that the picture with the landscape works more efficiently.  Against the background of unusualness, ordinary things attract attention. </li><li>  Sophisticated technologies tire users.  They should just be useful. </li><li>  The concept of values ‚Äã‚Äãis changing.  Harmony with yourself is valued more real estate, and the ability to travel - more stable work. </li></ol><br>  Inevitably, the approach to advancement is changing.  Advertising becomes simple, reflects the usual aspects of life. <br><br><h3>  Normcore advertising </h3><br>  A vivid example of a movie in this style that has become known to the whole world is the video produced by DIAGEO with Nick Offermann.  The full version lasts as much as 10 hours, and all this time the actor just drinks whiskey.  And that's all. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CcLp7tBepo0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Another famous example is paint advertising.  The main character is painting the fence.  No action. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8yJLiocXGFE" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Simplicity and brevity is known advertising company Yota.  People want silence and the Internet.  And they get what they want. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pmLgkSdp-gc" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  A simple but original advertisement pleased the LEGO company. <br><br><img src="http://dl3.joxi.net/drive/2018/10/02/0031/0038/2039846/46/7ace04999a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Throughout its existence, Kit Kat reminds its customers that it is time to rest.  This is evidenced by the company's advertising. <br><br><img src="http://dl3.joxi.net/drive/2018/10/02/0031/0038/2039846/46/e18d812e1d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Promotion with an emphasis on conciseness and clarity is practiced by car manufacturers.  In the Mercedes advertising there is a clear essence, and a little humor, and a beautiful winter landscape. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_ImDUHMpjrA" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  This ad is the product of Ford marketers.  It was created when women of Saudi Arabia were allowed to drive a car. <br><br><img src="http://dl3.joxi.net/drive/2018/10/02/0031/0038/2039846/46/9515b756b7.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h3>  Who will work the normcore marketing </h3><br>  Whether the principle of normal activity in your company depends on the type of activity and target audience.  Normcore suitable for those who: <br><br><ul><li>  engaged in production.  The monotonous work of machine tools, the process of creating a shirt or baking a cake is what the audience needs today.  Record the process on a video about show customers. </li><li>  connects his work with nature.  In the bustle of city life, there should be time to contemplate cows walking on green grass. </li><li>  helps to rest others.  Watching vacation videos helps you relax. </li></ul><br>  The transition to normkor marketing opens a new field for the imagination of advertisers.  But the decision to create such an advertisement should be considered, since blind imitation does not always lead to success. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/425169/">https://habr.com/ru/post/425169/</a></p>
