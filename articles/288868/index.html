Honestly I do not know!  I do not know how others do it.  I can say one thing: to start a TV channel, when you have a bag of money, investors and all that, it seems to me now something trivial.  With money, as they say, and a fool can.  But without money - how?  I'll tell you about our path. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>First there was a dog ...</b> <br><br>  I got my first dog when I was old enough, my parents didn't allow me as a child.  "Here you grow up, you will have your own home ..." And so on ... <br>  In general, a dog appeared, then I accidentally got on television, worked in the department as an assistant director, and then my dog-friends said: ‚ÄúYou work on television, but we still don‚Äôt have a single program about dogs!  Do it! ‚ÄùI never dreamed of a TV presenter‚Äôs career, but, on reflection, I decided - and why not?  Everybody around is doing something, they are shooting, and I, what, I can not?  It was in 1994.  Regional television developed rapidly, television channels received licenses, and, therefore, needed ‚Äútheir product‚Äù, so everyone on TV went to all!  I still sincerely believe that I was just lucky then.  Now to get on TV and create the author's program is much more difficult.

      You ask, what does all this have to do with the opening of the Dog Channel TV channel?  Yes, the most direct.  First, it is now clear that I have long been ‚Äúin the canine topic‚Äù: for 12 years, the ‚ÄúJust a Dog‚Äù program went on the air weekly, first in my city, and then on regional channels in Ukraine and Russia.  And secondly - and this is very important for me - I am familiar with the process of creating a television product from the beginning to the end not by hearsay.  She worked in the frame and behind the scenes, live, mounted, organized shootings, including historical reconstructions, was a program director and executive producer of the channel.  In short, there is some experience!  It was this experience that became my ‚Äúinitial capital‚Äù.  Experience, idea, team and DESIRE ... <br><br>  <b>We all learned a little ...</b> <br><br>  We, as a rule, make certain decisions, guided by our own life experience.  I was lucky - a few years ago I, as an executive producer and program director, participated in the launch of the new satellite channel ENGLISH CLUB TV.  It was during this period that I gained invaluable experience in organizing and planning the process of producing television content, managing a team, and imposing a broadcasting grid; I learned to think not in one program, but in channel categories.  And not just a channel, but a thematic, ‚Äúniche‚Äù one. <br><br>  World trends suggest that the audience is striving ever more for a greater segmentation, people are no longer satisfied with what mass television imposes.  The viewer goes to the specialized, niche channels that meet his needs.  So they appear like mushrooms after rain.  And this is despite the fact that launching a channel, obtaining a license, producing content is worth a lot of money! <br><br>  But if I were asked to say what the most important lesson I learned from the experience of launching a new channel, I would answer: DO NOT THINK THAT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE!  You just need to take and do, if you have an idea, of course. <br><br>  At the first stage, the investment in the project was completely ridiculous - this is the registration of the domain name dog-channel.tv and the development of a site based on CMS Joomla.  All together cost $ 250.  The task was the following - to create an easy-to-manage site (such that even a blonde like me can easily add information), and at the same time on one of the local TV channels we resumed the program with the same name, which still exists for advertisers.  This allowed a week ago to update the video content on the site weekly.  All participants in the project at that time worked on their main jobs and only in their spare time took part in the promotion of Dog Channel TV.  But nevertheless, the work was done significant.  We created a newsletter, formed our own database of dog kennels in Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and the Baltic States, and, most importantly, we began to receive much-needed feedback.  Hooray!  We are watching!  We are interesting! <br><br>  The peculiarity of our project is that it has two main components - it is <b>web</b> and <b>online</b> .  If with the characteristics of the <b>web</b> everything is more or less clear - this is the number of unique visitors per day / month and monthly traffic, then with <b>online</b> broadcasting everything is not so simple.  Here it is more appropriate to talk about users who are simultaneously watching the online broadcast, and the bandwidth of Internet channels.  Our task is to find the optimal combination of these indicators, on the one hand, to ensure a comfortable quality of broadcasting, and on the other hand, to use the available capacity as efficiently as possible. <br><br>  To date, we have up to 4,000 unique visits per day and a little more than 100,000 per month.  This refers to the web component.  As for the video, the dedicated channel allows you to serve about 100 simultaneous connections.  Now we have enough of this.  Technically, we are able to increase the number of simultaneous connections 10 times without special problems.  This is the near future.  But when the figure ‚Äúexceeds‚Äù 1000, then additional investments will be needed in the development and implementation of load balancing schemes.  The task that we set for ourselves for a year is to increase the average indicators by an order of magnitude. <br><br>  At the moment we are only at the beginning of a long way - the channel as such is only six months old. <br>  While private investment is a great help, and to put it simply - thanks to the kind people who believed in us and our idea! <br><br>  In the future, we plan to receive the main income from advertising and the production of promotional products, including custom-made presentation films for large cynological kennels and pet food manufacturers. <br><br>  I confess that at first I viewed the TV channel on the Internet as an intermediate stage on my way to the satellite channel.  Well, I'm a television man!  I underestimated the possibilities of the Internet and the pace at which technologies will be developed that will allow us to do everything the same as on a satellite today, only more!  This includes several content titration channels, video on demand, and content delivery in different quality - depending on the user's Internet speed, instant feedback, targeted advertising, and much more.  So the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãtransition has become the main one, and now we feel that we are a full-fledged TV channel with great opportunities.  But with great responsibility.  As they say, noblesse oblige.  In the future - the translation of content into English and the opening of several offices, in Europe and America.  Our viewers live there too! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/288868/">https://habr.com/ru/post/288868/</a></p>
