    <h3>  Go </h3><br>  Back in 1968, <b>Gordon Moore</b> and <b>Robert Noyce</b> founded the company for the production of microcircuits - <b>Intel</b> .  A few years before, Gordon Moore had formulated the law for the development of the semiconductor industry, which still works: the number of transistors in integrated circuits doubles every two years.  Probably, he did not think and didn‚Äôt guess that soon enough, in a century or two, quantum electronics would replace the awkward semiconductor electronics.  For clarity, the first x86-compatible processor (Intel i486) was born in 1989 and consisted of more than a million transistors.  After just 20 years, the Core I7 came out, consisting of 731 million transistors.  It is obvious that productivity, as well as technical processes, grew by orders of magnitude.  And if after 100 years, miniature superproductive processors capable of interacting without interaction with the human body will only be mastered, then here‚Äôs the quantum ‚Äúbrains‚Äù will surely already be. <br><br><h3>  Points </h3><br>  In size, such processors will be no more than a typographical point, or perhaps even have a size of several nanometers.  Despite its gigantic performance, with this size their heat generation will be practically absent.  Production at the molecular-atomic level will be honed to such an extent that any errors in the architecture will simply be excluded.  Absolute "transparency" will allow not to dwell on any one producer-monopolist - all countries will use the development on equal terms. <br>  For a couple of hundreds of years, the evolution of man does not exactly follow his desires, so that at the birth of a child, strictly in the order of the general line, these very ‚Äúpoints‚Äù will be implanted.  This will be done by a painless injection - once and for all.  Having reached the programmed coordinates of the center of the brain, the ‚Äúpoint‚Äù will become a single point with it without conflict and will allow you to instantly process any information of any volume in the future.  No separate fuel cells will be needed - more than enough human heat. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b0e/cdf/72b/b0ecdf72b35010be45c05c3c04ddca77.jpg" alt="image"><br>  In addition to the computational "datacenter", through the injection, other crumbs will get into the human body, allowing you to store more information than a person can get in his entire life.  No, these are not ‚Äúsmall‚Äù large hard drives or even solid-state drives ‚Äî a kind of fundamentally new type of media capable of providing an infinitely large number of free-spin recording and reading cycles.  Those.  if a person wanted to remember in colors how he rested last summer in the posh oases of Mars - he would simply close his eyes and ‚Äúlook‚Äù in his mind that time, as if he were just there.  Due to the fact that these carriers will not operate with information in binary form, a person will be able during the ‚Äúsession‚Äù not only to see everything, but also mentally to hear, smell, touch, and so on.  Any freedom of action is a past that cannot be changed. <br>  What I personally like about this technology is the search system.  Yandex, of course, doesn‚Äôt smell there, but Google will probably add to the new generation of algorithms.  The point is the following - thanks to the flexible system of anchor-associative chains, and all the same inertialess memory, a person will be able to instantly find in himself any recorded information.  With the same speed with which we can now remember the event we need, even faster.  The hierarchy of data storage for each person will have its own - ‚Äúholidays‚Äù, ‚Äúdreams‚Äù, ‚Äúpersonal‚Äù, ‚Äúselective‚Äù - whatever the structure, it can be easily moved by the power of thought.  Accordingly, immediately it will be possible to view, ‚Äúrewind‚Äù, slow down.  Well, just in case, once a week, during sleep, the defragmentation process will be launched. <br><br><h3>  I sit high, I look away </h3><br>  Speaking of vision.  Now science knows exactly only two types of visual receptors - ‚Äúcones‚Äù and ‚Äúrods‚Äù.  The most inquisitive scientists are already betting on the existence of a third type of receptor, which is responsible for the human circadian rhythms.  All this, of course, is good, but discoveries are discoveries, and inventions are inventions.  The final component of the ‚Äúsoup kit from the syringe of the future‚Äù will be a certain amount of the fourth type of visual receptors (developed by scientists), which will still reach the destinations in the body.  They will also be incredibly small in size - concentrating a thin layer in front of the lens and filling a certain part of the eyeball, through specially formed nerve nanotubes (from the eyes to the "data center") with superconductivity properties at ordinary temperatures, these receptors will significantly expand the capabilities of human vision.  Firstly, they will allow us not to be limited only to the visible range of the spectrum - a person will be able to fully see the IR and UV spectrum, as well as, importantly, in the dark.  True, it is unlikely that a person will want to constantly see all this infrared-ultraviolet "porridge" that we do not see now.  But you can trust the "autopilot-subconscious", which, thanks to a smart processor, will constantly analyze the situation around the person and, if necessary, "highlight" the right one. <br>  A few more advantages of the fourth type of receptors are an ideal color rendition (with full coverage of fundamentally new color spaces), the ability to visually ‚Äúbring closer‚Äù the necessary objects (to see kilometers ahead, as well as to look at the smallest particles under a microscope).  Well, perhaps the most interesting thing is the ability to record everything that happens and is perceived in your memory. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/65d/803/00b/65d80300ba481c3dabddec91ab319ec1.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h3>  Inner voice </h3><br>  Since I started talking about the subconscious - perhaps I would be mistaken in describing the next experiment, but I can say for sure that something like this was done.  The volunteers were planted in front of a black screen and they needed to guess where the white point would appear at the next moment in time.  The percentage of failures was very large, but many participants of the experience blamed their consciousness for this.  Say, intuition told them the right answer, but at the last moment something prevented them from making the right decision. <br>  And now imagine that this very nanoelectronics in our organism will be able to manipulate the information and processes of our organism at all levels.  It is known that 90% of our behavior, habits and lifestyle are due to subconscious reactions and beliefs, and only 10% are caused by consciousness.  Having special super-productive handlers in our heads, we will be able to make the necessary adjustments to the processes occurring in the body, into the same subconscious.  Examples of application: we will be able to ‚Äúrecord‚Äù dreams, in cold evenings by the fireplace talk to ‚Äúyou‚Äù with an inner voice (intuition);  Questions "Did the iron turn off?"  shut the car? ‚Äùwill no longer;  We will be able to solve many issues much more confidently, disabling internal dialogues.  And the ‚Äúterrible‚Äù 25th frame will not be for us.  In general, rake attacks will be much less! <br>  Many people will probably like this plot - by going outside, you can unmistakably choose yourself a representative of the opposite sex who is right for us - the subconscious mind will help you analyze the emotional state of a potential interlocutor before meeting, drawing attention to hundreds of factors that we now I would not have thought - the diameter of the pupils, the frequency of breathing, some subconscious signs, movements, etc. <br>  It turns out that since birth a person will be endowed with everything necessary and will be able to devote any free moment of time to ‚Äúwatching‚Äù any episode of his life, starting from the very start.  Yes, so see that any current virtual worlds would cry if they had tears.  The ability to quickly analyze the past will allow a person not to waste time in vain and do only what he really needs, thereby obtaining great pleasure from life. <br>  All information will be stored in the person after his death (if this option is not removed by that time), the data will not be lost.  This will allow, if necessary, to remove the media and start them in the right direction.  For example, to disclose crimes (deliberate, I hope, by that time will not be).  Or, if there was no accident, it will be possible to get reliable information by asking the ‚Äúperson‚Äù to show a certain part of it to the public.  Apparently, this will be the first serious attempt to resolve the issue of corruption in Russia :) Perhaps it will even be possible to ‚Äúcut out‚Äù some unpleasant memories from the memory, losses ‚Äî just mentally ‚Äúpointed out‚Äù the unnecessary and removed it far away. <br>  Or one more practical application of information carriers - the compilation of them ... no, it definitely will not be Wikipedia.  It will be a ‚Äúvirtual‚Äù real world map - any person who is far from a certain place will be able to ‚Äúvisit‚Äù there with the eyes of those whose data is collected on this map. <br><br><h3>  Accept the file </h3><br>  As for the exchange of information - it will be really simple and easy.  It is impossible to call the secret information that the standards for the transmission of data through the human body are being actively developed abroad.  The Institute of Electronics and Electrical Engineering (IEEE) is engaged in this, and the name of the technology is <b>Body Area Network</b> (BNA).  Previously, input devices were inserted into the COM port, which was replaced by PS / 2, then USB and now peripheral devices use wireless data transmission via Bluetooth.  Drawing an analogy - the developed technology BNA, is only the progenitor-pioneer for the future technology branch, which will be replaced by more advanced interfaces.  By the way, while ‚Äúhuman speeds‚Äù leave much to be desired - only 2.5 Kb / s.  However, by the end of this year, scientists plan to increase this speed by more than 400 times.  Years will pass, and terabytes of recorded information can be transmitted through a simple touch.  What will this or similar technology give us?  At a minimum, a huge time saver.  Ease of communication and interaction.  You will be able to exchange with handshakes not only business cards, but also, for example, the necessary segments of the ‚Äúvideo‚Äù seen - just imagine what horizons will open at the same time!  Tell friends, more precisely, in all its glory show <br>  something funny is a matter of touch. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1c8/6bf/4da/1c86bf4da42eb7031731f1e3e018511a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  By the way, I am increasingly inclined to the conclusion that there will be no computers as a class - everything will be in the head of a person.  There will be no disputes about the convenience of a gadget.  There will be no need to stick films on sensitive displays, charge the device once every 2-3 days, catch signals.  Tiny microcircuits will instantly make all the necessary calculations - from delivery in the store to the necessary effort of some action to achieve the desired result.  Complex mathematical calculations of scientists will be "oral" with the ability to display decisions to colleagues.  No reminders, alarm clocks, sticky leaves will be needed - all this is perfectly capable of keeping our head. <br><br><h3>  Enter the Matrix </h3><br>  ‚Äú <i>Tank, I need a helicopter pilot training program</i> ‚Äù - relying on associations, try to find the necessary passage of life when you, without taking your eyes off, watched the iconic ‚ÄúMatrix‚Äù.  One day it will be the same in real life.  Imagine that Wikipedia will one day grow to the point that it will contain almost any information, all information about the world around it.  There will be a ‚Äúservice‚Äù that stores physically skills - languages ‚Äã‚Äãof the whole world, any kinds of sports, skills of driving all possible vehicles, programming, and so on. <br>  And in order not to litter the head with excess, a person can not keep it all at home, but ‚Äúorder‚Äù the skills needed at the moment, and from any place.  What will it lead to then?  I can not describe all this.  There will be an incredible saving of time - as soon as the bones of a newborn get stronger, he will be able to walk and talk.  You will not have to spend a dozen years of your life studying at school, another 5 at the institute.  No armies, no readings of books - if necessary, you need to "pull" and everything will be, moreover, in the right amount and at the maximum professional level. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f0c/1a0/405/f0c1a0405fd6894d52d9a2549a6b05bb.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h3>  Mom, I'm scared </h3><br>  Almost to every sentence of my dreams, you can say "damn, cool, but ...".  While science is at the level that only accumulates knowledge, ideas and ideas, we can sleep calmly.  When technological processes will ripen and everything accumulated earlier will be put into practice in a crowd - then the hot season will begin.  There is no doubt that sooner or later, the interfaces of interaction of technology with the human body will come into our life ... <br>  What all this will lead to, I am even afraid to imagine - everything is beautiful and cloudless only in fantasy.  In 1984, Stephen Levy, in his famous book, wrote several principles of hacker ethics, one of which reads: "All information should be free."  But if it happens that information will suddenly not be freely available, and the skills of "conversational English without an accent" and "ATV control" can only be bought as a module, it is already clear who will become the richest in the world. Although I don‚Äôt the hope is lost that money by that time will lose its value. <br>  The issue of security will be an edge - we can not allow people who have been freed from school and the institute, from idleness creating chaos with the effort of thought.  They probably will not invent any kind of super defense - as is known, a weapon will appear against any armor sooner or later.  And the developer, who knows how the most important defense works, would rule the world.  So hackers can probably relax, especially since their knowledge will be available to everyone, like the knowledge of any other profession.  I am increasingly inclined to think that money is devalued, and that the most expensive will be unique knowledge and skills. <br>  Perhaps unnecessary information from the gray matter of newborns will simply be erased even with the introduction <br>  "Points" after birth - so that humanity lived calmer.  Removed at the gene level and other unnecessary things that are still relevant - smoking, drugs, susceptibility to disease. <br>  I do not think that, having ceased to study at school, by pumping in himself any knowledge, a person will cease to strive for something.  People, how many do not live, all the time they come up with something.  I hope there will be no wars for a limited place under the sun, and people will understand that you can live peacefully and simply begin to develop new territories?  The planets are full, and the galaxies seem to be the same?  And there, you see, more developed life forms will meet?  In general, I assure you - I do not know what will happen.  In an interesting time, you know, we live.  Maybe for the better that we probably will not live to see that time. <br><br>  <b>*</b> <i>The winner, who won the first place, <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/asus/blog/63504/">refused</a> the prize and the honorary title, respectively, the places of the winners moved one step higher :) By the way, the prize for the first three places was ... laptops.</i> <br><br>  <b>**</b> Sorry, invites are out for now ( <br><br>  <b>***</b> Won <b><a href="http://whatdoyouthinkaboutfuture.com/retribution_n01/">Asus EeePC 1002HA</a></b> - I think the review is just around the corner ;-) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bf7/dd7/38f/bf7dd738ffbc55c97f51aa9256f51596.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Successes!</b> <br>  / Boomburum / </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/63552/">https://habr.com/ru/post/63552/</a></p>
