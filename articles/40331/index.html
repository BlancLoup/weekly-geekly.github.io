  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Why I bought myself an iPhone 1 / 2G, not an iPhone 3G</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Much has been written about the shortcomings of iPhones, as well as about merits.  All this is in the network, I will not repeat.  I want to talk about the shortcomings of the iPhone 3G compared to the iPhone 1 / 2G, which I encountered when I wanted to buy this phone. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  1. The GPS module was turned into a gunman.  Of course, on some YouTube video, when an AT &amp; T spokesperson drives around Los Angeles by car, the GPS works perfectly.  However, there are a lot of complaints and stories in the network that the satellite constantly loses you or GPS does not keep up with your car;) And of course, compared to standard car GPS, it is like heaven and earth, both in terms of functions and work. <br>  2. But this is not the worst.  GPS is initially tied to Google Maps, on which maps of Kiev and the suburbs are absolutely not worked out for it.  The question then is why is it needed? <br>  3. 3G connectivity is certainly cool, but why do I need it?  At my home Wi-Fi, in the office Wi-Fi, in the cafe Wi-Fi.  In addition, changing the operator or constantly rearranging SIM cards is unacceptable for me.  In addition, if there was no Wi-Fi, 3G coverage in Ukraine is quite small. <br>  4. The same 3G connection, according to the statements of foreign bloggers, is very battery tight.  As a result, it has to be charged once, or even twice a day.  It is generally already in any gate ... <br>  5. A couple of years ago, Steve Jobs remade iPods, replacing plastic cases with metal, if I'm not mistaken, aluminum.  And he did it due to the fact that the old iPods scratched hard.  With the iPhone, which is very surprising, he backed down by making the iPhone 3G, to the indignation of all phone fans, plastic.  In addition, on black plastic, except for scratches and scuffs, which will manifest with time, your fingerprints appear instantly.  It looks honestly unpleasant.  I do not use covers by the way! <br>  6. Due to the plastic case, the damage of the phone will lead to a deplorable effect, unlike aluminum. <br>  7. On the iPhone 3G, the screen gives off yellowness, just like all cheap TN matrices.  To fix it, you have to change it, but by default, I consider it a serious marriage. <br>  8. Many gadgets from past Apple products will not fit the new phone, for example, a docking station, which by the way is no longer supplied. <br>  9. The new iPhone has become pointed at the edges.  Now if you put it on the table, it will swing from side to side.  Work is not always convenient. <br>  10. By the way, the unlock is still not normal.  Now you can only unlock using universal sim technology. <br><br>  Pros iPhone 3G <br>  1. The ability to insert conventional headphones.

      As a result, I did not pay 500 bucks for these shortcomings, and I bought myself the first iPhone, which I am very satisfied with, and which is almost impossible to find on sale now.  Straight rarity;) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/40331/">https://habr.com/ru/post/40331/</a></p>
