Banner ad format blurred its boundaries, and the banners themselves became ‚Äúsmarter‚Äù <a name="habracut"></a>  : now they are able to adapt to the narrowest audiences, are able to independently select an audience for display, to build communication with the user, to personalize the message.  Display advertising is turning into an even more flexible and effective tool in the hands of virtuoso internet marketers.

      The range of tasks is not limited to ‚Äútraditional‚Äù banner advertising, creating a favorable image of a company or product, increasing the awareness of a product or service.  Everything is much wider. <br><br><h3>  <b>Mediyka: perception features</b> </h3><br>  The perception of banner advertising on the Internet remains the same as traditional display advertising.  Compare, for example, with search ads.  The motivation of a potential client in a search query is focused specifically on obtaining the desired result.  And he is ready to see your ad and click on it - of course, subject to the "tenacious" ad text.  Search advertising is successfully disguised as informational content - it is in the context of the momentary interest of the addressee. <br><br>  Banner advertising, no matter how high-tech it may be, works on a completely different vector of user perception.  Your message for him is the background ‚Äúnoise‚Äù; whether the message reaches the goal or not depends on a variety of objective and subjective factors. <br><br><h3>  <b>How to make advertising banners effective</b> </h3><br>  In psychology, the concept of "trigger" is used - a kind of "trigger", a provoking factor that automatically starts a certain model of behavior.  What triggers can you use to get attention and get the desired effect? <br><br>  <b>1. Guess needs.</b>  Accuracy of targeting to your audience.  Using the power of analytics and sample indicators.  Today is irrelevant social trend targeting.  Do you want to sell to men and women from 25 to 55 years old, with an income above the average?  All your competitors want this. <br><br>  But what if you aim at women who are interested in Italian recipes and offer them a gastronomic tour of Italy?  Or show the winter tires to the person who was looking for a new car in the summer? <br><br>  Invite buyers to repeat purchases from their base by offering exclusive conditions?  Create a portrait of clients, similar in behavioral characteristics to already existing customers, and target them with displays of advertising messages? <br><br>  <b>2. The effect of recognition.</b>  Creative for the sake of creativity makes sense except for the nomination for the Cannes Lions.  Advertising is relevant creative understanding of associative reactions and recognition effect. <br><br>  Recognizable brands, slogans, recognizable products or the right associative line for a new product will be useful for creating, perhaps, not remarkable, but working banners. <br><br>  How else can the recognition effect be used?  Surely everyone has seen "catching up" advertising?  You recently searched for a refrigerator, read book reviews, admired a dress, or picked up a complete set of a future car - and then you were haunted by advertising banners with the same pictures.  They attract attention because you know them, you click, and you may buy.  There are other uses.  Suppose you are broadcasting a video on television, do you have the opportunity to target active TV viewers and put an end to an audience that has already seen your television clip? <br><br>  <b>3. Bright promise.</b>  A properly built advertising message is a bright and eye-catching text; a deeply associative illustration motivates the user to click on the banner and go to the site.  Under the action or sale banner advertising can be an indispensable part of the overall concept of an advertising campaign.  The results of the study showed that 49% of respondents click on banners if they are interested in the offer and are confident in the security of the link.  Some respondents say that they are ready to follow the proposed link if the banner is not banal and bright. <br><br>  <b>4. Be visible.</b>  Speech about the correct location of the banner ads.  There are certain rules of placement, tightly tied to the perception of human consciousness through the visual organ.  Our view slides from the upper left to the lower right corner, and the brain is sharpened so that the illustrations located on the left side of the page of the site do not cause ‚Äúbanner blindness.‚Äù  The user sees them better and the probability that he will click on your banner is higher.  Needless to say, the Internet portal on which you place a banner filled with similar advertisements to failure will cause not only blindness, but also dizziness for the user. <br><br>  The correct location of the banner is on the periphery of our view, we do not forget that the user came to the site not for the sake of our advertising?  Preferably in the upper or left part, and well, if cumulatively on the page is placed no more than 1-3 advertising banners. <br><br>  <b>5. Change of scenery.</b>  Studies and observations show that user engagement falls on the 10-12th day of banner broadcasting.  Then they, as they say, ‚Äúbecome boring‚Äù and cease to attract attention.  Does this mean that creativity should be launched with flyyty and regularly updated - depends on the objectives of the advertising campaign.  For the sustaining effect, frequent updates are not required; for an aggressive advertising campaign, this is a factor that strongly influences efficiency. <br><br>  Banners that are automatically generated from the data feed do not need to be updated frequently.  There is a different approach, not mass coverage, and the repetition of "familiar" content will be more likely to be on hand. <br><br><h3>  <b>findings</b> </h3><br>  Whatever advertising channels you choose, today it is crucial to collect data, know everything about your audience, analyze and apply in building a strategy.  Socio-demographic targetings leave priority positions and give way to behavioral characteristics, to predict which you need to know your client "by sight". <br><br>  <i>‚Ä¢ Customize your ad dot, measure, count, analyze.</i>  <i>Only then will there be a complete understanding of the effectiveness and profitability of advertising.</i> <br>  When placing banner advertisements, it is necessary to distinguish between the notions: ‚Äúto catch attention‚Äù - this does not mean to motivate the user to go to the site and does not mean to get a client.  At the same time, a small number of transitions do not always indicate the failure of an advertising campaign.  Banner advertising rarely leads the user directly to the purchase, and most often participates in the chain of user touches to the brand, which will not need 1 or 2 in order to move from acquaintance to purchase. <br><br>  <i>‚Ä¢ Match your goals at a specific stage of the advertising campaign, technical and visual implementation of banner placement.</i> <br>  Banners are no longer the simple and clear advertising product that it seemed to be just recently.  And, of course, not a universal promotion tool.  The study of modern technological capabilities gives marketers more channels of interaction with the audience, a broader toolkit for solving diverse problems. <br><br>  <i>‚Ä¢ Test products, combine and alternate with other types of advertising, both online and offline.</i> <br><br>  Display advertising makes its own demands: careful planning, preparation of creative, sufficient budget, time to evaluate performance.  Rate your resources and willingness to wait for the result for more than one month. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/342706/">https://habr.com/ru/post/342706/</a></p>
