Before the first investment is still far away, and constantly buying advertising from you will not pull the budget.  In general, a typical situation is a typical startup.  It is here that many people remember that there are viral mechanisms for attracting users. <br><br>  There are quite a few such mechanisms, but we will consider one that, with the advent of such sites as ProductHunt, has in a sense reached a new level.  This is, of course, about side projects.  Under the cut, we will look at how different companies and people use a similar mechanism to attract new users and, of course, tell about their results and show specific numbers. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><hr><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/233/9bc/fdc/2339bcfdc55743f4990235d5136d123d.png">

      <a href="http://emojiparty.club/">emojiparty.club</a> <br><br>  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe site is extremely simple and trivial - there are many smiles on the page that move to the beat of the music.  In this case, the user can choose which ones will be smiles.  The site was developed by designer and developer Charlie Clark. <br><br>  It should be noted that the performance of this project is quite impressive - having appeared in November, he received 110,000 visits in the first month of its existence.  However, the life span of such projects is not long due to the minimal retention of the user and in December his traffic has already dropped to 25 thousand. <br><br>  About 61% of traffic comes from direct visits, about 24% comes from social.  networks, and 11.5% from other sites.  The site received an initial push due to the fact that it was written on avclub.com <br><br><hr><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a66/2ff/502/a662ff5023b34d22b4c8b4d5cb31a51d.png"><br><br>  <a href="https://better-error-pages.statuspage.io/">better-error-pages.statuspage.io</a> <br><br>  The project allows for a couple of minutes to create an error page for your own site.  It was developed by statuspage.io, the purpose of which is to provide customers with an easy way to create a site status page. <br><br>  In July, the project was visited 15,000 times, but by December attendance had dropped to only 3,000.  But you must agree, a good result, considering that the promotion of this mini-project was not invested at all, and the developers most likely have already forgotten about it. <br><br>  38% of traffic comes from other sites, and 25% from social.  networks (almost completely from Facebook).  It is worth noting that 40% of traffic comes from Asia.  This is due to the fact that the site is lit on the pages of lifehacker.jp <br><br><hr><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/afa/bdf/0e0/afabdf0e05804243b495ae0dcc606597.png"><br><br>  <a href="http://www.startupbreeding.com/">www.startupbreeding.com</a> <br><br>  A funny site that randomly displays 2 IT companies to the user, so that he can be inspired by them and, as the next startup, make their symbiosis. <br><br>  In August, the site received 85,000 visits and, like any other similar project, began to quickly lose ground - in September, attendance was only 6,000, and in December the site was visited 2,000 times.  But agree, not bad for a site that can be done in a couple of evenings. <br><br>  Almost 30% of the traffic comes to other sites, and most of it is still the same Japanese Lifehacker.jp because of which 45% of users fall on Japan. <br><br><hr><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c30/e4c/31f/c30e4c31f891496ca6bb2ed68abd3466.png"><br><br>  <a href="http://startupden.ru/quiz/">startupden.ru/quiz</a> <br><br>  The project is a test quiz, where the user needs to compare the fact and the company to which he belongs.  Launched in the framework of the Russian publication about business, IT and start-ups. <br><br>  It was launched recently and, unfortunately, it‚Äôs too early to talk about any results, but almost half of the traffic comes from various social services.  networks and almost all visitors are new. <br><br>  In conclusion, I would like to reiterate a simple truth - they are not united with advertising.  Pay attention to viral and organic mechanisms to attract users.  Such projects cost about a week of work for 1-2 specialists, and the traffic to your website may attract quite a few.  Moreover, the effect of such a project will not run dry completely even after months when you already forget about it. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/297924/">https://habr.com/ru/post/297924/</a></p>
