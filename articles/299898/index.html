Given the current capabilities, most salespeople and marketers look helpless.  Next, I will explain why this is happening and what can be done to maximize your sales.  Let us consider the example of work in the service <a href="http://www.carrotquest.io/%3Futm_source%3Dmegam%26utm_medium%3Dcontent%26utm_content%3D1%26utm_campaign%3Dscoring">Carrot Quest</a> . <br><a name="habracut"></a>

If the sales people get at least some data on the leads (name, company), they are happy about that.  Unfortunately, there is no question of a detailed segmentation of the leads. <br><br><h2>  <b>What does this result in</b> </h2><br>  The sales department spends its time working with one not differing mass of users, and this is completely inefficient.  It is likely that most of these leads are not yet ready for purchase, these users still need to ‚Äúwarm up‚Äù and calmly lead to the sale, and the seller‚Äôs standard offer will only frighten them away.  As a result, the salesman‚Äôs time is not spent efficiently, and the conversion to the purchase leaves much to be desired. <br><br><br><h2>  <b>How to work effectively with leads</b> </h2><br>  We recommend filtering Lida by 2 stages. <br><ol><li>  Readiness lead to purchase; </li><li>  For additional properties.  For example, what product does it look like, what has it read about a product on the site, how well is it informed, etc. </li></ol><br>  This is how we do it in our own <a href="http://www.carrotquest.io/%3Futm_source%3Dmegam%26utm_medium%3Dcontent%26utm_content%3D1%26utm_campaign%3Dscoring"><b>Carrot Quest</b></a> service.  For those who are not familiar yet, this is a service that collects key information about visitors to your site and on the basis of it helps to bring users to the purchase. <br><br><br><h2>  Lead readiness for purchase </h2><br>  For any user action on the site, you can automatically add a certain score to his profile.  Such user actions can be divided into groups: <br><ul><li>  Unimportant actions, the user shows interest, but is not yet ready to purchase (it can be a subscription to newsletters, browse the product catalog, view the first page of the site to the end and many others.) - you give 1-2 points to such actions; </li><li>  Important actions, the user shows an active interest, it makes sense to contact him and help (this can be incomplete ordering, viewing delivery methods, left application, etc.) - you assign 10-20 points to such actions. </li></ul><br>  In the service Carrot Quest points can be any, as well as user actions.  You customize them depending on your features. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/817/af1/66e/817af166eb45551381aa5df7852a8d55.png" alt="image"><br><br><br><br>  As a result, the more a user performs key actions in a service, the greater his overall score becomes - this is the first signal for the seller to take over the game and ‚Äúclose‚Äù the sale. <br><br>  In the service, you can immediately filter the leads by their scores and continue working only with the ‚Äúhottest‚Äù users, or vice versa, segment out the ‚Äúcoolest‚Äù and systematically bring them to the purchase. <br><br>  Also points are displayed on each user's card.  When working individually, it helps employees to instantly assess the lead. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/980/d94/3ef/980d943efdd6ad4031fbf66ba9405bbe.png" alt="image"><br><br><br><br>  You can customize this process as you see fit, because there is no consensus on how many points guarantee that the lead is ‚Äúhot‚Äù, all this is entirely individual. <br><br><br><h2>  Filtering users by additional properties </h2><br>  For maximum personalization, you can select different segments in the service and continue to work with them. <br><br>  Think about what information about users will help you understand their interests, level of awareness and other factors to personalize communication and bring them to the purchase. <br><br>  For example: <br><ul><li>  The user has moved from contextual advertising on request for a particular product.  This means that he is already looking for a specific product and all you have to do is convince him of buying from you; </li><li>  The user has read the information about your service and fully understands what you are offering.  It means that it is not necessary for such a user to tell the information that is in the section about the company; </li><li>  The user comes to you for the 5th time, which is not typical for your sphere.  It means that he has a problem and needs to help him; </li><li>  The user has read the letter with a commercial offer from you; </li><li>  Such examples can be infinite, because  it all depends on your scope and features. </li></ul><br>  All this can be easily configured and then quickly work with saved segments.  As with points, you can select a group of users and work with it or watch information on the user individually - in his card. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/249/910/97b/24991097b6974723a9177feca3bece42.png" alt="image"><br><br>  With pleasure, the team of <a href="http://www.carrotquest.io/%3Futm_source%3Dmegam%26utm_medium%3Dcontent%26utm_content%3D1%26utm_campaign%3Dscoring"><b>Carrot Quest</b></a> - service that collects key information about your users and on the basis of it helps to individually bring users to the purchase (both automatically and manually). <br><br><br><br><br><br>  <b>Other useful materials from Carrot Quest:</b> <br>  1. <a href="http://www.carrotquest.io/blog/kak-veb-studiya-za-4-shaga-uvelichila-kolichestvo-zayavok-v-25-raza-i-povysila-srednij-chek/">As a web studio, in 4 steps, increased the number of applications by 2.5 times and increased the average bill;</a> <br>  2. <a href="http://www.carrotquest.io/blog/6-psixologicheskix-fishek-v-prodazhax-kotorye-pomogut-vam-vyjti-na-novyj-uroven/">6 psychological chips in sales that will help you to reach a new level;</a> <br>  3. <a href="http://www.carrotquest.io/blog/obnovlenie-kapelnyj-marketing-sozdanie-cepochek-soobshhenij/">Drip marketing.</a>  <a href="http://www.carrotquest.io/blog/obnovlenie-kapelnyj-marketing-sozdanie-cepochek-soobshhenij/">Creating message chains and advanced sales scenarios</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/299898/">https://habr.com/ru/post/299898/</a></p>
