  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Firefox screen space distribution at high resolution</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Now, in the comments on the new Yandex main page, many comments are left on the fact that the new version looks bad on high resolution monitors because of the huge empty fields on the sides.  However, even if Yandex gives the user the opportunity to choose for himself, leave the fields or stretch the main one for the entire width, this will not solve the field problem globally: fixed width is used by many sites (including giants like YouTube and Facebook), and the vast majority of nothing to choose from.  And without a fixed width, everything often turns out to be even worse - just try reading the LJ-post, the lines of which are stretched across the entire width of the FullHD monitor.  What to do? <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The most common advice is to maximize the browser window.  But many people like to maximize all windows, besides, fragments of other windows on the sides of the browser can annoy much more than white fields (in Windows 7, however, it became more convenient to cope with the latter: by Win + Home, all windows except active are minimized).  Is there any other remedy? <br>  Yes there is.  It does not completely solve the problem, but it also kills a couple of other birds with one stone.  It consists in the following: to use in Firefox one of the extensions that allow placing the tab bar on the side and on the top.  On a monitor with a resolution of 1920x1200 when using the Tab Kit extension it looks like this (clickable): 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
     <a href=""><img src="http://img231.imageshack.us/img231/9387/tabkit.png"></a> <br><br>  What are the advantages? <br>  First, the white fields on the sides become much smaller.  Completely do not disappear, but cease to hit on the eyes.  And if the site does not have a fixed width, the lines of text on it become shorter, and in this case it is much more convenient to read them. <br>  Secondly, the tab bar, moving to the side space, usually occupied simply by the margins, frees up a little distance in height - and it is much more valuable when displaying sites. <br>  Thirdly, if you open many tabs at once when using the sidebar, their headings are not shortened and remain readable. <br>  Fourthly, the dimensions of the usual tab bar are set fairly tightly (you can only change the number of rows), and in the case of the side panel, you can set it exactly the width you want. <br>  Fifthly, the sidebar of the tabs allows you to comfortably use the ‚Äútab trees‚Äù (the purple tree can be seen in the screenshot), where the tabs are grouped according to the ancestor and when there is a shortage of space, they can be easily folded into one, it is visual and convenient. <br><br>  What kind of extensions are suitable for this?  Prefer the above Tab Kit;  it is not officially suited to new versions of Firefox, but it was launched against its will using the Nightly Tester Tools (on Habr√© it was also <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/firefox/81806/">reported</a> that the Add-on Compatibility Reporter is suitable for its forcible launch).  There is a Tree Style Tab, similar to the Tab Kit - IMHO, inferior to it, but it is compatible with new versions.  There are Vertical Tabbar and VertTabbar, but I have not personally tried them, and they are not compatible with new versions. <br><br>  You can make the tab bar vertical in Opera as well, where this option is present in the settings initially.  Google Chrome at the time did not find such an extension, but since then, it may have already appeared.  Safari and IE can't do this with standard tools. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/88985/">https://habr.com/ru/post/88985/</a></p>
