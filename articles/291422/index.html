  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to share one tablet with all family members and children?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In my family, one tablet on Android and two children (3 and 6 years old).  Until a certain point in time, the interests of children and mine in games did not overlap.  Children played children's educational games, and I played casuals and farms.  But the children grew up and they became interested in my games.  They wanted to build their cities and farms, and I own.  I didn‚Äôt want to buy a new tablet, so that everyone could play the same game but develop it in their own way.  Also on the tablet were applications in which children could mess things up (mail, readers, browser, file managers, social networks, etc.).  I did not want them to have access to them.  Therefore, I will talk about the decision that I applied as a result of which everyone was satisfied and everyone can play the same game on the same tablet. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/612/9c6/f36/6129c6f36c6f409b9048a2b1c77490c6.jpg"><br><br>  Details under the cut ... <br><a name="habracut"></a>

      In Android 4.4, there was a great opportunity - several users on one device. <br>  How to setup.  Go to "Settings" - "Users" and add the users we need.  In our case, this is "Children" and "Dad." <br><br>  Since the tablet has already installed many children's apps, and I didn‚Äôt want the kids to lose their progress in the games, I left them on the Owner account, and I got myself an additional user ‚ÄúDad‚Äù.  Under both accounts, Children and Dad will log in under the same Google Play account (so that you can put games already purchased under my account on the children's account).  Shopping on Google Play is password protected. <br><br>  So that children could not just go under my user, I set a numeric password on him. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/040/f2e/c0b/040f2ec0bc09432d91d45f0f1ea49bb8.png"><br><br>  This great feature allows you to install the same application under different users on one device and it will use different storages and, accordingly, the progress for the same game will be saved for each user individually.  The installation of a game or an application also looks cool if it has already been downloaded under a different user.  No need to wait.  It is installed instantly. <br><br>  Here is a list of children's apps: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/22d/c48/fed/22dc48fed9114307a0172c77247d075b.png"><br><br>  And this is a list of my applications: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cf2/af3/e6b/cf2af3e6b39a40daaf6199a9f9b8022e.png"><br><br>  With users sorted out.  Everyone can now play the same game on one device and everyone will have their own progress. <br><br>  But what about the security of a child account?  After all, children can run a third-party application, settings, and still nahimichit on the device. <br><br>  The problem is solved with the help of the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.whisperarts.kidsshell">Kid's Shell</a> application for the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.whisperarts.kidsshell">children's launcher</a> . <br>  The application replaces the standard launcher and allows children to run only those applications that parents brought to the desktop.  Thus, children will only play in what the parent has allowed and brought to the desktop. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/539/209/5f7/5392095f7b3349e88ec617925c574929.jpg"><br><br>  Another great advantage of the application - is the limitation of work on time.  For example, you can set the allowed hours for the game and the maximum amount of time that you can spend behind the tablet per day. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a1c/59f/a3a/a1c59fa3adc04b548f70c41b823d6d62.png"><br><br>  By the way, there is also an adult version of the application (for business) <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.whisperarts.bizshell">Business Taxi Shell</a> .  It has the same capabilities as Kid's Shell, but is focused on business. <br><br>  That is how I solved my problem.  And how do you share the tablet with all family members and children?  Write in the comments. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/291422/">https://habr.com/ru/post/291422/</a></p>
