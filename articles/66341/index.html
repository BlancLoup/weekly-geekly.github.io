  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Why Apple iTouch Tablet will be the flagship product</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  ‚ÄúDigital content has been available for many years, but there is still no proper (convenient) home appliance to consume digital information.  We still cut down trees and manually deliver newspapers to people's homes.  Is this normal for 1900, but not in 2009?  Apple is preparing to release the tablet iTouch Tablet which should change the whole society. <br><br>  Let's draw conclusions by connecting the latest news, leaks and rumors about the Apple tablet. <br>  In March, Reuters reported that <a href="http://www.deepapple.com/news/33503.html">Apple ordered a substantial batch of 10 inch touch-screens</a> in Taiwan for delivery in Q3 2009. <br>  In April, the Wall Street Journal reported that <a href="http://www.ixbt.com/news/market/index.shtml%3F11/80/20">Steve Jobs was actively involved in the development of the Tablet</a> . <br>  In July, the China Times newspaper reported that <a href="http://www.deepapple.com/news/34643.html">Apple, after successfully concluding contracts with manufacturers Foxconn, Wintek, and Dynapack</a> , in October will organize a presentation of its new product for $ 800. <br>  TheStreet.com reports that <a href="http://www.nbprice.ru/info/details/35831.htm">Apple will sell a subsidized Tablet</a> through the Verizon operator. <br>  At a press conference about Apple‚Äôs latest earnings report (a week ago), Apple‚Äôs top managers began to smash netbooks, but they refused to deny the Tablet that was about to be released (Tablet), saying only that they would release products that are "innovative and that they are proud of them." <br>  All these respected sources are trustworthy, and obviously reveal the secret of the upcoming new product from Apple. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Can the future Tablet have a significant impact on Apple‚Äôs core business?  I see that this device will take a higher place in the product line of the iPod family;  This will be a larger version of the iPod Touch.  But it will not be an ordinary device.  The launch of the iTouch Tablet will be the most significant achievement in the history of Apple. <br>  There are four reasons to justify these expectations: <br><br>  1) Apple finally has an app machine. <br>  Steve Jobs mentioned that in his career he had never seen anything like the success of the App Store.  If he said so, then I say that this 9.7 inch iTouch, which was designed to make optimal use of applications, will become Apple‚Äôs flagship product.  We are witnessing a transition to a new way of using the Internet.  Mobile content requires adapting and changing user experience that has been accumulated for the traditional website model.  Although we are accustomed to surfing the web, browsing websites on our PC, consumers show the advantage of using the App Store application usage model.  Mobile apps are designed for ease of use, and the 1.5 billion downloads so far from the Apple AppStore clearly demonstrate high user satisfaction.  The trend shows that consumers want to use applications, rather than visit the website.  Perhaps we will one day see that applications are actually more popular than websites.  The unspoken secret of iPhone popularity is that it was not designed to be the ultimate device for the AppStore.  The screen is too small.  The project assumed that the iPhone was primarily a phone, secondly an iPod, and thirdly a device for Applications, and fourthly, an Internet browser.  And this new iTouch is mainly designed to use games from the AppStore, books, read news, be used for entertainment, work in social networks, etc ...

      2) Mobile high-speed connection. <br>  Until now, the present portable Internet device has not been available due to the lack of availability of high-speed networks.  The new technology of Mi-Fi from Verizon, it seems to completely change the reality, because it allows Wi-Fi-connection anytime and anywhere.  And it seems that this iTouch will mark the beginning of a fruitful relationship between Verizon and Apple.  Connecting anytime, anywhere, will allow this device to serve as an instant e-reader.  By next year, we will all be wondering how the newspaper industry could survive using the outdated paper model of newspaper delivery.  iTouch will replace all newspapers, magazines, and books.  Imagine a college student not having to carry textbooks worth $ 600 each semester.  Assume that now there is no need to load magazines at the airport.  Digitization of education and media finally arrived.  This is the first device that fully satisfies digital readers while on the move.  Amazon`s black and white Kindle was a bad attempt that shouldn‚Äôt even be analyzed.  The same can be said about the netbook device. <br><br>  3) Free communication. <br>  Why do I think iTouch will be a more meaningful device than an iPhone?  Since the trend of development of communications technology is directed from cellular communication devices to using the Internet.  With Skype, you can make phone calls over an Internet connection, and with the help of Apple iChat, you can use the video connection for free.  There are no overpayments, there are no hidden fees, you only pay for your Internet connection and communicate at will.  Rumors are circulating that the next generation iTouch will include a camera and microphone, thus making this feature a reality for Apple customers. <br><br>  4) No exclusive operators. <br>  There is no doubt that iPhone sales have suffered because of an exclusive agreement between Apple and its seller.  There are millions of Verizon and Sprint customers in the US who would like to have an iPhone, but don‚Äôt want to switch to AT &amp; T.  It seems that iTouch will be openly accessible to all.  All those people who wanted an iPhone, but could not switch to another operator, will be attracted to the iTouch Tablet (tablet).  Apple will struggle to produce enough devices to satisfy consumers. <br><br>  Being a member of the iPod family means that this new iTouch will be announced during a typical presentation of iPod product updates, i.e.  during the first full week of September.  I assume that the presentation of Steve Jobs, who returned, that would bring a new revolutionary product, will force the stock market into motion.  Seeing the queues lined up early in the morning to buy the first iTouch Tablet will make the stock market worry again in October. <br>  The conclusion is simple.  Apple owned the technical revolution.  When there was an unprecedented growth of dot-coms that went out of control at the beginning of the decade, then everything was done correctly, but the infrastructure was not ready to make a digital transition.  Now that the infrastructure is ready, society will adopt the iTouch Tablet, which will begin a journey that may surprise even a visionary visionary ‚Äù:) <br><br>  <b>PS: A</b> selection of 34 news that has accumulated over the past 2 years, in which rumors or indirect confirmation of an upcoming release of the Apple iTablet Tablet PC or Apple iTouch Tablet have surfaced, can be found in the topic: <br>  <b><a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/iTablet/47111/">"Apple iTablet Tablet News"</a></b> . <br><br>  <b>PPS:</b> Do not judge too harshly, rather, I presented you not even a translation of the article, but probably a retelling close to the text :) <br>  Well, if anyone has outstanding abilities in English, then he can translate the article more accurately, and I am even ready to remove this topic (if a more accurate translation appears) :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/66341/">https://habr.com/ru/post/66341/</a></p>
