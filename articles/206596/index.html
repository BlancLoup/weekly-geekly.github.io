And the Q702 is not an ultrabook, and its display is not just a display.  Everything is not what it seems: the upper half of the ‚Äúultrabook‚Äù is a 11.6-inch tablet computer, and the lower half is nothing more than a docking station for it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/125/3c4/0bc/1253c40bc33efa8662a79f6ae3e0676a.jpg"><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Hybrid tablets have long been novices in the market, but they have not yet managed to get out of the role of an expensive toy, for a number of reasons.  Fujitsu, as usual, went its own way, creating a serious business product based on a fashionable concept.  According to the developers, Fujitsu STYLISTIC Q702 should be as convenient as possible to use anytime and anywhere.  And on this they have worked as it should.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f55/5ef/fb7/f555effb7f65574eafa75df4251f6ed8.jpg"><habracut><br><br>  In general, hybrid tablets are a clear answer to the question of why Microsoft created Windows 8 in general and the tiled interface (formerly Metro) in particular.  Q702 is no exception: it and Windows 8 fit together perfectly.  Metro is great for the tablet, and after installing the Q702 in the dock, you can simply go to the desktop and continue working in the usual way. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c23/df7/04b/c23df704b5a28ffaf4c6b3890a3883c2.jpg"><habracut><br><br>  Separated from the dock, the Q702 looks like a relatively heavyweight (850 g) and thick (12.7 mm) tablet with a very powerful filling.  Q702 is really designed for serious work, and therefore no Atom is put into it, it is based on a full-fledged Intel Core processor.  And there is a choice from i3-3227U to i5-3437U - power and, accordingly, power consumption, you can choose based on your requirements.  The installed 4 GB DDR3-1600 MHz RAM ‚Äúshould be sufficient for all‚Äù, and the volume of the solid-state drive varies in the range from 64 to 256 GB.  Among the available SSD is a model with hardware-based content encryption (FDE), which will be appreciated by businessmen and professionals working with confidential data. <br><br>  Despite the powerful processor, the Q702 cooling system does not give signs of life during normal operation, it is almost inaudible.  But under high load the fan accelerates and noise appears, noticeable, but still low enough for such a powerful computer - most ultrabooks are noisier.  After long-term work with demanding applications, the Q702's body heats up slightly above body temperature, which does not cause discomfort, even if you put it on your lap. <br><br>  The communication capabilities, which are extremely important for a mobile device (and doubly important for its business use), are practically exhaustive for Q702.  It can be connected to the network in three ways: a dual-band Wi-Fi adapter (802.11 a / b / g / n), a 3G / LTE adapter based on the Sierra Wireless MC7710 chip, and the good old Gigabit Ethernet.  There is also Bluetooth 4.0, suitable for connecting all sorts of wireless accessories. <br><br>  Like any self-respecting tablet, Fujitsu STYLISTIC Q702 is equipped with two cameras - front and rear.  Applications for them can be mass, from video calls and barcode scanning to shooting videos and taking photos.  But what other tablet computers do not have is a fingerprint scanner - Fujitsu has bypassed everyone.  The function is not only safe, but also convenient: a complex password is easily forgotten, and fingers are always with you, if you do not take into account the brutal scenarios of action-packed films.  In addition, a set of sensors includes an accelerometer, a gyroscope, a light sensor and a GPS receiver. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a7b/cab/f0f/a7bcabf0fcfe062ca1a376c946dc15c1.jpg"><habracut><br><br>  The top panel of the tablet is devoid of any elements, on the bottom panel there is a dock connector and docking slots.  In the same place the slot for the SIM card, covered with a plastic lid is hidden.  On the left side there is only a USB 3.0 port, a card reader slot and a power adapter connector.  The main wealth of buttons and connectors is located on the right side of the case: there is an Ethernet port, HDMI, power slider, volume buttons and picture rotation locking buttons, a wireless switch and mini-jacks for a microphone and headphones. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/854/70d/152/85470d15290fa10a2b439efdfb673469.jpg"><habracut><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/935/ae4/99a/935ae499ada47d1223738fbbedb6e649.jpg"><habracut><br><br>  The share of the docking station got an indispensable VGA port and USB 2.0 for Fujitsu products of this class (on the left side, next to the power adapter connector), an Ethernet port and another USB 2.0 (on the right side).  In general, this dock is not an easy thing.  In addition to the ports and almost full-size keyboard, it contains a second battery, which is discharged in front of the tablet battery, and charges after it.  Due to this, the battery life of the Q702 when installed in the dock increases from 4 hours to almost 10, which is a very decent figure for such a powerful device. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9e0/d4b/e06/9e0d4be0686f0ecd54f941c932c24e23.jpg"><habracut><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fc6/753/2ab/fc67532ab256051b4e458056431900e3.jpg"><habracut><br><br>  Having carefully considered the right side of the dock, you can find in it a slot with an inductive pen inside.  This is, in fact, already the calling card of Fujitsu mobile computers: the Q702 display is equipped with a touch layer using Wacom technology, which allows you to precisely position the pen and record the pressure.  The pen holds firmly in the slot and pops out of it only when the latch is moved. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d43/854/164/d438541644f1cd72ffd7321882151819.jpg"><habracut><br><br>  Speaking of display.  He's matte again!  Because of this, the picture loses a little visually, but you should try to exploit the tablet in daylight, and the reason for this decision becomes clear.  The Q702 display is based on an IPS TFT-matrix with a resolution of 1366x768 pixels, the brightness reaches 400 cd / sq.  m, the contrast is 500: 1.  This is quite enough to work in the bright sun, although you shouldn't take it to the beach, save your eyesight! <br><br>  Hybrid Q702 - perhaps the most important of its property.  You just worked with ‚Äúheavy‚Äù software packages, typed in text or edited the code - and now you pulled the tablet off the dock and surfed the Internet with all the comforts, watch movies and read books.  Only by using a hybrid tablet, you realize that only such a device can be truly universal. </habracut></habracut></habracut></habracut></habracut></habracut></habracut></habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/206596/">https://habr.com/ru/post/206596/</a></p>
