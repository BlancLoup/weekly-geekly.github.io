Here is the link for those who missed the <a href="http://www.appleinsider.ru/eto-interesno/pozvolit-li-takoj-perexodnik-podklyuchit-iphone-k-lokalnoj-seti.html">news</a> . <br><br><h4>  Introduction </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/0a11b7fe/137270a5/730c6db9/0f8692a7.jpg" align="right">  In short, what kind of cable is it and what is it for.  This cable allows you to use Apple devices to gain access to the console of various network devices, such as routers, switches, multiplexers and modems.  It is worth mentioning that this is not about ‚Äúhome‚Äù devices, but about professional network equipment that is used in telecom operators, corporate networks, data centers.  Manufacturers of such devices are both international vendors (Juniper, Cisco, Zyxel), and domestic (Natex). <br><br>  Why do I need access to the device through the console?  The main thing is the initial setup of the device (setting of IP parameters, logins and passwords) and restoration of access to the device in case of any accident (lost / forgotten password, the device is not accessible by IP, software recovery).

    <a name="habracut"></a><br>  The review will begin with a description of the process of buying this cable.  You can buy the cable either through the manufacturer‚Äôs <a href="http://redpark.com/">website</a> , the <a href="http://redpark.com/">Redpark</a> company, or through the website of the cable application developer, <a href="http://get-console.com/">Get-Console</a> .  Cable cost $ 59.  We ordered through Redpark due to lower shipping costs.  Unfortunately, Redpark does not deliver to Russia, so I had to use the services of <a href="http://shipito.com/">shipito.com</a> .  Total shipping cost is $ 47.  For comparison, shipping via Get Console costs $ 72.  Total got $ 106, delivery took 2 weeks. <br><br>  The package is as follows: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/5122da6c/157fe9fe/280fbc1b/abfcc57f.jpg"><br><br>  Brief instruction: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/e1736753/a3d59f33/e1116ef5/a585729e.png"><br><br>  Let's move closer to the point, more precisely to testing the cable itself.  On the one hand, the cable is terminated with a standard RJ-45 connector, on the other hand, Apple's 30-pin dock connector.  Cable length 182 cm. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/d2bd2761/76b218c4/3410a0cc/f2115a3b.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/b1321ed7/f89116cd/48b56fc2/934ec855.jpg"><br><br>  Inside the case with a dock-connector, there is a board with a microcontroller ( <a href="http://www.st.com/internet/mcu/product/164483.jsp">STM32F101C8</a> ) and an RS-232 driver ( <a href="http://www.ti.com/product/max3243e">MAX3243ECPWR</a> ): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/9c1904f9/76bc46d4/16bbd188/650666f7.png"><br><br>  To work with the cable, you must install the terminal program Get Console.  The program is available through the <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/get-console/id412067943%3Fmt%3D8">AppStore</a> for $ 9.99.  The program has a large number of settings and functions.  From the main it is worth noting: <br><ul><li>  connectivity through the console, Telnet and SSH </li><li>  support speeds from 9600 to 57600 kbps </li><li>  logging console output to a file </li><li>  ability to set frequently used commands and passwords </li><li>  virtual keys TAB, CTRL, BRAKE,?, ‚Üë, ‚Üì, CTRL + SHIFT + 6 </li><li>  sharing current session </li></ul>  Note that in the context of testing, the capabilities of the Get Console program for establishing a connection using the Telnet and SSH protocols were deliberately not considered. <br><br><h4>  Get Console Features Overview </h4><br>  The appearance of the program is simple and concise.  Due to the size of the screen, the appearance of the program is slightly different in iPad and iPhone / iPod. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/7ebb0ee1/85057cdd/2dcc9b66/ff649507.png"><br><br>  Consider the look of the interface on the iPad.  In the upper part of the left-to-right icons are placed: <br><ol><li>  Console Connection Status </li><li>  Program settings </li><li>  Session Management Menu </li><li>  Hide / Show Keyboard </li><li>  Hide / Show Special Keys Panel </li><li>  List of frequently used commands </li><li>  Sending CTRL + SHIFT + 6 </li><li>  File manager </li><li>  Password List </li><li>  File storage with console output logs </li></ol>  On the right is the clipboard manager panel.  Below the panel of special keys.  Below we consider the functions in more detail. <br><br>  <u>Console Connection Status</u> <br>  The connection status menu displays information about the time elapsed since the beginning of the session, the connection speed, the number of bytes transmitted and received, the PIN code for sharing the session. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/e59c599f/f62cc373/23e823e1/f764eb52.png"><br><br>  <u>Program settings</u> <br>  The following sections are available in the program settings: <br><ul><li>  console connection options </li><li>  terminal parameters </li><li>  keyboard settings </li><li>  session sharing options </li><li>  program information </li></ul> <i>Console Connection Parameters</i> <br>  The available speeds are 1200, 2400, 4800, 9600, 19200, 38400 and 57600 baud.  The speeds above are not supported by the current implementation of the software / hardware platform.  According to the application developer, at a speed of 115200 baud a large number of errors are fixed, which results in a strong distortion of the transmitted and received information. <br>  The remaining parameters are standard for any terminal program. <br><br>  <i>Terminal settings</i> <br>  The maximum number of lines that a program can memorize when displaying information is 2000. You can select several color schemes and change the font size. <br>  In the same section lists of frequently used commands and passwords are configured.  An extremely convenient feature, especially when using the iPhone / iPod program, where typing on the on-screen keyboard is not very convenient. <br><br>  <i>Session sharing options</i> <br>  This section allows you to configure session sharing options.  There are two options for sharing using special servers located on the Internet and supported by the developer of the Get Console program or using your own server.  The first option is free and is available to all users who purchased the application.  To deploy your own server software purchase is required.  The price varies depending on the number of the number of built-in licenses. <br><br>  How does sharing work?  First, for this feature to work, the device must have access to the Internet.  In the program settings you need to specify through which server this function will work (general or own).  Then, after establishing a session with the device via the console, Telnet or SSH, the ‚ÄúShare session‚Äù button becomes available in the session management menu.  When you click a button, the program establishes an HTTP or HTTPS connection to the server (the connection method is selected in the parameters) and provides a unique PIN for access to this session.  The server through which the program has established a connection has a web interface.  Using a browser, the shared user logs on to the server, enters the session PIN code issued by the program, and in the browser window gains access to the device console.  For general access to the session, registration on the server is not required; all you need is the session PIN.  With shared access, users can execute commands in the console, information provided by the device is duplicated both in the browser and in the Get Console program, i.e.  users see the same picture. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/6003eacc/c7251f2f/679e6c10/1e9c3cc5.png"><br><br>  Dialog box with PIN code after establishing a connection with the server: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/dc477f70/ec378935/037e8044/397f1b40.png"><br><br>  View of the ‚ÄúProgram Settings‚Äù menu on iPad: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/95b7fd72/a13beaaa/8ba55d80/ffea1f63.png"><br><br>  <u>Session Management Menu</u> <br>  The menu allows you to set up a new session via the console or using Telnet / SSH protocols, end the current session, and provide general access to the current session. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/f875f317/33481bad/6a13583b/e85af699.png"><br><br>  <u>Hide / Show Keyboard</u> <br>  Ability to hide / show virtual keyboard.  A useful feature when viewing long listings displayed by the device. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/a9dd6ec4/d181b59f/bd75bb5a/5996c9cd.png"><br><br>  <u>Hide / Show Virtual Key Bar</u> <br>  The panel contains the keys TAB, CTRL, BRAKE,?, ‚Üë, ‚Üì,  necessary for convenient work with the command system of many network devices, for example: <ul><li>  TAB - autocompletion of the command </li><li>  CTRL + ... - perform various operations caused by a key combination with CTRL, for example, switching between different control modes, switching to the beginning or end of a line </li><li>  ?  - display a list of available commands </li><li>  ‚Üë, ‚Üì - transition between the last executed commands </li></ul>  <u>List of frequently used commands</u> <br>  The name speaks for itself.  The list includes the most frequently used commands, for example, for Cisco devices, these can be, sh run, sh ver, conf t, sh ip route. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/c74bf9db/a8bd64b9/7ab4d65c/16a83760.png"><br><br>  <u>Sending CTRL + SHIFT + 6</u> <br>  This feature is specifically designed to work with Cisco equipment.  This key combination allows you to interrupt the current operation being performed. <br><br>  <u>File manager</u> <br>  The file manager is designed to load into the iPad / iPhone / iPod ready configuration scripts, which can then be used during device setup.  To upload files, you need to log in to the Get Console website, upload the necessary files to the server and then, using the file manager, download the files to the device. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/c7b72507/e538698b/ad22da25/c6544bb7.png"><br><br>  <u>Password Manager</u> <br>  Function similar to the list of frequently used commands.  It is a pre-configured list of words.  Text is stored in clear text. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/2c02bc8b/163b3cc8/2acb5c44/42cab9be.png"><br><br>  <u>File storage with console output logs</u> <br>  If the logging option is enabled, then logs of completed sessions are saved in this section.  Files can be uploaded to the Get Console site for further analysis.  For local viewing, you can use the viewer built into the Get Console program, or any other text editor. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/39f87404/faf94a28/4c9ef76e/bb0ef71b.png"><br><br>  <u>Clipboard manager</u> <br>  The manager allows you to edit the text and paste into the console text from the clipboard or editor.  With the help of the editor you can also view the logs of previous sessions. <br>  The manager can be used to quickly adjust the configuration file and then apply it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/ac6608fb/c3bc431f/36d8c7bf/e2251e82.png"><br><br>  View of the program interface on the iPhone: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/7986937c/6ed153fd/d3eaf6c0/1ead1c72.png"><br><br><h4>  Testing console access to network devices </h4><br>  The following equipment was used to test the console access in our <a href="http://testlog.ru/">laboratory</a> : <br><table><tbody><tr><td>  <b>Manufacturer and Model</b> </td><td>  <b>Console port type</b> </td></tr><tr><td>  Cisco 1841 and 2811 routers </td><td>  Rj-45 </td></tr><tr><td>  Cisco 2950 and 2960 Switches </td><td>  Rj-45 </td></tr><tr><td>  Zyxel P-791Rv2 modem </td><td>  Rj-45 </td></tr></tbody></table>  To check the iPhone / iPad, the cable was connected to the console port of the device and after entering the control system (command line, menu) various commands were executed.  Connecting to Cisco equipment did not cause any problems, the command line is available immediately after connecting.  This is not surprising, since  cable designed specifically for this equipment.  To connect to the P-791Rv2 modem, additional adapters were required, since the console port on the ZyXEL Device has a pin assignment that is different from Cisco.  To eliminate this problem, an RJ-45 &lt;-&gt; RJ-45 adapter was manufactured.  Such an adapter can be made for any equipment, for example, for devices with a console port in the form of a DB-9 connector, parts for such adapters can be purchased at any radio market or in an electronic component store.  Below are photos of the connection using the iPad: <br><br>  Cisco 1841 router, Cisco 2950 switch <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/d6f78bf6/62723aee/7d88109f/aee95587.jpg"><br><br>  Zyxel P-791Rv2 modem <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/bcb94116/1369ed1b/9b20156d/5cbaf7cd.jpg"><br><br>  During testing, the connection parameters available in the program were checked: speed, number of data bits, parity, number of stop bits.  Also, as an experiment, it was tested to the extent possible to increase the length of the console cable.  With the help of the cable bay, the length was increased to 30 meters.  With such a length, console access successfully worked at all speeds.  The rest of the tests were also successful. <br><br><h4>  Session Sharing Feature Summary </h4><br>  The video shows the features of the sharing feature.  On the first video of the opportunity for unregistered users, the second for registered. <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/8pquzX4HGVw%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,1500008,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhhMNozcTTTGc_HH9vCfLAhG1BlWow" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/rbRobxYIO0A%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,1500008,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhjxh1-JLqfuMfUQDLZDKPOh0mivRw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h4>  findings </h4><br>  Hardly an iPad / iPhone / iPod Touch with a console cable can replace a network engineer with a full-fledged laptop, but in certain situations having a cable with you can make life much easier. <br><br>  Applications for console cable can be: <br><ul><li>  Initial configuration of the device, until the IP parameters are set on the device. </li><li>  Restoration of the device after an accident, for example, a software malfunction or in case of loss of IP communication with the device. </li><li>  Operational consultation with other engineers.
