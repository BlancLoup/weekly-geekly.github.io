  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Practical cross-platform</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  After six months of using Ubuntu Linux, I finally decided that this is exactly the system I need for work and entertainment.  I organized mail in Evolution and was pleasantly surprised that everything I needed was there, but nothing superfluous (which is especially surprising after working in Microsoft Office Outlook)! <br><br>  It so happened that I bought myself a PocketPC based on WM6 (Windows Mobile 6). <br><br>  Everything was great until the moment when I had many tasks and tasks: I needed complete synchronization between the three products: <br><ul><li>  Evolution </li><li>  Windows Mobile Outlook </li><li>  MS Office Outlook </li></ul><br><a name="habracut"></a><h2>  Search for a solution </h2><br>  After some searching on the Internet, I discovered that I couldn‚Äôt synchronize the Evolution with the PDA through the USB cable (WM6 is not yet supported, and the project for synchronization with WM5 has died completely). 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      Further, I discovered that in theory it is possible to synchronize all three systems through the Exchange server (and this is the right approach).  But I did not find a free Exchange server on the network (I found one, but Evolution refused to work with it because the @ sign was used in the login).  But maybe I did not try to look for it - I like to reinvent the wheel and gain experience, having fun in learning new things. <br><br><h2>  Task </h2><br>  The task, in general, was clear.  It was necessary to write a program that would provide synchronization. <br><br>  BUT! <br><br>  I had absolutely no desire to write three different programs for all three systems.  It was necessary to organize the work in such a way as to minimize the labor intensity. <br><br>  After a certain review, I discovered: <br><br>  1. MS Office Outlook provides an object model for .NET applications. <br>  2. Evolution provides an object model for mono applications. <br>  <font color="gray"><em>For those who do not know: mono is a cross-platform (Win / * nix / Mac) implementation of the .NET Framework.</em></font> <br>  3. WM Outlook provides an object model for .NET applications. <br><br>  Great!  So, I can write everything on C #! <br><br><h2>  Decision </h2><br>  The most important thing is to design everything well!  I built some abstract model: <br><br>  <b>The synchronization provider</b> is an abstract class.  Must be run for all three data sources. <br>  <b>Synchronizer</b> is a system for finding data differences that interacts with synchronization providers.  Uniform for all three programs. <br>  <b>Network Manager</b> - a system for exchanging data between applications over the network (directly or through a server - it does not matter). <br>  <b>Configurator</b> is a system for working with configuration. <br>  <b>Features of the system</b> - a subsystem that stores data about the features of work on different platforms. <br><br>  I distributed these areas of responsibility as follows: <br><br>  Program: <b>Sync Provider Implementation</b> <br>  Library (Sync.dll): <b>Synchronizer</b> , <b>Network Manager</b> , <b>Configurator</b> <br>  Library (Platform.dll): <b>System Features</b> <br><br>  It turns out that I am writing the Sync.dll library, which is the same for everyone, I implement the synchronization providers in all three programs and I write Platform.dll, which will inform the features of the system in which it is executed (the paths to the necessary folders, etc.). <br><br><h2>  For the work! </h2><br>  I started Visual Studio and in one breath implemented Sync.dll.  After that, I started WM Outlook and (after a certain sex when setting up debugging on a virtual device) I wrote the first synchronization provider. <br><br>  Tax ... now Evolution.  I launched MonoDevelop, set evolution mono bindings (with huge sex, as the package did not have dependencies properly observed).  And wrote the second synchronization provider! <br><br>  Launched, and lo and behold!  Contacts from Evolution copied to the PDA!  Now we need to finish the transfer too and fix the little things!  :-) <br><br><h2>  Results </h2><br>  I was surprised that .NET is now truly cross-platform (and, so to speak, cross-device)!  I realized that I can write the same code for three different platforms, one of which is a PDA in general.  And here there is already a lot of room for fantasy!  :-) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/27020/">https://habr.com/ru/post/27020/</a></p>
