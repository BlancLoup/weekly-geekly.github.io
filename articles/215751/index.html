The solutions make it possible to ensure compliance of the level of information storage with modern business needs, increasing the utilization rate of system resources by up to 90%, as well as increasing the possibilities for their consolidation and speeding up the return on investment. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  New family </h4>

      The third-generation ETERNUS DX system line includes four devices: scalable entry-level models ETERNUS DX100 S3 and DX200 S3, as well as middle-class models ETERNUS DX500 S3 and DX600 S3.  All devices of the model range are unified systems with a single package of control software ETERNUS SF.  This allows you to implement the concept of a single family, thereby reducing operating costs and system migration costs. <br>  Such an approach makes it possible to guarantee high security of investments.  So, when using an entry-level scalability and performance system as a consolidated storage becomes insufficient, you can implement a higher-level array on the same disks without data migration, simply by replacing the controller. <br><br>  It is also worth noting that the developers have made every effort to ensure that new systems become fully unified storage.  Data access in devices is provided both via the block protocol via Fiber-Channel, FCoE, iSCSI, SAS and Infiniband, as well as via NFS.  No need to install additional gateways, as some manufacturers do.  In case of further implementation of various replication systems or increasing reliability, the existing licenses for block access will also work for the file mechanism.  In addition, ETERNUS DX have the ability to connect to SAN and NAS. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/aad/adb/7ca/aadadb7ca1ce85f4b608856c566fe936.jpg"><br><br><h4>  What's new? </h4><br><br>  An important aspect in the new line of storage systems Fujitsu ETERNUS DX is to use for connecting disk shelves interface SAS3.  SAS3 is twice as productive as its previous version, which ultimately significantly improves the overall system performance by repeatedly increasing the speed of accessing disks. <br><br>  Also worth noting is the use in the new models of disk shelves of higher density, accommodating up to 60 hard drives.  Such shelves and the transition to a faster connection interface made it possible to remove restrictions on the number of connected SSD drives.  At the same time were left disk shelves 2.5 and 3.5 inches.  All this makes it possible to connect SAS, NL-SAS and SSD disks in any sequence. <br><br>  A number of major improvements have been made in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe cache memory of new storage systems.  So, as an additional cache, an additional solid-state drive with a volume of more than 5.5 TB is used.  When working with large amounts of data, this approach allows you to "close" about 80% of the information at the expense of only one cache.  In fact, this amount of cache allows you to completely put into it, for example, a database. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b4d/106/ab7/b4d106ab78ee9adbb13d0d76d26d76b3.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Little about the OS </h4><br><br>  Another highlight of the Fujitsu ETERNUS DX S3 family of storage systems is the use of the VxWorks operating system that runs inside disk arrays.  It is a hard real-time operating system used in devices with increased performance and security requirements.  This is a modern multi-threaded 64-bit architecture, which, together with the new multi-core Intel server processors, allows for high system performance. <br><br>  The VxWorks operating system has several key advantages: <br>  ‚Ä¢ resource intensity; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Support for multiprocessing and multi-core processors; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Extended support for TCP / IP networks (IPv4, IPv6); <br>  ‚Ä¢ Integration with Windows-based SCADA applications and industrial networks; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Web services support (XML, SOAP, WSDL); <br>  ‚Ä¢ Energy management functions; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Database support. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0b7/18a/527/0b718a5274cdc0e6782948b0cffdec6a.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Optimization </h4><br><br>  Using new Fujitsu ETERNUS DX storage systems with new Intel processors optimized for multiprocessing and multi-threaded processing, controllers with large amounts of cache memory and additional flash-based caches, as well as SAS3 interfaces for connecting hard drives and Fiber Channel network connections with speed 16 Gb / s allowed to provide a fivefold increase in the performance of devices compared to models of the previous series.  It is worth noting the possibility of intelligent data management by priorities - the systems themselves can determine the sequence of creating backup copies. <br><br>  In addition to increasing the number of I / O operations by 5 times, there is also a threefold increase in bandwidth and twice the bus bandwidth.  Also virtualization density increased fivefold.  In particular, now the task of creating snapshots can simply be transferred to a disk system. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Contact info</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  For questions please contact: fujitsu@muk.ua. </div></div><br><br><hr>  <a href="http://training.muk.ua/courses/fujitsu/">Fujitsu Authorized Training Courses</a> <br><br><hr><br>  <a href="http://www.service.muk.ua/">MUK-Service - all types of IT repair: warranty, non-warranty repair, sale of spare parts, contract service</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/215751/">https://habr.com/ru/post/215751/</a></p>
