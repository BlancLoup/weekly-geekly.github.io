After playing a few different games (ARK, Conan Exiles, and others less familiar to the ear), I realized that this was not quite what I would like. <br><br>  Like many guys, in my childhood (past in a big and strong country of 4 letters) I read books on pirate topics: Odyssey of Captain Blood, Treasure Island, and even Gulliver, to some extent, influenced my outlook and attitude to the topic. distant wanderings and dangerous sea adventures. <br><br>  And about six months ago, the stars came together.  I decided to combine my passion for pirate themes and computer games from the genre of "survivors".  <b>I began to make my game in this setting, with preference and courtesans.</b>

But <b>now, for about seven months, I have been developing my first game, in which I want to show my own view on how a good survival should look like</b> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ab8/9b3/265/ab89b3265f1885a5aeb908c0bdf7e808.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In my opinion, ‚Äúeverything is simple‚Äù: it should be interesting, eventful, logical and realistic.  It is these criteria that I consider essential and I try to keep my imagination within the designated framework.  In my game, there is no accelerated pumping from the Stone Age to almost space technologies (as in ARK Survival Evolved, there are no dinosaurs under the saddle either), there are no cults and gods (as in Conan Exiles), no teleportation (as in RUST), but it has a unique pirate flavor (as in Black Flag) and a realistic (including visually) hostile world around us, whose main goal is to kill a player. <br><br><h3>  What is and will be in my game? </h3><br>  <b>In the single player, which is scheduled for release at the end of the summer (today readiness is estimated at about 2/3):</b> <br><br>  - The island lost in the ocean (formally there are 3 of them, but 2 of them are quite small) with a waterfall and a watering hole inhabited by various living creatures (including large animals whose appearance on the island is no contradiction, and the shipwreck will put everything in its place ), there are separate sub-locations and scripted events on the island: quicksand, sandstorm, rockfalls and mountain falls, tides (weather conditions), two fishing villages, where each hut hides its secrets, dangers and valuable loot, caves the cat  Orye can be investigated. <br><br>  - Inventory of the character with the Kraft system and the basic construction system (similar to that in PlanetSide 2: resources are collected according to the recipe, the object is crafted, positioned and placed on the stage), storages (boxes, barrels, baskets, which may contain valuable contents). <br><br>  - Character's parameters include: hunger, thirst, heat and cold, experience for actions, stamina, health, some of them are indicated by indicators that are not familiar to the games, but for example by steam from the mouth (on a cold night) or by haze on the horizon (in the afternoon heat). <br><br>  - The basic swimming system of the character (finished just yesterday), now you can move between the islands (if you are not afraid of aquatic predators), but if you forget about stamina - you can also drown. <br><br>  - The islands are populated with various animals, for different types of which there is a different artificial intelligence (for the time being the base, but the chickens are already walking around the villages and carrying eggs, crocodiles are attacking from under the water, the rhino is straining when a small bug flies before his nose, and the hippo protects helpless pups, turning into dangerous opponents in the event of the death of the "dad"), there are birds that add randomness and saturation to the picture. <br><br>  - The change of time of day has been implemented and the preparation of various weather conditions has begun (as mentioned above tides in the morning and evening, there is preparation for storms, squalls and hurricanes with rain and thunderstorms, there is a basic earthquake causing all rockfalls in the mountains). <br><br>  - There is an unfinished fort on the island where you can shoot a cannon (if you're lucky, you can shoot a large living creature on the other end of the bay), and the gun is also made with the maximum available realism: it can be charged with a core, it is aimed vertically or it can be moved aside, the shot is made by setting the wick on fire with a torch. <br><br>  - The shipwreck will slightly open the veil of secrecy over the origin of large animals on the island, and not only. <br><br>  - In the caves, you can get lost (in a large multi-level) or get poisoned (in an abandoned lead mine) with a fatal outcome. <br><br>  - In the near future plans to add the ability to tame wild animals (home cow can now be milked, for example) for use in their own purposes. <br><br>  <b>How the game looks like now can be seen in the fresh video:</b> <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FS4hrlhbTrc" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <b>In the multiplayer, which will be written snnulya, but taking into account the knowledge and contacts acquired during the creation of a single player (with knowledgeable and experienced people) are planned</b> : <br><br>  - Transparent and logical economic system and trade, in which goods do not appear from the air, but must be grown, produced in another way or found / mined. <br><br>  - Ability to buy and seize property of any kind: household trivia, ships, houses, even islands and entire provinces of a large continent. <br><br>  - Ability to try on the skin of any resident of a pirate colony (and not just a banal pirate). <br><br>  - The location will be expanded with new islands and a large continent. Ideally, I would like to make planetary coverage and give players the opportunity to travel around the world for commercial and military purposes. <br><br>  - The list of weather conditions and cataclysms will be expanded. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8db/853/51a/8db85351ae57b7c64cd0d51903957dff.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  When writing this post, my goal is to show as many people as possible that any decision in our life depends only on ourselves, people are not born professionals in some field, they become them through painstaking and long work.  I still can not consider myself a professional in the development of games, but I make such a game that I would be interested in playing myself, but as the experience of Counter-Strike and Dota shows, the games created by players for players have a very high potential.  And I hope I can make a good game for which I will not be ashamed in front of the players and myself. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/332960/">https://habr.com/ru/post/332960/</a></p>
