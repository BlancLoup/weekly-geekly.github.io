Service promotion communities Vkontakte - SmmReact</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Good day.  My name is Andrey Vlasenko, I am 25 years old.  A month ago, together with my friend Vasily Mezko and I, we launched a service to promote communities on the social network Vkontakte <a href="http://post.smmreact.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dmegamozg%26utm_medium%3Dblog%26utm_campaign%3Dpost_1_1.02.2016">SmmReact</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/e45/7e7/651/e457e765174125997ebfbc00a5914358.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In IT startups were random.  The first project was the <a href="http://bx.getproff.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dmegamozg%26utm_medium%3Dblog%26utm_campaign%3Dpost_1_1.02.2016">bx.getproff.r</a> u application for synchronizing CRM Bitrix24 contacts with the phonebook in Android and IOS smartphones.  It seemed to us that it is terribly useful and necessary product.  Due to the nature of our offline activities, we really needed such a service, but since we did not find ready-made solutions, we had to create it.

      SmmReact - became the second project in our piggy bank.  The idea reappeared from the problem.  In order to diversify the content of our blog about industrial mountaineering <a href="http://vk.com/alpateks">vk.com/alpateks</a> (this is our offline activity) we decided to invent a new format for Vkontakte drawings. <br><br>  Namely, to make such drawings of Vkontakte, where everybody who fulfills the obligatory conditions wins: repost, subscription or repost + subscription.  The idea is that within any target audience you can come up with valuable and conditionally free content that can be ‚Äúdistributed‚Äù only to active subscribers who share your news. <br><br>  <b>How it works.</b> <br><br>  The user of the service creates a post in his community, in which he promises everyone who makes a repost or subscribes to the community to give some valuable content (training course, article, film, program, document, etc.) <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Next, it registers the post in the system, downloads links to useful materials and starts the rally.  The service generates a unique link by which the content will be available.  The user inserts it into the text of the post and starts the rally. <br><br>  Now, everyone who follows the link and fulfills the required conditions will be able to download the promised files.  If, however, the subscriber does not fulfill one of the conditions, he will be able to see only the list of materials and the notification that he has not fulfilled the mandatory conditions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/529/d6a/344/529d6a34404be40119c9a2efbf70abb8.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Thus, we automate the process of distributing useful content and encourage people to join your community and share its news. <br><br>  <b>Ideas for use.</b> <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ A representative of infobusiness can please its subscribers with a record of a useful webinar or a training course.  Or you can share a list of useful services or send a link to the upcoming webinar. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Suppliers of goods or services may post a feature article on a topic relevant to subscribers, or they may distribute certificates or promotional codes for bonus goods or services. <br><br>  Sushi delivery, for example, can give a certificate for a free roll, and a fitness trainer can hand out nutrition or training programs.  Paintball club, can give bonus balls or rent additional equipment, and coffee shops, please their customers with a certificate for donuts or a bonus cup of coffee. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Professionals and experts in any field can give their subscribers a certificate for any amount that can pay part of the cost of their services or share a review of a useful service or program.  Or they can, distribute certificates for a free consultation or send records of already conducted paid consultations. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Bloggers can distribute books, articles or films that have somehow or other influenced their lives.  And they can share checklists, manuals, instructions on how to achieve certain tasks or tell about their success stories. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/0ac/790/d67/0ac790d673e5149a8fd2eb45e5991e47.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  And this is only part of the ideas for using the service.  The most important thing is that the more useful and better the content that the user gives to his subscribers, the greater will be the return on the use of the service. <br><br>  <b>Cost and promotion model.</b> <br><br>  To speed up the process of promoting the service to the market, first of all, after the implementation of the main functionality, we launched an affiliate program with 40% deductions from referral user fees.  Having seen the success of this approach among colleagues in cloud services, we decided that sharing profits with partners is more profitable than investing a budget in advertising. <br><br>  Model of monetization chosen - "Payment for the post."  That is, the user is exempt from the subscription fee and pays only the cost of the posted post in the amount of 99 rubles.  Also, they implemented bonus accruals, depending on the amount of replenishment.  Thus, the user can start the rally in less than 50 rubles. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/0ac/790/d67/0ac790d673e5149a8fd2eb45e5991e47.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Future plans.</b> <br><br>  Now that we have already seen the interest in the service from different business areas, we understand that the service is needed and it needs to be developed.  At the moment, we have a list of more than 20 innovations that we plan to implement, but the most valuable for us is feedback from users.  From them, ideas of functions which really need to be realized proceed. <br><br>  All feedback we collect in our group Vkontakte: <a href="http://vk.com/smmreact">vk.com/smmreact</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/298336/">https://habr.com/ru/post/298336/</a></p>
