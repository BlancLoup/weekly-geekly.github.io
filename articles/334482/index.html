Who draws them?  How are they created?  How to become a game artist / designer?  Listeners will find out the answers to these and many other questions during the lecture. <br><br>  We are on the threshold of a new era, and this is the era of computer games and simulations.  For a long time, psychologists have found that the human brain does not distinguish reality from fiction or memory, it experiences a certain life experience, and this experience is important for us, whatever the source. <br><br>  One day, the best of those worlds that artists now create for games will take their place in the history of world art, fall into the galleries and exhibition spaces of the future and become the subject of controversy by art historians and cultural scientists.  But today we still do not notice how amazing and magnificent worlds are created by the artists of our time for the gaming industry. <br><br>  In this lecture, students will get acquainted with the best game artists of our days.  In addition, the lecturer will talk about what artists are doing and why, what prospects they have and how they can be realized in the gaming field. <br><br>  <b>Lecturer</b> - <a href="https://vk.com/velivera/">Vera Velichko</a> , teacher of educational programs in the gaming industry at the Higher School of Economics Higher School of Education at the Higher School of Economics, founder of Owl Studio, has been drawing for over 22 years, eight of them are in game devs.  She led the development of art for a variety of projects of various stylistics and genres. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/7b1/19e/975/7b119e9758194df6bc5fbc71633034c0.jpg"><br>  <b>Beginning at 19:00.</b> <br><br>  All are welcome. <br><br>  ‚Üí Link to <a href="https://hselectorium.timepad.ru/event/517590/"><b><u>electronic registration</u></b></a> <br><br>  <b>Address</b> : Art.  m.

You made an excellent computer (or mobile) game!  But what's the point if no one knows about it?  In today's world, where thousands of games come out every day, it is marketing that determines whether you will succeed.  Will your game be heard or die in obscurity?  Will you be able to get the support of the stores and the attention of the press or the limit of your audience - friends and work colleagues?  It is exactly the marketing of games that is more relevant than ever, because the offer, as a rule, far exceeds demand. <br><br>  It is about how <b>games marketing</b> is being built now, what novice developers need to do, how to promote their project (especially if the marketing budget is not particularly large), and the lectures will be discussed. <br><br>  How to determine the target audience of your game?  What are ‚Äútraffic purchases‚Äù and why press releases no longer help attracting proper gaming press attention?  Is it worth it to show your project at game shows and what are they like?  All this will be learned during the lecture. <br><br>  <b>Lecturer</b> - <a href="http://hsbi.hse.ru/person/teachers/zykov-sergey/">Sergey Zykov</a> , a teacher of educational programs in the gaming industry at the Higher School of Economics Higher School of Economics National Research University Higher School of Economics, a professional and expert with more than 12 years of experience in the gaming industry. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/ab9/2a5/02d/ab92a502dea04dab9622a4b1eb3ebde5.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Beginning at 19:00.</b> <br>  All are welcome. <br><br>  ‚Üí Link to <a href="https://hselectorium.timepad.ru/event/517597/"><b><u>electronic registration</u></b></a> <br><br>  <b>Address</b> : Art.  m.

But the basis of any rules are regularly repeated activities that determine the very mechanics of the game.  These atomic elements make us return again and again to the game, to get involved in and get involved in the game processes, to receive the injection of the neurotransmitter dopamine in the process of learning and gaining mastery. <br><br>  <b>In the open lecture we will talk:</b> <br><br>  - About what is Game Mechanics, and why is it the basis of the game? <br>  - We will discuss the basic principles of the game mechanics. <br>  - We will give a general classification of Game Mechanics and analyze the history of their development using real examples. <br><br>  <b>The lecture will be interesting:</b> <br><br>  - Novice game developers who want to understand the basics of the functioning of games. <br>  - People interested in games and considering the opportunity to start working in the gaming industry. <br>  - Employees of gaming companies for greater understanding and reinforcement of knowledge about game mechanics. <br><br>  The open lecture will be conducted by the teacher of the discipline ‚ÄúGame mechanics‚Äù on the program ‚ÄúManagement of game projects‚Äù - <a href="http://hsbi.hse.ru/person/teachers/gimelreykh-sergey/">Sergey Gimelreich</a> .
