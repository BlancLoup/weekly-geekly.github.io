Even the old Pushkin, carrying out a search for fish, constantly received irrelevant extradition. <br><br>  Modern technologies have reached a more advanced level - the net is no longer relevant, we will use search engines.  Yandex, Rambler, Google - these are the top three in popularity among search engines.  In fact, there are thousands of them, these silent, but talking about a lot, helpers: Aport, MsDewey, Quintura, Alexa Internet, Topix, Dictionary.com, etc.

      All search engines have the same principles, but different search methods, so the results for the same request will differ, in addition, the bases of the indexed sites are also different for all search engines, although they can sometimes use competitor databases if such an agreement exists.  For example, mail.ru uses Yandex base. <br><br>  The task of the SEO (Search Engines Optimization) specialist, otherwise the optimizer, is to know or guess, assume, predict all the movements of the search engine ‚Äúsoul‚Äù.  It is necessary to make such a site, which the search engine will think as perfect.  And in the issue on request will put it in the first positions.  Why is this necessary?  - another question, if you know what <a href="http://www.seomen.ru/promotion.php">site promotion is</a> , why you need it, you should also know. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  Let us follow the course of the search engine thought (of course, this is just our guesswork).  The search engine was asked a question: "site promotion in Novosibirsk."  He looks at those sites that are indexed, that is, is present in his database, those sites about the existence of which he knows.  Of these chooses, in which in the text, the title (title tag) occurs such a combination.  Chose the search result: pages - 41,098, sites - at least 2,111. It is necessary to organize them according to some principle.  It is desirable that this satisfy the user. <br><br>  What would you do on the site search engine?  It is logical to view all the documents and select only those that suit you.  Surely, you are looking for a company from Novosibirsk, which could qualitatively help you with the promotion of your site, preferably at reasonable prices and excellent results.  But the search engine - the car, what question was asked, and answers that one. <br><br>  To as closely as possible bring the result of the issue to the expectations of the search, the creators of search engines have come up with several tricks. <br>  Link popularity - the total amount of external links that mention your page.  The search engine thinks that the more sites on the network link to the document or domain on which it is located, the more important and authoritative the document. <br><br>  There are several types of quantitative expression of link popularity - PageRank (Google), VIC and TCI (Yandex), IC (Aport). <br><br>  Citation Index (IC) - the number of sites that link to this site.  Links from sites located on free hosting, links from guest books, forums, and a number of directories are excluded from the total number of domains.  Updated weekly. <br><br>  Weighted citation index (VIC) of Yandex, taking into account the number of pages that link to the site, and the own VIC of these pages.  Calculated for each page in the database of Yandex.  Updated twice a week.  It is one of the factors affecting the position of the page in Yandex search results. <br><br>  Thematic Vic (CY) is a weighted Yandex citation index, calculated taking into account the correspondence between the themes of your site and the sites that link to your site.  The algorithm is not disclosed. <br>  PageRank (PR) is a measure of the ‚Äúimportance‚Äù of a page, according to Google search engine data.  PR depends on the number of external links to this page and on their quality (in turn, the number of external links to referring pages). <br>  Recently, due to the general automated link exchange, the effect of various types of Citation Indexes on search engine results is very small. <br><br>  Therefore, optimizers also try to use some tricks to promote sites. <br><br>  In parting words, contact the professionals, too often we think that we know and are able to do everything, but experts still know more, and even more so seo professionals working in such tough competitive conditions. <br><br><br>  All the best to your site <br>  <a href="http://www.seomen.ru/design.php">Seomen Design Studio</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/6399/">https://habr.com/ru/post/6399/</a></p>
