The set is a lot, conceivable as a whole.  The whole is understood as the set that we consider as one object of accounting.  This accounting object has a different meaning than an individual object.  We can perceive objects individually - one way of organizing our perception, and we can perceive groups of objects - another way.  The first method allows us to carry out operations on groups: add them, subtract, find common parts.

      An attribute of a set is, for example, the number of its elements. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Synthesis process</b> <br><br>  In philosophy, there is the concept of synthesis.  This designation changes the perspective of our perception.  We can perceive a multitude of objects, and then, on the basis of this multitude, make a synthesis of these objects and generate an object of larger scale.  In other words, make a composition. <br><br>  <b>Difference set from the synthesis process</b> <br><br>  Let's ask the mathematician to give an example of a set and its synthesis.  The mathematician may offer to consider the set of points on the segment.  He will think this set as a whole not in the sense that the points on the segment form a segment, but in the sense that the group of points is one.  With this group, he can do a join operation with another group of points lying on a circle and get one big group of points.  It can also carry out a synthesis of points lying on one segment, and get a segment.  The thinking of a group of points as a whole is not a synthesis of this group into an object. <br><br>  The length attribute is, for example, its length. <br><br>  <b>System definition</b> <b><br></b> <br>  Now let's turn to the definition of the system: <br>  A system is a set of elements that are in relationships and relationships with each other, which forms a certain integrity, unity. <br><br>  An attribute of a system is, for example, the number of its elements. <br><br>  <b>Collision Description</b> <br><br>  There is an ambiguity in the definition of the system, which the authors of system engineering did not recognize.  The words "forms a certain integrity" must be understood - conceivable as one, and not a synthesis operation.  That is, a system is a group of objects, not objects of a group, and we can perform the same operations on systems that we perform on sets: addition, subtraction, intersection. <br><br>  Above the system, you can perform a synthesis operation and get an object.  But the object obtained as a result of the synthesis is not a system, because it is no longer a set of objects. <br>  An attribute of a synthesized object can be, for example, the color of an object. <br>  It is clear that the system can not have color. <br><br>  But it seems that in systems engineering they do not distinguish between the concepts of an object and a system.  All thanks to the fact that they do not share the way of perception of a set of objects as a whole and the process of synthesis of an object based on its construction. <br><br>  If system engineers would make the right conclusions, they would recognize that what they call a system has a synonym for - design.  And that system, that construction is the same thing. <br><br>  Fuel to the fire pours our tongue.  There is no way to separate two points of view: a look at the structure and a look at an object have the same name.  I wrote about this earlier in the article <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/328192/">Concept of system and design.</a>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/328192/">Their place in the design of information systems</a> <br><br>  But what I did not expect when I wrote this article is that in system engineering they do not distinguish between a system and an object obtained on the basis of its synthesis. <br><br>  As a result, I see that a whole layer of important knowledge has leaked from system engineering.  About the possibilities that were lost in the end, I described in the article <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/329576/">Structural Modeling.</a>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/329576/">Requirements for the modeler</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/342496/">https://habr.com/ru/post/342496/</a></p>
