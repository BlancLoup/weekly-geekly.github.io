I was very pleased.  It happened that you would call at three o'clock in the morning with some kind of stupid problem - and there the boy cleverly explains, helps with a cheerful voice. <br><br>  When the company began to face the problems of reliability of power supply (for example, <a href="http://www.cnews.ru/news/top/index.shtml%3F2008/01/17/283817">not so long ago</a> ), it was even a little pitiful.  Respect for the quality of service is not at all reduced. <br><br>  But the person is arranged in such a way that if the problems concern him, then immediately everything turns upside down.  So it‚Äôs with me - now I‚Äôll probably join the ranks of Masterhost non-lovers.

      Here are a couple of stories. <a name="habracut"></a><br>  <strong>Story number 1</strong> .  It took me for one minor service like SSL.  The hosting is virtual, the most common, 10-bucks.  Well, I went, as it should be, to the <a href="http://cp.masterhost.ru/">‚ÄúControl Panel‚Äù</a> , I found the necessary ‚ÄúAdd SSL‚Äù button there and got to the page with the form where you can send a request for a real IP, ticked ‚Äúneed SSL‚Äù, explained the reasons (I don‚Äôt know why but there it was written required).  At the same time, as I understand it, a letter was formed to the support service.  Formed on the basis of data from this form.  After a while, the answer came.  It is better to quote: <br><blockquote>  <em>Hello!</em> <em><br><br></em>  <em>&gt; Add a "dedicated IP / SSL" service for the <a href="http://tygde.ru/">abc00000.ru</a> domain on the site u00000 (SSL</em> <em><br></em>  <em>&gt; needed).</em> <em><br></em>  <em>&gt; Comment:</em> <em><br></em>  <em>&gt; It is necessary to organize the work of the browser with the site via HTTPS</em> <em><br><br></em>  <em>You can independently add the service "Dedicated IP / SSL" in the panel</em> <em><br></em>  <em>management.</em>  <em>To do this, you need to go to the "Service Tree" section, select</em> <em><br></em>  <em>the required domain and in the line "Dedicated IP / SSL" click on the link "Add".</em> <em><br><br></em>  <em>Control Panel</em> <em><br><br></em>  <em>* <a href="https://cp.masterhost.ru/">https://cp.masterhost.ru</a></em> <em><br><br></em>  <em><font color="#888888">-</font></em> <em><br></em>  <em><font color="#888888">Respectfully,</font></em> <em><br></em>  <em><font color="#888888">Andrey Zabornikov</font></em> <em><br></em>  <em><font color="#888888">.masterhost</font></em> <em><font color="#888888"><br></font></em> </blockquote>  In other words, I was looped :-) <br><br>  All wrong, do not worry.  The only problem is that the support service Masterhost is now mistaken permanently: - / <br><br>  It was not easy to explain on the phone that I had already sent a request that I had the wrong answer.  By default, the help desk is talking to you like an idiot.  Probably, this is correct - I know perfectly well what a support service is.  That's just to switch from "idiotic" conversation to normal, you can quickly, but you can not.  It is clearly seen that this speed of switching over Master's falls with the years: - / <br><br>  <strong>Story number 2.</strong>  Today, on this post-holiday morning, I had the pleasure of communicating with Tatiana, a support service specialist.  It was something.  About the fact that it was very difficult to find a common language with her, I don‚Äôt want to mention something, so I‚Äôll only outline the essence of the problem.  I have several domains on one site at once.  There once used native Masterkhostovsky mail, then quickly and quickly went over to <a href="http://www.google.com/a/help/intl/en/index.html">Google Apps</a> - as soon as they appeared.  Masterhost interfaces are forgotten like a bad dream.  They really were very scary.  I remember, I was still surprised when they for some reason, for replacing the ugly <a href="http://mail.masterhost.ru/">mail.masterhost.ru,</a> launched an equally ugly ‚Äúnew‚Äù <a href="http://wmail.masterhost.ru/">wmail.masterhost.ru</a> .  You can‚Äôt look at both without tears. <br><br>  So, I had to look today.  But how?  The fact is that I get 1 sms and 1 email every day for a couple of weeks every day, saying that I have reached the 100MB limit on using mail.  OK, today I found the time to figure it out.  I didn‚Äôt find any information in cp.masterhost.ru about which domain email (let me remind you that I have several on the site) rested on the restriction (and the 100MB limit is on the site, that is, the amount by domains).  OK, I thought, for sure this is the most used samokhvalov.com.  Tried to go to the old mail interface.  After logging in, I see only white pages.  I go into a new one - I see errors in big red letters and nothing works. <br><br>  I understand that it is better to call.  Specialist Tatiana, after listening to me, said that the only option to clean normally is to send a request through a web form.  Brr ... After the story number 1, no desire.  OK, I ask, is it possible to somehow dunk all the mail, kill it to hell with the dog?  I explain that I registered the MX records in the DNS settings in order to use Google Mail and that I want to simply dunk masterhost mail.  Tatiana left for 5 minutes ... She came back and explained in detail what I need to do to kill the mail.  OK, ok, ok, I say, and this is what I need and the MX records will work?  Nope  Will not. <br><br>  Well, that asked! <br><br>  Well, damn it, ok - let me clean my drawers.  How can I do it?!  "Send a request through the form ..." No!  I want myself.  So that in the future, do not write or call anywhere.  Only here Tatyana explained that the interfaces do not work due to the fact that he rested on quotas ... In the yard of 2008, the company seems rather big ... Full fly. <br><br>  Got it.  I went to cp.masterhost.ru, clicked ‚Äúgive me another 10MB‚Äù (by the way, for an additional $ 0.40), waited a minute - hurray!  Logged in  Cleaned up.  Freed 10MB ... But where else? .. <br><br>  Obviously, it is necessary to do the same procedure with other domains.  For this, it is necessary for each of them to remember the password on the postmaster, to go to the interface, having previously increased the quota by 10MB, to clean, then lower the quota again so that the extra pennies are not written off every month.  Brrrrrrrr ... <br><br>  In general, I called again, I got to Tatiana again.  Made her find out which of the domains I need to clean.  He tortured a little more on the topic, but are there any ways to figure it out yourself?  It turned out that there is.  Through ssh access.  It is good that he is there alone on the site, and not for each domain. <br><br>  It is clear that I was not surprised at all when I killed the most messy mail account, in front of whose name it stood: ‚ÄúUsed: 74.13 MB, Quota: 10 MB‚Äù ... <br><br>  PS You won‚Äôt believe it, but just now, an hour after the cleaning (and you cleaned out 84 MB !!), you‚Äôll receive an SMS message saying that the mail disk space is running out ... Show must go on. <br><br>  <em>UPDATE: a representative of the company Masterhost <a href="http://samokhvalov.habrahabr.ru/blog/41295.html">gave an exhaustive answer</a> , for which he thanks a lot.</em>  <em>I am very glad that the public coverage of the problems led to a positive result.</em>  <em>With the refusal of Masterkhosta, perhaps, wait a bit :-)</em> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/24672/">https://habr.com/ru/post/24672/</a></p>
