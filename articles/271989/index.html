The conference is organized by the Russian PostgreSQL community with the support of sponsors.  The general partner of PGConf.RU 2016 is Postgres Professional, Avito is the gold partner. <br><br>  This conference is organized in Moscow for the second time.  In <a href="https://pgconf.ru/2015">February 2015, PGConf.RU</a> gathered 460 participants, becoming the world's largest forum dedicated to PostgreSQL. <br><br>  The main topics of the conference:

    <ul><li>  Scalability, performance, security PostgreSQL. </li><li>  PostgreSQL core development.  Internal organization.  Current and future projects. </li><li>  Live experience of practical use of PostgreSQL in Russia and abroad.  Implementation, migration, application development.  Reports from the field. </li><li>  Cluster  Failover and scalable systems based on PostgreSQL </li><li>  PostgreSQL in Russia.  Russian community.  Education.  PostgreSQL in tasks of import substitution and achieving technological independence. </li></ul><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  As always, reports on any topics of interest to the community are welcome.  For today the program committee forms lists of speakers and the reception of reports is open. <br><br>  February 3 will be the day of master classes, which will be held in 3 streams, among the accepted topics: <br><br><ol><li>  Alexander Korotkov, Fedor Sigaev, Anastasia Lubennikova: Programming at the kernel level and PostgreSQL extensions. </li><li>  Dimitri Fontaine.  (subject to be specified) </li><li>  Ivan Frolkov.  Query Optimization in PostgreSQL </li><li>  Ilya Kosmodemyansky.  Setting OS and hardware for PostgreSQL </li><li>  Use of PostgreSQL in 1C (lecturer is specified) </li><li>  Oracle Migration to PostgreSQL (lecturer to be confirmed) </li></ol><br><br>  February 4 and 5 - days of reports (some reports will be in English, we will provide simultaneous translation). <br><br>  A number of confirmed speakers will devote speeches to cluster topics.  This is a hot and popular topic: at the developers meeting, which was held at the Vienna conference PgConf.Europe 2015, it was decided that the cluster should be supported by the post-resident itself, and not just by external systems. <br><br><img align="right" src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a77/043/067/a770430676204eb390f77c3eda366693.jpg" title="Galy lee" width="150">  One of the oldest and most well-known, but also highly controversial cluster solutions is the Postgres XC-XL line, which was presented by Postgres-XL Mason Sharp last Russian PgConf.  Now the development center of this area has moved to China, and the Galy Lee report ‚ÄúThe growing recognition of PostgreSQL in China‚Äù will tell about the current state of this project.  By the way, the company 2nd Quadrant has been porting Postgres-XL to the modern version of PostgreSQL 9.5, Pavan Deolasee will tell about the results. <br><br><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/files/511/00a/d45/51100ad45d174bb289e918febe95872e.jpg" title="Marco slot" width="150">  Citus Data - a company developing a different direction of cluster technologies, known for its products pg_shard, cstore_fdw, CitusDB - will be presented by the Marco Slot report ‚ÄúCitusDB: an extension for Scaling out PostgreSQL‚Äù.  Marco promises to demonstrate a cluster with a large number of nodes. <br><br>  GreenPlum is a distributed database engine developed on the basis of PostgreSQL by Pivotal, recently became OpenSource.  This will tell the lead developer Andreas Scherbaum.  Heikki Linnakangas, who also now works at Pivotal, will present a detailed account of the internal use of indexes of various types. <br><br>  Tatsuo Ishii, the author of PgPool and the leader of the Japanese PostgreSQL community, will talk about building clusters based on streaming replication and PgPool II. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/567/cbd/fd8/567cbdfd850947a6b05d27c20078b4c3.jpg" title="Heikki linnakangas"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/976/49c/dcf/97649cdcf95b41b48d2aa1b6de231c10.jpg" title="Andreas Scherbaum" width="140"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/188/81c/2de/18881c2de91c4a59a3399eee46216243.jpg" title="Tatsuo ishii"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7e8/dd5/ac7/7e8dd5ac7a44421c9e00c44c84ff8825.jpg" title="Peter van Hardenberg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c80/5c8/489/c805c8489136426bb3aeefc5b3b3337e.jpg" title="Alexander Korotkov"><br><br>  Russian cluster developers Konstantin Knizhnik and Alexander Korotkov will share information about the Distributed Transaction Manager (DTM) they are developing, which is necessary to ensure the consistency of data within the cluster and is suitable for use within various cluster solutions. <br><br>  Two speakers from Heroku will talk about using PostgreSQL in the cloud: Peter van Hardenberg (‚ÄúManaging a million databases‚Äù) and Will Leinweber (‚ÄúHeroku Postgres: architecture of a cloud database service‚Äù), and Guangzhou Zhang from Alibaba. <br><br>  As you know, the 1C platform runs on several DBMSs, and PostgreSQL is one of them.  Now in Russia, the popularity of Postgres as a DBMS for 1C products is growing, and several reports will be devoted to practical experience related to this.  In particular, Dmitry Yukhtimovsky from Gilev.Ru will talk about the experience of using large 1C databases on PostgreSQL. <br><br>  The conference will include a round table on the subject of import substitution and Russian software, to which representatives of the Ministry of Communications and Mass Media, software development companies and public organizations are invited. <br><br>  Several presentations will be devoted to the life of the PostgreSQL community: Magnus Hagander, president of PostgreSQL Europe, will talk about the structure and evolution of the community, Andrew Dunstan will answer the many questions ‚ÄúHow to contribute a feature‚Äù.  The rising star of the Russian development, Anastasia Lubennikova, will complement it in her report ‚ÄúHow to become a Postgres developer‚Äù. <br><br>  Famous Russian developers Oleg Bartunov and Fyodor Sigaev will also speak at the conference and hold a question-and-answer session. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/569/75f/9ed/56975f9ede0c40dba2acb7f34750dd3d.jpg" title="Oleg Bartunov"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a62/cf5/672/a62cf5672571401abd0724fec50fdd86.jpg" title="Fedor Sigaev"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/115/026/911/1150269112484578a1307e779619b714.jpg" title="Magnus hagander"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a5c/d86/aab/a5cd86aab1e34d0daceaedf4d62023ff.jpg" title="Bruce momjian"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d48/917/bb0/d48917bb0762469e9bf864b0e7f00514.jpg" alt="Anastasia Lubennikova"><br><br>  For the first time, a guest from the Republic of Korea - Hyungjoo Lee from Bitnine will take part in the Russian postgrese events.  There, too, there is PostgreSQL and a local database spill derived from it.  Why did they need it, how is business being built on a DBMS in Korea, and how is the community being built - we learn from the report. <br><br>  This is only part of the reports available to the program committee.  The program is still being formed, and we continue to accept applications for reports.  This year we offer the speakers two report formats - full (45 minutes) and short (22 minutes), and we plan to hold a session of blitz reports (Lightning talks), which will be recorded at the conference itself. <br><br>  Registration of participants and speakers is open on the conference website <a href="https://pgconf.ru/">pgconf.ru</a> . <br>  For non-resident participants a bonus - if paid before January 15, the ticket includes accommodation at the Izmailovo Hotel (booked by the organizing committee, number of seats is limited).  Confirmed speakers buy tickets and also placed in the hotel. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/271989/">https://habr.com/ru/post/271989/</a></p>
