  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Environmentalists on taxes on air and water</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Ecological movements in defense of nature, animals and the habitat always lack funds.  Funds are needed for the development and strengthening of the governing apparatus and the remuneration of those who already see in this idea of ‚Äã‚Äãfighting for the habitat a tasty morsel of the ecological niche where services for meeting the needs of man and society in a clean environment are located. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Ecology is one of the promising areas for serving the needs of society, in which money has not yet been learned to withdraw for centralized development.  If with the material needs in the process of commodity exchange, everything fell into place for a long time, then here the monetary relations still almost did not smell.  Yes, they learned how to withdraw money from the owners of the land, because the land provided primary material benefits.  But the basic position of states in the right to resources has always included the ownership of water and forests and, obviously, the airspace above this grace.  There is only one step left - to start raising a respectful attitude towards the use of water-air state property among the whole society with sufficient incomes, like, for example, they are now trying to establish a position with intellectual property. <br><br>  After all, there is no difference: both are basic needs of a person and society.  A person needs high-quality information and he is ready to pay for it - a person needs high-quality air, and why can‚Äôt we incline him to think that he will pay for it?  Information, as practice shows, is just as difficult to keep from spreading as air, therefore, we must admit, we cannot deprive a person of the ability to breathe (compare: use information), but we can begin to educate society so that its individual members feel guilty , if you do not pay for the use of the benefit of breathing. <br><br>  The fact that the share of the author‚Äôs income among the total incomes of information traders (and pleasures based on information, this is the same thing) did not exceed 1% did not bother anyone especially, because all the workers in the sphere knew where the main money should go and who - on them, the workers themselves.  Thanks to a successful confluence of technologies, in the field of intellectual property there was something to pay for - supposedly for the production of carriers, the organization of concerts or the organization of labor of scientists.  Among them, these revenues, super-profit was born, explained by the uniqueness of property and royalties, which was partly true.  Yes, they needed this truth in order to gain a foothold in revenues and take lobbying positions in the mentality of all countries.  What do environmentalists do?  Now they need to, openly and without shame, declare their right to a portion of the income from the air used and clean water.  After all, they will manage this part of the state property prescribed in the Constitution, therefore, they have the right to receive income from taxes on core resources.

      We propose to start small, with a few rubles a year for each breathing person, but so that the society strengthens the consciousness of responsibility for the need for such deductions.  It will take a little time, and we, environmentalists, will have a steady income, albeit not like the jugglers with intellectual property.  But we are still ahead. <br><br>  Related Links: <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/linker/go/99334/">Mikhalkov will deduct a percentage from the "Vidic", ending with travel</a> . <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/copyright/97877/">How really to deal with the domination of copyright and publisher's yoke</a> . <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/linker/go/97564/">The American Authors Society is trying to ban free content</a> . <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/copyright/">Other ...</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/99341/">https://habr.com/ru/post/99341/</a></p>
