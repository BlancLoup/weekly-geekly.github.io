  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Extremely Dangerous Matrix - Wanted: The matrix</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <strong>Introduction.</strong> <br>  Let's remember the whole multiplication table: <br>  2 times 2 will be four <br>  3 times 3 will be nine <br>  These are constants.  They are infinite.  Knowing the constants, we can solve the most complicated problems in mathematics.  Knowing the constants in the movie producers can make money forgetting about art. <br>  <strong>Part one.</strong> <br>  There is a certain algorithm for making commercially successful films.  For example, the original American or Brazilian series is taken, the script is rewritten under the mentality of the country in which the film will be shown, the actors are selected and it turns out ‚ÄúMy Fair Nanny‚Äù.  You should not even be afraid - the film already has its own success story, and people are the same everywhere, it is known in advance that the project will be commercially successful. <br>  It was this algorithm that was used in the new action movie of Timur Bekmambetov ‚ÄúEspecially Dangerous‚Äù - in the original name - ‚ÄúWanted‚Äù.  Unhappy Mark Millar, the author of the Wanted comic, did not even suspect that his work of art would turn into such plagiarism. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <em>Open the brackets.</em> <br>  The producers were faced with the task of increasing the investors' oil money.  A team of screenwriters was hired and the most successful films of the last ten years were carefully analyzed.  The choice was on ‚ÄúThe Matrix,‚Äù especially since the comic was like her. <br><br>  Practically nothing was necessary to alter: <br>  The usual programmer was replaced by the usual clerk, Trinity - Angelina Jolie, the Chief "chief" would remain black, as in the Matrix, otherwise the film would have turned out not to be politically correct. <br>  Just like in the Matrix, the hero faces a global task - to prevent chaos.  Just as in the ‚ÄúMatrix‚Äù, the hero is ‚Äúopened his eyes‚Äù to who he really is.  ‚ÄúThe Da Vinci Code‚Äù did not pass by either - the Ancient Brotherhood of Weavers would be instead.

      <strong>A bit about the Matrix</strong> <br>  let's remember what impression the movie made (!).  The Wachowski brothers really made a splash not only in the cinema, but also in the minds of each of us. <br>  The word "MATRIX" has become a household name, which it still is. <br><br>  We decided not to waste time on trifles.  Furor is such a sensation, the blessing of petrodollars is enough.  Taking photos of everything is the same without Jolie and Freeman - the film would be a success only in the Russian box office, thanks to the name of Bekmambetov.  Therefore, they did not save on the actors (by the way, Jolie's jacket from ‚ÄúWanted‚Äù is already sold on <a href="http://www.ebay.com/">www.ebay.com</a> . The rate is about 7000 usd) Everything else is a matter of technology and special effects. <br>  <strong>Part Two: Technique and Special Effects.</strong> <br>  Enough to practice on the "Watch" and having a huge budget Bekmambetov decided not to save on special effects.  Slightly overdone with ‚ÄúBullet Time‚Äù of course.  Let me remind you that a special film effect, called ‚ÄúBullet Time‚Äù, was invented and brought to life by the same Wachowski in The Matrix. <br>  Too often, a collision and turning into pellets of two bullets is shown. <br>  From innovations in ‚ÄúBullet Time‚Äù I would note the twisting and changing of the bullet's trajectory with the movement of hands. <br><br>  Copyright effects I saw only two <br>  <em>- At full</em> speed, the main character is put in the car (instead of the red Mazda 3 (‚ÄúDay Watch‚Äù), there was a red Ferrary here) and it was filmed very effectively. <br>  <em>- unable</em> to break through the armored glass, the protagonist flies in his car, at the same time turns over, flying over the victim‚Äôs car and kills the victim through the opened top hatch.  Then the rollover continues until the car lands on the other side of the highway and continues driving. <br><br>  Separately pay attention to the scene from the supermarket, where the main character first meets the heroine Jolie.  One to one resembles a scene from the Day Watch, where the main villain is dancing a deadly dance with Bones. <br><br>  <strong>Conclusion: the</strong> film was shot on the matrix "Matrix", but he could not see such success as I did not understand how TNT explosives were fastened to each rat. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/28116/">https://habr.com/ru/post/28116/</a></p>
