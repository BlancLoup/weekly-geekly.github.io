  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Jobs in Japan: A Guide to Action</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Since there was a wave of posts about Japan on Habr√©, and many commentators had questions about how to go there, how to find work there, etc., I decided to share with you my rich experience.  In addition, I will try to fill in the gaps, talk about legal intricacies, and how to stay here.  If possible, I will use Russian terms, sometimes English, so as not to impede reading.  If someone is interested in the Japanese name, ask questions, I will add.  So let's go. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Visa </h4><br>  In Japan, there are several categories of visas, each of which has several status of residence.  They give (or do not give) the rights to various activities, such as work, study, part-time work, and so on.  Consider them all (except transit and tourism) in order. <br><ul><li>  <b>Diplomatic and official visa.</b>  They are unlikely to interest us, since they are issued only to officials, and are valid only for the period of the diplomatic mission.  If you can get it, then you do not need to read this post - you already know everything. </li><li>  <b>Work Visa.</b>  This is the most interesting category.  In addition to such statuses as a professor, instructor, etc., it contains very important statuses - an engineer, a researcher and an investor.  It is issued for 1 or 3 years, depending on the decision of the immigration bureau.  You can‚Äôt affect it at all, but as a rule, the longer you are here, the more chances to get a visa for three years.  All of these statuses, as well as diplomatic categories, allow you to work in Japan.  All the statuses listed below do not allow you to work full-time, but you can get permission for a part-time job for up to 28 hours a week from the City office. </li><li>  <b>Temporary visa.</b>  Issued for 15 or 90 days.  You can get it only if you are invited by a Japanese or Japanese company. </li><li>  <b>General visa.</b>  It includes 2 statuses for those who come to study for a long term (as a rule, a temporary visa is issued for up to 3 months), as well as status for those who come to participate in some kind of cultural initiative.  Issued for periods ranging from 6 months to 2 years.  This also includes the status of Dependent, according to which you can bring your spouse to Japan. </li><li>  <b>Special visa</b> .  It can be received by spouses / children of the Japanese or those who are here on the status of Permanent resident.  In addition, in this category there is still the status of long-term resident for those who suddenly decided to become a refugee. </li><li>  <b>Special statuses without a visa</b> .  This includes permanent resident and Japanese national.  About how to get them, I'll tell you below. </li></ul><br>  <i>*note.</i>  <i>In connection with the change in legislation, some visas are now issued for a period of not 1 year, but 1 year and three months, in particular, to allow students to find work after graduation.</i> <br><br><h4>  Do I need to know Japanese / English? </h4><br>  English is needed, and you should be fluent in it.  Even in spite of the fact that the Japanese do not speak much of it (except for the heads in the companies, which ex officio have to communicate with foreigners).  If you are going to a foreign company, then without it anywhere.  If in Japanese, knowledge of the English language greatly increases your chances of employment.  As well as the chances that you will be periodically sent on business trips.

      Japanese is very, very desirable.  In foreign companies, sometimes there are vacancies in which knowledge of Japanese is not required.  But much more often you need employees who know him.  Knowledge is assessed according to the results of the Japanese Language Proficiency Test (JLPT), which has 5 levels, from N5 (green beginner) to N1 (experienced wolf).  The exam is held 2 times a year, in the spring and in the fall on the N5-N3, in the summer and in the winter on the N2-N1.  Results become known after 3 months.  As a rule, good N2 is enough to work even in a Japanese firm. <br><br><h4>  How to get there? </h4><br>  First you need to decide who you would like to be in Japan.  There are not so many options - a student, a researcher, an engineer, an investor (and one secret option).  Yes, of course you can be on the content of a Japanese wife, but she still needs to be found.  Suppose also that you are in Russia.  For residents of America / Europe, everything is somewhat simplified, from obtaining a visa to finding a job. <br><br><h5>  Student </h5><br>  If you are determined to study in Japan, but have not yet entered a university, please note that school education in Japan lasts a year longer than in Russia, so for 1 year you will have to complete a special education course.  Perhaps it will be a little easier to enroll in a university / college from a Japanese language school - the latter usually provide additional training, interviews with teachers, etc.  It is worth studying at the university from 600k to 1.2m yen per year. <br><br>  You can, of course, enroll in not only a bachelor‚Äôs degree, but also a master‚Äôs degree.  To do this, it is enough to have a diploma of higher education and pass (as in the case of undergraduate) exams.  I spent a year at a Japanese university as an auditing student.  What can I say?  The level of teachers is very good, but the learning process itself, of course, is only in Japanese.  Some universities have lectures in English, but I would not count on it.  If you make friends with the professor, he can give exam tasks in English.  The rating system is from S (91-100% is true), A (81-90% is true) to D. The latter is equivalent to two. <br><br><h5>  Researcher </h5><br>  In this version, you need to ask for some Japanese professor in the researchers.  I did not do it myself, but I knew several people who got here this way.  At the same time, it is not necessary to study at university / graduate school at the moment.  You will need - recommendations from the dean, head.  chairs, etc., in English, the more the better.  A completed work plan of at least 3000 characters will be required.  You will need to find a grant for your project (look at the websites of Japanese universities), as well as a professor who conducts research on a similar topic (again, they are all on the websites). <br><br>  Next, you will need to write (in English) the selected professor a letter, say that there is such a grant, attach recommendations and work plan and wait for an answer.  If the grant is not found, you can also try a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monbukagakusho_Scholarship">Monbugakusho</a> scholarship, but note that units are getting it.  A red diploma is required.  Publications - desirable. <br><br><h5>  Engineer </h5><br>  This way I got here.  We will not consider the obvious option - to receive an invitation from a Japanese company.  A company that agrees to take you out of Russia is very, very difficult to find if you are not an exceptional super-specialist, and it is precisely you who are so lacking in Japan.  What if there is no such company?  The answer is simple - look for her.  And look, being in Japan.  And for this you need to get there on some other visa.  Or Temporary, if you have a Japanese friend who can invite you.  Or get a visa with the status of a Precollege student. <br><br>  It gives a lot of language schools.  You can use the services of a special office, which will deal with the paperwork.  For example gaku.ru.  But you can directly contact the school.  Detailed requirements and design process are set out on the gaku website.  I can only say that studying in Japan, in a language school, often costs less than courses of the same duration in Moscow, and is about 240 thousand rubles a year.  In the year of residence (food, housing, transport) will require an additional 500 thousand rubles.  During this time, you can pull up the Japanese from zero to N3 (N2 if you try very hard).  In two years and before N1, but in this case, the costs, of course, double.  At the end, it will be possible to calmly search for work, especially since the process is not quick, and takes from 3 to 6 months. <br><br>  Yes, if you are a citizen of Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Korea, New Zealand, Taiwan, Hong Kong or England - you are lucky.  Your country has special agreements with Japan, and you can get a so-called.  Working Holiday Visa, for a period of 6 months to 1 year, and do what you want in Japan.  Very comfortably. <br><br><h5>  Investor </h5><br>  This is an option for the rich.  But in fact, not so much required.  Even being in Japan on a tourist visa, you have the right to open your company.  It is best to turn to English-speaking lawyers who will help to collect all the necessary documents.  In order to get a visa with the status of business / investor, it is necessary for your company to either work full-time two Japanese, or the share capital should be at least 5 million yen.  That is about 40 thousand dollars. <br><br>  In addition, if you graduated from a Japanese university and suddenly decided to open your company, you can, upon request, be given an additional 6 months for the whole procedure, with monthly verification and reporting. <br><br><h4>  How to search for a job? </h4><br>  Suppose you chose the 3rd option.  Got any visa, arrived, began to act.  The search is best to start with the <a href="http://www.careercross.com/">CareerCross</a> and <a href="http://www.daijob.com/">DaiJob sites</a> , if you are involved in corporate systems, and your languages ‚Äã‚Äãare C ++, Java or C #.  Experience with databases, usually Oracle, Sybase or DB2 is very welcome.  Experience developing under Linux / Solaris too.  If your path is web development, you can still watch the work on <a href="http://www.green-japan.com/">Green Japan</a> . <br><br>  Most likely you will communicate not directly, but through recruiters.  Therefore, you can see the work and on their sites.  The best offices I know are <a href="http://www.skillhouse.co.jp/">Skillhouse</a> and <a href="http://morganmckinley.co.jp/">Morgan McKinley</a> .  But you can also pay attention to TradeWinds Consulting, Aptus Consulting, as well as directly to such firms as Microsoft and Google. <br><br>  Now about the difference between Japanese and foreign companies.  She is quite big. <br><ul><li> There are holidays in foreign firms, while in Japanese you are given just a few days off for a year, usually around 12, and then their number grows.  You can‚Äôt take a lot in a row, so it‚Äôs impossible to arrange a vacation.  The Japanese often add them from different sides to the golden vetch and New Year‚Äôs holidays, due to which they are very well elongated. </li><li>  In Japanese companies, there is no sick leave.  If you are sick, you will spend the days of their time off.  If the time off is over, you certainly can not come, after warning the boss, but this day will be deducted from your salary and bonus. </li><li>  Japanese companies often compensate for payment for housing (from 20 to 100%), payment for travel, give 2 bonuses per year in the amount of 2-3 salaries.  But on the other hand, in Japanese firms and the salary is much lower than in foreign ones. </li><li>  In Japanese companies, it is customary to recycle (this word is probably better for you to remember - ÊÆã Ê•≠ - dzangyo, recycling).  Depending on the company, it may be of different lengths, may or may not be paid.  Where I worked, we processed an average of 2 hours a day.  At the same time, processing on Saturday (for example, and closing the version) was paid 10% more, and on Sunday, at a double rate.  So the Japanese, too, do not just sit until midnight. </li></ul><br><br>  A few more facts about Japanese companies.  Attitudes towards foreigners are normal there, especially after going to corporate booze a couple of times.  This is such a feature of the Japanese mentality - the separation of people into friends and foes, at all levels, from country to company and family.  So, if you fell to work with the Japanese - you become your own.  The Japanese really love to work on the instructions.  But this does not mean that there are no creative people.  They are just a little.  In the software development industry, fortunately, there are much more such people, but unfortunately, not among managers.  Although there are and they come across good.  And the Japanese love to hold meetings, for any reason.  For example, how to answer calls correctly.  Or how neater to ride a bike. <br><br>  The system of life-long employment in Japan, legally, is long gone (30 years since it disappeared).  In practice, the salary depends on the length of service, and it often makes no sense to change jobs.  Especially if you have a family, and yes even a house in a mortgage.  Therefore, the Japanese are sitting in the same place - leaving, you have to start all over again, regardless of your knowledge.  It is easier for foreigners in this regard - we know English and can always go to a foreign company.  But if you really decided on the Japanese, choose carefully. <br><br><h4>  Accommodation </h4><br>  In short, your choice is limited by your cash.  If you are a student in a language school, she will provide you with a hostel.  Sometimes the hostel can provide and company, if you do not mind living in cramped quarters.  Payment usually amounts to 2-3 mana yen (mans - 10,000 anything, 1 man yen is about 3,000 rubles), including utilities and the Internet.  A little better conditions can be obtained by settling in the guesthouse.  This is almost an apartment, in the sense that you will be alone in the room.  But the toilet, kitchen and bathroom are still common.  This is a very convenient option if you want to rent an apartment, but you can‚Äôt do it right away (for example, upon arrival, since it takes about 3 weeks to issue an alien registration card).  There is a guesthouse about 5-6 mans, komunalka and the Internet are included in the price.  You can pay in advance by credit card via the Internet. <br><br>  Finally, you can rent an apartment.  This is a somewhat dreary and very expensive process.  The Japanese even have such an expression, Âºï Ë∂ä „Åó Ë≤ß‰πè, hikkoschi bingbo: or the poor after the move.  Depending on the area of ‚Äã‚Äãresidence and the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe apartment can cost from 3 to 50 mana per month.  For 3 you will remove something the size of 16-18 square meters (I have just this).  However, you will have to pay much more at the entrance.  What are the costs?  Here is a list: <br><ul><li> Á§ºÈáë, raikin, or, based on the hieroglyphs, money in gratitude.  This is a gift to the owner of the house for the fact that he agreed to shelter you.  This money does not return, and very few people take it (5 years ago the situation was worse).  They were introduced, as far as I know, after a large earthquake in Kobe, when there was simply nowhere to live.  When a raikin is present, it amounts to 1 to 3 monthly sums. </li><li> Êï∑ Èáë, u (i) kikin, or pledge.  It also makes up from 1 to 3 monthly sums.  At the end of the contract returns. </li><li> ‰øùË®ºÈáë, hosh: kin, or insurance money.  The fact is that a foreigner can not just rent an apartment.  For him, the Japanese or Japanese company must necessarily be charged.  And if you are not working yet, then you have to use the services of a third-party company.  One monthly amount. </li><li>  Payment to realtors.  Another monthly amount. </li><li>  Apartment insurance, not to be confused with insurance money.  You can not pay it, usually in the region of the 1st monthly amount. </li><li>  Sanitation  Cleaning the apartment from the previous owner.  It will have to do, it is about 2-3 mans. </li></ul><br>  Well, of course, the fee for the first month, plus if you do not live in a single-story house, but in a man-made block, that is, a multi-quatin house, a monthly payment for maintenance (cleaning the house, elevator, etc.) While I pay for an apartment 3 mana per month plus 5 thousand for the service, at the entrance I paid about 18 mana.  The contract is usually made for 2 years.  It‚Äôs impossible to settle with anyone, but if, for example, parents came to visit you, no one will be outraged.  It is also impossible to start pets (with the exception of fish and hamsters). <br><br><h4>  As a conclusion </h4><br>  Among foreigners living here, it is often the opinion that the fewer foreigners in Japan, the better the country.  This point of view has the right to exist, because only a few Gaijins here really try to understand Japanese culture and work.  The rest, most of them Americans, simply parasitize Japanese society.  Therefore, this post I did what some people asked me not to do.  Now your guide to action.  Angoy :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/114215/">https://habr.com/ru/post/114215/</a></p>
