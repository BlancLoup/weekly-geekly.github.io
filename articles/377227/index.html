However, investors believe in the capabilities of the company, and motorists in the capabilities of electric vehicles.  At first glance, Tesla is doing well: sales are growing, electric cars are becoming more and more popular, and the network of electric filling stations is expanding, which is one of the main conditions for the further development of the company's business. <br><br>  But there are risks, and there are a lot of them.  It may seem that the loss-making company and the loss of investor interest are the main and only problem. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  But it is not, some risks are <a href="http://www.foxbusiness.com/technology/2015/03/05/teslas-new-voluminous-risk-disclosures/">implicit, but significant</a> .

    <h3>  The first risk is a loss of confidence in electric vehicles, reputation losses. </h3><br><br>  Yes, the company's cars break down equipment on crash tests, <a href="http://geektimes.ru/post/241024/">demonstrating its reliability</a> .  Problems with batteries and other Tesla are also not so frequent.  But what will happen if the owner of an <a href="http://uk.businessinsider.com/tesla-to-owners-please-dont-pimp-your-rides-2015-3">electric car decides to modify something</a> according to his own understanding?  We have a lot of skilled craftsmen, but not everyone has enough knowledge to change the configuration of any systems in such complex equipment as Tesla's electric car. <br><br>  Banal installation of a powerful acoustic installation can already unbalance the electrical system, something can overheat, somewhere there will be a short circuit - and that‚Äôs all, an accident.  But none of the journalists who will cover such an accident, will not understand the intricacies of the wiring.  The accident (it would be nice, without victims), and that's it - and went headlines like "Tesla kills its fans", "Electric monster on wheels finds another victim," and the like. <br><br>  Buyers, of course, are very sensitive to this kind of information.  Sales may fall.  This is a real risk for the company, so the representatives of Tesla even spoke officially, asking them not to change anything in the electric car.  That is absolutely nothing. <br><br><h3>  The second risk is non-profitability. </h3><br><br>  <a href="http://megamozg.ru/post/10520/">This is a very noticeable danger</a> , because some investors may lose their patience, and will begin to demand a return on investment, or simply interfere with the work of the company, which is now managed, in fact, by one person - Ilon Mask.  Shares of the company have already lost in price from 294 US dollars to 177.22 apiece.  The company was profitable only once - in the first quarter of 2013. <br><br>  Nevertheless, Tesla is a rather expensive company - its total value is now estimated at 25.5 billion US dollars, which is 42% of GM's market price.  Last year 31655 cars were sold, all according to plan.  Now Musk is building a ‚Äú <a href="http://geektimes.ru/post/236711/">Gigafabrika battery</a> ‚Äù and plans to sell batteries for households.  At the start of all these projects significant funds are required, which are provided by the state and investors. <br><br>  Ilon Musk is quite optimistic: in 10 years he hopes to level the market capitalization of his company with the capitalization of Apple. <br><br><h3>  Third Risk - Sales and Law </h3><br><br>  Despite all the positive aspects of the company's business, there are additional problems.  For example, in some states, <a href="http://geektimes.ru/post/244105/">traditional car dealers are fighting</a> with the company.  And their attempts are quite successful - in some states of the USA Tesla salons can either close at all, or sales are reduced to a <a href="http://geektimes.ru/post/240412/">certain value</a> that violates the plans of the company itself. <br><br>  In addition, the slightest accident can lead to changes in the legislation of individual states or the whole of the United States related to the safety of batteries, wiring, individual elements of the design of electric vehicles.  So, in 2013, there were several annoying accidents involving the ignition of batteries.  But then the company solved this problem by <a href="http://geektimes.ru/post/217497/">installing an additional titanium shield</a> . <br><br><h3>  Fourth risk - underdeveloped charging station infrastructure </h3><br><br>  Yes, they are getting bigger.  But companies have to conduct difficult negotiations with the administration of the region, where they plan to put the stations, with landowners and partners.  As a result, the number of charging stations is not growing as fast as the situation requires and the owners of electric cars want. <br><br>  On the other hand, company representatives are making every effort to ensure that the network of charging stations becomes more and more deployed.  To do this, contracts with other automakers (for example, BMW), bonuses are offered to landowners. <br><br><h3>  Fifth risk - service </h3><br><br>  In any, even the smallest city of any country, you can find a service station where Uncle Vasya or Ombre Juan will be able to solve many problems with your car.  Broken gearbox?  No problem.  Is there something wrong with the wheels?  Fix it.  Wiring problems are also solved. <br><br>  Everything is wrong with Tesla.  Externally - this is a car.  But what is inside is very different from all the usual auto repair systems.  An elementary problem with the wiring or navigation system in Tesla can turn into the impossibility of repair in this region. <br><br>  However, most Tesla service centers are located in the United States.  And what if an electric car was bought by a resident of Nizhny Novgorod or Gomel, or Nikolayev, and something broke?  Not one uncle Vasya will undertake to repair it, unless he is, of course, ‚ÄúLefty.‚Äù <br><br>  Nevertheless, while all these problems are being solved on the sly, Ilon Mask and his managers manage the company quite effectively, finding unexpected ways to solve emerging issues.  And by the way, there are a <a href="http://geektimes.ru/post/244125/">few more reasons that will not allow the company to drown</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/377227/">https://habr.com/ru/post/377227/</a></p>
