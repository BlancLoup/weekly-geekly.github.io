So soon it went - others are running after the boars, until we use their benefits in exchange for another wall heroic story for distant archaeologists who will never understand why one should sharpen a spear and a brush, and the most ancient drawings will fly around tens of thousands of years after how our new pictures will go to dust. <br><br>  <strong>And even more ...</strong> <br>  When the way ‚ÄúI learn to learn myself ‚Äî I'll grind myself ‚Äî I'll kill myself ‚Äî I'll cook myself ‚Äî I‚Äôll eat‚Äù was broken, the first cracks appeared on the stone of character. <br>  When the professions appeared, the artists started, and then the era of Ford began.  Of course, rock art began to cause more interest than at the time of the authors, but it no longer inspires our children, who have been brought up for a hundred years away from cities.

      Mankind is like a shy spaniel who reads poems to the next and last in his life bowl of cakes. <br><br>  <strong>A little bit about the Internet</strong> <br>  Soon, hand-made sites will be valued as the worst Stradivari violins (out of respect for Stradivari).  Or like copies of Stradivarius violins :) <br>  Already today, to fart on the web, creating your blog on WordPress, painting it with templates and scoring to the eyeballs with easily accessible content, you do not need to move your finger, let alone liveJournal diaries and other services. <br>  Thousands of ready-made templates, icons, banners, counters.  No need to think anymore - everything is invented before you, find out, look at it, eat it, consume it, relax it and feel for a while real mccoy until the web goes forward again, having thought it up and sold it to you yourself. <br><br>  <strong>Social web</strong> <br>  Many social services of the ‚Äúsecond echelon‚Äù, seeking to make money on the number of visitors, do not particularly care about what these visitors are doing.  An entire generation risks being brought up in an empty and noisy room in which they ask questions that are appropriate to any answers. <br><br>  After a hundred years, the sick children of our sick children will not tear off their fat asses to cover our children with a Scottish blanket, because our children will throw out the Scottish blanket! <br><br>  <strong>Web 4.0</strong> <br>  The third is clear - most likely, it will differ in technological advantage from the second approximately as Gilette with a large number of blades.  But a good achievement in the fourth web would still be to get social networks to the streets, so that at least there were more trees on them.  Well, for this you need to work hard on the desires of users. <br><br>  <strong>Web 2.0</strong> <br>  We are building a new system of subtle values, spiritual needs and satisfaction. <br><br>  Thanks for attention.
