I run a blog, and it can also be considered my project, but who does not currently blog?  A blog is run by many; in fact, a blog is one of the most popular activities on the Internet, and recently it has also become a very loose concept.  And here is my joke for a thousand units of some cryptocurrency: distribution has become my project. <a name="habracut"></a>  Why is this funny?  Because, who has no mailing now?  I myself subscribed to 20 pieces from various publications, shops, blogs (again they!). <br><br>  Why the choice fell on the newsletter?  I could have done a lot of things, but why the newsletter?  The answer will disappoint you: because it is easy.  More precisely, it is easier than all the other options that I could consider.  But honestly.  Even the topic of mailing is impossibly trivial, but one cannot say that it is quite easy.

    <blockquote>  Yes, this is a motivational letter. <br>  And the motivator of me, frankly so-so. </blockquote><br><br>  Why am I telling you this?  Because it is the most honest story of the launch and existence of the project.  I read them a lot like any person "in the subject." <br><br>  Run histories are written in two cases: <br>  - you have succeeded and awl in an interesting place does not give you peace <br>  - you did not succeed, but you came out of the water, so you are not ashamed to talk about it. <br>  And there are stories of failures, they are written for similar reasons: <br>  - you came off the hook and share a story of failure and lessons learned in the hope that your audience is smart people and they will learn from your mistakes. <br>  - you write about the failure of one of your projects to boast of your new project, with which you have succeeded. <br>  <i>And I write because it's cool when you can write and ease your soul, and can get valuable advice in the comments.</i> <br><br>  How it all began?  I sit, read a book, and then bam!  Spark, storm, keep reading the book.  But in my head there is already a little worm sitting in a brain maze, telling me that it is time.  It is my time.  My wife received such letters for a while and was even in a closed group with my future target audience.  It remained to do everything right.  And it seems that I screwed up somewhere.  I designed the landing page with Wix.  I came up with a name, attached a Google address collection form, but squeezed money to buy a normal domain.  As a result, if the site is somehow indexed by search engines, it makes it very bad.  Well, to hell with him!  Then another misfortune began: I had no idea, even a basic knowledge, how to make mailings from a purely technical point of view.  I couldn‚Äôt just send one email from a regular email account.  I started searching and found MailChimp by a short search.  Well, as I figured out the settings you are not interested, so we omit this moment.  All preparations are over and it's time to launch an ‚Äúadvertising‚Äù campaign.  I asked my wife to place a link in my group, showed all my friends on social networks and waited.  So a number of addresses was typed.  I waited a week, their number did not increase, which means the exhaust was over, and it was time to make a letter.  This process is even more boring than how I dealt with mailing settings. <br><br>  So began my project.  On Friday evening, I sent the second letter (!).  Despite the small exhaust and a small amount of collected addresses, I received more than half of the opening letter.  This can be considered a modest, very modest but a success.  It is such positive moments that make everyone move on.  It seems to me that even modern measures of success, such as Zuckerberg, Musk and others, were in my place.  They think that a certain number of people who read this text were also in my place. <br>  So, there is my project.  I am going to send the next letter on Monday, because I promised to do this regularly and on Friday and Monday.  And somewhere, it seems in the blog Go!  Practice I read that the habits of your users make your <a href="http://gopractice.ru/retention/">success</a> . <br><br>  Good luck! <br>  Your project and success is already waiting for you, just start acting the way you like it! <br><br>  PS honesty, frankly, not such a cool character trait. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/301366/">https://habr.com/ru/post/301366/</a></p>
