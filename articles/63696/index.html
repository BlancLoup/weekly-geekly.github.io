  <section class="page js-page"><h1>"Runner" visiting PA AdLabs</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  June 11, employees of the company ‚ÄúRunner‚Äù came to visit us.  This has become a good tradition - once a year to arrange training, share experiences, discuss market trends, argue, certify, and improve staff skills.  This year, the training was called "Increasing sales", which is very important in the new market conditions. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4ff/c8b/05f/4ffc8b05f9ce9638ead3e775c3a96851.jpg" alt="image"><br>  We have been training for quite some time.  We collected questions from managers who dealt with work with the ‚ÄúRunner‚Äù system, divided them into groups according to topics, organized brainstorming sessions and generated questions all together.  They thought up how to make the training interesting. <br>  The training began with a small assessment of employees.  We divided into two teams and answered questions that the Runner had prepared for us.  The winning team received J prizes from Runner. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d42/348/020/d42348020f246e4fb585aeedb8d164c5.jpg" alt="image"><br>  The training program was very intense.  Svetlana Ermachenkova, Lead Account Manager, Personal Care Department, Begun, <br>  told how the runners themselves plan advertising campaigns.  She analyzed the real cases of our agency in order to compare the approaches to media planning. <br>  Much attention at the training was paid to the thematic network ‚ÄúRunner‚Äù.  Contextual advertising has long ceased to be perceived only as advertising in search engines (search advertising).  The Internet is changing over time - people live on the Internet, using it no longer as it used to.  Accordingly, they not only use search, but spend a lot of time on other resources (these are popular social networks, blogs, forums, information resources, etc.). <br>  In many topics, the traffic on the search is not enough for the client to get the result he expected.  Traffic on the network is cheaper, it is more, but, undoubtedly, the conversion in networks is lower than with search.  In general, in many topics the number of attracted customers from networks is greater due to the amount of traffic. <br>  When solving many problems without connecting networks, it is impossible to achieve a result - therefore, we should not forget about this when planning advertising campaigns.  The thematic network of ‚ÄúRunner‚Äù is growing, and the share of search traffic from the Rambler is falling.  ‚ÄúRunner‚Äù is very different as the system for placing contextual advertising from Yandex.Direct, because the share of search traffic is small.  And you can not plan placement in the "Runner" as well as Yandex.Direct is planned. <br>  We talked separately about the IBC on the Rambler.  Once again remembered where it is better to use this carrier.  Do not forget that in topics with a high transition cost, ICD can be cheaper. <br>  Alexey Romanenkov, the commercial director of Begun, told about the ‚ÄúClassics of Marketing in Internet Advertising‚Äù.  A lot of interesting information was devoted to demographic targeting - ‚ÄúRunner‚Äù has a lot of experience using this setting.  Alexey's speeches are always vivid and memorable.  He showed several videos in the topic, which the audience perceived with a bang. <br>  Vram Sargsyan, a specialist for the Beguna dealership department, presented the new Runner interface.  While many features are not yet available, but gradually there will be more features in the new interface.  It is much more convenient than the previous one. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/83d/ac0/3f3/83dac03f3053f041add91095b933e992.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Toward the close of the agency and the staff handed diplomas.  Everyone expressed what he remembered this training day. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9c9/c90/605/9c9c90605f35d6ef5ab9996200ec767c.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Such meetings allow you to take something new for your work, expand your opinion and look differently at the already familiar things.  Team ‚ÄúRunner‚Äù - thanks for the new material, valuable tips and positive emotions.  We will increase sales! <br><br>  <a href="http://www.adlabs.ru/posts/79/"><i>Nadezhda Shilova</i></a> <a href="http://www.adlabs.ru/doc/adv/">RA Adlabs</a> </div>
