      The previous edition of the information digest can be found at <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/itinvest/blog/244862/">this link</a> . <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Currency markets </h4><br>  The past week began with the S &amp; P agency‚Äôs downgrade of the country's credit rating to ‚Äútrash‚Äù and the subsequent fall of the ruble ‚Äî in the middle of the week, the euro was trading <a href="http://top.rbc.ru/finances/28/01/2015/54c8e68e9a79475a82fcdf07">above</a> 77 rubles, and the dollar <a href="http://top.rbc.ru/finances/29/01/2015/54c9ed989a794741b5bf9a42">exceeded</a> 69 rubles. <br><br>  On Friday, January 30, the Central Bank announced a reduction in the key rate by 2 percentage points - from 17% to 15% per annum.  According to Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov, this was done because the authorities managed to slow down the fall of the ruble.  The minister said that the ruble exchange rate is now " <a href="http://top.rbc.ru/finances/30/01/2015/54cb78539a7947ddc7b93045">is equilibrium</a> ."  The head of the Central Bank Elvira Nabiullina <a href="http://www.rbc.ru/rbcfreenews/54cb7b3e9a7947e338f584da">said</a> that the rate of 15% is sufficient to slow down inflation. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ed1/4a5/ab2/ed14a5ab2af56fadc9e8f1b68e17c318.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <i>Fotobank / Getty Images</i> <br><br>  Here's how this decision was <a href="http://www.itinvest.ru/analytics/reviews/world-markets/8548/">commented on by</a> Sergey Egishyants, chief economist of ITinvest, in his weekly review: <br><br><blockquote>  The Bank of Russia suddenly reduced its key rate by 2% to 15% - the explanation is that inflation will fall due to weak demand and a growing credit collapse.  It is logical, but after all, this state of affairs was also in December - but the percentage was then thrown upwards: it was raised not because of prices, but because of the ruble - meanwhile, the latter does not grow, to put it mildly.  Want to help the real sector?  - but for him that 15%, that 17%, in general, about the same thing: the beyond.  Therefore, it is not easy to understand the logic of the Central Bank - therefore the market is frightened: in October-December, he saw the confusion of the authorities turning into panic (that is why the ruble was torn off the roof on December 16) - recently everything seemed to calm down, but now a new strange decision has come. </blockquote><br>  Immediately after the announcement of the news about the reduction of the key rate on the stock exchange, there was another jump in the dollar and euro rates - the American currency rose in price to 71.8 rubles.  (3 rubles higher than the previous day's close), and the euro - up to 81.55 rubles.  (3,875 rubles higher than the previous day‚Äôs closing level). <br><br>  Such movements did not embarrass the authorities - First Deputy Prime Minister Igor Shuvalov <a href="http://www.rbc.ru/rbcfreenews/54ce530d9a79470898e2900f">advised</a> Russians to get used to the unstable exchange rate of the ruble (earlier at a forum in Davos, he stated that the current crisis <a href="http://top.rbc.ru/economics/23/01/2015/54c20f4c9a794781edc93064">would be more serious</a> than in 2008).  In support of this, the Ministry of Economic Development and Trade <a href="http://top.rbc.ru/economics/31/01/2015/54ccd4179a79474d2a10edbb">voiced a</a> forecast on the level of the fall of the Russian economy - according to experts of the department, the decline will be 3%. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5b1/b62/e58/5b1b62e58e43e24e8490425a58e52a9f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <i>Photo: <a href="https://news.mail.ru/economics/20600320/gallery/3937938/">News.Mail.ru</a></i> <br><br>  The new week began on the stock exchange with a <a href="http://www.vedomosti.ru/finance/news/38910021/dollar-i-evro-vyrosli-k-rublyu-otygryvaya-kolebaniya-cen">fall</a> in the ruble exchange rate - and the dollar and the euro took levels higher than the close on Friday.  Even the news about increased oil prices did not help the Russian currency: Brent for most of the last week was trading at $ 48-49 per barrel, but during the last January trading, the price rose sharply, exceeding $ 53 per barrel at the maximum.  On Monday, ICE futures prices for March delivery fluctuated between $ 51 and $ 52 a barrel. <br><br>  Sergey Egishyants described the situation on the oil market as follows: <br><br><blockquote>  Oil and gas continued to stand at the bottom, despite the widespread decline of wells in the United States and the complaints of OPEC secretary general Al-Badri, they say, if everyone now stops investing because of cheapness, then after a couple of years the price can soar up to 200 bucks per barrel;  At the same time, the head of Goldman Sachs Kohn (the oil trader himself in the past) promises 30 soon. It seems to us that the bottoms will be there until the end of the first quarter - after which a rather vigorous rebound will take place: how vigorous it depends on the resulting minimums - let's wait a bit although it may not be necessary to wait, because under the closing of the month oil rose vertically. </blockquote><br>  According to Bloomberg analysts, the ruble, quite possibly, <a href="http://top.rbc.ru/finances/02/02/2015/54cf23a09a794740ec1734b2">has not yet reached the bottom</a> and may continue to fall. <br><br><h4>  Stock markets </h4><br>  The start of last week in the Russian stock market was in a negative way.  The MICEX ruble index lost within 2%, and the RTS currency index sank by almost 4%. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1e7/7de/c0d/1e77dec0d2e2727f9f2a0db72203e6be.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <i>Photo: Sergey Karpukhin / Reuters</i> <br><br>  ITinvest expert Vasyl Oleinik <a href="http://www.itinvest.ru/analytics/reviews/oleynik/8542/">named</a> among the reasons for investors' concern the aggravation of the situation in Ukraine and the growth of geopolitical risks: <br><br><blockquote>  [...] The conclusion is that February will not be the best month for investors, so it‚Äôs clearly not to hurry now with long-term purchases. </blockquote><br>  A week, however, the main Russian stock indices closed <a href="http://bankir.ru/novosti/s/indeks-mmvb-pribavil-0-5-indeks-rts-upal-na-1-4-10097783/">multidirectionally</a> - MICEX added 0.5% and amounted to 1,647.69 points, the RTS index fell 1.4% to 737.35 points. <br><br>  Forecasts for 2015 <br><br>  RBC-TV economic observer Zhanna Nemtsova discussed with the head of investor relations at Severstal PJSC, Vladimir Zaluzhsky, the situation in the markets of metallurgists and exporters, the new cycle in the commodity market and forecasts of its development, as well as the possibility of buying Eurobonds, including for a wide range Investors on the Moscow Exchange <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/Lwm0vA9hW0w%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhizCLkGMzQkyx38FB50_laheYmcSg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  That's all, thank you for your attention.
