      Nowadays, this is not a prerequisite for success.  Brands and advertisers are now obsessed with reaching their target audience using algorithmic advertising procurement.  Such is the professional tautology: achieving success through reaching the target audience using the achievements of the high-tech market of advertising solutions. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Despite some obsession with this technology, programmatic is still considered a novelty that many market players still cannot truly understand.  According to a report by the Association of National Advertisers (ANA), back in May last year, only a measly 26% of marketers said they were aware of the existence of algorithmic advertising purchases.  Today, this figure has grown significantly, but even though the costs of programmatic buying are constantly increasing, something is still holding back marketing specialists. <br><br>  Millward Brown Digital conducted a survey and found that 88% of marketers who work for Fortune 5000 companies said that creating emotional connections through digital media would encourage them to spend more on Internet branding. <br><br>  Don Draper, of course, would agree with this 88 percent.  He was famous for his ability to create close ties with people in order to sell products and services of such iconic brands as Jaguar, Hilton Hotels and Lucky Strike.  So what would a cult advertiser do if he were lucky enough to be in our time? <br><br>  He would definitely focus on how to measure the effectiveness and performance of an advertising campaign.  His main concern in the era of the 1960s was to see the advertisement as many potential buyers as possible.  He knew exactly which channels to use for this and on which billboards to place advertisements in order to ensure the maximum level of its ‚Äúvisibility‚Äù.  At that time, the workflow was much simpler due to the limited choice of tools.  In the end, the success of the campaigns conducted by Draper was determined by sales. <br><br>  Today, the effectiveness of any advertising campaign does not directly depend on how many consumers see the ad, but on how many ‚Äúright‚Äù consumers know about the product or service.  That is, those consumers who are more likely to be ready to be converted into customers and make a purchase, fulfilling the dream of any advertiser.  A campaign can be measured by applying a variety of metrics and standards: advertising "visibility", involvement, clickability, likes on social networks ... And it is the technology of algorithmic purchasing and advertising sales that allows brands to show their ads at the "right" users. <br><br>  Taking into account the fact that 90% of users prefer to skip one of the most popular video formats - pre-roll videos (video ads, anticipating the showing of the main video content), Don Draper's creative skills will undoubtedly be in demand to attract the viewer.  Today, there is a tendency for companies to increasingly create their own content.  And that is why the followers of the legendary Draper can find themselves in any industry as any of the CCO - the chief creative officer (chief creative director) or the chief content content officer (chief editor). <br><br>  The advertising industry has evolved rapidly over the past 50 years.  It‚Äôs hard to imagine that Draper‚Äôs team once had to choose between a computer and a temperamental creative director.  Today, market players also have to make fairly tough choices between programmatic, mobile platforms, social networks, and the creation of an intangible and non-measurable emotional connection with consumers. <br><br>  <b>So what would Don Draper say if he was in our time?</b>  He would definitely say that epochs and technologies may be different, however, both in the 1960s and in 2015, every advertiser using programmatic must step forward and create an emotional connection with his audience.  And only the first-class creative can help.  And if someone thinks that advertising creative has become a minor figure in the market equation, then he is definitely and very deeply mistaken.  Indeed, without the right creative approach to creating advertising for a hyper-targeted audience, the value of programmatics may well be reduced to nothing. <br><br> <a href="http://www.byyd.me/ru/register/%3Futm_source%3Dmegamozg%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3Dcontent_marketing"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/041/3c5/29a/0413c529a1424210a02b160e54a40e80.png"></a> <br><br>  <a href="http://www.byyd.me/ru/%3Futm_source%3Dmegamozg">BYYD ‚Ä¢ Mobile Advertising Platform</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/297580/">https://habr.com/ru/post/297580/</a></p>
