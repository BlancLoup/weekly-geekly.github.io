A few months ago we talked about the features of the Japanese car market.  Today, the next in line is the oil-rich United Arab Emirates.  It is there that works the closest relative of CarPrice - the auction SellAnyCar. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/o4/li/mi/o4limivw0f-lqpydeyffxbbi_vu.jpeg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In addition to Russia and Japan, online auctions that are part of the Car Buying Alliance group operate in Brazil, India, Nigeria, Mexico, Chile, Pakistan and Indonesia.  Among them, the Russian CarPrice is the largest in terms of revenue and volume of cars sold.  Despite the sometimes opposite economic situation in different countries, the business model of online car auctions successfully conquers the world, and the reason for this is mainly in global internetization and high smartphone penetration.  People around the world today want to buy and sell online, and no matter what it is, a bag of chips or a car. <br><br><h2>  Features of the local car market </h2><br>  As you may know, the UAE is a federal state consisting of seven emirates.  The size of the country is about 400 to 500 kilometers, most of the territory is a typical desert, like on the ‚ÄúKara Kum‚Äù candies.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/uk/jh/fw/ukjhfw0zri6nhcfypbn7yih0bsu.png"><br><br>  There are many cars in the UAE, and almost all of them are premium.  The safety of the machines is very good - around the desert, so there is no corrosion on the machines and cannot be in principle.  The cars here are sold in excellent condition, with a big discount from the original price and an unimaginable amount of the most diverse tuning. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/7b/ta/a6/7btaa6u33h-abuodsknres4z4si.jpeg"><br><br>  These are the machines in the Emirates are quite common. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/dc/ue/od/dcueodbeqfygi66kevmx-jpwvlk.jpeg"><br><br>  Public transport in our understanding - when millions of people move daily from point A to point B on buses or subways.  In the UAE there is no such thing.  In the largest city in the country, Dubai has a subway and trams, even buses come across, but all this is rather exotic.  With a price of a liter of gasoline at the level of 20-30 rubles (depending on the level of world prices), the car is the most economical and convenient means of transportation.  Here, by the way, is a typical UBER-taxi - Lexus ES 2016.  Try to guess the mileage of this machine? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/be/y-/cy/bey-cyxapyl_j7wolykqcjphqti.jpeg"><br><br>  When only she had time to run so much? <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fn/05/ss/fn05ssmgkeayj2dqot-j1da93re.jpeg"></div><br><h2>  Now a little more about the local version of CarPrice </h2><br>  Business SellAnyCar is booming.  The company occupies 10% of the market for used cars (for the auto business it is a lot) and is the largest marketplace of its segment in the region.  The reason for success, on the one hand, is in excellent condition of used cars, which make it easy to find new owners.  The second reason is the high volume of transactions with good margins.  The fact is that the indigenous people of the Emirates practically do not work, for them all the work is done by migrants from India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and other countries.  Of the nearly 9 million people in the UAE, approximately 70% are visitors.  Going home, these workers get rid of everything "acquired by overwork", including from cars.  Online auction allows you to quickly and without worries get rid of the property that has already become unnecessary on wheels.  What, of course, many use.  And how can you not use it when there is such a gigantic advertisement on the highways: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/aaa/e27/7f1/aaae277f10d05ddd5716c21d3f1f2fc2.jpg"><br><br>  The founder and CEO of SellAnyCar is a German entrepreneur of Turkish origin, a young billionaire Saygin Yalcin. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fa0/528/216/fa0528216fe17969c6483ca9432b56d6.jpg"></div><br>  Saygin is a local media star, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4r8l3rcFBr9xJ2PZd7zNhw">his YouTube channel</a> has about 600,000 subscribers, and videos collect several million views.  He himself says that high recognition makes it much more efficient to do business.  In the plots of Saygin, exclusive cars, dear racers, business jets are a complete set of oriental business gurus.  As a businessman, Saigin very correctly built a media strategy, making a lot of videos with top international and local bloggers.  All of this quickly gave its fruits, and today it has a high recognition not only at home but also outside the Emirates. <br><br>  In SellAnyCar, much is built around the personality of Saygin.  In particular, the company does not have a marketing director - Saygin himself quite successfully copes with this role.  Of course, this is not always justified, but the company's high business indicators suggest that its boss is doing everything right.  But back to the online auction. <br><br>  The main office of SellAnyCar looks like this. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/h7/nn/zz/h7nnzzd6elwpqckh56sy9hwy7ru.jpeg"><br><br>  This is a huge hangar, next to which the parking of purchased cars is located.  Sandstorms in the Emirates occur quite often, so many cars are covered with a centimeter layer of sand. <br><br>  By the way, a car inspection at SellAnyCar takes only half an hour.  The fact is that the vast majority of cars in the UAE have a clear history of purchase and ownership, which is set out in the service books.  In Russia, the inspection of any machine is deeper and more technological.  Try to guess why. <br><br>  Much of the time, residents of the UAE spend in shopping centers: not only shops are concentrated there, but also a lot of unexpected entertainment.  But the main thing is that it‚Äôs cool there, and it attracts locals and tourists like a magnet.  That's why 11 of the 16 branches of SellAnyCar are located in large shopping centers.  There are such islands in all large malls: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/15/ix/5a/15ix5ag33afxejlekkq5fji6pl8.jpeg"><br><br>  It is quite convenient.  You can go with the parking manager to immediately inspect the car and enter the data in the auction list.  While you are shopping, your old car will be sold.  However, here, in the mall, you can buy a new one. <br><br>  The main weapon to attract customers is, of course, the site.  He is bilingual (English and Arabic). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ne/bw/ly/nebwlyfwcvf29qzq_mdgajasu70.jpeg"><br><br>  The site is fundamentally no different from the sites of other companies of the alliance, but the office service requires a more detailed description. <br><br>  So, first, a client who wants to give a car gets a ticket, but not a simple one, but an advanced one.  To do this, you need to mark your name and surname, the language of communication, as well as the make of car on the terminal.  Thus, managers segment customers - in a country where there are more premium cars per capita than anywhere else, this is important. <br><br>  Further, in the waiting area, you need to fill in several fields on another terminal.  This will allow more accurate and faster to evaluate the car.  Then the company inspector begins to inspect and enter the car in the database - everything is like ours.  After the auction sheet is fully formed, the machine is put up for auction, as a result of which the final price is formed. <br><br>  The whole cycle of selling the car in a minute and a half video below: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Tb-CTDw11lY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  SellAnyCar has an unusual employee with a position called Skype Closer.  He himself is in the central office, but he works remotely at several car purchase points at once.  Skype Closer is a true Arabian merchant from Thousand and One Nights, fluent in both Arabic and English.  His task is to argue the price offered and convince the client to sell the car, making it so that the client is satisfied.  The effectiveness of Skype Closer is quite high - out of 10 car owners, four after talking with him are selling the car.  The scheme of work through Skype makes it possible to more efficiently use a qualified negotiator who is difficult to find in the labor market of any country, including the UAE. <br><br>  On the one hand, if you look at the card, SellAnyCar has nowhere to grow.  The existing 19 points of sale are quite enough to fully cover the Emirates, and there is no need to expand further, there is only one desert around.  But the management of the company is not embarrassed - in the Gulf there are states that are close in terms of life to the Emirates.  Perhaps as an experiment, the branches of SellAnyCar will appear there in the near future. <br><br>  In conclusion, we offer you a short video - a Russian-language interview with Oscar Hartmann, co-founder of CarPrice, with CEO SellAnyCar Saygin Yalchin: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WZo9ZVMPJpA" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/351500/">https://habr.com/ru/post/351500/</a></p>
