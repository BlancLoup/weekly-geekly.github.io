In Russia, the number of electric cars in the tens, but continues to grow every year.  <a href="https://www.autostat.ru/news/31266/">According to the</a> agency "AUTOSTAT", in 2017 in the Russian Federation 39 electric machines were sold.  The demand, albeit slowly, is growing (for comparison: in 2016, 33 units were sold).

      We propose to consider in detail how much they cost and what technical characteristics of <a href="https://ccsummit.ru/ru%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_campaign%3D23-10">electric cars</a> acquired by Russians in 2017 have. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>The most popular electric cars in Russia</b> <br><br>  <i>Prices for electric cars Tesla and Renault are taken from the catalogs of the official Russian sites of companies.</i>  <i>On Nissan and Mitsubishi - medium in the European market, since officially these cars are not sold in the territory of the Russian Federation.</i> <br><br>  The most popular electric cars Tesla: Model S and Model X. Of the total number of vehicles sold these models - 27 pieces. <br><br>  <b>Tesla Model S</b> is a sedan that has a top speed of 250 km / h, accelerates to 100 km / h in 2.5 seconds and has an engine capacity of 762 liters.  with.  Charged battery with enough more than 600 km.  The price for the Model S is $ 140000‚Äì260000. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/ed/f8/59edf87ff3273164224884.jpeg"><br><br>  <b>Tesla Model X</b> is a hatchback designed for the whole family.  Specifications are similar to the Model S: the same 762 liters.  with., the same maximum speed of 250 km / h.  Power reserve is less: the battery will last for 400‚Äì540 km.  It costs Model X $ 120,000‚Äì260,000. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/ed/f8/59edf8807953a484772278.jpeg"><br><br>  Also for 2017 in Russia, 8 <b>Nissan Leaf</b> electric <b>cars</b> were sold.  Technical characteristics of the machine are as follows: 108 l.  with., acceleration to 100 km / h in 10 s, maximum speed - 150 km / h, and the range without recharging is 170 km.  It looks more modest compared to Ilona Mask electric cars, but the price is several times lower: Leaf can be bought for $ 10,000‚Äì18,000. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/ed/f8/59edf87fa4199492397216.jpeg"><br><br>  Only 3 <b>Renault Twizy</b> found their owners in Russia for 2017.  The two-seater electric car, only 2 meters long, is endowed with an engine of only 11 horsepower, accelerates to 45 km / h in 6 seconds, the maximum speed is only 80 km / h, and the cruising range is 100 km.  With such technical specifications, the Twizy price is $ 14,000, which may have been the reason for such inexpressive sales - for the same money you can buy the previous Nissan Leaf with more serious technical indicators. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/ed/f8/59edf87fc3dbc868540234.jpeg"><br><br>  In the last place is the <b>Mitsubishi i-MiEV</b> - 1 copy sold in Russia.  The electric car accelerates to 100 km / h in 10 seconds, has a maximum speed of 130 km / h, and a fully charged battery is enough for a 120 km trip.  The price of i-MiEV ranges from 8,000 to 10,000 US dollars. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/ed/f8/59edf87f56481247498662.gif"><br><br><br><table><thead><tr><th>  Name </th><th>  Sales, pcs </th><th>  Cost, $ </th><th>  Max.  speed </th><th>  Power reserve </th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>  Tesla Model S </td><td rowspan="2">  27 <br>  (Model S and Model X) </td><td>  140.000 - 260.000 </td><td>  250 km / h </td><td>  &gt; 600 km </td></tr><tr><td>  Tesla Model X </td><td>  120.000 - 260.000 </td><td>  250 km / h </td><td>  400 - 540 km </td></tr><tr><td>  Nissan leaf </td><td>  eight </td><td>  10,000 - 18,000 </td><td>  150 km / h </td><td>  170 km </td></tr><tr><td>  Renault Twizy </td><td>  3 </td><td>  14.000 </td><td>  80 km / h </td><td>  100 km </td></tr><tr><td>  Mitsubishi i-MeEV </td><td>  one </td><td>  8.000 - 10.000 </td><td>  130 km / h </td><td>  120 km </td></tr></tbody></table><br><blockquote>  25 of 39 electric machines were purchased in Moscow and the Moscow Region, 6 in Primorsky and Khabarovsk Territories (4 and 2 pieces, respectively), 2 in Krasnodar and one each in St. Petersburg, Tatarstan, Irkutsk, Voronezh, Ryazan and Rostov regions. </blockquote><br>  <b>Where to charge electric vehicles in Russia?</b> <br><br>  Most electric stations in Russia, of course, in Moscow - a total of 39 stations.  The leader in the number of charges is Mosenergo PJSC - 13 pieces.  8 units each - from PJSC ROSSETI and Emi, 3 stations each have MOSOBLENERGO and Tesla Wall Connector, 2 are located in the MOSCOW TESLA CLUB salons, one is Electrositi LLC and another one is in Skolkovo "(High-speed charging station Tesla Supercharge). <br><br>  In St. Petersburg, the number of stations for charging electric vehicles is somewhat less - only 13, all of which are provided by <a href="http://ev-time.ru/ru/">EV-Time</a> . <br><br>  For comparison, in the US, the number of electric stations <a href="https://electrek.co/2017/06/19/us-electric-vehicle-charging-stations/">reaches</a> 16,000, and the total number of electric vehicles worldwide has <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Trends/Earth-now-has-more-than-2-million-electric-cars">exceeded</a> 2 million. A full map of electric stations is available at <a href="https://www.plugshare.com/">plugshare.com</a> . <br><br>  The International Energy Agency <a href="https://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/GlobalEVOutlook2017.pdf">reports</a> that by the end of 2017, the number of electric cars sold will be about 1.2 million, and next year - 1.6 million. <br><br>  The IEA also adds that half of its sales will be in China.  In second place will be the United States and Europe. <br><br>  At the moment, China is the real leader of the electric transport market - only last year more than 40% of the electric vehicles sold accounted for the Middle Kingdom.  And recently <a href="https://frontnews.eu/news/ru/13056">it became known</a> that the country is planning to ban the sale of gasoline cars. <br><br>  Obviously, Russia is far behind the west in the number of acquired electric vehicles.  This is understandable: given the more or less developed infrastructure only in Moscow and St. Petersburg, buying an electric car in the Russian Federation is not particularly profitable. <br><br>  However, electric cars are becoming more popular, and the trend of growth in their sales (albeit very slow) is likely to continue in the next year. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/373925/">https://habr.com/ru/post/373925/</a></p>
