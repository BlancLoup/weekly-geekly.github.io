Servers, computers, printers and faxes at some point begin to fill all the free space of technical equipment, are literally lying under your feet in the office corridors and are already preventing work.  At the museum of old technology, this good does not draw, but it will no longer be used in the company. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/36d/353/753/36d35375350acbb69b8c593d545f9070.jpg" alt="image">

      It is a pity to throw it away, especially if it is a working technique, simply obsolete.  Plus, according to the law, <b>it is impossible to simply take and throw away equipment</b> that is on the balance sheet of an enterprise.  Pieces of iron cannot simply disappear from the organization without documentary evidence.  Everything must be written off and officially disposed of. <br><br>  Last year I realized that almost a ton of old iron had accumulated on the racks in the technicals.  The time has come to seriously work through the issue and find out what can be done with this good on the one hand, according to the law, and on the other, humanly and at minimal cost. <br><br>  And that's what came out of it. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  1. Disposal </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/88e/053/ab1/88e053ab11ea042ed228054b1036dc8a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Disposal is the most popular way to get rid of old pieces of iron officially.  The method is not free.  It is necessary to lay out on average about 10,000 rubles to a special office, which has the appropriate licenses for such activities.  In theory, these guys know what to do with equipment, they can extract valuable metals from boards and process the rest in a way that is safe for nature.  How things really are is not known, but I would like to hope that the glands are really recycled, and not dumped in a heap at a dump. <br><br>  The price list for recycling is "by weight" and "by the piece."  In the first case, you simply pay for the disposal of one or more tons of equipment, and in the second you will be charged a fixed fee for each monitor or system unit (100-300 rubles per item).  Anyway, in all companies there is a minimum order amount, below which they simply won't talk to you. <br><br>  The minimum that I found is the utilization for 2500 rubles, but without taking into account the loading, delivery of equipment and the necessary expertise.  Rather, it is an option for conscious individuals who want to do the right thing, but do not need documents for accounting. <br><br>  In order for everything to be legal and correct, the utilizer must have the appropriate licenses and certificates.  The list can be viewed, for example, <a href="http://pravoved.ru/question/21982/">here</a> .  Be sure to request a certified copy of the license, otherwise the accounting department will not forgive you for this. <br><br><h5>  Advantages of this method: </h5><br>  + Lightheartedness.  You enter into a contract, pay money, and do all the work for you: take out the equipment, disassemble it, sort it and recycle it; <br>  + Environmental friendliness.  Disposal saves the environment from harmful components.  Valuable materials are recycled, and the rest is recycled. <br><br><h5>  Minuses: </h5><br>  - Real expenses.  In Moscow, the minimum export of pieces of iron costs about 10,000 rubles.  Those.  on the one hand, you lose your old friends, who while away the years of work with you, and on the other, pay money for it. <br>  - Coordination.  Recycling costs will definitely have to be coordinated with management.  Is there anyone here willing to spend the precious IT budget for recycling old iron? <br><br><h4>  2. Selling </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/12d/86f/9e0/12d86f9e08964025bca8e73445c6e657.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The second option is to sell. <br><br>  Quality expensive branded equipment, such as switches or servers, can be sold to companies specializing in used hardware, or you can try to find the end customer yourself. <br><br>  Moreover, you can sell the old iron is not entirely, but in parts.  Old memory chips, processors and motherboards of certain models can cost money even in the secondary market.  Avito and ebay to help you. <br><br>  When I considered this option, I found that it is not that easy to officially sell even fully working equipment in the collection.  If you sell to a legal entity, on the one hand, you will need to tinker with the contracts, and on the other hand, give the buyer some guarantee that the glands will work for at least six months.  Needless to say, there are great risks for both the buyer and you.  At the same time, the cost of the glands is not so high that it can be done seriously.  If you sell, then all in a crowd and at a big discount, to tense up once and forget it all like a bad dream. <br><br>  With the sale to individuals easier.  Less paper, less liabilities.  But how do they sell the glands officially?  We, for example, do not even have a cash desk to accept cash from an individual.  Ask to transfer money through Sberbank by bank transfer? <br><br><h5>  pros </h5><br>  + Live money.  This is the influx of money into the company, albeit small.  If you agree, you can even use the proceeds to upgrade the existing server fleet. <br><br><h5>  Minuses </h5><br>  - Guarantees to the buyer.  By bank transfer for jur.  It will be difficult for people to make such a sale: you need to make a contract, provide the buyer with guarantees that the equipment will work, and so on <br>  - Cash intake.  Not all companies have a cash register for selling to individuals for cash. <br><br><h4>  3. Donation </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/39d/1ab/26c/39d1ab26c28b2e819a3c8a5811519a63.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  This is the last option.  Old working equipment <b>can be donated</b> . <br><br>  A gift is the same as a sale, but without money and warranty.  In return, you get a feeling of deep satisfaction and the ability to choose the future owner of your hardware. <br><br><h5>  pros </h5><br>  + Enlightenment.  You do a good deed for others and get +1 in karma :).  Iron, unnecessary to you, turns into the necessary - it acquires a second life. <br>  + Environmental friendliness.  The world is becoming cleaner due to the fact that the equipment did not fall into a landfill. <br>  + Simplicity.  Free and with a minimum of effort. <br><br><h5>  Minuses </h5><br>  - you can donate "for free" only to individuals; <br>  - there is a maximum threshold of the assessed value at which you can do without paying personal income tax (13% for Russian citizens). <br><br><h4>  I chose option number 3 </h4><br>  Rusoniks is a hosting provider with a 13-year history.  Old, but we have enough working equipment.  We constantly increase the density in the racks and do not keep outdated energy-intensive and hot servers in the data center.  It is a pity to utilize working iron, to sell is too problematic, and it is simply not worth it to waste your time. <br><br>  After consulting with my colleagues, I chose the latter of all three options, since the pluses compensate for all the minuses.  At the council, we decided that we would give the old iron to those who need it for business.  We want servers to serve someone else for years.  So we got the <a href="http://orangeman.rusonyx.ru/">Orangeman community initiative</a> .  Well, afterwards, the story known to you with the distribution of servers and other hardware began to spin. <br><br>  In the process of distribution, it turned out that many enthusiasts in companies are asking the same question as I do - where to put the old iron.  Therefore, I decided to share my experience and talk about how to properly donate equipment. <br><br><h4>  How to give equipment? </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/139/1d8/91d/1391d891d504568eaf1688c63e05911d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  It is necessary to give the equipment with pleasure :) <br><br>  All the equipment distributed by Rusonix is ‚Äã‚Äãalready fully depreciated by this time and runs at zero cost.  Therefore, I do as follows: <br><br>  I give it to individuals only.  With the one who came to pick up the piece of iron, a Gift Agreement is made.  As already noted, donate anything to another entity.  There will be a lot of questions from the tax and headaches in accounting.  It's easier to make hara-kiri at once and not suffer. <br><br>  By law, the contract must reflect the market value of the transmitted equipment.  And this amount ideally should not exceed 4,000 rubles (this is the maximum amount of income per person per year, not taxable).  If the amount is more than 4,000 rubles, then your company will have to act as a tax agent and pay for the ‚ÄúDonee‚Äù NDFL (clause 28, article 217 of the Tax Code of the Russian Federation). <br><br>  The contract of donation must provide a justification of the declared value.  This is governed by art.  40 NK RF.  As a justification, I attach a printout of the current advertisement to the contract, for example, from Avito or ebau to similar used equipment. <br><br>  It is necessary to attach a scan-copy of the ‚ÄúEndowed‚Äù passport to the contract, to sign on both sides in two copies. <br>  In principle, everything is enough.  Then the equipment is transferred to the happy owner, and the signed contract with the applications in the accounting department. <br><br>  As you can see, nothing complicated.  The most difficult thing for me in this activity is to choose worthy recipients so as not to regret that iron fell into bad hands. <br><br><h4>  Now you know what to do :) </h4><br>  Recently, Rusonix arranged <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/rusonyx/blog/214537/">another free distribution of 12 working servers</a> .  Now accepting applications is in full swing and will last until March 14.  Then I will summarize, Habr will select the winners, and the servers will go to the new owners. <br><br>  !!! <br>  I am looking for enthusiasts who are ready to take part in the Orangeman initiative and transfer the equipment to those to whom it will serve for many more years.  If you have an old working iron that you have nowhere to put, write to <a href="">orangeman@rusonyx.ru</a> and we will attach it to reliable hands together! <br>  !!! <br><br>  <b>What do you do with the decommissioned equipment?</b>  <b>Share your experience!</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/215523/">https://habr.com/ru/post/215523/</a></p>
