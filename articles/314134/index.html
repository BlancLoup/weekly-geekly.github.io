  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to make a Wi-Fi network in public transport</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Last time <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/ru_mts/blog/313168/">we talked about how MTS builds public fixed Wi-Fi networks</a> for businesses with user identification: in cafes, restaurants, in business and shopping centers.  Today we will talk about how we build mobile Wi-Fi-networks - that is, networks that do not have a permanent location.  For example, Wi-Fi in public transport, which travels around the city throughout the day, taxis, and off-site business events are also a convenient option for catering services.  Our product is made in such a way that for us it does not matter which network the customer needs: mobile or fixed.  In any case, you get a full Wi-Fi zone with identification.  So, again, we give the floor to Andrey Plavich, marketing and product manager of the MTS business market. <br><br>  We can build a Wi-Fi network on any mobile transport: be it buses, trolley buses, trains, steamboats and taxis.  At the same time, the service is implemented in compliance with all legal requirements.  To summarize, the network can be described in two steps: the router communicates with the base station, and the signal passes through to our identification platform.  A more detailed diagram is shown below: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7ad/457/36b/7ad45736bdf7c17fb7b2b07867490ee0.png" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  To connect the service, we use Enterprise-level Wi-Fi routers (industrial).  They can obviously be put in dusty rooms, used in difficult temperature and vibration conditions.  Such a router is powered by 220 volts, 48 ‚Äã‚Äãand 12, so we easily integrate them into a transport with a standard 12 volt battery - now we are testing this network in St. Petersburg.  Note that the MTS equipment provides as part of the service, the client does not incur additional expenses for the purchase of equipment and does not experience difficulties with its setting - all issues are decided by MTS engineers. <br><br>  We always make our clients a personal account with all client statistics.  In the case of installing a router in public transport, you can see how many of each trolley bus (bus or minibus) were users, which users in which trolley buses and how often moved around the city, and which routes are most popular.  With such information, the client can plan various marketing activities - the analytical capabilities of the network are broad.

      The uniqueness of the mobile network lies in the fact that, in addition to transport, it is also useful for companies that organize meetings, seminars, negotiations and video conferencing outside the offices.  Of course, you can always ‚Äúdistribute‚Äù your Internet to guests as an alternative, but, firstly, the list of invitees may be too large, and secondly, you will not fulfill the requirement of the user identification law.  That is, you are not insured that the visitors of your conference will not commit any illegal action using your network.  With our Wi-Fi-network with user identification, you can remain calm, all the conditions of the legislation will be met.  Moreover, you will have on hand all the statistics on the participants (who connected to the network) and their contacts, which will be a good help in future marketing activities. <br><br>  Such a network can also be deployed at outdoor events in nature.  Placing several routers around the perimeter, we can organize a single network at several sites (at the request of the customer we have the opportunity to divide the zones - one made for guests with identification, the other for employees with a single login and password).  Although in such a network there may be restrictions on the bandwidth of base stations outside human settlements, because the signal is taken from conventional base stations - 3G or LTE, but even in the case of a weak signal - at the request of the client - we can strengthen it. <cut></cut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/314134/">https://habr.com/ru/post/314134/</a></p>
