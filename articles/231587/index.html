  <section class="page js-page"><h1>As I did not publish the application in Autodesk Apps Exchange</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Historically, I‚Äôve been a PDM administrator for Autodesk Vault for quite some time.  In addition, I regularly conduct training on the use and administration of this software. <br><br>  Due to the reasons described above, quite a few installations had to be carried out from scratch.  In previous versions (2010-2014), even for an experienced user, the task is, frankly, dreary.  As in the base configuration, the system is based on at least MS SQL Server and IIS: it is necessary to take into account and neutralize all sorts of features that may arise during installation. <br><br>  After about a tenth iteration of the installation, you can already blindly run through the settings of Windows, IIS and SQL.  Immediately mention that the use of a virtual machine was not suitable due to the fact that each time the installation had to be carried out on a new hardware, which the customer had.  So, the graphical interface is good, but the method is clearly not ours, since it is difficult to ensure proper speed, repeatability and automation. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In particular, before installation it is necessary to provide a <a href="http://help.autodesk.com/view/VAULT/2014/ENU/%3Fguid%3DGUID-CCA5719F-4BE6-4BC9-AC46-42DB83D8DB52">number of conditions</a> .  Below are those with whom I had to mess with each installation: <br><ul><li>  ASP Status Check </li><li>  Reboot check </li><li>  Disable User Access Control (UAC) </li><li>  Check IIS DotNet Interoperability </li><li>  Check Status of User Access Control </li><li>  IIS Default Port Check </li><li>  IIS Timeout Check </li><li>  File and Print Sharing Check </li></ul><br>  Here was born the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãautomating the preparation of the soil for installation with the help of a software utility administrator  PowerShell scripts did an excellent job with the task, for convenience they were stored and debugged in PowerGUI.  However, it soon became clear that the new user should: <br><ul><li>  Ensure the availability of PowerShell on the system; </li><li>  To know how to work with him. </li></ul><br>  So it was decided to hide all this ‚Äúautomation on the knee‚Äù in the C # application.  Fortunately, examples of solutions for meeting the conditions described above were searched as easily as for PowerShell.

      The interface turned out to be simple, wooden, but it suits me perfectly. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1bf/ce1/695/1bfce169590e4d1e96838191822eb4e4.jpg"><br><br>  People with strong nerves are welcome to <a href="https://github.com/miwaniza/Vault_ZippyInstaller/">GitHub</a> . <br>  Formed and sent a ‚Äúpublishing kit‚Äù for <a href="http://apps.exchange.autodesk.com/">Apps Exchange</a> .  After a week, the answer came: <br><br><blockquote>  It is not a problem. </blockquote><br><br>  So, to make a decision on considering the application was not in the competence of this manager, and he passed the application to the development team, which was engaged in the installation. <br><br>  A little later, the following message arrived: <br><br><blockquote>  We‚Äôve spent a lot of effort, I‚Äôve spent a lot of effort. issues with our app.  Provided that they looked at the following: <br><table><tbody><tr><td><br>  <strong>Application function</strong> <br></td><td><br>  <strong>Installer group response</strong> <br></td></tr><tr><td><br>  UAC state - Button shows current User Access Control (UAC) state by text and color.

It can be difficult to test all the repercussions. <br></blockquote><br><br>  In general, I realized that it wasn‚Äôt that l &amp; khan * lsya, but I‚Äôd definitely gotten almost with tips where it wasn‚Äôt necessary.  Since there was nowhere to retreat, I decided to somehow try to scoop up: <br><br><blockquote>  I foresaw their's concern.
