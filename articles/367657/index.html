  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Bitcoin mining again becomes profitable</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  A couple of years ago, in those days when the rate of virtual currency daily updated world records, any user could equip his computer with video cards, drop it into the basement, so as not to hum, and start mining bitcoins.  However, over time, many have lost faith in solo mining and mining, as such. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8ab/881/0e6/8ab8810e628e4cd1bffd9d6f9e344b58.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Nevertheless, the Bloomberg news agency, one of the main sources of financial information for professional participants in financial markets, has once again published a very encouraging forecast, this time, regarding the prospects for Bitcoin mining in the <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-01-07/the-return-of-bitcoin-mining">near future</a> .  Earlier, at the end of last year, Bloomberg called 2015th the ‚ÄúBitcoin Year‚Äù, and the year that has come, according to financial analysts, promises change, revitalization and development in the <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-01-07/the-return-of-bitcoin-mining">field of mining</a> . <br><br>  Miners use their computers to perform complex mathematical operations (with the inevitable costs of equipment and electricity) and are rewarded in bitcoins.  Some people have already become a millionaire by selling their precious resources at the peak of their value, at $ 1.137 per coin, at the end of 2013. However, the year before last, the cost of bitcoin swooped down to $ 183, after which only the most venerable players remained in the game.

      Many have chosen to join large mining pools or mining conglomerations that combine their computer capabilities in order to extract bitcoins faster and more efficiently. <br><br>  However, now there are signs that interest in mining is returning, not least due to the fact that the cost of Bitcoin has doubled in comparison with September of the past year.  If this is not the only factor affecting the profitability of mining, it is undoubtedly one of the most fundamental. <br><br>  ‚ÄúWhen the price rises, the belief in mining is revived, and mining equipment manufacturers rush to develop miners of the next generation,‚Äù said Bobby Lee, head of one of the largest Chinese bitcoin exchanges BTCC, whose head office is located in Shanghai. that have already acquired mining equipment - their income will increase. ‚Äù  Recall that in addition to the exchange, BTCC is the second largest mining pool in the world. <br><br>  Other pools, however, are also experiencing a boom, and, if the positive trend continues, there is reason to expect a tripling of profits, said Genesis Mining Executive Director Marco Streng.  The owners of the mining pool Genesis Mining, in which more than 130,000 miners participate, are very optimistic. <br><br>  However, optimistic moods in this period are peculiar not only to large whales.  With the release of the latest generation of powerful and energy efficient ASIC miners, which are now available to ordinary users, not just large companies and data centers, and due to the appreciation of Bitcoin, solo mining cryptocurrency is once again becoming profitable, as equipment manufacturers say.  However, as a result of the appreciation, the complexity of Bitcoin began to grow at a significant pace.  Over the past 2 months, network complexity has increased by almost 50%.  And, apparently, the growth will continue further, as long as the price of Bitcoin rises. <br><br>  Nevertheless, it is impossible to lose sight of the future reduction of the miner's remuneration for each block found exactly twice.  In the summer of 2016, four years will have expired since the last decline, and the reward for the found block will be 12.5 BTC, instead of 25. <br><br>  ‚ÄúGet as much now as possible,‚Äù advises Bobby Lee, CEO of BTCChina.  In his opinion, with a decrease in the reward and production rates, the price of cryptocurrency will rise.  The current situation in the Chinese financial markets also has a significant effect on the increase in bitcoin. <br><br>  Mining is still a risky and nervous exercise, warns Olga Cardiff, the author of an article in Bloomberg.  It is not surprising that panicky moods have been walking around the net lately, due to the upcoming changes.  However, at the moment, mining is still evolving, the network is growing, large pools are doubling their capacity (such as BTCC), and customers expect the delivery of their latest generation of powerful and energy-efficient miners. <br><br>  "In our pool, everyone earns," says Bobby Lee, "If it were not profitable, no one would connect their computer to the network." <br><br>  <i>Enough to soar in the clouds, start mine in the clouds</i> - <a href="https://hashflare.io/%3Flang%3Drus%26utm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3D269510">says Hashflare</a> . <br><br> <a href="https://hashflare.io/%3Flang%3Drus%26utm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3D269510"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/eb1/57f/5f9/eb157f5f90f54032aa2b80b1c2973a73.png" alt="image"></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/367657/">https://habr.com/ru/post/367657/</a></p>
