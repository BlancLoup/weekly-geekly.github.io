  <section class="page js-page"><h1>DUMP Kazan 2019 - Tatarstan Developers Conference. We accept applications for reports</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Last year we made a trial attempt to bring IT specialists of different specialties and different companies of Kazan together, and it turned out pretty well.  In 4 sections: Backend, Frontend, Design and Management came 219 participants.  It would seem a little if not for two ‚Äúbuts‚Äù: <br><br><ol><li>  There were 154 participants at the first DUMP Yekaterinburg, and 1608 at the DUMP 2019. </li><li>  The organizers of IT-meetings and conferences in Kazan said that people go to them reluctantly, even for free, and it is unlikely that they will be able to gather more than 100 people in 1.5 months. </li></ol><br>  In general, the beginning has been made, and we announce the <a href="https://dump-kazan.ru/">collection of applications</a> for reports at DUMP Kazan 2019. The conference will be held in the conference rooms of the Riviera Hotel on November 8. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/3f/1-/7y/3f1-7yr-nibo4ekq-4ldbgkmaru.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  This year there will also be 4 sections, but their composition has changed: Backend, Frontend, DevOps and Management, and the sections will be full-time - 8 reports each.

      Also added round tables and workshops.  At first, we discuss hot problems and burning tasks, and at second, we study a specific technology or technique in practice. <br><br>  The best IT people in Kazan gathered in the program committee, who seriously intend to make DUMP content ‚Äúbombing,‚Äù and Kazan the IT capital of the Russian Federation.  Well, do it? <br><br>  See section concepts below and apply for speeches.  Applications are open until September 8, but the advantage is for those who apply earlier, simply because the slots may already be occupied later. <br><br><h2>  Backend </h2><br>  In this section, we talk about server development without reference to programming languages.  We will discuss technologies and development methods that just appeared in 2018-2019, and look for the optimal solution to the problems that most backend developers face. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/lh/rn/zg/lhrnzgk_oa6ktfsmg_1rnrxz4v4.jpeg"><br><br>  We are awaiting reports on the following topics: <br><br><ul><li>  Microservices </li><li>  High load </li><li>  Compiler Optimization </li><li>  Application performance </li><li>  Architecture in terms of code organization, business logic </li><li>  Best practices on various topics </li><li>  Functional programming </li><li>  Microservice testing </li><li>  Distributed System Infrastructure </li><li>  Blockchain </li><li>  ML / ML on microservices </li><li>  The train of thought of cool developers and architects in the process of developing a large system </li><li>  DDD </li><li>  Work with iron </li><li>  Authorization and Authentication </li><li>  Garbage collection, working with memory </li><li>  Technical debt, Code Review and refactoring: technologies, techniques and results </li></ul><br>  The level of training of the participants DUMP middle and middle +, it is worth considering this when selecting topics for the application of the report.  We would really like the audience not to get bored. <br><br>  The presentation has 35 minutes + 5 minutes for questions in the hall.  After the report there will be another 20 minutes for discussion on the sidelines. <br><br><h3>  Section Program Committee: </h3><br>  <b>Yuri Kerbitskov</b> is a technical backend at Ak Bars Digital Technologies. <br>  About me: ‚ÄúSince I am organizing .NET KznDotNet meetings, the topic of community development is close to me and pleasing to the eye, and I am glad to make efforts to make more IT movement in Kazan.‚Äù <br><br>  <b>Andrey Zharinov</b> is the head of the Yandex development office in Yekaterinburg. <br>  About me: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm in charge of some of the alarm services, the backend and DUMP are close to me, and this made me go to the program committee.‚Äù <br><br><h2>  Frontend </h2><br>  Responsible for developing the client side of the site / application?  That way. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/hn/e5/8p/hne58psbr2t_8r39tqocibkfnxi.jpeg"><br><br>  Leave applications here if you have something to tell on any topic from the list below: <br><br><ul><li>  Microservice Web Applications </li><li>  DSL testing, e2e testing, Selenium / Puppeteer, BDD </li><li>  JS alternatives: Typescript, ClojureScript, Elm, Dart </li><li>  Security: hacking and protection, vulnerabilities in npm </li><li>  Methodologies, architecture and principles: SOLID, microservices, BEM </li><li>  Functional programming in front-end development </li><li>  Front assembly for different devices </li><li>  Real time web apps </li><li>  api gateway </li><li>  Flutter for web </li><li>  Client Application Architecture </li><li>  Offline client application availability </li><li>  Using gRPC in a browser and comparing with other protocols </li><li>  Client data synchronization and storage: REST, GraphQL, Web Sockets </li><li>  Writing and maintaining your ui components </li><li>  Company level mono repositories </li><li>  Automation Release Management </li><li>  Using new browser api (for example, fingerprint authorization or authorization through a mobile operator) </li><li>  Stories: successes and failures, interaction with business </li><li>  Other: Web API, the future of standards, open source, package managers, etc. </li></ul><br>  Uff, overclocked!  In fact, the list is not exhaustive, there is something interesting - <a href="https://dump-kazan.ru/frontend">write an application</a> .  When preparing, count on middle + level participants, build a presentation on practical examples, and feel free to talk about the rake and failures.  Perhaps this will save someone hours and days of work. <br><br>  The presentation has 35 minutes + 5 minutes for questions in the hall.  After the report there will be another 20 minutes for discussion on the sidelines. <br><br><h3>  Section Program Committee: </h3><br>  <b>Alexander Iossa</b> - Head of Frontend Development at Diginavis. <br>  He says about himself: ‚ÄúI like to set the frontend development vector and software engineering in general.  That is, it‚Äôs important for me that the report at the conference prompts people to write better, think more, not use some things, simply because it‚Äôs fashionable. ‚Äù <br><br>  ‚ÄúI'm <b>Roman Gafiatullin</b> , I lead one of the product teams at ClickClickDrive.  In general, I‚Äôm for any movement, I‚Äôm trying to introduce developers to the engineering culture. ‚Äù <br><br>  <b>Ramil Zakirov</b> is a senior interface developer at Diginavis.  Has been developing applications since 2010.  He likes to practice functional programming and communicate with followers on related topics.  He is an evangelist of GraphQL and recommends using this technology in web development. <br><br>  The program of the section is also helped by <b>Igor Zinoviev</b> , the founder of KazanJS (regular meetings of JS developers, as well as the Telegram channel of the same name). <br><br><h2>  Devops </h2><br>  In this section, we talk about DevOps culture, engineering solutions, and how to establish interaction between the development team and the operation team. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/1w/v3/qr/1wv3qrlywmhdoifup1bxhbi6wky.jpeg"><br><br>  As one of the program directors, Konstantin Makarychev, said: <blockquote>  Devops (person) is an automation evangelist, not a sysadmin with a big salary, and this is worth starting.  That is, if someone somehow automated, without having the coveted ‚Äúdevops‚Äù in the title of the post, while directly related to the development, this is our person.  And what (deployment, code writing, QA, interaction with teams), and how - it doesn‚Äôt matter at all, these are just implementation details. </blockquote>  So, if you are such a devoop and do not mind sharing your experience, rather leave a request for a performance <a href="https://dump-kazan.ru/devops">here</a> <br><br>  Now, in fact, to the topics. <br><br>  Conceptually, devobs themes can be divided into two parts: technical and about processes. <br>  From the first we are waiting for reports about: <br><br><ul><li>  Kubernetes, Istio, service mesh, dockers, CI / CD </li><li>  Cloud transformation: how everything used to be old and bad and how now everything is new and good </li><li>  Continuous Delivery / Continuous Integration </li><li>  Cloud technologies: AWS, Azure, OpenStack, Serverless, etc. </li><li>  Which cloud to choose?  Cloud Services Comparison </li><li>  Containerization and Orchestration </li><li>  Application Monitoring and Auditing (OkMeter, DataDog, BPF, XRebel, OpenTrace, etc.) </li></ul><br>  Of the second, DUMP participants would like to listen to reports on: <br><br><ul><li>  The experience of implementing DevOps in a team: successes, failures, lost illusions </li><li>  New Approaches and Tools in Configuration Management </li><li>  Complexity management and how to repay technical debt </li><li>  Real-life examples of projects that have implemented devops: failed and successful practices and lessons learned </li></ul><br>  The presentation has 35 minutes + 5 minutes for questions in the hall.  After the report there will be another 20 minutes for discussion on the sidelines. <br><br><h3>  Section Program Committee: </h3><br>  <b>Konstantin Makarychev</b> - developer of Provectus, Hydrosphere.io, founder and organizer of Expert Fridays. <br><br>  About me: ‚ÄúI just do what I need and write on what I have to do‚Äù. <br><br>  <b>Radik Fattakhov</b> - Team Leader in ClickClickDrive. <br>  About me: ‚ÄúThe backend is a front-end developer.  I automate everything that is possible for the team to work efficiently.  I‚Äôm glad to help organize a good conference in Kazan, where people from all over the region would share their experiences. ‚Äù <br><br>  <b>Mikhail Tsykarev</b> is a senior team leader in the project and strategic management office of ICL-Services. <br>  About me: ‚ÄúAt the same time, I lead the creation of the company's internal product in the role of Product Owner.  I am also a tracker of the it-incubator of the innovation infrastructure of UrFU.  In part of the projects that I oversee, DevOps practices are actively used. ‚Äù <br><br><h2>  Management </h2><br>  This section was created for team leaders, department heads and development managers, project managers and service stations.  Here we get to know each other, submit issues for discussion and share the solutions found.  Because "one head is good, and 200 is better." <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/bj/05/h6/bj05h68wv9ls3ffhgi3yteomyf0.png"><br><br>  In order not to pile all the topics together, the program is divided into 2 blocks: ‚ÄúTeam Management‚Äù and ‚ÄúProject Management‚Äù. <br><br>  In the ‚ÄúTeam Management‚Äù block, we are waiting for an application on the topics: <br><br><ul><li>  Team building and internal relations: team organization schemes, role models, communications (facilitation of meetings, for example), etc. </li><li>  Personal work with an employee: individual development plans, motivation, feedback </li><li>  Distributed Team Management </li><li>  Team Performance Metrics </li><li> Leader / team lead development: where to grow further, how to stay necessary, engineering chauvinism and professional burnout </li><li>  Round table ‚ÄúPersonnel hunger: where to get developers?‚Äù </li></ul><br><br>  In the block ‚ÄúProject Management‚Äù we are looking for speakers who will share their experience on the following topics: <br><br><ul><li>  Processes, planning, management: planning and assessment of tasks, unification of processes, micromanagement, work with risks, retrospectives </li><li>  Interaction with stakeholders: customers, management, related departments </li><li>  Engineering culture in the company / project </li></ul><br>  All speeches of the same duration: 35 minutes to expand on the topic + 5 minutes for questions from the audience.  After each report there will be 20 minutes for the participants to communicate with the speakers. <br><br><h3>  Section Program Committee: </h3><br>  <b>Igor Katykov</b> is the director of Tinkoff.ru development centers in Kazan and Innopolis. <br>  17 years in IT, last 13 - in management.  Three times he created successful teams of up to 90 people. <br><br>  About what prompted me to work in the program committee: ‚ÄúI want Kazan to become the third IT capital after Moscow and St. Petersburg.  In order for Kazan (and its environs) to develop a powerful IT-force that can win the competition against Ekaterinburg, Novosibirsk, Nizhny and other millionaires.  Without a powerful local community, sharing experiences will not work. ‚Äù <br><br>  <b>Alexander Kiverin</b> - Technical Director of Ak Bars Digital Technologies (Ak Bars Bank). <br>  About me: ‚ÄúThroughout my ten-year activity in the field of development management I have not ceased to explore new approaches in the management of projects and development teams.  At the DUMP 2019 conference, I‚Äôm sure we will hear cool reports on the proper organization of processes, proper people management and building effective teams, so that we can apply this experience to even more cool projects that give good results! ‚Äù <br><br>  <b>Igor Zilberg</b> is the director of SmartHead. <br>  Purpose: ‚ÄúTo make the world a better place through quality and informed project management, design and systems management (in the broad sense, not only IT).  To make more people for whom project management is a profession, and not "go to softskills."  So that groups of people are led by leaders, rather than ‚Äúheroes‚Äù placed in leadership positions.  So that the applied management methodologies are appropriate, not trendy.  So that as a result of all this, more projects are successful and more people who create them are happier. ‚Äù <br><br>  <b>Elena Lukyanicheva</b> - project manager at EPAM. <br>  About me: ‚ÄúI am an IT project manager.  Interesting projects (with a non-standard subject area, solving non-standard tasks) and complex (containing a large number of components, libraries, technologies, with complex integration).  The projects that I do with enthusiastic people from all over the world.  People changing the world for the better, making it more convenient and safe.  And I want more such projects and people in Kazan. ‚Äù <br><br><h2>  Deadline, application selection and presentation preparation </h2><br>  Geography: we are waiting for speakers from all over the country, near abroad, and far too. <br><br>  Deadline: submit applications by September 8th.  The program committee will review them within 7 days, and the admin section will contact you. <br><br>  Preparation of the speech includes several stages: <br><br><ul><li>  Request </li><li>  Phoning with the program committee (10-15 minutes), where the speaker briefly talks about the topic </li><li>  Run (rehearsal of the report with slides or their drafts) </li><li>  Perhaps 2nd and 3rd runs </li><li>  Presentation preparation </li></ul><br>  Leave applications on the <a href="https://dump-kazan.ru/">site</a> and come to speak in Kazan.  DUMP will be held on Friday, and for the weekend you can stay for a walk in Kazan.  It is definitely good both in summer and in winter - we checked. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/460879/">https://habr.com/ru/post/460879/</a></p>
