Sales of Moto smartphones in Russia will begin very soon - until March 1, it <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/lenovo/blog/270992/">remains to suffer</a> only a few days.  And to wait was a little more fun, we offer you our review of the flagship of the line - Moto X Force.  This is a wonderful smartphone with excellent autonomy and unbreakable screen, which is made using ShatterShield's unique technology.  Interesting?  Then go under the cut! <br><br> <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/lenovo/blog/271668/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ffb/123/6e8/ffb1236e81ff486cb563ec76649dee3a.jpg"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  <font color="#d8291e">Recognizable and memorable</font> </h2><br>  The design of Moto X Force is strict but memorable.  The whole secret is in a solid and slightly curved aluminum base and an unusual nylon insert with a beautiful texture on the back of the case.  Well, and perhaps the oval panel with the Moto logo, which you will find on each model of the line.  From March 1, only one version of X Force will be sold in Russia - exactly the one that you will see in the photos in this material.  But, we do not exclude the possibility of the appearance of other modifications in the future. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/345/eef/d96/345eefd966f840fabc4ec1897d1d4a15.jpg">

      <br>
      Headphone jack and sliding slot for nanoSIM and microSD are located on the top panel.  The power and volume buttons are on the right side. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bf3/760/48f/bf376048fc97458498864d0ade69260c.jpg"><br><br>  The usual microUSB for charging is on the bottom of the smartphone.  Experiments with USB Type C are being postponed for the future.  This, however, did not prevent the implementation of the fast charging function, but about it a bit later. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/27f/ce4/802/27fce4802e4a42beaf3c5823452aafd9.jpg"><br><br><h2>  <font color="#d8291e">Asphalt screen</font> </h2><br>  The main feature of Moto X Force is a very, very, very, very durable screen.  It is made using ShatterShield technology and is such a clever high-tech sandwich.  On the first floor there is an aluminum substrate, a little higher a bendable pOLED matrix, an even higher double sensor layer and at the very top two protective panels.  All this is necessary to ensure that the safety of the screen could not worry, even if the device crashes down on the asphalt from a height of human growth. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/634/7c4/d45/6347c4d458824a7496b05e487bf99acb.jpg"><br><br>  But trying to do it on purpose is still not worth it.  We would do it with great pleasure to make a completely unkillable smartphone, but here either the beauty, or the inconvenience of exorbitant thickness and powerful rubber inserts.  But the engineers had to make a beautiful smartphone with a durable screen for a wide audience.  According to our internal surveys, approximately every second user in the world ever broke the screen of his smartphone, so we focused on this element. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/992/9b7/09b/9929b709bea7469d95fba3e32936073f.jpg"><br><br>  So the metal frame from impacts can be deformed, and it is better not to expose the internal modules once again.  Also, do not put the gadget in one pocket with keys and small change.  It will not stop working from this, but the outer gloss will quickly lose. <br><br>  By the way, all these protective tricks did not affect the image quality.  In this regard, Moto X Force is not inferior to other flagships.  The resolution of a 5.5-inch pOLED screen is an impressive 2560x1440 pixels, which gives a density of 540 dots per inch.  The matrix type automatically guarantees excellent black depth, high contrast and wide viewing angles.  There is no air gap between the protective panels, so the picture on the Moto X Force display is perfectly readable in the street under the bright sun. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f36/d51/7da/f36d517dac04438db7f844fc309673db.jpg"><br><br>  Another interesting thing is the support of the Always On function.  Notification icons, time and date are displayed on the screen even in sleep mode.  Practice shows that for many users the feature is convenient, while it almost does not affect the power consumption. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#d8291e">Ready for anything</font> </h2><br>  Moto X Force runs on the Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 chipset. It's all grown-up: support for the big.LITTLE architecture and two quartets of cores with a frequency of 1.5 and 2 GHz.  Plus integrated graphics Adreno 430 c 650 MHz.  And a decent amount of RAM, of course, is 3 gigabytes of it.  All this allows the smartphone not only to get serious results in benchmarks, but also to easily cope with any tasks set by the user, and without glitches and brakes.  Of course, the devices with Snapdragon 820, presented at the MWC 2016, are more powerful, but you are unlikely to find such a scenario that the 810 will cope with worse. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/97d/221/e2d/97d221e2dfdc45c2a3e2d6247a69306e.jpg"><br><br>  The amount of internal memory is limited to 32 GB, of which about 24 are available to the user.  This is quite enough for all the necessary programs, and photos, music and videos can be stored on a memory card. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/594/7c1/230/5947c12301a24c7eb9f243b7efcb7094.jpg"><br><br>  Moto X Force certified for Russia supports absolutely all LTE frequencies necessary in our area, but the American version of it called Droid Turbo 2 with this case is a little different - be careful.  In addition, it did not go without the built-in NFC and work in Wi-Fi networks of the standard 802.11ac, which also means support for both frequencies - both 2.4 and 5 GHz. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/46e/140/04c/46e14004cf504e47b1379026b14bf805.jpg"><br><br><h2>  <font color="#d8291e">Fresh Android</font> </h2><br><br>  X Force is the flagship of the Moto smartphone lineup, so the lack of a fresh version of the operating system is completely inconvenient for it.  "Out of the box" the user will receive the device with Android 5.1.1 on board, but immediately after connecting to the Wi-Fi network, an invitation will appear to download the coveted "six".  Similar invitations will receive buyers Moto X Style, Moto X Play, and even Moto G. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#d8291e">Flagship camera</font> </h2><br>  Android at Moto X is ‚Äúnaked‚Äù, and the ‚ÄúCamera‚Äù application interface is special.  Here we have tried to follow the path of rational simplification.  If you navigate the screen from left to right, a menu will appear with icons for changing settings and selecting shooting modes.  If you hold your finger from the right frame to the center, then this will allow you to quickly go to the gallery of captured images.  Also in the interface there are buttons to activate the front camera and instantly start recording video. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6b0/a63/8d8/6b0a638d81d54f44b61cdea8ab1dc821.jpg"><br><br>  There is no traditional shutter button; by default, the photo is taken immediately after the tap in the place where the user wants to focus.  However, there is an alternative: the ‚Äúsight‚Äù can be manually moved across the display, and instead of the shutter button, press the black field to the right.  It will appear immediately after the maximum resolution of 21 MP is selected in the settings, at which photos with a 4: 3 aspect ratio are taken. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/625/938/e2a/625938e2aa4646c2bbbd61c7b478f325.jpg"><br><br>  The method of focusing phase - immediately work 192 sensor.  The camera shifts very quickly to sharpness, as, however, it starts up.  A proprietary processing algorithm is applied, the task of which is to make the colors look as realistic as possible.  And even in the dark, using Moto X Force is quite comfortable to photograph.  For a full buzz, only optical image stabilization may not be enough, and we hope that in future generations the X Force will definitely appear. <br><br><table><tbody><tr><th> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/140/dcb/584/140dcb5847724c2190afa3b04715be7b.jpg" alt="image" width="400"></a> </th><th> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ce8/330/6c8/ce83306c865f467c88d86cba7ac48142.jpg" alt="image" width="400"></a> </th></tr><tr><th> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/714/829/0cb/7148290cbacc412aa322b37062b2fd72.jpg" alt="image" width="400"></a> </th><th><a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f8f/ad6/490/f8fad64908a54952b8a4c76b27586506.jpg" alt="image" width="400"></a> </th></tr><tr><th> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/227/545/c76/227545c769d24d06891509ade76fe04e.jpg" alt="image" width="400"></a> </th><th> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6fe/9ec/95c/6fe9ec95c4d54200a27549265513fd61.jpg" alt="image" width="400"></a> </th></tr><tr><th> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3eb/aad/c55/3ebaadc5508841e29ef3586342cf7d42.jpg" alt="image" width="400"></a> </th><th> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/53e/745/863/53e7458630774d81ae5154f0d1f8c57d.jpg" alt="image" width="400"></a> </th></tr><tr><th> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/709/e2f/0ca/709e2f0cac0d47d2a7f4a6833f96f00d.jpg" alt="image" width="400"></a> </th><th> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/93a/c52/b5e/93ac52b5e5b64299895a93bbce8f67f7.jpg" alt="image" width="400"></a> </th></tr></tbody></table><br><h2>  <font color="#d8291e">More day away from power outlet</font> </h2><br>  Inside the Moto X Force is hidden a powerful battery with a capacity of 3760 mAh (14.2 Wh), which can be fully charged from 0 to 100% in just 1.5 hours using the included adapter.  And up to half of the maximum battery will be charged within 30 minutes after connecting to the mains. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/64f/e6c/0da/64fe6c0dac4e46d18aae209946173f70.JPG"><br><br>  Of course, everyone uses their smartphones in different ways, but we will share the experience of employees of the Moscow office of Lenovo.  For those who use X Force as the main device, the charge is usually enough for 1.5 days.  Well, if we talk about tests with the performance of certain tasks for complete discharge, then the data are as follows.  At maximum brightness with Wi-Fi connected, the full charge of the X Force battery lasted more than 4 hours of mobile gaming.  In the case of playing Full HD video under similar conditions, the result is even more impressive - at least 12 hours. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#d8291e">Where to buy and how much?</font> </h2><br>  Together with three other smartphones of the Moto X Force line, it will go on sale in Russia exactly on March 1, 2016.  Find the devices will be in the range of our partners.  So far this is ‚ÄúEuroset‚Äù, ‚ÄúMegaphone‚Äù and ‚ÄúSvyaznoy‚Äù.  A little later, Moto gadgets will appear in our brand shop <a href="http://shop.lenovo.ru/">shop.lenovo.ru</a> .  The flagship will cost 49,990 rubles. <br><br>  If you are one of those who drop their smartphones regularly, then we highly recommend it.  The taste of X Force will also be necessary for those who want a ‚Äútop-end‚Äù device, but at the same time they don‚Äôt like to carry an external battery with them for constant charging.  The flagship of the Moto line on a full charge "lives" for really long, and in which case it can always be "fed up" up to 50% in just half an hour. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/10d/ba7/de7/10dba7de7e744394ad45dbfd0a0531ad.jpg"><br><br>  <i>That's all for today.</i>  <i>If you have any questions, we will be happy to answer them in the comments.</i>  <i>Thanks for attention!</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/391049/">https://habr.com/ru/post/391049/</a></p>
