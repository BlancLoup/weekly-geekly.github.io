  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Ordering experience in Chinese online stores</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In this article I would like to share with readers my personal experience about Chinese online stores where I (or my friends) had to make purchases.  It will be about the electronic segment of goods.  I‚Äôll go straight to the point and give reviews of these stores with a final assessment: <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  1. <a href="http://focalprice.com/">FocalPrice.com</a> is the first on my list of online stores of gadgets, electronics, accessories, etc. When I got acquainted with the ‚Äúfocal‚Äù, I was attracted by prices, for some goods they were significantly lower than on eBay (the Chinese are pushing too much on ebay our product, but we will not consider this case in the article).  As it turned out, this is due to the location of the store itself, namely, its proximity to manufacturing plants.  To pay for the order you can only use PayPal.  For myself personally, I did not order anything from them, but one friend of mine needed some kind of spare part for a camera, and he found it from them, after which he asked me to order it for him.  The company has a huge range of products (more than 100,000 items) and even sold copies of famous brands, but judging by the reviews, telephones and office equipment are of quite normal quality.  In general, I read a lot of good things about them, and besides, various promotions are often held, and there are discount coupons, which codes can be found on the Internet.  As for delivery, it is free, but, like at many Chinese stores, it can be delayed (usually the order arrives not earlier than in 2 weeks).  If you place an order in excess of $ 20, then the "focal" will link a track number to the parcel for tracking in the mail.  It remains to add that the impression of FocalPrice.com is very good, there are, of course, some unpleasant moments, but after all, everyone has them (delays, nedokomplekt, non-compliance with the characteristics, etc.).  Great store, proven by many! <br><br>  2. <a href="http://tinydeal.com/">Tinydeal.com</a> - the next in our review.  There are no significant differences from the ‚Äúfocal‚Äù, but it is worth noting that Visa and Master Card credit cards are also accepted for payment, however, I still recommend using PayPal (more reliably, and there is a $ 150 restriction on accepting cards, although earlier there were 250).  The track number is given when ordering over $ 33, and there is one nuance - if there are several items in your order, then you need to have a free tracking number for most items with a price higher than $ 33, although you can pay for it, it will be released 2 -3 $.  My first purchase at this store was a telephone, and everything went perfectly.  I was pleased with the Russian interface of the site and the online chat, where I was able to quickly get answers to my questions (in Russian).  The package goes, as elsewhere - 2-3 weeks (although there is a week, which happens rarely), but it happens that not everything is in the order and if something is missing, after contacting the support they send out the undersupply.  In general, it is very convenient to choose a product here, since  There is a detailed description, ratings and reviews, and many comments can be found in Russian.  If you are a beginner and want to try working with Tinydeal.com on small orders, then the site has a section of the 5-dollar zone.  Although the prices of goods are already acceptable, you can find discount coupons (5-7%) on the Internet, and everything else has the opportunity to earn points (write comments, reviews, etc.) for which you can buy goods, but better read on the site.  A nice bonus is that if you order more than $ 200, you are offered to choose one of several possible gifts.  The last time was either a flying UFO with a remote control, or a cube of magnetic balls. <br><br>  3. Now I want to tell, perhaps, about the most famous Chinese store in the vast Runet - this is <a href="http://dealextreme.com/">Dealextreme.com</a> .  Here I have done quite a lot of shopping - from protective films to the phone, batteries and all sorts of accessories to digital video cameras.  Why did I decide to shop here?  It's very simple - I have not heard anything bad about this market.  The main direction of the store is gadgets, and the choice is simply huge, and prices are often encouraging.  Perhaps the only drawback of this office can be considered the delivery time, which is associated with a large number of orders (you can expect more than a month).  Those.  if you need to get the goods as quickly as possible, it is better to use another store, especially for people involved in dropshipping.  A free track number is available for orders over $ 15.  In conclusion, I would like to say that Dealextreme.com is a worthy store with only one drawback - slowness.

      4. <a href="http://pandawill.com/">Pandawill.com</a> is another Chinese online store, it is no different from competitors with something special, but I noticed that there is the largest range of phones here.  My friend bought here a popular Chinese model phone H2000 and was pleased with the purchase, and the delivery was quite fast (about 10 days).  I will note that there is a Russian-language section on the site‚Äôs forum, where people communicate rapidly, and a store representative is often found on Russian-themed forums.  In general, the support here is excellent.  Moreover, this store is maximally adapted for us, there is an online chat, a forum, and the interface of the site itself with the support of Russian.  Judging by the reviews today, this is one of the leaders in purchasing people from the CIS and you can often find positive reviews.  The only thing I didn‚Äôt like was the provision of free track numbers only when ordering more than $ 50 (compared to competitors, Panda loses here).  Payment can be made through PayPal or Visa and Master Card.  I advise you to visit the sales section, there really can be found a very cheap product.  Conclusion: a great Chinese store for a Russian user, though not with the lowest prices for popular products. <br><br>  5. I'll tell you about another store where I made a purchase (due to my inexperience) and was extremely dissatisfied.  This is <a href="http://nowsupplier.com/">NowSupplier.com</a> .  I have to say that it was tempting to make a purchase the opportunity to pay through the WebMoney system (well, who would not attract such an opportunity?).  I chose their phone, paid for it, although the price was not the best, but WebMoney was there and so I decided.  After payment, the parcel arrived in 20 days, but, as it turned out, it was not the model (‚Äútrimmed‚Äù version is $ 30 cheaper) and besides the wrong color.  All attempts to somehow solve the problem were unsuccessful.  Perhaps it would have been easier through the ‚Äústick‚Äù (PayPal) - it was possible to open a dispute, but not a fact.  Later, I began to monitor the forums and it turned out that there were a lot of problems with this unfortunate store and they did not find any solutions.  And besides, in RuNet a lot of spam from representatives of this office, what the owners of the forums complain about.  In general, I really do not recommend contacting NowSupplier.com and included this store in the review in order to somehow warn potential buyers.  Remember: you only need to carefully select an online store, having carefully studied it, and I recommend using PayPal for payment. <br><br>  6. <a href="http://merimobiles.com/">Merimobiles.com</a> - online store from enterprising Americans.  Parcels come from China, although only "staff members" work in support.  I ordered them from the little things - a cover, a 3G modem and styluses.  Delivery on time like everyone else, sent by regular mail, not EMC, without tracking. <br><br>  In conclusion, I want to add that the same product can be in many stores, but at different prices.  Therefore, first examine the stores for availability and prices, and only then make an order.  If the product without reviews - be sure to check the equipment and specifications, because  not rarely send something different from what is stated in the description.  As you can see, I am personally familiar with the 6th stores and of them I can recommend everything except the last but one (NowSupplier.com).  And remember the main rule: Chinese online stores are only for those who can wait!  Enjoy the shopping! <br><br>  PS If someone has experience of ordering in any other Chinese online stores, share in the comments with a detailed description!  What was ordered, what is the time of delivery, as the quality. <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/130438/">https://habr.com/ru/post/130438/</a></p>
