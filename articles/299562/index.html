All reports were combined into six sections: Advanced Community Management, Developer section, Technical implementation, Innovation @ Jive product, External Community Engagement, Employee Engagement and Communications.  To involve the participants in the conference, a game was organized, where points were awarded for visiting each section, many participants were actively involved in the points accumulation race.  An excellent mobile application was developed that allowed participants to contact and set up meetings, form their program, and navigate in various rooms on three floors of the Conference Center at the Aria Resort Hotel.  Since there were very few participants from Russia, we feel the need to tell more about the event.

      We were mainly interested in the sections on the development of internal and external communities, as well as the main directions of development of the platform.  It should be immediately noted that most of the reports were extremely interesting and it was sometimes difficult to make a choice in favor of one of the sections.  There were also many presentations of major major clients (Cisco, Yahoo, Citibank, Toshiba) on the successful and not so much experience of using the platform to solve internal and external tasks of the company.  I liked that not all the reports were in the spirit of ‚Äúbut look at how wonderful everything is here,‚Äù but there were real numbers and difficulties in realizing the goals set.  There were many reports on how to use analytics and what additional features can be extracted from it.  For example, Royal Bank of Canada learned how to build multi-level charts to engage in Jive for each level of the hierarchy, and also to do analytics for the head of the department regarding the level of involvement (three types of users: active, participating and creating) employees of his department.  And American Airlines learned to see posts gaining a large number of views in real time and respond to them in time, which is especially important from our point of view for external communities. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  If we talk about the main directions of development of the platform, this is, first of all, a new positioning strategy for the WorkHub platform (see figure), i.e.  combining teams, companies, social networks, chat, tasks, file sharing, etc. to solve common tasks. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img width="600" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/67b/5c0/edf/67b5c0edfa10a08d5af24546f1ac742d.png" alt="image"></div><br>  And this Jive is far ahead of all other similar solutions.  Under this new positioning strategy, pricing strategy is changing, and one of the main directions of the platform development is integration with popular business applications.  The paper outlines four main areas: 1) an interactive intranet (including the Jive Chime mobile application for exchanging short messages), 2) a healthcare solution, 3) a solution for attracting customers, and 4) a solution for engaging staff. <br><br>  Let's start with a simple one - a turnkey solution based on a platform for healthcare, here Jive has proven to be a clear leader.  There is a described, developed and ready offer for health care institutions and even a Healthcare Summit was organized at the conference.  I talked with representatives of the healthcare industry (not Russian, of course) to find out how good Jive really is in their field, and they said that Jive is actually the only solution for them that allows them to organize internal exchange and accumulation of information, improve the customer service system.  In fact, the choice for them is: SharePoint, which needs to be set up for a long time and expensively without the absence of social networking features, Yammer, where there are no business processes, and the big question is whether its development will be supported by Microsoft, and Jive, which helps to solve the entire unit. before them tasks. <br><br>  The second area is staff engagement, which, as part of the Global Human Capital trends study, called Deloitte, the personnel management task, while more than 50% of business leaders answered the urgency and importance of this task (compared to 20% last year).  Jive helps to increase productivity by 28%, satisfaction by 90%, understanding of strategic goals by 85%, increases teamwork by 95%, reduces employee turnover by 23%, reduces the number of calls to support services by 17%, reduces time by 34% on the search for information.  Jive-N allows you to solve these problems thanks to recognition, analytics on user involvement, support of employees (through news channels and blogs), integration with key HR solutions. <br><br>  Another solution is attracting and engaging clients in the community, which is solved using the Jive-X platform, namely, publishing and easily finding useful content, sharing files and knowledge between employees, engaging (events, awards, special interest groups), analytical unit and integration with other systems.  Clients include the following benefits: improved interaction (91%), the exchange of necessary documents (74%), corporate news (72%), corporate intranet (63%). <br><br>  The last solution is a corporate intranet-environment of joint interaction of employees to solve the set tasks.  This solution uses both internal and external communities.  So far, a small number of customers have both Jive-N and Jive-X solutions installed, but they all point to significant benefits from bringing together a community of customers and employees.  To implement this solution, Jive offers groups and sections with clearly defined user rights, a document flow that preserves the versioned nature of documents, a convenient interface for asking questions and publishing answers, a structured search, and for cloud versions a client support unit and event management. <br><br>  In the future, we will continue the description of the sections I visited.  In general, it can be noted that the conference was remembered by lively communication, friendly atmosphere and interesting reports. <br><br>  <b>Ekaterina Buzulukova</b> <a href="http://www.facebook.com/buzulukovaev"><u>Facebook</u></a> |  <a href="http://ru.linkedin.com/in/buzulukova"><u>LinkedIn</u></a> <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/299562/">https://habr.com/ru/post/299562/</a></p>
