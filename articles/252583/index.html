  <section class="page js-page"><h1>$ 2,500 for a domain in the .SUCKS zone</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Recently, Vox Populi, the administrator of the .SUCKS domain zone, which last year provoked outrage at its plans to sell domains for $ 25,000, <a href="http://www.nic.sucks/">launched its website</a> . <br><br>  The company offers customers five types of tariffs, depending on the domain name: from 9.95 to 2499 dollars.  That is, the planned maximum price was reduced tenfold, however, and $ 2,499 per domain is very expensive. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The most expensive ($ 2,499) are premium domains that will be sold during the period of priority registration to companies registered with the Trademark Clearinghouse (ICANN trademark database).

      It is worth noting here that for Vox Populi, a premium domain is not a domain with a commonly used keyword, but a domain with a brand name registered in several domain zones.  That is, the names of such brands that their owners are likely to want to protect by registering the corresponding domain for themselves.  For example, Google.sucks is at Vox Populi in the list of premium domains. <br><br>  Another caveat - after you register a domain at the ¬´Sunrise Premium¬ª tariff, the price does not decrease, i.e.  each subsequent year will need to pay two and a half thousand for the renewal of registration. <br><br>  The next category ($ 199 +) is for those companies whose brands did not fall into the list of premium domains, as well as for those who are not registered with Trademark Clearinghouse.  The plus sign means that prices for such domains may vary depending on the name.  The price is set by the registrar, and it may be not much less than $ 2500. <br><br>  The third option ($ 199) is domain blocking - for those who are not going to create their site in the .SUCKS zone, but want their brand name not to be registered by a third party as a domain name.  $ 199 - annual fee for domain blocking.  This feature is not available during priority registration. <br><br>  The standard domain cost is $ 249.  Registration at this price will be available after the end of priority registration.  You can not participate in expensive priority registration, but in this case it is likely that the domain will be occupied by a third party. <br><br>  Finally, $ 9.95 - domains at this price are offered to consumers who are not satisfied with the quality of goods or services of a company.  The possibility of registering a cheap domain in the .SUCKS zone can be obtained by presenting a document from your lawyer confirming that you are the affected party and are acting under the law on consumer protection. <br><br>  Interestingly, according to the ICANN rules, if domains with trademark names are registered by unauthorized persons, brand owners may claim the right to own the domain within the UDRP procedure or require a suspension of the domain functioning according to the URS procedure. <br><br>  But this rule has an exception: if a domain is registered to express criticism of goods and services of the company, then the UDRP and URS procedures do not apply to it, since the consumer‚Äôs right to publicly express his opinion is protected by law.  The problem is that most of these domains have an ending ... sucks, for example companysucks.com, which many brand owners find offensive to themselves. <br><br>  Of course, if a domain in the .sucks zone will be in the parking lot, it will be redirected or just a blank page, the brand owner can rightfully demand it as part of the UDRP procedure, or even sue the domain owner. <br><br>  But in all other cases, companies are unlikely to sue a domain if it does not contain outright slander.  Therefore, they may have to think about registering a domain for 2.5 thousand dollars. <br><br>  Many have already called such a fare a real extortion, but at the same time, Vox Populi does not formally violate ICANN rules anywhere.  The public proposes to make changes to them in order to prevent overcharging of fees from certain categories of customers (in this case, brand owners). </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/252583/">https://habr.com/ru/post/252583/</a></p>
