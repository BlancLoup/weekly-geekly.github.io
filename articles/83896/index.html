  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The introduction of free software in schools</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello. <br><br>  For a long time now, our state has been trying to introduce free software into education in order to replace proprietary Windows with it.  Various worthy causes are mentioned - from the economic component to the developing one.  But as it happens in Russia, any good idea will always rest on a bad implementation. <br><br>  The introduction began remarkably: distributions that were sent to schools along with the First Aid Package simply refused to be installed.  Company distributor tried.  Full-time and distance Linux installation and administration courses were organized in order to encourage teachers to switch to Linux.  From this moment begins the most interesting.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Training and Testing </h4><br>  The training was organized remotely on the basis of a <a href="http://pspo.it.ru/">special portal</a> .  The choice offered several courses, which were compiled lectures, assignments and tests.  We will not particularly touch upon the course content, although it‚Äôs worth the definition of <i>‚ÄúBind is a complex program (the total amount of documentation in the bind-doc package is more than 1.5 MB)‚Äù</i> .  For everything everything was given for several months, after which full-time testing was conducted. <br><br>  Testing was conducted in a special audience.  Of course, even a day from "unspecified sources" test questions were known.  By the way, by the way, it would also be possible to go separately - there were practically no questions about the Linux system itself, the console or administration programs.  There were questions from the series ‚ÄúLinus Torvalds - this is ***‚Äù, ‚ÄúTo change the appearance of the desktop, where you need to go‚Äù with the answers like ‚ÄúKDE-&gt; Settings / ***‚Äù.  Particularly memorable question about KDevelop.  It was necessary to note that KDevelop can do: syntax highlighting, compilation of the project, acceleration of development time and something else.  The correct answer was only one, as the curators explained after the call to Moscow.  But this is also not particularly important, since the atmosphere was quite ‚Äúworking‚Äù - out of all those present, they independently answered human questions that way 3. We used telephones, training manuals, ready-made tests with affixed answers, neighbors.  Despite the fact that I did not read the course, as it turned out, I passed the testing.  Although my neighbor, who copied me one-on-one (checked 2 times), in the end, the test failed.  In general, the next ‚Äúfilkina literacy‚Äù turned out. <br><br><h4>  Installing software in schools </h4><br>  And so, armed with knowledge, one could begin to install Linux in schools.  But here, too, the Ministry of Education is ahead of everyone.  According to a <a href="http://pspo.it.ru/file.php/1/FAOLetter.pdf">letter from the ministry</a> (and two applications: <a href="">first</a> , <a href="">second</a> ), each computer that has free software installed must send statistics to special servers on the Internet.  To do this, it is proposed to download the rpm or deb package and install it into the system.  This package, as stated by the developers, will collect only system information.  What it will actually do is unknown, because the developers refused to ask for the source code.  And if the computer is not connected to the Internet, then it is proposed to do it by hand to the person who installed the software.  Well, in the end of the Committee on Education came another order to monitor Internet resources that students attend. <br><br><h4>  Total </h4><br>  If you want to install regular Linux at school, you need to: <br><br><ul><li>  Take courses both remotely and internally </li><li>  Independently install software on computers </li><li>  Connect all computers to the Internet </li><li>  Install third-party monitoring software with unknown functionality </li><li>  Send with an unspecified periodicity reports on the introduction somewhere there </li><li>  Provide each user with a separate login and keep track of their Internet visits. </li><li>  Before each viewing on the Internet, record the data in a granary book. </li><li>  Set content filter to block ‚Äúbad‚Äù resources </li></ul><br><br>  The question arises: <b>who needs</b> such good?  <b>Who,</b> under such conditions, will voluntarily install in his class open source software, when there is an old, kind, Windows operating system that does not require such complications? <br><br>  Thank. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/83896/">https://habr.com/ru/post/83896/</a></p>
