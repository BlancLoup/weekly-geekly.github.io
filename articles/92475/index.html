In this topic, I will try to give Khabrovtsy their own principles and their own vision of successful project management. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>1. Live an inspiring goal</b>

      When you live for a specific purpose, all active actions, one way or another, contribute to its achievement.  It's nice to know what you are doing, why, for whom and for what.  A bold, unattainable goal awakens strength and motivation.  The desire to achieve your goal is always at a high level, and this, of course, successfully affects your work. <br><br>  It is also important to find out (and help someone understand) the life goals of the participants in your project; this will help not only better understand each other, but also significantly increase the motivation and ability to work of your team, constantly reminding you of what they are working for. <br><br>  <b>2. Be "in the stream"</b> <br><br>  It is not necessary in advance to draw up a development plan for the smallest details.  Life, as a rule, makes its own adjustments to the development strategy, and if you look closely, these adjustments are always directed to the best.  Do not be afraid to change plans, but do it consciously. <br><br>  In the course of the development of my project in this principle, I was convinced more than once and decided to open up to many requests and suggestions.  Looking back now, I understand that absolutely all the adjustments were reasonable and even inalienable. <br><br>  <b>3. Learn to listen to the opinions of others consciously and objectively.</b> <br><br>  In the course of development of your project, you will hear many different points of view, collect a variety of reviews and criticism.  It is important to be able to see in this mass truly constructive reviews that will make your project in some aspects even better and more successful.  Do not give in to emotions in this matter, especially if your project is a pronounced innovation. <br><br>  Remember the fact that any innovation inevitably passes through a stage of rejection, criticism and ridicule.  Believe, first of all, yourself and yourself, and then analyze the reviews and criticism. <br><br>  <b>4. Switch sometimes to abstract thinking</b> <br><br>  As the project develops, abstract thinking should sometimes be included and all aspects of the project should be considered under it.  This will allow you to draw up a further development strategy of the project a few steps forward, and without error and most efficiently. <br><br>  To switch to this kind of thinking, once a week, completely ‚Äúmove away from work‚Äù, get out of the city or into any quiet place to watch yourself and your project from the outside.  New ideas will come themselves. <br><br>  <b>5. Allow a little ‚Äústeer‚Äù the project to other participants</b> <br><br>  You should not put yourself and your ideas above all others combined.  In practice, it turns out that someone can offer a more rational and even, I would say, an ingenious solution to any problem.  And you, as a rule, could not have expected this from the person who proposed it.  This happens because you are fully involved in the process and sometimes you can not look at some aspect of the project development from the outside. <br><br>  At the meeting, try to arrange everything so that everyone can fully express their point of view.  Communicate also 1 on 1 with each of the team, perhaps the person will tell you what he was afraid to express publicly because of the fear that his idea will not be accepted. <br><br>  In conclusion, I want to add that the <i><b>main principle</b></i> , in my opinion, is the active development of oneself as an individual and as a leader, as well as an unconditional belief in what you are working on.  If you look closely, then behind any successful project you will first of all see a bright Person. <br><br>  Outstanding achievements to you! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/92475/">https://habr.com/ru/post/92475/</a></p>
