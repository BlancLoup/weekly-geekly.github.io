Understand what he achieved, what he learned, what he taught us.</i>  <i>Let's try to draw a line from the first week of the startup life and share experiences and results.</i> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Briefly about the project </h4><br>  <a href="http://2polyglot.com/%3Futm_source%3D2polyglot%26utm_medium%3DPR%26utm_campaign%3D2">2polyglot</a> is an international specialized freelancing platform.  Why specialized?  It is focused exclusively on specialists in the language sphere, who are looking for project work online and, accordingly, on those who need the services of linguosphere specialists.  At present, the site has four areas of linguistic activity: translation, copyright, tutoring, and guide services.  The corrector option will be added very soon. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/043/99d/761/04399d7611924a7890237862a3408e07.png" alt="image"><br><br>  "Guidelines for use" is quite familiar.  The customer creates a project with an indication of the main characteristics - the category by specialization, time, price, short description.  Several artists can respond to one project at once, from which the author of the project selects the lucky one.  Or you can find a lingvolancera from the general list using filters.

It soon became apparent that each individual media, and especially a journalist, needed their own individual approach. <br><br>  <i>Lesson 1: Before writing, feel the subject and tone of the media, read several materials of the person you are going to write, understand what will be of interest to this person and only then go ahead!</i> <br><br>  Two authoritative online publications ain.ua and roem.ru wrote about the launch of our project, which could not fail to please us.  In addition to the joy, the publications helped the site get the first significant traffic and feedback from users and guests.  Hot news quickly scatter over the network, and as a result we have counted +12 publications about 2polyglot. <br>  In addition, we have formed a base with ‚Äúwarm‚Äù contacts, which will still play a role in the future. <br><br><h4>  First achievements </h4><br>  28 out of 100. This figure brought the first seven days after the launch of the beta version.  To be more detailed, the resource was visited by 3,701 unique users, of whom 1050 people expressed a desire to register and, in fact, brought it to life.  We got this result due to several areas of communication with Central Asia (in terms of traffic from higher to lower): publicity in the media, SMM on Vkontakte and Facebook, blog posts, working with commentary publications (at first glance it may seem an inappropriate point, but transitions from disqus.com showed a good result).  In more detail below. <br><br>  <i>Lesson 2: You need to communicate with Central Asia wherever you can do it.</i>  <i>There is nothing superfluous here, and a completely unexpected source of traffic can be a bonus.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5bd/4d5/74f/5bd4d574f2ea4f68ab4cf72871178ff2.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  The first "five" and "two" </h4><br>  User rating is waiting for every creator of his brainchild.  We did not become an exception and attentively tracked every comment under publications and in social networks.  The 2polyglot round honors in the beta version did not, but even the ‚Äúcouple‚Äù we accepted with gratitude, because she and the beta version to test, remove bugs, modify.  All comments are taken on a pencil and left for revision. <br><br>  <i>Lesson 3: You must be able to hear your (potential) users and even just by passing caring commentators.</i>  <i>The project is done for the user, and often he himself says what he needs.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ed8/ee9/9e2/ed8ee99e2d9d48718b2fcfcc48a9081c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  The first victories in social life </h4><br>  Of course, 2polyglot, like any project that respects itself and its users, acquired groups in Vkontakte and Facebook, where after the launch we found a very pleasant reception.  The communities that considered the project relevant to the interests of their subscribers, without our participation, published information about it.  Resonance news made us once again make sure that we are moving in the right direction that the project to be. <br><br>  <i>Lesson 4: If the news is good / well disclosed to the audience, it will be posted, read, and appreciated.</i> <br>  In addition, we worked with thematic communities in social networks, posting news about a new service for linguists, communicating with the audience through polls and content, receiving a response and such nice ‚Äúlikes‚Äù and ‚Äúreposts‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2a2/a3b/f16/2a2a3bf16b1b4637896662885c92b511.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Here we‚Äôll leave a little infographic for 7 days on social programs - what happened in 2polyglot communities, and how other communities reacted to the beta release. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b89/edb/008/b89edb008fb1464da2e6384901677334.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  First suggestions and wishes </h4><br>  Something we expected to hear in his address, something - no.  And that, and the other, as a result, heard. <br>  Proposals to add an ‚Äúpost‚Äù editor / proofreader, besides four existing ones (translator, copywriter, tutor, guide), fell from several sides at once.  As mentioned above, the position is already in development.  And then there was a proposal to add a reviewer option - thanks, let's think it over. <br><br>  In addition to quite standard comments on the placement of buttons-pictures, there were even not quite ordinary statements - from the offer to buy a domain (who suddenly need it - contact. * Information did not sound like advertising *) to ‚Äúget advice‚Äù and not launch the project at all, as "we are preparing a better project of yours." <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e8e/988/6dc/e8e9886dcc62445e9a4fdc9f2ada1fc3.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <i>Lesson 5: Always be polite and committed to your project - it is always felt and rewarded with a credit of respect for the project and a plus for reputation.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/289474/">https://habr.com/ru/post/289474/</a></p>
