      So how did you get the idea to restore it? <a name="habracut"></a><br>  One spring evening, my friend and I studied a usb network card for a couple of dollars.  And then I remembered this laptop.  And do not we make out of it ... a <i>router</i> ?  A friend, learning that I had a working laptop in my closet, but with a broken screen and, as it turned out, without a charger, offered to buy a matrix for it.  On ebay.  To which I laughed, supposedly from where to this old matrix. <br>  But a friend still forced to drive into the search modelka ... <br><br>  And, lo and behold!  One of the first in the search results is <a href="">the same laptop</a> , judging by the description of the screen in perfect condition, but some errors when loading. <br>  The power supply, RAM, drive, hard drive and battery are not included.  Lot price is $ 28.  But there is an opportunity to bargain - make offer.  It is decided, we will take.  After all, all the boys love to play designer? <br>  Made an offer of 22 dollars.  A couple of days later the seller agreed, the lot was sent.  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa router was abandoned. <br>  Also on ebay charging for 10 dollars was bought. <br><br>  A month passed, the laptop and charging arrived. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/37c10e96/1723251e/d8a819fa/baa87e98.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/e722318f/2b980941/ef03f160/15248373.jpg"><br><br>  The American was in very good condition, a couple of scratches on the lid.  The screen is fine.  When loading issued "IDE # 1 ERROR".  The keyboard lacked the "X" key. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/38c95e56/ebd559c9/ed2ceca1/4320b0d6.jpg"><br><br>  Well, it's time to move on to the operation.  The wounded laptop was already taken apart. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/e9f7b2e8/8e007138/71500be0/13b7fc9d.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/37ba92bb/5c92dbc5/9f3cfec6/4ea85f2b.jpg"><br><br>  Disassembled American. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/62420ce0/638efdc3/7dd40218/bb6a6e36.jpg"><br><br>  And here we were surprised: there was not a single speck of dust inside the American.  At all.  Even in the cooler there was no dust.  It was a shock. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/642bef42/66f89df8/3cade610/72079716.jpg"><br><br>  By the way, Toshiba all bolts are numbered, which is inconveniently convenient.  When disassembling, we used containers for each type of bolt. <br><br>  Of the differences: <br>  - There was no wheel on the touchpad of an American <br>  - The American does not have a card reader. <br>  - American OS - Windows XP pro <br><br>  The processor of this laptop is removable, but both of them were the same. <br>  It was decided to leave mate.  Russian laptop fee.  The screen, covers, touchpad, keyboard - American. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/7d5fec6f/ffd4cbcf/4f9270ec/71c02a77.jpg"><br><br>  They missed the processor with thermal paste, changed the touchpad, connected the keyboard and the new (yes!) Screen. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/021a507f/2e32d099/21822591/0252994b.jpg"><br><br>  The key is on the star!  Well, that is, the power supply in the outlet. <br>  And here we were in for a surprise - nothing appeared on the screen.  And no beeps. <br>  We checked all the connections - everything is in order.  It turned out, they forgot to stick the RAM.  But it is surprising why the laptop did not emit any signals without it. <br><br>  Well, everything starts, you can collect. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/21274e16/08bd9f28/32b19076/6e24065a.jpg"><br><br>  At that time, one more hands appeared to hold the camera - I actively joined the process :) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/1017a4de/490c7c40/7875ed56/6202e97f.jpg"><br><br>  Collected.  The letter "X" was taken from the Russian keyboard. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/e5e3b2eb/95e4bb39/5560b815/f5dfc96a.jpg"><br><br>  A hard disk was found at a local forum, a friend donated two 256mb RAM dies. <br>  Win XP Pro (ENG, OEM) was installed on the laptop.  By the way, the drive from the Russian laptop completely refused to read the discs correctly.  After inspecting the drive, it turned out that basically the disks were inserted into it smeared with sunflower oil, not otherwise.  The drive was repaired with liquid for cleaning LCD screens and a soft cloth. <br><br>  As a result, we got a great machine for internet, old toys and office work.  The battery holds for about an hour.  Wi-fi is now via usb, but I will soon order a mini PCI module. <br>  Appearance is great - not ashamed to give. <br><br>  By the way, the first thing I put on the laptop is the first starcraft and diablo II.  I wanted to remember the past.  After all, on modern full hd screens you cannot play full screen games, and this laptop has a resolution of 1024x768. <br><br>  <b>Expenses:</b> <br>  1. Notebook - $ 22. <br>  2. Charging - 10 dollars. <br>  3. Shipping to the Russian Federation - $ 40. <br>  4. Hard disk - 300r. <br>  5. European power cable for power supply - 140r. <br>  Total, about 2600r. <br><br>  The pleasure from the process is priceless. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/92ea8640/e68e067c/7691414a/bf352f34.jpg"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/119327/">https://habr.com/ru/post/119327/</a></p>
