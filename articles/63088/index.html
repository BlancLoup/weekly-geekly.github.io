      <i>So, the history of the System Shock Universe begins in 1994, when the little-known (at that time) office of Looking Glass Studios published System Shock (1), which turned all ideas in general and the notion of ‚Äúshooter‚Äù in particular, against the background of ‚Äúrattling‚Äù at that time the popularity of the bloody shooter Doom.</i>  <i>The coup was primarily a presence, in contrast to the typical dull "shooters", the most interesting plot, which not only dragged the player into the world of horror, the despair of the Citadel station, captured by the genius crazy AI SHODAN, not only kept in constant tension, but also forced to constantly think about each step and often rely on logic to solve quests and play the game.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>And now, after 5 years there is a sequel.</i>  <i>The revised DarkEngine engine (a legacy from Thief), high-poly textures of creatures and characters (for that time), a beautiful and user-friendly interface, new features (for example, the emergence of psi-magic, replicators) - all this cannot, and should not leave those indifferent gamers who had the good fortune to go through the First System Shock.</i>  <i>And the main difference Continuation from the first part was the appearance of the so-called RPG-elements.</i>  <i>RPG (Roling-Play Game) - from the English role-playing game is a game with a character having some basic characteristics and skills, as well as experience points.</i>  <i>As you progress and complete quests, the character gains points (in this game, cyber modules), which allow him to pump (ie, increase) certain characteristics (only at the player‚Äôs will), which, depending on the chosen tactics of passing, should help overcoming obstacles and completing the quest part of the game.</i>  <i>Expressed RPG-component in System Shock2 is not as bright as, for example, in ‚ÄúFallout‚Äù, therefore it is better to call the genre of the Game not a pure RPG, but a three-dimensional Action with role-playing game elements.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>In short, the plot of the game is as follows: 42 years after the events of System Shock 1, Tri-Optimum Corporation, with the support of the United Nations Nominee, UNN creates and sends to the first Superluminal (FTL) flight the Von Braun spacecraft.</i>  <i>The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating an FTL engine belongs to M. Delacroix, who received the Nobel Prize and the position of Chief Design Engineer on the ship.</i>  <i>The safety of the ship was to be ensured by the destroyer Rickenbaker docked to it, under the command of WB Diego, son of E.Diego, who was responsible for the tragedy of the Citadel station in 2072.</i>  <i>The captain of the Von Braun was appointed A. Korenechkin, an avid and greedy UNN officer, who did not have much flight experience and was promoted to high command for political reasons.</i>  <i>The main role in the game is assigned to a simple soldier, who 4 years before the flight began, VB entered service with UNN as a space infantryman and underwent 4-year training.</i>  <i>Taken in flight and carrying the service on the destroyer Rickenbaker as a simple security officer, he, at the suggestion of Dr. J. Polito, who headed the ship‚Äôs operations and computing center, agreed to an operation to implant a neural-cybernetic interface.</i>  <i>Upon awakening, the soldier found himself already a cyborg-man, partially losing the memory of recent events and to his dismay, found out that the overwhelming majority of the crew had died or had become terrible mutant hybrids, while a new form of life unknown to earth science had appeared on the ship.</i>  <i>Fortunately, Dr. Polito could get in touch with him, who said that the soldier should definitely meet her in her private office on Deck 4 of the ship.</i>  <i>What is behind all this that a soldier will recognize,</i> <i><br></i>  <i>who got to the office of Polito and what consequences this will lead you to find out after passing this Magnificent and Brilliant Game, recognized as one of the Best 20th Century Games of the First-Person 3D-Action Genre with RPG Elements.</i> <br><br>  gameplay video <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DEmFMxOY-sLU">www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmFMxOY-sLU</a> <br><br>  Fans of this game are still creating various mods that improve the texture and model of the game, sounds, fix bugs and gameplay.  The craftsmen taught the game to run on win XP and on many processor machines.  Is this not proof of the success of the game? <br><br>  On the eve of the jubilee of the game, I installed it for pereprokhozhdenie and again, shuddering from the sad monologues of ghosts or from sudden collapses) <br> <a href="http://img229.imageshack.us/i/screennumber001173701.jpg/"><img src="http://img229.imageshack.us/img229/8302/screennumber001173701.th.jpg"></a> <br><br>  and someone from the NPC even knew about the first part of the game)) <br> <a href="http://img139.imageshack.us/i/screennumber004174309.jpg/"><img src="http://img139.imageshack.us/img139/927/screennumber004174309.th.jpg"></a> <br><br>  By the way, the game is included in the IGN rating ‚ÄúThe most terrible games of all times and peoples‚Äù. <br>  Another localization of this game is one of the best works of the studio "Fargus", therefore its Russian version is played very decently and voiced at a very decent level. <br><br>  At the end of 2005, the Open Dark Engine project was launched, which set itself the goal of creating an Ogre-based engine that can run games based on the Dark Engine (in particular, system shock2).  The last revision by the way for the fifth day of this month ... <br><br>  You have not played?  It's time to try, but get ready ... When passing percent, I ran 75% of the time with a gas wrench as the main weapon and not because I‚Äôm a maniac, but because there are not enough cartridges and weapons, or you have a weapon, but you don‚Äôt have the skill to use it use it either huge recoil and delay when shooting.  But the remaining 25% of the time I pumped exotic weapons ran with a laser rapier of blue "a la Jedi".  And do not forget to pick up everything that you see, any garbage is always useful, even if it is just worms ... And if you decide to play the first time, then be sure to install textural and model fashion for the game, the game will become more alive and more modern.  Well?
