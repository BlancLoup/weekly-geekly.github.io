Here are some interesting facts: <br><br>  In fact, there is no war of platforms.  According to the survey results, the Android and iOS platforms are equally interesting for developers, I prefer them to 40% and 37% of respondents, respectively, while only 8% of respondents are focused on Windows Phone.  But at the same time, Apple and Android clearly divided the market between them: the first got its ‚Äúelite‚Äù part, the second got everything else. <br><a name="habracut"></a>

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/de7/168/f1a/de7168f1a7e242d0919f9dc5d4d85f61.jpg"><br><br>  The rapid growth of the popularity of the language Swift.  4 months after the appearance, 20% of mobile developers already use it.  At the same time, 23% of them had no previous experience with Objective-C.  Such indicators can be considered very successful, given that the popularity of Google's Go language has reached only 5% in 5 years. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3fe/0d7/5b1/3fe0d75b19eb4de4be96d24417e6a68c.jpg"><br><br>  The Internet of Things (IoT) is becoming an increasingly popular idea.  Among the developers surveyed, 53% are already related to a similar project.  Moreover, for half of the developers, this is either a hobby or a side project.  Among IoT projects, smart home (37%) and wearable computers (35%) are the most popular. <br><br>  Among the respondents, 33% of developers make games, but only 57% earn more than $ 500. <br><br>  Download the report immediately after registration via the <a href="https://www.developereconomics.com/reports/developer-economics-q1-2015/">link</a> . <br><br><br><h3>  Google tests voice (!) Payments for Android phones </h3><br>  Google <a href="http://read.bi/1Mg1MoP">begins</a> testing a new voice payment service called Plaso.  It is expected to be used in the retail or catering industry.  This is a worthy competitor to the service Apple Pay, which was introduced last year.  In Plaso, a voice will be used as an identifier for the account owner, and for this you will not need to use any particular keyword, but rather to make a few sounds. <br><br>  Google has a lot of experience in using voice control and quite a lot of projects have been implemented in this direction.  As an identifier of a person‚Äôs personality, his voice timbre will be analyzed, and this method is slightly inferior to fingerprints when it comes to everyday use. <br><br>  On the other hand, if we are talking about real conditions, then there are some problems, or rather a high level of noise in public places that will interfere with voice identification, it is easy to record a person‚Äôs voice for criminal purposes ... Yes, and fingerprints can be copied, but it is ten times more complicated than standing in line for fast food with a dictaphone.  This suggests the conclusion that this service will probably have additional proof of identity: passwords, PIN codes, or something similar - and this is no different from what is now with a credit card.  But these are all just assumptions - let's see what will happen as a result when all the tests end. <br><br><br><h3>  Zynga will launch match-3 based on FarmVille </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3c9/6f6/b5a/3c96f6b5af584a608a6faec05d60e94a.jpg"><br><br>  The glory of King and their many Candy Crash Saga does not give much rest.  Not later, as in the last issue, we mentioned the match-3 game from Supercell and Rovio.  This time Zynga rushes to the club, they <a href="http://app2top.ru/industry/zynga-vy-pustit-match-3-po-motivam-farmville-51028.html">launch</a> their variation - a game based on FarmVille.  The working title of the FarmVille project is Harvest Swap. <br><br>  At the moment they have made a test run in the Philippines.  It is too early to draw any conclusions, they were launched only in the middle of January, and the Philippines market is rather modest. <br>  By the way, similarly to Rovio, Zynga became more active and actively rivet small toys.  What is it: explore the market on your own experience?  reduce the risks? <br><br><br><h3>  93% of revenue from the mobile market - from Apple </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/21c/a45/d3a/21ca45d3a3df45fda42910f4024235be.png"><br><br>  The new Canaccord report <a href="http://apptractor.ru/info/devices/apple-poluchila-93-vseh-dohodov-mobilnogo-ryinka.html">shows</a> how much money companies make in the mobile device market. <br><br>  According to them, in the fourth quarter of 2014, Apple collected a record income from the sales of their devices, or rather, it is 93% of the total market!  Behind her, in second place, with 7% - Samsung.  Yes, this is only one quarter, but this gap is simply enormous. <br><br>  At the end of 2014, the picture is slightly different: about 80% of Apple and about 25% of Samsung, and the rest work to zero or even to minus, as is the case with Microsoft.  You can also say that in 2014, only Apple increased its revenues compared with 2013, while Samsung has almost 2 times worse results. <br><br><br><h3>  Nintendo Launches iOS App </h3><br>  Nintendo, the joy of children's (and not only!) Days, has been behaving very unusually lately ... After a big scandal last year, when the company lowered the copyright hammer on innocent yearsplayers (filling up with content ID matches), Nintendo seems to have decided to weaken the leash, allowing all the same to use their games in the video.  But with the condition - 100% of earnings from advertising such videos go Nintendo.  Tum da shh! <br><br>  Okay, what's on the mobile front?  The company more than one year deliberately struggling with emulators of their games.  And here is the official <a href="http://www.cultofmac.com/312341/nintendo-will-release-iphone-app-just-not-one-youre-hoping/">announcement</a> - we are releasing an application for iOS!  Does everyone's heart stop?  Is your throat dry?  Is it possible, the holy grail, to play classic games?  Mm, no, the new application allows you to use icons and avatars of game characters in social networks!  Tum da shh. <br><br>  Satoru Iwata himself, president of Nintendo, believes that publishing games on smartphones and tablets can negatively affect sales of devices from Nintendo itself (although the latest report from the company's iron department is disappointing).  Apparently, officially, the characters of the old Nintendo games will not come to our mobile devices soon. <br><br><br><h3>  Rovio got to the books </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e04/be1/a04/e04be1a042d54873a8a726599b46b233.png"><br><br>  If it is impossible to repeat your success in games, it means that you need to diversify your business and try your luck in related areas.  Soft toys, cartoons, even soda pop with the birds - and <a href="http://www.rovio.com/en/news/press-releases/611/rovio%25E2%2580%2599s-girl-pirates-storm-berlinale/">now the book</a> !  The book, by the way, is not about birds, it is about brave girls.  Adventure novel "The Sinking World" author Minty Das (Mintie Das). <br><br>  The book will tell about five girls who have decided to go on a trip to the sea after the death of their parents.  Even a continuation is planned, which will be released at the end of 2015 - early 2016, which, apparently, will depend on the success of the first book. <br><br>  Why exactly the book and in what entourage they will serve it, until the riddle.  I wonder what goals they are pursuing - a new brand?  Generate a new world for new projects?  Just helping a good man? <br><br><br>  ************************************************** ************************************************** ***************************************** <br>  If you liked the material and you had time to evaluate the professionalism of the authors of this blog - there is an opportunity to join them.
