Then I talked to many people and maybe launched a chain reaction, if not a satellite.  What will come of this, we may soon find out.  Therefore, I tremble with respect to crowdsourcing projects, especially in the field of space.  What was my joy when I learned that the first project was launched in Russia (publication of a book about Venus).  I found the author and interviewed him.

      Personally, from a conversation with Pavel ( <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/shubinpavel/" class="user_link">Shubinpavel</a> ) I learned a <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/shubinpavel/" class="user_link">lot of</a> interesting information about when there was the first space crowdsourcing in the world, who had the opportunity to think of the heliocentric system 2000 years before Copernicus, is it difficult to work with Russian and American archives and what was the situation in space communication station at the time of landing of Venus-4 <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  People </h4><br>  <i>- You met with some people who were related to the study of Venus (for example, with the scientific director of "Venus-15/16", <a href="http://epizodsspace.airbase.ru/bibl/znan/1988/3/3-nov.html">Oleg Nikolayevich Rzhiga</a> ).</i>  <i>Tell me, who from the astronauts / engineers (now living and already gone) would you like to talk?</i> <br>  - It all depends on what you put in the word "talk".  Just talk, with an interesting conversationalist, is always interesting.  And here it does not matter with what. <br><br>  To talk for information ... There are two problems.  The fact is that age is very bad.  But worst of all, over time, the details are forgotten, the exact reference to dates is lost.  For example, now the difference between 1966 and 1963 looks insignificant.  Only three years, but for the study of the history of astronautics, it may be critical. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7b1/8f9/c00/7b18f9c00a685ca4f12689e294aed8f4.jpg" align="right"></a>  For example, in memoirs they often liked (and now sometimes love) to remember how the Queen was bored by the disputes of planetary scientists about the structure of the lunar surface and he simply wrote on a piece of paper ‚ÄúMoon-solid.  Sergey Korolev ‚ÄùAnd it was for this piece of paper that they began to design the device, which later turned into Luna-9, that for the first time in the world, it landed on the Moon and transmitted a panorama from it.  The story is entertaining, and it‚Äôs not surprising that writers-journalists liked it so much that they interviewed scientists. <br><br>  And everything in this legend was good, until this note was found and provided to everyone (after the fact, it turned out that Mark Galley was also able to get it for his book, but it went unnoticed).  In general, it says: ‚ÄúLanding should be counted on solid ground like pumice.  Side speeds are zero ... ‚ÄùI don‚Äôt remember anymore.  But the main thing on her date.  And by that date it became quite obvious that a note was written for a manned lunar ship.  It also follows that the E-6 (Luna-9) was a unique station from a technical point of view.  Since it was developed in the expectation that there will be seas of dust there and it should have sat down in them successfully.  Again, after the fact, it became apparent from its design.  Separate landing, tumbler mechanism, petals. <br><br>  As a result, the memoirs were not particularly lied to, but the real picture was different.  Memoirs and memories are good when you need to understand the general atmosphere that was at that time.  Or, if you need to understand any particular point, you should look like an interview seriously describing the question in detail, preferably having something in your hands to confirm the words and limit the time frame. <br><br>  On the second question, I would still like to meet with Bazilevsky, Marov.  Among the astronauts - Volynov, Eliseev. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9b6/1fc/96b/9b61fc96b65f941004a245440dabe298.jpg" alt="image" align="right">  As for historical personalities.  That, honestly, I would like to talk to <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2590%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D1%2585_%25D0%25A1%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9">Aristarch of Samos</a> .  Better yet, with <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259A%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD_%25D0%25A1%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9">Konon of Samos</a> .  I have a very, very serious suspicion (unfortunately, on the basis of only indirect facts) that he could well modify the heliocentric theory of Aristarch Samoski and translate the planets into elliptical orbits in it.  He had everything for that.  From facts to mathematical apparatus.  And if so, he did it almost two thousand years before Kepler. <br><br>  If you take someone closer, then probably with Keldysh.  Simply, personalities like the Queen or Glushko are clear enough for me.  There are memories and articles.  But with Keldysh all the more difficult.  The personality that I see behind his scientific articles, papers, and notes differs markedly from the one they like to portray in popular articles.  More precisely, they don‚Äôt display the personality at all, but rather a certain set of stories as he was a little ahead of the machine in the calculations and without much effort found errors in the most complicated models.  Hints, that not the person, but the Supercomputer.  There is even a site of his students, who recall various cases from the life.  But, in my opinion, the whole site is best told by his own <a href="http://xn--d1abof0er.xn--p1ai/science.htm">article</a> . <br>  Science compares with music.  Recalls a story from the life of Grieg.  At the same time, the article is, of course, quite a checkpoint.  I do not even know where and why it was written. <br>  On the other hand, even if I was transported into the past, I could hardly talk to him.  He would not answer the questions of a stranger.  And if I had convinced him that from the future, I think that he flunked me with questions <br><br><h4>  Books and Movies </h4><br>  <i>- While preparing for the publication of your work, you read a bunch of books:</i> <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/650/d6f/a01/650d6fa0133756e3b7110a939794bce5.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  <i>Tell us, what are your favorite books (art and documentary) and films (art and documentary) about space?</i> <br><br>  - Well, you ask questions.  A lot of them.  However, if you need it about space. <br>  For example: "The path to Amalthea."  This is one of the few books where the laws of physics were not sacrificed to the laws of the plot.  Moreover, the plot is aligned with the laws.  It seemed, then there were many similar books.  Lem, Asimov, Clark.  But the Strugatsky, in this story, turned out the best. <br>  But this is just an example.  I like a lot of other books.  Just in them space often goes only as a background. <br>  With the documentary a little easier.  Shklovsky "Universe, life, mind."  Karl Sagan "Cosmos" Also, I like books very much about memories of real events (there are a lot of them), but preferably well and interestingly written (there are less of them already). <br>  Examples on space: Chertok's books. <br>  Another example: Picard "Depth of 11,000 meters."  There are a lot of such books. <br>  By the way, a little-known fact (I personally found it).  In Auguste Picard's book Above the Clouds, published in 1936, we have a reference to the books of Korolev and Tikhonravov. <br><br>  Feature films - a standard set: "The Taming of the Fire", "Apollo 13", <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086197/">"The Right Stuff"</a> .  Slightly less standard: "October sky" <br>  Documentary.  It's simple again.  Any documentary films by Klushantsev and James Cameron.  It does not matter, about space or not.  They are maniacs in the good sense of the word. <br>  Again Centrnauchfilm, in its time, produced good films.  I mean films like this: <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/IFA045i_VuM&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhQePcN705mdeaN99Il4zjXF4ioCg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Simply, in my opinion, real documentaries should not be in the form of old archive frames superimposed on a pre-prepared text (the majority).  They must be removed so that they can be referenced and their information used to work. <br>  Such an approach is now, unfortunately, expensive.  After all, you need to take a picture of the whole process for many years.  And there are very few such films. In my opinion - in vain ... <br><br><h4>  Crowdsourcing </h4><br>  <i>- What kind of crowdsourcing projects (past or current) do you like?</i> <br>  - Collecting money for ISEE-3.  Although the first collection of money from the public to the space program was still during the Viking program. <br>  If the Russian projects - the collection of money for the publication of the book "Simple Science".  I understand that they are doing an important thing. <br>  The project "Aquatic".  The idea and the proposal are very good, but they are pulling something with it.  Then there was a wonderful project to launch a stratostat for children.  Looking at these projects, I decided that the popularization of science is important and interesting to people. <br><br>  <i>- A little more about crowdsourcing on the Viking?</i> <br>  - I saw this information, for example, <a href="http://epizodsspace.no-ip.org/bibl/znan/1984/01/1-kometa.html">here</a> . <br><blockquote>  US citizens have already provided similar support to the Viking project, intended for Mars exploration: in 1980, more than 10,000 Americans transferred NASA from their own pockets an average of $ 10. </blockquote>  But there it is formulated that it is not clear what they collected 100 thousand dollars.  On the continuation of the Viking, or on the probe to the comet Halley. <br>  I suspect the viking.  I saw a mention of the collection of money and in foreign sources, but did not understand in detail.  I will try to figure out when I start modifying Mars. <br><br><h4>  Archives </h4><br>  <i>- You worked a lot with archival materials, how are things going with them?</i> <br>  I recently posted a similar movie about Luna-1.  Unfortunately in poor quality. <br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/LIob-GpU_1g%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhg3GhoBKnarCws4KP2V00YPaPRDQw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  In addition to films Tsentrnauchfilm also produced closed films on the project.  And there they told everything.  From design to scientific problems.  In the archive RGANTD, according to the base, there are these films but only on film.  They are not allowed to work with films, they don‚Äôt have the money to scan and the only option is to scan them completely at their own expense.  According to their price 80 rubles - second.  Total scanning 45 minute film will cost 216 thousand rubles. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e28/5f0/a03/e285f0a03b1cda67430d79843e93d48b.jpg"><br>  <i>Scheme of the station for photographing Venus</i> <br><br>  All photos are NASA open license.  Unfortunately, this does not apply to all the necessary photos.  I dare to quote a fragment of the answer from the archives of the California Institute of Technology: <br><blockquote>  It is strictly controlled. <br>  Our standard fee is $ 95.00 per photo.  There is an additional charge of $ 10.00 for scanning setup, and $ 10.00 per digital scan created. <br>  Charge. </blockquote>  For my book I plan to order several photos and schemes from RGANTD.  They take about 350 rubles per snapshot. <br><br><h4>  Excerpt from a book.  Memories of landing on Venus </h4><br><h5>  Venus-4.  The first ever working device in the atmosphere of another planet </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d54/6df/275/d546df275996230ea4cf19d16d238b42.jpg" alt="image" align="right">  It happened on October 18, 1967 at 7 hours 39 minutes 10 seconds.  The station entered the atmosphere at a speed of about 10 km / s.  At that time, no descent vehicle entered the atmosphere at such high speed, even into the earth!  On command from the temperature sensor, a separation of the compartments occurred, followed by a ballistic pause and an exit of the braking parachute, then the main one.  The radio altimeter unfolded, the signals from the temperature and pressure sensors went, the striker smashed the lid, and the Venusian ‚Äúair‚Äù rushed into the vial of the gas analyzer.  Work has begun! <br><br>  There are several eyewitness memories that were at that moment in Evpatoria at the station of distant space communications in the 116th room.  I would like to cite an excerpt from the diary, the famous space journalist Yaroslav Golovanov (local time, Evpatoria).  In parenthesis comments by the author. <br><br>  ‚ÄúEvpatoria.  Center for remote space communications.  Airborne AMC time is the 128th day of flight.  On Earth - the night.  The night when Venus-4 will land on Venus.  Voltage terrible. <br><br>  At <b>5h 41</b> min team: follow the signal! <br><br>  And to be sure: in <b>5 hours 44 minutes 27 seconds</b> - a signal!  Excess of a signal over noises terrestrial and heavenly by 30 times!  Fine! <br><br>  At <b>6.15</b> Venus-4 itself began to ‚Äúsearch for the Earth‚Äù with its parabolic antenna and found it 12 minutes later, while the excess of the signal over the noise immediately jumped from 30 to a thousand. <br><br>  <b>6.48</b> - about 30 thousand km are left to the planet. <br><br>  <b>7.15</b> - about 13 thousand left ... <br><br>  <b>7.35</b> - 400 km to Venus ... It begins still very weak, thin atmosphere, so it's time to shoot the SA.  When CA is shot off, the parabolic antenna, which works so well now, will lose the Earth.  Indeed, the signal has changed dramatically, but, as they say here, ‚Äúthe parabola does not want to die.‚Äù <br>  Finally, at 7.39, the signal from the parabolic antenna completely disappeared.  But after 50 seconds, the CA transmitter turned on.  He is 5 times weaker, but what to do ... <br><br>  <b>7.48.</b>  Venus is 28.8 km away.  Pressure (P) - 960 mm Hg, temperature (T) -78 degrees C ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d6f/6d8/26a/d6f6d826acdd0aaedc92db167a0b94e4.jpg" alt="image" align="right">  <i>(Immediately after the release of the parachute, the first analysis of the composition of the atmosphere of Venus was made. Threshold sensors simply went too far! From them, one could only say that the carbon dioxide atmosphere of Venus contains more than 1%. Some of the manometric, to everyone‚Äôs surprise, too. But able to give a fairly clear result. CO2 - 90% + - 10. The nitrogen content of one sensor was less than 7%, the second was less than or equal to 2.5%.)</i> <br><br>  <b>8.08.</b>  P - more than 4 atmospheres, T = 135 ¬∞ C.  Academician Imshenetsky, an authority in microbiology, said that it is at this temperature that sterilization occurs.  There is almost no hope that Venus has a semblance of earthly protein life ... The SA can withstand pressure up to 15 atmospheres, then crush it ... <br>  Behind my back, in a glass-enclosed booth, sits a very intelligent-looking soldier, with glasses, of those who did not enter the university through competition.  He keeps repeating to someone on the phone the parameters of the atmosphere of Venus, which the operators report every 30 seconds.  Reporting that the pressure in the atmosphere of Venus exceeded 5 atmospheres, the soldier suddenly stopped talking, apparently listening to the question, and then confidentially said: <br>  ‚ÄúComrade Marshal, there is one atmosphere on Earth ... I would give a lot to find out what the stump is sitting on the other end of the line.‚Äù  But this is certainly a military secret! <br><br>  <b>8.54.</b>  The pressure sensor went off scale: it was designed only for 9 atmospheres.  T = 250 ¬∞ C.  T inside the apparatus - 37 ¬∞ C.  ‚ÄúLife there is doggy,‚Äù says Georgiy Nikolayevich (Babakin) thoughtfully. <br><br>  In fact, the sensor went off scale at 8:31.  The last reading was about reaching 7 atm. <br><br>  <b>9.14.</b>  Outside temperature - more than 280 degrees, internal - 54 degrees.  The operator reports that the object is swinging.  Why? <br><br>  <b>9.16.</b>  Signal gone <br><br>  <i>(The last recorded signal from Venus-4 was transmitted at 9 hours 13 minutes 31 seconds. The temperature reached 535 K (262 ¬∞ C).</i> <br><br>  In the evening, Babakin's victory was ‚Äúwashed‚Äù in ‚ÄúUkraine‚Äù.  For science, this is a tremendous victory: in just three hours, earthlings learned more about their heavenly neighbor than in the entire previous history of mankind!  They drank decently, everyone was noisy, shouted, laughed, and Gleb (Maksimov Gleb Yuryevich - the leading developer of automatic space equipment, first in the design bureau S.P. Korolev, then at G. N. Babakin.) Suddenly wept.  Yes, so sincerely, bitterly.  We rushed to him, and he answered: <br>  - Idiots!  What are you happy ?!  Do not you understand that today we are orphaned in the solar system?  I was hoping for Venus ... And now ... We are alone in the Solar System, we are all alone! .. And wept again.
