  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to choose a TV</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello! <br>  Recently, after reading the article <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/hardware/130569/">‚ÄúHow to build an entry-level home media system?</a>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/hardware/130569/">Choosing a TV, player, audio ‚Äù</a> and reading the comments to it, I was surprised to learn that most habrachiteli, though, and keep their nose in the wind and try to know about all the updates and the latest trends, once in the store corny will not be able to choose TV and acoustics.  I sell this equipment, and in particular TVs, and I will try to give a couple of tips on what to look for when choosing. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Let's start: <br><br><h5>  Diagonal. </h5><br>  Yes, it all starts small and the choice of TV, oddly enough, begins with the choice of its size.  So, most readers know that the recommended distance to the TV is 3 diagonals, i.e.  intending to buy a TV with a diagonal of 40 ‚Äù, we will have to watch it from a distance of 40 * 2.54 * 3 = 304.80, i.e.  approximately from 3 meters, but in fact this figure is individual for each individual person, someone (me) is more comfortable and comfortable at a given distance to watch the 55 "diagonal, and someone (say, my parents) will be much more comfortable from 3 meters to watch 37th diagonal.  It should be noted that the trip to the store often does not give an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhat you need - because of the large showrooms, the size is hidden and the 40 ‚Äùdiagonal bought in the store, as‚Äú not very big ‚Äùat home may seem huge, we will not forget that many manufacturers love to play around with the thickness of the frame, the color of the frame and the monolithic design.  The simplest option would be to create a rectangle of white sheets of paper glued together, this will allow you to assess the actual size of the TV you want to buy.  Also note that some manufacturers, such as Sony, have layouts on their websites for printing on several A4 sheets.

    <h5>  Place and time </h5><br>  Such seemingly unimportant moments, because of which so many may be disappointed in their choice of technology.  So, TV screens are frosted, glossy and can be covered with glass, which in practice gives us glare, i.e.  if you buy a TV in the kitchen and are going to watch it during 17-18 o'clock in the evening, and the windows face the western side, then from May to September you can enjoy your reflection on a TV with a glossy screen or glass.  This problem is less pronounced on the plasma due to a higher level of brightness and color, but it is still very noticeable. <br>  As for the place, keep in mind that LCD / LED TVs of cheap and medium price segments distort colors from a certain angle quite strongly, so if you are going to watch a big company or a large angle, pay attention to the plasma or choose a model with the least distortion (on the same flatpanelshd.com there are photos of the TVs they are considering, almost at all angles). <br><br><h5>  Plazma / LCD / LED </h5><br>  Holivars on this topic have been going on for more than one year and, most likely, will not subside until the OLED panels become sufficiently accessible.  In principle, everything is simple, the more expensive the TV - the better it shows, but today the best TV is the Panasonic plasma series VT30, which is cheaper than the top LG, Sony and similar diagonals, but this does not mean that the plasma is better in all respects however, LG xxLW9500 will yield to it quite a bit, and for some moments, for example, to play the console, it seems to me that it is much preferable, although it will cost much more. <br>  For myself, I determined that it is worth taking a plasma from the 50th and more diagonals, on the smaller LED diagonal, simply because it is after the 50th diagonal for comparable money that you get the best picture on the plasma.  Energy consumption in modern TVs is not particularly different, so pay attention to it is not worth it. <br><br><h5>  Manufacturers </h5><br>  I will try to say what impressions about each of the manufacturers I had during my work. <br><h6>  Panasonic </h6><br>  Plazma - heaps of awards and victories, VT30 and G30 / GT30 series are considered to be the best in terms of price / quality ratio, as well as VT20 and G20 / GT20 series before them, a couple of years ago the company adopted a Pioneer palm (along with a bunch of their technologies) and holds her tightly until now.  It is worth noting that, contrary to the divine picture, all other options on the company's TVs are realized frankly through x * ny, the remotes, unlike Sony‚Äôs same production, are light and flimsy, and the menu is not completely thought out, most of the video is not readable from USBishk.  Although, to be fair, I note that, based on my experience, people who bought Panasonic, especially the top series, never insert a USB flash drive into it, the advanced ones put up a media player, the rest are home theater with Blu-Ray, so for the most part the use of TV functionality is limited button "On".  In 2011  the company has attended to work on the Viera Connect platform, but in fact it is nothing more than self-indulgence. <br><br>  LCD / LED is a somewhat overpriced price in Ukraine, in fact we sell them to those who bought Panasonikov plasma and want TV in the bedroom or kitchen of the same brand. <br><br><h6>  Samsung </h6><br>  Probably the best-selling TVs in the CIS countries, the most advanced in terms of reading from flash drives and HDD, do not read except Blu-Ray images and there are some problems with working on DLNA (although they are still several times smaller than the competition). <br>  LCD / LED - Personally, I think their picture is somewhat "multicolored", although fans of football and Avatar-type movies should like it, in general they can be considered as one of the most interesting TVs in the middle price segment.  As for the top models, a lot of questions arise here: last year‚Äôs model xxC9000 is the flagship on paper, but in fact it stands out only for price and design, otherwise it‚Äôs last year‚Äôs xxC7000 in a different package.  Below it goes xxD8000 with steeper features and a newer matrix and everything would be fine, but xxD8000 is essentially the same xxD7000 with a different design and Microdiming function (local dimming of the screen, which due to the fact that the TV is made using EDGE LED technology is not normal It can work in principle and does not add anything to the picture).  Therefore, I would be happy to recommend Samsung LCD / LED TVs up to the 7th series, fans of the very same and technically advanced should look at the competitors. <br><br>  Plazma - in principle, good TVs, if the functionality is important - we take, if the picture is more important - look at competitors.  (although I personally like the PS-64D8000) <br><br><h6>  LG </h6><br>  Personally, I have always been impressed by the products of the Korean giant - reliable, durable and for quite adequate money, the company's biggest problem is the inability to convey its benefits to the final consumer, even as a seller, it is sometimes very difficult for me to explain why a person needs to buy LG.  Let's hope that the company's employees in the blog on habrahabr.ru will try to put everything in its place.  I would buy myself LG - yes, definitely yes, if there was a person who was ready to tell me about them.  On the topic, I can only praise the top TVs of the 9th series, which are easy to play on an equal footing with the Sony xxHX920, and note the convenient remote controls and omnivorousness when reading from flash drives. <br><br><h6>  Philips </h6> <br>  Releases only LCD / LED.  Speaking about this company, I immediately want to mention such a thing as Ambilight, it‚Äôs really cool and after a month of watching TV with this function, it‚Äôs hard enough to change to something else.  And everything would be fine if it were not for this @ @ $% #!  The remote control, which looks like an egg and which I would love to charge developers with a confrontation, also puts it mildly, straining the overall inhibition of the TV interface and the inability to read some files from a USB flash drive.  When buying, you should forget about the preset settings, spend an hour on normal screen calibration and I think that the quality of the picture and the Natural color will not disappoint you.  It is also worth noting that many TVs from the summer batch had a BP defect, which was solved one week in service, I don‚Äôt know if the problem was removed now or not.  In general, good TVs, ideal for bedrooms, especially if you are going to hang on the wall or put next to the wall (preferably flat), those who think about buying would recommend to immediately choose a media player. <br><br><h6>  Sony </h6><br>  They are attracted by the design and integration with the rest of the company's equipment, in principle, normal TV, which should be taken if you own other equipment from this company (from Blu-Ray players and cinemas to PlayStation and Walkman), pleases the very beautiful design of Monolith TVs NX and some HX and very saddened by the artificial restriction on reading. Mkv files from USB and HDD.  Particular attention should be paid to the HX series - the picture is super. <br><br><h6>  Sharp </h6><br>  At the mention of this Japanese company, many will remember the famous Quatron (the fourth subpixel of yellow color), i.e.  The picture in these TVs is formed not by using RGB (red, green and blue) subpixels, but by using RGBy (red, green blue and yellow) subpixels, the company's engineers say that it allows you to more accurately convey the skin color They were famous for the natural colors of human skin colors, I don‚Äôt know why (yes, the company employs racists and there is no black subpixel there), but although the TV is able to cover a large color palette at the output, it simply does not have enough information on the input  ode, i.e. there are no sources that tell him how to use the yellow subpixel, how does tv learn how to use this subpixel ?, the answer is that it calculates itself, i.e. the yellow color can be better and better, but by "naturalness" it is not It has nothing to do with sharps - good TVs, with a somewhat sophisticated menu, super design, metal and glass in the case and an adequate price. <br><br><h6>  If it is interesting, then in the comments I will try to answer all the questions on TV and write an article on media players and acoustics, a link to my place of work, if they want to give in the comments.  I work in Ukraine, but I think that everything said applies to all CIS countries </h6></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/132248/">https://habr.com/ru/post/132248/</a></p>
