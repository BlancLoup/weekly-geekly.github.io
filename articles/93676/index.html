  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What would you like to see in future laptops</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In continuation of <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/amd/93592/">this article</a> I would like to develop the theme of the future of laptops.  With the advent of the new core i3, i5, i7 processors, Intel's lines have broken very well.  I recently went to the store and bought myself a new i5-based laptop, and I was less interested in the processor frequency.  Even now I don‚Äôt remember how many megahergts are there.  And I have never thought that the computing power is not enough.  Indeed, it is time to think not just about power, but about usability. <br><br>  So, what I would like to see with the next purchase of the laptop.  Listed below.  I wonder if you share my opinion?  Or maybe there is something to add? <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      - I consider it absolutely necessary to make a new fastening of the covers and keyboard, when it would be possible to lift the keyboard with the touchpad on top, close the cover and cover the top first, thereby connecting to the external screen would not have to use an external keyboard.  And the laptop itself would not interfere on the table.  Another option would be to disconnect the keyboard from the laptop and use it as a wireless one. <br><br>  - It is necessary to make the bottom of the body inside the add.  usb ports, so that you can once insert different dongles from mice, external keyboards, keychains, yot and other small devices. <br><br>  - Ability to connect and move several hard drives inside the case.  This is more concerned with connecting SSD drives, which are not yet very large in size and are quite expensive.  That is, a 128 gig system SSD and another terabyte for information would be optimal.  By the way, it is absolutely not necessary to stuff raid controllers. <br><br>  - Ability when buying to abandon the pre-installed system, or buy it a replacement with only a small surcharge.  What is the point for me to buy a laptop with a pre-installed home basic, when I need a higher system. <br><br>  - Ability to display a mini screen with information on the battery status and signal quality of the wireless network on the lid or somewhere else.  In addition, the built-in defragmentation and scanning utilities, antiviruses that would work at a lower level, would not prevent autonomously. <br><br>  - It seems to me that the system of autonomous backups would not hurt even over a wireless network if there is a server in sight.  We turn off the laptop (we put it to sleep), and it automatically finds the server and synchronizes the necessary data. <br><br>  - The ability to replace the battery without turning off the laptop, the possibility of using conventional finger-type batteries in an additional battery, which can be bought everywhere in case of emergency. <br><br>  - Ability to connect the power supply from different sides. <br><br>  This is still an incomplete list.  There will be something to think about, but in general, if I had such a laptop, it would be more convenient to live.  Let me remind you that this is a subjective view and it is based on personal experience. <br><br>  Update, and if you are engineers, implement :-) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/93676/">https://habr.com/ru/post/93676/</a></p>
