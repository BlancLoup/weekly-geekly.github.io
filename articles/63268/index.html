  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Higher technical education</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  After reading <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/study/63262">this topic</a> , I first commented and then became furious ... no, at first I became furious, and only then - I commented it, but after that I decided that I wanted to write about it.  Therefore, I will give here my comment with almost no bills and edits.  (for reference - in the original topic, the author with a lot of errors, both spelling and factual, writes about the optional nature of education in general and technical education - in particular). <br><br>  Firstly, I‚Äôll immediately signify my ability to talk about the topic raised by the author - I‚Äôm 26 years old, I graduated from university in 2006, and now I work for a major well-known IT company.  Who cares - there are details in the profile, but anyway - I understand the subject a little.  I graduated from the 6th faculty of the Samara State Aerospace University, probably not the best in the country, but definitely the best in Samara, and probably in the whole Volga region of a technical educational institution. <br><br>  What do you think is being taught at the university?  No, if you went to some economic or legal, in order to kill eight and a half hares - I can not vouch for the fact that they will teach you something at all, but what is taught in IT faculties?

      1. Mathematics.  The mother of all sciences, without knowledge of mathematics, the concept of an engineer is unthinkable; she is the main one for almost everything that can be thought of as applicable to computer science. <br><br>  2. Probability theory, statistics, analysis of random processes.  In general, I see no need to explain why this is necessary. <br><br>  3. Physics.  I will not talk about the importance of physics as such, but in my opinion, in addition to its own knowledge, it gives the student the first example of how to apply the mathematical apparatus to solving real-world problems.  The probability that the physics will be useful to the future engineer is very high, I would rate it at 15-20% <br><br>  4. The group of "low-level" subjects - electrical engineering, circuitry, interfaces, and the culmination - the course "Microprocessors".  Sorry, but a software engineer is obliged to understand how it all works - and it is better to understand how what he is using at the moment and a couple more alternatives work.  If you are connected with iron - this is your daily bread, otherwise - there will definitely be no harm from this knowledge (I used it many times). <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  5. Databases.  No comments - you need to know this, even if you don‚Äôt work with them.  And you need to know not SQL and not ‚Äúaccess‚Äù, as the author so eloquently put it, but understanding how it all works, how it works on the lower level, what an index is, why it is needed, what it is, what a transaction is, what integrity is. and so on.  Without an understanding of these concepts, it seems to me extremely doubtful that a future programmer will be able to use them correctly. <br><br>  6. The group of "high-level" items.  The list may differ, but as a rule, it is the theory of formal grammars, logic, functional and declarative programming languages.  Incredibly expands the mind, and it is very possible that it will come in handy later. <br><br>  All this prepares the student for ... <br><br>  No, not to the diploma.  To real life.  In life, an engineer will almost certainly have to deal with tasks that have to be solved in a super-short time, under the conditions of severe pressure and the most severe lack of information - studies allow him to go through all these circles of hell, to gain this experience, and if he also worked during studying is learning how to do a hell of a lot of things at the same time, prioritize, choose, in the end, the ‚Äúsacrifice‚Äù - something that can be neglected in these circumstances.  It is this ability to learn quickly, ‚Äúdigest‚Äù wild amounts of information in the shortest possible time, to draw conclusions in the context of insufficient data (I heard something about it somewhere, but I don‚Äôt remember what, and the exam is already underway - to hell with it, logically, it should work like this: ...) - all it does is a universal engineer, a person who is able to work in his field, can quickly switch to an adjacent, no stranger to the scientific method, can get new knowledge almost from the air and apply it to its activities. <br><br>  That is why you need a Higher Technical Education - that is what makes it from a schoolchild - an engineer.  There are self-taught, I do not argue - but they will really make it themselves, but to us mere mortals, this will greatly help (help, and will help) to solve our real problems. <br><br>  PS transferred to the blog of the original topic.  I understand that I have listed not all the disciplines that are vital for the engineer - therefore, add in the comments. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/63268/">https://habr.com/ru/post/63268/</a></p>
