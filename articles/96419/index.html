      The biggest problems occur when you try to force yourself to do something new.  For example, start running.  Or become organized and productive.  Either start a blog, get rid of credits, or even just simplify something. <br><br>  I used to always complicate things, so much so that, remembering this, I don‚Äôt know whether to cry or laugh.  But life is a constant learning, and these mistakes made in the past allowed me to become who I am.  Even now, I constantly make a bunch of mistakes. <br><br>  <strong>Example 1</strong> <a name="habracut"></a>  I wanted to be more productive, so I read GTD (Getting Things Done, an excellent book by David Allen).  I bought utilities that other GTDs recommended.  He created several lists, tried a couple of dozens of different software and paper techniques for maintaining these lists.  Every GTDesign is familiar with this problem.  GTD, like any other productivity system, can become very complex. <br><br>  Now my advice to the past is: stop complicating.  Productivity, as I see it now, is a simple thing.  You take the most important task you want to do today, get rid of everything that distracts you and start working.  Even the list is not needed, although if it is there, and it says what else needs to be done, then nothing terrible.  Let there be one list.  But do not dwell on it.  Just take one task and start working. <br><br>  <strong>Example 2.</strong> When I wanted to get rid of loans, I tried various financial programs.  I made the tables.  Created debt payment schedules.  I wrote down all the expenses, etc.  It was difficult, believe me. <br><br>  Now I know that everything is simple.  First, stop spending money on the unnecessary (I know, it's easier said than done, but as soon as you learn to recognize <a href="http://mnmlist.ru/pereosmyslenie-neobxodimogo">what is needed and what is not,</a> and can stop buying under the influence of pulse, everything will become much easier).  Secondly, repay as much as you can on one of the credits (just make a reserve reserve of at least $ 500 first), repay the loan, and then start paying the next one. <br><br>  <strong>Example 3.</strong> When I started blogging in January 2007, I studied about a dozen different platforms and blogging tools.  I read many books and articles on this topic.  This is normal, I just studied. <br><br>  But now I know that being a blogger is easy.  Choose a topic and write.  Then click "publish".  Throw a link to the post on Twitter or Facebook, although it is not necessary.  Just write interesting and / or useful articles, and people will eventually find you.  Just write and publish. <br><br>  When you start something new, you naturally have to learn.  But understand that although learning is good, the process itself should not be difficult.  Find the easiest way to do what you want and start doing it.  And learn in the process. <br><br>  <em><strong>about the author</strong></em> <em><br><br></em>  <em><a href="http://zenhabits.net/about/">Leo Babauta</a> is a blogger and author of several books.</em>  <em>One of his blogs, Zen Habits, has become one of the 100 most widely read <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technorati">Technorati</a> versions.</em> <em><br><br></em>  <em>On Habr√© there were already translations of this author: <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/freak_ideas/71909/">1</a> , <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/freak_ideas/72030/">2</a> , <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/freak_ideas/73288/">3</a> .</em> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/96419/">https://habr.com/ru/post/96419/</a></p>
