  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Overview of the Universal Huntkey Laptop Charger</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> A mobile person is such an informal slogan for many IT companies working with technologies of the 21st century.  Everyone wants to minimize the product itself, and make its filling to the maximum universal.  Therefore, now we have thin mobile phones, netbooks, nettops, PSP Slim, tablet PCs, a whole range of devices with the letter i at the beginning and much more.  I got into the hands of a universal adapter from the company Huntkey, which can charge a laptop of any manufacturer and model. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a17/d12/f7a/a17d12f7a59fe5199d68677ce0be3d4c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Honestly, before testing this adapter, I didn‚Äôt even come across any analogues for such a device.  Therefore, it was very interesting for me to see how this device works.  I am ready to share the results with you. <a name="habracut"></a>

      I have met with HuntKey before, testing their power supplies.  Frankly speaking, the test results of the HuntKey power supply unit surprised me at that time, since all the voltage lines were slightly higher than the nominal, which, under load, gave close to ideal values ‚Äã‚Äã- 3V, 5V, 12V. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e85/999/cda/e85999cda49b2b4bc091a80b1d79419d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The device comes in a nice and small package.  On the front side, the Huntkey promises us device efficiency above 87%, as well as support for energy-saving technology. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f28/8ed/49c/f288ed49c9a76c9d1f00a1b90e917149.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  On the back side in 12 languages, including Russian, the main technical characteristics of the device are written. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b91/4f4/530/b914f45305eef19a10b310761e4b3b30.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Information, at first glance, a little, but all the necessary manufacturer indicated.  But let's talk about the characteristics below. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7d3/18a/52e/7d318a52e2b8597edcf85e5165993fc0.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  On the side of the manufacturer reveals the secret that inside the package. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/69c/290/8ce/69c2908ce60da9f41721a9f654cde061.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Package Includes: <br><br>  - adapter; <br>  - power cord; <br>  - 10 different nozzle connectors; <br>  - handbag for storage and carrying; <br>  - user's manual. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/267/602/4ec/2676024eca2ea7d57eb7dd6b3409e9a3.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Everything is packed inside so that when I tried to assemble the kit back in plastic packaging, I had to work hard.  Power cord did not want back to the box. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/56e/011/4ad/56e0114adda9f6846e3f562e6c084114.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The power cord of the adapter is also universal, any power cord from the power supply or monitor will work.  The package itself is probably quite simple.  There are no ryushechek and color booklets with product advertising.  Yes, it is not necessary, only all the most necessary. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1ef/956/34b/1ef95634bf1f1ec55e20652e04daabf1.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  A set of nozzles from the side looks pretty cool.  Nozzles differ in diameter, it is easy to select the desired brute force method.  Well at least there are only ten of them.  The main thing is that the laptop model is on the compatible list.  Such a list is written on the front side with small text at the bottom of the package.  Supported brands include: HP, Dell, Lenovo, Asus, Thinkpad, Acer, Compaq, Toshiba, Samsung, Sony, Gateway, Panasonic, Sharp, Fujitsu. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/375/c4b/5bd/375c4b5bd408702d4d90a0ed777cb374.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In the instructions, the manufacturer briefly talks about his device, talks about the certificates obtained and the security systems used.  This information is enough to safely check the operation of the device. <br><br><img src="http://img682.imageshack.us/img682/7332/dsc1236f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Externally, the adapter also looks like native charging from laptops.  Immediately wondered why all laptop makers should not make a universal power adapter that would be compatible with all laptops. <br><br><img src="http://img532.imageshack.us/img532/1967/dsc1229c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Testing tools:</b> <br><br>  Fluke 123 Portable Oscilloscope <br>  Current tongs Fluke i410 <br>  Digital multimeter Mustech M890G with a portable thermal sensor. <br><br>  <b>Testing method:</b> <br><br>  A rheostat (150W) with the possibility of adjustment was used as a load. <br><br>  To calculate the efficiency, the current at the input (220V) and at the output (19V) was measured.  Total BP was tested in 9 load modes: 10-20-30-40-50-60-70-80-90W.  The time for each test was at least 20 minutes.  Pre-BP was heated at a load of 20W for an hour. <br><br>  The current protection was triggered when the load was slightly higher than 95W, there were no shutdowns from overheating (the room temperature is 24 ¬∞ C).  The short-circuit protection also worked well - the power supply turned off, there was no damage.  After complete de-energizing and removing the short-circuit, the power supply unit can be used again. <br><br>  <b>Results:</b> <br><br><img src="http://img232.imageshack.us/img232/5679/picture1tp.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The first diagram shows the dependence of efficiency on the load on the adapter.  The maximum efficiency was 89% with a load of 70 watts. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fba/bab/517/fbabab517c1ea489a795414c6fc2f9bc.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Measurement of voltage indicates a linear decrease in voltage with increasing load on the adapter.  At a maximum load of 90W, the voltage was 18.66 V. The deviation from the stated 19V voltage is only 2%, which is within the normal range.  After all, the manufacturer promises an output voltage of 19V (+ -5%). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4e0/85a/bb9/4e085abb921205209f83ac22d8b0dc1d.png" alt="image"><br><br>  At maximum load, the adapter warms up to 65 degrees, which, in my opinion, is the normal temperature for this type of device.  My native adapter from the Asus laptop at work after 30 minutes is heated to the same temperature. <br><br>  <b>Conclusion</b> <br><br>  The tested device meets all the declared characteristics.  And in combination with its versatility, it looks very attractive.  If the original adapter had failed, then after talking with the Huntkey adapter, I would undoubtedly make a choice in favor of versatility.  Naturally, I could not resist and ran through friends with this adapter.  It worked without problems with laptops: Asus, Acer, Lenovo, Toshiba, Compaq and Sony.  This gives a good assurance that trouble-free work will continue with the other declared brands. <br><br>  Thanks to Alexey Artyukh for testing the device. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/91234/">https://habr.com/ru/post/91234/</a></p>
