Perhaps the reason for its external simplicity?  Or is it that it makes you feel as if you are already on board of an airliner, that is, it conveys something sublime?  Or is he just cool?

      Or is it something else - one that no national brand could understand except Southwest Airlines. <br><br>  Of course, all the leading service organizations, swear in their loyalty to the consumer-service, and some brands are actually trying to make this part of their identity.  These are those whose colors are specially chosen to convey warmth (like orange in the Home Depot logo) or reliability, even tireless effort (what can Brown do for you?).  However, nowadays, the super profitability of the aviation industry, one of the companies noticeably more successfully than others, copes with its brand-as-service image, and not only declares it in its brand identity. <br><br>  This is not only the fact that Southwest does not require $ 100, which other airlines are demanding for making minor changes like changing tickets on the same date, or making changes to your route.  These are more subtle, however, no less important, the ways in which the airline realizes that simple brand message that consumers can rely on to have a pleasant, non-stressful experience. <br><br>  The fact is that in order for such a straightforward brand name as Southwest Ding to work, the company must confirm its word (its slogans and promises) every day with deed.  How exactly does Southwest do it? <br><br>  They started from their website.  Just compare, somehow, the <a href="http://www.southwest.com/">Southwest</a> website. <br>  and the <a href="http://www.aa.com/">American</a> site.  What exactly is each of them in terms of service-experience that any consumer expects? <br><br>  Perhaps Southwest is the only major carrier that can be compared with aggregator sites that specialize in luring users who would like to reserve a place in a hotel.  Anyone who has ever tried to deal with the <a href="http://www.expedia.com/">Expedia</a> customer service team can complain to me about minimalistic web design that justifies itself in terms of customer service ‚Äî and that's great.  The trick is that for web design intuitive simplicity in terms of viewing options and subsequent purchase and there is a good customer service. <br><br>  And this is the main reason why the majority of consumers, having worked with different sites, demonstrate a much greater desire to shop on the websites of leading travel agencies than on the websites of specific carriers.  This is evidenced by the results of a study conducted in September by consulting firm consumer-experience eVOC Insights and technology provider for web-based research solutions. <br><br>  As you know, when a consumer makes a decision, the key factor is the loyalty program of the supplier.  Studies have found out that no one is surprised by this - that participants in loyalty programs are willing to pay more for places in a hotel and two times more than those who do not participate, the higher the probability that they will return, buy again and recommend it to others.  However, participation in the program does not guarantee purchases.  For example, studies have shown that 46 percent of Marriott Rewards participants and 44 percent of Starwood Preferred Guest participants, having tried all the options, prefer to buy on Expedia or Hotels.com than on the sites of the suppliers themselves. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThere are many factors that affect consumer purchasing decisions, including price, content, functionality and rewards,‚Äù said Liz Edison, co-founder and managing partner of eVOC Insights.  "Expedia wins over each of these parameters and stands, turning its service-oriented face to the consumer." <br><br>  If you are attracted to the user interface of these sites, have you ever wondered why?  Web consumers are looking for simplicity - even the most discerning of us, prefer clear interfaces like Google instead of something complicated.  At stake is not a small amount.  With more than 150 million consumers who buy tour-trips to the Internet and more than $ 70 billion of online income that was predicted in 2006, the competition between travel agencies and, in fact, suppliers online, is quite tough.  Does this mean that you can expect company websites to become easier to navigate? <br><br>  One of the reasons that I cited the example of Southwest Airlines is that they persistently keep their products inaccessible through the websites of online travel agencies and consistently set their prices below the level of other carriers, while remaining the industry‚Äôs most profitable airline.  Obviously, this is also associated with non-payment of pensions to hundreds of dismissed pilots, as well as with the GUI of their website.  But as for their branding, no other company has achieved such a unity of word and deed. <br><br>  What does this mean for those of us who are not involved in the aviation or hotel industry?  Very simple.  Your client interface ‚Äî a service that confirms that a brand is true to its word ‚Äî should always be at least as important as the products your company sells.  This remains relevant, regardless of whether you sell through advertising or otherwise - it is the service and simplicity that delivers the customer with happiness. <br><br>  All successful businesses solve someone's problems.  If your service for someone creates them, he will not last long. <br><br>  <b>Translation from English to:</b> <br>  <a href="http://blog.worldwebstudio.com/">blog.worldwebstudio.com</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/30904/">https://habr.com/ru/post/30904/</a></p>
