Part 1</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e73/fbc/0bb/e73fbc0bb62b4706beb2d5ba0d1dfaed.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  If you are going to study and abroad, and the dollar and the euro does not cause positive emotions, then there are several main sources of funding from which to start looking.  Tell us more about one of them. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Among the main sources of finance for foreign students are the universities themselves, where the student intends to apply.  The general rule is this: the stronger and more prestigious a university, the more sources of funding for foreign students it has.  So, in high schools of Ivy League in the USA you can study absolutely free of charge.  To do this, you must, of course, be an extraordinary person in an academic sense, and preferably with a non-standard background.  There is such a joke that if you are a black woman lesbian without a leg, with a child, and in your family you are the first to receive a higher education, then you have excellent chances.

      The second source of funds is various funds, associations, non-profit organizations, etc. Their activity is usually rather narrow, but there are options.  For example, the Anita Borg Foundation supports women who want to get a degree in programming, the Rotary Foundation, everyone who wants to work for peace, the Jackie Chan Foundation - young actors who want to study in the US, etc. <br><br>  Another option, and we recommend starting the search with him, is government programs.  Those.  training is paid by the government of the country where you intend to go to study.  Of course, there are a number of conditions.  As a rule, there are age restrictions for applicants and you need to return home and apply the knowledge gained there.  Below we describe the main government programs in different countries of the world. <br><br>  USA.  <a href="http://fulbright.ru/ru/russians">Fulbright program</a> .  There are scholarships with full coverage for those who want to enroll in the magistracy in the United States.  You do not need to go anywhere in advance.  You submit documents before May 15, and if you pass to the second round and pass the tests well, which, by the way, will also pay, the program itself will offer the university that suits you.  You can also go to graduate school, but for one year in order to collect material and conduct research. <br><br>  Germany.  <a href="http://www.daad.ru/">DAAD program</a> .  Allocates scholarships for study in Germany for graduate and postgraduate programs, as well as a bunch of different short programs, starting with German courses and ending with short-term and medium-term studies in Germany.  Deadline for Master's Scholarships: November 30 <br><br>  Great Britain.  <a href="http://www.chevening.org/russia/">Chivning</a> .  The scholarship is very competitive.  Russia is allocated 10-15 places.  The scholarship allows you to get a master's degree in Britain.  But will not always cover the full cost.  More precisely, it will cover 12,000 pounds for training + the same amount for accommodation.  And this is not enough, if you aim at a top university.  You yourself enter a university and apply for a scholarship in parallel. <br>  Deadline is November 15th. <br><br>  Australia.  <a href="https://internationaleducation.gov.au/Endeavour%2520program/Scholarships-and-Fellowships/Pages/default.aspx">Endeavor Awards</a> . <br>  There are scholarships for both graduate and postgraduate programs.  The scholarships are full, but also quite competitive.  Preference is given to natural science and technical specialties.  Just go to learn, but do not do research, the grant will not work.  Education, even in the magistracy should be research in nature.  At the time of applying for a scholarship, an offer from the university should already be on your hands. <br>  Deadline: June 30 <br><br>  <a href="http://mfa.gov.il/MFA/MFA-Archive/2003/Pages/Scholarships%2520Offered%2520by%2520the%2520Israeli%2520Government%2520to.aspx">Israel</a> <br>  The scholarships are focused on citizens of some countries, including Russia.  If you are under 35 years old and already have a bachelor‚Äôs or master‚Äôs degree, you can continue your studies in a master‚Äôs program, postgraduate course, go on summer courses, or do research work in Israel.  At the time of application you must have an offer from an Israeli university.  An interesting detail - the scholarship is given only for 8 months maximum.  That is, if the study lasts 2 years - for the second year you will have to look for another source of funding.  Deadline: November 30 <br><br>  Finland.  <a href="http://www.studyinfinland.fi/tuition_and_scholarships/cimo_scholarships/cimo_fellowships">CIMO Fellowships</a> <br>  Scholarships are intended only for graduate students.  Those.  if you study somewhere in graduate school and want to conduct some kind of scientific research in Finland in the period from 3 to 12 months, then you are welcome.  The volume of scholarships: 1500 euros per month.  We need to agree with the host university about your readiness to accept you.  At the time of filing an application for a scholarship can not live in Finland for more than a year. <br>  There are no deadlines, applications are accepted 5 months before the expected date of commencement of studies / work in Finland <br><br>  Sweden.  <a href="https://studyinsweden.se/scholarship/swedish-institute-study-scholarships/">Scholarships Visby</a> <br>  Once, in 2010, education in universities in Sweden was free.

Given the complexity of the language and the small number of English-language programs in state universities of the country, scholarships cover not only bachelor‚Äôs, master‚Äôs, postgraduate, or research studies, but also one or two year‚Äôs courses in Chinese language courses.  There are age limits for each level. <br>  Deadlines vary by university. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.esteri.it/mae/en/ministero/servizi/stranieri/opportunita/borsestudio_stranieri.html%3FLANG%3DEN">Italy</a> <br>  Scholarships are awarded for postgraduate and postgraduate programs, teachers who teach Italian, for short-term studies, for Italian courses, and bachelors, starting from the second year of study.
