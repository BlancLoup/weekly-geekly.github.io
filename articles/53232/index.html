      One more thing.  Please read to the end before leaving a comment.  I know ‚Äúmany bugs‚Äù, but I am sure you will not regret the 3-5 minutes spent, especially since at the end you will have a surprise :) <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  To begin with, I will explain what I mean when I say that people ‚Äúendure‚Äù.  Perhaps you have met in your work ‚Äúcolleagues‚Äù whose ideal working day is to look at photos in classmates or in contact who are very lazily fulfilling their work duties and are offended when management sets new tasks for them.  If you are not working yet, and you are learning, then surely you have 10-20 people in your group (in some universities) who don‚Äôt understand, they don‚Äôt read most of the subjects for which studying is self-abuse. .  I still have a bunch of such friends who argue that it is allegedly already ‚Äúlate‚Äù to change the profile, that too much effort has already been spent.  Guys, is it 19 then years late ?!  Tell it to Bill Gates or Steve Jobs.  Let's see what they answer.  Honestly, I myself thought so very long.  And then I ran out of iron and drawing :)) <br><br>  Here is another example.  Many people do not consider it necessary even to throw cigarette butts and chewing gums into bins.  They do not believe that their city is their home, and they do not want to enjoy being in it and feel comfortable.  Everyone throws, and I will give up, what is this? .. <br><br>  Such people endure life.  Instead of changing something alongside themselves for the better, they accept the conditions and repay the system with their hatred.  I don‚Äôt like work ‚Äî I won‚Äôt work, I don‚Äôt like studying ‚Äî I‚Äôll buy an exam, I don‚Äôt like dirt ‚Äî I‚Äôm trash myself. <br><br>  I think that now you are mentally waving away, convincing yourself that all this is not about you.  I am very happy if this is true.  But still read to the end. <br><br>  Perhaps you thought that now I will begin to ruthlessly drench such people.  Not!  I am convinced that such a person is in each of us.  Well, almost :) Like any difficult question, this one does not have a simple answer.  In addition to the actions of the person himself, external factors play a significant role in his fate.  For example, many self-realized businessmen call such a thing as luck among the main reasons for their success.  Luck is an external factor.  Let's leave the innate abilities of a person (including the ability to self-improvement) aside and talk about external factors.  Why do we tolerate? <br><br>  This is an extensive philosophical topic, which can devote more than one book.  I offer you a number of my Sunday answers to this question: <br><br>  <b>First</b> , we have no examples to follow.  No idols in a good way.  What is the main character of Russia of the 20th century?  Father of nations, murderer Stalin?  Astronaut Gagarin, since the moment of his feat almost 50 years have passed?  Already better, but a long time ago.  Who would you call the hero of Russia in the last 17 years?  Thinking? .. Gorbachev?  Yeltsin?  Khodorkovsky?  Putin?  But there is a need for heroes.  This is due to the high demand for red T-shirts with a sickle and a hammer and for other Soviet symbols - during the existence of the new Russia we have no good examples.  Sasha Bely, Dima Bilan ... <br><br>  Why does the corpse of communist Lenin lie in the very heart of the capital?  Do we still live in the USSR?  Yes, even if he was the first of the Democrats, I ask, what the hell should an embalmed human body do in the center of my city?  Are we in ancient Egypt?  No, we have, thank God, the Internet, Blue Ray and meteorological satellites.  Why does this suit everyone?  So, the first point is the <b>absence of ideals, the lack of a clear state policy in this direction.</b> <br><br>  <b>Secondly</b> , the existing system does not allow a person to be realized.  There are a lot of sub-points here: corruption, arbitrariness of courts, not free media, bureaucracy, taxes ... And education!  This is a very important point.  The existing education system does not allow a person to find something that he would be really interested in doing.  In the USSR, a man plugged a hole in the state plan.  But they made a quality plug from it.  It was a bad system, but it gave its results.  It's worse now.  No control, no quality, no freedom of choice. <br><br>  My classmate finishes the Physics Department of Moscow State University.  The last 2 years he studied economics.  He wants to work in the big four consulting.  The diploma will be written something like "manager in the field of science."  Prior to that, he spent 4 years with all the details and hysteresis crammed physics.  Question: why ?!  Why would a person who will work as an economic consultant for 4 years teach physics and write in a diploma that he is a scientist ?! <br><br>  About schools.  I was lucky, since the fifth grade in our gymnasium there were elective courses, and we could gradually grope those areas that are interesting to us.  Still, it did not help everyone.  In ordinary schools, even this is not.  Question: why?  Let a child from childhood do what he is interested.  Let him instead of the annual skalachivaniya stools in the classroom of labor learns something extra about mathematics, about painting, about technology, about interesting places in the city - about anything.  Why rivet these housewives and householders when humanity invented Ikea? <br><br>  By the way, in my opinion, the USE would be in a step for the better, but only if corruption was much less.  So point two is an <b>ill-conceived education system.</b> <br><br>  Well, I convinced you that everything is bad?  Not really, really.  The surprise I promised at the beginning is that this post is not just the whining of another liberal and moralist from LJ.  I have a set of very specific tips for you.  Want to follow, want not, but this is the best I can share with you.  This list can be doubled, tripled, raised to a power and still will not be complete.  And the best answer to it will be your addition.  So, let's begin: <br><br>  Look for books, seminars, video courses that interest you.  Now this stuff is full.  Google will help. <br><br>  Do not spend the day off, sitting in ICQ or in contact.  Open aroundme.com or maps.google.com (with photos linked to the location) and find some unexpected interesting place near your home.  Invite friends. <br><br>  When you choose a movie for Friday evening on the site of the Poster, do not sort by the number of screens, but at least by estimates.  Better yet, use the other tabs on this site: exhibitions, museums, theaters.  There are also many interesting things. <br><br>  Wrap the tasteless gum in a piece of paper and put it in karma.  Throw out the nearest urn. <br><br>  Do not watch TV (with rare exceptions, one of which is football) :) <br><br>  Chat with interesting people.  Meet the new ones. <br><br>  Finally, share with your friends all the new and interesting things you have learned.  Do not keep these treasures in yourself.  Do not focus only on your needs, pull your friends along. <br><br>  Thank you for reading.  Happy first spring of you! <br><br>  UPD.  Dear friends!  The decision to transfer this post to drafts was made by the administration due to crossposting.  At the moment, managed to reach an agreement.  I want to say that I did not set myself the goal of promoting my LJ.  I like Habr much more :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/53232/">https://habr.com/ru/post/53232/</a></p>
