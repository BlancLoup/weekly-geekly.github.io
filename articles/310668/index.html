  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Foreign experience and its use in business</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Surely at various conferences, speeches, webinars, you have often heard phrases like ‚ÄúTraditional retail dies‚Äù or ‚ÄúTraditional banking services will soon die.‚Äù <br><br>  The crisis has nothing to do with it.  And, I think, I‚Äôm not much mistaken if I say that this applies to almost any business.  It's all about innovation, or rather, the growth rate of the emergence of new technologies and their development.  The speed of development / emergence of technology is now 5 times higher than 5 years ago.  Look what we have now almost everywhere - Big Data, Cloud services, analogs of artificial intelligence, Augmented reality, Virtual reality, 3D printing. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Of course, not all new technologies will greatly influence your particular business, but here‚Äôs your reality: 3D printing already turns engineering, retail and construction.  BlockChain may turn over banking services in the near future.  Artificial intelligence and Big Data in general turn a huge number of areas, ranging from transport, marketing, sales now, well, what to go far, ending in the distant future with our workplaces with you. <br><br>  According to the technical director, Facebook, in 10 years there will be an opportunity to transfer the necessary information to all the senses.  Rather, there is a partial opportunity now, and in 10 years it will be used in business.  This can change a huge number of business areas, including tourism, entertainment, and so on.

      The speed of creating something new from concept to industrial design is also amazing.  German Gref wrote a phrase attributed to <b>Uber</b> after a trip to Silicon Valley - the competition from the Chinese has reached such an extent that it seems to us: if we woke up in the morning with a very interesting new idea about new products, then at lunch, when we are going to meet, to discuss this, the Chinese have already reproduced it. <br><br>  The same presentation talks about value.  In them, consumer goods (commodities) are everything that concerns the production of televisions, telephones, laptops, tablets - it sucks, then that costs nothing.  But the technologies are really worth it - they are the ones that give the market value of the company.  At <b>Intel, HP</b> , the iron-making division is second class.  The greatest value of new products / technologies.  Imagine if we were producing iron of this level, and it would be considered consumer goods?  See where I lead.  We live with you at what time?  During the crisis.  What is very important to do in a crisis?  Cut costs and attract new customers. <br><br>  You understand that all these technologies give huge competitive advantages, firstly, they will come to us anyway, and they will have to be used, otherwise competitors will do it, and, secondly, if used correctly, they will get a lot. <br><br>  2-3 years ago, at retail conferences they talked about iBeacon technologies and Push notifications of customers when they come to the store.  On smart mirrors and interactive windows.  Now it does not introduce only lazy. <br><br>  Previously, video cameras with sophisticated analytics were used for analysis in stores of hot / cold zones and customer routes.  At the conference, they recently said that Ultrasound can be used for this and there are already startups implementing this.  Innovations concern not only gadgets and technologies, innovations concern business models and services. <br><br>  <i>Just to serve the buyer is not enough for a long time, he needs to convey emotion, delight him.</i> <br><br>  One large network increased its sales 3 times only due to the fact that it installed a terminal for charging cell phones in the store, another serves its customers with the help of robots, the third one offered to abandon the standard format of shopping - you first choose what you like on the screen, and then they bring it to you in the fitting room, and so on.  In retail, one of the main performance indicators is Revenue / m2.  It was like this before, but it doesn‚Äôt work anymore - people come to the shops, choose goods and buy through the Internet or through aggregates.  And recently, more and more through mobile devices. <br><br>  And so in all areas.  Look at the business models that we successfully adopted: <br>  - <b>Uber</b> appeared in California in 2009, <b>Yandex.Taxi</b> in 2011. <br>  - <b>TaskRabbit</b> - a service for solving various household and business problems, 2008, the Russian equivalent of <b>YouDo</b> - 2012. <br>  And a lot of such examples. <br><br>  Global aggregates are looking for new business models and products such as <b>Amazon Echo</b> , <b>Google Home</b> are emerging, which study everything you say, can self-learn, control technology, and later buy what you want, considering what suits you best. .  We have with you some very interesting advantages. <br><br>  As IT specialists, we are the most innovative people in any company.  Who except us knows about all the new products and technologies, and can imagine how to use them?  It is our task to offer and apply new technologies. <br><br>  As Russian companies, we do not need to act by trial and error, as in the west.  We already see which technologies have taken root there, and which are not, we can even roughly understand what effect the introduction of this or that technology will give. <br><br>  Well, as Russian companies during the crisis - we can try new technologies on very favorable terms.  There is no money and no sales markets for everyone, so integrators / start-ups / manufacturers are ready to work on very favorable terms, with free pilots, the Success Fee scheme.  What gives us the opportunity to take virtually no risks - did it work out?  Liked?  - We use.  No, we forget. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/310668/">https://habr.com/ru/post/310668/</a></p>
