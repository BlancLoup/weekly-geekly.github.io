Taking them into the hands does not create the impression of fragility, they are fairly light, but when they have enough weight, that would not create an obsessive impression of the need for careful use.  The headband has a small deformation radius (bend), while the ear cups fit snugly to the ears and do not create any discomfort.  Headphone adjustment will satisfy any head size with a retractable classic headband that will provide the perfect fit.  Fastening ear cups have several vertical and horizontal non-fixed positions that allow you to arbitrarily fit under the ears. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8c6/8cb/717/8c68cb7179923ae175f279a9d68e4e26.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  On the outer edge of the cup have a soft velvet finish, with the inside of vinyl.  Despite being similar to the style of the 80's ear cups, they are very comfortable.  Even after prolonged wear, no fatigue or discomfort was noticed.  The headband has a small insert from a fabric lining with a pad that distributes the force evenly.  Headphones have a cable of increased strength and a length of 1.4 meters. Also included is a case for storing and carrying headphones.  Since the cups have a turn of 90 degrees, finding headphones on your neck also does not create any inconvenience during periods when you are not listening to music. <br><br>  Since these are open headphones, there is a slight sound leakage.  and listening to music at full volume, you can create some discomfort to others, and if you remove the headphones from your head, and also turn on the music at full volume, then this volume is enough to listen to music in a room or office without any effort . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4d7/b9d/8d5/4d7b9d8d534ef086a2d5a1241724b8c0.jpg" align="left" alt="image">  <b>Sennheiser HD 238 Precision</b> offers good sound with significant sound depth and level of detail. In general, the sound is equal and clear.  Low and medium frequencies are quite detailed, but when listening to music as 128-256 kb / s, the sound becomes drowned and not expressive enough.  Moderately perfect and clear sound in headphones is achieved while listening at 320 kb / s.  At 100% volume, the headphones do not hiss and do not distort the sound, but only slightly pleasantly vibrate on the bass.  When listening to music at 100% loudness in the first minutes, the music seems to be rather loud, but over time, the eardrums get used to this level of sound, and the sensations from listening to your favorite music achieve complete satisfaction. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/84b/038/8a6/84b0388a6897221aa01bc564d597132e.jpg" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e10/9bc/b83/e109bcb8341ccacbd014875eb7a0498b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>The answer to the main question that people ask me,</b> <b><br></b>  <b>- ‚ÄúHow do headphones behave in the subway?‚Äù</b> <br>  My only answer is that since they are open, the sound of the metro of course penetrates, however, when listening at high volume, the sounds of the metro seem distant, there is no general hum, you can hear the sounds of a suitable composition occasionally if you stand near the tunnel from which it leaves.  The voices of the speakers announcing the landing and the station are not heard at the time of playing music.  So you have to take off the headphones to hear the next stop.  In the city, the surrounding hum and noise is almost not felt. <br><br><h1>  disadvantages </h1><br>  Among the shortcomings, I would like to mention only the glossy ‚ÄúSennheiser‚Äù logo, on both sides of the headband, as well as two ‚ÄúSennheiser‚Äù icons on the auricles.  Some personal dissatisfaction was due to the long cable.  When used with a player, I wanted it in short.  However, I got used to them so much that I began to watch movies on a PC in them, and in this regard, it seemed to be the opposite of a small one, and the standard 2 meters of cable were not enough. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/72d/399/681/72d399681dec7a6abc92ce07ae1199e7.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The second controversial point was the need to use the ‚ÄúNotmalize‚Äù filter in the sound editor to process some of the songs, since they did not sound loud enough at the maximum sound setting.  But this problem was solved after a week of experiments, after which I realized the whole need for owning the media library as 320kb / s in MP3 or FLAC. <br><br><h1>  Advantages: </h1><br>  - Good build quality and decent sound quality for relatively little money. <br>  - 2 years warranty compared to other products of a similar price range. <br><br>  The most common reviews, both in the CIS and abroad, about these headphones are: <br>  <b>- "Headphones are worth the money spent,"</b> I can not disagree with that.  I hope this post will help you in choosing headphones, and listening to the sound quality when buying, will be the final stage before buying.
