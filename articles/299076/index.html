Part 2</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  We continue to tell how to deal with the queue of e-mails.  <a href="https://megamozg.ru/company/usedesk/blog/24308/">Last time</a> we discussed the sorting of calls and the priority, the distribution on the team and the appointment of a responsible person.  Today we will give three comments on each of these processes. <br><br><h4>  <b>1. Thieves out of turn!</b> </h4><br>  One of the parameters for sorting calls is customer value for the company.  Depositors with a million or credit card holders, regular or new customers, users with a ‚Äústart‚Äù or ‚ÄúEnterprise‚Äù tariff. <br>  Those who pay more are counting on privileges and do not want to wait. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The easiest way is to mark clients in the system and assign their requests high priority in the general queue.  This is suitable if the "special" accounts for no more than N% of the time of the team. <br> <a href="https://usedesk.ru/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c2d/fed/374/c2dfed37423a4db686677dd0e7226abb.png"></a>

      If an extremely urgent request began to crowd in anticipation of a response, create a queue 2.0.  and for its processing select a group of employees.  To simplify your task of separating the wheat from the chaff, immediately give the ‚Äúspecial‚Äù customers another email. <br>  MailChimp, for example, went further: they provide email support only to paying users.  For those who are in the trial or use the Starting up tariff there is a cool documentation with clear navigation and video, which is enough to start.  Advanced users have advanced questions - and MailChimp calmly focuses on them. <br><br>  Operational support without waiting can be a source of additional income.  Think about how to directly link the cost of your services and the speed of support. <br><br><h4>  <b>2. New-simple and old-complex</b> </h4><br>  When it comes to SLA, and you shorten the time of the first answer, try to divide the command: let part process new requests, while others deal with old ones.  In this case, the attention of the first group is focused on simple questions that are solved in a couple of seconds.  As soon as a complex request is caught and the agent hangs over it, it forwards it to another group.  This approach kills two birds with one stone: <br><ul><li>  some users are delighted with instant answers </li><li>  the queue is reduced and the team morale rises </li></ul><br>  It remains to decide on what basis to select agents in each group.  The first option: agents draw lots and change roles from time to time - suitable for small teams of up to 15 people with approximately the same skill of agents.  More teams, with routine, do this: beginners sit on light sample queries, and old people deal with difficulties.  It helps to motivate beginners and does not let experienced employees get bored. <br><br><h4>  <b>3. Branching tasks</b> </h4><br>  Customer problems are not always solved on the first line of support.  For financial or technical issues, help from colleagues from other departments is needed.  And the closer the first support line to the second, the happier the client. <br><br>  Let's look at a simple interaction scheme, when a call is transferred from an external queue to an internal one: a queue of "charmed" requests that require additional proceedings.  The client has not received a transfer from you and wants to clarify the details of where you sent the money. <br><ol><li>  Support accepts appeal. </li><li>  Creates a separate branch of the discussion of the issue with accounting. </li><li>  Accounting gives comments. </li><li>  Support sends a response to the client. </li></ol><br>  In this process, it is important that the support control the request sent to the colleagues, and the accounting department responded promptly.  Thanks to internal comments in <a href="https://usedesk.ru/">Usedesk, the</a> agent communicates with colleagues right there in the request, without switching to another system or mail.  Bookkeeping will receive a notification immediately as soon as a request is assigned to them. <br> <a href="https://usedesk.ru/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4f9/31d/fd2/4f931dfd23ef465d8fae185c6fda2d34.png"></a> <br><br>  Change the status of "on hold" to send a request to the queue for processing.  In order not to forget about the request, we set up a rule: in a day, if colleagues do not give a comment, a reminder will come to the support.  The accounting department will add its comment, change the status and the person in charge so that the request ‚Äúmoves‚Äù again to the support. <br><br>  Thus, when several units are working on a request, it is important not to lose control and keep a history of changes.  At any time you need to see at what stage the decision and who is responsible. <br><br><h4>  <b>Combination of processes</b> </h4><br>  After examining and testing <a href="https://megamozg.ru/company/usedesk/blog/24308/">these approaches</a> , take a little from each to create an effective process for managing the queue.  At first, try working with an unallocated queue, processing requests from old to new.  So the team gets the same workload, and customers answer in a fair queue of time.  Then start experimenting with filters and tags.  Usedesk will show if the number of requests with a specific topic has increased.  This will help to understand that it is time to single out these appeals in a separate queue. <br> <a href="https://usedesk.ru/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5cf/b24/9f5/5cfb249f5a3f40589ed31aad65ec4dc6.png"><br></a> <br>  After you have figured out what generates the largest volume of requests, add or update the knowledge base.  Now that you have reduced the queue down to the most important requests, feel free to optimize.  Determine which tickets to solve first and distribute to the team. <br><hr><br>  The only right decision how to form and process a queue does not exist.  Someone needs to hire new people; on the contrary, someone decides to get rid of idlers, automates processes and redistributes the load.  Experiment and find a way that suits your product, your team and, most importantly, your customers.  Go share in the comments how you handle the queue. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/299076/">https://habr.com/ru/post/299076/</a></p>
