There were more than a hundred of them.  Among them were both purchased discs and recorded ones.  They had films, cartoons and music. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bde/9af/879/bde9af8790134b5f8e9451308f34af26.jpg"><br><br>  I collected them because I hoped that someday I would review and listen to them.  But more than 10 years passed, and I never got the disks.  All this stuff went to the trash.

      Everything has changed.  Now I have nowhere to put them in and have nothing to reproduce.  The development of high-speed Internet, cloud and streaming services has changed my world of content consumption.  Now I use streaming services by subscription. <br><br>  Why by subscription?  Yes, because for a ridiculous monthly fee, I get access to all the new products in great quality from all the devices available to me.  In this article I want to talk about several services and applications that I use to consume content. <br><br>  Perhaps in a few years and these methods of content consumption will be outdated ... wait and see :) <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I'm an avid lover of Android, so the devices <br>  - TV without SMART, but with Minix NEO X7 connected with Android <br>  - NEXUS 5 phone with Android <br>  - Samsung Tab 2 tablet with Android <br>  Therefore, we will focus on applications and services for Android.  It is clear that there are other analogues, but I described exactly what I use myself. <br><br><h1>  Music </h1><br>  My choice was <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.google.android.music">Google Play Music</a> .  For only 159 rubles a month, I get access to almost the entire musical heritage of the planet and musical innovations.  You can listen to songs from both the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.google.android.music">Android</a> device and from the <a href="https://play.google.com/music/listen">browser</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b20/d09/ad2/b20d09ad2c5344a69291f87783b0d941.png"><br><br>  Based on my preferences (likes of the songs you like), the service can play random selections.  In 90% of cases I like the choice of system :) <br><br><h1>  Films </h1><br>  My choice was on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.google.android.videos">Google Play Movies</a> .  There are always a lot of movies in excellent quality.  Many new products.  Movie rental from 49 rubles.  Buying a movie is always 3-4 times more expensive.  I usually rent a movie, because the probability that you will return to watching it is very small again :) But I buy cartoons, children love to watch the same movie many times.  The film can be downloaded to Android devices for offline viewing with children on a long trip.  And at home on the TV through Android watch console.  You can also watch movies through the <a href="https://play.google.com/movies">browser</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/183/1df/008/1831df008b764e44be320ae2e87fcc91.jpg"><br><br>  <i>Life hacking: Did you know that if you use a subscription to Google Play Music, then you get a 10% discount on movies and apps on Google Play.</i> <br><br><h1>  Books </h1><br>  Then my choice fell on <a href="https://bookmate.com/">Bookmate</a> .  You can read both in the browser and through the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.bookmate">mobile application</a> (in offline mode as well).  A huge advantage is synchronization.  Those.  On the way, I read books on the phone, and the house on the tablet.  And I start reading from the place where I finished reading. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/85f/3f3/468/85f3f3468b994857ab4e882593e9f45c.jpg"><br><br>  I really liked the social component in the service, when you can watch what your friends are reading, share your impressions about the books you read and watch the shelves of other readers, on which many interesting things are presented. <br>  By the "standard" subscription for 150 rubles a month you get access to most of the books, but by the "extended" subscription for 269 rubles to all bestsellers and supernovae. <br><br>  <i>Life hacking: Pay better with a card or through Google Play.</i>  <i>When paying via PayPal, the payment is written off in dollars at a not very favorable rate :)</i> <br><br><h1>  For kids </h1><br>  There is a great app <a href="https://goo.gl/yH11ku">Zanimashki - educational games</a> .  Inside the application dozens of interactive magazines on various topics for children from 2 to 6 years.  For only 100 rubles a month, I get access to dozens of magazines.  Children love to work with them and learn something new about dinosaurs, our planet, the universe, time, days, weeks and more. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/be8/444/4c5/be84444c558948b3a42446b457f0b5ca.jpg"><br><br>  <i>Life hacking: there is another cool application <a href="https://goo.gl/sFvf1l">Tales and books for children</a> .</i>  <i>But my children grew out of fairy tales and therefore I refused to subscribe to this application.</i> <br><br><h1>  Let's sum up </h1><br>  Total per month I spend: <br>  159 rub.  (Google Play Music) + 120 rubles.  (2-3 movies Google Play Movies) + 269 rubles.  (Premium subscription Bookmate) + 100 rubles.  (children application) = 648 rubles per month. <br><br>  Decide a lot or a little.  A good book costs from 300 rubles. A movie ticket is 300 rubles.  per person. <br><br>  But I have already made my choice.  Only for 648 rubles a month I get: <br><ul><li>  access to a huge selection of content music, books, movies </li><li>  quick and easy search for legal content </li><li>  content synchronization between different devices </li><li>  excellent quality video, music, books and applications </li><li>  ability to download content for viewing, listening and reading offline </li></ul><br>  Disadvantages: <br><ul><li>  monthly payments </li><li>  chances are that the services that I use will suddenly close and I will lose the history and everything I acquired </li><li>  need the Internet to download content to view offline </li></ul><br><br>  And which subscription services do you use?
