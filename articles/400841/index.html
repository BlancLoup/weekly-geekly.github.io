As the efforts of Hollywood technology turn into a mockery</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <b>Hello% username%!</b>  Films in the genre of "fiction" are beautiful because they almost always push people and technology.  Either the heroes acquire new abilities with the help of these very technologies, or the technologies, in turn, limit people and homo sapiens bravely overcome these limitations.  And sometimes the technical innovations in the films turn into a farce, and not necessarily the fault of the "filmmakers".  We understand why it comes out this way and recall the loudest cinema blunders associated with IT. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ba2/7c6/579/ba27c657951a4756af041dfee8e2c790.jpg"></div><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <i>‚ÄúCelebrated on February 23.</i>  <i>We don‚Äôt have military men in the company, so nobody spoiled the holiday</i> , <i>‚Äùthe</i> <a href="https://xakep.ru/2001/06/19/12860/">classics</a> wrote, and it‚Äôs amazing how right they were!  Because fantastic action films, which seem to have been created for geeks and in the name of geeks, it is the technically competent audience that is most confused.  when it comes to watching any fantastic action movie geek.  Some of the pearls of Hollywood writers cause a smile, some - irritation, and some of the nuances - shame.  Today we will figure out what phenomena provoke a bouquet of such feelings among us, and ponder whether there are truly prophetic pictures among the films in the fiction genre, or all the technologies in the art picture are depicted on the principle of ‚Äúfinger to the sky‚Äù, and the audience is only think of technical nuances instead of stupid screenwriters? <br><br>  Today we learn a little to understand the varieties of Hollywood nonsense.

    <h2>  ‚ÄúDumb viewers won't notice the difference anyway‚Äù </h2><br>  The cutest reception in the cinema is when, under the guise of technology from the future, the usual giblets of programs and operating systems flash from the desktop from desktop computers. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b9a/778/5b1/b9a7785b150e4695a39ffc8637eacb68.jpg"></div><br>  Geek discontent is swept away by the old technique ‚Äúthe author sees it so‚Äù and ‚Äú <a href="http://anekdotov.net/anekdot/all/ltspblshgztchtt.htm">you need to read more newspapers</a> ‚Äù.  Few techniques of idiotic amid with this sauce: <br><br><h3>  Good robots are based on DOS, evil - based on Mac OS </h3><br>  The computing machine is a sinister and mysterious creature.  He speaks in an incomprehensible language, asks for mystical data, self-diagnostics is engaged periodically.  And, just in case, closes the logs of what is happening to yourself review.  For example, the notorious Terminator, instead of sending logos to himself directly to the brain, transmitted them to his ‚Äúorgans of sight‚Äù.  Such a robot goes without external administration and reports to itself "what a good day, as well as the efficiency of my systems," and then detects the enemy and shouts the words "the enemy is within reach!" Across all the borders of his peripheral vision. <br><br>  And it would be okay if Robocop was engaged in it, in which the neurons of the brain interact with the silicon processor and flash memory - <s>nothing</s> certain human features are alien to him.  But after all, the digital machine initially flaunts in the same way, simply because the execution of the code by the machine will not be spectacular and convincing for the viewer. <br><br>  Robocop's life, literally, depended on the stability of MS-DOS ‚Äî instead of a software add-on optimized for interaction with a living organism, the robot-policeman was content with a handicraft-modified system for x86 processors. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5de/f32/054/5def320540004303aac1de71e181176b.jpg"></div><br>  <i>"What is it like to know that MS-DOS is responsible for your livelihoods?", As if asked from Robocop</i> <br><br>  The above-mentioned Terminator, by the way, is not content with Microsoft products, and implements ‚Äúpremium user experience‚Äù - it works on Apple II hardware and reads life hacking for Apple enthusiasts from Nibble magazine at the same time that it ‚Äúkills humans‚Äù. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4ff/a61/dad/4ffa61dad71d43e5a0d87e1a079e3661.jpg"></div><br>  <i>War is war, and reading about life hacking Apple OS is priceless</i> <br><br>  The T800 software from the movie "Terminator 2" miraculously did without disgrace on the air, but the Terminator TX from the third part of the franchise runs on Mac OS 9 and updates itself with Quicktime Player in its free from routine time. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/640/316/f90/640316f90e404720be0653a3ba2186a4.PNG"></div><br>  <i>It's time to update the quicktime miss terminator</i> <br><br>  But do not rush to think that Apple is always playing on the side of the bad guys - do not forget that the Macintosh Powerbook 5300 was able to load the virus into an alien ship on Independence Day and save humanity.  Information security specialist note: on the day of the apocalypse, use Mac OS to hack extraterrestrial operating systems. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/981/227/1f6/9812271f66cf4bf994f73998f6451ec0.jpg"></div><br>  <i>Break open aliens with Apple laptop and save Earth</i> <br><br>  And do not hesitate to address the US President on such a crucial day - otherwise, all the work will be done by experts from India, right in Windows Media Player <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a48/193/f77/a48193f777764073bf5d58d39b0b2ae4.gif"></div><br>  <b>now playing</b> <br>  <b>Title:</b> Stupid Movie <br>  <b>Director:</b> Bollywood Knight <br>  <b>Actor:</b> computer hacker 80 lvl <br><br><h3>  Aliens cause damage to mankind with banners on JavaScript, cops interrogate suspects in the game chatter </h3><br>  The methodology "Mikhalych, draw us terrible computer gizmos for kints!" Has always justified itself, so the cinema is not shy to turn into a mockery of not only earthly, but also alien creatures.  For example, in the movie ‚ÄúStargate: The Ark of Truth‚Äù (2008), the alien robot wrote code for pop-up windows in JavaScript ‚Äî that is, it caused even more torment to humanity by its activity than aliens usually do. <br><br>  In the hit counter series, the missile guidance system includes WordPress code, and in the recent action movie Jason Bourne (2016), hackers ‚Äúuse SQL to hack databases‚Äù (not SQL injections).  No reason not to hit the rally on the road! <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/523/555/ba3/523555ba33534545a09472a7783e52e9.jpg"></div><br>  <i>Well you are computer scientists, you know better!</i> <br><br>  Justice also works in the most sophisticated way - criminologists from New York (TV series "CSI: Crime Scene New York") create a "graphical interface using Visual Basic to track down the IP criminals."  IchSH, succeed in this! <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hkDD03yeLnU" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  In another series, the same law enforcement officers track gamers in the MMORPG Second Life to interrogate him.  They are almost certain that the suspect is no longer alive, but they track the activity of his game character.  Notice that the gamer is online and call him in for questioning in the game. <br><br>  The gamer does not want to communicate with the guards and ... does not turn off the computer or game chat, but runs away from the character that the cops have created!  The best and only way to avoid unpleasant conversation in an online game!  Not sparing the keyboard and mouse, the cops <a href="http://www.ebaumsworld.com/videos/the-show-csi-ny-hard-at-work-trolling-gamers/81459669/">catch up with him</a> and enforce justice.  And so it will be with everyone who badly focuses on locations in the MMORPG! <br>  By the way, we already know about those who do not regret the keyboard and mouse - that the keyboard can be a weapon in the hands of hackers and office workers, but the theme of the impact of a <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/kingston_technology/blog/278984/">mechanical keyboard with a metal plate</a> has not yet been revealed by the cinema.  Perhaps because for the sake of this would have to rewrite the age rating of the film. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3ab/b2f/efa/3abb2fefa4ba4febb19914db3c361110.gif"></div><br><br><h2>  Overshot with prophecy </h2><br>  People of art always want to let the public know that they are aware of new trends and can experience technology with all their hearts.  But almost any ‚Äúhigh-tech‚Äù in artistic works becomes obsolete and in a short time becomes an anecdote to himself.  If the melancholic song about the ‚Äú <a href="https://youtu.be/_cRoNjBwsYA">Internet addiction</a> ‚Äù performed by Zemfira still awakens nostalgic feelings (and even then, you can not help but grin at the sound of the dial-up modem), then today you already feel uneasy about the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DwMgPuulKV-4">hymns of</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DucpS1iYvMGc">greatness of</a> SMS.  But the songs of vital come and go, but the fantastic action films, comedies and thrillers live longer, so the creators miss the mistake when the film goes into the category of classics. <br><br>  A couple of years ago, it was fashionable to nod at the predictions in the movie ‚ÄúBack to the Future 2‚Äù, whose authors guessed many trends (smart watches / glasses / clothes / home, finger scanners, drones) and missed when they portrayed massive flying cars, usable fuel of waste and hoverboards (the latter remained a sham despite several presentations on the topic). <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/334/222/bb2/334222bb2b67487f969afba415cf10c6.jpg"></div><br>  <i>One of the few details of the film, which did not coincide with reality</i> <br><br>  Most of all the absurdities of films are shown in the predictions about how computer management will be and <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/187332/">their interface</a> in the distant future.  Even if we forget that in the film ‚ÄúDoctor Who‚Äù humanity uses Apple keyboards 50 thousand years after their appearance, the examples of naive interpretations of the future do not end there. <br><br><h2>  <s>In my mouth my feet</s> Hard my head! </h2><br>  It is impossible so easy to take and not remember in the Kingston blog a movie with the most stupid prediction about drives - "Johnny Mnemonic".  The very idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa thriller about a messenger-carrier of information is brilliant, ‚Äúalways young‚Äù Keanu Reeves plays talentedly, but ... 80 gigabytes in my head?  In 2021?  Even in 2016, this volume will be enough except for a <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/kingston_technology/blog/275984/">half Call of Duty</a> , not to mention any detailed video files.  Moreover, 5.25-inch models with 1 GB of flash memory existed back in the 1990s - didn‚Äôt the writers have the courage to fantasize something more worthwhile for 26 years? <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7a9/fbe/869/7a9fbe869cc6485eb20188a8630b1d0a.jpg"></div><br>  <i>‚ÄúSo many things, so many things - they don‚Äôt even fit in my head!‚Äù</i> <br><br>  Moreover, we do not know how his very analog brain was turned into a digital storage device.  Implant-HDD in the head?  Somehow not very suitable for a courier with, ahem, active lifestyle.  With him, it is enough to fill a bump in the forehead in any minibus, so that the "roof went" finally and irrevocably.  In general, if the film receives a remake, Johnny‚Äôs extraordinary memory will have to be substantiated by implanting a solid-state drive.  <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/kingston_technology/blog/248898/">HyperX Predato</a> r, for example, but faster and terabytes of commercials at 20 (the future), for example? <br><br>  However, over time, the creators of the cinema themselves realized that power was not behind hard drives, but behind flash drives.  Because in the drive compatible with computers in 2014, it is possible to record not only the essence of ‚Äúsimple men‚Äù, but even Scarlett Johansson Lucy, drugged with drugs, with her brain dispersed to one hundred percent efficiency.  Given that the heroine Johansson in the film uses "craft" technology to create a drive, it is unlikely that her gift to Morgan Freeman is based on serial flash memory.  But if we assume that Lucy is located on the most capacious flash drive at that time (1 TB, <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/165011/">guess who the manufacturer is?</a> ), We can calculate that one Scarlett Johansson is about 12 relaxed and 6 agitated Keanu Reeves with much better portability.  And on the new record-breaking <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/kingston_technology/blog/284500/">USB flash drive with a capacity of 2 TB</a> with these assumptions, you can write Lucy in two copies.  If such ‚Äúdual-core‚Äù drives turn out to ‚Äúdeploy a system‚Äù - the male half of humanity will line up for such LiveUSBs. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bc8/0ce/7d0/bc80ce7d05e34e08bab7052b8cf31e99.jpg"><br>  <i>In the next life I want to be a flash drive</i> <br><br>  A naive Will Smith naively tries to hide from the US National Security Agency only with an eye on their ability to take pictures from the satellite and cameras, along with telephone conversations.  Even declassified information (projects "Echelon" and Main Core ") suggests that the secret services acted much more comprehensively and skillfully than Hollywood scriptwriters could have imagined.  And in the 1990s, too. <br><br>  New time has deprived the creators of stories of the ability to use old methods - now the main character can no longer be sent to phone booths throughout the city, which the mysterious villain will call.  Because there are no more phone booths on the streets.  And the sinister VHS tapes that killed their viewers are no longer there either.  As well as autoresponders from which heroes forget to listen to important warnings.  Like anonymity online almost.  As the opportunity to get lost in the city, as long as the GPS is caught at every corner.  And how many movies would not have been born if the 1970s were used by mankind in their modern smartphones? <br><br><h2>  Do films predict the future? </h2><br>  Oh yeah!  Even as predicted!  Contrary to the fact that most motion pictures fall ‚Äúwith a finger to the sky‚Äù, a huge number of films were predicted (or designed - do not forget that the developers of gadgets also watch movies) our digital present. <br><br>  Three-dimensional interfaces, artificial intelligence, hybrid computers, retina scanners and fingerprints, human-like robots (giant and not-so), voice assistants, high-tech prostheses, video telephony, cyber attacks, and much more were <a href="http://www.glow-internet.com/infographics/50-years-of-visionary-scifi-computer-interface-designs/">predicted by science fiction writers</a> and feature films, and not managers of IT corporations in ranting at briefings. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/39c/70a/8a5/39c70a8a53d74dd5b773f1842df2b5be.jpg"></div><br>  <i>Often films show gadgets that we see in reality decades later</i> <br><br>  Moreover, we can distinguish nonsense from providence in works of art only after a long time, and there are much more reasons for joy from the realized digital aspirations than motives for disappointment.  Good and joyful to you high-tech future, our dear enthusiasts! <br><br><h2>  Is it really bloopers? </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d44/d96/589/d44d96589e4b468e91e09daf05cf03d6.png"><br><br>  The delusion of a single person, who with the technique on ‚Äúyou‚Äù is not a big deal.  But the nonsense propagated in the films outgrow, at least, into myths, so it is possible and necessary to incriminate ‚Äúfilmmakers‚Äù in nonsense.
