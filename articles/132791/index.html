Some of the tips I use, some - it does not work, there are still tips that are not applicable to me personally.  In principle, a more or less clear mode of the day helps to live, it is.  But sometimes it is very difficult to start this very day.  Then everything is good, everything goes according to the scheme worked out.  But getting up in the morning in the fall or winter for some categories of people can be a very difficult task. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/e1797e4e/bc750543/a65aaff5/28994b00.png"><br><br>  Unfortunately, I belong to this category of people.  In trying to find a reliable solution to this problem, many solutions have been tried.  Some time ago I tested one more way - interesting, and at the same time, effective.  It's about a special kind of alarm clock.

    <a name="habracut"></a>  So, as mentioned in the introduction, getting up in the winter and autumn is a real meal for me.  At the same time, there are no special problems in spring and autumn, all problems begin somewhere from the beginning of October.  Previously, I just set a more or less loud signal on the software alarm clock on my phone, and woke up from a sharp sound (well, or from loud music).  You know yourself, such awakening does not bring any special vigor - the brain torn out from some sort of sleep stage is in a state of chaos for quite a long time. <br><br>  But time is ticking, it's time to get back to normal and start working, or at least go to the kitchen to make coffee for yourself (coffee does not help me to wake up, I just like coffee drinks).  In general, when abruptly awakened, working capacity appears after about an hour or two after the eyes have opened.  Not so long ago, I decided to apply the advice I heard somewhere, and downloaded the recording of bird songs onto the phone.  At the same time, the sound of the alarm clock was set to a smooth rise, so it all looked like a spring or summer morning.  It helped until the morning was still light.  When the day was finally shortened, and the night became much longer, the way with the birds in the phone stopped helping. <br><br>  Why dont know.  Maybe because the bright morning and the singing of birds really deceived my sleeping brain, and he decided that since all was well, it was time to get up.  And as soon as the Sun began to rise later, it was no longer possible to fool the brain. <br><br>  I ran into the decision by chance - I was looking at different reviews on Habr√©, and on the website of Master Kit I saw the Dawn alarm clock, the description of which seemed interesting. <br><br>  The description said that the alarm begins to gradually increase the brightness of the lamp for a certain time before the beep.  At the same time, light acts on the body in such a way that it stops producing the sleep hormone, and as a result it is much easier to wake up at the moment when the sound signal sounds.  There is a natural awakening, "rising" in the phases of sleep, from the deepest to the easiest.  And the volume of the sound also increases gradually, while the type of sound can be changed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/cfacc00c/a42e6170/bd21b39e/f8c44d01.jpg"><br><br>  Here are the characteristics of the device, taken on the site with a description of the "Dawn": <br>  <i>‚Ä¢ Size: 176x176x255 mm</i> <i><br></i>  <i>‚Ä¢ Weight: 480 g</i> <i><br></i>  <i>‚Ä¢ Range of radio waves: 88-108 MHz</i> <i><br></i>  <i>‚Ä¢ Instead of a signal, it uses 4 sounds of nature to choose from or an FM radio station</i> <i><br></i>  <i>‚Ä¢ You can set up to two alarms with different alarms and wake-up modes.</i> <br><br>  In general, I requested this device, saying that I was with Habra and would like to test the alarm clock.  The guys from Master Kit agreed to send him to me, almost free of charge, taking the promise to write a review on Habr√©.  It‚Äôs a pity that they don‚Äôt have any helicopters, it would be nice to take them for testing). Well, of course, there was another option - to get a device and <s>buy a ticket to Uruguay, hide there and do plastic surgery;</s> don‚Äôt write anything :-) Do not cheat and behave well. <br><br>  <b>Unpacking and familiarizing with the device</b> <br><br>  In general, I received Dawn, he came in a large box, inside it was a mass of film with pimples (my wife and I were very pleased with this entertainment) and another smaller box in which the device itself was already located.  Here is the box: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/eeeb15b3/57a503ec/8f133ce2/c041d4d2.jpg"><br><br>  When unpacking, it turned out that it included the alarm clock itself, the network adapter, and the antenna to the FM radio (I somehow didn‚Äôt pay attention to the fact that there is also a radio in the alarm clock, so I was surprised by the wire).  Radio, as it turned out, normally works without an antenna.  Oh yeah, there was also an instruction that occupies both sides of an A4 leaf. <br><br>  At first I decided to torment the device without instructions.  Everything was going well, I found that the alarm clock can be used as a normal night light, thankfully, the brightness of the lamp allows.  Here, an interesting point is the way to turn on the lamp - for this, simply press the top of it, and the light comes on to a pre-set level (the luminosity level can be adjusted, yes).  To turn off the light, you need to repeat the pressing operation again. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/3df90e05/6b1cfb34/9455a447/bea2d975.png"><br><br>  There are function buttons on the right, left and bottom of the display that are responsible for adjusting the sound volume, adjusting the brightness of the luminaire, switching sound channels and radio, controlling the display backlight, checking the alarm mode (testing the settings previously set), timer, enter button in the menu and, respectively, the control buttons for the menu functions, the alarm off button / exit from the settings menu.  There are a lot of buttons, and I had to refer to the instructions to clarify the ability to control some functions. <br><br>  As for the alarm clock itself.  A device can ‚Äútalk‚Äù with different ‚Äúvoices‚Äù, i.e.  The set of sounds for the alarm clock is as follows: the murmur of a brook, the voice of a bird, the croaking of a frog, the sound of water running onto the sea shore and FM radio. <br><br>  Also found that the system has two different, independent from each other, software alarms.  A great option for a family consisting of two people.  In my case, the device thanks to this function turned out to be useful for the wife, who gets up an hour and a half later than me. <br><br>  <b>Testing</b> <br><br>  Having indulged in the evening with different settings, I set the alarm for my usual wake-up time, checked the alarm mode using the appropriate button and went to bed.  In the morning, for some reason, I woke up from a sound signal in complete darkness, and only after some time it began to ‚Äúget light‚Äù.  Honestly, this alarming behavior caused me some confusion - because what kind of an imitation of dawn is this, when at first the birds start to fill up, and then only the sun rises? <br><br>  It turned out that, due to inattention, I forgot to set the time of the ‚Äúdawn‚Äù itself, that is, the time of switching on the luminaire, which is gradually gaining luminosity level.  By the time the beep should sound, the luminaire must have reached the maximum set brightness.  You can set the time to start raising the brightness level to 15/30/45/60/75/90 minutes before the beep starts.  It is this technique that allows the body's biological clock to respond, which perceives a gradual increase in the level of illumination as the onset of daylight.  As mentioned above, the <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259C%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD">sleep hormone</a> is blocked, and the sleep phases begin to ‚Äúshrink‚Äù until full awakening. <br><br>  As mentioned above, the brightness level of the alarm lamp can be adjusted.  In total there are 20 steps, the last level is enough to read, if you are close to the lamp. <br><br>  Yes, the sound for the waves seemed to be the best for waking sound.  My wife chose him too, we decided not to get up to the sound of the radio, and the singing of birds, the croaking of frogs also decided not to use.  But the young parents may use the murmur of the streamlet, maybe your child will be able to wake up easily under this signal? <br><br>  I tested ‚ÄúDawn‚Äù for about two weeks, and it really became easier to get up.  I open my eyes without any problems, and, as it is not surprising, there is no desire to postpone the sound of the alarm signal for another five minutes (there is such a function here, you just have to click on the corresponding button).  A couple of minutes after I wake up, I get up, and is already quite ready for my morning coffee intake session (coffee doesn't help me wake up much, I just like the smell and taste of different types of coffee drinks).  Previously, you had to come around after half an hour, if not more.  Time was really a pity, but it did not work out differently. <br><br>  Perhaps, you say, it became easier for me to get up due to the placebo effect?  It can be the same, but personally I don‚Äôt care what works here - whether the physiology really works, or whether I convinced myself of the effectiveness of the device.  The main thing - it all works, and works well.  Yes, and the function of the lamp came in handy - I turn on the ‚ÄúDawn‚Äù in the evening and read a little, I like this lamp more than the fluorescent lamp that was used for evening reading sessions before. <br><br>  <b>Device cons</b> <br><br>  I have already described the advantages above, there are enough of them, it‚Äôs not worth re-listing.  There are also disadvantages: <br>  <i>- it is not clear why, in the instructions, there is no description of how the device can be turned on before the sound signal starts to work (and this is one of the most important functions).</i>  <i>Instead, it is indicated that there is an ‚Äúautomatic shutdown timer‚Äù that is configurable for those 15/30/45/60/75/90 minutes.</i>  <i>Maybe the words "on" and "off" are simply confused?</i>  <i>Because of this lack, I could not set the alarm correctly on the first night.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>- the alarm clock is on my smooth horizontal surface, and when you press some buttons, if you gently press them, the device sometimes slides.</i>  <i>I applied the button quickly and hard, then everything was ok.</i> <br><br>  That's all I wanted to share with you.  I hope that this information will help you get up easier in the morning and you. <br><br>  Yes, Master Kit has <a href="http://dadget.ru/autors/%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr.ru%26utm_medium%3Dreferral%26utm_campaign%3Dsvetobudilnik">other devices</a> , among them there are many more that were not described on Habr√©.  If anyone wants to describe something, contact the guys from the company, maybe they will give you a device to be torn apart. <br><br>  PS In order to be able to read reviews of devices from Master Kit, just click on the heart <img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/d06e5978/d17229e2/0311fabd/189c6fbc.png">  in <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/masterkit/">the company profile</a> , and also tick the blog in the settings of <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/">your feed</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/132791/">https://habr.com/ru/post/132791/</a></p>
