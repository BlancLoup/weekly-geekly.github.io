  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Budget and Severe - My MX650 Base Anti-Crash Underbid</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  This post dedicated to my modest two-wheeled division was inspired by several posts about electric transport projects that flashed at the end of 2014 (and early 2015) in the vast Habra-giko-space.  Although, rather, these posts inspired me to rethink my modest electrotransport achievement in the context of a shortage of time and financial resources from an anti-crisis perspective. <br><br>  Actually, under the cut, you will not find a multi-kiloblock mega-project created from scratch with titanium spatial frames and carbon-plastic covers ... And let it be from an engineering and technological point of view - my project is probably a little less dull than a trolleybus from a loaf.  But it can be visual and informative as living proof of the possibility of achieving some result in the conditions of an ultra-compact budget and a permanent shortage of time. <br><br>  So, then we will talk about what I managed to do for the outgoing horse 2014th year from the semi-toy electromotive Razor Dirt Rocket MX650, which is popular overseas, and some creative plans for 2015.

At that time, translated into evergreens, this miracle of electrical engineering cost about $ 650.  That, in principle, is not fatally higher than the four-pack Amazon and four-hundred-and-one Ibeev price tags relevant at the time.  For comparison - on the already expensive serious electric cars like Brammo and Zero, domestic price tags are usually 2-2.5 times higher than European and American ones. <br><br>  Regarding the category of this shipping gadget - the topic is rather ambiguous.  Therefore, in order not to hurt anyone's vulnerable motochevstv I will continue to adhere to the term ‚Äúunderbike‚Äù, since the naming of this miracle (even with mini- and electric prefixes) crossbike / pitbike / dirtbike sometimes overreacts the fragile vanity of petrol motorcars of the corresponding off-road categories. <br><br>  Actually, the official performance characteristics of the stock MX650 do not particularly shine: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Speed ‚Äã‚Äãup to 17mph (approx. 27 km / h) <br>  ‚Ä¢ Maximum weight of a rider 220 lbs (about a centner) <br>  ‚Ä¢ Mileage from one charge - 10 miles (approximately 16 km) <br>  ‚Ä¢ Wheels - front 16 "(40.5 cm) and rear 14" (35.5 cm) dirt tires with cameras <br>  ‚Ä¢ Front ammovilka (IMHO, it is very short-stroke) and rear shock absorber. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Collector motor (MY1020 on 36V 650W) with high-torque chain transmission. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Rotary knob for power control <br>  ‚Ä¢ High gear ratio for uphill and off-road pokatushek <br>  ‚Ä¢ Double sided plug <br>  ‚Ä¢ Reliable Dirtbaykov geometry <br>  ‚Ä¢ Folding foot tights <br>  ‚Ä¢ Pig bags included <br>  ‚Ä¢ Charger and assembly tool included <br>  ‚Ä¢ Dimensions - 56 "x 24.5" x 36 "(approximately 142cm x 62cm x 92cm) <br>  ‚Ä¢ Weight - 100 lbs (about 45.4 kg) <br>  ‚Ä¢ Longevity - up to 40 minutes of intensive use <br>  ‚Ä¢ Battery charging time - up to 8 hours <br>  ‚Ä¢ Battery - 36V (three for 12V) lead acid <br>  ‚Ä¢ Electric motor - 650w (MY1020 is tightly bolted to the rear pendulum) <br>  ‚Ä¢ Seat height - 25 "(approx 64cm) <br><br>  But the data is not particularly embarrassed me, because  I deliberately took my shortage with a preliminary calculation on finishing.  Obviously, in stock form, the applicability of this miracle is rather limited.  But given the price tag - the device is not so uh and bad. <br><br>  So, comparing the balance on the pros / cons and having a toad, I order a subject.  This uncomplicated way last February I became the proud owner of a small box in half a centner weight.  The box lay safely until mid-March, when it was possible to carve out the moment for a distinctive unboxing and assembly of this electric transport gadget: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/a9yrzNU_Qcg%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700021,15700043,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhf3ph92Gd3NJNky6T7sxT6MaCPMQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  In principle, the assembly ... more precisely, the assembly is quite primitive and did not cause any special difficulties, since all the necessary tools and instructions were present. <br><br>  Paying much attention to the safety of the movement process, I decided to change the brakes with the first upgrade to Avid BB7 - they were very pleased with the electric scooter after the runoff.  Fortunately, good mechanical brakes are relatively inexpensive compared to hydraulics - last week BB7 cost me about $ 70 per package. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/JUOq9ofBOmM%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700021,15700043,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhggTtvpINENt9GtBAqvs2qtCeCm7w" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  I thought to replace the calipers and rotors, but I had to restrict myself to calipers only.  The rotors, though with six-screw fasteners, but in both cases the fastening holes differ in the distance to the center.  Calipers were installed on stock rotors - the rear one was installed without problems, and the front had to rub in the pads, since the front rotor was somewhat thicker and had a diameter. <br><br>  The rest had to be postponed until the autumn, rolling the summer in this form: <br><br>  The first autorun trip on this unit on Click: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/f8XAIk61iFE%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700021,15700043,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhg0fKXA1QxPxuKEqA68lDXJJ4bpnA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  The first offroad ride through Izmailovsky Park: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/tC-ZpsRgImM%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700021,15700043,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgcl8dHjpnVYmVIdTy2eiRJbq_Aww" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  First trip in difficult urban conditions from Semenovskaya to Preobrazhenka: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/8kIDm5FwrEM%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700021,15700043,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgHNnQHSmooC7vxWLuBi30Lu-UGnA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  It felt like after the electric scooter was quite comfortable, but very slowly.  A sort of "turtle extreme".  (For comparison, the scooter in my current configuration on asphalt is almost one and a half times faster).  Well, in terms of overall dimensions, it is still rather small for visibility on the roadway, which is not the best factor in terms of security.  Accordingly, as a means of transportation for major highways in stock, it is practically unsuitable.  But a ride through the forest park or in the office to cut around is quite funny. <br><br>  Unfortunately, I really don't have much experience with real off-road or dirts-tracks, so I have enough adrenaline from the forest park so far.  Well, as for driving on asphalt roads, it is rather not a cake. <br><br>  Regarding ergonomics drive - MX650 after the electric scooter is almost fabulous.  Landing is more convenient, the steering wheel does not sausage on each small fossa / hummock, the vibration from the road surface is much less noticeable, the position of the hands is more natural.  For short trips this is certainly not critical, but when you drive about 30 km per day - the difference is quite impressive. <br><br>  Further, in November, it was possible to change the stock lead batteries to 36V LiFePo4 assembly from headway cells: <br><br>  Actually, the new battery at 36v10Ah was purchased in advance in the summer at Moscow retail and cost about $ 450 with two charges: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/3buJ_FurK-c%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700021,15700043,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhic7N6cZ7raw2HxtX2IM5PU9lhv6g" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  The dismantling of the casing did not cause any particular difficulties, although taking into account the fact that the batteries are not eternal, the designer could have implemented a more convenient design: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/cW3NYnd3REg%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700021,15700043,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhj6oFhZw_xfsjJM4N0zNEI9YsmmWA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  When replacing the battery, I did not want to bother with high-ampere connectors, but it was not an option for collective farms with twists, so I decided to resort to self-clamping wago-terminal blocks: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/LNpaxSpkRbY%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700021,15700043,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjfqCTklkUdCOuNwDSCedUXZaGvfA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  As I understand it, thick discharge wires in a black braid and thin charging wires in a yellow braid are paralleled - respectively, to minimize the number of connections and charge and discharge connected to thick wires.  Thin wires are left as a reserve for the future - they will be useful if I put the second battery in parallel or in sequence. <br><br>  Accum in the frame space rammed abutly and mounting the back cover was not so trivial.  But fortunately, a little napinga help me out: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/ngOekH0MC-0%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700021,15700043,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhg-vPIgdgc4EFMgD_TUjEIuf5_WGA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  After switching from lead to a lifter, my shortage improved by about 7‚Äì8 kilos and acquired the superpower of winter driving, which I was able to experience in early December with an epic racing on paving snow porridge: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/Cq7ZgbnVc-M%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700021,15700043,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhiqu32lWoPhCsLCRYCx3anzRrRhHA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  The weather, of course, was specific, and in the absence of winterizing skills, Aki Arctic turtles wove, but the end of winter is not soon - maybe I'll catch up on the part of the snowdrift. <br><br>  I am not proud of the result achieved, but I am already satisfied.  In total, this vehicle took about 1,250 evergreen raccoons.  As a killerphic, compactness, low weight, all-weather capability, the possibility of a trailing movement and the absence of the need for any categories of rights can be noted.  The last point is probably not debatable ... But the subject formally belongs to the category of toys and gadgets, which in theory equates a rider to a pedestrian and makes the requirement of rights absurd. <br><br>  And then I plan to finish for real use - in the near future a high wheel, high ammort, light fixtures, a lock.  Perhaps even (temporarily) winter tires and other wings.  In the long term, it is planned to replace or upgrade the plug, switch to a besklelektornik, controller Mini-E and the second battery in a sequence up to 72v, change the casing, plastic, saddle.  In general, the Napoleonic creative plans, I hope, and the technical capabilities will not fail. <br><br>  ps: <i>and on the eve of the old-new:</i> <br><br><blockquote>  Happy New Year, Comrades! <br>  So Akum holds charges <br>  So as not to let down the frame, <br>  And not in a kilo. <br><br>  Do not miss everyone in the offseason ... <br>  Or in a climate of buffalo - <br>  So that winter was ezdat, <br>  All LiFerrum Phosphate! </blockquote></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/375417/">https://habr.com/ru/post/375417/</a></p>
