Part II: Your Personal Media</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In this part of the material we will discuss the topic of " <b>personal media</b> ".  In part I was proposed a different from the usual interpretation of the ‚Äúpersonal media‚Äù - as <b>your personal channel of influence</b> on your environment.  In part II we will consider the <b>technocratic</b> tools and aspects of the growth of your influence that have become available today with the development of new technologies. <br><br>  PS For the technocrats, dreamers, to whom we also include ourselves, sleeping and seeing when AI (artificial intelligence) will become a serious assistant to mankind, today an interesting story happened.  Intellectual self-learning <b>chat bot Tay</b> , developed by Microsoft, learned ‚Äúeverything bad‚Äù from people (more in Russian <a href="https://meduza.io/shapito/2016/03/24/iskusstvennyy-intellekt-ot-microsoft-za-sutki-polyubil-gitlera-i-voznenavidel-feministok">here</a> ) and bot, in the end, plugged their mouths with the first pancake.  So, of course, it is possible and necessary to hope for technology, but it‚Äôs also necessary to attach your own head to your fame. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c0d/9b0/f70/c0d9b0f704dc402290cdb97fc447f733.gif">

      So, 3 simple steps that _ help_ (and not make you lazy for you) become more influential / noticeable / respected / useful for your environment: <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <i>1. Choose your expert niche and set up thematic monitoring tools</i> <i><br></i>  <i>2. We launch and _accompany_ (we are not lazy!) Operational information channel</i> <i><br></i>  <i>3. We monitor and react to discussions - after all, are you an expert or who?</i> <br><br>  <b>I. Nisshew and listen</b> <br><br>  You are an individual.  Unicum  Single mother.  You can work in a huge multinational corporation of Evil / Good / Dummy, but always and everywhere in your environment you are perceived as an independent person.  One piece.  Parental billions, cool cars and clothes, super corporate PR plume, and even an MBA diploma are all good only in the phase of dating and ‚Äúsmelling‚Äù.  And then there comes a life-long phase, and here you won't spend anybody on the chaff - you or an interesting (to someone, in something, somewhere) personality, or ... just a good person :-) <br><br>  1. Since we are talking about our informational "I", we limit ourselves to the informational interest of others.  Does anyone know you as a know-it-all?  Well, unless your absolutely small children.  <b>We are loners, and, therefore, automatically - limited</b> : I do not know Swahili, how many ships are there in the Pacific Ocean, who is the president of New Zealand (is there a president there?), Etc.  It means that your environment does not expect that you will start to drive the ‚Äúcontent wave‚Äù about everything in the world. <br><br>  2. Everyone has access to the Internet and public information archives.  No one will understand if you start <b>loading people with a</b> million articles from Wikipedia or ‚Äúbutton accordions‚Äù with bearded anecdotes.  And then, after all, a bath and a ban are our national everything :-) <br><br>  3. Look at yourself, look inside, look carefully: <b>WHAT are you interested in</b> ?  Only without snag.  Found nothing?  This does not happen.  Remember when and who listens to you carefully.  WHAT you say, not HOW, namely WHAT.  Drop emotions (of course, it‚Äôs also interesting to other subjects, but it‚Äôs counter-productive strategically);  jokes and jokes can be left only if half of them are your own and not only you and your faithful dog laugh at them;  ‚ÄúHow I spent my day‚Äù your grandmother is very interested - by the way, the audience too! .. In general, think, remember, think again, watch yourself and your communications again, and try, do not hesitate.  You are a kind person, and you are surrounded by kind people too.  If your content does not like others, then change.  By the way, you can change others: for example, one of our materials on BigData was placed on Megamind and on Habr√© - the result was positively met by one environment and mined in the other.  It is important to draw conclusions :-) <br><br>  4. Let us rearrange the sentences of the wisest phrase of the smartest Eleanor Roosevelt: <br>  <i>"Small minds discuss people"</i> <i><br></i>  <i>"Average minds - discuss events"</i> <i><br></i>  <i>"Great minds - discuss ideas."</i> <i><br></i> <br>  Conclusions that do not necessarily agree, the main thing is that you have your own: <br><br>  <b>A.</b> If you are interested in a specific <b>IDEA</b> - this is a topic for ‚Äúpersonal media‚Äù, a global theme is ‚Äúfor life‚Äù.  It is great if it correlates with work / study / hobby / obtaining-knowledge - it means that the time of ‚Äúwiping your pants‚Äù will not be lost, and collecting stamps / airplanes is also an important piece of your unique life. <br><br>  <b>B.</b> If you are interested in and concentrating on <b>LOCAL (events / situations)</b> - then start accumulating facts: data, materials, photos, videos - and form your expertise with _ the <b>dynamics of</b> _ processes.  Having data and understanding the dynamics of development of processes - you become an expert, forming your own added knowledge, which allows you to make "far-reaching forecasts."  You from the repeater of the past or the current (about which others can already learn from other sources) become a generator of new knowledge, potentially - a predictor - "predicting the future."  By the way, the new anecdote - to something that has emerged again - is also a wonderful example of generation. <br><br>  <b>Q.</b> If people are interested in you <b>, the lives of others</b> are a difficult topic.  Perhaps you will become someone's biographer, but this is definitely not about this article.  Psychology is a great science, but not about our honor. <br><br>  For our own example, we will focus on <b>‚ÄúPlan B‚Äù</b> - information flows and social media are simply born for this direction.  And the example used at the beginning ( <i>PS about Tay</i> ) is an excellent illustration of this: our environment has become interested in the new dynamic and read it to this place - after all, Megamind is really needed to break the AI ‚Äã‚Äãbrains, right?  :-) <br><br>  Modern humanity spends a lot of time consuming information.  Information becomes more and more, the need for filtering is growing: we limit the number of TV channels, magazines, Internet sites, social network groups, subscription accounts.  Content generators, on the contrary, try to expand the audience, which leads either (more often) to the expansion of the topics offered to readers, or (less often, forcedly) to narrowing the topic with deeper study of the topic and building up expertise. <br><br>  By the way, as a result of such oppositely directed processes, there was a change in the paradigm of information retrieval in the late 90s: when there were few websites and they were essentially thematic (they were created by specific business structures with expertise in a particular area), then the Internet resource catalogs , such as <b>Yahoo and the Catalog Rambler or ‚ÄúAy!‚Äù</b> , were much more in demand than the search engines of that time - <b>Yandex or AltaVista</b> .  Now it is even difficult to imagine.  And Google / Yandex will undoubtedly still take some time to lead in the search for <b>real-time and ‚Äúreal-time‚Äù information</b> , gradually being squeezed towards the <b>‚Äúarchival‚Äù search</b> (either that was or always). <br><br>  To get used to the role, from "we" go to the "I", the individual, 1 piece.  So, I chose " <b>Plan B</b> " - I create a personal (personal, personal) thematic media that will inform my small circle with useful and new information.  Since I love and to some extent know (or so it seems to me) the field of social media, I am interested in aspects of the influence of social media on humanity, the impact on the old and the creation of new areas of business, it is logical to create a media channel on the topic with a loud name like " <b>Social Media &amp; World</b> ". <br><br>  Understanding perfectly well that my surroundings are also drowning in information, affairs and worries, but at the same time I have <b>to</b> build up expertise in my work, then I will follow the path of least resistance in choosing a utility path for people: <b>promptly choose</b> industrial ‚Äúgoodies‚Äù and trend materials, <b>form a</b> thematic <b>binding</b> , <b>generate conclusions</b> and issue to the channel of its media. <br><br>  Thus, I hope that as a result of this experiment I will: <br>  <i>1. Build up <b>your own expertise</b> in a thematic niche;</i> <i><br></i>  <i>2. Help <b>smart people to</b> be aware of the development of the industry by publishing the latest information;</i> <i><br></i>  <i>3. To form your <b>positive image</b> - a connoisseur with a wide heart (interesting self-deception, isn‚Äôt it?);</i> <i><br></i>  <i>4. To be able to <b>form your thoughts</b> correctly (who will start wasting time on a dropout graphomaniac);</i> <i><br></i>  <i>5. <b>To find relationships</b> between events, situations and interweaving between different objects and spheres of life;</i> <i><br></i>  <i>6. <b>Make predictions</b> .</i>  <i>This is the most difficult, but the most important thing.</i>  <i>The experts are asked to explain the underlying processes and the prediction of development.</i> <i><br></i> <br>  So, I decided with a niche, now, to complete the I-th step (remember about 3 steps?), You need to <b>configure thematic monitoring toolkit</b> . <br><br>  PS I will work with what I have on hand - our platform system - because it is more convenient for me and having a good instruction will save me a lot of time.  Below is a description of the free features that will allow to complete the task well, but you will need to spend a little more time.  In general, as always: time is money. <br><br>  In your chosen topic, as well as in my chosen field, quite a lot of events can occur, the information flow can be gigantic, so you need to correctly configure the ‚Äúnet / net / bait‚Äù - our task is to increase our attractiveness, and not to drown in a huge information flow and not spend a day on the flight filtering "thematic bazaar".  Therefore, the next stage is to play around with the ‚Äúfishing line and fishing line‚Äù and formulate such a <b>filter query</b> , so that the fish of the required size can be caught and the pile will be enough.  But first, let's estimate the volume of thematic flow from which to fish. <br><br>  For filtering, it is logical to take, for example, the word " <i>Facebook</i> " and see the power of the stream.  Since I plan to find and publish the latest information, we can safely restrict the materials _for the last 24 hours.  Here is a screenshot of the search in Yandex: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4dd/d17/238/4ddd1723822349e4a6246e8a90d5324a.gif"><br><br>  It would seem that here it is a ‚Äúgold mine‚Äù - only 2 pages!  Disappointment will come quickly if you look at a more realistic picture of the content flow of people: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/662/60b/34a/66260b34a80641e3827427bd821c20cd.gif"><br><br>  those.  Facebook is mentioned <b>up to 10,000 times per hour</b> !  But there is still VK, Instagram, Twitter, etc., etc. <br>  Omitting a lot of ‚Äúsmart‚Äù thoughts and experiments, I stopped at the following basic query for the monitoring platform used: <br>  <i>‚ÄúNew social‚Äù ~ 0 -found -born -follow -try -join, ‚Äúsocial analytics‚Äù ~ 0, ‚Äúsocial media‚Äù ~ 0</i> <br>  where the sign "~ 0" means an exact match and sequence of words (the distance between the words of 0 other words) inside the quotation marks, and the minus before the word is an indication to filter messages containing this word. <br><br>  As you can see, the request does not mention specific social networks, but there is a high probability of finding materials containing the ‚Äúconsequences‚Äù of using social networks: the formation of new social trends, research results, industrial analysts. <br><br>  <b>Outcome: The first step is completed</b> - a topic is selected and a permanent monitoring is set up, generating ~ <b>1,000 materials per day</b> .  Such a flow of headlines can be easily looked through 2-3 times a day, spending 10 minutes. <br><br>  The promised: for those who have little resources, but enough time to promote themselves, you can advise, for example, the following sequence of actions: <br><br>  1. Use <b>search engines in social networks</b> where they are - on Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn: <br>  a.  To view new posts on your topic (for example, in my case the words: <i>social, analytics, networks</i> ); <br>  b.  To <b>accumulate a list of</b> major foreign experts whose thoughts and ideas interest you, as well as links to materials in thematic blogs and forums. <br><br>  2. The search services themselves, as we have already seen, are not interesting for our task.  But by inquiries through search engines (Google) create a <b>small list of _thematic_ Internet resources</b> that write on your topic.  For my topics, for example: <i>socialmediatoday.com, venturebeat.com, techcrunch.com.</i> <br><br>  3. The list of sites is not needed to visit them.  The correct sites have RSS feeds.  Install on your computer and smartphone a convenient <b>RSS reader</b> for quick viewing <b>and connect</b> the necessary subject sites to it.  I use FeedReader (feedreader.com) in the ‚Äúonly unread‚Äù mode - the list of promos is synchronized for different devices, the ‚Äúfolders‚Äù are easily configured: ‚Äúgood‚Äù resources to one, beginners or ‚Äúso-so‚Äù to another. <br><br>  4. Once a week <b>repeat requests</b> in the search engine - if a useful thematic resource appears, then add your list. <br><br>  If, over time, you suddenly decide to change the paradigm of your media - from popularizing your image among the environment to monetization (often with disrespect and anger of reading - see the same Varlamov.ru), then you may (not) be lucky and you will so popular that you move to another ‚Äúlayer‚Äù: popular bloggers, like-minded groups and editors, who need their own tools and technologies (in the picture - an excerpt from the speech of General Director VK) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d0a/d69/3dc/d0ad693dc376401c9ca4f50d2fda4503.gif"><br><br>  but we'll talk about this in another material. <br><br>  <b>Step 2 - Creating and accompanying your media</b> <b><br></b> <br>  You can organize your info channel in many places: on Facebook, VK, Twitter, Instagram, on your blog or even as a mailing list.  But for my particular case: <br><br>  1. I chose ‚ÄúPlan B‚Äù, which means that the <b>speed of delivery of</b> operational information is important. <br>  2. The most important thing: <b>do not force people</b> to change their habits - if they come to check mail once a week, then ... <br>  3. I also want to get rid of the computer myself and be able to ‚Äúdrive content‚Äù into my media <b>at any time and place</b> . <br>  4. <b>Universality</b> of content receiving <b>devices</b> (computer, tablet, smartphone). <br><br>  This task perfectly "falls" on the field of instant messengers.  And life proves that for operational tasks messengers - the most it.  Yesterday, the Belgian edition <i>Nieuwsblad</i> <a href="http://www.nieuwsblad.be/cnt/dmf20160326_02205315">discovered</a> that on the day of the bombings in Brussels the local police were left without their communication system (in Russian - <a href="http://ria.ru/world/20160326/1397477219.html">here</a> ), and operational communication was conducted through ... <b>WhatsApp</b> . <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/594/d01/e2c/594d01e2c91d40978547b578381f35bb.jpg"><br><br>  In my opinion, the main tsimus is that the safety, and, in fact, illegal from a corporate point of view of management, an information exchange network existed long before the events.  And, as they say, thanks to the technology that helped at the right moment. <br><br>  So the choice was rather in the type of messenger - and it became <b>Telegram</b> : operative, universal, relaxed, habitual for my circle.  Create your channel in Telegram - 3 minutes, of which 2 will go to search for the still unoccupied link. <br><br>  So, the <b><a href="http://telegram.me/soMedia">telegram.me/soMedia</a></b> channel has been created, through Telegram, information has been sent to several people who are professionally involved in social media and who, I hope, will be useful ‚Äúuseful things‚Äù, conclusions and predictions on the impact on humanity and processes in society. <br><br>  Then the routine begins, which should not strain you: your media is your media, first of all for you and your tasks.  If the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãyour info channel is not ‚Äúsucked from the finger‚Äù and not copied from another channel (that is, it is not, in fact, not your idea), then channel management should not be straining.  I still keep and will be monitoring the industry that is interesting to me, important news and interpretations, and now I am sending to other experts - the information always circulates in expert circles - the messenger format for reference and express comment is very convenient, since there is no Twitter limit of 140 characters and the archive of your media (when urgently needed) is always at hand. <br><br>  <b>The result of Step 2</b> : Your media in the form of a channel. The telegrams are created and accompanied, the dynamics and the archive are formed, there is no need to send info to people via different channels, and even grafomanstvo is satisfied.  For your media, choose your own, convenient for you and for your tasks, distribution channel, the example I gave is just a template. <br><br>  <b>The main</b> idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe <b>material</b> is to throw a thought to think at your leisure about changing the paradigm of creating and distributing content in a changing world.  If you want to watch a movie that is interesting to you, then you should not dig in the past (cinema site archives) and opinions of people unknown to you, but send a signal to the human noosphere (bravo prognostic of Vernadsky!) <i>Social</i> media " <i>I want a tearful melodrama / cool-action movie</i> " and get a response from the environment that knows you, a business channel for delivering new films, or an AI bot scanning people's needs.  And for such a (possible) path of social development, as many people as possible should become not only consumers ‚Äú <i>what will they give us on TV / websites,</i> ‚Äù but also experts in a small niche.  We are all individual, and we must learn to show our individuality.  Its media is a good form of study, gaining experience and manifestation of individuality. <br><br>  <b>Step-3: Monitor and respond to discussions</b> <b><br></b> <br>  About this stage, many either do not know, or forget.  For an expert professional, whom you are or are planning to become, such forgetfulness is unacceptable.  Remember yourself or your friends, when something does not work or goes wrong - we turn to the support service, and now often just write on the social network, with the hope of a reaction. <br><br>  The same is true of the experts: in the framework of the IDEA, the person should send a request / complaint / proposal in social media, and get an answer / suggestion / advice.  ‚Äú <i>Advise a smartphone‚Äù, ‚ÄúAt least someone would clean the apartment‚Äù, ‚ÄúHow to cut the claws of a dog‚Äù, ‚ÄúI am going to Museum Night, my number is +7 ...‚Äù</i> - humanity constantly generates questions, requests, suggestions, it is time for humanity itself and answer, offer, accept. <br><br>  As a good example, I will cite a link to the discussion that got into my net of catching situations in social media: meet <b>Dmitry Sidorin</b> , a cool expert and super-active person who does a lot for the social media industry.   ‚Äî   (http://vk.com/wall3144011_1682?reply=1693): <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/729/de1/dfc/729de1dfc51e48968634800c57405011.gif"><br><br>      :   ( ?)     ¬´¬ª    ‚Äî <i>¬´ ¬ª, ¬´  ¬ª, ¬´ ¬ª, ¬´  ¬ª, ¬´ ¬ª, ¬´  ¬ª</i> ‚Ä¶        ‚Ä¶ <b></b> ,      .  . <br><br> PS  : " <i>- ¬´HeadHunter -¬ª ,     70%           "</i> ‚Äî ,              ¬´¬ª.  ,    .        . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/299648/">https://habr.com/ru/post/299648/</a></p>
