However, this is fate, because if not us, then who?  But personally, I could not convince myself with the help of conventional stamps that this is true.  I really did not like this job.  But this is Krishna’s contribution to the expedition, and too much depended on it. <br><br>  We did the work quickly.  Soon it will become quite commonplace to connect electrodes to different nerves, one, two and back to the native gateway, wash off the mucus!  But, nevertheless, we are both grateful to Ivanov, who made us thinking and feeling iron, almost people.  This is especially clear when looking at the piece of iron Sidorov.  And if you imagine that you couldn’t have been thought out and collected at all, then it becomes very bad, it’s better to swim forever in mucus and wash it twenty times a day ...

      But enough about the sad, we complement the people, and they complement us.  This science is called symbiosis.  And while everyone does what he can best, we have hope for success.  The case is left for small.  Ilyin in the period dragged his universal translator and stuck the cord into the speaker connector. <br><br>  “Now you can proceed,” he reported to Ivanov in the period. <br><br>  - Everyone in the chair and buckle up!  - ordered Ivanov.  - And then suddenly the reaction will not be adequate.  Imagine that the supra-boy slap his ear when we turn to him. <br><br>  “We are all ready,” Yu-Fu-Fyn replied. <br><br>  - Hi stranger!  - gave Ivanov a microphone. <br><br>  The picture on the screen stopped. <br><br>  - He heard us!  - rejoiced Sidorov. <br><br>  “We must speak more slowly,” advised the Agent, “perhaps for him this is too high a speed of negotiations.” <br><br>  - Hi stranger!  We are representatives of a great civilization, ”Ivanov continued, trying to speak as slowly as possible.  - This is not a hallucination, we just connected a sensor to your ear in order to talk to you.  If you can hear us, please respond. <br><br>  - Of course, I hear voices in my brain.  I believed that the supercivilization had chosen to contact me, a simple techie who watches this fusion metal.  I'm afraid I have to go to a psychiatrist.  No, perhaps you should not start with heavy artillery - I will begin with a psychotherapist. <br><br>  - The psychotherapist is preferable, but maybe we'll manage on our own. <br><br>  - Strange.  The voice answers quite logically.  Hey, you there, what do you need from me? <br><br>  - We have established contact with you because you are the first person we met, and also because you may be the one who can help us. <br><br>  - If you are a different civilization, then how do we generally speak and understand each other, because our languages ​​should be very different? <br><br>  - We speak through a universal translator.  I am afraid that only my colleague who invented it can tell the details. <br><br>  - Not worth the details on the translator.  Better explain what you want?  Have you decided to conquer our world? <br><br>  - Ha!  We also have a philistine stuffed with such nonsense in cheap science fiction films: "Ugly monsters fell from the sky and immediately began to miss the sexiest beauties."  The question is, why the hell these monsters are the most sexy beauties.  Certainly not for sex!  But seriously, our Universe is dying, and we need another.  And it is true. <br><br>  - So you want our universe?  Then I should not help you!  I am not a traitor. <br><br>  - I said: we need a new Universe, but did not say that it is yours.  Your universe does not suit us, it is too cold for us. <br><br>  - And what temperature do you need? <br><br>  - The temperature of the solar corona.  But there is too much pressure in the sun, and this also does not suit us. <br><br>  - Then I'm completely confused.  I do not see how I could help you.  I'm a modest ordinary technical specialist.  I'm afraid you need someone much more powerful.  Perhaps you should contact our government, but I don’t understand how it could help your trouble. <br><br>  - Tell a stranger, if it was in your power, would you help us? <br><br>  - You are definitely not conquerors? <br><br>  - We are refugees.  And you created our civilization, and you are going to destroy it. <br><br>  - How is this possible?  As far as I know, our civilization cannot create other civilizations.  If only they had time to solve their problems.  Here's a look at thermonuclear installations.  A quarter of them are frank trash, only a quarter of the new ones, and the rest are morally obsolete, and physically too.  Here at least this one - and he kicked our TOKAMAK foot. <br><br>  - Be careful!  - shouted Ilyin.  - In the same place people live! <br><br>  - Who can live there?  There's a temperature ... Yeah!  I seem to be beginning to understand!  So a great civilization lives in a reactor!  It is very funny!  Now I believe you that you are not conquerors. <br><br>  - Believe is good.  How about help?  We need to move to another reactor, only a new one, and with a continuous cycle of work.  Yes, we ourselves have such reactors with a continuous cycle, we can give you a design.  And we need time to prepare.  And also your help, because you can transfer us to another reactor. <br><br>  - We also have such - with a continuous cycle of work - those that are new and should replace this junk.  And I also want to clarify about the integrity of the reactor: is that microcrack your job? <br><br>  - We are sorry, but we had no other choice.  In another way, we could not get into your world.  The crack formed itself, but we expanded it a little so that it was possible to fly. <br><br>  - So, you are now sitting in my head, or rather in the ear? <br><br>  - Yes, if this is unpleasant for you, then as soon as you help us, we will immediately leave you alone.  You understand that we just want to save our civilization. <br><br>  - Ok, I'll help you.  You can prepare for the great relocation.  They brought a new reactor.  Soon it will install, download and make a test run.  And then run forever.  When it is launched, your “Universe” will have to be stopped, since a new reactor will also be installed at this place.  I can not affect the timing, and therefore you have to hurry. <br><br>  - And we would like to look around in the new universe. <br><br>  - Do you know what Ivanov?  - said Yu-Fu-Fyn, - I think that it’s best to hurry and warn our base about what we managed to find out.  After all, preparation will take a lot of time, whether it is a joke - to resettle the Universe!  Zeno, write them on the Internet connection. <br><br>  - Alas, General, I have already written, there is no answer. <br><br>  “This is all a quantum polymer with which the TOKAMAK shell lattice is filled.  No waves pass through it, everything dissipates, ”said Ilyin. <br><br>  - I agree, colleague.  We can only fly. <br><br>  “Let's do this: Krishna and I will stay in touch here.”  Sit in this little Mirolaz, wait for you.  At least, as soon as you re-enter the supra-world, you will contact our great friend through us. <br><br>  “The agent is talking,” the general supported the subordinate.  - And he needs to stay: he is specially prepared for sitting in ambushes, dark and cramped rooms.  And in the company of Krishna, he will easily wait for us. <br><br>  - Besides, I will get to know the supra-boyfriend better, and, hopefully, we will be friends. <br><br>  - Before heading back, I would like to discuss this question: what if something does not work out, can we get into another reactor? <br><br>  - I do not see a fundamental problem.  I promised to help you because I consider our civilization responsible for you, because we created the Universe in which you appeared.  Yes, and I think that I should not report this to my superiors, or else they will declare me insane, and this is of no use to me.  And even if they believe me, then trouble can also come out: the powerful of this world so love to twist the arms of those who are weaker.  And you are definitely weaker and depend on us completely.  So it is better not to tell them. <br><br>  - We, too, it was so, until a united government appeared. <br><br>  - You have the whole galaxy united!  This is great! <br><br>  - Alas, no, only half.  The second half is commanded by the Dargonians, our long-time rivals and enemies.  Although the situation has improved with them: we have not been fighting for a long time and exchanged ambassadors. <br><br>  - I want to warn you that I only work here, that is, I am not all the time.  And when I do not work, I am in different places, including at home.  In the presence of other people of my world, I cannot speak with you, and I can only help when I am here.  I do not advise you to make contact with others, as not all of us will help you.  Yes, my name is - and we heard, however, as before, something not intelligible, but a universal translator issued: Joe. <br><br>  “Very nice, Joe.”  My name is Ivan, my colleague Ilya, and our robot - Zeno.  Agent and robot Krishna remain in touch with you.  And we are flying home now.  There must be a lot of preparatory work.  I hope we will succeed.  We need to get inside the reactor, and we are not able to move in the “microcrack” against the headwind. <br><br>  - I'll help you.  Get out and fly to the thermometer, I will stick it into the reactor at the command of the Agent, I hope you have a connection with it. <br><br>  - Thank!  See you, Joe! <br><br>  - I wish you good luck, Ivan! <br><br>  And so, we are in our native universe.  The first thing I did was write a detailed letter to Sergey Sergeevich.  Yu-Fu-Fyn read, approved and put his digital signature, thus making it an official report.  From himself he attributed the need to evacuate the universe as soon as possible. <br><br>  Sergey Sergeevich unsubscribed that he understood, accepted and sent to the very top of the Rear Admiral.  And I wrote that we fly to them in almost full composition.  Ilyin again calculated a gravitationally balanced trajectory, I sat down in the first pilot's seat, everyone dived into the capsules of gravity freezing, and as soon as they worked, I started.  I will not describe the details, because everything happened in the reverse order. <br><br>  The return trip lasted the same week subjectively.  When we went through our star sector - it was often shake.  I was gradually slowing down, and by the time our ion engines left in Pluto orbit loomed ahead, we were already flying at normal light speed.  We did not have time to finish the docking with the engines, e-mail rang.  I had to go check: <br><br>  <i>Major General Yu-Fu-Fynu, urgent, secret.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>General, in the application is the cipher from the very top, with the stamp of Sov.</i>  <i>secretly.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Sergey Sergeevich.</i> <br><br>  It was a heavy blow below the belt.  However, what am I talking about, I do not have a belt, and the one below.  It's a shame only secrets from me.  I had to complete the docking procedure for ionic engines, turn on the autopilot and set the course home.  I immediately took to wake the crew.  You do not need to have a lot of mind to guess - I woke the general first, suddenly something important in the cipher.  In the meantime, he was warming himself with tea there and deciphering the letter, began to work on the rest, one by one, in order, according to established tradition.  I already had the experience, and I strongly condensed the schedule of awakening. <br><br>  As soon as Ivanov and Ilyin became minimally efficient, the general acquainted them with the contents of the encryption.  They left to whisper into the sleeping compartment, and when they got out of there, Ilyin sat down at the supercomputer and re-calculated our course.  By that time, I had already awakened Sidorov and supplied him with an unlimited supply of hot coffee with milk, of course artificial, because I couldn’t put a cow in Mirolaz. <br><br>  “Attention, the general must make a statement,” announced Ilyin. <br><br>  “Gentlemen,” he began, without making an exception for robots, which raised my status and respect for myself, “we are not going home.”  An order came from Rear Admiral to come to him urgently! <br><br><h2>  Chapter Ten - The Big Bosses </h2><br>  The rear admiral was located on the metropolitan planet of the sector, and the flight to her was in order. <br><br>  “Zenon, now you will understand what it means to travel between the stars, and how much more difficult it is to rush between galaxies along a gravitationally balanced trajectory,” Ilyin said in the period. <br><br>  “Is there really no easy way,” I asked. <br><br>  - Now we calculate the gravitational-tense trajectory, and the autopilot will lead us along it, explained Ivanov in the period. <br><br>  - You know, I somehow do not really like the very name of this trajectory.  Why can not pave balanced.  I crossed the floor of the Universe twice along such a trajectory, and nowhere did I even shake. <br><br>  “This happens because when you fly around the galaxy, Mirolaz has plenty of room to maneuver, and flying around ten to fifteen extra parsecs is compensated by the fact that we do not change speed, and it is, in this case, the maximum possible.  Due to this, all the forces on the trajectory are balanced, and you rush in an empty space so smoothly that you do not notice the movement itself. <br><br>  - Ilyin is absolutely right.  But inside the galaxy such a trajectory is possible only with subluminal speeds.  And we are in a hurry, the big authorities are waiting for us, and the Universe must be hurriedly saved.  So you have to fly faster than the speed of light.  And this means that a smooth trajectory will not work, and it will consist of several segments of straight lines, which are interconnected by turning parabolas.  These parabolas cannot be passed on hyperdraves alone - there is not enough attraction from the stars that we fly around, and such lateral forces arise that will carry us far to the side, and at the same time you can crash into any neighboring star. <br><br>  - I think I understand, chief!  It's like a Formula 1 race - you need to brake before a sharp turn, otherwise the car will take out the road and bang around the side! <br><br>  - Well done, Zeno.  I did not know that you are interested in racing, but you caught the essence.  And if you continue your analogy, then you know that cornering in Formula 1 on the rider and the car overload act.  So it is on turning parabolas.  And, in order not to fly away from the trajectory, we will have to turn on ionic engines in order to compensate for the lateral forces, but the arc never works out ideally, and this results in a solid overload due to the fact that the ship pulls, then into one the side. <br><br>  - But maybe we will slow down? <br><br>  - Of course, let's slow down, but still it must be high, otherwise we will arrive in the next century.  Now I will finish with the trajectory, and we will again settle into capsules.  This will make the flight path as rigid and fast as possible.  And this can only withstand robots. <br><br>  *** <br><br>  Mirolaz entered the first turning parabola, and hell immediately began.  For a moment, a terrible vibration from the ion-powered engines turned on at full capacity.  Such shaking does not happen even when landing on the planet, but we still continued to demolish.  Hyperdrive support was required, but they worked with a long delay, such is the nature of hyperdrive.  And when they were turned on, they had to accelerate them to the maximum mode in order to keep the trajectory and the total thrust had to be adjusted by ion engines in order to keep at least approximately on a parabolic curve.  It seemed that the resulting shaking would shake everything out of me, even the iron special forces were shaking so that they clicked with steel toothless jaws, and at such moments, deep in their mouths, it was possible to consider the barrel of the ion cannon. <br><br>  The computer placed our real trajectory on the monitor on the ideal one calculated by Ilyin, and the first prong appeared on it.  Now the engines overtook the demolition, and we crossed the perfect trajectory.  The curve jumped in the other direction, the ion engines almost turned off, the vibration subsided, but this happiness did not last long.  The first internal prong appeared on the trajectory, and we were again carried away.  Ion engines turned on at full power, shaking and overloading, even worse than before, piled on us. <br><br>  When it was all over and I came to my senses, I saw on the screen a path in the form of a saw superimposed on the smooth curve of a parabola.  The middle part was the most intense, and I remembered it vaguely, as my brain rebooted four times from such vibrations and overloads.  I, just in case, went to check the capsules, it was hard to believe that everything worked out.  But the capsules were intact, and people are alive.  And it was only the first of three, turning parabola! <br><br>  It was still that flight.  I do not want to describe it because these unpleasant memories still make my electronic synapses tremble.  But when it was all over, I complained to Ivanov and Ilyin.  And a miracle happened: both geniuses whispered to honey with themselves, then rushed to the supercomputer to do the calculations.  Only one sleepless night, and in the morning they announced to me that they had invented a gravitational-stabilizing wheelhouse for one robot pilot. <br><br>  “As soon as we arrive at the base of the Rear Admiral,” said Ivanov, “we will make it there and install two such cabins for both pilots.” <br><br>  “In the meantime, we are flying the last straight trajectory,” Ilyin added, “I will work on its structure.”  It should be something like a gravity-freezing capsule, but without immobilization and freezing, it doesn’t need robots, and cutting, unlike capsules, should stand upright. <br><br>  But the end of this terrible flight was near.  We flew for about a week, but what a huge difference: last time we swept through half of the Universe for the same time, bypassing countless galaxies.  And now we have moved to a barely noticeable segment on the galaxy map. <br><br>  *** <br><br>  In the spaceport we were waited by a huge, like a truck, limousine of an unknown to me model, we sat down in it and everything, and everything found a place, there was even a special seat for me.  Our car flew in the direction of the capital, accompanied by a solid guard convoy on armored vehicles.  In our honor, roads and streets in the capital were blocked.  The limousine described a semicircle around the huge palace of the government sector and stopped right in front of the parade escalator.  ,       . <br><br>       ,   .    ,          , .  ,    .      ,          ,     . <br><br>    ,          « , ». <br><br>          ,    .    ,     ,      ,     .      ,        .  ,     ,       .   –      : <br><br> –  !  ? –  ,    . <br><br> –  !   --,    , –    ,       . <br><br>      ,  ,      . <br><br> –   , –  ,      ,   . <br><br>          ,    .         .       .     « ,  ».    ,   ,     . <br><br> –  , . <br><br>    ,  ,       .    , ,      .     ,   ,        ,       .     ,      . <br><br> –        , –    . <br><br> –   , , –    -. –      !      .  , ,  , –    --. <br><br> –  ? <br><br> –   ,   . <br><br>      ,     ,    .     ,    « ». <br><br>        ,   .      ,    -.  -,    (      -  - )     ,   .      .        : <br><br> –    ? <br><br> –   , ,   ,     ,  . <br><br> – ,   ? –  . <br><br>   ,  ,  , ,   .      –       ,       . <br><br> – , .     ,   ,       ,    ,    «   »,  .      .     ,       .     --,      ,    – ,    -,   – ,    -.     ,  .    ,  ,     ,       .    ,     . <br><br> –      ! –  . <br><br> –        ,       ,         .    ! –  . <br><br> –    , –  --, –     ? <br><br> –   .  ,   ?  --. <br><br> –    .      ,   … <br><br> – -, –  . <br><br> –      ,     -   ,   ,      ,   ,       ,   .       ,   .   ,    , ,   ,   .   ,   -       ,         .      -      .       -1     -     ,      ,         -. <br><br> – .   . ,     ,  ,    .  . <br><br> –       -2.      ,      .       , ,       .     .       -3    .   ,       ,        .       .      ,                . <br><br> –   .  - ? <br><br> –  , –  , –       -4       -,      .   ,             ,      .  ,     .  ,   ,    . <br><br> –    ,    . -   ? <br><br> –  , ! <br><br> – , . <br><br> –  ,        ,   ,      ,  ,  ,  . <br><br> –    .    . <br><br> –    - ,    … <br><br> –    .    .  ,      !    ?      ,    .      .            . <br><br><h2>   –    </h2><br>  , ,     .         ,    ,   ,  ,       . ,     ,        ,      ,    –     . <br><br>        ,   .         .    ,   :  - ,   ,   ,  .    ,    : <br><br> –   ,    ,      . <br><br>    ,     .        .    ,  . ,         ,       , , ,  .  ,  ,     ,         ,    .       . <br><br>       . --  --    : <br><br> –    ! –   . <br><br> – ,  , –    . –     ? <br><br> –     , –  , –       ,    ,         ,   , , . <br><br> –  ,     ? –  . <br><br> –   , –  . <br><br> –       ,         , –   . <br><br> –        ? –   . <br><br> –      - ,   ,    , –  --. –   ,     ,     .     :   -3   ? <br><br> –        , –  . <br><br> –    ? <br><br> –  ,     , –   . <br><br> –     ,    -,  ,    .  ,   ! <br><br>     ,     . <br><br>  *** <br><br>          .  ,       .             ,        ,  ,   ,   .       ,            .         ,       ,    . <br><br> --    ,     ,          -3 .      ,           ,          . <br><br>     ,      . ,     :    ,   .  ,   ,      ,    .     .           , ,         , ,    ,  ,  . <br><br>       : <br><br> –    ,        . <br><br> –    , ! <br><br> –    .     - , -   . <br><br> – , –  --, –     .    ,   ,       ,     .  - … <br><br> –  !      ,   ! <br><br> – , ,     ,    ?      ,  ,    , ,  ,        ,   . <br><br> –  ,  :   .   . <br><br>       .       . , ,     ,       ,      .      ,     .          .         .    –   ,        . <br><br>   :      --  --    .     ,  ,      ,  ,        .    ,     ,    -       .      ,       . <br><br>    ,   : <br><br> – ,   -4 ,    .     ,      ! <br><br> – ! –  --, –   ? <br><br> – ,   ,   .   ,      . <br><br>       !        .               . , , ,  .         … <br><br> , ,        ,    -4     (      ),           .  ,   ,              .  ,    ,   . <br><br>       -5     .     :      .      . <br><br>     ,  ,      ,    .   ,     ,         ,      . ,     ,      -5     .     , ,   . <br><br>        ,        ,       ,     .   ,     ,  ,     ,             .         :    ,  , ,   : <br><br> –    -3    ? –   . <br><br>      .           . <br><br>  ,      ,   : <br><br> – ,      , - ,    . <br><br> –     ,   ,   . <br><br> –  ,  :   ,      . <br><br>         ,   ,   . <br><br>     -   ,   ,    : <br><br> <i>– :        , ,  .       .    . <br><br> -.</i> <br><br>     .     ,   . ,     ,   , -2      -3.     ,    , ,  ,        ,      .  ,         ,      .      ,           . <br><br>    .     -.           --,    ,   .  --   : <br><br> –         .           , -,     .      .            .      …? <br><br> –  . <br><br> –         .       ,      . <br><br> –   ? –    . <br><br> –  ,   .   ,   , –  --. –    !     ,        .   ,   . <br><br> –   ,   !

I managed Mirolaz-2, and when we emerged on the other side, no one responded to our challenge. <br><br>  “Zenon, in such a situation, give a signal every hour,” ordered Ivanov before leaving. <br><br>  I gave several signals every hour, until after two days I did not hear the response signal from Socrates.  I gladly answered, gave a steady signal so that Socrates could take the right course for us. <br><br>  Mirolaz-3 got even more than us.  But Socrates, thanks to the experience that I conveyed, coped well with the transition and soon found himself there.  But this was only the beginning of the expedition.  We worked as part of the Mirolaz pulse engines and gradually approached the well-known, through the previous flight, slot-shell in the valve.  I stopped the rapprochement at a considerable distance so as not to fight the “wind” that was blowing out through this gap. <br><br>  Now it was time for Mirolaz-2 to go through it again, and Mirolaz-3 was too big for that.  All hope was on the loyalty of our friend - the supra-guy named Joe.  All the people lay in the gravity of my ship, except for the Sidorov piece of iron.  There was nothing more to wait, and I led my Mirolaz into a stream, which by the standards of the supra-world was just a micro leak.  But it is by their standards. <br><br>  A powerful stream caught us and, trusting the autopilot, we rushed through the microchip of the supra-world outward at great speed.  When I coped with all this, and switched to a normal speed limit, I immediately spotted Mirolaz-1 bearing, which Krishna aired. <br><br>  - Hello, Krishna, hello Agent!  - I shouted. <br><br>  - Hi brother!  Shouted Krishna in response. <br><br>  - Who is it with you?  - came the sleepy voice of the Agent. <br><br>  - Our flew! <br><br>  - On two Mirolazy!  - not without pride, I added. <br><br>  - What a news!  - the Agent was delighted, - and even such a trained guy, like me, began to go off from coils from loneliness.  Do not be near Krishna, probably would become a regular client of a psychiatrist! <br><br>  - All of ours are in the second Mirolaz, with me, but they are still sleeping, and Mirolaz-3 is waiting for us on the other side of the valve for one hundred seats. <br><br>  “Zenon, is he that empty?” <br><br>  - No, Krishna, you and I have a third brother, the youngest - Socrates.  Here he is working there as a pilot.  And for safety, I took all the people with me: it is still unknown how the flight through the half-open valve will work out, because this is the first time. <br><br>  “You only take me away from here,” the Agent pleaded, “Krishna himself can handle it, but I need to change the situation.” <br><br>  What is there to do, not to bring the Agent to madness?  I flew up and along the shortest trajectory passed through the “organism” to the first Mirolaz and successfully docked.  He opened the transitional compartment and a joyful Agent, rushed to hug me.  I barely got out, because you can’t use against your strength.  And then, the doctors recommend that emotions should be released on time, so I suffered, as it should, from pure philanthropy and for medical purposes. <br><br>  And during this time, Krishna moved to us.  Then I briefly introduced them to the course of affairs, more precisely to the Agent, and Krishna simply transferred the data, and he survived and learned all that I had experienced and learned.  After all, we, robots, can feel and live completely fully, those moments that are experienced by one of us, and this is our strength. <br><br>  “Only here I have one question: everything has been thought out perfectly, but I don’t understand one thing, how does Krishna know that it’s time to open the valve from the new Universe, does it mean to let us out?”  - asked the Agent. <br><br>  - See that safe?  This is a bird cage, and mechanical pigeons are sitting there, the postage goes without saying, each with a pulsed micromotor and with an embedded solid-state information store.  They are so small that they can fly over even quantum putty.  Their Ivanov and Ilyin developed before departure. <br><br>  - Then I am calm. <br><br>  “Me too,” Krishna replied. <br><br>  However, I was here in a difficult situation: all the bosses in the gravity capsules and there is no sense to defreeze them - you still have to freeze them, and then the Agent with his request.  The three of us conferred, and Krishna agreed that he would do it himself.  Krishna and I have separated our Mirolazes.  I carefully removed my ship from the “organism”, and Krishna began negotiations. <br><br>  Our supra-friend rejoiced when Krishna informed him of our return.  It turns out that his work shift is already coming to an end, and he hurried to open the valve, which led, from our TOKAMAK to their Universe.  We terribly worried about Socrates and the third Mirolaz, but everything worked out.  Soon Socrates contacted, took the bearing on us and stuck on the skin of our supra-friend.  It is fast, with enviable speed for us, and it was just a quick step, bringing us to a number of brand-new reactors. <br><br>  “He suggests choosing a reactor,” Krishna told us. <br><br>  “We do not care,” I decided, “if only I was in good order, and with a continuous cycle.” <br><br>  “Just a minute,” the Agent put in his word, “if the reactor was just launched, then there might not be planets suitable for us.”  It is necessary to choose a reactor where the reaction is already well established.  There and the temperature of the stars will be slightly lower and more suitable planets, so let's go somewhere in the middle of a number of new TOKAMAKs. <br><br>  Krishna conveyed the wishes of the Agent, and our friend Joe made a choice.  Having passed a few more reactors, he chose the right one for us, in his opinion.  This reactor was taller and thicker.  According to our classification, it belonged to the Globus type * and was three times larger than our old TOKAMAK.  Through Joe’s eye, we saw him take a thermometer out of the socket and suggested that we sit on its tip.  There was so much space that the fourth Mirolazy could be placed there in rows.  We sat down, and I secured Mirolaz with suckers and tacks.  And the agent immediately put him in a capsule, waited until the end of the freezing process, Krishna gave the go-ahead, and put us in an unknown world. <br><br>  Yes, they stuck it together with the thermometer, and then the valve was opened, and such a turbulence turned out that we without any engines flew into the new Universe so much that we almost ended up in its magnetic cocoon. <br><br>  “This is a pirouette,” Socrates exclaimed, shouting over magnetic vortices. <br><br>  - Long live autopilot and impulse engines!  Now that we are in this universe, we need to cross a great magnetic field. <br><br>  - Yes, brother, go away, turn on all the engines and accelerate as it should, the field here is somewhat more powerful. <br><br>  - If only I did not let the magnetic compensation! <br><br>  - See you on the other side. <br><br>  *** <br><br>  My Mirolaz shook for a week, it seemed.  Communication, of course, was absent, and the shaking was such that it was felt even in the protected felling.  I kept one manipulator on the handrail of the door, and the rest rested against the walls and ceiling of the cabin.  When Mirolaz was thrown out of the magnetic field, I was blinded by the glow of myriad stars.  Oddly enough, it was only 24 hours later, the ship was fine, and the identifier gave a signal at the correct frequency. <br><br>  - The abyss has opened: there are full stars, there are no stars, there is no bottom abyss!  - there was the voice of my brother, who quoted my favorite poems of an ancient poet **. <br><br>  - I'm glad to hear you too, brother!  My Mirolaz is intact, and the people in the capsules are fine. <br><br>  - I also have everything in order.  And we even jumped in line of sight, which in itself is a small miracle. <br><br>  Come now, we have to dock Mirolazy, and while you dock, I will start waking people up.  Now I’ll put on to reheat the food and the kettle ... <br><br>  When Socrates docked, Ivanov drank coffee, and Yu-Fu-Fyn soaked in a hot bath.  It was a mandatory procedure, and since there was one bathroom in our little Mirolaz, it was for this reason that there was a line for defrosting. <br><br>  A day passed, and the whole crew was assembled.  We moved to the third Mirolaz, there was a lot more space there, Socrates and I gave a feast, and Sergey Sergeevich, there was champagne in store, so that the holiday went out to glory.  Meanwhile, complex instruments were collecting data about the new universe.  The agent often came up to look at them, and sometimes he called Ivanov. <br><br>  In the camera external view was visible that same abyss.  It was an enchanting spectacle, quite different from what we saw in our Universe. <br><br>  - What a beauty!  - said Sidorov. <br><br>  “I myself am absolutely delighted with this species,” I answered him. <br><br>  “Zenon, no offense will be said, but I didn’t suspect that the robot could be familiar with the sense of beauty.” <br><br>  - It is, depending on which robot, and who is its creator!  However, I did not expect you, Sidorov either, only without offense. <br><br>  “And the most beautiful one is that giant spiral galaxy,” said the approached Agent. <br><br>  - Why?  I like her neighbor more, the colors are brighter there, ”Sidorov disagreed. <br><br>  “It may be brighter, but only the chief considers this particular galaxy to be the most promising for exploration.”  It’s very much like our motherland, where we all went from, looks like, only once in twenty more.  He says there may be thirty or forty billion stars and about as many planets. <br><br>  “Since Ivanov thinks so, then we need to get there soon.”  And on the spot will be easier to understand. <br><br>  - Tomorrow we will undock and fly, and in what area - the chief will say.  They are there with the Yu-Fu-Fyn now breaking spears, but they seem to converge in the middle of the right sleeve. <br><br>  *** <br><br>  The jump to the chosen galaxy on the hyperdrive took a day, in fact, accelerated and slowed down longer.  But now she covered the whole sky.  Now we were going on impulse engines, slowly approaching a given area.  The instruments collected a lot of information and displayed it on the supercomputer monitors.  We were so close that in a large telescope one could see the star systems of the very middle of the right arm, to which we were approaching. <br><br>  “In two days we will be above that solar system, it is most suitable for development,” said Ivanov. <br><br>  - And if there are already aborigines there?  - asked Yu-Fu-Fyn. <br><br>  “I think we need a free planet,” said Sergey Sergeevich. <br><br>  “Well, depending on what level those aborigines are,” said the Agent. <br><br>  “I think that Aboriginal people can be relocated, or they can settle on their own side,” said Kun. <br><br>  “I would rather agree with Sergey Sergeevich,” said Hun. <br><br>  “I’m justifying why,” said Sidorov.  “We will have problems above the roof, and we don’t need a problem with the natives.”  And this is not because I am afraid of problems ... <br><br>  “I, too, for a free planet,” agreed Ivanov, “and at the expense of the natives, I will say this: it is not yet known who will be in the role of savage, so you should not rush headlong to the very first suitable planet.”  Agent, how much time do we have?  After all, you talked with Joe for a long time while we were flying. <br><br>  - There is a lot of time before the arrival of our friend Joe, his shift is over, which means that we have three supra-days at our disposal.  By the way, all of our previous acquaintance was about half a day long.  To look for it in the huge supra-world is not an option, there are such distances, not to mention the other specifics of their world, that it is easier to wait in the engine room than to search.  And then, he will not be able to help us, being not at work, but entering work by pass, that is, it is an important object in the supra-world, and his safety is monitored. <br><br>  - So, - summed up Yu-Fu-Fyn, - all of our previous communication with Joe did not fit into one of his incomplete work shift, from which one can quite accurately calculate the interval of three shifts when it does not work.  So, before his arrival, we are by ourselves and we have a breakthrough of time, which must be used rationally. <br><br>  “It suits us, because we need to find many planets,” said Sergey Sergeevich.  - What is it worth settling one Mirolaz on a hundred and fifty billion people!  After all, even ten billion per planet and it turns out that we need to pick up fifteen good planets. <br><br>  “You are right, we have a lot of work, and it’s not worth wasting time in vain,” agreed Ivanov.  - I have already found about fifty suitable candidate planets for settlement, so we can start with them at any time. <br><br>  ––––––––––––––––––––– <br>  * Globus type is a reactor, also made in the form of a torus, that is, a donut, but a torus with a larger pipe diameter and a smaller inner diameter of the donut hole.  That is why it is closer in shape to the ball, which is why it received the name Globe. <br>  ** Poems M.V.  Lomonosov, an ancient poet and theorist of versification.
