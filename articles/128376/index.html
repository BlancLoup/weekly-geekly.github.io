  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Results of the recommendation contest or victory over the personnel crisis</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Recently a company asked us to help us quickly find a Ruby programmer.  They tried to look for themselves, but the attempts were not crowned with success - there are not so many competent specialists on the market.  We <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/itmozg/blog/126315/">announced a competition</a> with remuneration for the recommendation and for going to work, for two days we collected the recommendations of the necessary specialists and handed over to the company.  Two weeks went interviews.  Following the results of all negotiations, the company had to go bankrupt on two iPads and two iPhones - two people received an invitation to work.  It happens - they could not choose :) <br>  Under the cut there is a solemn rewarding of employees and recommenders receiving devices from the hands of the company owner.  The employees are real, in boxes, iPhones and iPads, but there are four of them, no, they haven‚Äôt taken them away. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Employer</b> comment: <br><br>  ‚ÄúAs employers, we heard that the search for good Ruby programmers could drag on for months and, therefore, quickly decided on a new way for us - to hold a contest of recommendations.  After a week and a half, we closed two vacancies - the best result was difficult to expect.  Thanks to the guys from ITMozg for their creative offer and immaculate holding of the whole competition! ‚Äù <br><br>  New employee times: <b>Sergey Efremov</b>

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/ca41ffa1/a7b57088/c3c1c767/436729b7.jpg"><br><br>  ‚ÄúI safely missed the announcement of this contest, recommended by a friend who is a regular reader of Habr.  Then (when I was already aware of the competition) - I was invited for an interview, where I was very interested in the project.  The interview passed, and for two weeks I have been working enthusiastically at a new place.  And the iPad has become a very nice bonus, it has already been wholly handed over to the children. ‚Äù <br><br>  New employee two: <b>Ilya Zayats</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/5b2ebff0/088084a5/688296bb/8134c972.jpg"><br><br>  ‚ÄúA friend wrote to me once on Skype, where he gave a link to the contest and asked if he could recommend me.  A couple of days later I received a call requesting an interview, and by the end of the week I had already written an application for dismissal from the previous place.  And now I have been working for more than two weeks to make it easier for any of you to visualize your professional activities and your achievements. ‚Äù <br><br>  The <b>referee</b> is <b>Alexey Vedyakov</b> (recommendation by Ilya Zajc): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/3e8ce7a5/37c7ecd0/ce7b7116/e4de1cc4.jpg"><br><br>  ‚ÄúI saw information about the contest in Habr√©. <br>  The prizes were interested, and, despite the fact that everything is simple, I decided to recommend my friend. <br>  Fortunately, a friend was ideally suited, and even a week before that he was talking about the sorrows at his former job. <br>  Further silence, I already forgot about the contest, in the middle of September I was contacted and told that I could come to the award.  So simple. <br>  This is definitely a worthwhile idea about accelerated employee search. ‚Äù <br><br>  Counselor Two - <b>Andrei Gorodetsky</b> (recommendation of Sergey Efremov. I arrived a little later, the situation is less official): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/a13030cf/e5e45090/d1b3fac0/5020580c.jpg"><br><br>  ‚ÄúI love a freebie.  I saw an ad in the vk.com/itmozg group and decided to recommend my friend, in general he is my only friend rubist, well at least the one about whom I know he is rubist.  Of course, my chances were slim ‚Äî but my friend turned out to be a really good rubist ‚Äî and really wanted to change jobs. <br>  I already had one iphone, but it just broke, so everything had to be very much into the topic. ‚Äù <br><br>  <b>Total:</b> <br><br>  - only two weeks were spent on closing two difficult positions (only interviews) <br>  - total financial costs for the search for both did not exceed one month‚Äôs salary per specialist <br>  - according to the first results of work, reviews about people are only positive <br>  - the guys are happy, they say that they like the work and their ipads work <br>  - ??? <br>  Profit! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/128376/">https://habr.com/ru/post/128376/</a></p>
