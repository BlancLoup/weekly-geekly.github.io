More specifically, it transmits via <a href="http://www.bluetooth.com/Pages/low-energy-tech-info.aspx">Bluetooth Low Energy a</a> signal with its unique identifier.  The beacon signal is detected by the smartphone with the ability to determine the distance to it.  The detection range depending on the model of the lighthouse reaches 50-70 meters.  The lighthouse works autonomously from a battery, which will last from six months to two, or even up to three years. <br><br>  Possible applications are limited only by fantasy: <br><ul><li>  in-door navigation in shopping centers, at exhibitions and conferences; </li><li>  in-place information and special offers for visitors of retail chains; </li><li>  smartphone - a guide in museums; </li><li>  Smartphone - the key to the apartment, car, hotel room or a pass to the office. </li></ul><br>  Inspired by these prospects, I decided in parallel with the marketing analysis to ‚Äúfeel‚Äù the technology with my own hands, and I ordered several test copies. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d57/f8d/cde/d57f8dcde85f80f42029df4f15acf68a.jpg"><a name="habracut"></a>

      Conditionally divided suppliers into three categories: <br><ul><li>  Chinese suppliers; </li><li>  suppliers from ‚Äúdeveloped western‚Äù countries; </li><li>  Western developers ready-made solutions for specific tasks. </li></ul><br>  Below I will tell about the first two categories.  The third deserves a separate post.  By the way, at the end of the article there is a comparative table, which includes the process of cargo delivery.  Therefore, if you are too lazy to read the details - move immediately to her. <br><br><h4>  Chinese suppliers </h4><br>  I was looking for Chinese suppliers through <a href="http://alibaba.com/">Alibaba.com</a> , a trading platform for manufacturers.  Request "iBeacon" issued about 400 positions from 30 manufacturers.  A distinctive feature of this category is that they simply sell a piece of hardware with documentation and a minimal set of tools to configure it.  In fact, this is a first-hand product. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7db/354/5ff/7db3545ffbf5cebcaea4c9be4229436f.png"><br><br>  Not all the issue turned out to be relevant, in the end I requested samples from approximately a dozen companies for the test.  To at least somehow reduce the risks associated only with suppliers with the status of "Gold Supplier".  Then I chose based on the speed and quality of feedback. <br><br>  I chose three suppliers, ordering 3-4 test samples from each: <br><ul><li>  <a href="http://ankhmaway.en.alibaba.com/">Shenzhen Ankhmaway Electronic Technology Co., Ltd.</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://minew.en.alibaba.com/">Shenzhen Minew Technologies Co., Ltd.</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://aprbrother.en.alibaba.com/">Beijing Aprilbrother Technology Co., Ltd.</a> </li></ul><br><br>  In the process of abandoned: <br><ul><li>  Shenzhen Taida Century Technology Co., Ltd.  - seemed like a counterpart from Shenzhen Shuzhitong Technology Co., Ltd; </li><li>  Hongrun Electronics (Shenzhen) Co., Ltd.  - very sluggish feedback did not cause confidence: </li><li>  Aladintel Network Technology Pte.  Ltd - likewise, flimsy repulsed the desire to make an order. </li></ul><br><br><h5>  Shenzhen Ankhmaway Electronic Technology Co., Ltd. </h5><br>  The guys respond promptly, willingly and clearly answer questions.  The range consists of four models, different battery, the presence or absence of a plastic case and an antenna, which determines the range of the signal.  Together with the lighthouses provides tools and APIs for configuration.  I chose my choice on two models: <br><ul><li>  <b>iB001</b> : CR2032 battery, 40m range, with plastic case.  $ 20 <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a77/fb2/5d6/a77fb25d69829056079c5b0c96d230d9.jpg"></li><li>  <b>iB004</b> : CR2450 battery, 70m range, with plastic case.  $ 25 <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/41f/b86/fdc/41fb86fdc42a756ba81c34239a3d9cae.jpg"></li></ul><br><br>  Delivery via EMS Russian Post took 10 calendar days. <br><br><h5>  Shenzhen Minew Technologies Co., Ltd. </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/609/0ec/10b/6090ec10b29c86f31dcfc7aefe9cad96.jpg"><br>  The result of a pleasant communication with the manager was the order of samples.  It is difficult to isolate any features - standard iBeacon functionality and an application for configuring beacons are declared.  Models differ in color, you can also order a batch of your own color for large volumes.  The price for one lighthouse is $ 18.  Delivery via EMS Russian Post took 7 calendar days. <br><br><h5>  Beijing Aprilbrother Technology Co., Ltd </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4e4/eed/6f6/4e4eed6f61b40fd55a72a5acb5fe88f3.jpg"><br>  Provides standard features compared to previous models.  The piece of hardware itself cost me $ 18.8.  It is worth noting that I did not bargain about the price, because  The main goal was to get and test devices from different suppliers, try to work with them.  When ordering large quantities discount.  Delivery via EMS Russian Post took 7 calendar days. <br><br><h4>  Suppliers from ‚Äúdeveloped western‚Äù countries </h4><br>  Western manufacturers of lighthouses, I basically walked one by one.  The article on <a href="http://beekn.net/guide-to-ibeacons/">beekn.com</a> turned out to be quite useful.  A feature in this category is a more pleasant, and sometimes the original design of the device, and the overall product flow.  Also, companies from this category are trying to provide at least the minimum set of tools for easy configuration of beacons. <br><br>  Of the ten options, I chose to sample the three suppliers who made the most pleasant impression with their openness and promptness in communication: <br><ul><li>  <a href="http://kontakt.io/">Kontakt.io</a> , Poland; </li><li>  <a href="http://bluecats.com/">BlueCats</a> , Australia; </li><li>  <a href="http://www.accent-systems.com/">Accent Advanced Systems</a> , Spain. </li></ul><br><br>  Refused or postponed: <br><ul><li>  GeLo, USA, MI - an updated version of devices is expected to be released in May; </li><li>  Gimbal by Qualcomm - do not work with Russia and position themselves as platform developers, not as an iron supplier; </li><li>  Sonic Notify - not ready to provide test samples;  The solution is wider than the platform based on iBeacon; </li><li>  Estimote - after the pre-order will have to wait 6 weeks;  seemed to me stingy on personal communication; </li><li>  Sensorberg - did not respond to a request for test samples; </li><li>  BlueSense Networks - did not get in touch after requesting test samples; </li><li>  Radius Networks - did not get in touch after requesting test samples. </li></ul><br><br><h5>  Kontakt.io </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f81/944/822/f8194482277d2d8fec89f6f134c308fd.jpg"><br>  Friendly-minded guys were happy to share information about their product.  From features: provide developers with access to the CMS to manage beacons, download content and set up rules for displaying it in a mobile application.  The cost of one device when ordering a test batch is $ 27. <br><br>  About the delivery should be told separately.  The supplier chose UPS, which turned out to be a fatal mistake.  From the moment of sending to receiving it took 15 days, and one day on my trip to Vnukovo airport and customs clearance.  Throwing away the emotions experienced in the process, I will tell you about the dry residue. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/99e/952/67d/99e95267d5954add47713c9daa7d21c9.png"><br><br>  So.  In the case of shipment through UPS, the goods go through the procedure of customs clearance (in the case of EMS, it is either not there or it is transparent to the recipient in the case of small loads).  Customs clearance is possible only products for which there is a "notification".  What is ‚Äúnotification‚Äù, how to find or get its UPS employees could not explain to me.  Two weeks later, it was reported that the goods most likely would not be released by customs, and I could come to deal with them myself.  When I arrived, I had to spend about two hours filling out various forms and preparing documents.  UPS staff just made me a printout of templates and invoices.  The customs officer told me about the ‚Äúnotifications‚Äù.  I managed to find a ‚Äúnotification‚Äù on the spot, after which the ‚Äúcustoms gave the go-ahead‚Äù, and the next day I received the parcel.  By the way, here it is, a screenshot at the cost of two weeks of cargo delay and one day of fights on the spot.  Thank you for helping the guys from the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/RuBeacon/">Facebook theme group</a> . <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b0b/43c/e2a/b0b43ce2a59cd60089bab22de35cc8b2.png"><br><br><h5>  Accent Advanced Systems </h5><br>  Pure iron suppliers, but from Spain.  One of the two models has a remote button on the body of the lighthouse.  The status of its pressing is transmitted along with the signal identifier.  This allows you to build an interesting logic.  For example, to confirm the actual location of the user in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe lighthouse and protect against emulation and fraud.  A fly in the ointment - the button click status is supported by Android, and iOS is not supported. <br>  The cost of one copy when ordering a test batch is ‚Ç¨ 20. <br><br>  With the delivery in this case, everything is also sad.  The first package I received via TNT reached me 13 days after ordering.  Having opened it, I did not know whether to cry or laugh - only the bodies from the devices arrived: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8c9/ab9/cc9/8c9ab9cc9650e79e23dc9ef994acf240.jpg"><br><br>  We must pay tribute to Accent Advanced Systems.  Immediately after my message about the pad, the manager sent me 4 devices at the company's expense.  But sent through UPS.  What happened next?  Customs clearance, which did not pass due to the lack of "notification" of this model.  The package went back to sunny Spain, and now we are discussing how to send it again. <br><br><h5>  Bluecats </h5><br>  Devices with the original design in the form of a cat's head.  Features: <br><ul><li>  AA batteries, which should simplify their replacement; </li><li>  admin panel for easy management of individual lighthouses or a pack at once. </li></ul><br>  I did not learn anything about more advanced business solutions from the guys from this team.  I assume that they are in the segment of iron suppliers, rather than ready-to-use solutions for specific business segments.  Starter-pack cost me 100 AUD for three beacons, excluding delivery. <br><br>  I do not attach photos, because I still have not received the device.  From the time of payment at the time of publication of the article three weeks have passed.  The guys in the letters convince me that they have sent an order long ago, but they do not provide any specifics (tracking number, for example). <br><br><h4>  Let's sum up </h4><br><table><tbody><tr><th>  Provider </th><th>  A country </th><th>  Special features </th><th>  Cost of </th><th>  Delivery </th></tr><tr><td>  <a href="http://ankhmaway.en.alibaba.com/">Shenzhen ankhmaway</a> </td><td>  China </td><td>  standard beacon </td><td>  iB001: $ 20 <br>  iB004: $ 25 <br></td><td>  EMS, 10 days, $ 30 </td></tr><tr><td>  <a href="http://minew.en.alibaba.com/">Shenzhen minew</a> </td><td>  China </td><td>  standard beacon <br></td><td>  $ 18 </td><td>  EMS, 7 days, $ 35 </td></tr><tr><td>  <a href="http://aprbrother.en.alibaba.com/">Beijing Aprilbrother</a> </td><td>  China </td><td>  standard beacon <br></td><td>  $ 18.8 </td><td>  EMS, 7 days, $ 15 </td></tr><tr><td>  <a href="http://kontakt.io/">Kontakt.io</a> </td><td>  Poland </td><td>  "Neat" device design <br>  CMS to manage beacons <br>  demo application <br></td><td>  $ 27 </td><td>  UPS, 15 days, $ 20 <br>  + hassle with UPS <br>  + customs </td></tr><tr><td>  <a href="http://www.accent-systems.com/">Accent Advanced Systems</a> </td><td>  Spain </td><td>  push button <br>  transmits its state <br>  only supported on Android <br></td><td>  ‚Ç¨ 20 </td><td>  inattention <br>  when first shipped <br>  second send via <br>  UPS locked <br>  customs and shipped <br>  back <br></td></tr><tr><td>  <a href="http://bluecats.com/">Bluecats</a> </td><td>  Australia </td><td>  AA batteries <br></td><td>  $ 33 </td><td>  did not arrive in 21 days <br></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/220875/">https://habr.com/ru/post/220875/</a></p>
