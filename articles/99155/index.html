  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to make yourself push up in the morning</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  My sporting life is banal.  For several years I was seriously engaged in the section, then I quit, then again I studied and again I quit.  Somewhere about a year ago, began to swim fat.  For me it even became a problem to run a hundred meters to the bus stop. <br><br>  Pathetic attempts to somehow return to physical education broke about the harsh reality.  Riding to workouts at rush hour is so hard.  Being in the gym is so boring.  There is an awful lot of work, and I'm already very tired today ... isn't it better to spend the evening with beer and friends?  These excuses are known to all, and I certainly have not invented a single new one.  I managed to break myself completely unexpectedly three weeks ago.  Yes, the term is still short, but these 3 weeks I go in for sports in a very hard mode, I like it, and my determination is only increasing.  How did I manage to program myself? <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  The first step is to want to play sports. </h4>

      I, of course, notice the passage of time.  Gradually I grow old, like everything else, my body becomes flabby, my heart weakens, and so on.  All these bad things are done quite imperceptibly, and therefore they are perceived as a gradual process and at each particular moment in time is not particularly scary. <br><br>  At some point, I thought that I was losing something irretrievably.  Losing strength, health.  Losing, finally, the beauty of the body, some kind of physical attractiveness.  That a few more years at this rate - and I will simply become unattractive for girls!  When I thought about it, I fixed this thought in my mind and spun it to the scale of a personal tragedy for several days.  I was really scared that I would lose myself young, the one who ran 12 kilometers without much stress, who was not ashamed to look in the mirror, and moreover - I would lose completely without a fight, I would lose with a bottle of beer, sitting at the computer and throwing out sweaty hairy belly on the elastic of cowards. <br><br>  For several days I was depressed.  Then I realized that I need to do something, and immediately. <br><br><h4>  The second step - too lazy to the side! </h4><br><br>  The most frequent excuse for postponing the sport for later is ‚Äúno time‚Äù.  It was the easiest to handle.  I decided to play sports daily.  Absolutely daily.  When I went to a drunk from 9 in the morning until 12 at night, I got up at 6 in the morning (and did not sleep well) and went for a run.  When I came home at one in the morning - I went in for sports until two.  Several times during these three weeks I ran in the pouring rain.  There is no excuse for skipping at least one day.  It is very tunes in combat mode. <br><br>  By the way, a good life hack is to tell someone, you often communicate with someone: ‚ÄúBut we argue that for the next 5 years I will not miss a single workout in one day?‚Äù.  I did so, and for a fairly substantial amount.  It would be sad not only to give money - but to show that I could not. <br><br><h4>  Doing sports for real </h4><br><br>  Two things are important.  First, the sport should be interesting to you.  I used to do martial arts.  Therefore, every day I do jogging through the forest with complications, push-ups, stretching, practicing punches, sparring (if I don‚Äôt run myself).  In the forest I do what interests me.  It is interesting - to tumble on the run, crawl dozens of meters at high speed, climb trees.  This is all great muscle load, and I'm not bored to do it. <br><br>  Secondly, you need to deal with exhaustion.  It is necessary to forget about the recommendations "avoid overtraining" and "protect the heart."  My problem is in my laziness and only in it, and the inner voice strives to say ‚Äúwell, that's enough for today, I‚Äôll go home‚Äù.  Not!  Home - please, but only after you feel that if you continue to practice further, you will feel bad. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/99155/">https://habr.com/ru/post/99155/</a></p>
