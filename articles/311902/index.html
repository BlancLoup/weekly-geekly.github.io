      We have selected 9 practical examples of the use of automation in the marketing of an online store, which you will implement without any problems. <br><br><br><h1>  1. Welcome emails </h1><br><h3>  Trigger: user left <strong>email</strong> (subscribed, registered, left a request, placed an order) </h3><br>  Collect email from your users and then automatically send them a letter with thanks and your creativity (the main thing is that the letter conveys emotions and is remembered). <br><br>  Expanding the lead database of your online store is vital, so do not forget to warm each such lead with a letter.  Invest in this process and you will see the result in the nearest cohorts.  <a href="http://www.carrotquest.io/blog/polzovatel-ne-ostavil-email-9-primerov-kak-ego-uderzhat-i-dovesti-do-pokupki/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dcontent%26utm_content%3D9primerov%26utm_campaign%3Dautomation"><b>By the way, it is possible to work effectively with the user, even if he never left an email</b></a> . <br><br>  Any visitor who left email is very important for your business.  Make him love you with cool, thoughtful writing.  What if in a letter to offer him a discount on future purchases (more standard) or throw off a link to a new autumn collection with its description, I wonder, really? <br><br>  Less advertising, more benefits, then the average bill and LTV will be much higher, and the conversion into the purchase will increase. <br><br><h1>  2. Automation by purchase cycle </h1><br><h3>  Trigger: timeout by action (for example, 30 days after purchase) </h3><br>  Buyers in the online store have left email, but have not purchased anything yet.  It is clear that they have an interest, but something is holding them back.  You can use the fact of leaving an email and a time period for which the user has not made a purchase as a trigger.  If he never bought, then something stopped him - just in time push him to the purchase, until he went to the competitors - give a promotional code for a discount or offer the help of a specialist. <br><br>  Users always doubt the last step of the purchase, this is the psychology that we have <a href="http://www.carrotquest.io/blog/38-prodazh-za-schet-onlajn-konsultanta-dlya-sajta-kak-dobitsya-takogo-pokazatelya/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dcontent%26utm_content%3D9primerov%26utm_campaign%3Dautomation"><b>analyzed</b></a> in detail <a href="http://www.carrotquest.io/blog/38-prodazh-za-schet-onlajn-konsultanta-dlya-sajta-kak-dobitsya-takogo-pokazatelya/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dcontent%26utm_content%3D9primerov%26utm_campaign%3Dautomation"><b>- the user has a heightened sense of risk</b></a> . <br><br>  The buyer made the order 3 months ago, but since then it hasn‚Äôt bought anything.  You can customize the trigger message with the text something like "We miss you" or "There are a lot of new things, see what decorates your wardrobe."  And attach to it products similar in subject to those that were purchased just 3 months ago. <br><br>  The same method is suitable for seasonal goods: someone bought something during the New Year holidays.  We can assume that a year later, he also wants to buy something. <br><br><h1>  3. Letter of an abandoned basket </h1><br><h3>  Trigger: abandoned basket </h3><br>  About 80% of users drop baskets, this is normal, our task is to return them so that they complete the purchase.  We send the client something like an incentive that makes him come back. <br><br>  The first letter about the abandoned basket should be sent immediately after the ‚Äúthrowing‚Äù of the basket, while the client still remembers what the site was and what he wanted to find or buy there.  Marketing automation is perfect for this because  By automating the process, you save yourself a bunch of strengths and resources.  You can even send more than one letter, but a whole chain calculated by time and designed to finish off the client and return him to your basket.  In the second letter you can, for example, give him a code for a discount, but which expires very quickly. <br><br>  Tip: always add products from the basket to the letter.  It is also worth mentioning that you can throw away old products, and add new ones, and always offer your assistance for ordering, shipping, etc. <br><br><br><h1>  4. Automation based on collected data </h1><br><h3>  Triggers: clicks, search, visited pages. </h3><br><blockquote>  <em>Dmitry Sergeev, CEO of the Carrot Quest service: ‚ÄúWhen you collect key information about each user in the <a href="http://www.carrotquest.io/automation-marketing%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dcontent%26utm_content%3D9primerov%26utm_campaign%3Dautomation"><b>Carrot Quest</b></a> service: you know who he is, what he did on the site, where he went, what he clicked, where he came from, how many times he was and much more.</em>  <em>This knowledge allows you to fully automate all communications under the behavior and features of the user. "</em> </blockquote><br>  For example: a user opened a newsletter letter and became interested in a specific product or category.  You can speed up the selling process with targeted content (suggestions based on user behavior). <br><br>  The trigger can be any, depending on the purpose and action, but you need to choose such that the excuse seemed to the client timely and appropriate.  And here it depends on your imagination: the client visited the catalog, clicked somewhere several times and a lot of various options. <br><br>  The collection of information about the buyer should be carried out even when we are not yet sure that he is our potential client (even before he leaves his contacts).  This information will help later - then you will know exactly what product he was interested in earlier and his other features. <br><br><h1>  5. Automation based on collected data, recommendations and cross selling </h1><br><h3>  Trigger: shopping </h3><br>  Automatic messages, which use the history of a user's previous purchases as filters, also include recommendations, tips, etc. You can also give recommendations on certain products that were purchased by the buyer, for example, give detailed reviews on the use and purchase of others. goods. <br><br>  The client bought his shoes.  Offer him a letter to buy shoe care products or warm insoles for the winter.  Tell us how this will help.  Shoes have an average interval between purchases of about 6-12 months.  Why not recommend the customer another pair of shoes when it comes time for new ones? <br><br>  A customer purchases a product that requires support or regular consultation.  Send them such letters automatically, anticipating their possible questions and giving yourself the opportunity to advertise products from another catalog. <br><br>  Hint: if a customer has purchased this product now, it is quite possible after a certain time he will need it again.  It does not work with all types of goods, but you can use a lot of places. <br><br><h1>  6. Letters with thanks </h1><br><h3>  Trigger: buy </h3><br>  Say thank you for the purchase, a great topic for writing, is not it?  And what if you send this letter a few weeks after the purchase?  Marketing automation works even better if you combine it with reviews of your products.  Show reviews on products that could complement the first purchase.  Believe me, the client will be pleased.  In general, the purpose of such letters is appropriate to remind of yourself, to give a favor and return the client. <br><br><h1>  7. Personalized automation </h1><br><h3>  Trigger: user properties </h3><br>  Next to the customer in his immediate vicinity may be your store.  Tell everyone in the city that your store is near.  You can visit it. <br><br>  Collect information about the birthdays of customers or their relatives so that you can make personalized and targeted newsletters.  You can again offer them a gift or a discount card, for example. <br><br><h1>  8. Automation based on loyalty points </h1><br><h3>  Trigger: previous purchases </h3><br>  Love and appreciate your most loyal and loyal customers: give them rewards for a certain number of purchases. <br><br>  Wake your passive users from hibernation: for example, those who have once bought something, but that was a long time ago, after which they did not return.  It is important to correctly test which particular campaigns work effectively and how exactly they work. <br><br>  The reason may be a letter with a reminder that the customer has bonus points in the store. <br><br><h1>  9. Reminders </h1><br><h3>  Trigger: checkout </h3><br>  Marketing automation is a great way to work out orders (abandoned and unfinished) at any stage of the order.  Only need to select the triggers.  For example: <br><br>  You can send them a missed payment message.  Or that we have not received payment <br><br>  You can notify the customer that the goods are waiting for his payment.  Always keep the customer in the course of ongoing processes. <br><br>  Automatic reminders can be tied at all to any user action on the site that is meaningful to you. <br><br><h1>  Results and tests </h1><br>  You can start automating your marketing with literally a couple of letters or chains.  And then test, compare, analyze.  All that is required is a flexible tool and strategy.  Monitoring results is very important - after all, each online store has its own characteristics in marketing and customers. <br><br>  With pleasure, the <a href="http://www.carrotquest.io/automation-marketing%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dcontent%26utm_content%3D9primerov%26utm_campaign%3Dautomation"><b>Carrot Quest</b></a> service team is a service that collects key information about each visitor to your site and on the basis of it helps to guide him to purchase, both manually and automatically. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/311902/">https://habr.com/ru/post/311902/</a></p>
