This device belongs to the <b>Store Once</b> line, with which we want to introduce you today. <br><br>  The Store Once line is not HP's first backup experience.  The best technologies and functional systems of <b>HP D2D BackupSystem</b> became the basis for the new storage systems, which became the third major generation of disk libraries from Hewlett-Packard.

      In July 2013  virtual version of the library - <b>StoreOnce VSA</b> .  This is software that runs under the VMware hypervisor and turns a regular x86 server into a StoreOnce disk library.  The solution is intended for SMB and branches of large organizations when there is no budget for a dedicated library.  The license allows you to use up to 10 TB of pure disk capacity of the server and add up to 200TB of deduplicated information onto it.  This option will be much cheaper than the iron solution, in addition, the license includes HP technical support, replication capability, and <b>HP StoreOnce Catalyst</b> (more about it later).  Of course, VSA has a number of limitations, which does not allow using the solution in large installations: the backup speed reaches a maximum of 300 Gb / h (with HP Catalyst - 500 Gb / h), the system works only with iSCSI, and with the file backup only CIFS is supported.  The license itself is only valid for 3 years, then it must be re-purchased (or, if your business has grown, switch to a hardware solution). <br><br>  As for iron devices, everything starts with a simple <b>HP StoreOnce 2600 system</b> : a modest 4 terabytes of storage space (usable capacity - 2.5 TB), bandwidth up to 670 GB / hour, one place in the server rack.  Small business and a small office will last long.  Considering deduplication and all adult functions (and the system supports absolutely everything the same as the monstrous case B6200) up to 50 TB of deduplicated information can be stored on it! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/135/b90/9a9/135b909a9fc3b71eeb9c7f1d123ae9a9.png"><br><br>  The solution is slightly larger - the <b>HP StoreOnce 4210</b> , the basic kit of which already occupies 2 slots in the server rack, supports expansion with an additional shelf of disks, and can contain up to 9 TB of usable capacity, and modification <b>4220</b> - up to 18 TB. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f7f/994/134/f7f994134d1772238e2aa01d7073a33b.png"><br><table><tbody><tr><td>  HP StoreOnce System: <br></td><td>  VSA <br></td><td>  2620 <br></td><td>  4210 <br></td><td>  4220 <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Usable capacity <br></td><td>  10 TB <br></td><td>  2.5 TB <br></td><td>  4-9 TB <br></td><td>  8-18 TB <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Deduplication Capacity <br></td><td>  200 TB <br></td><td>  50 TB <br></td><td>  80-180 TB <br></td><td>  160-360 TB <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Upgrades <br></td><td>  - </td><td>  not <br></td><td>  1 shelf <br></td><td>  1 shelf <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Write Performance (VTL) <br></td><td>  Up to 300 GB / hour <br></td><td>  Up to 670 GB / hour <br></td><td>  Up to 2.9 TB / hour <br></td><td>  Up to 3.3 TB / hour <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Performance with StoreOnce Catalyst <br></td><td>  Up to 500 GB / hour <br></td><td>  Up to 1 TB / hour <br></td><td>  Up to 2.2 TB / hour <br></td><td>  Up to 2.2 TB / hour <br></td></tr><tr><td>  iSCSI ports <br></td><td>  there is <br></td><td>  Two 1Gb <br></td><td>  Two 1Gb <br></td><td>  Two 10Gb <br></td></tr><tr><td>  FC ports <br></td><td>  not <br></td><td>  not <br></td><td>  Two 8Gb <br></td><td>  Two 8Gb <br></td></tr><tr><td>  RAID (hardware) <br></td><td>  - </td><td>  five <br></td><td>  6 <br></td><td>  6 <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Starter Kit Size <br></td><td>  - </td><td>  1U <br></td><td>  2U <br></td><td>  2U <br></td></tr><tr><td>  The number of virtual drives <br></td><td>  sixteen <br></td><td>  32 <br></td><td>  64 <br></td><td>  96 <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Number of virtual libraries <br></td><td>  four <br></td><td>  eight <br></td><td>  sixteen <br></td><td>  24 <br></td></tr></tbody></table><br>  The older <b>HP StoreOnce 44x0 line</b> is serious systems that support up to three upgrade shelves with disks, occupy 4U in the basic configuration and have up to 76 TB of out-of-box usable capacity.

Terabytes per hour of data and 512 TB of usable capacity.  With deduplication, this is all 10 pb.  Who there wanted to make a backup of the Internet, in case, the introduction of the Great Russian Firewall?  :) <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6f9/0f0/d8f/6f90f0d8f75048ec8ce8c72d1665ed7a.png"><br><table><tbody><tr><td>  HP StoreOnce System: <br></td><td>  B6200 <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Usable capacity <br></td><td>  32-512 TB <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Deduplication Capacity <br></td><td>  640TB - 10PB <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Upgrades <br></td><td>  30 shelves + 6 controllers <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Write Performance (VTL) <br></td><td>  Up to 40 TB / hour <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Performance with StoreOnce Catalyst <br></td><td>  Up to 100 TB / hour <br></td></tr><tr><td>  iSCSI ports <br></td><td>  4-16 10Gb <br></td></tr><tr><td>  FC ports <br></td><td>  4-16 8Gb <br></td></tr><tr><td>  RAID (hardware) <br></td><td>  6 <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Starter Kit Size <br></td><td>  10U <br></td></tr><tr><td>  The number of virtual drives <br></td><td>  1536 <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Number of virtual libraries <br></td><td>  384 <br></td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><h1>  Accelerate backup with HP Catalyst </h1><br>  To expand the functionality of disk libraries, we created the HP Catalyst.  This is a software agent that is installed on a media server (backup server) running HP DataProtector or Symantec NetBackup and Backup Exec backup software.  HP Catalyst performs data deduplication right on the media servers, using the functionality of this software and sends the already deduplicated data to the HP StoreOnce system.  This makes it possible to achieve high backup speeds, since the pool of media servers is capable of handling a much larger stream than a single dedicated target device.  For example, the HP B6200 top-end system can record data with deduplication at speeds up to 40 TB / hour, and using HP Catalyst, already up to 100 TB / hour. <br><br>  The main difference between HP Catalyst and most analogs is the work not only over LAN, but also over WAN.  Thus, in small regional offices, you can not install a dedicated HP StoreOnce library, but only install HP Catalyst + backup software on the media server.  And the backup in deduplicated form will go to the HP StoreOnce library in the central office or a large territorial office.  Then this backup can be transferred, for example, to a backup data center, and then return the data to the regional office, bypassing the data center.  And all this without rehydration (recovery), that is, the data will always be in deduplicated form, which saves on channels, disk capacities and does not waste time and computing resources on multiple deduplication and rehydration of data.  All this is possible due to the fact that all software and hardware devices use a single HP StoreOnce software developed by HP Labs.  This allows multi-branch organizations to organize centralized backup management and its consolidation with minimal costs. <br><br><h1>  Service </h1><br>  We have repeatedly come across comments in which the authors try to compare our servers with their counterparts from other vendors (or self-assembled / ordered servers / skh / workstations / thin clients).  The problem with this comparison is that one very important factor is not taken into account: Enterprise solutions may not have an ideal price / performance or price / volume ratio, but always have a customer support system.  Thin clients replace the warranty (and if long-term support is included in the general order, the courier himself will arrive as soon as possible and bring the appropriate piece of hardware, and take the old one to us, and we will find a common language with it).  Servers and storage systems have many small convenient utilities, round-the-clock support online and by phone, diagnostics and monitoring tools, fast integration systems.  All iron in general has a common ecosystem with which it interacts perfectly, the ‚Äúonce mood, use it a hundred times‚Äù policy works.  All these services somehow affect the price of a turnkey solution, and if the price of the initial implementation is higher than that of a similar ‚Äúself-assembly‚Äù or a hodgepodge of equipment from different vendors, according to the principle ‚ÄúI will save here, I‚Äôll do it myself, leave it as it is‚Äù , the cost of service, the quality of technical support and the reliability of such a solution raise questions. <br><br>  The StoreOnce system supports many HP services: <b>SupportPlus 24</b> , <b>Installation &amp; Startup</b> , <b>Proactive Care L2</b> , <b>Proactive Select</b> , <b>HP Backup &amp; Recovery Service for Data Protector</b> .  All of them are aimed at the most efficient work and receiving instant technical support anywhere in the world, at any time, and allow not only to eliminate, but also to foresee / prevent many problems arising in complex systems. <br><br>  In our opinion, it is better to spend a little more initially, but to have no problems later than to face any problem without the support of the vendor, get idle time at work or Data Loss, hit the face in front of an important partner, boss or SB, because the whole The corporate sector is now based precisely on IT and modern technologies for the transfer, processing and storage of data. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/186430/">https://habr.com/ru/post/186430/</a></p>
