Among other things that we analyze - sales of various goods.  Sales are closely monitored, and we use the results of the analysis of the current situation to create a work / sales plan for the coming period (year, month, week). <br><br>  One of these days, we decided once again to see which products we sell best, and made up a kind of top-10.  In general, we decided to share this information with Geektimes readers.  Perhaps someone is also engaged in sales, and this information will be interesting.  Well, and geeks can understand that now in Russia in the trend.  Next time, by the way, we will evaluate the best-selling goods from Amazon, more precisely, the goods from the Amazon Launchpad site. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So, the top 10 best-selling products Madrobots, we meet!  At first, the plate is a summary of sales for the month, in pieces, from the end of November to the current date.

It is a combined system, which includes a large number of "sensorimotor means of relaxation and concentration."  There is even a recess, which is made in the image and likeness of jade stones "calm" from ancient China.  The Chinese, and not only them, have been using ‚Äústones of anxiety‚Äù for relaxation for thousands of years.  In addition, there are buttons, a joystick, a switch, a ball and wheels, a disk with a handle.  All this clicks, spins, pushes, which allows you to stop nervous.  This tool is true, proven by thousands of buyers Fidget Cube.  Now we have disassembled it, so <a href="http://madrobots.ru/p/fidget-cube/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dtop10_prodazh_dec">only pre-order</a> is available, new cubes will appear in early 2017. <br><br><h3>  Bobby - backpack for geeks </h3><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MiTD6Hs6HBk" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/madrobots/blog/282286/">We also described</a> this backpack, and in very great detail.  The creators of the backpack position it as "the best anti-theft backpack."  And indeed it is.  It is created from durable materials that are placed in layers.  There are no compartments outside - everything is located inside.  The upper layer is a stylish polyester fabric, followed by a 6 mm layer of anti-shock material (anti-shock), followed by several layers of fabric providing additional protection.  Inside - a lot of any departments that can serve to accommodate any gadgets (laptop, tablets, phone), thermos, stationery and much more.  Everything is thought out here to the smallest detail; it becomes immediately clear when you take a backpack in hand.  In general, if you were looking for a backpack for geeks, then <a href="http://madrobots.ru/p/xddesign-bobby/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dtop10_prodazh_dec">Bobby</a> is exactly what you need. <br><br><h3>  AquaFarm AquaFarm </h3><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BGdZrjPElco" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Aqua farm is a closed ecosystem with three main components.  This is water, fish and plants (well, yes, let's not forget about the aquarium itself).  Fish gives waste, which serve as food for plants.  Thanks to this system, you can get fresh herbs to the table all year round.  The water is cleaned in the aquarium by plants, and everyone feels good: the fish, the plants and the owner.  AquaFarm is produced in Russia.  The size of the aquarium is small - 30.5 x 29.5 cm. It fits both at home and in the office.  You can buy an aquarium in Russia from <a href="http://madrobots.ru/p/akvaferma-aquafarm/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dtop10_prodazh_dec">Madrobots</a> . <br><br><h3>  Tablet for drawing water Buddha Board </h3><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JNAXTJKENA0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  An interesting gadget that can serve as an excellent gift for both children and adults.  Here you need to paint not with paints, but with water, using a bamboo brush.  At the same time, several problems are solved at once: no paint is needed, no one is smeared, you can draw anywhere.  For the appearance of the image on Buddha Board Original, you need to hold a wet brush on the surface of the board.  Together with the slow evaporation of water, the pattern disappears, leaving you with a clear consciousness in front of a blank sheet.  Oriental advertising and contemplation - that's what Buddha Board is.  Well, actually it‚Äôs also great fun.  Of course, <a href="http://madrobots.ru/p/planshet-dlya-risovaniya-vodoy-buddha-board/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dtop10_prodazh_dec">you can</a> buy Buddha Board <a href="http://madrobots.ru/p/planshet-dlya-risovaniya-vodoy-buddha-board/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dtop10_prodazh_dec">from us</a> , at any time. <br><br><h3>  3D puzzle UGears Safe (Safe) </h3><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/T_QsF3JvDu8" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Ugears company produces 3D puzzles.  This is a new word in ‚Äúpuzzle-building‚Äù, where you collect not a picture with castles and princesses (well, or something else), but a three-dimensional structure with moving elements.  <a href="http://madrobots.ru/p/3d-pazl-ugears-seyf-safe/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dtop10_prodazh_dec">3D puzzle UGears Safe</a> - this is great fun.  After its assembly, you get a wooden safe with a combination lock, rotating handles and other attributes of this safe.  And yes, you can set the code on the lock.  All this easily turns into entertainment, when someone closes something in the safe, while others try, listening to the clicks of the lock, to open the safe and steal its contents.  The kit is made of plywood using a programmable laser machine: parts are easily extruded from the plates, almost no burrs are formed, all the inscriptions (driving modes, symbols, manufacturer's logo) are also applied with a laser.  In quality, these models are much superior to those made by stamping. <br><br><h3>  Smart Lamp Mipow Playbulb Lite </h3><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cpuxMxj1Y1s" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Systems like "smart home" in our time are becoming increasingly popular.  Moreover, the installation of various elements of such systems is simplified, you can not even turn the whole apartment into a smart one, but act gradually.  You can start with light bulbs.  <a href="http://madrobots.ru/p/mipow-playbulb-lite/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dtop10_prodazh_dec">The Mipow Playbulb Lite Smart Lamp</a> is a gadget that consists of a bright light source and a high-quality audio system.  The base is common here, E26 / E27, so you can use a light bulb almost everywhere.  You need to manage it using a special application via Bluetooth.  The price of Mipow Playbulb Lite, by the way, is lower than the price of many analogues.  If desired, you can change the brightness of the llama, color and some other parameters. <br><br><h3>  Bevan </h3><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7izLzfoiQ1Q" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  "Bevan" is a sofa that you can take with you on any journey.  This is, as we like to say, furniture out of thin air.  "Bivana" we do.  In May of the outgoing year, we collected more than three million rubles for the development of such systems, and launched their production.  Bevan weighs about 1500 grams and when folded it fits in a small shoulder bag, which is included in the kit.  Even the bag chair weighs more.  You can relax in it at the airport, outdoors, at home - yes, anywhere.  It is very convenient.  Well, and since we are the creators of this type of sofa, you can buy Bevan in <a href="http://madrobots.ru/p/bivan/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dtop10_prodazh_dec">the Madrobots store</a> . <br><br><h3>  Zavtra Wallet </h3><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/frr7MSYLzlo" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  One more thing that we have developed from scratch, and we are selling it.  More precisely, we have created not only this wallet, but also many other stylish accessories of the Zavtra brand.  We will write about the brand on Habr√© at the very beginning of 2017.  And now we‚Äôll tell only about the wallet, because it is in the top 10 of our sales. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2a4/0aa/754/2a40aa7544bf59e992846e8bf118bc83.jpg"><br><br>  There is no compartment for coins in it, but large and small cash will fit in for several days and plastic cards (4-5) needed every day, plus rights or a pass.  It is thin, you can wear it even in your pocket, even in your bag.  <a href="http://madrobots.ru/p/zavtra/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dtop10_prodazh_dec">Zavtra wallet</a> is also very comfortable and durable. <br><br><h3>  Test microscope for the determination of ovulation Ovulux </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/fec/5c2/4b7/fec5c24b71ae320112c358f5ee72e8d9.jpg"><br>  Surprised?  Everything is natural here, because this device is a reusable rapid test, which in a few minutes determines the phase of the menstrual cycle and the readiness of the female body to conceive.  The most interesting thing is that saliva serves as a test material.  A device the size of a tube of lipstick is a mini-microscope with glass lenses and stand-alone illumination.  With Ovulux, you no longer need to search for secluded places; you can conduct a test anywhere without being embarrassed by others.  For women with an irregular cycle, the <a href="http://madrobots.ru/p/test-mikroskop-dlya-opredeleniya-ovulyatsii-ovulux/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dtop10_prodazh_dec">Ovulux</a> rapid test is one of the most optimal ways to determine the current phase, because relying on calendar calculations is not safe in their case. <br><br><h3>  Smart Bracelet Xiaomi Mi Band 2 </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/23d/eb3/8a0/23deb38a0ecde78b7acfb3ed7dbfe412.png"><br>  Chinese manufacturers of gadgets from Xiaomi are ahead of the rest with their designs.  Not so long ago, they presented a smart fitness tracker, which, unlike the previous model, is equipped with a monochrone display.  This bracelet is small and light weight.  He is able to track the user's physical activity with high accuracy.  For example, it calculates the distance traveled by a person, calories expended.  There is also a smart alarm clock that tracks the phases of sleep and wakes a person at the most appropriate moment for it.  But the main update is the heart rate monitor!  Where can I buy Xiaomi Mi Band 2?  Well, you <a href="http://madrobots.ru/p/xiaomi-mi-band-2/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dtop10_prodazh_dec">guessed it</a> . <br><br>  PS we still thought about it and decided to write that <b>from December 31st to January 2nd (inclusive) we have weekends</b> , that is, non-working days.  At any other time, we are fully prepared to send you new great gadgets. <br><br> <a href="http://madrobots.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dtop10_prodazh_dec"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d29/4c3/07d/d294c307dde04335ac3f425e73b36a7a.gif"></a> <br> <a href="http://madrobots.ru/about/mails/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dtop10_prodazh_dec"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7fa/417/fe3/7fa417fe3d464fa5aa186b1ab30da53a.gif"></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/400265/">https://habr.com/ru/post/400265/</a></p>
