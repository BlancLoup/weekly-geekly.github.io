However, in English, punctuation differs significantly from what we are used to in Russian.  Moreover, it is different in different varieties of English. <br><br>  In general, there are a lot of difficult moments here that it can be difficult to deal with on your own.  I found an interesting <a href="https://textly.ai/blog/15-comma-rules-you-should-know-to-make-your-writing-better/">post</a> with the rules of using commas in English and examples of errors.

    <h2>  Rule # 1.  A comma is placed before a coordinating union that combines two sentences. </h2><br>  A group of words that can act as a separate sentence is called independent clause.  If you have two such objects that you want to combine in one more complex sentence with the help of the unions and, but, or, so and others, then it is important to put a comma before such a union. <br><br><blockquote>  I failed to find my size. </blockquote><br>  In the example above, both parts of a sentence may be separate sentences, but combined into one but.  If so, a comma is needed before it. <br><br><h2>  Rule # 2.  Commas are needed for transfers </h2><br>  If your proposal is a listing of some elements, they must be separated by commas. <br><br><blockquote>  John was obsessed with parties, girls, and sports cars. </blockquote><br>  At the same time, there are some subtleties.  For example, the use of the so-called Oxford comma (comma before and).  To put it or not depends on what dialect and style of English you use.  For example, Oxford comma is used in American English.  At the same time, there is the AP Style writing style guide, which was created for journalists and newspaper reporters, and it does not involve the use of Oxford comma. <br><br>  This is what can happen if you do not separate the items in the list with commas. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/cy/-c/sj/cy-csjxtc0z2vloa1x2rvjqzjck.png"><br><br>  <i>Source: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/1ah3lu/the_importance_of_commas/">Reddit</a></i> <br><br><h2>  Rule # 3.  Comma separates dependent and independent sentences </h2><br>  If your proposal consists of two, and one of them depends on the other and follows it, then you do not need to put a comma.  But if such a dependent clause is at the beginning, then after it you need to put a comma. <br><br><h4>  Examples: </h4><br><blockquote>  You are going to become a journalist.  (The dependent part comes after the one on which it depends, so a comma is not needed) <br><br>  If you‚Äôre going to become a journalist, you should read more.  (The sentence begins with the dependent part, so it will be correct to put a comma). </blockquote><br><h2>  Rule # 4.  Commas are placed after introductory words and word groups. </h2><br>  Sometimes at the beginning of a sentence there are separate introductory words (for example, however) or whole groups of words (on the other hand).  The reasons for their use may be different, it usually allows the reader to prepare for the main part of the sentence.  The rule states that such introductory words and groups of words should be separated by a comma. <br><br><blockquote>  Finally, I had enough money to buy this car. </blockquote><br>  <b>Tip</b> : Adverbs are usually used as introductory words, many of which end in -ly.  So if your first word in a sentence is a word in -ly, you will need to put a comma after it. <br><br><h2>  Rule # 5.  The comma is placed in sentences that begin with "Yes" or "No" </h2><br>  One of the simplest rules of English punctuation.  If the sentence begins with yes or no, then a comma follows.  It's simple. <br><br><blockquote>  Yes, I'd like to have some more ice cream. </blockquote><br><h2>  Rule # 6.  A comma is placed if you need to interrupt the offer in order to provide additional information. </h2><br>  When your sentence is interrupted by a phrase that is not grammatically related to it, it must be separated with commas. <br><br><blockquote>  This car I told you about the audio system that was bought by some banker. </blockquote><br>  It is very important to follow this rule if you want to avoid embarrassing situations when writing: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fa/8a/17/fa8a17_exjhqn1ixikoc6monu4s.png"><br><br>  <i>Source: <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/euugy/the_value_of_a_comma/">Reddit</a></i> <br><br><h2>  Rule # 7.  Commas are put under direct quotation. </h2><br>  Another simple rule.  If you see a direct quote, without hesitation put a comma. <br><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúI'd rather die than accept this job offer,‚Äù she told her friend. </blockquote><br>  Again, as in the case of Oxford comma, the exact use of quotation marks and commas will depend on the style used.  In American English, it is customary to put a comma inside quotation marks, while the British often put it after. <br><br><h2>  Rule # 8.  Commas are separated by address elements. </h2><br>  If you need to write down the exact address, including the number of the house with the street, city, state, you need to separate them with commas. <br><br><blockquote>  Our new office is located at 350 Lincoln Road, Miami Beach, FL 33139. </blockquote><br><h2>  Rule # 9.  Items are separated by commas in dates. </h2><br>  Similarly, when you write a date with the day of the week, month, date and year, they are all separated by commas. <br><br><blockquote>  Sunday, March 3, 2019, we've finally launched our Chrome and Firefox browser extensions. <br></blockquote><br>  <b>Tip</b> : After the date itself, a comma is also put - it will separate it from the rest of the sentence.  However, if the date consists only of a day and a month, then commas are not necessary as a separator. <br><br><h2>  Rule # 10.  Commas are also used in job descriptions. </h2><br>  If the sentence immediately after the name of a person mentions his position, then this mention should be separated by commas: <br><br><blockquote>  Kimberly Johnson, a TV host </blockquote><br><h2>  Rule # 11.  Commas are used in numbers consisting of more than four digits. <br></h2><br>  If you need to write a number consisting of more than four digits, then commas should be divided into groups of three digits.  Counting is conducted from right to left. <br><br><blockquote>  <b>That's right</b> : 50,000 <br><br>  False: 55,000.00 </blockquote><br><h2>  Rule # 12.  Commas are put when using negatives. </h2><br>  If your sentence contains negation, it should be separated by commas. <br><br><blockquote>  I went to Barcelona for my vacation this year. </blockquote><br>  <b>Advice</b> : even if the negation is at the end, and not in the middle of a sentence, a comma is still needed. <br><br><h2>  Rule # 13.  The address is comma-delimited. </h2><br>  The rule is similar to the Russian language.  In direct circulation, a comma is placed before it. <br><br><blockquote>  You should allow more privacy on Facebook, Mark. </blockquote><br>  If this is not done, an unpleasant situation may arise: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/yr/um/_4/yrum_4c-kfwsiwqhbujsyiga4fi.png"><br><br>  <i>Source: <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/148rn5/not_the_same_without_a_comma_man/">Reddit</a></i> <br><br><h2>  Rule # 14.  Comma adjectives are separated by commas. </h2><br>  If two adjectives in a sentence independently characterize a noun, they are called coordinating (coordinate adjectives).  They should be separated by commas. <br><br>  If you can insert a union and between such adjectives or swap them without losing the meaning of the sentence, then these are coordinating adjectives, and a comma is needed between them. <br><br><blockquote>  Travel is a fun way to spend your time.  (You can insert ‚Äúand‚Äù between adjectives or swap them without losing meaning). </blockquote><br><h2>  Rule # 15.  Commas are put when using adjective adjectives </h2><br>  In English, there is the concept of appositive adjective - these are descriptions that are used to emphasize a noun or pronoun, and usually follow them in a sentence.  Such adjectives are separated by commas. <br><br><blockquote>  She was always loved. </blockquote><br>  Such constructions in colloquial speech are not common.  Usually they are used in fiction or in scientific publications.  They make the text more cumbersome and make reading more difficult, therefore it is generally not recommended to use them. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/453366/">https://habr.com/ru/post/453366/</a></p>
