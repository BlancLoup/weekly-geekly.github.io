The question that I hear from every second advertiser concerns the lack of understanding of the basic principle of working in context - the need to target their advertising to the target audience as clearly as possible. <br><br>  Under the cut an attempt is available to answer such questions. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>Question:</b> Why is the ‚Äúair conditioners‚Äù query that I have chosen worse than the ‚Äúsale of Panasonic air conditioners‚Äù that you proposed?  I'm paying for clicks, right?  If a person is not interested in my ad - he will not click and the money will remain intact.  So let the ad be shown to the whole universe !!!  I want a lot of clients !!!

      <b>Answer: The</b> request "air conditioners", at first glance, is not bad, but it is non-selling.  The fact is that any of the huge number of seekers can complement it, for example, ‚ÄúPanasonic Air Conditioner XXX 100500 model‚Äù.  If you do not have air conditioners of this brand for sale, there is no point in displaying an ad.  Also, a huge reservoir of users is looking for repair of air conditioners, installation of air conditioners, instructions for air conditioners, services for refueling air conditioners, air conditioning in the car (about 170 requests in total, which are very indirectly related to the business of selling air conditioners) <br><br>  By showing your ad to this entire untargeted audience, you get one of two negative phenomena. <br>  <b>a) single click.</b>  The user was looking for repair of air conditioners, saw your ad, (clicked consciously or by mistake) did not see anything about the repair of air conditioners, spent time and went away furiously under his breath.  He did not receive an answer to your question, you did not receive the sale.  Poorly. <br>  <b>b) idle show.</b>  The user saw that the repair in the ad and does not smell, and went to look at the issue further.  CTR drops.  The lower your CTR, the higher the cost per click.  In the end, with your low CTR, you will pay for the total untargeted garbage traffic at times more than your more savvy competitors with high CTR pay for hot clients from the same Direct.  Again, bad. <br><br>  Why so invented?  Why is CTR a criterion? <br>  Judge for yourself.  There are 2 advertisers.  One perfectly tuned RK to its target audience, has a CTR of 20% (advertising is relevant to the request) The second followed a simple path and bought the word ‚Äúair conditioner‚Äù, as a result has a CTR of 1% (advertising is not relevant relevant to the request).  Naturally, the first advertiser, besides providing relevant information to the user ‚Äî also gives Yandex more profit ‚Äî and needs to be rewarded ‚Äî to lower the cost of a click.  And to the second, we will do something like a fine so that it does not unscrew it in vain with its worthless RK on the excellent selling Yandex issuing sites and not mislead users with its irrelevant information. <br><br>  Remember - the technique of carpet bombing to which we are used in the case of advertising on TV and billboards in the context does not work.  The sniper rifle shooting technique is important here.  If the main criterion for choosing a billboard is its permeability (‚Äúfor as many people as possible to see, maybe our clients will be among them‚Äù), then in the context of the main criterion for choosing a keyword is that only clients and as few as non-clients see it. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/98997/">https://habr.com/ru/post/98997/</a></p>
