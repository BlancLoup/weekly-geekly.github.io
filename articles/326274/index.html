  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The flagship line of Cisco Wi-Fi appeared in Russia</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In February of this year, in Russia, the Cisco Aironet 2800 and 3800 series access points were opened for order ‚Äî Cisco's flagship portfolio with support for the 802.11ac Wave 2 standard. These products allow you to achieve unprecedented Wi-Fi performance of 5.2 Gb / s.  Production of access points of series 2800, 3800 is located in Russia, in the city of Tver. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4b8/2bf/566/4b82bf5660b34f46ab5434d02ac06360.png"></div><br>  The Cisco Aironet 2800 and 3800 Series are designed for reliable, long lasting and high performance. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Design </h3><br>  Traditionally, for advanced access points, Cisco develops a hardware platform (chipset) on its own.  Cisco adheres to this strategy in the third generation of access points, and all in order to present the market a number of unique innovations, which will be discussed later. <br><br>  The new generation of access points has an even more perfect design: the plastic of the case is even more durable and resistant to treatment with the means used by medical and children's institutions.  Screens are installed between the internal elements to reduce interactions of radio elements inside the case.  The heat inside the point is distributed evenly, so that when it is working it is barely warm, despite the lack of ventilation holes.

      Access points of the 2800, 3800 series have high reliability, can survive in the conditions of interferences, temperature variation, microwave radiation of furniture factories, in multi-storey buildings. <br><br>  The points have a distributed duplicated architecture using processors with a frequency of 1.8 GHz, which gives them the right to be called the most productive access points in the industry. <br><br>  The dots support operation on 160 MHz channels, as defined by 802.11ac Wave 2. <br><br>  The 3800 Series has a slot for future modules, and this is important because  functional needs are changing dynamically.  Modules developed by both Cisco and technology partners will appear in the future. <br><br><h3>  Innovation </h3><br>  <b>- Flexible Radio Assignment (FRA) or flexible assignment of one of the radio bands</b> <br>  In the traditional version, the Wi-Fi access point operates in 2 bands - 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz.  However, today we are increasingly seeing the need for networks with a high density of clients, when the number of access points is determined by the number of client devices, and not by the radius of coverage.  In practice, in such networks, the 2.4 GHz band has to be turned off, since  Due to limited spectrum, there is a high level of interference.  At the same time, in the 5GHz range, 5 times the spectrum is available, and the performance due to 802.11ac modulations is much higher. <br><br><img align="right" src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8ea/e98/b8c/8eae98b8c12c447fb7749e067e06b220.JPG">  The number of devices operating in 5GHz is growing steadily.  The experience of holding Cisco Live 2017 in Berlin is indicative, where more than 14,000 people simultaneously connected to the Wi-Fi network, of which 92.5% used the 5 GHz band.  Below are the key numbers on Wi-Fi connections at the event in 2016 and 2017: <br><br>  Cisco Live 2017 was the first Cisco event to offer guaranteed coverage only at 5 GHz. <br><br>  <b>Flexible Radio Assignment</b> allows you to flexibly assign a radio, previously used only for 2.4GHz operation, for operation at 5GHz and in monitor mode (listening to the air to control its use and detect air attacks). <br><br>  So  dual-use 5 GHz mode with one access point is possible!  Instead of turning off 2.4 GHz, now this radio can be turned on at 5 GHz, adding performance to the network. <br><br><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2b0/75d/537/2b075d537e55435ab7303baebffaaa1b.JPG">  In addition, <b>Flexible Radio Assignment</b> provides ample opportunities for installation - 2x radio antennas can be both internal and external.  When using the option with internal antennas, you can define the first radio as a macro cell, and the second as a micro cell.  In this mode, two radios will operate with different powers in different coverage areas.  The effect of the highest performance in a certain room is achieved, at the same time there is also coverage in the areas around. <br><br>  <b>Flexible Radio Assignment</b> technology is a breakthrough success for Cisco developers.  Previously, such solutions did not work - too small a distance between radio transmitters operating in the same range created significant interference inside the device and the overall performance of the dual radio solution did not exceed the performance of the standard one.  Today, dual radio at 5 GHz is a reality.  This is achieved by maximizing the separation and shielding of radio elements inside the case.  Spectrally, both radios are separated by not less than 100 MHz, the benefit of the spectrum allocated today for Wi-Fi, this allows. <br><br>  At Cisco Live 2017 in Berlin, the Aironet Access Point Series was first used for high-density coverage on a large-scale facility and proved to be great.  The following picture was observed in the Keynote Arena area: <br><br><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6f9/1d7/516/6f91d7516d8f44d4963e8aac24a48713.JPG">  There are extremely few included interfaces in 2.4 GHz, at the same time 5 GHz is actively used, points in the dual 5 GHz mode. <br><br>  Since  a high-density customer coverage scenario was implemented, directional antennas were actively used.  There can be 2 access points to each access point thanks to the Smart Antenna port. <br>  For installation options, see the examples from Cisco Live 2017 in Berlin: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/686/38b/09a/68638b09acc043ec932a16a1e9465fe2.jpg"><br><br><img align="right" src="https://habrastorage.org/files/849/3bc/099/8493bc099e794d8687e312132718d37b.jpg">  <b>- CleanAir</b> <br>  Cleanair is a spectral analyzer built into the access point, more specifically into the Cisco chipset.  CleanAir will detect a wireless video camera, someone else's access point, or any non-Wi-Fi device operating in the Wi-Fi range.  As a result, the system administrator has a noise map on the timeline, assessing the impact of interference on the quality of the air and network performance, and also when determining the threshold values ‚Äã‚Äãof these parameters, the network will start reconfiguring to cleaner channels, adapting the channel width and radiation power of each access point if necessary. <br>  Now CleanAir works in 160 MHz channels. <br><br>  <b>- Clientlink</b> <br>  Cisco's patented beamforming technology that improves the performance of 802.11ac client devices and previous standards.  The client device essentially tells the access point how to amplify the signal to it in the best way. <br>  Now the technology supports wide channels and MU-MIMO. <br><br>  <b>Materials</b> <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ <a href="http://www.cisco.com/c/dam/global/ru_ru/about/brochures/assets/pdfs/cisco_dna_mobility_flexible_radio_assignment_aag.pdf">Cisco Flexible Radio Assignment</a> <br>  ‚Ä¢ <a href="http://www.cisco.com/assets/global/RU/about/brochures/cisco_aironet_2800_datasheet.pdf">Cisco Aironet 2800 Series Access Points</a> <br>  ‚Ä¢ <a href="http://www.cisco.com/assets/global/RU/about/brochures/cisco_aironet_3800_datasheet.pdf">Cisco Aironet 3800 Series Access Points</a> <br>  ‚Ä¢ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DdBpGsTKeyNM%26t%3D64s">Presentation of Cisco Aironet 3800 Design Features (Eng.)</a> <br>  ‚Ä¢ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DcUHPMwdo9fo">Aironet 2800 access point performance test with hundreds of laptops (Eng.)</a> <br>  ‚Ä¢ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DmbpjiETvDXc">Testing work on two channels in 5GHz Cisco Dual 5GHz Wi-Fi (English)</a> <br>  ‚Ä¢ <a href="http://nsashow.com/FRA/">Test No Strings Attached Show</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/326274/">https://habr.com/ru/post/326274/</a></p>
