  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Making a home radio field ‚Äúcleaner‚Äù on the example of Wi-Fi networks</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  After reading a recent <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/beeline/blog/132169/">article</a> , I decided to think about what is happening around us, in fact, in the range of frequencies that we cannot sense with our own organs of perception.  I did not go far and decided to turn to our smaller friend, the favorite of many: from small to large - this is the holy Wi-Fi router. <br><br>  Today, it will not be surprising for anyone (except for infants and the elderly) to have at least one Wi-Fi network in the space of any apartment building.  The use of routers for home / work purposes with each unit of time does not increase arithmetically, but almost exponentially, which can be a key role in some situations, for which you want to be prepared for various cases. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  But after all, what a bad luck: one can hardly meet a person from his home who would be at least somehow aware of modern technologies and, most importantly, of the equipment used.  Of course, I myself, like these many (well, I clearly don‚Äôt hide a sin), I don‚Äôt know too much, but still, I don‚Äôt understand the case completely.  Therefore, it is very, very difficult on the fingers to tell a person that this ‚Äúmagic box with antennas‚Äù is not a harmless device.  Naturally, Wi-Fi networks are not diabolical cordons, and routers are not those green orcs that we don‚Äôt like so much, but if you think about it, it‚Äôs still more pleasant to live not surrounded by 10-20 points, which are also locked (with a break for fans of the ‚Äúfreebie‚Äù internet), but with a clean field, when you can catch only the SSID of a point from a neighbor opposite. <br><br>  Actually, the problem of convincing people about what to do the way you want has always been sideways for the majority, and therefore you need to look for approaches.  You can stand in the middle of the courtyard and shout that all radio devices are harmful and let's not use them, you can ‚Äúwalk‚Äù through the apartments of all the neighbors and give everyone an hour-long lecture about the dangers of these notorious devices, or you can do a small article on a simple sheet of paper, hanging at the entrance to the entrance.  As a rule, there are few people who do not fall under the category of those who are not interested (much depends on what is written on this sheet of paper at the entrance), so suppose that we took the first step successfully and move on.

      So, revealing the topic in a bit more detail, it is worth noting that my position may not be entirely or not at all true, but no one has yet canceled the freedom of speech.  Having told the tenants that Wi-Fi is harmful, that it can interfere with devices of various kinds, and that wires are generally better (not without humor), let us consider an example of the complete lack of advantages in the presence of several networks within reach.  Many people (not all, but such a lot more than half) and have no idea that the router can be configured and do so in connection with their needs.  We will not consider everything, but we will take into account only the parameters relating to the power, time of the network identifier broadcasting and the type of network. <br><br>  At present, the most common standard of 802.11 <b>g</b> networks: it is literally in all devices (if you are not a fan of retro technology) and is the most optimal and fast.  There is of course the standard 802.11 <b>n</b> , which can be useful to you only when two devices interact on the network in the role of transferring files from one device to another, so its use is very rare, since for the life of a mere mortal there is enough speed for the local network 54mbit.  Of course, you can lower the maximum speed for the network, but this, in my opinion, is superfluous. <br><br>  The second parameter we consider the power of broadcasting a wireless network.  For home use, we are more than enough for a weak signal / medium signal (I personally use the weak one, since the maximum remote point of the apartment from the router is 6 meters away, counting the walls).  If you don‚Äôt rush around with the laptop all over the apartment, hiding from the air behind the fridge, trying to download the just-released movie from the torrent tracker, then a weak signal is enough with a margin. <br><br>  The period of sending information about a network to free air can also be extended, since the home network obviously does not need a permanent sign of its presence, so that you can save on this.  Depending on the manufacturer / model / router / firmware, there is a different set of detailed settings for both the wireless network itself and the settings for wireless broadcasting of the router as a whole, so you need to analyze more details for different models, which requires a separate topic. <br><br>  So, having come up with the option of notifying people and a brief description or walking around the apartments and setting up the devices, we find that, guided by a small briefcase, and in fact, a brochure from the information about the device Wi-Fi wireless networks, we can clear our local air from garbage ‚Äùof unnecessary signal from other networks and points, while making not so much effort (not counting its unique neighbors, with which to argue is unfortunately useless, due to various factors that prevent them from being in solidarity with you). <br><br>  Maybe the topic is rather meaningless, if we disassemble it scientifically and technically, but in certain situations or the specifics of our stay, sometimes the absence of other people's networks in the available range is very useful for a specific situation that some of us may encounter (I personally encountered it, but don‚Äôt tell I will, because it goes beyond the bounds of adequacy, the benefit is not of me, but of a person who needed to present everything in a form different from his misunderstanding). </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/132483/">https://habr.com/ru/post/132483/</a></p>
