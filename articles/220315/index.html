The company's activities in this direction are very diverse - from luring developers of popular Android applications and introducing their own currency to developing an in-house game studio and launching cross-platform statistics for applications. <br><br>  In our opinion, having an own ‚Äúpiece of iron‚Äù always plays an important role in creating an ecosystem.  Until recently, Amazon‚Äôs entire business for the application market was built around various modifications of the Kindle tablet.  However, according to recent reports (still at the level of rumors), the company is seriously thinking about entering the smartphone market.

      Moreover, the <a href="http://www.techfaster.com/first-look-amazons-3d-smartphone/">new product of the company</a> , whose photos have already ‚Äúleaked‚Äù to the Network, is positioned as a 3D smartphone.  Announcement of the device is expected at the end of June.  It will be interesting to watch its distribution - Amazon will actively use only its channels or, finally, make a breakthrough towards the ‚Äúmass market‚Äù. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Unity bought a startup of mobile analytics Playnomics </h4><br>  Unity continues to behave aggressively in the mobile development market.  Following the absorption of the Applifter service, which offers a platform for recording and sharing video from mobile games, Unity acquired a start-up called Playnomics, which represents analytics for mobile developers. <br><br>  The purchase price is not disclosed, and both parties do not comment on the transaction. <br>  Playnomics won the VentureBeat - Who's Got Game competition at the GamesBeat 2010. In February 2013 Playnomics raised $ 5 million from Vanedge Capital, and before that Accelerator Ventures, Metamorphic Ventures and TriplePoint Capital invested in the company.  A total of Playnomics raised $ 8.2 million. <br><br>  Currently, Playnomics handles billions of game events per month, and the services of the service are used by games with millions of monthly active players. <br><br>  This deal confirms Unity‚Äôs desire to become the only all-in-one platform for mobile developers.  We are waiting for the absorption (or launch) of something in the spirit of HockeyApp? <br><br><h4>  King goes to China with Tencent </h4><br>  King will launch one of the most successful mobile games in the world, Candy Crush Saga in <a href="http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2014-04-16-king-partners-with-tencent-to-distribute-candy-crush-in-china">China,</a> with the help of local internet giant Tencent.  The Chinese version of the game will be available through Tencent's Mobile QQ and Weixin Game Centers. <br><br>  At the moment, King has 324 million active players per month, and launching in China will allow the company to receive hundreds of millions of new players! <br><br>  Enlisting the support of Tencent, King is strengthening in the Asian markets: in 2013, Candy Crush Saga was launched in Japan and South Korea.  China is a very important move for a company that can brighten up disappointment from a not very successful IPO. <br><br><h4>  Twitter launched a mobile application ad </h4><br>  Twitter <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/2014/a-new-way-to-promote-mobile-apps-to-1-billion-devices-both-on-and-off-twitter">announced</a> the launch of its own advertising network Twitter Publisher Network.  Like Facebook, Twitter will allow you to publish advertising tweets with links to mobile apps in the middle of the tweet feed. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7aa/5f1/701/7aa5f170198e98e6804e7d67a998fa32.png"><br><br>  This solution is technologically based on the MoPub network purchased last year.  With its help, advertisers will be able to show ads not only to 241 million of its users, but also the billionth user base of MoPub Marketplace. <br><br>  Again, by analogy with Facebook, Twitter provides advertisers with a whole set of tools for conducting and measuring promotions.  Now the solution works in closed beta mode.  Companies such as Spotify, Kabam and GREE are testing it. <br><br><br><h4>  AppAnnie published a report for the 1st quarter of 2014 </h4><br>  AppAnnie has published a new report on the mobile market in the first quarter of 2014.  You can view the full version here (http://blog.appannie.com/app-annie-index-market-q1-2014/).  And we, by tradition, will tell about the most interesting, in our opinion, moments. <br><br>  By downloading apps all over the world, Google Play is ahead of the App Store by 45%.  This result is associated with countries where the market for Android devices is growing at a good pace: Russia, Brazil, Mexico and Turkey. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cc3/c07/b24/cc3c07b24bfd096fc681968e44a61ee9.png"><br><br>  At the same time, the App Store still brings more money than Google Play.  In the first quarter of this year, the Apple app store brought in 85% more money than Google Play. <br><br>  The Chinese App Store has shown the largest growth in both downloads and revenue.  In the first quarter, revenue increased by 70%.  In February, 1 million new Phone-users appeared in the country. <br><br>  Games - the most popular and earning category in both stor.  Messengers continue to show growth and are gaining more and more top positions in the tops of Communication categories on Google Play and Social Networking on the App Store. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/220315/">https://habr.com/ru/post/220315/</a></p>
