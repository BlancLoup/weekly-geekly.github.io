  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Explay CMS 2.1</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="http://explay.su/images/articles/1213470753_1.jpg" alt="Explay CMS"><br>  Well, it seems this time has come.  Explay CMS 2.1 release.  To download, you must first visit the <a href="http://alex-home.spb.ru/explay.html">promo page</a> , but it is better to read to the end :) <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Introduction </h2><br>  Since the release of version 2.0, almost 4 months have passed, and I can assure you: it was not for nothing.  Every day I was convinced that I couldn‚Äôt program in PHP and every day I tried to fix it.  Corrected everything I could, within reasonable compatibility of versions :) In principle, only part of the structure of tables in the data meringue remained from the old one, the engine was rewritten completely, and in some places even several times. <br><br><h2>  The main thing </h2><br><img src="http://explay.su/images/admin/update.jpg" align="right">  The main thing, as you might think, is not a completely rewritten code, not UTF-8, not a new admin panel design, not even an attempt to comply with MVC.  The main thing for which I actually did and release 2.1 is a system of updates.  System updates in the full sense of the word.  From now on, you don‚Äôt have to manually replace the updated files, you just have to click one or two buttons and update the CMS to the latest version.  Previously, it was the privilege of paid boxed (with rare exceptions) site management systems, now the secretary has the opportunity to update Explay CMS :) 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      It should be noted that the update process is rather uncommon, simple and, at the same time, stable from the technical side.  Therefore, I hope he will find his place in other free CMS. <br><br><h2>  About new </h2><br><img src="http://explay.su/21_table.jpg" align="right" alt="Explay CMS">  In the user interface from version 2.0, almost nothing has changed, a ratings module has been added, a profile has been expanded, a search has been created and the ability to save articles into drafts has been created, the rest is trivial.  Administrators were lucky a little more, now they have a custom desktop and a new ‚Äúglamorous‚Äù design. <br><br>  Besides users, I really wanted to improve the lives of programmers, so I rewrote (in some places I limited myself to refractoring) and commented on all the code.  The database itself has slightly improved, which made it possible to slightly reduce the number of requests and improve performance.  Considering that the PLO and the parodies of MVC did not write much <a href="http://explay.su/documentation.htm">documentation either</a> . <br><br>  Those who will install Explay CMS from scratch are waited by the ‚Äúinstallation wizard‚Äù, which will check the server configuration, as well as set up the rights to files and folders. <br><br><h2>  Openness to developers </h2><br>  Now the current version of the code can be viewed and downloaded from <a href="http://code.google.com/p/explay-cms">SVN</a> to Google Code.  And I really hope that after the release of this release there will be people who will directly participate in the development of Explay CMS and <a href="http://explay.su/">the development community</a> will reach a new level. <br><br><h2>  List of changes regarding version 2.0 </h2><ol><li>  Created update system </li><li>  UTF-8 </li><li>  Article modules rewritten </li><li>  RSS feed for all comments </li><li>  Created search for articles </li><li>  The user‚Äôs page can now be accessed by username (similarly to the user‚Äôs blog) </li><li>  Added kernel, modified database classes and templates </li><li>  3 new classes were written: User, explayFroms, imageResize </li><li>  Absolutely new template engine </li><li>  Added the ability to create static variables for templates </li><li>  Added exceptions to the MySQL class, which allows to determine the real location of the error </li><li>  Most of the code is commented </li><li>  Optimized <b>all</b> code, including the admin part </li><li>  API &amp; AJAX moved to modules and work like them </li><li>  Now uses the AJAX engine from jQuery </li><li>  Small user avatars are now cached, not created every time. </li><li>  Changed adminpanel design </li><li>  In the same admin panel now customizable desktop </li><li>  Created a quick search for article titles </li><li>  New fields added to user profile: dota birth and gender </li><li>  Added the ability to change the password </li><li>  Articles now can be saved in drafts </li><li>  Created installer that checks file permissions and server configuration </li><li>  In the basic package comes Sape plugin </li><li>  Site settings are cleaned and transferred from a table to a database in a PHP file </li><li>  The new unit for the module "People" </li><li>  Includes the latest version of TinyMCE </li><li>  All version 2.0 bugs fixed </li></ol><br><h2>  Upgrade from version 2.0 to 2.1 </h2><br>  To my regret, I was not able to achieve full compatibility of the two versions.  Of course there is an update file, but it only updates the structure of the tables in the database.  The main problem with updating is waiting for you in the templates:  Template maker has changed, no old template will work under 2.1.  If you did not change the <strike>floor of the</strike> standard design, then you are lucky - just replace the templates, and if you created your design ... <br><br>  With the encoding UTF-8, you may also have to tinker.  Despite the fact that there is a file that changes the coding of the database tables, it is better to err and make a full backup. <br><br><h2>  Plans </h2><br>  Soon I plan to close the 2nd branch and start developing from scratch to create a normal architecture.  <strike>And now I'm going to drink beer.</strike> <br><br>  <strong>For bug reports there is a community, my e-mail and personal mail on Habr√©.</strong> <br><br><h6><br>  I‚Äôm waiting for objective criticism, not phrases like: ‚ÄúEverything should be rewritten under ZF - shit code!‚Äù.  If you think so - justify. </h6><br><blockquote>  Related Links: <br>  <a href="http://alex-home.spb.ru/explay.html">Promotional page</a> - download Explay cms and hosting requirements <br>  <a href="http://explay.su/">Developer community</a> <br>  <a href="http://code.google.com/p/explay-cms">Google Code Project</a> <br>  <a href="http://explay.su/documentation.htm">Documentation</a> <br>  <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explay_cms">Wikipedia article</a> <br></blockquote></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/37795/">https://habr.com/ru/post/37795/</a></p>
