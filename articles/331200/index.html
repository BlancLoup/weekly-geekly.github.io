Synopsis under the cut. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/d88/6aa/704/d886aa704abf4f1aae04f75c2852c31b.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The company <a href="https://playdisplay.com/ru/">Playdisplay</a> appeared 6 years ago and was one of the first in the field of augmented reality.  Its co-founder and creative director <b>Andrei Sudarikov has been</b> engaged in graphic design for 20 years. <br>  The name Playdisplay consists of two words - <i>‚Äúplay‚Äù and ‚Äúshow‚Äù.</i>

      It all started with augmented reality cards using ARToolKit technology.  They were square black and white, similar to QR codes.  At that time, it was not possible to perceive markers of absolutely any kind.  With the help of these cards, a project was made for the children's Gaidar Library.  There was no mobile augmented reality and <b>Playdisplay</b> did it for stationary computers with an external webcam. <br><br>  <i>At one of the youth forums, the company's founders met with the governor of the Astrakhan region and showed him their portfolio, and subsequently received an order for a project for the planetarium.</i> <br><br>  One of the first major projects was the installation for the Garage Museum.  She visually showed how the temporary architecture looked in Gorky Park.  An augmented reality mobile application was made that demonstrated the lost architecture of the park when you hover your mobile device on the map.  This project saw <b>Dmitry Medvedev</b> . <br><br>  One of the clients of Playdisplay is the holding ‚ÄúAirports of the Regions‚Äù.  Companies needed installations for exhibitions in different cities and countries.  At the aviation forum in Chicago attended CEO of Changi Airport from Singapore, who liked the installation of PlayDisplay very much.  After 2 years, Changi employees turned to PlayDisplay with a request to make a similar installation in Singapore. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Project video:</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xJVlaS4mKeI" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br></div></div><br><br>  A little later, the company presented its products to <b>Vladimir Putin</b> at the Seliger forum. <br><br>  When you work with the first persons, it is important to consider that you will always have very little time to prepare, you will not have a second chance to make a first impression - everything should work perfectly. <br><br>  Another of the Playdisplay cases is a museum in Astana.  In an empty space with the help of a virtual reality helmet can be viewed various exhibits.  The contacts that the company has developed on this project led her to Nursultan Nazarbayev.  PlayDisplay received an order to create an installation for the new ice arena.  For 8 days of work, the team was able to make a six-minute mapping show with a display of the history of Kazakh hockey, as well as create an installation with augmented reality.  The viewer saw himself on the screen, and on the table - a three-dimensional model in augmented reality.  A customer representative asked the day before the presentation: <i>‚ÄúWhy do I see myself here?</i>  <i>Mr. President may not like it, ‚Äù</i> and we had to redo the project overnight, eliminating the augmented reality algorithm from it. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/645/da1/13c/645da113c8f64d71ace24f65581646f3.jpg"></div><br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Project video:</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/T9azKFZtl2Y" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br></div></div><br><br>  There are nuances that can be understood only with experience.  For example, during one of the inspections of the object, the FSO discovered that the sticker on the exhibit table was made of highly toxic plastic and this almost ruined the entire project.  It is important to understand that the project is not only the code that runs on a particular device, but all the experience that occurs when you come into contact with your product. <br><br>  <i>It often happens that there is a gulf between development and real communication with people to whom it will be heard.</i>  <i>What is needed for your project to pay attention?</i> <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0066cc">Special offer</font> </h2><br>  It's not just about marketing and advertising, but generally about any product and any development.  Creating a unique product will give impetus not only to the promotion of your business, but also to your personal growth.  Realize what is your uniqueness and how to submit it correctly.  Then exhibitions, corporations, any doors and opportunities will be open for you. <br><br>  <i>What is the uniqueness of Playdisplay?</i> <br><br>  <b>Design and branding.</b>  The company aims to solve the most important tasks of the client looking at them precisely through the prism of branding and marketing. <br>  <b>Game and emotions.</b>  Projects do not just show something, but involve a person in the process, evoking emotions. <br>  <b>Novelty, technology and creativity.</b>  The use of new technologies: virtual and augmented reality. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/e7d/9d8/ac9/e7d9d8ac90e843c8b09036c856e78265.jpg"></div><br><br>  Each company can, following the example above, identify for themselves some unique directions and begin to develop and promote them.  Focus on them and you will get a lot. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0066cc">Stakeholders</font> </h2><br>  Individuals or companies that in some way have an impact on what you are doing.  All those who come into contact with your product.  You need to understand who they are and what they need.  Consider the experience of Playdisplay in interacting with presidential projects. <br><br><ul><li>  Playdisplay </li><li>  Company customer </li><li>  Customer Company Manager </li><li>  Manager Leader </li><li>  Shareholders of the customer </li><li>  Event Site Administrators </li><li>  Administration of the President </li><li>  Presidential team </li><li>  FSO </li><li>  The president </li><li>  The Philistines </li></ul><br>  It all looks like chaos.  There are not two points of contact: the <b>customer is the performer</b> .  In fact, they are much more.  Considering all these actors, we can think of a solution so that it meets the interests of the customer, and not the manager, for example.  So that it meets the requirements of the president, but does not contradict the requirements of the FSO. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0066cc">Transaction cycle</font> </h2><br>  If we talk about projects where you need to prepare for a long time, these are complicated transactions.  To get an order, you need to communicate with someone, someone should recommend you.  There are many intermediate steps that you should consider.  In fact, the chain looks like this: <br><br>  PR (sundress, exhibitions, site, SMM) - Acquaintance - Commercial offer 1 version - Competition - Commercial offer 2 version - Agreement - Commercial offer 3 version - Tender - Contract - Technical task - Development - Delivery - Presentation - Repeat requests <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/b9b/e95/451/b9be9545141d469397ccc105d433dae5.jpg"><br><br>  It is very important to be present at the presentation in order not to lose the point of contact with the client.  It is very important to keep your name and move your brand wherever possible.  It is he who will form a cloud of opportunities for you. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0066cc">Stages of development</font> </h2><br>  They should know and be able to properly present to the client your employees: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/ef0/e50/477/ef0e504774bf43d1a9a7ac50959821f3.jpg"><br><br><h2>  <font color="#0066cc">Why do you do this?</font> </h2><br>  <i>The main question that you should always ask yourself.</i>  <i>This leads to global awareness, and it, in turn, leads to a happy life and prosperity of your companies.</i> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/cfb/88c/fd3/cfb88cfd36b24803849185c86a133cc7.jpg"></div><br><br>  In the near future, we will post on our blog on Habrahabr summaries of the remaining lectures from the VR-Today virtual reality conference.  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/miip/">Subscribe</a> to get notified when they exit. <br><br>  In the fall, we start training on our educational program ‚ÄúGame Project Management‚Äù, we invite you to <a href="http://hsbi.hse.ru/events/open_days/den-otkrytykh-dverey-po-programmam-igrovoy-industrii-28-06-2017/">open doors</a> on June 28! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/331200/">https://habr.com/ru/post/331200/</a></p>
