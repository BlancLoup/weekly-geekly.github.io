Talented programmers from all over the world will again compete in the correctness and speed of solving problems and will compete for a prize fund of 750 thousand rubles. <br><br>  The main program of the Russian Code Cup (RCC) traditionally consists of three stages: three qualifying rounds (April 2, April 16 and April 29), the qualifying round (May 14) and the final (September 10).  At each stage, participants will have to solve from four to eight diverse tasks.  Those who are unlucky in the first qualifying round may try their luck in the following.  The best 200 participants from each qualification will pass to the qualifying round, and 50 best programmers will come together in the final. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Championship winner will get the main cash prize of 150,000 rubles.  For the second and third place, the contestants will receive 100 and 65 thousand rubles, respectively.  For places from the fourth to the tenth, a prize of 30 thousand rubles is provided, and from eleventh to twenty-fifth - 15 thousand.  In addition, all participants in the qualifying round will receive memorable prizes - T-shirts with the logo of the championship.

      ‚Äú <i>Last year, for the first time in the Russian Code Cup, I officially entered the international audience.</i>  <i>Of the 4.5 thousand participants in the competition, more than a thousand were English-speaking: in the final round, residents of the CIS countries, Germany, Finland, Japan, Switzerland, China and South Korea fought for the champion title</i> , - says Olga Avgustan, head of the educational direction of Mail.Ru Group.  ‚Äú <i>The championship is held for the seventh time, and every year the competition is increasing, which means it is getting harder and more honorable to break through</i> ‚Äù. <br><br>  Tasks and technical part of the competition are provided by Mail.Ru Group experts and ITMO University experts.  More detailed rules read on <a href="http://www.russiancodecup.ru/ru/rules/">the championship website</a> . <br><br><h2>  Why participate in the championship? </h2><br>  Disputes about the utility of sports programming are ongoing.  On the one hand, when creating real projects, programmers work in teams and first of all they need to write code so that others can figure it out.  At the championships, however, we have to solve problems that are far from industrial use of programming languages, and this must be done very quickly, and such conditions do not contribute to writing code in good style.  On the other hand, for the sake of clarity of code, programmers often sacrifice its efficiency, which is an unaffordable luxury at championships.  The ability to find the optimal solution and squeeze the maximum out of each part of the program can be useful when creating highly loaded systems, where even minimal performance degradation in one module can lead to huge losses due to the fact that it will be used millions of times.  Regardless of which side to watch, sports programming is useful - it is quite difficult to argue. <br><br><h3>  Programmers </h3><br>  For most participants, championships are an opportunity to learn algorithms and train your brain to quickly produce a solution in stressful situations with limited time and resources.  Successful performance is an indicator of your own coolness.  Of course, a victory at the RCC can say a lot about a person‚Äôs level: most likely, he has a certain talent and solid experience behind him.  We are glad to see all the winners in the ranks of our company, but we are not satisfied with the active ‚Äúhunt for talent‚Äù, as well as the organizers of other similar championships.  The purpose of such events is the creation and strengthening of IT culture. <br><br><h3>  To students </h3><br>  For students who still have no work experience, championships like the Russian Code Cup are a great opportunity to get feedback on your code, understand what they are worth in comparison with others and determine the vector of further development.  Classes in sports programming, unfortunately, will not teach how to work in a team and write clear code, so this is hardly the best way to find a job.  However, a line in the resume describing success at such championships will show a keen interest in programming better than any words: such events are held on weekends, and since the student spends his free time participating in them, it means he really lives by it. <br><br><h2>  Registration for the championship </h2><br>  To participate in the championship you need to register on the site of the <a href="http://www.russiancodecup.ru/">Russian Code Cup</a> .  Competitions will be held online.  A preliminary round will start on March 19: participants will be able to familiarize themselves with the platform and evaluate their strength in solving one typical task.  Participation in this round is not necessary, and its results do not affect the outcome of the following.  Qualification rounds will be held April 2, 16 and 29. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/324006/">https://habr.com/ru/post/324006/</a></p>
