  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Beeline A100: extremely budget phone with surprisingly rich functionality</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In spite of the fact that in everyday life I use rather sophisticated smarts, I continue to experience unrelenting tenderness towards ‚Äújust phones‚Äù.  Firstly, because my parents (especially the father) prefer the simplest models, and therefore I try to be aware of the offers on the market.  Secondly, because in my heart I understand that it is just that simple, cheap and unpretentious normal mobile phones should be.  In order not to be sorry to be thrown into the bag, in order to drop it, without fear you could immediately fly into a tangible amount, and so that the battery served not for a day, but a week.  Or two.  And on a business trip or vacation such an unpretentious companion is simply necessary, because the local pickpockets are not asleep, and the expensive phone is guaranteed to cause them an influx of tender feelings.  And to remain in an unfamiliar place is not only without a favorite gadget, so also without all contacts and without communication ... The feeling, to put it mildly, is unpleasant. <br><br>  I have to ride quite a lot, and, having come to TAM, I shove the iPhone deeper into my inner pocket, and I use the Nokia N70, living in the household, it is terrible to remember how many years.  In principle, there are no special complaints against him, and after changing the battery a year and a half ago, he seemed to have gained a second wind.  But recently I began to scream in a strange way when receiving SMS on and off.  Strange?  Yes, not the word ... The service advised me not to suffer and buy something new, the benefit of the same functionality now is inexpensive.  And I thought that on trips, actually, I don‚Äôt need anything except voice, SMS and a capacious battery.  Therefore, I decided to look at very, very simple models.  Went to the familiar guys at Savelovsky market and saw their phone with the inscription "Beeline" on the back cover.  ‚ÄúWhat,‚Äù I ask, ‚ÄúThey started to rivet the Chinese instead of the‚Äú nokl ‚Äù?  And with MTS or Megaphone are there? ". <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/706/3b7/654/7063b76547ccf11da5ba4e398b2acf83.jpg" alt="Beeline A100"><a name="habracut"></a>

      ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù the guys answer, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs quite an official phone, Beeline branded some Chinese for themselves, it‚Äôs worth 850 rubles in stores.  You want, take 800.  Of course, I did not immediately buy anything, but I got the phone for weekly experiences.  And, having understood it better, I was pretty surprised. <br><br>  First, no it is, of course, not Beeline, but the most that neither is, ZTE.  The exact name of the model has not yet been able to calculate, because under the A100 code on the Internet there is some kind of old folding ZTE clamshell, and on the official website there is nothing like a belophone.  At the same time, ZTE is any better than complete namelessness. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c60/e30/08a/c60e3008afdab3f0c8de6db466428209.jpg" alt="Beeline A100"><br><br>  Secondly, the functionality of the beast (of course, given the price) is quite wide.  Vibrating alert, speakerphone, radio, favorite flashlight by many - all this is, and the radio works even without connecting a headset.  The latter is included and, unfortunately, is connected via a non-standard connector.  Unfortunately, because the sound in it leaves much to be desired, and if it is quite suitable for talking, it‚Äôs not very good for listening to music.  Meanwhile, the desire to listen to something vigorous may well arise, because Beeline A100 supports ... microSD up to 8 gigabytes.  Checked - really eats.  MP3 - theoretically - you can upload at any bitrate, but at 320 kbps / s the player no, no, yes, stumbles.  Therefore, it is better to limit to 256, the more so that on such ... ahem ... headset that 128, that 320 - you will not feel the difference. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1c6/493/fb0/1c6493fb059436a3a20121460dec8a61.jpg" alt="Beeline A100"><br><br>  Talking on the A100 is normal - and you hear everything, and you are heard.  It is almost impossible to miss an incoming call: first, it vibrates surprisingly strongly, and secondly, it screams VERY loudly.  Built-in ringtones - about twenty.  You can pick up pretty nice ones. <br><br>  Very pleased with the battery.  It seems that the capacity is small, 670 mAh, but in a week it was not possible to grope its ‚Äúbottom‚Äù.  I listened to the music, checked the games (I‚Äôll notice that there are only two of them and both are terribly primitive), tuned the radio, talked on the phone for an hour and a half, and only half managed to discharge the battery.  This, I note, after the first charge. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9a8/6dc/182/9a86dc182087622dcf03467dabacf509.jpg" alt="Beeline A100"><br>  I did not like two things.  The first is a very mediocre screen, a cheap CSTN matrix in all doubtful beauty.  Honestly, I would be more pleased with the black-and-white image than such a disgrace.  But, probably, there are not many such lovers of antiquity, and the Beeline brand colors look quite authentic on the matrix.  The screen resolution is not announced, but, by the eye, it is extremely low.  At least, for Internet surfing on GPRS, which the phone somehow supports, the screen is completely unsuitable.  Java, by the way, is not supported, so leave hope to put on it "ICQ".  I don't need it, but many, I know, love such little tricks. <br><br>  The second is a strange keyboard.  It is strange: it seems that the keys are not small, and are arranged as standard, but dialing the number and, especially, SMS is inconvenient.  Last, I note, it must be done very briskly, because the time after which the phone considers the letter chosen is extremely short.  You can adapt yourself.  But nevertheless it is felt that this is not Nokia and not even a ‚ÄúSonerik‚Äù. <br><br>  And the most important surprise phone in store for last.  The guys told me that he is locked to Beeline, and will not work with other SIMs.  I decided to check this statement and did not lose: there is no sim-lock there and there is no trace, hams all the sims with a bang.  And this is a completely different calico: it turns out that the device can be used in those parts where there is no ‚ÄúBeeline‚Äù yet.  For example, in Europe, in Turkey or Egypt. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a32/f76/5ae/a32f765ae09da98b6af1fd5e7fbc2d5e.jpg" alt="Beeline A100"><br>  Total  The very fact of having a Beeline logo on the lid did not inspire me to buy, because, despite all the sympathy for this operator, I have been using the services of another for many years :) But for my price, 850 rubles, and even cheaper, the offer is pleasant .  Moreover, there is also a SIM card with the ‚ÄúBeeline World‚Äù tariff, which is good for making long-distance calls and even for some international destinations.  Just don‚Äôt bite on the promised ‚Äú300 minutes and 300 SMS‚Äù as a gift.  They are allocated in portions of 3 minutes and 3 SMS per day, and if for some reason you did not immediately use this generous gift, it burns down the next day.  However, the gift horse ... <br><br>  I am still in the selection process, and if someone from the readers has already bought something like that, I will be grateful for the advice.  Just I ask you not to offer the grandmothers of Just 5: I'm not so cool to buy Chinese thirty-dollar fun for such money :) In fact, they are from the same berry field with Beeline A100, but the price tags, to put it mildly, are different. <br><br>  PS On the photo, the screen looks almost black and white, in life it is significantly more color.  And do not be surprised by the date: to be honest, it was just too lazy to exhibit it. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/97791/">https://habr.com/ru/post/97791/</a></p>
