  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Specialties, the study of which almost guarantees you a job in the United States in the future</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello friends.  Today, I would like to post an article translated from US College News and Rankings about which specialties will be promising for the next nn years in the United States and which are guaranteed to give you employment opportunities in the country - due to the fact that most specialties are on the STEM list . <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  1. Biomedical Engineering / Bioengineering. <br><br>  People working at the intersection of life science, engineering and medicine can be confident in a stable employment outlook, as well as enjoying all the pleasures of work.  The US Bureau of Labor Statistics gave 62% of the increase in student employment between 2010 and 2020, who study at Biomedical Engineering at American universities. <br><br>  2. Biometrics / Biometrics. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      This specialty teaches students how to build automated identification devices, such as face recognition systems.  The very scope of the biometric industry is expected to grow to $ 363 million by 2018, according to market research. <br><br>  3. Forensic Science / Forensics. <br><br>  Forensic students learn how to use technology to analyze evidence of crime.  As technology develops much faster than universities prepare graduates, the profession of a criminalist is becoming more and more needed. <br><br>  4. Computer Game Design. <br><br>  The global market for video and online games is expected to reach $ 82 billion by 2017, according to DFC Intelligence research.  To succeed, the student needs to learn animation, audio design, programming, and production management skills. <br><br>  5. Cybersecurity / Cyber ‚Äã‚ÄãSecurity. <br><br>  Large private and government companies have made protecting their computer systems a priority.  Between 2015 and 2017, the Pentagon plans to hire some 4,000 cyber security experts.  Students with a diploma in cyber security can also rely on a proposal from companies in the health, energy and life insurance companies. <br><br>  6. Data Science / Data processing and analysis. <br><br>  Science draws data from data in various fields, including mathematics and information technology.  Research company The International Data Corp., reports that the global volume of computer data doubles every two years.  Gartner Inc. estimates that this will help create about 4.4 million jobs worldwide by 2017. <br><br>  7. Business Analytics / Business Analytics. <br><br>  People working in the field of business analysts use data and statistical methods to study business performance.  The university curriculum also includes software, mathematics, statistics, and communication skills. <br><br>  8. Petroleum Engineering / Petroleum Engineering (technology of oil and gas production). <br><br>  10 years ago, no one believed in the extraction of shale gas, which is known to be deeper than ordinary gas. <br>  Today, the production of shale gas is one of the topical issues of our time, and you need a large number of professionals in this field. <br><br>  9. Public Health. <br><br>  There are two reasons for giving this specialty special perspectives: the threat of a global epidemic and that part of health care reform responsible for prevention among the population.  Students can focus on the scientific aspects of the discipline and find work in a hospital or a small commercial organization. <br><br>  10. Robotics / Robotics. <br><br>  Until 2020, in the field of robotics will be created from 2 to 3.5 million jobs, as shown by research company Metra Merch.  The specialty is partly interdisciplinary combining in itself some aspects of computer science, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, psychology and many other disciplines. <br><br>  On this, perhaps, all for today.  I hope that this article will help you in choosing a specialty.
