And in general, then all the way I had the feeling that something like this should be arranged for a small spaceship in the future. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/548/486/626/5484866264274edfba4cbcba585f092e.jpeg"><br>  <sup>Internal combustion engine.</sup>  <sup>Left and right outside the walls - tanks with solarium.</sup>  <sup>Total we carry a little more than 4.5 tons of fuel when consumed about 2.5 liters per hour.</sup> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3d5/8b9/cb8/3d58b9cb873e40dbbf0f41c385718be6.jpeg"><br>  <sup>Power control panel</sup>

      I'll tell you about a little engineering part and about life.  Not that this is just a hardcore IT topic, but I think you will be interested. <br>  Especially, about the possibility of <b>working remotely</b> online during such a trip. <br>  Caution traffic. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Port in Norway.  Norwegians are one of the most traveling nations in the world. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2c9/2d0/278/2c92d02788944204b62177a9e8550223.jpeg"><br><br>  But this is how the day our boat with a displacement of 55 tons.  Yes!  Immediately I say: I am never a specialist, so if something is wrong in the device of the vessel, please correct it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0a9/a45/067/0a9a45067b764acab5cb5d7d5b8f1b9d.jpeg"><br><br>  Almost in the geometric center of the vessel, just under the cabin, there is an internal combustion engine. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/349/b17/fb7/349b17fb7f9a4b489810f8b6e3d19e98.jpeg"><br><br>  There are many power-related subsystems near it.  For example, the box with the inscription I in the photo above is one of the batteries that will be needed at the moment when the yacht will be autonomous.  The engine starts up from these batteries.  They also scatter power to the rest of the ship‚Äôs systems ‚Äî light in the cabins, communications, a navigation computer, and so on.  The cabin company has a 220 V inverter, from which, among other things, USB connectors and standard power sockets, allowing you to charge cellular and laptops, stick out.  But you shouldn‚Äôt abuse the onboard power: as Slava Konteyner said, ‚ÄúWe start the engine, and he is the XPCP!  ‚ÄúBut your iPhone is charged.‚Äù  True, you can sail, but you will have to wag tacks for a long time against the wind. <br><br>  When the boat is in the marina (in the port on a special pier), food is taken from the "land".  At this time, the sockets in the cabins, the washing machine and so on come to life.  We have a special Russian incredibly long cable with different adapters: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6c8/5cc/103/6c85cc10393e49629cf8e8b914adca86.jpeg"><br><br>  Incredibly long - this is because the outlets on the marina are paid.  But they are paid on the day, and when the other yacht departs, the power remains.  You can walk 50 meters and find an empty slot with power.  At midnight, it will turn off, but until that time everyone will have time to charge their laptops, cellular, wash in a special small washing machine and shave the face muzzle.  Plus, the onboard batteries will be charged. <br><br>  In any case, the yacht also has a small generator on the stern. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/565/eb1/4b3/565eb14b36f04ba4877cb40511df1fa3.jpeg"><br><br>  <b>Cabin-company</b> .  There is a vandal-proof analogue clock with Moscow time, a first-aid kit, a hatch in the engine room and a welcome inverter (white box on the wall).  Also right here is a walkie-talkie and navigator table. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4b6/b37/cc5/4b6b37cc597245c8a4fbb60957d21121.jpeg"><br><br>  Here the captain keeps a journal (on paper), listens to local news, watches the weather and, most importantly, sets the course.  The navigator computer screen is pretty hand-made duplicated to the deck, where it can be seen from behind the wheel. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1dc/2d8/49b/1dc2d849b9b9463f81a9c5fcfefb6766.jpeg"><br><br>  Here it is.  Now pretty deep.  Deviation from the course is most likely caused by rolling. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ed2/8d5/0fd/ed28d50fd9344ba4b017705e5b458bad.jpeg"><br><br>  Under the wheel of the steering wheel - the output readings of speed, depth and current course.  The speed here is shown relative to water, so the true one should be looked at on the navigator screen by GPS - almost everywhere currents.  The depth is also better to watch both here and along the lot, because if the sensor catches the wrong reflection from the mud, you can run aground and wait for the tide. <br><br>  The yacht can autopilot and well kept course.  Control in the sea is usually done with buttons "plus or minus degrees" on the figovine from the bottom of the steering wheel.  In the port and when maneuvering - already rotating the wheel. <br><br>  Above there is an antenna for a satellite phone that works with the Iridium grouping.  These are low satellites that allow you to easily communicate even low-power devices.  Iridium is most often needed for weather requests.  The captain picks up the phone of the ‚Äúcity‚Äù phone near the navigational table and calls the office in St. Petersburg.  He asks for the weather and hangs up.  The office can also call and say something.  For a month, it can take 15-30 thousand to communicate.  Theoretically, a normal dialup modem can be screwed to it, but this is already an incredible perversion. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4cd/b5d/ef2/4cdb5def26734194b7d2cacacf6537a1.jpeg"><br><br>  There is also an emergency cocoon on the deck (which is like a rescue capsule), an emergency communications radio attached to the scotch tape, various small tools plus a tuzik - an inflatable boat for disembarking.  When the coast is not suitable, the yacht anchors, and the "tuzik" is used as a shuttle. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/00c/8ef/8cb/00c8ef8cb623485e97b409101d3ebb94.jpeg"><br><br>  Here is a walkie-talkie, in it live the spirits of the Norse  The ‚ÄúAlphaLimaTangoEchoRomeo EchoGolfOcean‚Äù label on top is a mnemonic way to explain to the English-speaking world our name. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4c4/fac/d96/4c4facd965c647d0a647ae9dc526cbf3.jpeg"><br><br>  Yes, the part with rivets is a hatch on the deck.  It opens and closes like a desk drawer.  Want to go out - imagine you're in the mailbox.  Captain Dan had a habit of closing the door even in hot weather ‚Äî he was used to cold arctic expeditions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/248/a07/dcf/248a07dcfc3e4256ac59fff6216403ec.jpeg"><br><br>  On the other side of the hatch, there are still sensors, analog, they are already on deck, they can also be seen from the wheel of the steering wheel: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2cb/d10/ee3/2cbd10ee339e4f3585d30bcdace27df3.jpeg"><br><br>  Now let's look at how to live here at all. <br><br>  Here is the <b>caboose</b> .  The plate on a hinge and with a heavy plumb bobs in the opposite direction of the yacht, so a kettle or pan on it is always calm.  Works from gas cylinders, which are connected nearby.  Garbage is accumulated in bags and dumped in boxes on the shore. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3e5/949/567/3e59495673864544bd3baa327cb38010.jpeg"><br><br>  All dishes should be fixed to the stove with such ears: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/431/082/3a2/4310823a23ff476e93b5261e8474ec64.jpeg"><br><br>  Cabins look like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ff5/715/fbd/ff5715fbdbb545e9aabbf72b5e7da301.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c37/349/441/c373494414f3434182826297291e3a9b.jpeg"><br><br>  Because of the fish they seem huge, but in practice - almost like a compartment on a train. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/78b/e49/a6a/78be49a6a5ae4fa5aa9cb35ef8e9fd90.jpeg"><br><br>  This is the sailor's friend - the latrine.  Some in the early days of waiting fraternal arms with him.  To make the correct feeding of ichthyander, you should use a pump on the side - first, to pump off what you have done, then pour water over. <br><br>  60 powerful strokes - and now not a trace.  Nobody really wanted to work with pumping, so we found, for example, the nearest hostel on the beach and went there.  Taking into account that in Norway the doors are not locked even at night, those who wished could also study the contents of their refrigerator and take pictures in the interior. <br><br>  Clean water on a yacht 1400 liters in a special bunker.  Dishes in avtonomka wash seawater (pump at the sink), then rinsed drinking.  In Norway, water can be drawn from the tap and immediately drunk, but the previous bunkering was in Ladoga, then in St. Petersburg, so we boiled water for reliability.  A shower takes water from the same tank.  If there is an external power, the shower is warm, because the boiler. <br><br>  Everything is stored in closed cabinets or under raised floor: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/744/6ed/5bb/7446ed5bb86e4029b21554372f634d40.jpeg"><br><br>  More precisely, for me it is a raised floor, but there is some special name.  See the rivets in the corner of the wood tiles?  These are not rivets, these are handles - turned, pulled out, pulled for it, opened without a ‚Äúfrog‚Äù. <br><br>  All that is, should be fixed in case of pitching.  Here are the cups: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c50/910/901/c509109017e84c3fbc3db3626f26be11.jpeg"><br><br>  Accordingly, many cabinets, small spaces for products, tools and so on.  Finding the right product from the habit becomes quite a challenge.  For example, a step into the galley, under which water and vegetables are stored.  About the same hidden refrigerator. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d7c/cb3/aa2/d7ccb3aa253241bba6d8fefc45e1ae2e.jpeg"><br><br>  And then there is the attraction ‚Äúcatch the camera‚Äù when the captain decides to set sail - and the neighbor without the proper level of paranoia just left him on his bed. <br><br><h4>  Is it possible to work? </h4><br>  In general, yes, but difficult.  No Internet at sea.  With rare exceptions.  The first is the marina.  It happens that there are no outlets, no water, no Wi-Fi.  And it happens - that all at once, even on the smallest island.  By the way, cities on the islands with a population of 750 people have full-fledged LTE stations and a double power ring - from a local energy center on gas, for example, and an emergency diesel at the other end of the city.  Here the young man catches Wi-Fi on the marina: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f98/852/795/f98852795ae1439882a85a5f7e5e6c47.jpeg"><br><br>  If the marina does not have its own network, it is possible that Wi-Fi is distributed by local restaurants or hotels.  Once we even met in the middle of the city a pillar, near which an open net was caught. <br><br>  An ordinary city on the island is surrounded by mountains or the sea from all sides.  Therefore, operators find a position somewhere higher, so as to cover the entire city with a sector, and set up a common site.  See the ZSSS?  Near the sector of cellular operators in the city: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bbf/5f9/831/bbf5f9831b58428b8f96c5f49bc3e5cd.jpeg"><br><br>  Here is another position, here a place was found on a nearby small island, and they placed narrow antennas, rather than the usual wide sectors: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/511/793/ed3/511793ed3e2a495f8eccd2bd5396ff06.jpeg"><br><br>  And another one: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/226/11f/686/22611f68661c4824acb9888057d4de49.jpeg"><br><br>  In several places come across conditionally closed wai-fai who ask to check in at the port in order to gain access.  Everywhere there is a small link "continue without check."  But the biggest surprise was this ferry: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f44/27c/fe5/f4427cfe5f28421986c9ff78c16ab266.jpeg"><br><br>  For someone he is a transport, and for us - a hotspot.  Such a ferry and more ships (noticeably more) distribute the network to passengers, and the network is fast - 5 Mbit / s with a lag of about 1 second (after all, a geostationary satellite).  You find the ferry on the horizon, you come closer, you expose the Norwegians for half a gig, and you go further. <br><br>  The local cellular Telenor costs 12.5 crowns per megabyte (about 60 rubles).  But at the same time, by default, only 1 megabyte can be consumed per day - the unlimited at 256 kb / s is activated further.  When connected, they give a 200-megabyte package for 3 days (if they exceed, they also cut the speed).  There are 15-gigabyte packages, but we could not figure out how to connect.  As well as to replenish the balance without the help of local. <br><br>  Everything.  And if you are thinking now whether to sail or not, I will say - go.  It is beautiful. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/82d/ce7/7d1/82dce77d117547c18bf9f086c90f8c0b.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/18b/113/0ff/18b1130ff12d4638a52f647eb86b5ea5.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ba3/db9/66a/ba3db966ade242139cc15a2d3a7bf1dd.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8db/756/f3b/8db756f3bf6645f5b84bf51c5ba6eff3.jpeg"><br><br>  Yes.  But the crew of Muscovites, which we met on one of the major islands.  They have a small rental yacht.  Well, tell me that it is not Firefly.  Even the faces are almost the same: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f4c/e68/0ad/f4ce680adfbd477fb87ea9de14e66e8c.jpeg"><br><br>  This, by the way, is the middle of the night.  Just here is the polar day. <br><br>  In the sea, by the way, a lot of IT people.  Saw the guy in the Ubuntu hoody, plus here's the beautiful name of the ship: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6ec/631/365/6ec63136584e40799e3e5dd4be9cccdf.jpeg"><br><br>  In general, it is great if you are not afraid to remain without the Internet for a whole day or two. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/232193/">https://habr.com/ru/post/232193/</a></p>
