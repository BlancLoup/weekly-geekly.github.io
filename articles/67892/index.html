The service will live!</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The whole last year did not write anything about Reformal, although it can be said that there is a reason.  We have grown up and are already doing quite a grown-up business, not looking back at the numerous ‚Äúdachyotututneto.‚Äù  Promoting their sites and kicking others know what I'm talking about. <br><br> <a href="http://www.reformal.ru/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/be2/f45/2c7/be2f452c7010097ffc150887d1886c2f.gif" align="left" alt="reformal.ru"></a>  Reformal.ru is a feedback service that allows you to understand why someone left your project, unsubscribed from the mailing list and, moreover, stole a good half of users.  You can read about the project in detail in my <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/startup/29161/">first topic</a> . <br><br>  Over the past year, from an idea that did not let sleep at night, Reformal has grown into a completely independent commercial product, not only bringing a sense of duty performed to youth, but also a certain profit.

      In the light of recent achievements, I can‚Äôt resist not to take stock (read: boast) and not share statistics with the curious (read: boast a lot). <br><br>  So. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>Reformal: Let‚Äôs Blow On the Holy</b> <br><br>  Personally, to me, as a person who was once infected with startups, it was always curious to look at the statistics of other projects.  And how is it there?  Alexa Rank or TOP100 - here they are, and then - who will let me go ?!  For Reformal.ru make a correction. <br><br><img src="http://www.useridea.com/files/images/interes.jpg" alt="useridea" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right"><br>  Today, more than 5,000 users come to the site per day, the number of registered exceeded 13,000. There are already 10,000 projects created, the widget is shown more than 12,000,000 times a day.  The service works only on one, but very powerful and well-configured server.  There used to be two of them: one for the web, the other for returning statistics.  But somehow they sat down in the evening, they thought, and one decided to "kill." <br><br>  Reformal traffic is calculated in terabytes. <br><br>  On the site, I do not hang advertising from the principle.  Well, perhaps, one banner 240x400 or, when this place is not occupied - adsense advertising.  The project is already fully paid off, and even remains to be developed.  But, as they say, bread and butter is bread and butter, but nobody canceled black caviar with a yacht!  So, there is something to strive for. <br><br>  What is especially pleasing in the project: in the language of news, this is ‚Äúlack of investment‚Äù.  Not a dime of other people's money was spent on the development and promotion of the project.  So, on a dark night they won't ask me, you can sleep well.  Two hours were spent on promotion of Reformal.ru: during this time I wrote the first post on Habr√©.  And that's it! <br><br>  <b>Do you want to fly?</b>  <b>Work your wings!</b> <br><br>  Work to improve the service did not stop even for a minute from the very day that we announced it.  The biggest pride was the release of the second version of the site, in which we took into account your numerous wishes.  Thank you all!  Also we brought something from ourselves: you didn‚Äôt ask, but then we don‚Äôt doze either! <br><br>  There is a lot of new, so I will go through only the most interesting features: <br><ul><li>  now you can place a reform project on your domain; </li><li>  You can leave ideas and make comments right in the widget without leaving the site; </li><li>  several ideas can now be combined into one; </li><li>  pre-and post-moderation of ideas and messages; </li><li>  You can ban unwanted by name or IP; </li><li>  and, for sweetness, our pride: now you can customize the look of the project and the widget to the style of your site and observe the changes in real time.  Very comfortably. </li></ul><br><img src="http://pic.ipicture.ru/uploads/090825/m6ZoUSIsfM.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>About missile defense</b> <br><br>  We have included almost all the additional functions in the PRO package, whose services (unlike the free basic functionality) are provided for money.  We decided to support domestic owners and reduced prices from $ 18 to $ 7 per month, or to $ 45 per year.  We will, as they say, take the amount.  It is possible, and this price will seem outrageous to someone - we are always ready to listen to your wishes. <br>  For all projects there is an opportunity to connect the PRO-package of services for 5 days free of charge. <br><br>  <b>Hit!</b>  <b>Another blow!</b>  <b>By</b> <br><br>  Of course, it didn‚Äôt do without attempts to understand ‚ÄúWho is who‚Äù.  Three DDOS attacks were organized on the server, which, however, did not lead to anything: our administrators in two hours cut down the backup server and set up anti-dos filters.  We will not poke a finger, but the attacks exactly coincided with the appearance of a similar project on the network.  We have no evidence, so we will not plant holivar and stigmatize anyone.  As a matter of fact, the appearance of competitors only makes us happy: it means that we worked for nothing: we didn‚Äôt eat up, we didn‚Äôt get enough sleep - our ideas still resonate in the harsh hearts of hot startups. <br><br>  <b>Farther?</b>  <b>More!</b> <br><br> <a href="http://www.useridea.com/"><img src="http://useridea.useridea.com/files/images/logo_white-useridea.gif" alt="useridea" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left"></a> <br>  Having developed the project well in more or less familiar Russian, we thought about expanding the audience.  The first steps towards multilingual support have already been taken.  Our project on <a href="http://useridea.com/">UserIdea.com</a> (English version) is already working.  Soon wait for the appearance of sites in Italian, Spanish, German, Belarusian and Chinese. <br><br>  If it is interesting, I can post here the statistics on the work of UserIdea.com, especially since the indicators reflecting the pace of development of the project in the States will be much higher than in Russia. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/67892/">https://habr.com/ru/post/67892/</a></p>
