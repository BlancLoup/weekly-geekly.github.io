Now it was reported that the duties will be charged to Russian buyers at the time of purchase, the authorized operator of payment processing - "Mail of Russia". <br><br>  The limit on duty-free purchases is currently around 1,000 euros, since the beginning of 2019 it has halved to 500 euros.  Regarding the procedure for collecting fees for purchases of Russians in foreign online stores, Deputy Finance Minister Ilya Trunin said this during an e-commerce conference "E-commerce 2018". <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Now, according to Trunin, the technology of instant payment of duty by the buyer is already being tested.  ‚ÄúWe have already begun to conduct an experiment together with the Post of Russia, which will make it possible to pay this payment, if it occurs, at the time of the purchase.  As soon as this technology is worked out, we hope that this will happen within the reasonable time frame required for such a technology on such a large volume of operations, we will be ready to announce how and when we lower the threshold for duty-free entry, ‚ÄùTASS <a href="https://tass.ru/ekonomika/5661815">reports</a> .

      As for the Post of Russia, its representatives announced the conclusion of the necessary agreements with a number of Internet sites.  The head of the state-owned company, Nikolai Podguzov, stated that the corresponding interfaces have already been developed, and the experiment is in the final stage.  At the same time, fees will be charged "not at the time of arrival of the parcel at some sorting center or customs clearance zone, but directly when buying on the Internet site." <br><br>  It is worth noting that the launch of payment of fees through the "Post of Russia" according to the plan will start from November 1, 2018.  In this project, the state-owned company acts as an authorized operator who makes customs payments for individuals.  The authorized operator, as stated by the Ministry of Finance earlier, <a href="http://www.cnews.ru/news/top/2018-10-11_rossiyane_budut_platit_poshliny_za_pokupki_v_zarubezhnyh">has the right</a> to collect and transfer customs payments for individuals in favor of the FCS. <br><br>  The mechanism of payment of duties with the help of an authorized operator was developed by the Ministry of Finance and the Federal Customs Service in connection with a reduction in the size of the duty-free purchase limit.  By the way, from 2020 this limit will be about 200 euros.  The reduction is made in accordance with the rules of the customs code of the countries of the Eurasian Economic Union, which entered into force in early 2018. Previously, the issue of changing the existing duties was discussed repeatedly, causing dissatisfaction with Internet users and representatives of e-commerce. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThere can be different options to discuss, their [FCS] option can also be considered, but you can not get to it until 2020.‚Äù  It should be understood that while reducing the cost standards for importation, what impact this will have on the load of people, the load of information systems - whether they are ready or not.  If this happens smoothly, then we can talk about a further decline.  If we see any problems, then, naturally, the information system will be set up first, we need to train people, increase the number of people, ‚Äù <a href="https://habr.com/post/414461/">said</a> Alexei Sazanov, head of the customs and tax policy department of the Ministry of Finance in June. <br><br>  In addition, since 2010, customs rules are in effect in Russia, according to which the duty is charged to the recipient of foreign parcels, in the event that the goods cost more than 1 thousand euros or their weight exceeds 31 kg.  This is the norm developed for one person per month.  Fees are charged as 30% for exceeding the norm by weight or price) of at least 4 euros per 1 kg).  Earlier, the Ministry of Finance offered several options for reducing the duty-free entry threshold. <br><br>  It should be noted that one of the most "light" versions of duty-free import of goods is currently working in Russia.  Thus, a citizen of the country can buy goods in the foreign stores for the sum of 1000 euros per month - and pay nothing for the duties.  This is not bad, because in other countries, including Belgium, the Czech Republic, Finland, Slovakia, Germany, Belarus, Austria, Hungary, Italy and other countries, the limit is only 22 euros per month (or for one package).  At the same time, in countries such as Sweden, France and Brazil there is no threshold for duty-free entry. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/426395/">https://habr.com/ru/post/426395/</a></p>
