Adapted for the street, so what? ‚ÄùIt was for those who want to get the answer to this question as accurately as possible and with the facts, we prepared a review. <br><br>  One of the fashionable trends today is to make a camera with all possible ‚Äútricks‚Äù: 4K resolution, observation in the thermal range, analytics on board.  Thus, the product goes into a high-level price range.

      Manufacturers add features and increase prices due to high competition.  The cameras that we will present in the review today are created according to a different philosophy: they have a relatively low price tag, and the characteristics are ‚Äúsharpened‚Äù to solve specific business problems. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Cloud Surveillance Features </h2><br>  Nobelic models are adapted to work with the cloud-based video surveillance service Ivideon.  Using them, you can remotely control the security of any objects.  The service is suitable for both private and business users, for whom it is important to ensure the convenience of using video surveillance systems consisting of several cameras on one local, several remote or even hundreds of objects.  On business tariffs, you can store entries in the cloud archive for up to 365 days (in special cases and more). <br><br>  In old CCTV systems, all ‚Äúvideo analytics‚Äù ends with motion detection, while Ivideon already provides <a href="https://ru.ivideon.com/face-recognition/">face recognition</a> and <a href="https://ru.ivideon.com/blog/detektor-ocheredej-ivideon/">queue</a> <a href="https://ru.ivideon.com/face-recognition/">detection</a> modules. <br><br>  Using the built-in activity detector, the user promptly receives notifications on any device when the situation on the object changes.  And in order to minimize false alarms, it is enough to select the detection zone on the frame section. <br><br>  Additionally, the service has the ability to organize public video broadcasts.  In just a minute, you can set up a live video broadcast or provide access to videos all over the world.  The burden of ensuring the quality of the video stream will be borne by our servers. <br><br>  The service supports online viewing of broadcasts and archives from any platforms (Win, Linux, MacOS, Android, iOS);  There are free applications for mobile devices, a client on a PC and a personal web account on the Ivideon website. <br><br><h2>  Five stages of testing </h2><br>  We work with two leading manufacturing plants in the world.  We usually agree that we are shown a roadmap for a year, so that we can plan the development of firmware for specific cameras in advance. <br><br>  There are always interesting and promising models in the roadmap.  We highlight the actual ones for ourselves and wait for the first samples to come to our office.  Next, the testing process consists of five stages: <br><br><ol><li>  The first input testing includes analysis for image quality, sound, motion detection, etc.  We draw attention to the quality of the material of the case, fasteners and other components.  Based on the test results, we take it further into development, refuse or send it for revision. </li><li>  If everything suits us, we take the model into development.  At this stage, a second test takes place.  Our developers look at the software ‚Äúinternals‚Äù of the camera firmware, find bugs, errors and even vulnerabilities.  We are seeking to address all of these shortcomings. </li><li>  Before the release of the firmware, a third test is carried out.  If everything is in order, then release it in release. </li><li>  When the first batch samples arrive at the Ivideon office, they are also tested for compliance with previously established parameters. </li><li>  Finally, when a batch of cameras arrives at the warehouse, they arrive and undergo the last random testing. </li></ol><br>  In addition, we undertake warranty obligations (2-5 years) and replace the problem equipment with new one completely free of charge. <br><br><h2>  Nobelic outdoor cameras </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/uo/k6/zv/uok6zvyihmi0wz_oqkfypiaa0x0.jpeg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Photo <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ds_technology/">Source</a></i> <br><br>  Now we offer several Nobelic outdoor cameras in a cylindrical plastic case (bullet form factor) - these are the <a href="https://ru.ivideon.com/shop/product/nobelic-nblc-3130f-wsd/">Nobelic NBLC-3130F-WSD</a> (1.3MP) models with Wi-Fi, the <a href="https://ru.ivideon.com/shop/product/ip-kamera-videonablyudeniya-nblc-3430f/">Nobelic NBLC-3430F</a> (4MP) with PoE and a number of others. <br><br>  Some models are available only on request - for example, Nobelic NBLC-3330F-WSD, which the TechnoRating portal <a href="https://tehno-rating.ru/968-luchshie-kamery-videonablyudeniya-2019-goda.html">called</a> the best professional camera of 2019 among street cameras of various vendors. <br><br>  The cost of cameras in the lineup starts at 6,200 rubles.  Technically, they differ in several ways: connection (Wi-Fi or POE), resolution, viewing angle, support for SD cards.  Otherwise, we are talking about very similar devices. <br><br><h2>  Design </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/-q/xq/kj/-qxqkjfigs0dworifptdxzomdlo.jpeg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Antenna only on model 3130F-WSD with Wi-Fi.</i>  <i>Photo <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ds_technology/">Source</a></i> <br><br>  In order to avoid spurious illumination of the protective glass and the lens, as well as rain falling on it, a protective visor is installed on top.  The cameras can operate in a wide temperature range (from -30 to + 50 ¬∞ C).  And the IP67 case protects the device from moisture and dust. <br><br>  We note an important point for business buyers: the Smart IR integrated adaptive IR illumination has an effective range of 30 meters. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Smart IR on / off</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7f7/fd4/adc/7f7fd4adc7baa7ce28c317741f59bd40.png" alt="image"><br></div></div><br>  And given the protection against dust and moisture, you can use models not only on the street and in the ‚Äúgreenhouse‚Äù office environment, but also in unheated storage rooms or in production. <br><br>  For example, we used Nobelic to deploy a video surveillance system at a fish processing plant located on the island of Shikotan.  Due to the stormy winds and the generally unique weather for the project, we chose the 3130F-WSD model with Wi-Fi paired with tp-link access points.  Using a video surveillance system with wireless video transmission, we avoided problems with torn wires and communication wiring. <br><br><h2>  Take a look inside </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/-s/wj/xq/-swjxqclimtoldmqkrpf4oxfrae.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  The basis of the device is a highly sensitive CMOS matrix that forms a picture with a maximum resolution of up to 2688x1520 pixels (in the older model). <br><br>  You can not only transfer the image from the camera to any local server or to the cloud archive, but, if necessary, write it to the MicroSD card by installing it in the corresponding camera. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/hy/ng/rt/hyngrtsyxtneyxc2s2l62erxpdq.jpeg" alt="image"><br>  <i>The Nobelic NBLC-3130F-WSD supports memory cards up to 128 gigabytes</i> <br><br>  The cameras have a web-based interface through which you can watch live and archived recordings, as well as a separate settings tab for recording on a NAS  ‚Äã‚Äãwith this function you can, if necessary, back up recordings to your NAS-server. <br><br>  To protect video information while working with our cloud surveillance service, data encryption (TLS) is used at the entire stage: from the camera and in the cloud. <br><br>  <i>To obtain the highest quality video, a whole range of technologies that improve the image is used.</i> <br><br>  In particular, to combat backlight there is a backlight compensation function (BLC).  It provides high-quality and detailed images even at high brightness of the oncoming light source. <br><br>  To achieve a clear picture even in low light, 3D-NR noise reduction technology helps.  It is able to effectively deal with interference and noise of various origins in the image. <br><br>  The correct and accurate color rendering system provides automatic white balance (AWB). <br><br>  A significant contribution to image formation is also made by the automatic gain control (AGC) function.  It is she who will not allow the camera to ‚Äúgo blind‚Äù with the sudden inclusion of bright light in a guarded room. <br><br>  Another feature is the integrated dynamic range expansion (WDR) technology. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">How WDR works</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3ae/12b/a10/3ae12ba1003aad2f6e806b4fcf475025.gif" alt="image"><br></div></div><br>  By activating it, you will receive equally high-quality video in both light and dark parts of the frame.  Thanks to this, you can use the camera at the entrances to underground parking lots, at the entrances to warehouses, restaurants, shopping and business centers. <br><br>  Of course, an observant reader will certainly ask about the presence of a built-in microphone and speaker.  In these models, they are not provided, because the camera is intended primarily for street use. <br><br>  The package includes all the necessary accessories for installation and installation.  Watch the video about unpacking the camera. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4Mnzh2fqpOw" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><h2>  Camera operation </h2><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CboggPiu9LU" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  (At the end of each video, nighttime mode is shown.) <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/17dJyahWmW4" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  The camera did its job perfectly regardless of the level of lighting and the presence of backlight.  AWB technology provides realistic and accurate color reproduction.  Even the smallest details are worked out and perfectly distinguishable. <br><br>  Another significant advantage can be considered a large depth of field.  Even objects located more than 15 meters away are clearly distinguishable and easily recognizable.  In this case, there is no loss of detail and image clarity. <br><br><h2>  Support </h2><br>  Regardless of which Ivideon service plan you choose, whether paid or free, you can always ask for help with round-the-clock technical support.  And by the way, she is multilingual. <br><br>  We also note that in the event of a malfunction of the equipment purchased from us, we ensure its quick replacement, and you do not have to wait 45 days, as is customary with some companies. <br><br>  Nobelic outdoor cameras are available for order <a href="https://ru.ivideon.com/shop/category/cameras_bullet/">on the Ivideon website</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/461069/">https://habr.com/ru/post/461069/</a></p>
