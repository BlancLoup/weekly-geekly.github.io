In 2011, there were 2 streams and 150 participants, in 2012 - 5 streams and 300 participants, in 2013 - 500 IT specialists, not only from Ekaterinburg.  And we are not resting on our laurels.

      March 14, 2014 we will meet for the fourth time.  Join now! <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Our plans for this year: 700 participants, 6 parallel streams and about 70 speeches from Russian and foreign speakers. <br><br>  Reports will go in seven sections: <br>  ‚Ä¢ Front-end <br>  ‚Ä¢ Serverside <br>  ‚Ä¢ Interface development <br>  ‚Ä¢ Development Management <br>  ‚Ä¢ Analytics <br>  ‚Ä¢ Testing <br>  ‚Ä¢ Rocket science (at the interface of industrial programming and research) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a9e/6a9/9c7/a9e6a99c7328e6b8e4c4d9e82548ae5c.jpg" alt="image"><h5>  Everyone will have something to discuss on the sidelines </h5><br><br>  Probably, all organizers have their own criteria for success. <br><br>  We will understand that DUMP-2014 was a success if its participants: <br>  - find out what is happening in the field of software development in the Ural companies; <br>  - get acquainted with the global trends; <br>  - the reports will be more interesting than on the sidelines (although this is a mega complex task); <br>  - everyone will leave with at least one idea that they want to implement on Monday. <br><br>  By the way, we are moving from the cozy and familiar ‚ÄúAngelo‚Äù to the new venue - Ekaterinburg EXPO.  There is a lot of space there, and we just have a lot of great ideas about what can be arranged in the breaks: from racing on segways to battles of robots.  There is where to roam :) <br><br>  Now we are forming a program, because this is the most important. <br><br>  Armin Ronacher, Artyom Polikarpov, Anton Nemtsev, Roman Dvornov, Vadim Patsev, Alexander Gornik, Dmitry Kotkin have already confirmed their participation. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/317/cb6/38f/317cb638fd434bba78c1492a3dd451fb.jpg" alt="image"><h5>  Speaker Evgeny Varavva, Google (Dublin), DUMP-2013 </h5><br><br>  Reception reports are in full swing, you can speak!  If you have something to tell your colleagues, you can apply for a report <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Y1s6OplKL3aYCXvfMEN3u6rmOQR-e2RhvqPPlYL0s9s/viewform">here</a> .  Or write to elena@it-people.ru with the note ‚Äúwe want to report‚Äù the title and description of the report.  In the letter, tell us a little about yourself and how your report will be useful to the audience.  Our program committee will select the most useful reports that will be included in the conference program. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ccb/c34/06f/ccbc3406f3e4d1da7c25d90d330bbedc.jpg" alt="image"><h5>  Listeners of one of the sections DUMP-2013 </h5><br><br>  Know that if you have something to say on the following topics - you are the speaker of our dreams, we want you! <br><br>  Serverside <br>  ‚Ä¢ DevOps - what kind of animal and what they eat, tools and practices <br>  ‚Ä¢ Message queues <br>  ‚Ä¢ SQL vs NoSQL <br><br>  Front-end <br>  ‚Ä¢ Web components <br>  ‚Ä¢ SPA development <br>  ‚Ä¢ New CSS3 corners <br>  ‚Ä¢ Browsers and speed <br>  ‚Ä¢ Node.js <br><br>  Interface design and engineering <br>  ‚Ä¢ Statistics has become the main tool for determining development plans, choosing new features <br>  ‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúFlat design‚Äù (for or against - no difference). <br><br>  Development Management <br>  ‚Ä¢ Problems of small distributed teams <br>  ‚Ä¢ How to schedule dates in a team that develops several products at once. <br>  ‚Ä¢ How not only to plan, but also to meet the deadline <br>  ‚Ä¢ A happy and motivated team - what is behind it? <br><br>  Testing <br>  ‚Ä¢ Effective testing without a tester - organizational and technical ways. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Continuous integration system as a project rhythm and communication method <br>  ‚Ä¢ How to deal with bug driven development <br><br>  Analytics <br>  ‚Ä¢ Requirements Management and Tracing Techniques <br>  ‚Ä¢ Reuse requirements <br>  ‚Ä¢ Agile at work analyst <br>  ‚Ä¢ Tasks of analysts in implementation projects <br>  ‚Ä¢ How to minimize the effects of analyst errors? <br>  ‚Ä¢ GOSTs and notations - are they needed? <br><br>  Rocket science <br>  ‚Ä¢ Large graphs and their visualization <br>  ‚Ä¢ Big Data <br>  ‚Ä¢ Natural language processing <br>  ‚Ä¢ Pattern recognition <br>  ‚Ä¢ Recommended systems <br>  ‚Ä¢ Auctions <br><br>  By the way, if there are topics that you are personally interested in, write in the comments?  And we will try to find answers to your hot questions. <br><br>  There is another opportunity to participate in a big business - to become a partner or sponsor of the conference.  We love to come up with creative promotions for friends companies that help solve specific promotion goals (promotion of the hr-brand, promotion of the technology to the IT audience and others).  Details <a href="http://dump-it.ru/sponsors/">here</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/555/0c2/a69/5550c2a69620525aff319f5a7fd7ab1d.jpg" alt="image"><h5>  Campaign with the cats of one of the sponsors of DUMP-2013 </h5><br><br>  And most importantly - just come.  It will be useful and fun.  We will be very happy to see you. <br>  Here you can buy a ticket. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/210800/">https://habr.com/ru/post/210800/</a></p>
