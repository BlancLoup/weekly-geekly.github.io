  <section class="page js-page"><h1>About the issue of standardizing the W3C specifications</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Today I would like to raise the topic of web standards again, but in a slightly different way.  I believe that it is time for all supporters of the canons of the W3C to move from defense to offensive. <br><br>  Someone will ask what is he talking about?  Is he going to ban something?  No, I do not want anything to be banned, I want the obligations of software developers for the Web to consumers to appear. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So, we all know the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), an organization that develops and implements technological standards for the Internet, which today, unfortunately, have the status of recommendations.  It is precisely because of this status that the developer of the leading product in the market of product browsers refers to its ‚Äúsloppy‚Äù development.  Not the last role in the current state of affairs was played by the fact that Internet Explorer had won over Netscape Navigator, which allowed Microsoft to virtually monopolize the market.  And I don't blame her for that.  These are market relations and the company was able to win from its direct competitor, for which she respects me. <br><br>  What do we have today due to the IE victory over NN?  If at the end of the 90s most of the people came to the Web, who, nevertheless, had little to do with IT, who could make an informed choice of software, today only the lazy haven't gotten to the web.  To do this, even it is not necessary to have a computer.  Therefore, it is not uncommon when communicating with the customer to the question of which browser your company uses, you can see the eyes of ‚Äúfive compiles‚Äù asking you not to use foul language.  =) For a modern schoolboy user Vasya or Natasha's secretary in a certain company, the very concept of the Internet is inextricably linked to Internet Explorer, even if they do not know this name.  And this very Internet Explorer, in most cases IE6, is hopelessly outdated and frightening in its understanding of the W3C recommendations.  Even the release of IE7 did not correct the situation properly.

      I have nothing against the position of Microsoft regarding the delivery of the IE browser bundled with the operating system, but I am extremely negative about its quality. <br><br>  Just recently, the Norwegian company Opera, the developer of the competitor Internet Explorer of the same name, openly spoke out against the blue giant Redmond, issuing a press release in which it reports that a complaint was filed to the European Commission against Microsoft.  Opera developers want to force Microsoft to stop using its dominant position on the desktop PC market to impose Internet Explorer and force it to follow web standards. <br><br>  The essence of the requirements of the company Opera comes down to two main points: <br><ul><li>  Microsoft should stop supplying the operating system with Internet Explorer and / or include pre-installed versions of alternative developers' browsers.  This, according to Opera, will provide users with a real choice. </li><li>  When developing a browser, Microsoft must follow current industry standards.  There was an unpleasant situation when site creators are guided by non-existing standards, and how their site will look in browsers with a large market share, other browsers are ignored. </li></ul><br><br>  I am of the opinion that it would be unprecedentedly difficult for Microsoft to remove IE from the delivery with the Windows operating system, as was the case with Media Player.  IE components have penetrated deep into the OS and are used by many of its applications.  The situation when alternative browsers are supplied with Windows seems to me utopia. <br><br>  But the second paragraph of the requirements of the Norwegian developers seems to me quite a doable task on one condition.  W3C specifications should be recognized as an international industry standard.  In this case, none of the developers of web browsers, and not just Microsoft, will have the right to launch a product that violates accepted standards. <br><br>  A web developer, in particular, clientside developers, this will make it easier to breathe a sigh and spend more time not on fitting high-quality code for low-quality browsers, but on perfecting your code.  Everyone and the developers and developers will win. <br><br>  The following main incorrectly implemented W3C specification specifications bring the biggest headache for clientside developers: <br><ul><li>  Xhtml </li><li>  CSS </li><li>  Dom </li></ul><br><br>  In addition, HTML has long become a standard and despite the fact that its implementation in all current browsers does not cause complaints, so it should also be included in this list. <br>  So, my proposal comes down to the publication of a petition requesting that the W3C specification be given the status of an industrial standard. <br><br>  So. <br><ol><li>  <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/">HTML 4.01</a> Current status ‚Äî W3C recommendation of December 24, 1999. </li><li>  <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/">XHTML 1.0</a> Current Status ‚Äî W3C recommendation dated January 26, 2000. </li><li>  <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/">CSS2.1</a> Current status - candidate for recommendation dated July 19, 2007.  It should be noted here that the company to collect signatures in support of the petition will take at least six months or a year, by which time this specification is most likely to receive recommendation status. </li><li>  <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-DOM-Level-3-Core-20040407/">DOM Level 3 Core</a> Current status ‚Äî W3C recommendation of April 7, 2004. </li></ol><br><br>  With a positive outcome of such a campaign, browser developers will have to improve their product before they reach a high level in order to be able to get a certificate of conformity and launch their product on the market. <br><br>  Currently, there are no application certification programs for compliance with the standards developed, however, I think that if the campaign is successful, this problem will be solved. <br><br>  After a detailed discussion of the problem and the findings, I and my <a href="http://lovata.com/">company</a> will decide whether to write a petition and create a website to support it. <br><br>  Related Links: <br><ol><li>  <a href="http://internetno.net/2007/12/13/opera-files-antitrust-complaint/">Windows without IE - the impossible is possible?</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://dimox.name/opera-files-antitrust-complaint-against-microsoft/">Opera filed an antitrust complaint against Microsoft</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://forum.myopera.net/showflat.php%3FNumber%3D36926">Opera vs IE: Microsoft is responsible</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.opera.com/pressreleases/en/2007/12/13/">Ur choice of standards ‚Äî compliant web browsers</a> </li></ol><br><br>  Crosspost from <a href="http://webdev.lovata.com/2007/12/15/o-voprose-standartizacii-specifikacij-w3c/">webdev.lovata.com</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/17542/">https://habr.com/ru/post/17542/</a></p>
