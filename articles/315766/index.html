It was based on the Transact-SQL query language, created jointly by Microsoft and Sybase.  The strategy for the further development of Microsoft SQL Server took on a solid and complete look in 2010.  Then it was announced that SQL Server would be a single product implemented in desktop systems, data centers and in the cloud (in 32-bit and 64-bit versions). <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/427/978/e14/427978e14fc45e662f3a2659341d13c4.jpg"></div><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Priority areas include business intelligence (BI) and the development of appropriate tools, the development of a cloud computing ecosystem with the transfer of business intelligence tools to the cloud, and the enhancement of the capabilities of SQL Server Management Studio with SQL Azure.

This is not a radical ‚Äúmilestone‚Äù, but experts call Microsoft SQL Server 2016 the most significant update in the entire history of the product.  It includes advanced analytics tools, machine learning, as well as new opportunities for analyzing and visualizing information on any devices. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a1b/617/89e/a1b61789e60054b4c7b3a580b9fd502c.png"></div><br>  <i><font color="#999999">The new version of Microsoft SQL Server allows you to create mission-critical transaction processing (OLTP) applications with improved scalability, in-memory performance and high availability.</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">This ensures consistency of the local and cloud environments: SQL Server allows clients to access data on local servers and in the cloud.</font></i> <br><br>  Here are some key features of Microsoft SQL Server 2016: <br><br><ul><li>  <b>The new technology of permanent encryption</b> (Always Encrypted) protects data during storage and movement without sacrificing database performance.  Security is especially important when transferring data to the cloud, and constant encryption is designed to solve this problem. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a9c/c60/892/a9cc608921acf732c0e118d9d0dd43c5.png" width="300"></div><br></li><li>  <b><a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/303346/">Stretch Database</a> technology</b> allows you to dynamically transfer ‚Äúhot‚Äù and ‚Äúcold‚Äù data from SQL Server to the Azure cloud.  What is it for?  In particular, as historical data is accumulated in the database, its complexity and cost of operation increase.  Automatic transfer of archived data to the cloud as they become obsolete is a reasonable solution.  Such data is moved in the background.  This does not affect applications and requests. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5d3/360/6fa/5d33606faa00ecf519390725e84f9a99.png" width="300"></div><br></li><li>  <b>The <a href="https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/cansql/2016/11/16/sql-server-2016-row-level-security/">Row Level Security</a> (RLS)</b> feature allows administrators to control and control user access to certain data.

Along with SQL Server, its arsenal also includes the Azure SQL Database (‚ÄúDBMS as a service‚Äù) and two cloud-based no SQL solutions ‚Äî Azure DocumentDB and Azure Tables.  In 2016, Microsoft made another important announcement - introduced SQL Server for Linux.  Its data management and business intelligence platform has become even more versatile, expanding the possibilities for working with data and applications using different tools, languages ‚Äã‚Äãand systems in a cloud, hybrid or local environment.  This is another step towards simplifying SQL Server and increasing its availability.  The release of this version is expected in mid-2017. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#3AC1EF">Meet SQL Server for Linux</font> </h2><br>  <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/ru-ru/server-cloud/sql-server-on-linux.aspx">SQL Server for Linux</a> , based on SQL Server 2016, provides the ability to develop and deploy intelligent applications on a single platform for data management and business intelligence.  Microsoft‚Äôs announced support for the Linux family of operating systems in the new version of SQL Server is the corporation‚Äôs next step in entering the Linux market after a partnership agreement with RedHat and Canonical. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/298/252/c14/298252c144e31dd2e7f2ec5da61370e8.png"></div><br>  <i><font color="#999999">With the release of SQL Server for Linux, developers will have a wide choice of platform for applications, and virtual server users ( <a href="https://ruvds.com/">VPS</a> ) will be able to deploy SQL Server not only under Windows.</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">SQL Server applications can be run in Docker containers.</font></i> <br><br>  In particular, some customers are already using Azure Data Lake services on Ubuntu.  Now developers can create new applications with all the features of SQL Server.  And collaboration with Red Hat means migrating SQL Server to the Red Hat Enterprise platform: customers will get more advanced OS selection options.  The site SQL Server also has information about the new features of the database. <br><br>  In March 2016, a preliminary trial version of SQL Server for Linux was released, containing the basic functions of a relational database management system.  As expected, the Linux version of SQL Server will have the performance level required for mission-critical tasks, a low TCO (Total Cost of Ownership), a high level of security and support for hybrid cloud technologies, including as Stretch Database. <br>  Microsoft approached the adoption of open source in 2008, when the corporation joined the Apache Software Foundation.  In 2009, she made one of the largest contributions to the development of Linux through code that provides virtualization based on the Hyper-V hypervisor. <br>  Since 2014, Microsoft has become even more active in supporting the open source software community.  The code of the .Net platform, C # and Visual Basic compilers, Edge browser and some other products has been fully or partially open.  Microsoft became a platinum member of the Linux Foundation along with Fujitsu, HP, Cisco, Huawei, IBM, Intel, Samsung, NEC, Qualcomm and Oracle.  Today, she participates in many Open Source projects run by the Linux Foundation, including CII, node.js Foundation, OpenAPI, and OpenDaylight. <br><br>  Therefore, support for the Linux kernel did not come as a surprise to the industry.  Microsoft has not only demonstrated once again that it plays an important role in the open source movement.  The release of SQL Server for Linux is aimed at expanding the market: the corporation does not want to lose the 15% of the global DBMS market, which is occupied by Oracle-products of Oracle and IBM.  According to IDC, Microsoft owns more than half of the global market for DBMS for Windows.  However, on other platforms, Oracle leads, with its share approaching 50%. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/516/e5c/4c8/516e5c4c85ac575216988917c4127175.png"></div><br>  <i><font color="#999999">According to analysts, the Microsoft solution can be chosen not only because of its attractive price, but also because it contains a number of built-in features that are not available in competing products or are offered for an additional fee, and are compatible with Microsoft Excel</font></i> . <br><br>  Microsoft announced that customers will be able to purchase licenses for SQL Server free of charge, provided that they decide to abandon the Oracle DBMS.  ‚ÄúStop depending on Oracle.  Transfer your Oracle databases to SQL Server and get the appropriate temporary SQL Server licenses for free with Software Assurance, ‚Äùurges Microsoft on its website.  The corporation even developed an online training: "Transforming Business by Moving from Oracle to SQL Server." <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/89a/2c3/52a/89a2c352a319fa1bacb743617fdd872c.png" width="300"></div><br>  Canonical has already made SQL Server for Linux available in Ubuntu OS images that users install in Microsoft Azure.  This allows them to flexibly use computing resources and inexpensive disk storage.  This option dramatically reduces the overall cost of the platform.  In addition, in cloud environments, resources are optimized for increased workloads.  Using Docker and Canonical orchestration tools, you can flexibly increase performance in accordance with the load.  Azure and container technologies in the Linux environment allow you to implement complex and high-loaded projects without buying additional equipment. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6af/8ae/c44/6af8aec44dc111cc18f082651d76a89e.png"></div><br>  <i><font color="#999999"><a href="https://visualstudiomagazine.com/Blogs/Data-Driver/2015/04/database-survey.aspx">According to a survey of</a> database administrators, Microsoft SQL Server is already used in most organizations.</font></i> <br><br>  The release of SQL Server for Linux means that Microsoft is becoming a provider of cross-platform solutions.  Earlier, Microsoft has already moved its Office and Office 365 to iOS and Android platforms.  Products like Microsoft Intune and Azure AD also support multiple devices. <br><br>  The Microsoft project, codenamed Helsinki, involves migrating SQL Server to several Linux distributions, including Ubuntu, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server.  This logically complements the corporate cloud strategy - IaaS VM support in Microsoft Azure for various Linux distributions (CentOS, openSUSE, Oracle Linux, SUSE Linux Enterprise Server, Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Ubuntu).  When purchasing SQL Server licenses (per server or processor core), the customer will be able to use the same license in Windows Server and Linux.  Under the Software Assurance program, you can receive future product versions for free. <br><br>  A competitive analysis of the RDBMS market over the past 30 years shows strong growth in Microsoft SQL Server, especially after the release of SQL Server 2000. With Linux support, this growth could be even greater.  Currently, Linux, software virtualization, containerization, orchestration, application and communication environments with open source play an important role in the public cloud.  In addition, according to IDC, almost 40% of x86 servers are sold with Linux OS and a third of them are used as database servers.  Of course, Microsoft SQL Server will not become an open source product, but by offering it as a component of the Open Source stack, Microsoft will significantly increase the number of installations.  This is a serious challenge for Oracle and IBM DB2 - also a proprietary database for open source environments. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#3AC1EF">What will it be?</font> </h2><br>  The next version of SQL Server, codenamed SQL Server v.Next, will provide the Linux ecosystem with Microsoft DBMS, including SQL Server Agent, Active Directory authentication, high availability and disaster recovery, data security and protection.  A preliminary version of SQL Server for Linux is already available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES), Ubuntu, as well as cloud and container platforms such as OpenStack, Docker Swarm, Kubernetes, and Mesosphere D / C OS. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ace/b69/671/aceb696717ab3aecf0209e160ad4c9c5.png"></div><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Meet: <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-vnext-including-Linux">SQL Server for Linux</a> .</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">All major SQL Server 2016 assets will be included.</font></i> <br><br>  SQL Server for Linux also includes SQL Server 2016 tools such as storing columns in memory, which improves performance when running queries up to 10 times, In-Memory OLTP, which increases the speed compared to storing tables on a disk up to 2.5 times.  And Row-Level Security and Dynamic Data Masking protect data on the server from unauthorized access without making changes to client applications. <br><br>  When installing SQL Server 2016, standard Linux methods are used: yum for Fedora distributions and apt-get for Debian.  It supports systemd launch, Linux file paths in T-SQL statements and scripts.  High-availability clusters can be managed using popular Linux tools like Pacemaker and Corosync. <br><br>  Microsoft also offers cross-platform tools for SQL Server on Linux or Windows, such as SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS), SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT), PowerShell (sqlps), and the recently announced Visual Studio Code Extension for SQL Server.  Microsoft Migration Assistant tools for transferring workloads are also supported.  Using cross-platform tools, organizations can now start migrating to SQL Server for Linux, and in 2017 switch to the commercial version of v.Next. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/533/c63/285/533c6328549ec7aa27f09c76a63733f6.png"></div><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Continuous integration and delivery (CI / CD) - DevOps practice, which accelerates the introduction of corrections and changes, allows you to release products to the market, to improve their quality and reliability.</font></i> <br><br>  With support for containers in Windows and Linux, SQL Server will run Docker Swarm, Red Hat Open Shift, Mesosphere DC / OS and Kubernetes orchestrators.  With Management Pack for SQL Server for Linux, organizations can use System Center Operations Manager for comprehensive monitoring ‚Äî from hardware to database instances. <br><br>  Since SQL Server is now available for containers, you can use some DevOps practices in application development, for example, creating an image of a container for use in different operating systems.  Using Docker Swarm or Red Hat Open Shift orchestrators, you can quickly update containers in test and production environments. <br><br>  With the release of SQL Server for Linux, you can use databases in a heterogeneous environment ‚Äî both on your own servers and in virtual machines in private / public clouds and <a href="https://ruvds.com/ru-rub/licence/ms_sql_server">with VPS / VDS service providers</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/315766/">https://habr.com/ru/post/315766/</a></p>
