Recently, several new delicious dishes have been released, but ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/cb7/36e/a8f/cb736ea8f4b9b62ee4337562e3926638.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  ... but each cook has to have his own "fad".  I think that with Cowon they can boldly have a new <b>D2 +</b> - a dish familiar to everyone, but with a new taste.  A little tasting traffic. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I warn you right away - the number of metaphors to be unaccustomed to can be really bad)))

      So, <b>Cowon D2 +</b> is an even hotter dish, stuffed with a lot of delicious ingredients, including a long time, a touch screen, memory card support, great sound and a lot of software features.  Accordingly, the purpose of the review is to make sure it is good and learn in more detail what it is prepared from) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ab2/026/d6d/ab2026d6d19b4578687d83be875c94ed.png" alt="image"><br><br>  In fact, he is the elder brother of the well-proven <b>Cowon D2</b> player, however, the differences between them are minimal.  In addition to minor external changes, the older brother acquired the ‚Äúsound of a new generation‚Äù in the person of the <b>BBE +</b> improver, as well as a flash player and all sorts of small utilities. <br><br><h2>  Ingredients </h2><br>  Despite the fact that the player is almost half the size of the <b>Cowon S9</b> player ( <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/hardware/72322/">review</a> ), the box is almost twice as large :) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4ae/5fc/f0a/4ae5fcf0a99ab3a482db35e48af4a9df.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Inside it was: <br><br>  - Player Cowon D2 +; <br>  - Regular headphones; <br>  - "Stylus"; <br>  - Wire to connect to PC; <br>  - Quick Installation Guide; <br>  - A huge variety of any papers; <br>  - Disk with software. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/508/659/c5b/508659c5ba5e367e9f64217140e623cd.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Papers = warranty card, some kind of cartons for downloading 35 free songs, audio books, etc.  - in general, everything that everyone always leaves in the box) <br>  On the disk there are USB drivers (for Windows 98), a COWON MediaCenter combine (aka JetAudio) and a manual manual. <br>  The stylus itself is not needed (if you really press it, you can use the stylus from the PDA) - the player interface is adapted for use with your fingers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e68/b85/a73/e68b85a7319d9b8260bbbc3af5e0338a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  But if you insert it into a special slot of the player on the side, an inconspicuous pointer turns into a kind of stand, and at two angles (50 or 75 degrees).  Well, very original. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/12c/fdf/4c0/12cfdf4c077e5cbbcff94f26381bc4e6.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Quick Guide black and white, already in 14 languages ‚Äã‚Äã(including the most powerful).  A more complete and color version of it is on the disk - there is a description of all the settings and nuances.  So with the docks full order. <br>  Regular headphones as elsewhere ... such regular) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c42/967/558/c42967558b3ebe584bcea5a3df1aeea2.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  Studying </h2><br>  The dimensions of the device are quite small - 78x55x16mm (with a weight of 95 grams) - I did not find a better object for comparison than two matchboxes lying side by side.  Well, or okay, a little shortened and very swollen credit card.  The design is dominated by right angles and sharp edges - a kind of brick.  The weight for such modest sizes is very large, but when you take the player in your hand, you can feel all its pleasant weight, seriousness and solidity. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c01/46f/68b/c0146f68b49a073b5083048df5be04dd.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  On the "credit card" is a 2.5-inch screen (LCD TFT, QVGA - 320x240, 16 million colors), framed by a silver frame made of matte plastic (there are rumors that there is still a black version of the case).  The back side of the same color, with a pair of inscriptions for recognition. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4a9/8cc/6f4/4a98cc6f428167e4b90aefacb2009d2c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The ends on all sides are black and slightly protrude above the body - they contain all the functional elements. <br>  Below is a slot for memory cards (SD / SDHC / MMC), on the right - a small slot for the stylus. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/270/e68/81c/270e6881cd4a6be4bdc8f937badab9ed.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  On the left, there is a headphone jack and a small plug, behind which miniUSB and EXT ports are hidden, as well as the ‚Äúpoint‚Äù of the Reset.  Everything is signed and carefully closed, without backlash. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/73e/f5e/9af/73ef5e9af60338b24a51e51692afd55d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  On the upper side there is a two-position power switch (to the left - to switch on the device or display, to the right - to lock), a hole in the built-in microphone and three player control buttons (volume control and exit to the menu).  The latter are made neatly and conscientiously, but with their thumbs blindly they will not be very comfortable to press - it would be better if they were at least somehow divided.  In addition to the standard functions, you can assign other functions in the settings. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/668/4f6/886/6684f68861d351ef03662050c1586582.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  There are no more functional elements. <br>  The screen is very bright - so much so that in the dark around it is visible a light "aura"), but fortunately, you can turn it down.  With flowers, too, everything is not bad ... but still, comparing with AMOLED, these are two big differences.  On closer examination, a small screen grain is visible (like on a PDA, for example), but everything is from afar approx.  Sensory properties are good - you can poke a finger or a stylus, it does not matter.  Accidentally in my pocket, nothing has ever been pressed - apparently due to the fact that the screen is slightly sunk into the case. <br><br>  The EXT connector can be used to charge from an external adapter (manul says it will take about 3 hours), which is not included.  Therefore, we charge only via USB (about 5.5 hours) - which is also a good option.  The manual states that charging via USB hub will not work - but in reality everything is OK, provided that the hub is active :) <br>  Also, this connector can be used to display the image on TV, if you buy an additional cable, well, and to record from the line input (through another player or through an external microphone).  Doubtful benefits of bonuses for everyday use, but still) <br><br>  I did not have a large flash drive to check, but the forums say that the external 32GB player is easily supported.  I took two 4GB cards with me and changed them a couple of times depending on my mood. <br><br>  They write in Yandex, saying that you can't flip through songs in your pocket, that the stylus is attached to a thread and it is embarrassing that it does not read tags and file names does not see that it hangs a hundred times a day ... it's all nonsense.  At least on firmware 2.11, there were no such artifacts with file names and freezes at any stage of use (fill up to 99%, listen, delete, change cards).  And the ‚Äúfor pocket‚Äù keys, as I said, can be overridden in the settings, but this is really not the best way out (but this is still the way out). <br><br><h2>  Menu </h2><br>  Until fully operational, the player turns on in 3 seconds, turns off three times faster. <br>  After switching on, a screen appears in front of the user with 8 color icons, above which time, volume level and battery charge are shown. <br>  The menu items are <b>Music</b> , <b>Video</b> , <b>Image</b> , <b>Text</b> , <b>FM Radio</b> , <b>Recording</b> , <b>Utilities,</b> and <b>Settings</b> .  Yes, that's right - something in English, something shortened (why not write ‚ÄúPictures‚Äù instead of ‚ÄúPicture‚Äù? After all, this is shorter than ‚ÄúSettings‚Äù).  Looking ahead, there are often similar cuts in the player, which in my opinion, are somewhat ugly.  However, you can figure it out. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/672/b12/fcd/672b12fcd40cc0fc5cce0478d137c821.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Music</b> - it would be strange if this item was not in the first place in the music player) The player starts up - we see an album picture in front of us at the top left (or a picture of a disc if the carpet is not registered in tags) - it‚Äôs a pity that it cannot be increased. <br>  Track information is written to the left of the carpet ‚Äî artist, song title and album.  Under this all - three icons that inform about the playback mode (in a circle or to the end), the method of selecting a song (in order or separately) and the place from which the song is played (all songs or DPL). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f76/26a/ce7/f7626ace7fd8d953f97ee26644b0788c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  By the way, DPL (Dynamic Play List) is a list in which you can add no more than 256 arbitrary songs (similar to the heart icon in S9), thereby forming a list of the very-most.  In addition to this method of selecting a loved one, there are bookmarks - they allow you to add a song to a separate list (bookmarks), which will start playing from the moment it was bookmarked.  Useful stuff. <br><br>  Under these elements there is a progress bar with the time of the song (past and complete).  Even lower is the bitrate and 6 blocks showing the equalizer settings. <br><br>  Pressing anywhere on the screen causes additional buttons in the middle - ‚Äútrack backward‚Äù (or scrolling), ‚Äúpause / play‚Äù and ‚Äútrack forward‚Äù.  4 more buttons are located below.  Two of them are stupid - one removes these buttons from the screen (Close), the second displays the main menu (similar to the hardware button M on the top of the player).  The other two are more interesting - the first allows you to select the desired song in the file manager, add to bookmarks or to DPL, and also start playing the same from them. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/dd5/66b/a96/dd566ba9651e1c6fb478f2177af4ffac.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The second one changes the playback modes (there is a loss of 1 song, folder or all content, as well as the AB segment) and changes the equalizer settings. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/cb3/424/ab3/cb3424ab3b9b24820119e8c142d20ef8.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Equalizer presets are complete, each can change a lot of settings.  Improvers include level changes (from 0 to 10) BBE, Mack3Bass, 3D Surround Stereo Enhance and MP Enhance. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c26/12b/7a0/c2612b7a01baaf00260c20f5b7556e90.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  It is also possible to change the playback speed.  In general, the equalizer is very functional and lovers will definitely like it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6eb/80b/514/6eb80b5147364f96bcaca92c57aaa0a1.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The file manager is simple as a universe - we select the place from which we will play (player or memory card), we select the folder and track.  Navigation - gestures or buttons on the right side.  Everything is ok, except that the scrolling is not very pleasant - to squander a couple of positions, you need to act with careful movements. <br><br>  With the video, in principle, all the same, it does not make sense to consider separately.  I consider most of the rest of the functions to be a nice addition to the music, because they will be given minimum attention. <br><br>  <b>Images</b> - view images (JPG, BMP), filled in memory.  Slideshow (with speed setting), zoom, turn clockwise or counterclockwise.  Any picture can be set as a background pattern. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/279/db8/e21/279db8e21c0102f2374d9d24416e672c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/82a/0a0/3d8/82a0a03d877ac55c629393f142d2f826.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Text</b> - reading filled text files (no more than 2mb).  You can change the size of the text. <br><br>  <b>FM radio</b> .  Again, only FM is available from 87.50 to 108 MHz.  Headphones act as an antenna.  Avtoskan found 24 stations, which immediately fell into memory (it is a pity that they can not be assigned names).  From any station you can record a signal (32-256kbit).  I almost don‚Äôt use radio, so it seems to me that it is implemented at a quite tolerable level.  I liked the stylization of numbers in the range;) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/fe2/a91/c3f/fe2a91c3f9700fa52bbfc02f5e26fc66.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Record</b> .  The player can be a voice recorder - recording is done through the built-in microphone (its hole is on the upper side) or through a plug-in microphone (must be purchased separately) or through a line input.  You can adjust the recording volume and its quality.  IMHO, the function is not superfluous. <br><br>  <b>Utilities</b> .  I always hated this word) Initially 4 applications are available - a flash player (I have not tried it, but I dare to suggest it is the same player as in Cowon S9, which allows you to run games and applications in SWF format), two calculators (simple and scientific; the second can be a good helper for a student or student) and a notepad is a program where you can write or sketch something with a stylus (or with a finger, but clumsily).  To choose from a notebook several colors and 5 levels of thickness "pen".  Maybe someone will come in handy. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/763/469/db9/763469db938b9c9bee528a44dbc83462.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d77/bea/367/d77bea367b53b8819acc5529145af87b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Settings</b> .  In the settings there are also 8 icons - JetEffect, display, timer, general, recording, FM-radio, system and information.  It does not make sense to list everything - if you are interested, <a href="http://besho.narod.ru/Upload/CowonD2plusRussian.pdf">download the</a> manual and look for the right one or ask me) I will just note that you can reconfigure the hardware buttons a little - now I have to hold the ‚Äúmenu‚Äù button to switch the track.  Those.  you can still use it in your pocket, but not as comfortable as with the S9. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/864/72d/15a/86472d15abf1ffaf67b502b96e065598.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b33/dec/2ee/b33dec2eeacb560941c89dadbd80c36e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/625/d69/e2b/625d69e2b27a2f7e99a20d56a2ee4390.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  A separate point worth noting is the speed of the shell - there are no delays and, in general, everything is hearty.  And still - the player is supported in all family of Windows, and in MacOS and * nix-ah it is available only for file transfer. <br><br><h2>  Tasting </h2><br>  I think a few words first need to be told about the dining tools with which food was consumed - this is the <b><a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/hardware/67534/">Razer Moray +</a></b> and the completely new <b><a href="http://www.audio-technica.ru/cat/port/CK/CK_115.html">Audio Technica CKS70</a></b> .  And if about the first I wrote a detailed review, then about the second is still too lazy) even if they definitely deserve attention. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a5b/265/d60/a5b265d60f6a5a55b2750982f8c003cf.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  First of all, they are unusual in their form, which, apparently, is dictated by the structure of the ear canal.  Two-level ear cushions allow you to sit down in the ear so qualitatively that the earbuds do not fly out with impacts from which regular headphones often fly out.  Thanks to the second level, the earpiece can not be shoved too deep, and the level to which they are inserted is very comfortable.  Everyone to whom I gave them to try on, spoke positively about the convenience of landing.  What is important - thanks to all the same forms, the headphones can not be mixed up in places in the dark - they just do not fit wrong.  Sound insulation is very good. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/45b/dfa/b1e/45bdfab1eb16b877991777014f3d09e4.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The silicone wire quietly endured several pinches of lightning, and the L-shaped connector has been reluctant to break for a month now :) However, I like the straight plug more. <br><br>  Those who heard and listened to Cowon D2, in the paragraph about the sound quality will understand me.  The player has 50 volume levels available - at the maximum some tracks, IMHO, it‚Äôs just dangerous to listen.  But personally, I just love this "dits-dits".  It is not the first time I‚Äôm writing about musical devices, but so far I haven‚Äôt learned how to test-describe them somehow more or less seriously, so everything is again purely subjective and with epithets that are already boring :) And one more thing - neither jazz nor classics , I don‚Äôt listen to rock (for sooooo rare exceptions) - for the most part only electronic music, incl.  music and songs created on the computer.  I like listening to music and lyrics much more than fleetingly listening to the "listening" of instruments in the musical material.  So ... dear audiophiles ...) do not judge strictly. <br><br>  As mentioned above, the sound is very loud (without any wheezing, hissing, hissing), but in different headphones and environments, as well as with different tracks and formats, it will be perceived differently.  But always and everywhere music (in the same CKS70) interrupts external stimuli - whether it be an approaching subway train, music in a club or something else - only vibrations are felt) <br><br>  All the available MP3-shki ate perfectly - no problems with the file names and tags arose.  Available OGGs also went easy, as did WAVs, WMA and FLAC.  The only thing I have not tried is the APE files, but I think there should be no problems with them either.  Nevertheless (throw stones in my garden - they will come in handy), I still remain a supporter of ordinary MP3-NIS with a good bitrate (in it at least it is easier to find the right one). <br><br>  My favorite drum and bass sounded more assertive and became even more beloved, but I also drove another music for comparison.  For example, everything is fine with the introduction (from 7 to 26 seconds) of the song ‚ÄúRum‚Äù from the last album ‚ÄúKing and the Jester‚Äù - very many ears (or players) make a terrible mess out of this introduction.  Immediately everything is super.  As with ‚ÄúPendulum - Slam‚Äù at 1:17 (as well as ‚ÄúThrough the loop‚Äù after 01:20), with the original ‚ÄúStompbox‚Äù from ‚ÄúThe Qemists‚Äù after 00:25, 00:40 and 01:00 (and in The perfect high track after 01:05).  From the ‚ÄúG-77 - Fans‚Äù, right at the very beginning, a chill flashes across his cheeks, which spills over his back and then gives up somewhere in his legs) I can add another point to the five for his three-hour ‚ÄúPositimix‚Äù) But there was such I began to hear unpleasant artifacts that I had not previously paid attention to - ‚Äúwhite noise‚Äù at the beginning of the songs, for example (and what to do if not all the songs are available in good quality). <br>  In general, the sound is really at a very good, high level.  Exactly what manufacturers should offer their customers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/48d/d33/db1/48dd33db115d3c83972adeded0f946af.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  I also have not tried it yet, but the people installed <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockbox">Rockbox</a> , an alternative firmware that allows us to give the player a second wind with many new functions and formats of perception.  In addition to Rokbox, there is a whole <a href="http://cowonworld.ru/forum/index.php">community</a> in which enthusiasts make themes, games, applications and other goodies - it makes sense for happy owners to delve if they have not already done so) <br><br>  Everything is not so smooth with the video - you can not watch demo videos on the player, because  It would be stupid on the part of the manufacturer to put files with which something is wrong), although by their colorful content one can appreciate the possibilities of the screen.  Therefore, for the test, I uploaded a handful of bitty files to the memory card (not yet examining the player specifications). <br>  So, what is seen in the file manager is not always played.  Only AVI-shki with a resolution of 320x240 were launched, another resolution was not wanted to be played.  If you choose some unsupported format - the player thinks for a second ... and starts to play the first file on the list, which will be in his teeth. <br><br>  No FLV, MPEG, and even more so mkv (I just foresee the question ‚Äúhow is it with HD video viewing?‚Äù Which is set in each of my review of devices endowed with a screen - right down to the e-book).  A pity it would be great to upload videos from YouTube without spending time converting. <br><br>  A small result - the player is not so designed for movies (the same S9 had no problems with non-converted video), although if not too lazy to fiddle with converters every time, it will do.  Here, by the way, is a nice <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/soft/73944/">bonus</a> regarding converting - it may come in handy to many;) <br><br>  A few words about the photos - photos of 7mb in size (from the camera - I had to use a card from the player for the camera a couple of times) are opened as follows - at first the jipeg with a bunch of squares is drawn and after 5-7 seconds it becomes suitable for viewing.  Accordingly, small pictures look much faster.  Logical, right?  ) <br><br>  Work time will delight music lovers.  After a full charge at the very start, with the player I have been running for the second week (several hours of music on the road) and while the screen glows 50% of the charge.  Well, yes, I will not lie - sometimes the player has time to hitch a little from the USB port, when I throw a couple of tracks on it) The manufacturer promises 50+ hours.  But, by the way, the speed of work arrived: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1ce/19e/429/1ce19e429b11fee6fb7d08824f60fabc.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3f9/81c/796/3f981c7966be49c32cbb58a3a329e382.png" alt="image"><br><br>  This is slightly faster than the Cowon S9. <br><br>  From memory I don‚Äôt even remember heavier drugs - ipods, current creatives and valkmans ... let's say, a few fall short.  Although the appearance and all sorts of bonuses they are really very tasty. <br><br><h2>  JetAudio </h2><br>  If, in the case of the Cowon S9, I did not dare to install this software package (because I once put it on a long time and I remembered well all its bulkiness), then I decided not to refuse and see what changed there. <br><br>  Bulkiness has not disappeared anywhere (by the way, the same Winamp will soon grow up and it will be possible to fully organize races of combines and tower cranes), but there are also very nice features.  For example, a compact view (in one line) is why I use the last Winamp (with the Bento skin), because it is extremely convenient and practical.  Immediately, it is more sophisticated and has a lot of excess on it, but everything that is necessary on it is also very usable. <br>  The second thing you liked was the work with file libraries.  Fast scanning and sorting, the ability to set estimates for compositions.  Yes, yes, all this is a lot where there is, but for example, I haven‚Äôt met the opportunity to indicate the ‚Äúmood‚Äù to the tracks) flash drives) and JetAudio allows this to crank.  Well, the third - the friendliness with the player.  The same Winamp even found the external device, but the files issued by the list were one big heap.  And JA not only found it, but also laid it all on the shelves, made it possible to check the firmware update, make backup or upload your logo. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/dd6/475/30e/dd647530e9cf4fd857dfe717d78b2616.png" alt="image"><br>  <i>( <a href="">clickable</a> )</i> <br><br>  Of course, this program has supporters and opponents ... but for me personally there are no weighty advantages.  Do not use this monster for the sake of a couple of raisins, which you will use once a week, if not less? <br><br><h2>  Poking around </h2><br>  <u>Yummy</u> <br>  - Small size; <br>  - Large and bright, color and touch screen; <br>  - The possibility of expanding the amount of memory with SD cards (and at the same time being a card reader); <br>  - A lot of non-core raisins - video, flash, pictures, texts and other calculators notebooks; <br>  - The sound produced is one of the best I've heard so far; <br>  - Battery life voooz takoooy; <br>  - Ability to install Rockbox. <br>  - Price. <br><br>  <u>It's not tasty</u> <br>  - A bag in the package could sweeten the dish; <br>  - Minimally inconvenient navigation (or unusual ... after Cowon S9); <br>  - Without hardware buttons it is sometimes very difficult to control (rebind - not that); <br>  - The three hardware keys (which I just mentioned) are very close to each other; <br>  - I did not want to play non-converted videos; <br>  - The player did not switch automatically to winter time :) <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The price in different menus may differ slightly, but in general it is very specific and depends on the configuration - from </font></font><a href=""><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">5000</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> (for the version with 4 GB of internal memory) to </font></font><a href=""><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">7500</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> (with 16 </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">GB </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">on board). </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Well, very very tasty)</font></font><br><br><h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Count us </font></font></h2><br> <i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">... one, two, three ... gentlemen, there are three of you!</font></font></i>  <i>:)</i> <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">To say that this is a fundamentally new recipe, perhaps, it is impossible - something like that (Cowon D2) has already been tried by many and, judging by the books of reviews, the majority liked it. So, in terms of new features, there are not so many things here, for the sake of which, for example, you can change D2 to D2 +. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">On the other hand, for those who have flaunted all this time without a player or with a software solution on the phone, this model can be a valuable discovery. Recently, someone clearly noticed " </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Respect and respect for the bear that came Bumburum in the ear</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> " which is partly true), but in this case it‚Äôs impossible not to pay attention to the difference - the sound is such that a deaf person can hear a rumor) and worked out (of course, when replacing regular ears with more miraculous ears).</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">So if you are ready to endure a player in which there is no 5-inch screen and non-core knick-knacks are just a nice addition to ‚Äúsharpening a good sound‚Äù - feel free to add to the list of candidates. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I am sure, like a cockroach in cataclysms, he will survive many there;) A </font></font><br><br> <a href="http://twitter.com/Boomburum"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">waste of time</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> )</font></font><br>  <b>Successes and good mood!</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/74093/">https://habr.com/ru/post/74093/</a></p>
