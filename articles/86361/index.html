  <section class="page js-page"><h1>About wonderful 3G</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Most recently, the Siberian branch of Megafon <a href="http://sibir.megafon.ru/news/1224291">first announced that it had become a Kuzbass brand,</a> i.e.  everyone is happy, everything is fun, the standards of service are high, the brand is known and respected.  Days earlier, the company announced the launch of a third-generation network in the Kemerovo region and invited people to offices to test third-generation services: video calls, high-speed Internet.  They really say, if you hurry, you make people laugh. <br>  How are things going in reality? <a name="habracut"></a><br>  It should be said that the network has earned much earlier than its official launch.  Although during the conference, representatives of the company promised to attract beta testers to test services and release only approved products to the market, but, despite these statements, beta testers were not involved, as they most likely knew about the problems at the design stages and could not would solve them. <br>  What are the problems of the third generation networks of MegaFon in practice? <br>  Judging by the map, located in the office of the company, at more than 600 thousand people of Novokuznetsk, in the central part of the city there are 2 (two) base stations.  Of course, with such a density of subscribers, constant brainwashing with Internet advertising at high speeds and unlimited tariffs, there is no need to talk about any quality of this service. <br>  Catching a third-generation network is possible only on the street, or in a window that goes to the locations of base stations, and the phone has to emit a signal with such force that its battery lasts for 20 minutes of the Internet or 15 conversations. <br>  Apparently because of the high load, services, especially the Internet, are unstable: the loss of communication, connection interruptions, network and server failures of the company. <br>  Perhaps this is only the beginning of work, but judging by the fact that the network has been in such a state for more than a month, there was only enough money for that. <br>  The big mistake of the company was to declare the beginning of commercial operation of the network (although they also took money for the services during the test period). <br>  In the center of testing the third generation network, which, by the way, is located in the building on which one of the base stations is installed, you can work on the Internet on a lenovo branded laptop.  Here one negative is superimposed on another: this subnotebook is terribly slow when working in IE, which is installed there.  The maximum that I managed to squeeze out of it was 438 kilobits / s for download and 38 kilobits / s for uploading data, i.e.  Essentially it's a good edge.  On a subnotebook, however, with the built-in modem there is an inscription of 7.2 Mbps, and the network indicator shows a 3.5G network (HSDPA). <br>  It should be said about tariffs: they were as inflated as they were, i.e.  if you want to just go online, then pay 7 rubles per megabyte, and if you want to save, you can go down to 2, but you need to seriously try, because with the latest innovations the company has confused the tariffs nowhere: you need to know where and when you connected and where you are now. <br>  With an unlimited tariff with a limit of one and a half gigabyte, after which they put you down at 48 kilobits / s, there was an interesting story in general, because until the last moment the operator was unaware of the existence of this restriction. <br>  If I worked in such a company, I would be ashamed to tell people about it. <br>  The post was like an excerpt from the complaint book, I apologize for me, but the essence is this: do not believe the statements that third-generation networks operate across the country, as there was no Internet in the outbacks and capitals, it did not even appear with the introduction of 3G. </div>
