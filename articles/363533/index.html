  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Durov.im or recall the history of allpeople.kz</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Surely, many of you are faced with the news ‚ÄúNew social network of Pavel Durov‚Äù or ‚ÄúNew secret of Durov‚Äù.  We all know who Durov is, what he did and does.  Another project, allegedly his durov.im, simply blew up the front page of news to some extent (take the same Yandex.News, which automatically collects news from fairly well-known sources and puts them in a general directory; you just have to enter durov.im in a general search Yandex news). <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Some may remember such a project as allpeople.kz.  The project is not very smart student (not very - this is still poorly said), who promised to become a shadow, and even more well-known "VKontakte".  For those who do not know or have forgotten who and what it is - I will explain.  Allpeople.kz is a fake project ‚Äúcreated‚Äù by a student from Kazakhstan who expects to reach the level of the CIS countries and Russia in the field of social networking.  Everything seems to be good, but there is one thing.  This project was just an ordinary engine from our ‚Äúexperienced‚Äù Ukrainian friends, the studio is niceweb.  The engine itself is a complete zero, as is its structure, but this is not the point.  At that moment, and it was either two, or a year and a half ago, our runet also flooded with a wave of reactions to such a statement from the founder of allpeople.kz.  Naturally, after the weekly DDoS attacks and constant bugs, the project subsided, Bekuzhin (the founder, like his name so) went underground, changed his name, surname and left for the Caribbean. <br><br>  But what do we see now?  Completely similar situation.  Only two differences.  The first is another engine, more literate.  The second is another schoolboy, more dumber.  At the moment, registration on durov.im goes on invites (similarly as in the situation with allpeople.kz), but I want to note that yesterday and the day before yesterday the site was subjected to DDoS attacks (again, hello to our Kazakh friend).  The situation is repeated.  People who have not really done anything for some reason attract too much attention to themselves, both from the public and from the media.  Whether zero correspondents who cannot check a material really sit. <br><br>  I am more than sure that this template engine, in which nothing has changed (you can‚Äôt imagine how I am bombed).  Even localize the engine, our "wise guy" can not.

      I think he will fail in a month.  There are two reasons.  The first is the constant DDoS attacks in order not to foul the name of Durov (what did they think about when creating and registering the durov.im domain?).  The second is the impossibility of further development.  It is unlikely that the owner of this project will somehow be able to make a ‚Äúzest‚Äù. <br><br>  And now proofs.  Evidence that this is a regular engine: <a href="https://www.humhub.org/">here</a> . <br>  For those who are too lazy to create a demo link, here is a second proof for you: <a href="https://www.google.ru/search%3Fq%3Dhumhub%26newwindow%3D1%26biw%3D1920%26bih%3D979%26source%3Dlnms%26tbm%3Disch%26sa%3DX%26ei%3Di2tzVJvvJ6W6ygPFxIHYCQ%26ved%3D0CAcQ_AUoAg">she will give</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/363533/">https://habr.com/ru/post/363533/</a></p>
