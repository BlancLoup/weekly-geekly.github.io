The promo video for <a href="https://whoer.net/">whoer.net was</a> conceived as a parody of the moment from The Matrix, when Morpheus leads Neo on the curriculum and talks about the Matrix.  But it‚Äôs good when there are people nearby who can direct and suggest that such ideas of a ‚Äúpensioner‚Äù are doomed more than completely.  As a ridicule, it even sounded: ‚ÄúYou would have thought up a parody on Johnny the mnemonic in 2016‚Äù. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  It is unpleasant to feel like a pensioner, but that is, that is, and everyone is fed up with the green-blue tones.  In general, the studio offered to keep up with the times and the visual range, rather than the old-school cyberpunk.

      Prepared and agreed on the text, it was traditionally pathetic.  But the text seems to have turned out, taken into work, smoothed and edited.  We checked time timings in different languages, edited it again and made a test voice acting to make sure that the + movie was in the format of 60‚Äì65 seconds for different languages. <br><br>  Began to think over and draw storyboard layouts, second by second.  In the course made small changes, some shots were removed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1fc/5d1/70c/1fc5d170cbf044deb2a23b36b008b98a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a64/7a9/26a/a647a926ac73436fbb749743764bd0fe.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  After the approval of all the layouts, the matter was behind the video design, and you had to find your own style.  Due to the fact that promo sites are usually made ‚Äúcartoonish‚Äù and drawn accordingly, the first pancake was frankly funny and lumpy: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/69ulqHGklgs%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhA7SBBya0FoSAhWAb3FWquc6PkGw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Not that, not at all.  They began to look for inspiration and ideas for a visual series, a completely different concept, watched a lot of material, modern films, and then someone remembered the game Watch Dogs (Russian ‚ÄúWatchdogs‚Äù).  This is a game in which everything is built around information security and information warfare.  Its visual component and technology of presenting information are excellent, and the style is very correct.  In a similar style, and it was decided to make a movie.  And that's what started to turn out: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/agdHuIJ0kEY%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgCL4UpO9zSOCSEO_yjCD6gFNR5bA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  The visual number we definitely liked.  A few words about the development itself.  The promo is done in Adobe After Effects CC, Autodesk 3ds Max was used to model a couple of dozens of plain models, most of the graphics were bought on various large drains and prepared using Photoshop CS6, and also drawn by hand.  Then begins the work of the video designer, collecting the sources together, adding various effects, camera turns, shifts, adjusting the video to the speaker‚Äôs timings. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/68c/759/6ad/68c7596ad979498e9453825de8e34c13.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  After the release of this intermediate version, it became clear that the background music is no good, as well as the announcer is not suitable for this video.  One got the feeling that he was reading a miner's instruction.  This means that we continue to work strictly on the layout of the storyboard on the visual series, and change the speaker and background music.  For the voice acting of the Russian version of the video, they really wanted to turn to <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2592%25D0%25B8%25D1%2585%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2,_%25D0%2592%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B8%25D1%2580_%25D0%2592%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B8%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D1%2587">Vladimir Vladimirovich Vikhrov</a> , but it turned out that he died tragically on September 6, 2010 ... It became literally a revelation how difficult it was to find a suitable announcer and background sound.  Dozens of auditioned listeners 10 times, hundreds of tracks on several drafts, many attempts to glue one to the other along with the sound producer - and it seems that something began to turn out: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q4ErIuLQM1E%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhXSzEldxL1keWb3VUVKt8pvP8fgw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Not bad!  Now the final touch: we select and apply several effects to the voice of the announcer, and the release of the Russian version is ready: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/39krfoMHosk%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjLZ8umIbfIKNtwNLAuSyJ-OMbH3Q" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  But lucky with the speaker for the English version of the video, he was found very quickly and immediately as the doctor ordered.  English version: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/J-oNOEXNIrE%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjPo3A3631RDz7bNjvX0DANneZXuw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  The team of our project is very grateful to <a href="http://1nstudio.ru/">1nstudio</a> for the work done and for the successful cooperation.
