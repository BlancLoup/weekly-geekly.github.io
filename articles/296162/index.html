      An example is cloud services.  They did not appear yesterday, but a significant portion of companies are still afraid to give control of their IT infrastructure to the outside. <br><br>  At the same time, maintaining your own server fleet is becoming an increasingly costly measure: it is necessary to allocate capital investment, incur costs for administrators' wages, and maintain your hardware. <br><br>  What can companies do to correct this situation? <br><br><h3>  Rule 1 - Openness </h3><br>  The new technology will not tell about itself, and for those who are not an IT specialist it will be difficult to understand the intricacies of its device and assess the potential benefits to the full. <br><br>  Representatives of the company should evaluate those channels that are most convenient and familiar to their audience.  This opportunity gives a feeling of confidence that you are ready to solve any difficulties and answer customer questions. <br><br>  Another significant plus of the policy of openness is that you can use your corporate blog to share experiences in solving certain technological problems - to show how your product or service works in the real world. <br><br>  The third factor that will allow you to call a truly open company is the availability of thematic guides, in which simple words answer the most frequent questions, provide step-by-step instructions and tips for beginners. <br><br>  This tool allows you not only to give people the opportunity to act independently, but also to reduce the load of support services regardless of your business profile. <br><br><h3>  Rule 2 - What I pay for </h3><br>  If we are talking about a new technology that does not have so many competitors, the client may feel uncomfortable due to the fact that he simply does not have information about how much it costs other companies.  Even relatively well-established businesses, such as IaaS providers, still have problems with how to make their pricing clear and transparent. <br><br>  We decided to continue our policy of openness and willingness to help even those who are not IT professionals, and made a special calculator that allows you to quickly assess the level of the necessary costs for certain cloud resources. <br><br>  We placed this tool on the main page site in order to immediately set the required level of expectations.  Such solutions in combination with automation of service systems allowed us to increase the service income by 8 times within one year of work. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6c6/104/fcc/6c6104fcc0cb45029ca2d0600b3e6027.png"><br><br><h3>  Rule 3 - This is a developer problem. </h3><br>  Sophisticated interface, technical problems, high load of support services - all this does not bother your customers.  Few people are interested in delving into the details of the structure of your business processes and the various difficulties associated with the work of your IT specialists. <br><br>  We believe that a company should be able to identify bottlenecks using tools for analytics and monitoring.  At the same time, it is important to hear customers and to be attentive to criticism. <br><br>  This approach has directed us towards the creation of automated ‚Äúsetup wizards‚Äù for working with the virtual infrastructure of our IaaS provider.  These solutions help you perform basic tasks in seconds - you can create and configure a new server in just a couple of minutes. <br><br>  These nuances may not affect your revenue the first time they are commissioned, but they will necessarily change the attitude of your customers to what you do for their convenience.  Such trust is in many ways the starting point for stable and long-term growth of the company. <br><br>  PS Other materials about the work of our IaaS provider: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/1cloud/blog/281889/">How to create a virtual infrastructure provider: Experience 1cloud</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/1cloud/blog/280748/">Client-oriented "cloud": Experience 1cloud</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/1cloud/blog/278479/">Photo tour of the "cloud" of 1cloud</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/1cloud/blog/278055/">A little about data storage and experience 1cloud</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/1cloud/blog/277155/">UI Optimization: Experience 1cloud</a> </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/296162/">https://habr.com/ru/post/296162/</a></p>
