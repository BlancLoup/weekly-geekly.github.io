  <section class="page js-page"><h1>An attempt to make the state web more beautiful or three guest-stands in three weeks ...</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  This is not the first and, of course, not the last friendship of <a href="http://www.artsofte.ru/">our studio</a> with the resource <a href="http://zakupki.gov.ru/">http://zakupki.gov.ru</a> and in general with state customers.  Sometimes we are friends with them successfully, sometimes not. <br><br>  Anyway, the presence, in the list of developers of state resources, professional web teams is still very rare. <br><br>  From the last thing that was done, I really respect the projects of the Gorbunov bureau - for the <a href="http://flag.kremlin.ru/">flag</a> and the <a href="http://constitution.kremlin.ru/">constitution of the Russian Federation</a> , but more often, in the development of the state web-site, I see irresponsible projects that poorly correspond to the ‚Äúprice = amount of work = quality execution. "  Projects such as the new site of the pension fund of the Russian Federation for almost 3 million, where, as part of the estimated work, at least the new ‚ÄúToyota Prado‚Äù should be buried at least :), in the appendage to the site, for the purposes of its support. <br>  The past calendar month, marked by the numerological event 09/09/09, thoroughly shook my IT-psyche. <a name="habracut"></a>

    <h4>  At the entrance: </h4><br><ul><li>  Three tenders, one of which with a pledge bid with the traditional 2% of the quotation. </li><li>  The publication on <a href="http://zakupki.gov.ru/">zakupki.gov.ru</a> , of course, late) =&gt; over a short deadline for preparation </li><li>  <a href="http://www.artsofte.ru/">Serious experience in the background</a> and the desire to win at least one of the three. </li></ul><br><br><h4>  The process of strain of the psyche: </h4><br><h5>  Tender # 1 </h5><br>  A small remark in the footer barely noticeable font, on one of the 164 pages of the tender documentation, that all deadlines indicated in the schedule of works should be ‚Äú-30 days‚Äù from the deadlines indicated in the tender information card, crossed all efforts to prepare multikilogram application. <br><br>  Verdict - inconsistency of the deadline for the tender documentation. <br>  What can be done is nothing ... As they say - to so: ... <br><br><h5>  Tender ‚Ññ2 </h5><br>  Availability of the delivered DHL package on time to the address indicated, tracking of the air waybill confirming this, personalized list of the department staff confirming the receipt with a specific date and time, not a feat for the tender organizers to open an application for consideration.  She was ‚Äúaccidentally‚Äù not brought to the commission for opening the envelopes, directly violating the law ‚ÄúOn placing orders‚Äù 94-FZ. <br><br>  As a result, the application is not in the list of applicants ... and welcome to the FAS Russia (the complaint had to be sent twice) :-) <br><br><h5>  Tender ‚Ññ3 </h5><br>  Excellent project, except for one but ... a prerequisite for creating a system to use 5php, postgreSQL, etc.  (well, there are no problems with this) and ... have a license for a box called ‚ÄúDIRECTION OF THE PORT‚Äù, and for some reason only do it on it. <br><br>  I still understand when a question in a support of an existing resource working on a box, but when absolutely zero development is immediately tied to an incomprehensible CMS, this is very strange. <br><br>  Someone heard something about such a CCM?  And why only on it you need to write projects?  Another violation of the law "On placing orders" 94-FZ. " <br><br>  In the application, we suggested using the Symfony Framework for the project, which, provided that all the requirements of the TOR were fully met, and even with the slide offered improvements. <br><br>  The verdict is the discrepancy between the tender documentation and why the applied and proposed technologies are a head taller than some unintelligible box and the stated price is more competitive. <br><br>  Who is the winner?  From 100% of the possible maximum cost of quotations, the tender is selected by the company ‚ÄúDIRECTION.RU‚Äù - all the others go through the forest. <br><br>  The complaint to the FAS did not have time to file for their own reasons - they were distracted by other projects. <br><br><h4>  In the dry residue: </h4><br><ul><li>  Turnaround pulled out of the studio in the amount of 200 K for 6.5 weeks </li><li>  Return of the pledge for 3 weeks after the statutory 5 working days from the moment of determining the winner; </li><li>  2 complaints to FAS </li><li>  1 contest is invalid </li><li>  Khrenova cloud of phone bills - well, a lot </li><li>  5 DHL shipments each, on average, 3-4 kilo = 15 K rubles </li><li>  Payroll for the preparation of documentation </li><li>  A bunch of personal time - 24 \ 7 </li><li>  The psychological state of the staff involved in training - priceless </li></ul><br><br><h4>  Can I win?  Yes, it is possible, but provided: </h4><br><ul><li>  You have a really good application and you bite into every line of delusional - two hundred page tender documents that often violate the procurement law, not missing any notes in the footers that affect the vital indicators of your application, and at the same time printed with 7-8 pins and pale gray font </li><li>  You are lucky and the tender is not ottktatny (it happens :-)) </li><li>  You have incredible psychological resistance to bureaucratic fuss. </li><li>  The desire to openly hack in every instance and really do it. </li><li>  Well, of course the ability to do what is the subject of all this fuss. </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/71276/">https://habr.com/ru/post/71276/</a></p>
