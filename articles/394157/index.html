      I want to start with a response from Guillermo Bonilla, who <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-examples-of-two-hit-wonders">says</a> that “groups of two hits” are much less common than “groups of one hit”.  “The group’s song becomes a hit when it is“ knocked out ”of the collective’s general style, and not everyone can try to repeat such a trick,” Guillermo notes. <br><br>  However, according <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-examples-of-two-hit-wonders">to</a> Kais Makarainen (Kajsa Makarainen), you can select a number of musicians, known for two songs.  In the lists of American “musicians of one hit”, sometimes the band The Buoys appears with the song “ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3Dii1FGESbxO8">Timothy</a> ”, telling about people who are under the rubble in the mine and are forced to sink to cannibalism.  However, in Europe the band is known with another song - “ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3Dci3quJw-fek">Give Up Your Guns</a> ”. <br><br>  Another example is Gloria Gaynor.  Gloria in the seventies had two superhits in the disco style.  The first is a cover of the song “ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DCCSvNZWpXaM">Never Can Say Goodbye</a> ”, which became an international hit in 1974.  After 4 years, she released an album with the song “ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DZBR2G-iI3-I">I Will Survive</a> ”, which immediately came out on top in the Billboard Hot 100 chart and in 1980 received the Grammy Award as “Best Disco Composition”. <br><br>  An incalculable amount of cover versions was made on it, and it was even performed in stadiums.  The song is sung about a woman who is experiencing a break in relations with a loved one and gathers the strength to live on. <br><br>  Irishman Johnny Logan won Eurovision in 1980 with the song “What's Another Year”, taking off to the top of the European charts.  After that, he landed in the "pit of unproductiveness" and for a long time could not create a hit.  Only seven years later, he again won Eurovision with the song “ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DqURxESCEENc">Hold Me Now</a> ”, becoming the only person who won first place in this contest twice. <br><br>  After that, another set of failures awaited him, so to speak, and only 4 years later he won Eurovision again, but already as a composer, writing a song for Linda Martin “Why Me”.  As a singer, he remains an excellent example of the "two hit singer". <br><br>  As for the group Kaoma, then it can be called "a group of one and a half hit."  In 1989, the band blew up the dance floors with the song “ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DiyLdoQGBchQ">Lambada</a> ”, which turned out to be a translation of a song by another group, which led to a trial.  In the wake of the success, the guys from Kaoma released (this time the original) song “ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DvXr-X-cqpAk">Dancando Lambada</a> ”, which was in the top 10 of several European countries. <br><br>  Lorenzo Peroni (Lorenzo Peroni), a popular author on Quora, <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-examples-of-two-hit-wonders">mentioned</a> only one performer: French pop singer F.R.  David's  Although he <a href="https://goo.gl/tmI6Ih">has been</a> on the stage for almost 50 years, most people know him from two songs of 1982: “ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DPTsSk0r_Tq8">Words (Don't Come Easy)</a> ” and “ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3Dc6myFY3EwsA">Pick Up The Phone</a> ”. <br><br>  John Pennington also <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-examples-of-two-hit-wonders">joined</a> the discussion and led his own small list of “two hit artists” known in the USA. <br><br><ul><li>  In the first place on his list is the band The Beau Brummels with the songs " <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DhQ4WE0GviLg">Laugh Laugh</a> " and " <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DQvZjldFCzco">Just a Little</a> ". </li></ul><br><ul><li>  On the second - The Electric Prunes and “ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DF-kVFfKezVo">I Had Too Much to Dream Last Night</a> ”, “ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3Dm-OasgfSzNE">Get Me to the World on Time</a> ”. </li></ul><br><ul><li>  Next - The Spin Doctors " <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3Dwsdy_rct6uo">Two Princes</a> " and " <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DcXWbMu4PtpE">Little Miss Can't Be Wrong</a> ". </li></ul><br><ul><li>  a-ha with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DdjV11Xbc914">Take On Me</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3Da3ir9HC9vYg">The Sun Always Shines on TV</a> . </li></ul><br><ul><li>  Falco with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DcVikZ8Oe_XA">Rock Me Amadeus</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D9MVMl9DSHnI">Vienna Calling</a> . </li></ul><br><ul><li>  Golden Earring with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DZf53Pg2AkdY">Radar Love</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3Da1sf2CzEq0w">Twilight Zone</a> . </li></ul><br><ul><li>  The Shadows of Knight from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DNdAezc-RX-o">Gloria</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DGHjEvIFQ7zk">Oh Yeah</a> . </li></ul><br><ul><li>  Jefferson Airplane with “ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D2EdLasOrG6c">Somebody to Love</a> ” and “ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DYfASumLhC2U">White Rabbit</a> ”. </li></ul><br><ul><li>  Vanilla Fudge with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3Ds2z8TpFV748">You Keep Me Hangin 'On</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3Dcg98zELQxkI">Take Me for a Little While</a> . </li></ul><br>  James O'Connor, in the hope of spurring the conversation, <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-examples-of-two-hit-wonders">led</a> his list of groups.  Here are some of them. <br><br><ul><li>  The Knack group and the songs “ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DuRLuIm2Bjgk">My Sharona</a> ”, “ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DSc4l5EpCMEc">Good Girls Don't</a> ”. </li></ul><br><ul><li>  The Left Banke with “ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DSqAh1dQu_pg">Walk Away Renee</a> ” and “ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D8rzeGqqethE">Pretty Ballerina</a> ”. </li></ul><br><ul><li>  The Romantics and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DJmGMzyajA2U">Talking In Your Sleep</a> , as well as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DJGAV8wvYdVI">One In A Million</a> . </li></ul><br><ul><li>  The Tubes " <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DJxmpfHmZHSM">Don't Want To Wait Anymore</a> " and " <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DmQ_k_VG6Syc">She's A Beauty</a> ." </li></ul><br><ul><li>  The latest on the list is the Crowded House team with “ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DJ9gKyRmic20">Don't Dream It's Over</a> ” and “ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DWyBKzBtaKWM">Something So Strong</a> ”. </li></ul><br>  According <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-examples-of-two-hit-wonders">to</a> writer Chris Jordan (Chrys Jordan), the term “group of two hits” was first used in relation to the Sugar Ray team.  In 1997, mixing rock and roll and hip-hop, they released the hit " <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DzUtnwcv-quE">Fly</a> ".  Critics considered Sugar Ray a one-day group and said that their 15 minutes of fame would soon be over. <br><br>  But in 1999 the group released the album “14:59”, as if to say: “Our 15 minutes of glory has just begun!”.  The album was their second hit - " <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D3cqU1pFRqYE">Every Morning</a> ".  At this moment, 15 minutes of glory really ended. <br><br>  Singer Adam Starritt (Adam Starritt) as an example of a "group of two songs" <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-examples-of-two-hit-wonders">leads</a> Toploader.  These guys gained fame by performing the song "Dancing in the Moonlight". <br><br>  “Like many novice performers, they didn’t expect their work to become so popular,” Adam said.  “She even bothered many people, so often she could be heard.”  But the song raised the bar of expectations high enough, and <a href="https://youtu.be/0yBnIUX0QAE">Toploader</a> itself could not jump over it. <br><br>  Their next composition “ <a href="https://youtu.be/MeT2dZHjaJs">Achilles Hill</a> ”, although it became a hit, turned out to be much weaker than “Dancing in the Moonlight”. <br><br><blockquote>  Adam notes: “In the music industry there is a saying:“ When a song gets bigger than you, you die ”.  Not literally, of course.  This is what happened with Toploader. ” </blockquote><br>  Daniel Landström <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-examples-of-two-hit-wonders">writes</a> about the band Mr.  Mister, whose success did not last long.  In 1985, she released the hits " <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D9NDjt4FzFWY">Kyrie</a> " and " <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DnKhN1t_7PEY">Broken Wings</a> ".  “However, they have another hit, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DnWxxRlVNM30">Is It Love</a> ,” <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-examples-of-two-hit-wonders">says</a> Daniel, “so they can be considered a group of three hits.” <br><br>  Eric Heiss, a professional musician, also <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-examples-of-two-hit-wonders">shared</a> his opinion: “A group of two hits” can be called the Marillion team.  Although the guys continue to release albums and go on tour, their two loudest hits are " <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DOQ4oaLUilBc">Kayleigh</a> " and " <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DRrtJjbqAvwA">You're gone</a> ". <br><br>  “Marillion had other singles that were popular outside the States, but they didn’t even stand around with the ones mentioned above,” concludes Eric. <br><br>  <i>PS More materials on the topic of audio - in our blog " <a href="http://www.audiomania.ru/mirhifi/">Hi-Fi World</a> ".</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/394157/">https://habr.com/ru/post/394157/</a></p>
