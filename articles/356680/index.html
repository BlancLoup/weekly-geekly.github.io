While she was secretary of state, she did not use her business address, but instead raised her own mail server, registered from her parents' home in New York, AP <a href="http://bigstory.ap.org/article/b78ba433af3a45209668f745158d994c/clinton-ran-homebrew-computer-system-official-emails">writes</a> . <br><br>  The point here is not only in the technical advancement of the state secretary, but in the reasons that prompted her to do so.  There is a version that in this way Clinton tried to circumvent the standard procedure for archiving all official letters, as provided for by the Federal Records Act. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  This practice suggests that the Secretary of State was more responsible in maintaining confidential information.  In this sense, it is clearly superior to other well-known politicians, such as Mitt Romney or Sarah Palin, who are famous for using free mail services from Microsoft and Yahoo to correspond.

      Clinton herself does not explain the purpose for which she <i>opened the hdr22@clintonemail.com</i> mailbox under the pseudonym of Eric Hoteham in August 2010.  Perhaps, at the request of Hillary, a technical adviser did this.  Another email server is linked to the same pseudonym presidentclinton.com and the now not functioning wjcoffice.com website. <br><br>  On the other hand, artisanal email servers are usually not distinguished by high reliability, protection against hacking or loss of information, like services in professional data centers.  According to records, in November 2012, Clinton‚Äôs personal mail server was configured to back up emails to Google‚Äôs inbox.  Then, in July 2013, it was reconfigured again for use by the MX Logic email provider, it is now owned by McAfee, which specializes in information security related products. <br><br>  In theory, under the Freedom of Information Act (US Freedom of Information Act), a US citizen or a foreign citizen can access the contents of Hillary Clinton's official correspondence by making a request to open non-classified information.  In practice, it is not known what specific part of its mail archive the former secretary of state transferred to the State Department. <br><br>  In general, competent archiving of electronic materials is a very laborious matter.  One intelligence agency generates <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/04/opinion/what-hillary-clintons-emails-really-reveal.html">approximately 1 petabyte of classified documents</a> every 18 months.  According to the National Archives, the permanent work of two million employees is required to read and declassify this bureaucratic product.  Instead, there are only 41 archivists in the organization. <br><br>  The declassification of documents from the authorities is a big problem.  At the end of the 90s, more than 200 million documents were declassified per year, and now this figure is around 30 million. And this is despite the fact that the flow of documents with limited access has grown significantly.  Much just has to destroy, the rest is lost.  For example, no one knows where the US diplomatic correspondence is for the 70s.  She just can not find. <br><br>  In other words, the state has stopped performing one of its basic functions: to report to citizens on what it is doing on their behalf. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/356680/">https://habr.com/ru/post/356680/</a></p>
