There will be two streams - for startups and for companies with an established sales system (we will pay a lot of attention to outsourcing).

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  The following reports will be presented at the <a href="http://geekslab.co/events/bigdatalab">Al &amp; BigData Lab</a> conference: </h4><br>  <b><i>‚ÄúNatural Language Processing in Practice‚Äù (Vsevolod Demkin, Grammarly)</i></b> <br>  Natural Language Processing is an area at the intersection of practical software engineering and computer science (algorithms, machine learning and statistics).  It includes many different tasks and, accordingly, approaches and methods for their solution. <br>  The key factor in the success of any NLP project is qualitative data, so first of all we will talk about where to get them and how to work with it. <br>  Next come various models and algorithms.  We will briefly review the main tools (from the Bayes theorem to deep neural networks) that are used in NLP and discuss in what conditions which are preferable. <br>  Unlike conventional software engineering, in NLP most of the time and effort is spent not on writing a program, but on experiments.  This is a specific type of activity that requires its own approaches - and we will discuss them. <br>  Finally, we will look at how to collect all this into a single whole and get the finished product using the real world as an example of solving a problem using publicly available data. <br><br>  <i><b>‚ÄúData mining and information search: problems, algorithms, solutions‚Äù (Alexander Krakovetsky, DevRain Solutions)</b></i> <br>  Every day we use search engines - Google, Bing, Yandex and others.  Modern search engines provide fairly accurate results, but, nevertheless, are not without flaws.  At a time when the amount of information increases exponentially every year, even small improvements in the work of search engines can significantly reduce all information gathering, analysis and search, as well as save users time. <br>  The report will discuss the problems of information retrieval - duplicate information, a huge amount of informational garbage, a lot of time searching for ‚Äúnon-trivial‚Äù data. <br>  The report will not be devoted to any specific Data Mining area or algorithm, but will concern several areas from the Text Mining, clustering, NLP, SEO areas at once to solve a specific task - reducing the time for searching for the necessary information.  In addition, you will learn how the services a la Readability, and how they can improve search algorithms. <br><br>  <i><b>‚ÄúDeepLearning: Complex Data Analysis in Simple Words‚Äù (Sergey Shelpuk, SoftServe)</b></i> <br>  The amount of data is growing at a tremendous pace, and humanity does not have enough resources to label and process this data before analysis.  In this regard, algorithms that work with unmarked data (unsupervisedlearning), come out on top of the potential for practical application.  Deeplearning neural networks is one of the most powerful algorithms for analyzing unmarked data to date.  Based on the concept of the brain and the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa unified teaching algorithm, this approach shows the best results on a large range of data analysis problems: video, image, sound, text and others. <br>  Creation of deeplearning neural networks requires an intuitive understanding of the principles of their work, as well as large computing power.  Parallel computing on a GPU is one of the ways to get these powers.  Learning deeplearning neural networks on a GPU is by far the most efficient and cheapest way to work with them. <br>  This report will be devoted to explaining the principles of deeplearning networks in simple words, algorithmic techniques that make this training effective, and technological tools that allow you to build networks in the fastest and cheapest way. <br><br>  <i><b>‚ÄúAn interesting job for every day: AI in ordinary corporate applications‚Äù (Alexander Slipchenko, Intranel Ltd)</b></i> <br>  The report is devoted to how AI and ML can find application in corporate applications that have written the ascomin and even breathe new life into them.  Consider the entire life cycle of the task: from the general idea (which does not necessarily ‚Äúsound like AI‚Äù), through the formal formulation of the problem, several iterations of prototyping - to implementation and launch.  The guinea pig will be BizCrowd.com, designed for the Royal Bank of Scotland.  Formally, the most difficult task of classifying text data, being squeezed into the framework of a project with a fixed budget and time limit, can both become a source of headache and bring many interesting discoveries. <br>  In addition, we will talk about how to set the task so that it does not have to re-design the bike;  How to set up an algorithm and where to get data for this while you do not have users (and, accordingly, data);  what to do if the source material leaves much to be desired;  SOLR;  How to convince the customer that life after release is just beginning. <br><br>  <i><b>‚ÄúWhat is data visualization, or why specialists working with data should be slightly artists‚Äù (Vladimir Timashov, DataArt)</b></i> <br>  For centuries, mankind has been accumulating information, and Big Data has increased millions of times of useful information.  The raw data itself is useless, and we constantly have a problem to present this data to the end user, to see trends and key points.  And here we can come to the aid of data visualization, which in capable hands can transform the data and present it in a favorable light. <br>  In the report we will go over different stages of visualization.  Let's look at approaches to the visual presentation of information.  We will touch on technical solutions available today for custom development (d3.js, Raphael, Three.js), and ready-made Enterprise products (Tableau, QlikView).  Let's look at the use of visualization in real projects - made in DataArt, and world leaders in this field. <br><br>  <i><b>‚ÄúAI &amp; BigData for travelers‚Äù (Yuri Kuznetsov, Senturia)</b></i> <br>  The practice of working with big data in the online service.
