      Only the main hall will be broadcast in open access; if you want to watch the other <strong>9 halls</strong> , you can also purchase <a href="http://conf.ontico.ru/conference/join/hl2017.html%3Fpopup%3D2%26utm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dmedia%26utm_campaign%3Dhighload.2017%26utm_content%3Dopenvideo">private access</a> . <br><br>  The full schedule is available on the website ( <a href="http://www.highload.ru/pdf-hl-2017/hl.pdf">PDF</a> , <a href="http://www.highload.ru/2017/schedule.html%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dmedia%26utm_campaign%3Dhighload.2017%26utm_content%3Dopenvideo">HTML</a> ), and we will tell you about the most interesting reports in the roll-up. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Life after sharding </h2><br>  <font color="gray">November 8, 14:00</font> <br><br>  Many people think that in order to create a good highload project, it is necessary to load data in a proper way and sleep well, delivering the server as needed.  In fact, it is only after sharding that the most interesting begins, since after physical separation the data does not cease to be logically related. <br><br>  <strong>Mikhail Kurmaev</strong> from Badoo <a href="http://www.highload.ru/2017/abstracts/2930.html%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dmedia%26utm_campaign%3Dhighload.2017%26utm_content%3Dopenvideo">will talk</a> about how they solved problems of this class with the MySQL database.  We will discuss both the typical problems outside of sharding, and the process of its construction itself: the processing of real-time events, queues in geographically separated data centers and much more. <br><br><h2>  As I was a team leader, and now - the head of the direction </h2><br>  <font color="gray">November 8, 11:00</font> <br><br>  In the report of <strong>Vitaly Sharovatov</strong> from Badoo, he <a href="http://www.highload.ru/2017/abstracts/3022.html%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dmedia%26utm_campaign%3Dhighload.2017%26utm_content%3Dopenvideo">will talk about two</a> topics: how the growth from the team leader looks to the head of the department, and how to choose the team leader to replace him, to help him become effective. <br><br>  We will talk a little about psychology, about the atmosphere in the team, mentoring, of course, about hiring and much more.  From Vitaly's speech you will learn how: <br><br><ul><li>  <strong>correctly choose a team leader</strong> : based on what criteria, how to check how a person can approach, how to sell the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa career change and deal with classical fears; </li><li>  <strong>to help the chosen person to</strong> confidently enter into the course of business and become as efficient as possible, to fight; </li><li>  <strong>monitor the situation</strong> in the teams and keep your hand ‚Äúon the pulse‚Äù; </li><li>  <strong>stop leading the team yourself</strong> , and how lead management differs from developer management. </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/l0/zs/se/l0zsse3lldkkv2xnkpbpu-akogu.png" alt="image"><br><br>  2017 headliner <strong>Mikhail Sychev</strong> from Google with a report <br><br><h2>  YouTube.com Reconstruction - rewriting the second most popular website in the world </h2><br>  <font color="gray">November 7, 13:00</font> <br><blockquote>  I <a href="http://www.highload.ru/2017/abstracts/3089.html%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dmedia%26utm_campaign%3Dhighload.2017%26utm_content%3Dopenvideo">'ll tell you</a> why we decided (and only now) to switch to a client-side-application, how we evaluate the performance of YouTube (and why "Time To Glass" and "Above the Fold" is only the beginning of the story), as front-end and back -end work together to achieve maximum performance when business logic is designed for dozens of clients. <br><br>  We will discuss why we chose Polymer as a framework for the site (no, not just because Google made it), a new development platform based on it, A / B testing and ‚Äúexperiments‚Äù to evaluate changes and control user reactions, and which metrics we pay attention to ... </blockquote><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/io/r8/kg/ior8kgrjaj3lurk4xutttey0fba.png" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  Quality control of highly loaded systems </h2><br>  <font color="gray">November 8, 12:00</font> <br><br>  Agree that building high-load systems blindly is unrealistic?  How to build quality control in the development of complex services?  <strong>What exactly to look for when testing performance?</strong>  The topic of testing loaded systems has been covered more than once at many conferences; there are a lot of articles, blog entries, instructions from vendors.  A huge pile of information. <br><br>  Without training in this abundance of tips and solutions, you can easily get confused and waste precious time on testing and wasting quality control.  And you can listen to <strong>Andrei Drozdov</strong> with a story about how the quality control of loaded systems in Avito is arranged. <br><br>  In his story, Andrew <a href="http://www.highload.ru/2017/abstracts/2972.html%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dmedia%26utm_campaign%3Dhighload.2017%26utm_content%3Dopenvideo">will tell you</a> how to build a system for testing and controlling the quality of services from scratch.  Together with you, we will hear about fault tolerance, automation, see what tools Avito uses and what they do.  And we will also see how correctly selected metrics and accurate accounting. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/yx/5r/qy/yx5rqypgiwd0vedtmqhl8y2b1hi.png" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  Effective use of ClickHouse </h2><br>  <font color="gray">November 8, 15:00</font> <br><br>  ClickHouse just over a year is available in open-source.  During this time, gained experience in its use in Russian and foreign companies.  In some of them, data volumes and loads exceed those with which we deal in Yandex.  Since ClickHouse is a specialized system, it is important to take into account the peculiarities of its architecture. <br><br>  In his report, <strong>Alexey Milovidov</strong> <a href="http://www.highload.ru/2017/abstracts/2992.html%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dmedia%26utm_campaign%3Dhighload.2017%26utm_content%3Dopenvideo">will talk</a> about examples of typical mistakes when using ClickHouse, which can lead to inefficient work.  The examples from practice will show how the choice of a particular data processing scheme can change the performance by orders of magnitude. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zk/m6/dm/zkm6dmk2hkheowwnrwktsjincva.png" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  How to rewrite the VK private messages database from scratch and migrate to it without downtime </h2><br>  <font color="gray">November 7, 6 pm</font> <br><br>  For many years, private messages in the social network <strong>VKontakte</strong> worked on the same samopritny database.  Over time, it is morally obsolete, making it difficult to implement a new functional, and the growing loads have led to the fact that a <strong>huge number of servers are</strong> required for the functioning of the messenger. <br><br>  Dmitry Egorov <a href="http://www.highload.ru/2017/abstracts/3088.html%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dmedia%26utm_campaign%3Dhighload.2017%26utm_content%3Dopenvideo">will talk</a> about how, within 10 months, a new message storage system was developed from scratch and removed many architectural constraints, as well as having much higher productivity, which allowed the company to save millions of dollars!  The report will discuss the architecture of both personal message engines, many optimizations, and the technically most difficult part ‚Äî migration without downtime ‚Äî is described in detail. <br><br><h2>  Interesting? </h2><br>  Everything, we go to Skolkovo for construction, and we are waiting for you on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DBlDK2KKKYc8">online broadcast</a> :) <br><br><h2>  See you! </h2><br>  <font color="darkgray">PS: By the way, <a href="https://www.ngenix.net/%3Futm_source%3Dhighload">NGENIX</a> delivers and accelerates the broadcast, for which she thanks a lot!</font>  <font color="darkgray">And the technical director of the company, Dmitry Krikov, together with Alexander Petrovsky from <a href="http://ru.mellanox.com/%3Futm_source%3Dhighload">Mellanox,</a> will read on HighLoad ++ a report entitled " <a href="http://www.highload.ru/2017/abstracts/3021">Disaggregation and openness on Ethernet networks</a> ".</font> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/341600/">https://habr.com/ru/post/341600/</a></p>
