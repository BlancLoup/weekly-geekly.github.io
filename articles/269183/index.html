Create your application </h3><br>  We will not discuss in this article how to create applications for Office and SharePoint.  This is covered in detail in other materials published in our series.  Let's just say about some of the nuances.

      To learn how to get started, visit <a href="http://dev.office.com/getting-started">http://dev.office.com/getting-started</a> <br>  To develop an application, you can choose different IDEs, for example, Visual Studio 2015. Do not forget to download Office Developer Tools from <a href="http://visualstudio.com/">http://visualstudio.com</a> .  The same tool will help you create an Application Package / Manifest.  To the application manifest was ready for publication, it is worth considering the following recommendations: <br><br><ol><li>  While downloading an application, be careful in choosing the name of the application, since: <br><ol><li>  The name in the manifest is the name that the user will see after installing the application in Office or SharePoint </li><li>  The name in the Sales Dashboard is how the app will be called in the Store. </li><li>  The mismatch of these two names may confuse the user. </li><li>  Use the Manifest Display Name (Office Applications) or Title Element (SharePoint Applications) </li></ol><br></li><li>  You need to download the icons for the App Store twice, in two different places. </li><li>  Provider-hosted SharePoint Store applications require the use of Seller Dash for Client IDs and Secrets <br><ol><li>  Client IDs and Secrets allow remote application components to access SharePoint data without user permissions </li><li>  When you make apps for the Store, you cannot use SharePoint to create IDs and Secrets </li><li>  These elements created with SD are then added to the web.config and manifest files in your project in Visual Studio. </li></ol><br></li></ol><br><h3>  Step 2. Creating an Account in the Sales Dashboard </h3><br>  If you plan to publish applications or add-ons in the Office Store, you first need to create a user or organization account in the Sales Dashboard.  If you want to sell your solutions, you also need to add payout details. <br><br>  <b>Note:</b> <em>If your company is already registered with Microsoft stores using a Microsoft account, you must use the same account to register with the Sales Dashboard.</em>  <em>You cannot register a company in the Sales Dashboard using another Microsoft account.</em>  <em>The information provided must correspond to the information provided at Microsoft stores using this account.</em>  <em>For example, you must specify the same company name and address.</em> <br><br>  When registering, please note that selecting the account type once (individual or organization), you can not change it later.  You will have to create a new account. <br><br>  Your account also includes a marketing profile.  From your marketing profile, customers will learn about your experiences, as well as how your applications and add-ons will help them cope with their business tasks.  A well-thought-out marketing profile will increase your chances to interest potential customers.  Do not forget about grammar, about the uniqueness of information, about its completeness.  This will help to get approval for registration. <br><br>  Do not forget to use the recommendations of Microsoft.  From you can find in the relevant section of the documentation (see, for example, <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/RU-RU/library/jj635874.aspx">https://msdn.microsoft.com/RU-RU/library/jj635874.aspx</a> ) <br><br>  Let's take a step by step process of creating an account in the Sales Monitoring Panel. <br><br><ol><li>  Sign in to the Sales Dashboard using a Microsoft account.  If you or your company does not have a Microsoft account, click the <b>Register</b> button.  You can only associate one Microsoft account with a company. <br></li><li>  Enter your personal information.  If you are creating a company account, provide the contact details of the company administrator by filling in the First Name, Last Name and Contact E-mail fields. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/86f/420/bc6/86f420bc6dc14602b5ca3ddb8cbacbd0.png"><br><br></li><li>  Specify information about the place of residence or the legal address of the company. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/311/a46/4d5/311a464d518546468ac1b9ef91d2ebfb.png"><br></li><li>  In the account type section, make sure that the correct item is selected, and then click NEXT </li><li>  On the next page fill out your marketing profile. </li><li>  You need to choose a display name.  This is the name by which customers will recognize you in the Office Store.  Do not forget that the name must be unique throughout the Store, otherwise it will not be approved. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f30/b56/71d/f30b5671d015468792878c427d88452a.png"><br><br></li><li>  Next, you need to add your logo.  You can leave the ‚Äúdefault logo‚Äù, but if you want users to recognize you right away from the picture, try to create something impressive and memorable.  The size of the image should be 96x96 pixels, weight - no more than 250 kV.  Do not forget to check the logo for viruses before downloading. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a0f/b75/46e/a0fb7546ea6746848d4964d15dac12ef.png"><br><br></li><li>  Give a description of you or your company.  In the description, specify what will be important for the client to know about you, in order to start trusting you, as a professional, enough to select your application and install it in your business environment.  Think about what would have impressed you if you read such a description.  The text should be simple, not contain complex formatting.  If you want to add clauses, you can use hyphens or [#LI] and [/ # LI] tags.  And again I remind you, check the grammar. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/71a/e65/99b/71ae6599bc62429191f7423338363bea.png"><br><br></li><li>  Specify a website where customers can learn more about you and your application.  You must be the owner of the site and the site must be working.  URL must begin with http: // or https: // <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/93a/063/b10/93a063b104a94c55ab6e2aef56c775b1.png"><br><br></li><li>  Click the "Submit for approval" button. <br>  The process of creating a company account and an individual record differ very slightly. <br>  At the end of the process on the dashboard we will see the following picture: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2d9/f07/408/2d9f07408c1f4d8eb0080b3d836c81fa.png"><br><br></li></ol><br>  It now remains to wait for the application to be reviewed and approved.  How long will it take to wait? <br><br>  From one day to two weeks.  If in two weeks the status of the application will still be in the state ‚ÄúACCOUNT EXPECTS APPROVAL‚Äù - contact technical support. <br><br>  <b>What will be checked?</b> <br><br>  <b>Phase 1.</b> Identity check <br><br><ul><li>  Are you who you say you are?  This step protects developers from impersonators, and gives customers a guarantee that they receive data from a trusted source. </li><li>  Is the subscriber affiliated with the company and authorized to publish the applications? </li><li>  Is the address provided (yours or company)? </li></ul><br>  <b>Phase 2.</b> Information audit <br><br><ul><li>  Check Marketing Profile </li><li>  Name / Company Name.  We check the uniqueness of the name </li><li>  Web site.  Checks if the site exists and if you own it. </li><li>  Company contacts.  We contact the company and check whether the working contact is provided. </li><li>  Microsoft Account.  If this account was used in other Microsoft stores, then by whom </li><li>  Logo.  Size, format, content </li></ul><br><br>  While you are waiting for the verification and approval of your application to create an account, you can fill out a financial profile. <br><br><h3>  Payments and taxes </h3><br><ol><li>  Select the tab ‚ÄúPayments and taxes‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/60f/3c7/c7f/60f3c7c7f9944c33b6ae2c5e95d8cd43.png"><br></li><li>  Choose a payment method.  If you have the opportunity to choose, for example, between a bank account and PayPal.  If not, accept what is </li><li>  Add billing information.  You need to know the SWIFT code of your bank (you can find it on the bank‚Äôs website, details, or ask your account manager, for example).  The name of the account holder will not add complexity, as you most likely know him well.  The IBAN number can be found in the statement of the account, for example, or on the Internet banking site.  You can find out by calling or visiting your bank.  Also, other requisites are needed (for Kazakhstan, for example, these are IIN and TIN) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0c8/f05/471/0c8f054712934fc6848f5bfe050b1872.png"><br></li><li>  Enter your billing address.  It's simple.  One caveat - use only Latin.  Cyrillic is not accepted. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/874/832/7e5/8748327e5d8744a5a3786d63039231d4.png"><br></li><li> After that, clicking the "Next" button, fill out the tax form and certificate of foreign origin (if you are not a US resident). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/023/8be/7e1/0238be7e16494e9e8f33ea28a38ef314.png"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1b3/ed9/e4c/1b3ed9e4c3a64a7cb190f93bbfcb81a1.png"><br></li><li>  If everything is filled in correctly, you can publish paid applications and receive money for them. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5d2/8e8/984/5d28e898422e4163a7e32a08f6605eb0.png"><br></li></ol><br>  Since the approval of the application for creating an account takes a long time, try to fill in all the fields in the application correctly so that you do not have to correct the comments and wait for approval again and again. <br><br>  <b>Comment.</b>  If you make changes to your account, the approval process starts from the beginning. <br><br><h3>  Step 3. Adding an application </h3><br><br>  Publishing an application is a fairly simple procedure.  After you have prepared it for publication in the Office Store, you will need to make several decisions. <br><br><ul><li>  Decide which languages ‚Äã‚Äãand markets you want to support.  Minimum - localized metadata in the Store.  Better is to localize the user interface.  Do not forget that adding languages ‚Äã‚Äãto an application imposes an obligation on you to support users using this language. </li><li>  Decide on the price of the application.  The available options are free of charge, pay per user (one-time or monthly subscription) or simply a paid version with the possibility of trial use.  SharePoint and email applications offer additional options.  Parameters of trial versions are completely determined by the developer. </li></ul><br>  Something worth preparing before you start publishing. <br><br><ul><li>  Formulations for all text entries <br><ul><li>  The title of the application, Title, Short and Long Description, everything is localized as needed. </li></ul><br></li><li>  Valid Metadata <br><ul><li>  Application Version Number, Release Date, 1-3 Categories in which the application will be visible in the Store </li></ul><br></li><li>  Correct application logo and 1-5 screenshots </li><li>  Notes for testers so that they can correctly test your application (not for the public, of course) <br><ul><li>  Include valid user data, links and instructions. </li></ul><br></li><li>  Links to your documentation and Privacy Policy </li><li>  Optional: links to the demo video and custom End-User License Agreement </li></ul><br>  Let's look at the process of publishing the application, so to speak, in pictures. <br><br><ol><li>  Go to the Dashboard and click "Add a new application" <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/90a/028/3a4/90a0283a46944165990af6b47f7e46ee.png"><br></li><li>  Select application type.  If this is your first time creating an application or add-in of a specific type for the Store, the Agreement will appear.  In the ‚ÄúMarket Conditions‚Äù section, read the agreement and, if you agree, check the box and click NEXT or Cancel. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/94b/41c/6f1/94b41c6f1fcf4614ba8a8b9fcbd3cfd2.png"><br></li><li>  On the overview page, do the following: <br><ol><li>  In the general information section, specify information such as Application name, version, and release date, depending on the type of application or add-in.  For SharePoint add-ons, the number specified in the <b>Version</b> field must fully match the version number in the sent manifest file.  The value in the <b>Release Date</b> field is the date that will be displayed as the release date of the application or add-in.  If you send an update and choose a date in the future, your application or add-in will not show up in the Office Store until the date is selected.  If your application or add-on was available in the Office Store, they will be hidden from users until the release date of the updated version. </li><li>  Please select at least one category.  You can choose up to three categories that will help customers find your add-in by filtering the list in the Office Store.  If you have selected the category ‚ÄúEducation‚Äù for an application or add-in, you must comply with policy 7.17 of <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/RU-RU/library/office/jj220035.aspx">verification policies</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/290/72a/b52/29072ab52fb4438f9f366babaa587c22.png"><br></li><li>  In the <b>logo</b> section, select the tile Logo Application and send the logo file.  In Office add-ins, only one logo is associated with the add-in.  If it needs to be localized, localized add-ons will need to be sent separately with logos in each language. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/41c/170/60e/41c17060ea10402bb1d0bba2a207b9e3.png"><br></li><li>  Depending on the type of sending, do one of the following actions: <br><ol><li>  for Office Add-in, in the <b>Application Package</b> section <b>,</b> select the Application Package tile and send the manifest file for the add-in; </li><li>  for the SharePoint Add-in, in the <b>Application Package</b> section <b>,</b> select the Application Package tile and send the add-in. </li></ol><br></li><li>  In the Testing Notes section, enter directions and links to resources or videos that show an application or add-on that will help testers validate your application.  For example, you can provide valid credentials or a password, if necessary.  The credentials and passwords are not intended for general use and will be used only by Microsoft.  Your data in the Testing Notes section are for approval only and will not be published in the store list.  If you provide detailed Testing Notes, they can help in approving the application.  For web applications, in testing notes, provide a single sign-on URL to help the tester find the application. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f3b/61d/712/f3b61d712c384053ae9b1818c94d7352.png"></li><li>  If an application or add-on calls, supports, contains, or uses cryptography or encryption, select the checkbox that the <b>application calls, supports, contains, or uses cryptography or encryption</b> .  Check the details and select Yes or No. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e2a/061/f7a/e2a061f7abdf465ca4bf78a81d255673.png"><br><br>  For more information about encryption, see <a href="https://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/policy-guidance/encryption">EAR Controls for Elements Using Encryption</a> . <br></li><li>  If the add-on is compatible with iOS, select the <b>Include this add-in</b> checkbox <b>in the Office for iPad add-ons</b> box.  In the Apple ID field, enter your Apple Developer ID. <br><br>  IOS-compatible add-ins must meet additional verification requirements.

Include http: // or in the URL.  Additionally, you can provide a link to the privacy document, a link to the video, and a modified end user license agreement.  If you do not change the license agreement, the store will provide it for you. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7e4/b0a/a55/7e4b0aa55c5048c2892c48251505f86d.png"></li></ol><br></li><li>  Click <b>Next, SAVE AS A DRAFT</b> or <b>CANCEL</b> </li><li>  On the next page, <b>Details</b> , you must select the language settings. <br><ol><li>  In the <b>Language Selection</b> drop-down list <b>,</b> select the language that the application or add-in supports, and click <b>CONFIRM</b> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6b2/32b/388/6b232b388354449f9f34cc764fdb725a.png"></li><li>  In the <b>description</b> section, specify the <b>add-in</b> name <b>, a brief description</b> and a <b>detailed description</b> in the appropriate language.
