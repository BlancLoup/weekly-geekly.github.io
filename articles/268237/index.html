The value of simplicity and flexibility of the network architecture is increasing, but availability remains the primary parameter.  Corporate customers should appreciate the different approaches of suppliers and different architectures, paying special attention to the opportunities associated with the software. <br><br><h4>  Market definition / Description </h4><br>  Network technologies for data centers provide a logical and / or physical network connection between corporate data centers.  Requirements for the data center network began to grow rapidly after a period of architectural stability that lasted more than 15 years.  While speed, density, and scale increased during this period, the basic architecture relied on an aging three-level hierarchical approach.

      <i>Under the cut analyst Gartner major players in the data center market</i> <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  New style of Internet-based IT, which works in large-scale organizations, such as Google, Facebook and Amazon, has changed the paradigm of IT services.  Advanced and enterprise-class mainstream organizations are currently trying to achieve improved flexibility, improved management, and / or reduced costs for their modules. <br><br>  The impact and lessons from the deployment of cloud systems in large-scale enterprises had serious implications for the enterprise-class data center networking market, focusing on which enterprises and much smaller ones can gain a lot of useful experience in setting up their networks.  Thus, the data center network technology market is undergoing a transformation process thanks to new architectures, technologies and products, which, in particular, are aimed at solving the following tasks: <br><br><ul><li>  Improve and simplify network operations to better match business goals and greater data center flexibility by using new, promising APIs, increasing programming capabilities and network automation; </li><li>  Consider changes in size and density in data centers; </li><li>  Take into account changes in the traffic pattern of applications; </li><li>  Provide solutions that are open and standardized to increase interoperability, stimulate innovation and reduce vendor-specific binding. </li></ul><br>  The underlying building blocks of the data center network include hardware and software that can be acquired together or independently from each other. <br><br><h4>  Hardware </h4><br>  The considered hardware includes network switches to which servers and other infrastructure elements are connected.  With the exception of VMware, all manufacturers covered by this research sell hardware switches.  We are currently observing that most new data centers require access to a 10 Gbps Ethernet (GbE) server and 40GbE backbone for normal operation.  In addition to the most large-scale data centers, we have not yet discovered significant demand for access to the server on a 25GbE, 40GbE or 50GbE or 100GbE backbone.  In addition, there are new interfaces on 25GbE and 50GbE, but in general, the demand for them has not yet formed.  The main type of physical network topology for most typical data centers includes a one- or two-tier leaf / trunk switching architecture and is produced as a ready-made Ethernet fiber.  In addition, most switch manufacturers are currently using industrial silicon in their hardware kits.  Thus, although the difference in hardware still exists, the main differentiation shifts towards software. <br><br><h4>  Software </h4><br>  All manufacturers covered by this study produce software for data centers of various levels.  Traditional software for data center networks was combined with (a) hardware and (b) an administrative (i.e., operational) interface.  Although this traditional approach to data center networks is still widely used to this day, software is at the center of transformational change.  New technologies (such as software-defined networks or SDN, downscaling via Ethernet fibers and switching) allow the development of software-defined traffic routing solutions independently and / or separately from the hardware and working interfaces. <br><br>  Regardless of whether traditional or modern approaches are used, the key software components of a typical corporate data center network include: <br><br><ul><li>  switch operating system (OS): operating system software that runs on individual physical network switches; </li><li>  virtual switch: virtual switching software that runs on physical servers running hypervisors and virtual machines; </li><li>  management software: network management software used to manage network infrastructure; </li><li>  controller: centralized software that implements the level of control and policy management that can be accessed programmatically through external systems. </li></ul><br>  On any data center network, at least one of these components is required, but not necessarily all.  For example, in some non-virtualized data center, virtual switches are not needed.  In addition, these components can be purchased together (from one supplier) or separately.  This creates a certain dynamic in the market, where suppliers covered by this research may be both competitors and partners depending on the network operation option. <br><br><h4>  What changed? </h4><br><h4>  Supplier Acquisitions </h4><br>  Two notable acquisitions occurred during 2014. First, Lenovo acquired a portfolio of x86 server and IBM data center switching.  Secondly, China Huaxin acquired a controlling stake of 85% of the investment in ALE corporate business (formerly Alcatel-Lucent Enterprise). <br><br><h4>  Software differences </h4><br>  Over the past 12 months, manufacturers continue to use industrial silicon based designs in their designs for switches.  But in addition there is a tangible strategy towards SDN.  Thus, the distinction between manufacturers' solutions continues to shift toward software (including management, resource allocation, automation, and orchestration), with increasingly standardized hardware capabilities (for example, bandwidth, power, and scalability). <br><br>  In the past 18 months, according to Gartner polls, customers for the data center often refer to the concepts of virtualization, management, and orchestration than ‚Äúspeeds, channels, and protocols,‚Äù which have dominated for many years. <br><br><h4>  SDN is becoming more and more interesting. </h4><br>  Many of the providers included in this ‚Äúmagic quadrant‚Äù have achieved significant success in implementing their network strategies (SDN).  From the user's point of view, 2014 was the year of the beginning of the careful testing of SDN as a mainstream market article as the market went beyond its ‚Äúarchitecture‚Äù, as it was generally defined in 2013.  SDN demand doubled or tripled in 2014, mainly due to customers trying to try SDN solutions.  Interest in these SDN technologies is currently shown by both type A and type B customers (see note 1), who often refer to the following incentives that motivated them to try SDN and related technologies: <br><br><ul><li>  the fastest system to work; </li><li>  increased security level; </li><li>  expanded range of management tools; </li><li>  Reduced network hardware / software costs </li><li>  lower operating costs; </li><li>  decrease dependence on one supplier; </li><li>  caution for long-term investments without SDN. </li></ul><br>  Gartner estimates that there are currently approximately 1,000 enterprise-level data centers that implement SDN mainstream solutions, which is about three times more than a year ago.  In the past year alone, Gartner has received more than 250 requests on SDN, including more than 50 in respect of comparisons between VMware NSX and Cisco ACI. <br><br><h4>  SDN overlays </h4><br>  Some manufacturers included in this Magic Quadrant provide the ability to overlay networks by creating virtual networks over a physical network.  Such solutions, as a rule, combine the capabilities of network and computing resources to provide a more flexible infrastructure.  Although this in itself is important enough, it is equally important to consider how the various overlay methods are implemented.  The overlay is still completely dependent on the substrate physical network, and the issues of network control and visibility are crucial to ensure the overlay reliability.  There are prospects for improving the coordination of overlaying SDN with the physical network.  This creates an interesting dynamic in the market, because overlay manufacturers can again act as partners and competitors to traditional suppliers of network switches. <br><br><h4>  Disaggregated switches ("white boxes") </h4><br>  Interest in disaggregated switches and their use has increased significantly in large-scale data centers over the past few quarters.  Disaggregated switches are versatile, ready-to-use platforms supplied by manufacturers of original designs (ODM).  Buyers of the ‚Äúwhite box‚Äù should acquire and integrate their own version of the network software for these platforms.  Switches of this type currently account for more than 5% of all data center ports sold, and there are increasing market growth rates.  Inspired by large-scale structures, an increasing number of Type A organizations are showing interest in disaggregated switches. <br><br>  This led to the emergence of a new style of switches, which Gartner calls branded white boxes or ‚ÄúBright Boxes‚Äù (Brand + White = Brite Box).  In switches of this type, hardware is disaggregated from software, but measures have been taken against some of the shortcomings of a ‚Äúclean‚Äù disaggregated switch, for example, in the areas of acquisition, integration, and support.  The environment for this style of switches is just beginning to emerge.  For example: <br><br>  - Dell supports operating network operating systems from Cumulus Networks and Big Switch Networks on its hardware; <br>  - Juniper Networks supports "bright boxes" based on disaggregated switches that run on an optimized version of Junos software; <br>  - HP recently announced the release of a Bright Box solution with white-box hardware and Cumulus software; <br>  - New suppliers, such as Big Switch and Pica8, offer operating systems for switches that can be run on top of disaggregated switches; <br>  - Facebook project called Facebook Open Compute Project (OCP) Wedge offers a reference platform for self-development of commercial solutions. <br><br>  Many other examples of these business models and partnership options for commercial access are expected to emerge over the next 12 months. <br><br><h4>  Open networks </h4><br>  Vendors supporting a more open approach to SDN responded to the market call by increasing support for OpenDaylight (ALC) as their platform.  While almost all the manufacturers in this study are members of the OpenDaylight consortium, more importantly, many of them have released flagship SDN products based on OpenDaylight code, including Avaya, Brocade and Extreme Networks.  Broad support for OpenDaylight makes it possible for a third medium to emerge on the SDN market, which will stimulate new innovations, the development of features and operating environments (the current market position and influence in the data center industry will allow Cisco and VMware to install more closed environments). <br><br><h4>  Converged Infrastructure / Integrated Systems </h4><br>  While most SDN-based solutions offer a wide range of disaggregation options, we observe the opposite in one market segment, and this current is characterized by the offer of integrated systems.  Where the task is to streamline operations and optimize setup times, converged infrastructures are gaining popularity.  Last year, converged infrastructures accounted for 7% of the data center infrastructure market (which includes the network, servers, storage systems and related management components), with an annual growth of 57%.  The implications of these technologies are that they are largely strictly spelled out, which leads to the transfer of the physical access level of the purchased network from the exclusively network version to the server / storage system / network option.  Examples of these systems are reference integrated architectures from the VCE Vblock and NetApp FlexPod and integrated systems from Dell, HP and Lenovo, as well as new solutions from vendors such as Nutanix and SimpliVity. <br><br><h4>  What is required of network technologies for new data centers? </h4><br>  Above was described the environment that has undergone significant changes and giving the opportunity to enter the market with a variety of more energetic and efficient networking technology offers. <br><br>  Many of the vendors reviewed in this study provide solutions that are ‚Äúgood enough‚Äù to meet current current requirements for data center networks.  However, there are enough differences between suppliers, including cost, architecture, and how suppliers decide to meet new and future requirements.  Looking at the future, modern data center network solutions should meet the following requirements: <br><br>  - The need for simplified and automated network architectures; <br>  - Increased network flexibility; <br>  - Change the size and density of the data center network; <br>  - Change application architecture <br>  - Innovation and diversity of options; <br>  - Migration of intellectual capital and its protection; <br><br><h4>  Simplified Networks with Greater Flexibility </h4><br>  Data center networks must meet growing business needs for faster, service-oriented execution of IT tasks.  This is due to the current business requirements and the availability of more flexible options within and outside the traditional corporate IT.  These options (often made on the basis of virtual and cloud platforms) revealed non-optimal paradigms of network operations (including static and manual configuration and configuration procedures), which increase service delivery time, reduce network accessibility, increase operating costs and significantly hinder operational scaling environment. <br><br><h4>  Resizing and density </h4><br>  The size and density of data centers are changing, and there are several main trends that encourage both the consolidation and the reduction of data center: <br><br>  - Server and data center consolidation requires IT organizations to centralize computing resources and reduce the number of physical data centers, resulting in fewer, but larger, corporate data centers. <br>  - Increasing computation density using multisocket multi-core servers, combined with virtualization and storage convergence, is a reduction in physical footprint required.  The loads that are used to capture multiple racks with servers are currently delivered in parts of the same rack. <br>  - Migrating applications to external cloud services also reduces space requirements within the corporate data center. <br><br><h4>  Change application architecture </h4><br>  Typical enterprise-level applications, which are now the most common, are increasingly independent of specific servers and allow for multiple deployment options.  In addition, new applications, such as big data management systems, have stricter bandwidth requirements, latency and interface buffers than traditional applications.  As a result, there is a growing need to effectively manage the traffic within the data center ("east-west") has recently led to the emergence of several innovations: <br><br>  - High-performance, low-latency top-of-rack switches (ToR); <br>  - The emergence of one- or two-tier physical switching architecture; <br>  - The growing use of central switches with a fixed form factor; <br>  - A higher level of traffic forwarding and better intelligent software at the server access level (using virtual chassis or cluster system chassis). <br><br>  These approaches increase server-to-server performance and allow developing data center network technologies in the direction of a homogeneous set of capabilities for all connected computing resources. <br><br><h4>  Long-term innovations and options </h4><br>  Disaggregation, SDN and open networks provide the opportunity for transformational changes in the market for network solutions.  Decoupling hardware and software and decoupling management and data levels represent the potential for fundamental improvement in network design, acquisition, management, and deployment.  These improvements allow the launch of extraneous applications on new network solutions with the potential to significantly expand their spectrum in the long-term innovation perspective.  This innovation ‚Äî combined with open network, disaggregation, and / or SDN ‚Äî is clearly a destructive market trend for all that has traditionally been viewed as a deeply integrated, hardware-oriented model. <br><br><h4>  Transfer and protection of information capital </h4><br>  Given that new technologies and business models are critically important, manufacturers should also be concerned about the provision of information security tools for existing data and their planned migration of migration from currently deployed architectures to new ones. <br><br>  <b>Magic quadrant</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8b7/446/0d5/8b74460d568e11fe1c56b314e1740468.png" alt="image"><br>  <i>Figure 1. The Magic Quadrant for Data Center Networks</i> <br><br><h4>  <b>Strengths and weaknesses and suppliers</b> </h4><br><br>  <b>Arista Networks</b> <br><br>  Arista, today, is one of the fastest growing manufacturers noted in this Magic Quadrant.  Now it is firmly in third place in the ranking of data center networks, given the market share of income interest shown by Gartner customers.  Arista delivers a closed physical network solution that can be integrated into any network architecture of the data center.  Arista provides a simple product architecture that scales from small to very large data centers.  The vendor invested in its EOS (Extensible Operating System) software to create lightweight network and application deployment functions.  Arista is in the process of expanding her target client base from the level of early, technically prudent buyers to the level of enterprises of a wider range of conformists, and geographically expands beyond North America and Europe.  Arista is traditionally the leader in price / performance of the data center network, but the growth in the use of silicon-based switches and the aggressive pricing policy of competitors are rapidly closing the gap.  Organizations should consider Arista's proposals for any data center, provided that the supplier has regional certification and provides engineering support for the solutions in question. <br><br>  <i>Strengths</i> <br><br>  - Arista provides deep integration of its products with a variety of software and SDN orchestration solutions, which gives customers the freedom to choose without shorting to any one architecture. <br>  - Arista has built a flexible software environment (Arista EOS) with powerful features that include network telemetry and application visibility capabilities along with extensible APIs. <br>  - Arista offers solutions that are optimally configured for the environment and that take advantage of the various Arista form factors that help create a more efficient and often cost-effective structure. <br>  - Arista offers high-performance solutions with deep buffering and low latency, which allows you to cope with the complexities of modern data center applications. <br><br>  <i>Weak sides</i> <br><br>  - Geographical coverage is still small in Asia, in the Pacific region and in the markets of developing countries compared to more established sellers, and while Arista is only increasing its internal technological and channel programs to better meet the needs of the main market. <br>  - Arista does not support converged storage systems and data networks, for which FC (or FCoE) is a mandatory requirement. <br>  ‚ÄúAlthough the Arista network solution is a very flexible and reliable network foundation, organizations that need dynamic orchestration systems will need to integrate it into an external orchestration system. <br>  - The latest legal issues with Cisco demonstrate an increased perceived risk level for some potential customers.  Organizations should assign their legal departments to assess the risk associated with this issue (see note 2). <br><br>  <b>Avaya</b> <br><br>  Avaya is one of the smallest players in this magic quadrant, based on current revenue estimates (currently less than 1% of data center revenue), although it still has a large, stable base of traditional solutions.  Avaya's current solution ‚Äî based on its Fabric Connect architecture ‚Äî is a highly automated solution that provides easy extensibility inside and between data centers for the mobility of a simplified virtual machine (VM) and optimized east-west traffic flows.  Until very recently, Avaya data center solutions lacked significant investments to enter the market (in sales, system engineering, and marketing), which significantly limited its ability to play in the market and held back growth.  Sales promotion and support for engineering teams should improve Avaya's capabilities in 2015 Considering Avaya offers (after confirming local support) makes sense if the priority is to simplify the configuration. <br><br>  <i>Strengths</i> <br><br>  - Avaya offers a highly automated solution that contains high-performance multicast operations that are less demanding on configuration and administrator intervention than competing solutions. <br>  ‚ÄúBased on customer feedback and end-user survey results, Avaya is consistently rated above average in how its relevant budget solutions meet customer expectations and requirements. <br>  - Avaya has proven itself in supplying high-availability data center network architectures. <br>  - Avaya's Fabric Connect solution provides smooth expansion between data centers and from headquarters to branch offices, giving a simplified solution to a corporate network. <br><br>  <i>Weak sides</i> <br><br>  ‚ÄúAvaya is currently one of the smallest vendors in this magic quadrant for data center revenue and has a limited (albeit growing) amount of resources allocated for network technologies. <br>  - Supplier channels may be insufficient, therefore enterprises should have their own qualified resources to support new implementations. <br>  - Avaya is late in launching SDN-based products, entering the 1H15 market with SDN Fx architecture. <br>  - Avaya's automated data center structure is based on the Shortest Path Bridging (SPB) protocol, which other vendors have poorly represented.  This can lead to integration problems in environments from different vendors. <br><br>  <b>Brocade</b> <br><br>  Brocade's data center network solution is based on its VCS automated structure technology and Vyatta SDN controllers.  Brocade has a long and rich history of data center vendor thanks to its market leading SAN solutions.  The company is a leader in converged networks and data storage.  Its VCS structural architecture, supported by a set of VDX switches, provides a high level of embedded structure automation and can be combined with a high level of routing for connecting data centers and external resources.  Brocade is the lead initiator of OpenDaylight SDN and a prominent supporter of the open SDN environment.  Consider Brocade when you need an automated network data center structure. <br><br>  <i>Strengths</i> <br><br>  - The supplier provides an automated structure with a configuration that does not require special configuration ("zero-touch"), the purpose of which is to assist in the initial deployment and expansion of the structure. <br>  - Brocade is the main protagonist in ODL and increases investment and innovation in the SDL controller software based on the ODL Vyatta, and also has a number of software options for network function virtualization (NFV), helping to develop an open SDN environment. <br>  - Brocade offers a subscription-based purchase option, which may be useful for a business case for new investments and provides an opportunity to switch to a new technology without capital costs. <br>  - Brocade provides robust integration with OpenStack and VMware (vCenter, vRealize and NSX), including the hardware bridge for NSX-MH. <br><br>  <i>Weak sides</i> <br><br>  - Gartner respondents report that Brocade solutions are among the most expensive offers compared to competitive peers.  However, recent additions to the VDx portfolio should allow Brocade to offer with more competitive pricing options. <br>  - Brocade service channels are not well established or not wide enough compared to a significant number of leading competitors. <br>  - Brocade does not offer its own converged data center infrastructures.  However, its technologies are integrated into other convergent solutions, such as the EMC VSPEX and VSPEX Blue, Hitachi Unified Compute Platform (embedded and ToR) and the Fujitsu vShape. <br>  - According to customer survey data and survey results, there are problems with the quality of the code. <br><br>  <b>Cisco</b> <br><br>  Cisco among corporate networking professionals has long been considered a ‚Äúsafe choice‚Äù and remains the leader in the global market by a wide margin, judging by turnover and revenue.  Cisco is now being seriously tested, trying to maintain its large fleet of installed equipment, while maintaining the pace in a rapidly changing market.  Cisco has a deep and wide range of solutions that can meet all requirements for data center networks, ranging from small or medium-sized organizations (SMB) to large enterprises and providers.  However, there are some overlaps, contradictions in the construction of architectures.  Gartner respondents complained about confusing options that could lead to the selection of an inappropriate product.  Last year, Cisco continued to promote its flagship solution for data center networks, and now it supplies software and hardware for Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI).  ACI is a programmable Ethernet framework that supports a centralized, policy-based model as an alternative to the traditional, device-centric, command-line interface (CLI) approach.  Cisco should be considered for any data center networking globally. <br><br>  <i>Strengths</i> <br><br>  - Cisco has the largest stable base compared to any supplier in this Magic Quadrant.  There will always be a large number of specialists in the enterprise who are well acquainted with its products and solutions. <br>  - Cisco networking products are built into several integrated system offerings, including VCE Vblock, NetApp FlexPod and IBM VersaStack, with which organizations can quickly build infrastructure. <br>  - Cisco offers several products with which organizations can integrate logical and physical infrastructure: vSwitches, supported by VMware, Microsoft, Xen, KVM, and Linux container Linux, as well as blade switches that can be used by Dell, Lenovo, and the blade chassis HP <br>  ‚ÄúIn addition to networking technologies, Cisco provides solutions for computing, network security, storage, and security, and unified communications (UC) solutions that are suitable for customers who do not want to buy from disparate vendors. <br><br>  <i>Weak sides</i> <br><br>  ‚ÄúBased on respondent feedback and contract research, Gartner considers Cisco solutions to be one of the most expensive on the market, even when compared to competitive offers.  In addition, Cisco and its distributors often encounter technically advanced solutions. <br>  - Cisco has a history of creating products that are based on closed and / or proprietary elements, which leads to dependence on a single supplier. <br>  - The Cisco ACI platform provides limited data protection for the existing fleet of installed equipment on Nexus and Catalyst equipment or for the Cisco UCS server architecture.  Currently, there is a shortage of features, such as support for FCoE and external data center interconnections used by many organizations. <br>  ‚ÄúAlthough Cisco ACI can now be purchased everywhere, there is a very limited acceptance of this product on the market: fewer than 25 industrial ACI installations at large-scale enterprises by the end of March 2015. Corporate customers continue to report that Cisco is struggling to commission an industrial-level ACI. <br><br>  <b>Dell</b> <br><br>  In the area of ‚Äã‚Äãnetwork technologies, the data center Dell is one of the main four players in terms of supply, and its revenue over the past year had grown above the market average.  There are currently more than 24,000 Dell Networking customers.  The supplier offers a solid range of fixed, chassis and blade switches that meet the needs of most enterprises.  Dell focuses primarily on customers with servers or Dell computers and has a strong position in the mid-market.  At the end of 2013, Dell completed corporate privatization in order to achieve financial flexibility in transforming its operations.  Because of all this, Dell turns out to be the supplier with the most innovations and breakthroughs in data center networking technologies in the market over the past 12 months.  In January 2014, Dell announced support for a fundamentally new switching paradigm (disaggregation), which allows organizations to run network software on networks with foreign OS on certain Dell hardware.  This caused excitement throughout the network industry and forced other manufacturers to consider and / or respond with similar competitive offers.  Organizations with an existing relationship with Dell may consider this supplier, as well as large organizations that need an open networking solution. <br><br>  <i>Strengths</i> <br><br>  - Dell has developed one of the most open, invariant and standardized approaches to meeting customer requirements for data center. <br>  ‚ÄúIn addition to networking technologies, Dell provides protocol controllers, computing and storage infrastructure, which is convenient for customers who prefer to buy infrastructure from a single vendor. <br>  - Dell has integrated its network components into integrated systems from Microsoft and (Microsoft Cloud Platform Solution [MCPS]) and VMware (EVO), which is beneficial for customers who prefer fast infrastructure deployment. <br>  ‚ÄúDell is the No. 3 supplier in the 40GbE port industry after Cisco and Arista Networks, and this is a key requirement for high performance data centers. <br><br>  <i>Weak sides</i> <br><br>  - Gartner respondents report stability issues with Dell networking software in some selected use cases. <br>  ‚ÄúThe supplier has a limited outlook beyond Dell‚Äôs current affairs and is therefore rarely mentioned in customer lists for environments that do not use other Dell products. <br>  - Despite the presence of many innovations, the support of detailed switching models for Dell is still new, and according to Gartner estimates, there are less than 100 of those for March 2015, if we talk about the level of manufacturing enterprises. <br>  ‚ÄúDell traditionally delivers products in a direct sales model, so it has underdeveloped distribution channels compared to other suppliers.  When working with Dell partners, you should make inquiries before making a deal and make sure that they have several implementations of the appropriate scale. <br><br>  <b>Extreme Networks</b> <br><br>  Extreme has completed the assimilation of Enterasys Networks and now has a total of more than 14,000 corporate clients.  In the data center industry, Extreme remains AMONG smaller suppliers, covering about 2% of the market (as measured by income or turnover), and it is not often found in the list of competitive alternatives that are considered by respondents.  In the year that has passed since the acquisition of Enterasys, the company focused on streamlining its product range, updating distribution channels and partner programs in order to improve support for customers interested in data center networking technologies.  In addition, this company has released several new hardware switches and its SDN controller, an enhanced version of OpenDaylight.  Extreme products are worth considering for businesses in North and South America and Europe that want to deal with one specialized provider of network data center solutions. <br><br>  <i>Strengths</i> <br><br>  - Gartner respondents praise a very strong level of customer service, which is also confirmed in research surveys. <br>  - Extreme has a deep and wide range of network equipment for data centers with a more than 15-year history of supplying high-performance and reliable network solutions. <br>  - Extreme leads an aggressive pricing policy on competitive terms. <br>  - Extreme has an open and high-standard approach to meeting new requirements for data center networks, which includes extensive OpenFlow support, an OpenDaylight-based SDN controller and support for several APIs, including the Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF). <br><br>  <i>Weak sides</i> <br><br>  - Extreme is one of the smallest sellers among those covered in this study and is growing at a rate lower than the market average.  Thus, when buying, organizations must ensure that there is a sales and service structure at the local level. <br>  - At one time, Extreme‚Äôs cooperation with Lenovo in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãintegrated systems seemed promising.  Now this project is in question due to Lenovo‚Äôs acquisition of IBM‚Äôs network solutions portfolio.  Before choosing any joint project Extreme / Lenovo should carefully examine their joint plans for further cooperation. <br>  - For those who are looking for a converged network solution for a storage server, Extreme is not suitable, because it focuses on networks in its developments. <br>  ‚ÄúAlthough this vendor offers high-performance solutions that take into account the requirements of large-scale environments, the current Extreme offerings lack some of the capabilities that many large and‚Äú particularly advanced ‚Äùorganizations may need: integration with VMware NSX, support for Puppet and Chef. <br><br>  <b>HP</b> <br><br>  HP is the No. 2 player in the data center networking technology market; it has a global scale, although during 2014 its growth did not keep pace with the market growth rate.  HP has a wide range of fixed, chassis and blade switches to meet the needs of all corporate organizations.   ,  Gartner       ,      HP  .   - (6125XLG  Virtual Connect)        HP Networking   .
