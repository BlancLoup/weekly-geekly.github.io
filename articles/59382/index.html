To everyone's surprise, Thomas Nurstr√∂m never advertised his membership in such organizations even before he took on the TPB case. <br><br>  Together with several lawyers representing the film industry and record labels, the judge is a member of the Swedish Copyright Law Association (SFU) and the Swedish Association for the Protection of Industrial Law (SFIR).

      Being in these societies, Nurstr√∂m was automatically a member of the two largest organizations of pro-copyright law - ALAI and AIPPI, in the charters of which the main goal was defined - to satisfy the interests of the copyright holders.  Actually sentencing the administrators of the world's largest tracker to a year in prison and large amounts of fines, the judge unquestioningly fulfilled the obligations prescribed by the statute. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Initially, many representatives of the Swedish judicial system doubted whether Nurstr√∂m‚Äôs participation in national organizations for the protection of intellectual property was such a significant reason for a retrial.  According to <a href="http://www.dn.se/kultur-noje/musik/nya-javanklagelser-mot-the-pirate-bay-domaren-1.863092">Swedish Radio,</a> after the facts of his membership in ALAI and AIPPI surfaced, doubts disappeared by themselves.  Many insiders and experts wished to remain anonymous, but Eric Bylander, a professor of procedural law at the University of Gothenburg, said that "the credibility of the judicial system will return if the appellate court considers this as bias." <br><br><img align="left" src="http://pic.ipicture.ru/uploads/090512/3g4RfGTIL2.jpg">  In the case of a retrial, this will be a small one, but a victory for the defendants and a replay of the Spectrial with perhaps another ending.  Peter Sunde, one of the defendants found guilty by a biased judge, sincerely hopes for a retrial.  ‚ÄúIn the interests of Swedish justice, it is simply necessary to send the case for review if only to restore public confidence in an impartial court,‚Äù said Peter in an interview with TorrentFreak.  A request for a re-trial was filed and we will hear a decision on its adoption in a few weeks. <br><br>  In addition to replacing the obviously concerned judge, Peter and the company will demand a new police investigation.  The investigation on which the prosecution was based was led by Jim Kaiser, who was caught in connection with Warner Bros.  ‚ÄúWe want an investigation open to the eyes of the public in order to make sure of the accuracy of all the materials provided,‚Äù Peter Sunde writes in his blog. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/59382/">https://habr.com/ru/post/59382/</a></p>
