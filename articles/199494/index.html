  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Trackball. Say no to "tunnel syndrome"</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I met computers a long time ago.  In those days, when the "mouse" was something exotic, even among the few PC users.  For the era of Windows has not yet come, but otherwise calmly managed without it.  Even episodic launches of Windows 3.1 were experimental rather than working. <br><br>  But over time, this manipulator became more and more popular.  And already with the release in 1995, Windows 95 and absolutely indispensable.  The transition to a purely graphical environment led to the fact that the ‚Äúmouse‚Äù rarely left my hand. <br><br>  In those days, the Computer Press magazine was published (I don‚Äôt know if it was out now).  From it I learned, among other things, about the so-called ‚Äútunnel syndrome‚Äù.  When painful sensations appear in the wrists due to long use of the keyboard without a stand under the hands or ‚Äúmouse‚Äù.  The cause of the disease is a compression of the median nerve between the bones and the tendons of the muscles of the wrist.  However, Vicky claims that a direct link between computer scientists with a similar syndrome and the nature of their activity has not yet been established, since  ordinary people are also subject to this misfortune.  And so my right wrist got sore.  Who cares - welcome under cat. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In general, one way or another, but it became a pain in my right wrist.  About a year since 2002. At first, a little, then more and more reminded of themselves.  Sometimes it was necessary to wrap the wrist with an elastic bandage in order to fix the joint and relieve pain.  Different pads on the brush of the type of varying degrees of elasticity of the silicone pads on the mouse pads were not particularly useful, since  when moving the mouse, the wrist is still somehow involved.

      The need to do something in the situation was growing.  Sore wrist.  And not that straight cut, and so whining disgusting.  Like a mosquito at night - like a trifle, but so nasty.  The need to ensure the peace of the hand was becoming more and more obvious.  And then I decided to try the trackball. <br><br>  For those who do not know, a trackball is an inverted ‚Äúmouse‚Äù (remember, were there mice with balls?).  In ordinary ‚Äúmice‚Äù, you control the cursor on the screen by moving the ‚Äúmouse‚Äù on the table.  The movements twist the ball (I‚Äôm so old-school), the ball turns the wheels with the slits, to the light that passes through the slits, the sensor responds and the cursor moves on the screen.  In the trackball, the device itself is in place.  You move the ball, performing with your finger the role of the table, on which the mouse moves. <br><br>  The year was 2006.  After reading the reviews and viewing the models, I encountered two unexpected moments: <br>  1. The trackball turned out to be expensive. <br>  2. In our stores, their choice is extremely limited.  Now, I think, the range has become even poorer. <br><br>  In those years, ordering something via the Internet was not very much accepted, and not particularly accessible due to the low prevalence of plastic cards.  Therefore, choosing from what I could reach.  From the trackball, I needed two basic parameters: <br>  1. The presence of "wheel" <br>  2. Large size to fit in the palm (yes, yes, I also thought that the ideal when placed in the palm also applies to trackballs) <br><br>  As the study of the available trackball models showed, not all of them have such obvious on the "mouse" wheel for vertical scrolling.  Surprisingly, it is.  Two keys, a ball to move the cursor and all.  Extremely awkward solutions for everyday life.  The various wheel emulation options did not appeal to me.  Moreover, even though the range of models was limited, it was all the same. <br><br>  And the size that the palm lay decided the question of finding the hand in a state of maximum rest.  With this size, the movement of the brush is minimal.  You just touch with your index and nameless fingers and twist the ball to move the cursor with your thumb.  No more movement in the hand. <br><br>  And be sure to wired.  I don‚Äôt know why, but somehow I don‚Äôt add up with wireless input devices.  Then the charge suddenly ends, the connection starts to get lost and the cursor jumps on the screen with jerks.  In general, it did not work out with us. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5d2/f7e/d33/5d2f7ed337d2b9f87a667efdfe7d500b.png" alt="image"><br>  After trying out the requirements for what was available at the time in the stores, the choice would have been stopped on Logitech TrackMan Whell.  Which was successfully acquired in the same 2006.  Usually they say "miracle did not happen."  But in my case, that is exactly what happened.  First, the pain went away from the wrist.  About two to three months and pain no longer manifest.  Secondly, the trackball turned out to be a very versatile thing.  I'm not a professional gamer, but sometimes I like to shoot a couple of reptiles.  Surprisingly, even in Counter Strike type shooters, the trackball turned out to be quite in demand.  Well, the most interesting thing is that this device from Logitech is also very tenacious.  Until now he is working quite successfully.  Those.  for almost 8 years.  It is only necessary to periodically remove the ball and clean the pimples (I don‚Äôt know how to call them differently) by which the ball slides inside its hole.  Once a couple of years I clean the lens. <br><br>  Well, in conclusion, a small result: my many years of experience using the trackball showed that this is a very good choice.  When choosing a device, you should pay attention to its convenience for placement in the hand and the availability of the necessary buttons-wheels for your tasks.  Who needs positioning accuracy, you should pay attention to such a parameter as DPI.  Personally, I am completely satisfied with what TrackMan has.  But I heard complaints that there is not enough for players. <br><br>  And the trackball has a huge plus in saving working space.  Since  You no longer need to move the paddle around the table. The problem of the suddenly ended desk no longer exists for you. <br><br>  And the most important thing: if you work more than one, then keep a regular ‚Äúmouse‚Äù for colleagues.  To look at how a person with unaccustomed behavior will struggle with the accumulated motor skills and try to move the trackball around the table, albeit funny, but, from experience, I will say that‚Äôs all.  The man who picked up the trackball for the first time looks extremely helpless.  Therefore, if your colleagues sometimes have to take control of you, give them what they are used to working with.  And feel the power passing through the Universe and causing a slight tingling in your fingers.  After all, you know how to master both themes and topics equally masterly. <br><br>  Good luck. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/199494/">https://habr.com/ru/post/199494/</a></p>
