In the world of .NET heroes are not like that.  In the .NET world, a hero is a rebel in a tie.  Because there is no zoo platform.  MS releases the tool and it works.  Almost everything vendor, albeit cross-platform.  The bundle with the OS is good, so there is not even a GC zoo.  There are several profilers, but they lie much less.  There is no problem of choosing among a million tools. <br><br>  But the heroes are still there.  And it just so happened that our most hardcore speakers have rather strange hobbies besides the development itself. <br><br>  <b>The first guy who will powerfully push in is Jeffrey Richter.</b>  This is the one who wrote <a href="https://www.ozon.ru/context/detail/id/116668/">"Windows for professionals"</a> and <a href="https://www.ozon.ru/context/detail/id/7425674/">"CLR via C #"</a> .  If you code it, you know it a little, because without reading this book it‚Äôs impossible to pass a single .NET interview.  He works in MS, an architect in Azhur.  He has his own business yet.  Conducts video courses for senior's about how to properly, because he understands everything under the hood.

      In her free time, she breeds people (a member of the International Brotherhood of Magicians) and labs jazz on drums and keyboards. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  On this DotNext he will have two reports: one about generics - he is furiously versed in this topic and presents a device.  But I am sure that they will not go to him because of the topic, but because it is HE.  I already know that many are going to carry books for signature.  The second report he has more to do with what he is doing in Azhur (and he does very great big things).  Can talk about their experiences from the current about scalable applications.  There is space. <br><br>  ‚Üí That's about <a href="https://dotnext-moscow.ru/2018/msk/talks/3iim4evbnamakswec6ugsy/">his report</a> <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">A photo</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/-u/qr/eo/-uqreoeei6m1oaa-eee3pr5b098.jpeg"><br></div></div><br>  <b>Then Greg Young, who introduced the concept of CQRS.</b>  He is an independent dude, a consultant entrepreneur.  A lot of where kontbititit (including InfoQ).  Known on codebetter.com in CQRS and in promoting DDD.  He also organizes a Build Stuff conference - this is a big conference in Eastern Europe.  Famous guy in the community, very sociable, for movement and development.  Great coach.  He travels a lot.  It may seem that his hobby is just travel (and he has visited many places), but in fact he has been writing a book for a long time.  And still can not finish.  If you want - ask him about what it will be.  But it is better to travel, for aftepati he just will burn. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">A photo</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/9u/n_/42/9un_42r_t15azck1m9oxvwxmiha.jpeg"><br></div></div><br>  <b>Very interesting Dylan Beatty.</b>  He has come to our conferences for the fourth time.  Works SKT Skills Matter in London.  He tells about architectural things - not so much philosophical, but high-level, which allow programming correctly.  For example, how to make an API so that everything does not fall apart in six months.  How to make a system for 20 years, so that it does not die.  Most of the people in the IT world do this: ‚ÄúWe are throwing, it will work,‚Äù and then problems start to appear, and everything is frayed.  And this guy knows in advance what and how it will go.  He listens to the entire conference.  This time, he will talk about why not to throw out the good old Legacy code.  Hobby - music.  He always performs at parties, plays cool and sings.  We always do his live after-party concert.  He sings something like a mix of English and American hits, but converted into programmatic motifs.  And now the Russians.  Last time he sang "Leningrad" - "Summer Resident".  Will there be Gaza this year?  Nobody knows.  In addition, he is a very funny guy, positive, he is caught in the corridors to communicate, especially after he started learning Russian (after participating in DotNext, by the way!).  On the reports usually makes the whole show.  Here is his <a href="https://youtu.be/x1Eo0uECOoE">past performance</a> . <br><br>  He also organizes the largest .NET-conference NDC and is on the program committee.  There are many places where they are: in Australia, London, USA. <br><br>  ‚Üí That's about <a href="https://dotnext-moscow.ru/2018/msk/talks/3wyuyuhfbwks2aqa0ekccy/">his report</a> <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">A photo</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/2n/vm/0s/2nvm0siaas0nksedmg8ayxg8sqo.jpeg"><br></div></div><br>  <b>The most secretive hero of the conference is Pavel Iosifovich.</b>  He has written several books, in particular ‚Äú <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Windows-Internals-Part-architecture-management/dp/0735684189">Windows Internals, Part 1</a> ‚Äù and ‚Äú <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Windows-Presentation-Foundation-4-5-Cookbook/dp/184968622X">WPF4 Cookbook</a> ‚Äù.  Coach-author-speaker with MS-platform.  Very few people know his name and surname.  But his first book is just super.  And not everyone read it, but they know that this is a tin of some kind of hardcore low level.  At the speech, he will also talk about the low level.  There are few community activities from him, because he loves to create in darkness. <br><br>  ‚Üí That's about <a href="https://dotnext-moscow.ru/2018/msk/talks/4trvunckj2mcwo0cyciicu/">his report</a> <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">A photo</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/3y/xe/6m/3yxe6mmz08qpjvxq9delfxnufme.jpeg"><br></div></div><br>  <b>Konrad Kokosa</b> is the author of a book about .NET Memory Management ( <a href="https://prodotnetmemory.com/">it has already been announced and will be released in early December</a> ).  The book even before the release became Amazon's bestseller for pre-orders in a number of categories.  He is furious about the Garbage Collectors device - 800 fascinating pages there are just about that.  He is also the organizer of <a href="https://dotnetos.org/">dotnetos</a> in Warsaw.  He is very active in motion, likes to communicate with people.  At least from MS, but it still makes a very funny conference: he travels all over the country with friends and lectures, sort of like in a rock tour.  As for the book, <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/maoni/2018/09/17/get-this-fantastic-book-about-net-memory-management/">it was recommended by Mayoni</a> (which was invented by a garbage collection collector).  That she praised someone - it does not happen very often, almost like a meteorite that destroyed dinosaurs.  Perhaps this is the most romantic declaration of love between the two professionals to each other, but we know that this is not so. <br><br>  ‚Üí That's about <a href="https://dotnext-moscow.ru/2018/msk/talks/3xgkkwsfwwoemyscmkwum2/">his report</a> <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">A photo</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/2k/zf/_t/2kzf_tbmnc4_mmordk78mvyletc.jpeg"><br></div></div><br>  <b>Alexandre Mutel</b> - one of the authors of SharpDX, Zio - knows a lot about Inter for .NET and DirectX.  Someone under the small-soft straight X did something, she knows very well.  He is the author of Markdig for parsing Marcown.  This is a piece that parses everything, and the performance is wildly pumped over.  A little masterpiece of optimization.  Now Alexandra works at Unity for toys.  There he is engaged in deep low-level, performance and, again, hardcore optimization.  Native and all that.  Unity ran instead of Mono on .NET Core.  Hobby - is an <a href="http://xoofx.com/">interesting blog</a> .  Now he pumped and learned to perform well, but he seemed like a good specialist at once. <br><br>  ‚Üí That's about <a href="https://dotnext-moscow.ru/2018/msk/talks/6qxwwyq5yqo2megee6swke/">his report</a> <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">A photo</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ol/qi/5m/olqi5mlhtz8ycsvjdzi2pdulvew.jpeg"><br></div></div><br>  <b>Egor Bogatov</b> is a dude about optimization and performance, he is from MS.  He knows a lot about low-level optimizations in Mono and .NET Core and drags from one place to another - reimplementit.  Actually, from Core steals, in Mono drags: such Robin Hood, distributing features to monovtsam.  Also the guy from the party, with him cool to meet and chat.  He performs a lot on the Belarusian community, works with Miguel de Icaz in one team. <br><br>  ‚Üí That's about <a href="https://dotnext-moscow.ru/2018/msk/talks/1ek0udhrbg6owiscgyocq4/">his report</a> <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">A photo</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/-t/2-/ih/-t2-ih1ivohzc1h8swwc78vx0qq.jpeg"><br></div></div><br><h3>  Conference as a whole </h3><br>  There will be three large blocks: Architecture, Performance and Internals.
