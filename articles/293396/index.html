  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Anonymity in messengers: rights and obligations</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Anonymity and protection of personal data are now in demand, more than ever.  Everyone, from government agencies to advertisers, needs our data.  And it‚Äôs not even that your people specifically may not be needed by anyone, but in the very opportunity - giving today information about your gender, age and interests to third-party programs and applications, as you can be sure that they will not receive everything else, What do you really want to inform them about? <br><br>  You should always look for balance and understand how and what is distributed from your computer and how it can later be used.  ‚ÄúAnything you say can be used against you,‚Äù as true as ever in our digital, much less mobile era.  Facebook requires a real name, Vkontakte ‚Äúconfirms‚Äù accounts and asks for a passport photo, Telegrams and many other instant messengers are tied to a phone number, like Twitter.  Anonymity recedes under the desire of all to know everything.  And against this background, there are solutions that provide secrecy and privacy that users need - from Tor to anonymous messengers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2fd/5b7/2cd/2fd5b72cd86943a984bcf55ef0fba4c2.jpg"><a name="habracut"></a>

      What if you just want to talk on topics and not ‚Äúshine‚Äù with your face and name, address and date of birth?  We offer <a href="http://chateam.com/">chatim</a> .  Yes, in our application there is authorization and through social networks - this is almost a formal requirement of any service.  It is convenient and logical for everyone.  But there is another option - you can register in the messenger through any e-mail address and choose the name that you like.  For all users, you will be the ones who represent themselves, while remaining outside of Chatima himself. <br><br>  Does this mean that impunity and anarchy reign in ChaTeam?  Of course not.  First, the community is self-regulating and users can always complain about misbehavior, not to mention the fact that channel authors can manage the list of people who may have access to it.  This is also the standard practice of many social networks - without the help of users, it is hardly possible to estimate the entire flow of information that exists.  Secondly, of course in our chat rooms there are moderators who control the adequacy of users and their compliance with human norms. <br><br>  We began by saying that it is always necessary to find a balance between duties and rights.  And in our messenger and social network, we gave users the opportunity to be anyone, to communicate quite anonymously and on any topic, but assigned them to act like a human being. <br><br>  It seems to us that this is the right decision - you want to "live" on the web under you, you want under the name you need.  Both are possible.  We are for freedom and decent communication on interesting topics. <br><br>  Do you think anonymous communication is necessary or is it a relic of the past? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/293396/">https://habr.com/ru/post/293396/</a></p>
