  <section class="page js-page"><h1>New Lenovo season: ThinkPad is more powerful, Yoga 3 is thinner and Yoga Tablet with a projector</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The Chinese company Lenovo on the eve of London organized an annual review of new products, showing new generations of Yoga and ThinkPad Yoga laptops, as well as a new Tablet Yoga Tablet 2. I gathered a detailed description of the new products and several excellent photos in one review. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/801/e87/e89/801e87e89c9448a4b59db7a691f51cc1.jpg"><br>  <i>Lenovo Yoga 3 Pro can be recognized by the brilliant bracelet in the folding area</i> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Lenovo ThinkPad Yoga 14 </h2><br>  The new generation of workers, or as they are called, the Thinkpad business notebooks received a 14-inch display with a resolution of 1920x1080 - the minimum necessary with such a diagonal.  The word Yoga in the title means that this is another Lenovo transformer with a 360-degree foldable keyboard.  This is also one of the latest Lenovo laptops, which preserve the classic trackpoint, which is easy to see on any keyboard photos. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a86/e18/657/a86e18657cec406ba917be7f345d58bd.png">

      Under the hood is an Intel Core i5 processor with an integrated video card.  The Nvidia GeForce 840M video card can be ordered as an option.  The RAM is 8 gigs, the main one is a terabyte hard drive with a 16-gigabyte SSD cache (a terabyte is good, but generally the hard drive on the transformer looks weird). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/92c/496/7b0/92c4967b092f43e18fbcb1f780b03c77.png"><br><br>  From interfaces: card reader, two USB 3.0 and one more USB 2.0 ports.  The weight of 1.9 kg has a ThinkPad at the heavy end of the ultrabook spectrum. <br><br>  As a business notebook, ThinkPad Yoga 14 has an adapter to the docking station. <br><br>  The cost of the laptop will be $ 1,199, and, as they say, Lenovo promises to freeze the dollar against the ruble for this book until the end of the year - obviously, in connection with the next political upheavals for the New Year holidays, it does not start as 3 average salaries. <br><br><h2>  Lenovo Yoga 3 Pro </h2><br>  The main novelty of yesterday‚Äôs presentation is the expected third generation of the Yoga notebook.  Thinner, even lighter: 1.19 kg versus 1.34 kg of the weight of the MacBook Air, considered the main competitor of "Yoga" - Lenovo went exactly one iPhone easier. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5bf/da1/e51/5bfda1e51cea40af8a185eae2b73273a.png"><br><br>  Laptop dimensions are 30x22.8 cm, thickness - 12.8 mm.  This, of course, is not the lightest ultrabook - some impressive Sony Vaio models weigh a <a href="">kilogram</a> and <a href="">even less</a> , but they are no thinner than 16-17 mm, so Lenovo wins in terms of compactness and, of course, flexibility. <br><br>  The display settings have not changed: 3200x1800 pixels in 13.3 inches was quite impressive a year ago. <br><br>  Inside an Intel Core M-5Y70 processor with a default frequency of 1.1 GHz and overclocked to 2.6 GHz.  A lower rated voltage means less power, a flatter design, but also lower performance than standard-voltage processors ‚Äî but that shouldn‚Äôt scare users of everyday use, say the Chinese. <br><br>  Integrated graphics, Intel HD Graphics 5300, which distinguishes it from the Thinkpad Yoga - Yoga 3 is unlikely for games.  But with support for up to three external displays.  Just a bookkeeper‚Äôs dream: how many Excel plates can be opened!  Memory - 256 GB SSD and 8 GB RAM.  Two USB 3.0 ports, a card reader, a micro-HDMI output, as well as a HD webcam and JBL speakers, if you're interested. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/465/380/05d/46538005d6f94a2c9490a6c65fafe9cb.png"><br><br>  A prominent design detail is the silver hinges at the junction of the screen and keyboard.  Their main purpose is not to stick out in the unfolded state, so that the surface of the beechwood laid out 180 degrees is completely flat. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6f3/455/528/6f345552884e44afacfa4c90fad6abed.png"><br><br>  It looks nice - I hope that it will be as reliable. <br><br>  Yoga will cost $ 150 more than the ThinkPad: $ 1,349. <br><br><h2>  Yoga Tablet 2 (Pro) </h2><br>  The Yoga Tablet comes in 3 versions: 8, 10, and 13 inches, plus two versions with Windows 8.1 instead of Android, <a href="http://shop.lenovo.com/us/en/landingpage/yoga-tablet-2/">available for 8-inch and 10-inch versions</a> .  The 13-inch version received the prefix Pro - and we will begin with it. <br><br>  While the rumors around the large iPad remain speculation, Lenovo released the Yoga Tablet 2 Pro: 13.3 "screen resolution of QHD (2560x1440), weight 950 grams and up to 15 hours of battery life. This is almost a compact all-in-one, not a tablet. Surface has received improvements in the form of a cutout under the hook: the Yoga Tablet can be hung on the wall! Perhaps, it lacks only water resistance now - it would be useful in a bathroom. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/395/0d6/da5/3950d6da5b6d431a82ac8a750085b269.jpg"><br>  <i>But Lenovo thinks it's best to watch TV shows while cooking dinner.</i> <br><br>  The killer feature of the tablet is a projector embedded in a cylindrical thickening at the base.  It can produce a picture up to 127 cm (50 inches) diagonally.  As far as this is a necessary feature, you need to look, but the developers claim that thickening at the base is also needed for a more correct weight distribution. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3eb/c85/4f8/3ebc854f8f6b46a9a29a2f9559245cd6.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ceb/7b0/ea4/ceb7b0ea4b614243854026c176b34c7b.jpg"><br><br>  The tablet has two video cameras: the rear 8 MP and the front 1.3 MP.  The built-in memory is 32 GB, the slot for SD cards allows you to increase it by the volume of the card used (recommended up to 64 GB, but we know that there are cards and more compatible).  Unfortunately, information about the processor could not be found - if it appears, I will make an update. <br><br>  Yoga Tablet 2 Pro runs on Android 4.4.4 KitKat - it's not entirely clear why on the 13-inch Android tablet.  Windows 8.1 can only be installed on a 10-inch version of the tablet (without pro).  With a ten-inch modification on Windows, there is also a nice bluetooth keyboard included (for the version with Android, it is available for a fee). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6e1/0e5/fd2/6e10e5fd23234603b1cd5dc6014b7059.png"><br>  <i>Bluetooth Keyboard for 10-inch Yoga Tablet 2</i> <br><br>  Also, Lenovo Yoga Tablet is in the 8-inch version.  Prices (at least in the west) are quite affordable: $ 250, $ 300 and $ 500 for 8, 10 and 13-inch versions on Android and $ 400 for 10-inch Windows.  The price for the 8-inch Win-modification has not yet been determined, but it is obvious that it will be something between $ 300-350. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2014/10/09/lenovo-yoga-3-pro-thinkpad-yoga-14/">source times</a> , <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/2691906/lenovo-recruits-ashton-kutcher-to-unveil-its-new-yoga-3-pro-and-thinkpad-yoga-14.html">source two</a> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/239879/">habra reportage</a> <br><br>  [ <a href="">inform andorro news</a> ] </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/239893/">https://habr.com/ru/post/239893/</a></p>
