The model suits me, in principle, to everyone, but, nevertheless, from time to time, the desire to change it to something else arises.  First, it does not have an optical zoom.  Secondly, this is only a ‚Äúmanual‚Äù camera and nothing more - with its help, you can take pictures from your hand, but it is almost impossible to reliably fix this unit on any land, flood or underwater vehicle.  And so I got the test for Highscreen Black Box Outdoor - this model is a hybrid of a sports camera and a car dvr.  I used it for several weeks, following which this post was born. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/489/d7d/584/489d7d584dab75de75eba41946224a78.jpg"><br>  Highscreen Black Box Outdoor with Kodak EasyShare C123 Sport <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4f7/ac4/09e/4f7ac409eb8698c403927fd33bdcdde9.jpg"><br>  Highscreen Black Box Outdoor comes in this package.

Removable module with screen. <br>  2. Clip for fasteners. <br>  3. Car holder. <br>  4. Holder on the steering wheel of a bicycle or motorcycle. <br>  5. The holder for a flat surface based on 3M adhesive tape (plus a spare adhesive tape sticker). <br>  6. Holder on the helmet. <br>  7. Remote control. <br>  8. Car charger. <br>  9. Sealed plug for connectors. <br>  10. Unsealed plug for connectors. <br>  11. Power cable. <br>  12. USB connection cable. <br>  13. AV cable. <br>  14. Rubberized bag for carrying. <br>  15. Lace to wear around the neck. <br>  16. Quick Start Guide. <br>  17. Warranty card. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6e1/99e/a25/6e199ea2583351a657486a45b8e51040.jpg"><br>  Highscreen Black Box Outdoor Bicycle Helmet <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/31c/938/aa5/31c938aa58349d54d1a9eb3668225436.jpg"><br>  Highscreen Black Box Outdoor on the handlebars <br><br>  For a start - a little about the characteristics.  Highscreen Black Box Outdoor can record video in Full HD 1080p at up to 30 frames per second.  Also, this device can take pictures: the maximum resolution of images reaches 12 megapixels, although the camera actually has a resolution of 5 megapixels.  Therefore, if you set a resolution of more than 5 Mp in the settings, then interpolation will be used.  In the case of video, it is not used in Highscreen Black Box Outdoor - this ‚Äútrick‚Äù with a minus sign, which took place in many budget recorders, is now smoothly becoming a thing of the past (and thank God). <br><br>  Externally, Highscreen Black Box Outdoor is a cylinder with a lens at one end and a socket with MiniUSB ports, HDMI, two microphones, a microSD card slot (up to 32 GB, 64 does not work, tested) and a video resolution switch on the other. (720p / 1080p). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c7c/4d2/a7c/c7c4d2a7c6624b91b1ba5f793b1c492e.jpg"><br><br>  There is also a thread on which one of the three complete nozzles is wound.  Two of them are plastic caps - with holes and without.  The first can be used, for example, when shooting from the helm of a bicycle, the second - for underwater shooting (as it is sealed).  The third nozzle is the so-called screen module.  It has a small, 1.5-inch display, keys for control and configuration, and another microUSB port.  That is, Highscreen Black Box Outdoor can be charged by itself, and with an attached screen module.  By the way, with the latter, this recorder / extreme camera resembles a small DSLR with a telephoto lens. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6eb/43d/221/6eb43d221c046fc3431fe15d460c8828.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a59/500/b18/a59500b188d3e14711c6cb4aaf99433a.jpg"><br>  Plug first, "underwater" <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/69a/a94/b86/69aa94b86643c49502ee182c5677af90.jpg"><br>  Cap second, with perforation <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3ed/aa4/20c/3edaa420ce5e490b52b484a083bf61fd.jpg"><br>  Highscreen Black Box Outdoor with a screen module connected <br><br>  The case is trimmed with soft-touch plastic and is very carefully assembled (which is especially important for ‚Äúunderwater‚Äù gadgets, since any microscopic gap can lead to damage). <br><br>  It is curious that the lace comes with the Highscreen Black Box Outdoor, but I did not immediately understand how it was attached.  As a result, I moved off the slide in the water park, the device flew out of my hand, and then we, in a crowd of five people, looked for him at the bottom of the pool.  Later it dawned on me that the cord was attached as follows: before tightening any of the two caps, you need to put it on the recorder, and then press it down with this very stub.  Holds the cord quite securely. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/237/392/961/237392961d4fee5a8f817e61474f9074.jpg"><br><br>  In all honesty, I‚Äôll say that I personally didn‚Äôt find much sense in the module with the display.  Yes, it allows you to view captured video and photos, but I used the Samsung Galaxy S4 for these purposes.  That is, a card was removed from the Highscreen Black Box Outdoor, inserted into a smartphone, and so on through the list.  That's what I always do with the Kodak EasyShare C123 Sport: it even has a larger display, but still it‚Äôs not very convenient to consider the content.  Meanwhile, during the direction of the lens on the road or some other object without a screen, you can also do: the High Level Black Box Outdoor has a laser level - that is, a red beam, as in well-known pointers. <br><br>  However, without a screen module, Highscreen Black Box Outdoor can only write video - for this purpose, a special key is provided on its case (by the way, it's rather tight).  To photograph, you need to either connect the screen, or use the complete remote control.  It is here that a very serious lack of a device is hidden for me personally: unlike the Outdoor itself, the console is not protected from water, so you won‚Äôt take it to the sea.  The screen module is even more so.  And if so, then under water with the help of Highscreen Black Box Outdoor you can only write video.  I like to photograph fish and sea urchins rather, and not to make films about their hard life. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c19/5ba/4eb/c195ba4eb0ae4a19d6b13dffb601893d.jpg"><br><br>  On the other hand, Highscreen Black Box Outdoor video copes very well - much better than Kodak.  And this concerns not only the resolution (Full HD against VGA), but also its quality.  Here are a couple of examples (I highly recommend watching it on YouTube, setting Full HD 1080p resolution before this): <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/zoF4gaNglL4%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700255&amp;usg=ALkJrhgF3B2iV9OwTXFBhlaNfcQkjjUcMA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/TrfsKJ1xZ1M%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700255&amp;usg=ALkJrhji4lCEimbmXbfVMB-pFsXHUhwZlA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  The cylindrical shape of the device, in my opinion, is also a controversial point.  Yes, thanks to her, Highscreen Black Box Outdoor has turned out to be quite compact (diameter is about 30 mm, length is 80).  However, at the same time, due to the cylindrical shape, it is not always possible to fix it in the hand in the ‚Äúup-button‚Äù position - it is in it that the horizon does not collapse and normal rollers are obtained.  But if you take it in your hand incorrectly, then <s>it will lose the network signal - antennagate, pancake</s> video will be "oblique."  Over time, of course, you learn to keep Black Box Outdoor as needed, and yet there is such a nuance. <br><br>  It was possible to test the device not only in water, but also in much more extreme conditions.  I have one friend who loves all sorts of radio-controlled gadgets.  He currently owns the AMG Mercedes C-Class DTM 2008, assembled with the help of De Agostini magazine.  That is, you buy numbers, and one of them comes with each of them.  You buy, collect, spend almost a thousand dollars - and at the exit you get an all-wheel drive machine with a Lexan body, a spring suspension and a gasoline engine that can accelerate to 80 kilometers per hour. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a64/e1e/d0a/a64e1ed0aa1f186dc594242b5bb740a9.jpg"><br>  While the owner is preparing the chassis ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d53/10e/125/d5310e125b164ae6f7fd33e14fd0a1c6.jpg"><br>  ... we fix Highscreen Black Box Outdoor on the Lexan case <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ebf/056/fcd/ebf056fcd9b1c8f27f2ccefcba6b1cd5.jpg"><br>  Chassis near the hull <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/80c/4f9/b83/80c4f9b83201d2d9cfeadafa2d12aea9.jpg"><br>  All together looks like this <br><br>  So he already attached to it a certain nameless hybrid of the recorder and extreme cameras, bought on eBay for about $ 100.  Everything would be fine, but the flimsy mount from the mad shaking (there is no smooth asphalt in Russia, do not forget) fell apart, the unfortunate registrar flew off to the side and with all the dope cracked the asphalt.  Therefore, we clung to the typewriter with some apprehension on Highscreen Black Box Outdoor - we didn‚Äôt want to kill this thing for 8 thousand rubles after the ‚ÄúChinese‚Äù.  Fortunately, Outdoor and its 3M adhesive tape holder passed this test without any problems. <br><br>  The output is such a video (I repeat: the asphalt is not too smooth, the suspension is small and tough, the Lexan body sways from side to side, speed up to 80 km / h): <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/e5gtYGt8I5g%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700255&amp;usg=ALkJrhjH5SJP3c-nvyXXbWn1nVEtPedAyw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  But how it all looked from the outside: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/0Kxnyc5zFCk%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700255&amp;usg=ALkJrhjIeJGIjZG91VDvfKYiyGVSV7o7eg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Just in case, I will give a couple of examples of automotive video - day and night. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/em02JCENBmg%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700255&amp;usg=ALkJrhjnJ88pimimFKe4DQw_rlsFTDIy9Q" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/wgtjxy0HzWI%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700255&amp;usg=ALkJrhjuCDLowED21ES2vPNFO5t2lTdl9g" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Due to its compactness, the Highscreen Black Box Outdoor can be easily positioned behind the rear-view mirror, both with and without the screen module disconnected.  Recording starts automatically when the engine is turned on.  In standalone mode, the device works up to one and a half hours. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/0ef/d2b/468/0efd2b4688189efd6ae32d98770b247d.jpg"><br>  Highscreen Black Box Outdoor in car <br><br>  In general, the device is interesting.  Not without flaws, of course, but more advantages.  I wanted it in my collection (and, probably, I will buy it), but, alas, I cannot replace the ‚Äúunderwater‚Äù camera.  Just because fotkat underwater Highscreen Black Box Outdoor can not.  If you are interested in the ability to shoot video at a depth of 5 meters - then yes, the option is not bad.  Moreover, on the way from the seaside resort, you can use it in the car as a DVR. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/189850/">https://habr.com/ru/post/189850/</a></p>
