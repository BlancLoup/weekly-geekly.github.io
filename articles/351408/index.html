"Network Basics".  "Collaboration Software from Cisco."  Eddie Martin  December 2012 </h4><br>  I will tell you about Cisco products, which are collaboration applications, that is, collaboration. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/yp/un/7f/ypun7f9tj3h5e4gmlznrieimpok.jpeg"><br><br>  Cisco WebEx - we already talked about the training center, the conference center, the center of events, and that WebEx is a cloud-based video conferencing application protected by your firewall. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/g2/qa/xr/g2qaxroqoek4xtumwj2zpqde7ik.jpeg"><br><br>  Cisco Jabber is a series of clients for creating voice and video chats on various stationary and mobile platforms: Windows, Mac, Android, iPad, iPhone, Blackberry, for video conferencing and demonstration of your desktop. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/s2/6-/ab/s26-abr7c9rrqsqbclwmylk3l-c.jpeg"><br><br>  I can ‚Äúpick up the phone‚Äù Jabber on my ‚ÄúiPhone‚Äù and call my wife just as if I used an IP phone for this.  With it, you can organize a chat with all corporate phone numbers.  Suppose I work at Cisco, you call me on a Google Voice number and leave a message, then I have to send it to my boss.  Because voice mail is the intellectual property of the company.  This is still a great corporate solution for business, and for conversations with customers outside the corporate network it is better to use Google services. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gf/qq/sq/gfqqsqzzmkk7mclhc26h6tf_-xo.jpeg"><br><br>  WebEx Social is a portal.  We need to understand why a social network is important, and consider WebEx Social as a corporate Facebook.  This is the way that company employees can share information. <br><br>  Suppose you are traveling so fast that you do not have time to place text or a table on a page on the Internet.  When you came to work at Cisco, did you see that all the information necessary for work is posted on web pages?  No, if you needed something for work, you turned to someone who knows how to do this, to your competitor.  When you got acquainted with the new Avaya product that you have never seen before, you understood that Cisco does not have the necessary information, but you had a colleague who worked with Avaya and knew about this product.  You did not send him a business letter that goes months to find out the information you need!  You would use Jabber or WebEx Social and talk to him in a social network.  That is why it is important for business. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/t9/qv/vv/t9qvvvj9wthom_xyfb2oghsdeww.jpeg"><br><br>  I use an unusual term for you and I will say that in this case we are talking about unspoken information.  It is not in the database, it is in the head.  Social portals help you get exactly the information that is in the mind of people, and not on the pages of the site. <br><br>  I will give you an example of how quickly information is spreading in my family.  I was at a football tournament, Sarah plays football and loves him very much, she was in many places where tournaments were held.  We went to the city of Winston-Salem in North Carolina to play two games in the tournament.  In my SUV was a whole bunch of children.  I didn‚Äôt shut the back door badly and when we drove onto the highway, it opened.  My car cooler fell to the floor and from there and onto the road bottles, cans of soda, and other trifles fell out.  I pulled over to the side of the road and began to collect banks, and members of our team rushed past me with their families, laughing and shouting, "Hey, Eddie, get out of the middle of the road before you are crushed!" <br><br>  After that, we didn‚Äôt even drive two miles from the scene, as my brother-in-law's brother-in-law called and said: ‚ÄúYou know that North Carolina police are looking for someone who scattered beer cans and water bottles all over the highway!‚Äù  He was 200 miles from this place, how could he so quickly find out about it?  Thanks Sarah!  My little daughter took photos of these cans and bottles scattered on the highway and sent them to her Facebook page!  And the son of brother-in-law was on Facebook at that time and saw these photos.  Here is an example of how quickly information is distributed. <br><br>  Do you know that company management takes care of this?  They want older people like me to share their knowledge with newcomers through a social network. <br><br>  Each generation has its own approach to information.  The first thing I do when I go online is check my email.  Emily will not do that, because the mail page she has is behind the pages of social networks, and she needs to be pulled onto the screen.  These are very important things, and we need to talk about this with our customers. <br><br>  The so-called Social Miner in contact centers are applications that analyze messages on social networks and ‚Äúpull out‚Äù of them common patterns and trends of information.  Who needs them?  Marketers! <br><br>  Imagine my daughter Sarah likes Lady Gaga.  Lady Gaga has 30 million fans following her on Twitter.  She enters a restaurant and tweets about it, and 30 million people can immediately form their opinion about it.  Are they potential customers?  Of course!  Therefore, all sorts of marketing organizations, merchants, businessmen associated with trade, are very fond of social networks and everything that concerns them. <br><br>  I see, among you, a discussion ensued about how to correctly understand the information provided on social networks, whether it is always true or allows to interpret any fact in two ways.  Indeed, this can be a problem, but not for corporate social networks.  Here they said that the "miners" find keywords that allow to obtain information about the attitude of people to an event or product.  It really is.  Therefore, when working with clients, it is important to pay attention to their comments posted under your information. <br><br>  The following applications are a series of programs for Cisco Contact Center, including Cisco Packaged Contact Center Enterprise and Cisco Unified Contact Center Express.  There are a lot of them.  They have many features that are not in previous applications. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ni/d8/5e/nid85es5wchjnawvhu30d42hhre.jpeg"><br><br>  Contact Center Enterprise is a customizable, flexible platform for all interaction channels; it includes various extensions such as Media Sense and Social Miner.  This is a great and very important tool for working with a client, working with it can be called ‚Äújuggling with a chainsaw‚Äù, you are ‚Äúspinning‚Äù around the clock.  These are 4 or 5 modules interacting with each other for communication with the client.  Microsotf doesn't have such a solution, they will just give you a business card and say: ‚ÄúGo, talk to this person.‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zu/gv/hz/zugvhz73fqtg5l-2dquu4b6hf9s.jpeg"><br><br>  The multimedia and distributed contact center of the Cisco Unified Contact Center is part of the Cisco Unified Communications system and creates the foundation for automating business processes to efficiently serve customer calls, which is an essential element of a stable business. <br><br>  We sell these solutions through selected partners who can install and customize them, some of them are good, some are not.  We do this in order to get a part of our profits and ‚Äúgive live‚Äù to our partners. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/3d/ca/wm/3dcawmt02-i0en4bzipo36s_8fi.jpeg"><br><br>  Here are our systems for telepresentations - TX9000, external codecs for lowering bitrate, equipment of MX and EX series, kits for quick installation, equipment for medical telepresentations and in general any types of telepresentations.  These are very popular and well-selling products.  Next you see Conductor Manager DMC and MCS 8000 recording content server. If you want to record your conference, there is a whole television studio for telepresentations for this.  She records the whole transmission channel. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/5k/iq/vh/5kiqvhler9yxfd2xrqgxl9jelwu.jpeg"><br><br>  We also have a managed host for Managed and Hosted TelePresence television presentations if you need to host a conference on the server.  This is a WebEx solution. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/8r/8h/7z/8r8h7zszepiksd6npidflxebe9m.jpeg"><br><br>  Business Edition 6000 Series is a Cisco virtual server.  This is the UCS C230 M3 server, which has a CM communications manager for voice and video calls, allowing you to connect up to 1000 devices, a CUC voice mail module for 1000 devices, a CCX express contact center for 100 agents, a VCS module for video, and a CUPS presentation service.  That is, it contains 5 devices in one case. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/yd/hj/at/ydhjatc9o7wcugawauln6rvozqs.jpeg"><br><br>  But I do not tell customers about the full range of our products, I tell them about what equipment reveals their business opportunities.  I explain the situation to them like this. <br><br>  Suppose you have a small PBX and you still want to send voice messages, how do you communicate your presence?  You will not shout: ‚ÄúHey, I'm on the spot!‚Äù, Type a message on the keyboard or make a phone call.  So, you need a solution that combines all communications capabilities, you press one button in the same interface and see everyone, and everyone sees you.  Imagine how this raises your level in front of your customers.  This ‚Äúbox‚Äù provides such opportunities for 1000 people.  One RACK module - one solution. <br><br>  How can this change your business?  We give you the technology and adapt it to the requirements of your business.  You can communicate in chat rooms, use video calls, and can cooperate effectively thanks to our products.  We need to tell customers about the specific benefits of our product, otherwise they will look at this entire range, turn around and leave. <br><br>  You need to present our products as I tell you about it.  With your customers, you need to talk about opportunities for cooperation. <br><br>  There is another VXI product, the Cisco Virtualization Environment for Virtual Desktops.  There is a client that separates the data from the real-time protocols, the complete process architecture.  If your customers are interested in VDI, you can advise them to turn their attention to this architecture.  Here we work together with Citrix and VMWare. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GOIA9mp6lOU" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <b>Continued:</b> <br><br>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/ua-hosting/blog/351418/">FastTrack Training.</a>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/ua-hosting/blog/351418/">"Network Basics".</a>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/ua-hosting/blog/351418/">"Value of Collaboration Products from Cisco."</a>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/ua-hosting/blog/351418/">Eddie Martin</a>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/ua-hosting/blog/351418/">December 2012</a> <br><br>  Thank you for staying with us.
