How trade scales turn into a marketing tool</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/7r/u_/m8/7ru_m8t-_wzqhfawqcuybfh2zxo.jpeg"><br><br>  Cutlets separately, flies separately - not the most suitable motto for modern retail.  If you buy commercial equipment, then you should make full use of its capabilities, including marketing.  We tell how the scales with a touch screen and scales with label printing turn into a full-fledged marketing tool in the store. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h2>  Multimedia on the screen </h2><br>  An excellent communication method with customers and a marketing tool are multimedia scales using the store's advertising content.  They are able to weigh the goods, and in idle moments to inform customers about promotions, offers and news of the retailer.  We are talking about the familiar self-service scales (for example, Bizerba X-Class 800, CAS CL7000-S, <a href="https://www.pilot.ru/catalog/vesy-samoobsluzhivaniya/d955d/">Dibal D955D</a> ) and other trading scales equipped with a touch screen: as an example, suspended scales with an external <a href="https://www.pilot.ru/catalog/podvesnye-vesy/d955-h/">Dibal D-955 H</a> screen .  Each of these devices is able to broadcast any multimedia content: photos, videos, sound files.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/od/jq/2h/odjq2hvansmoll_za7loczzsab4.jpeg"><br><br>  Of course, not everything is rosy: retailers need to be prepared for the fact that the introduction of any more advanced technologies requires additional costs.  In this case, there may be an item of expenditure on the infrastructure and the employee who forms the content for broadcast.  It is necessary to take into account the load that will fall on the shoulders of the system administrators of the store: in addition to administering the cash desk servers, they will have to deal with additional unloading of multimedia files onto the scales. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zf/2v/ev/zf2vevjx3kweicpdek_czx1md58.jpeg"><br><br>  Despite the obviousness of the decision, it is practically not used.  According to our observations, out of 10 large Russian retailers of the federal scale, only 2 demonstrate multimedia content on scales with touch screens. <br><br><h2>  Recommendations on the screen and in the check </h2><br>  We are expanding the idea with a demonstration of multimedia content on the screen of trading weights.  Nothing prevents the store from weighing individual recommendations when weighing the goods.  For example, the buyer weighs cucumbers.  And on the scales screen, in addition to the information about the weighted product, the recipe for the salad "Olivier" is shown.  Moreover, it highlights other ingredients that can be weighed in this section.  So the store can try to expand the check, pushing the customer to buy the missing products for cooking. <br><br>  You can upload recipes to the scales using specialized software.  For example, Pilot‚Äôs <a href="https://www.pilot.ru/catalog/programmnoe-obespechenie/scale-service/">software</a> is responsible for the <a href="https://www.pilot.ru/catalog/programmnoe-obespechenie/scale-service/">ScaleService software</a> , which was created for the centralized management of store weighing equipment.  It provides data transfer on goods to electronic scales.  The process of transferring information is carried out in automatic mode upon downloading data from the accounting system of the store. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vq/-j/mu/vq-jmusruosvwpoftf1cqngqjza.png"><br><br>  Similar information can be displayed not only on the screen, but also on a large format label.  This can be done thanks to the technology of the so-called label without the substrate or "endless label."  You can enter both product data and promotional information on it.  In addition to the recipe for an example of promo, holding promotions with coupons.  They can be printed on the purchase receipt.  Upon presentation of them in the next visit to the store, the buyer will receive a discount. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/dv/fn/jw/dvfnjw9tu2fuavgxlbbz891g0-m.jpeg"><br><br><h2>  Integration of scales and large diagonal screens </h2><br>  The relevance of integrating trade weights and large diagonal screens in self-service areas is due to the fact that it is often difficult for buyers to find a specific product on a small weights screen.  Especially when it comes to the department where similar products are sold.  For example, candies with almonds and peanuts, differing from each other only by the inscription on the wrapper.  To solve this problem allows the integration of digital panels and scales. <br><br>  When choosing a product, the customer will be able to see his enlarged image on the screen, and weighing will be performed on standard weighing scales with check printing.  At the same time, in moments of idleness, the panel is able to demonstrate the content needed by the retailer, for example, to notify customers about store promotions. <br><br>  Trade scales can be an excellent marketing tool.  They are able to significantly increase store sales and increase customer loyalty to it.  However, for this it is necessary not to ignore, but, on the contrary, to maximally introduce in the trade all the capabilities of the devices incorporated by the manufacturers. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/352344/">https://habr.com/ru/post/352344/</a></p>
