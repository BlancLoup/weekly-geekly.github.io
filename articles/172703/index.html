  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Users do not tolerate buggy applications - only 16% will give such an application a third chance</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  According to a recent <a href="http://investor.compuware.com/releasedetail.cfm%3FReleaseID%3D747433">study by</a> Compuware, in the near future the ecosystem of mobile applications will not suffer a crisis - the majority of smartphone users (85%) still prefer applications to mobile websites.  They believe that applications are more convenient (55%), faster (48%) and simpler (40%).  Of course, this data is not surprising - native solutions, as a rule, always work better.  But the interesting attitude of users to unstable applications.  79% of respondents reported that they would try to restart the application only once or twice, if it did not work properly for the first time. <br><br>  And only 16% said they would give them more than two attempts. <br><br>  Now it is difficult to find users who would never have experienced problems in the use of applications.  Compuware says that 62% of users have experienced crashes, freezes, or application errors.  Another 47% were faced with a long launch of applications.  At 40%, some applications did not run at all.

But this far from neutral position should not confuse anyone - the published data from this does not become less reliable.  This study was conducted last October - almost at the same time that the research firm Flurry also conducted a detailed study of the involvement of users of mobile applications. <br><br>  Then Flurry calculated that on average, the application is used 3.7 times, which is significantly less than 6.7 times in 2009. The fact is that the attention of users is now distributed to a significantly larger number of applications. <br><br>  Nielsen last spring reported that on average, users have 41 apps on a smartphone, which is 28% more than 32 apps in 2011. <br><br>  Meanwhile, mobile app stores are growing without stopping - there are about 800,000 apps in the Apple App Store, about 750,000 in Google Play.  However, users of already well-established publishers, newcomers find it difficult to break through on the market and achieve success, the market is crowded and old publishers have certain advantages on it. <br><br>  Back in 2011, about a quarter of downloaded mobile applications were used only once and then erased.  Current users are even more impermanent due to the ever-growing choice.  According to Mobilewalla, approximately 80-90% of applications are eventually deleted from phones. <br><br>  So developers have only one chance to make a good first impression.  In addition, all of this suggests that users have little tolerance for malfunctioning applications (if this is not Facebook, of course). <br><br>  Compuware also calculated that users expect applications to run much faster, on average, giving them only 2 seconds per download. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/311/92c/030/31192c030c8c916284a4d0e7a2ba456f.jpg"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/172703/">https://habr.com/ru/post/172703/</a></p>
