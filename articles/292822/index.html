He grew up in the provincial town of New Lisbon <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Lisbon,_Wisconsin"><sup>★</sup></a> (Wisconsin).  Her father, Lowell, was a sales manager at Pioneer Hi-Bred International <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pioneer_Hi-Bred_International"><sup>★</sup></a> grain company, and her mother, Pat, worked as a customer at the Lands' End <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lands%2527_End"><sup>★</sup></a> clothing store.  But I did not learn all this from Andreessen.  His close friend told me: “We never discuss his parents or his brother.  "They did not love me, I reciprocated them" - that's all he said about them. " <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  A number of details led me to the conclusion that Andriessen grew up in an atmosphere of archaic, superstition, disappointment and poverty.  “Nature is destined for man to be a farmer, who produces himself a living.  Exactly such a future was expected from me. ”  Andrésen added that he was surrounded by "Scandinavian, tough, very self-limiting people who lived their lives without hoping to be happy."  The telephone line was shared with neighbors, and the toilet was on the street.  Everyone believed in gozling <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259B%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B7%25D0%25BE%25D1%2585%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B4%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE"><sup>★</sup></a> and in weather forecasts from the Farmers Almanac <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farmers%2527_Almanac"><sup>★</sup></a> .  Once, in the middle of winter, it was tight with money, and my father decided not to pay for gas.  "And we have a hell of a lot of time spent splitting the damned wood."  The local cinema, through the town from the house, was not heated, and in combination was used as a fertilizer warehouse.  Andreessen watched "Star Wars" in a huge down jacket from Pioneer Hi-Bred, sitting on the components of a huge bomb <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259D%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D1%258B"><sup>★</sup></a> .  The nearest bookstore, Waldenbooks <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waldenbooks"><sup>★</sup></a> , was an hour away, in La Crosse <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259B%25D0%25B0-%25D0%259A%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2581_(%25D0%2592%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD)"><sup>★</sup></a> ;  his shelves filled cooking books and calendars with kittens.  Therefore, later Andrerissen perceived Amazon <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon.com"><sup>★</sup></a> as a great achievement in the dissemination of knowledge and progress.  "I spit all these independent books," he assured me.  “None was where I grew up.  All of them were only near the colleges, and those who live far away, those were sent to crush the sand <a href="http://ru.urbandictionary.com/define.php%3Fterm%3DPound%2BSand"><sup>★</sup></a> ”. <br><br>  Andreessen podcherpnul his vision of the future and the path to salvation from television.  “KITT, the car in“ Knight of the roads ” <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A0%25D1%258B%25D1%2586%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D1%258C_%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3_(%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB,_1982)"><sup>★</sup></a> , was a computer capable of repelling a gas attack.  The car was a miracle, but now it all came true.  The new car today is certainly not KITT, but it has all the cards and all the music of the world, and he is talking to you.  And if you catch the idea of ​​quantum entanglement <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259A%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BF%25D1%2583%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D1%258C"><sup>★</sup></a> , even the transport beam <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A2%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F"><sup>★</sup></a> from Star Trek <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2597%25D0%25B2%25D1%2591%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25B9_%25D0%25BF%25D1%2583%25D1%2582%25D1%258C"><sup>★</sup></a> makes sense.

      It seems that the transport beam still clings to Andreessen, as if he had just materialized, arriving from the city on the edge of eternity.  He is not very good in everyday affairs: he gets confused in directions, because the highway is illogical, and he is so desperate to find his sunglasses that he keeps in the hallway a whole “spare parts store” with nine spare pairs.  Perhaps Edison would not have refused to talk with him, since Andriessen is also a jack of all trades, except that instead of a piece of iron in his system and platform, and the workshop housed himself right in the head.  He regularly reprograms his appearance and manners — a sort of user interface — to better fit his current role.  And his friends mention different periods of his life as versions of the operating system: “Mark 1.0”, “Mark 2.0”, etc.  Being a charismatic introvert, Andriessen attracts people, but does not really want to see them around.  And although he has a lively sense of humor, he doesn’t often use it of his own accord.  He hates being praised, staring at, or touching him.  It seems to him a funny idea to wear a T-shirt that says “Do not hug.  Do not touch.  He does not particularly follow the rules of etiquette and does not seek to chat about the question that has arisen.  It is more convenient for him to receive a written message to which he can reply by e-mail, typing one hundred forty words per minute.  He refused to attend the Netscape <a href="http://www.internethistorypodcast.com/2014/04/on-the-20th-anniversary-an-oral-history-of-netscapes-founding/"><sup>★</sup></a> twentieth anniversary because of the fatal combination of two of the most disgusting things: parties and nostalgic digging in the past. <br><br>  Nonetheless, he is energetic and determined, which makes him a valuable adviser.  In 2006, Yahoo!  <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!"><sup>★</sup></a> Suggested a billion dollars for Facebook <a href="http://www.inc.com/allison-fass/peter-thiel-mark-zuckerberg-luck-day-facebook-turned-down-billion-dollars.html"><sup>★</sup></a> .  Accel Partners <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accel_Partners"><sup>★</sup></a> Venture Fund, Facebook's main investor, urged Mark Zuckerberg <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A6%25D1%2583%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B3,_%25D0%259C%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D0%25BA"><sup>★</sup></a> to accept the deal.  Andreissen says that “everyone on Facebook wanted Mark to accept the offer of Yahoo!  The psychological pressure on this twenty-two year old guy was incredible.  Mark and I held on to each other during this period because I repeated: “Do not sell, do not sell, do not sell!” ”Zuckerberg says:“ Mark is convinced that when a company succeeds in following its vision successfully, it can render much more influence on the world.  And this influence is underestimated.  It is no longer just a business, but an order over the fate of humanity.  Moreover, this is possible only if the company gets enough time for its development. ”And he did not sell the company.  Facebook is now valued at two hundred and eighteen billion dollars. <br><br>  Andreissen draws inspiration from a wide range of sources from Ibn Khaldun <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2598%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BD_%25D0%25A5%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25B4%25D1%2583%25D0%25BD"><sup>★</sup></a> to South Park <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25AE%25D0%25B6%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25B9_%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D0%25BA"><sup>★</sup></a> .  At the same time, he, as if starving, clutches at any topic, absorbing them one by one.  Men's fashion, making whiskey, the policy of Congress - will survive everything until it finishes the last crumb.  When Twitter overwhelmed the storm on the subject of network neutrality <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A1%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B9_%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B9%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582"><sup>★</sup></a> , he noted that everyone who expresses a position on this issue should be well-versed in questions of “history, technology, economics of trunk lines, agreement on traffic exchange, peering <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D0%25B8%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B3"><sup>★</sup></a> , CDN-ah <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_Delivery_Network"><sup>★</sup></a> , caching, server hosting, current and future business models in the telecommunications industry and the cable industry, including capital and operating costs, marginal rates, cost of capital, investment returns, ”and a dozen more complex matters.  Modestly noting that nobody at the same time understands all this, including himself, he nevertheless expounded his personal opinion on this issue.  Education Andrissen is a fusion of idiosyncrasy to self-education with the thoroughness that programmers call "search in depth" <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA_%25D0%25B2_%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BB%25D1%2583%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D1%2583"><sup>★</sup></a> .  “It has always been unbearable for me not to know the answer to the question“ why, ”he explains.  “We need to dig deep to understand how politics began, the initial motivation.  I always stop by getting to evolutionary psychology.  Well, okay, we are primates, we carry on ourselves the curse of emotions and the ability to think logically. "  He recalls again and again that we are Australopithecus, and continues to try to turn us into Homo habilis <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A7%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA_%25D1%2583%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D1%258B%25D0%25B9"><sup>★</sup></a> : a person using tools, a skillful person. <br><br>  To this he leads any topic.  For example, deriving the dialectic from the fact that Google bought the manufacturer of thermostats Nest <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nest_Labs"><sup>★</sup></a> .  “Or 1) Nest is the most amazing of all the companies in the history of mankind, or 2) Larry Page <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B9%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B6,_%25D0%259B%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8"><sup>★</sup></a> through takeover hired Tony Fadell <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A4%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BB,_%25D0%25A2%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8"><sup>★</sup></a> for $ 3.2 billion, and got the thermostats business to workload.”  Synthesis from what has been said often represents either a simplification of the thesis and antithesis (“Or, perhaps, this is all part of Google’s larger plan to automate households”), or avoiding the topic (“Why did he give up at all. Well, we didn’t buy it, well, to hell with him. ”) He is often so keen on his speech that his cheeks turn red and he has to pause to catch his breath.  If you manage to catch the moment in order to demonstrate a basic understanding of his arguments, he will spread into a smile, say, “That-oh-oh!” - and continue to load you with the next piece of information.  From the stigma of the pompous know-it-all, only his thirst for communication saves him. <br><br>  He constantly returns to his theories just as an alcoholic reaches for his drink.  But Horowitz says that sometimes Andreessen is ready to “raise the whole of Wisconsin against you in order to protect his people.  When we studied the topic of online pawnshops, people around began to talk about how immoral this was.  Mark, then simply furious: “If you don’t have a damn cent and you have to lay a watch to feed the children, is it fuckingly immoral just because it hurts the feelings of the rich bastards?” He had such a familiar friend who laid his watch, so as not to miss the harvest.  Something like that.  When he saw “Uber for private flights” <a href="http://www.bbc.com/capital/story/20150701-private-jets-uber-style"><sup>★</sup></a> or something related to wine <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/the-best-apps-for-wine-lovers-2015-5"><sup>★</sup></a> , he was furious: “We didn’t create a company so that the rich could buy a hundred dollars a bottle for a bottle or fly around to of his disgusting private airplanes! ”With emotional stress, he reminds Kanye - his childhood was so terrible that he doesn’t want to return there at all” ▼ <br><br>  <i>To be continued…</i> <br><br>  <a href="http://megamozg.ru/post/17524/">Part 1</a> |  <a href="http://megamozg.ru/post/17558/">Part 2</a> |  <a href="http://megamozg.ru/post/17646/">Part 3 ←</a> |  Part 4 |  <a href="http://megamozg.ru/post/17748/">→ Part 5</a> |  <a href="http://megamozg.ru/post/17780/">Part 6</a> |  <a href="http://megamozg.ru/post/17984/">Part 7</a> |  <a href="http://megamozg.ru/post/18074/">Part 8</a> <br><br><hr><br>  About the author: Ted Friend has been a <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/contributors/tad-friend">regular contributor to The New Yorker</a> since 1998.
