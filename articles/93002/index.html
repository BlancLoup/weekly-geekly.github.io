It turned out quite a decent quest. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>Level 1:</b> Register on the portal using SNILS and TIN.  There is nothing complicated here; you just need to have the above-mentioned pieces of paper and the address where after 2 weeks (and exactly) a registered letter arrived with an activation code.

      <b>Level 2:</b> Filling out a passport application.  This is where the problems begin: At the time of my filling, the area was not automatically selected, that is, it was necessary to look for the necessary branch of the FMS in the list and if there are more than one (for example, in my area there is the Izmailovo and Izmailovo East branches), try to guess the correct one. <br><br>  <b>Level 3: The</b> size of the photo you want to upload to the website is rather vague.  It sounds like this: ‚Äúthe desired file should be obtained when scanning a paper photograph of size NxM cm with a resolution of 600 dpi‚Äù.  Which implies either the presence of a paper photograph or the ability to count the required number of pixels (I did after several attempts 836x1032).  And the usual paper photo will not work, as indicated, that the background should not be white. <br><br>  <b>Level 4:</b> When sending the questionnaire, it turned out that the system does not understand the quotes in the name of the ATS, which gave me a passport (but this was cured simply by removing the quotes) and the name of my street.  With the second it turned out to be more difficult - it was not possible to find the correct spelling, and I called in support of the public services portal.  There I was offered to leave a request to a specialist and promised to consider it in 2 days.  After 2 days, they took away what was not yet done, and after 4 they said that the address is handled by the FMS - call them.  On the phone of my branch of the FMS all the day I answered the fax ... Well, I thought, to hell with you.  I guess the benefit of the options is not too much.  After about 50 options (as the register of various parts of the street name, as it turned out, has meaning) I guessed the correct name (2nd Park, although the 2nd Park Street is written on the map and in the passport) and the questionnaire was accepted. <br><br>  <b>Level 5:</b> After 4 days in the personal account on the site there was a record that I should come to the head of my department of the FMS with a certified copy of my work, a copy of my passport and a paid receipt.  What time to come and where to get the receipt form was not mentioned.  On the website of public services and the website of the FMS links to the receipt, I did not find.  However, I found a receipt for a couple of minutes using a search engine.  But with the time of arrival it turned out to be more difficult: as I already spoke on the phone, only the fax answered, so I decided to send them a question by fax (without much hope of answering).  But an hour later the head of my department of the FMS called me and asked when I could come to them.  We agreed about the time and I went there this morning. <br><br>  <b>Level 6:</b> I came to the FMS.  Saw a queue.  I thought I'd be stuck there for a long time. But there was no way to the office to the head of the queue.  The head of the queue took me to the office where they accepted the documents.  Then the following problem emerged - the list of documents that is listed on the website of public services (a copy of labor and a receipt) does not correspond to what the girls wanted from me when receiving documents (certified form + photo (paper!) + Receipt) after some short appearances and my request to write a written refusal, my documents were accepted (but with great reluctance), they took a picture of me on my passport and were told to come after him in a month and one week. <br><br>  <b>Level 7:</b> I will find out in a month ... <br><br>  <b>Conclusions:</b> The system certainly works, but the hemorrhoids are not much smaller.  True in my case, the advantage was the lack of standing in the general queue. <br><br>  If the portal developers and the employees of the FMS read it - agree on a list of documents that you need to carry.  And also make a normal feedback link with users and the opportunity not to fill in the questionnaire again if there is an error (refusal) in it. <br><br>  UPD: Help from the military office or military ID did not require me, since I am 29 years old. <br>  UPD2: looked at KLADR - there my street is called ‚ÄúParkovaya 2 nd Street‚Äù, that is, this is already the third option (unlike the name on the map and in the FMS) <br>  UPD3: Let me explain about the paper photo: in the paper form that they had, there was data from the site and the photo I downloaded.  And the photo was printed on the form itself.  So they demanded from me another photo that they wanted to stick on top of the printed one, motivating it with the fact that the printed one is ‚Äúnot original, but digital, and so it‚Äôs generally supposed to be.‚Äù  After my request to define the original photo, they thought for a few minutes and accepted the documents. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/93002/">https://habr.com/ru/post/93002/</a></p>
