  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The history of one automation project, or how to implement a mixed accounting of fixed assets with a single tool</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The customer addressed us to the company, which was faced with the task of inventory of the OS.  It would seem that it could be simpler: we take any mobile device on Android, fill in DataMobile Invent software there, cling to ‚Äú1C: Accounting 3.0‚Äù and voila, the problem is solved!  But, as is usually the case, the query ‚Äúwe just need to count and unload it into the register‚Äù has pulled other inventory nuances to the surface.  About how it was, we will tell more in this article. <br><br><img title="The history of OS inventory automation in Chanson Radio" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/hk/d1/en/hkd1ennku6xq4emrmosbkto6i28.png" alt="   "><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Prologue </h2><br>  You may or may not like Chanson Radio, a matter of taste.  But for us, now it‚Äôs not just a radio, but a successfully implemented project on the inventory of fixed assets. <br><br>  A radio station is not a table with a microphone, but a full-fledged working office of an organization with a lot of fixed assets on its balance sheet, including furniture, expensive equipment, and a whole bunch of other things.  The company's accounting department was desperate to receive accounting data accurately and on time, because ‚Äúall sorts of things‚Äù in the office already had about a thousand units spinning, try to count and figure out what is what on a piece of paper.

Sometimes they started, but they never finished (the guys are creative, without a muse in any way).  In a word, musical accounting is so tired of living and raised the question of automation with its edge. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img title="OS inventory automation saves time and effort" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jm/tw/k0/jmtwk0thutbbjcnzv8lgdyxaphs.jpeg" alt="     "></div><br><br><h2>  Scene One: "TZ" </h2><br>  But there was no TZ in general.  There was a task to automate the accounting of the OS, the guys connected with us, looked at the description of our software products on the <a href="http://data-mobile.ru/">data-mobile.ru</a> website, <a href="http://data-mobile.ru/">got in touch with each other</a> , talked.  A couple of letters were enough to understand that our DataMobile Invent product suits them, and we will not reinvent the wheel. <br><br>  <b>Standard functionality of <a href="https://scanport.ru/equipment/programmnoe-obespechenie/po-skanport/DataMobile-Invent/">DataMobile OS inventory</a> is:</b> <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Conducting inventory of fixed assets <br>  ‚Ä¢ Add OS photos <br>  ‚Ä¢ Cancellation of marriage, indicating the reason <br>  ‚Ä¢ Appointment of a materially responsible person (MOL) and premises / storage sites <br>  ‚Ä¢ View the inventory plan in real time, with color designation of active positions <br>  ‚Ä¢ Creating and sending to print labeling labels <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img title="DataMobile Invent software on Android OS" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ne/xg/o_/nexgo_vlmkidrjnx9u-dtyqiqme.png" alt=" DataMobile  "></div><br><br>  The software has an additional RFID module, with which you can add the ability to connect an <a href="https://scanport.ru/equipment/rfid-oborudovanie/mobilnye-schityvateli-rfid/">RFID reader</a> , and then the inventory can be carried out at a distance, by reading RF tags from fixed assets.  And also there is a search functionality for a specific OS and writing a tag to the OS card.  But in our case, such a task was not intended. <br><br><h2>  Scene Two: "Marking of fixed assets from 1C" </h2><br>  Automation of barcode accounting always starts with labeling.  We recommended the <a href="https://scanport.ru/equipment/printery-pechati-strih-koda/printery-nastolnogo-klassa/TSC%2520TX200/">TSC TX200 label printer</a> .  The printer is designed for thermal transfer printing, which is important for the inventory, because the labels must be properly printed and retain their characteristics for a long time, do not fade and not be erased. <br><br>  To automate the labeling process, we used 1C processing, which allowed <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ upload data to TSD (MOLS, premises, OS) <br>  ‚Ä¢ form labels for printing <br>  ‚Ä¢ load data from TSD, creating inventory documents <br>  ‚Ä¢ automatically make transfers and decommissioning when necessary <br><br>  Below is an example of such processing and label layout: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img title="Processing in 1C for marking OS" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/eg/eb/ox/egeboxgl88vbdsgrzqrjygp_h9e.png"></div><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img title="Processing in 1C for marking OS" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xv/se/sn/xvsesnxz7wbpmqa2be6xmvk_0vs.png"></div><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img title="Processing in 1C for marking OS" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/v-/he/4y/v-he4ywewvib-stdetcnt3kif2o.png"></div><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img title="Label for labeling fixed assets" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/in/t0/-a/int0-aivzlptkh9-2_o8igyuucm.png"></div><br><br><h2>  Scene Three: ‚ÄúMobile Inventory Device‚Äù </h2><br>  You could even use a phone with <a href="http://data-mobile.ru/">DataMobile</a> software to <a href="http://data-mobile.ru/">read barcodes</a> , but there was a question of promptness; after all, the amount of work was not small and nobody wanted to scan before the second coming.  Without hesitation, they decided to purchase a mobile <a href="https://scanport.ru/equipment/terminaly-sbora-dannyx/">data collection terminal</a> .  TSD scans barcodes incomparably faster and is intended for corporate use.  The device picked up a budget and fresh - then he just appeared on the market - <a href="https://scanport.ru/equipment/terminaly-sbora-dannyx/terminaly-korporativnogo-klassa/Honeywell%2520EDA50/">Honeywell EDA50</a> .  Despite the low price, stuffing it allows you to quickly and easily process a large amount of information.  TSA EDA50 runs on Android OS, has a large touch screen and a protected case. <br>  In the office of the radio station there is no single WiFi network, there are various remote premises, soundproofing studios, etc.  However, this is not a problem for our software, it does not need a WiFi network everywhere.  The TSD loads data into itself and performs an inventory, and upon subsequent connection to the network or PC unloads it.  Everything is simple and convenient. <br><br><img title="For the inventory of the OS, it is convenient to use the Honeywell mobile computer." src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/-o/kd/lc/-okdlcd9hit8hm-xrtyu4aw-bwu.jpeg" alt="    Honeywell  "><br><br><h2>  Scene Four, Typical: ‚ÄúWe here remembered that we forgot‚Äù </h2><br>  The customer purchased the necessary equipment and software license, delivered our processing for 1C, marked the property.  <a href="http://data-mobile.ru/datamobile-inventory/">Dealing</a> with <a href="http://data-mobile.ru/datamobile-inventory/">DataMobile Invent</a> for kids was not difficult.  The software is intuitive for the user and ready to work, all instructions are available, integration into basic configurations takes a matter of minutes.  For additional questions we have an <a href="http://data-mobile.ru/helpdesk/">online help-desk</a> .  In short, everything went like clockwork. <br><br>  But about a month later, their IT specialist contacts us and says that new radio accounts have appeared in the radio accounting department.  The company is still registered with low-value fixed assets (computer mice, keyboards, etc.).  Usually, they are already labeled with factory barcodes, and how to get them into the contour of the inventory process with DataMobile Invent was not entirely clear.  The low estimate is taken into account quite differently, it has its own bar codes, it implies the input of the quantity (and this is the specificity of the commodity accounting), in the accounting department for it are completely different accounting documents. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img title="And here we remembered that we need to take into account the low price in the OS inventory" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wf/l7/hx/wfl7hx-q2ytmr1-bwi8f3c7wods.png"></div><br><h2>  Scene Five: "Any whim for your money" </h2><br>  It was necessary to adapt the processing of the exchange with 1c for marking ‚Äúlow prices‚Äù and loading the result into a regular inventory document.  It also required the program to understand such positions and process it differently.  Our developers quickly implemented this refinement in the base program. <br><br>  In the software package, a revision was implemented, in which operating systems with certain attributes (for example, ‚Äúlow-value ones‚Äù) were distributed to separate directories.  When <a href="https://scanport.ru/equipment/terminaly-sbora-dannyx/">uploading a</a> document for recalculation on the <a href="https://scanport.ru/equipment/terminaly-sbora-dannyx/">TSD</a> , the refinement in DataMobile Invent software made it possible to understand that if this is an object with a ‚Äúlow score‚Äù attribute, then the quantity input for this item is available.  If the item was from the list of normal operating systems, then the input quantity in the mobile application remained inactive. <br>  After the inventory, when uploading the results to 1C, the revision by 1C automatically distributed everything to the relevant documents in accordance with the type of OS: <br><br><ul><li> filling in various documents of the inventory of the type of OS </li><li>  relocation or withdrawal documents, depending on the type of OS </li></ul><br>  A week later, with the help of <a href="http://data-mobile.ru/datamobile-inventory/">DataMobile Invent, the</a> client was able to start working with "low-value" OS.  The entire accounting of goods and materials became possible to maintain centrally with the help of one program, and load the result into the necessary accounting documents.  Just magic! <br><br><h2>  Epilogue </h2><br>  As a result, the customer received a means of operational accounting of fixed assets, including low-value ones, using a single software tool.  The term of launching a fully automated inventory process from scratch, taking into account all the necessary improvements to the needs of the client - 1 month. <br><br>  How convenient it is for the company, and what the customer himself says, see in the video about the project: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2VeYHDi3wgI" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/350340/">https://habr.com/ru/post/350340/</a></p>
