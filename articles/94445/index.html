In developing a new model, the ThinkPad T410, Lenovo tried to improve all the main features.  In addition to powerful hardware stuffing with Intel Core i-series processors, the touchpad area has increased in the updated laptop, which now supports MultiTouch mode, support for the Gobi 2000 3G module, and improved battery life.  Especially for the T-series was developed a new extended battery, providing up to 22 hours of work away from power outlets! <br><br>  In this article, I will describe in detail the updated ThinkPad T410.  However, you yourself can become its owner by taking part in <a href="http://www.lenovoap.com/refresh/russia/">the</a> Lenovo <a href="http://www.lenovoap.com/refresh/russia/">competition</a> .  The conditions are simple: you need to go to the contest page and tell you exactly how you are going to use your new ThinkPad, how it can be useful to you.  The contest will last until the end of June, the results will be announced in July, and the winner will be the author of the most original story.  Dare! <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/daa/7d1/ee6/daa7d1ee6b452f139759b3b9e6eeabb9.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Performance</b> <br><br>  ThinkPad T410 is available in versions with Intel Core i3, i5 and i7 processors.  The version with powerful processors Core i7 provides maximum performance, while models with Core i5 offer the best balance of performance and battery life.  These processors support Intel Turbo Boost technology: for example, a laptop with an Intel Core i5-520M has a nominal frequency of 2.4 GHz, but can automatically ‚Äúaccelerate‚Äù to 2.93 GHz.  "Overclocking" is actively used during operation, but this feature can be turned off when switching to autonomous power. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/713/171/959/7131719593b8646cb2686ba91bb747bc.jpg"><br><br>  Intel Core i3 does not support Turbo Boost technology, but it is a very powerful processor, defeating the previous generation Core 2 Duo for all tests.  In the minimum power consumption mode, the frequency of the Intel Core i3-330M processor varies between 1.1-1.3 GHz with a standard 2.13 GHz.  In practice, this allows you to work not only with office documents, but also watch videos, load a laptop with rather heavy tasks ‚Äî with a record long battery life! <br><br>  <b>Universal connector set</b> <br><br>  ThinkPad T410 is equipped with the highest possible set of ports for connecting external devices.  The standard for the T-series models (and some other ThinkPad) has become the DisplayPort interface for connecting an external display.  If necessary, the monitor can be connected using a DVI or HDMI cable using an adapter.  To the usual 4 USB ports (one of them is constantly powered, even when the laptop is turned off), eSata and FireWire mini connectors are added.  Optional modules can also be installed in the 34 mm Express Card slot. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ab1/747/1b1/ab17471b15b59c21f45de001619c1725.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/88a/182/9dc/88a1829dc31a0572d905a1831f4a0b3c.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Reliability</b> <br><br>  The cover of the ThinkPad T410 is equipped with a stiffness frame made of highly elastic polycarbonate (HEPC), and the motherboard and hard disk protects the frame from magnesium alloy.  The keyboard is protected from moisture: the liquid spilled on the keys is removed from the laptop through special channels without affecting the electronic components.  And, of course, ThinkPad T410 is equipped with the legendary brand keyboard, which guarantees incredible comfort when typing. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/dd0/2c4/601/dd02c4601148bedf91673e9c0d0e7510.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Battery life</b> <br><br>  The T410 is one of the most suitable laptops for long battery life.  You can buy a laptop with ordinary batteries with 4 and 6 cells.  With a 6-cell battery, a laptop based on an Intel Core i5 processor will work for about 6.6 hours - not bad!  The expanded 9-cell battery, which can be purchased separately, provides 11 hours of work on a single charge.  But that's not all: a special battery with prismatic elements was developed for the new ThinkPad T series of laptops. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cdd/3d7/dc0/cdd3d7dc0b9abe3b4d0a93ddb13202c5.jpg"><br><br>  Such a battery connects to the dock connector on the bottom of the laptop and can be used in conjunction with a standard battery.  As a result, with two 9-cell batteries at the same time, the laptop will work without charging a record 22 hours - almost a day.  What is important, both batteries will be charged at the same time - there is no need to rearrange the batteries or buy an external charger. <br><br>  Finally, the ThinkPad T410, like any other T-series notebook, is a complete freedom of choice.  The modular design allows you to expand the possibilities of the laptop.  For example, you can replace the built-in DVD-drive with another 2.5-inch hard drive installed in a special adapter.  The corporate layout of the Fn key to the left of Ctrl mentioned in the discussions can be changed in the BIOS more than once. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/145/bf5/bd3/145bf5bd3d038b59b664c22a5791fe30.jpg"><br><br>  You can connect your laptop to a proprietary docking station, making it your only computer for office and travel.  All the attributes of a desktop PC ‚Äî an external monitor, a keyboard and a mouse ‚Äî can be permanently connected to the port replicator itself.  And the laptop can be connected and disconnected to the updated docking stations almost instantly: in previous models it was necessary to wait for the ports to turn off.  And with a powerful Intel Core i5, the performance will be close to the ‚Äúdesktop one‚Äù - here we are talking not only about the office, but also much more ‚Äúvoracious‚Äù programs. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e39/0dd/db9/e390dddb9432f858fff415ae3ed641f9.jpg"><br><br>  In conclusion, I want to talk about a close relative of the ThinkPad T410 - the T410s model.  It is just as powerful a laptop, but much thinner and lighter: the use of a magnesium alloy and glass-fiber reinforced carcass in the model made it possible to reduce the weight of the model from 2.27 kg (T410) to 1.79 kg (T410s).  One of the unusual features of this model is the optional touch screen with MultiTouch support.  Both models will be tested in the near future, and I will talk about them in the Lenovo blog in detail. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/94445/">https://habr.com/ru/post/94445/</a></p>
