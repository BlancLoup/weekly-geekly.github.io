At the same time, the entire infrastructure actually "belongs" to one enterprise.  Therefore, it is more correct to speak here about a hybrid information system.  In the article we will help to understand the terminology and understand what is related to what. </li></ul><br><ul><li>  <b><a href="https://1cloud.ru/blog/sozdanie-virtualnoj-mashiny-v-oblake%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr%26utm_medium%3Dcpm%26utm_campaign%3Dit-infrastructure%26utm_content%3Dblog">How to quickly ‚Äúmove to the cloud‚Äù: basic examples, terms and utilities</a></b> .  Here we provide an introductory material on how to transfer an already working server to the cloud with the help of a minimum number of manipulations.  We say in simple words how exactly to carry out such a ‚Äútransfer‚Äù, what the virtual machine will help in this case, and what formats of virtual disks you need to be familiar with.  In addition to this - we are talking about utilities for creating virtual disks in Windows and Linux. </li></ul><br><ul><li>  <b><a href="https://cloudplatform.googleblog.com/2017/10/turns-out-security-drives-cloud-adoption-not-the-other-way-around.html">Why trust is the main growth driver of the virtual infrastructure market</a></b> .  The main idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe English-language material is that more and more companies use the virtual infrastructure in their work.  A critical factor is the growth of confidence in the security level of solutions offered by IaaS providers.  This trend is confirmed by a study of Google Cloud and MIT.  About him - read the article. </li></ul><br><ul><li>  <b><a href="https://zen.yandex.ru/media/id/5a8d66d828c6a1237a7f54ce/lichnyi-opyt-chto-iaasprovaider-mojet-predlojit-franchaizi-1s-5a90507248c85e4fe5f18ce1">How IaaS helps 1C franchisee: 1cloud experience</a></b> .  According <a href="https://www.rbc.ru/newspaper/2017/03/07/58bd26e09a7947cd79814830">to</a> RBC <a href="https://www.rbc.ru/newspaper/2017/03/07/58bd26e09a7947cd79814830">data</a> for 2016, 1C heads the top 50 most popular franchises in Russia.  However, in 2013, the franchise holder tightened the requirements for franchisees, which is why small organizations were forced to terminate their partnership with 1C.  In this material, we talk about what such companies have to face: from competitors with a dubious reputation to outright dumping.  As a case - we share the opinion of the company Unitek24.  Her representative talks about three principles that have allowed the organization to win and maintain the reputation of a bona fide 1C franchisee through the active use of the infrastructure of an IaaS provider. </li></ul><br><ul><li>  <b><a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/1cloud/blog/341866/">‚ÄúHouston, we have problems‚Äù: what difficulties of web studios will help the hosting provider to understand</a></b> .  According <a href="http://www.cossa.ru/149/155988/">to</a> CMS Magazine, the size of the web studio market is reduced by a million rubles a year.  In this article we will examine a number of problems faced by companies in this industry: from requests for non-core services to the lack of "availability" of resources.  As possible solutions, we will consider those that can be implemented in partnership with an IaaS provider. </li></ul><br><ul><li>  <b><a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/1cloud/blog/343198/">How IaaS and SaaS technologies change the field of education</a></b> .  Entrepreneur <a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/279365">declares</a> that traditional education does not prepare children for "future professions".  How much truth is in this statement, and what are the alternatives to the classical approach to learning?  We are talking about how IaaS helps launch and support new products in this area.  For example, MOOC and School in the Cloud.  Also, using real examples, we find out what practical results ‚Äúeducation in the cloud‚Äù helps to achieve. </li></ul><br><ul><li>  <b><a href="https://1cloud.ru/blog/komputerny-class-v-oblake%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr%26utm_medium%3Dcpm%26utm_campaign%3Dit-infrastructure%26utm_content%3Dblog">Why do we need a virtual infrastructure for classrooms</a></b> .  In continuation of the educational topic in this material we will discuss why creating a ‚Äúvirtual classroom‚Äù.  We define the advantages of working with the cloud and compare the classic approach with the new one according to the following criteria: operational efficiency, maintenance costs and licensed software.  In addition, we will talk about additional features of the virtual class: disk snapshots, creating templates, automating routine actions (for example, creating / deleting servers) and automatically shutting down computers. </li></ul><br><h2>  Load Planning and Resource Allocation </h2><br><ul><li>  <b><a href="https://1cloud.ru/blog/skrytye-poteri-v-oblachnoj-infrastrukture%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr%26utm_medium%3Dcpm%26utm_campaign%3Dit-infrastructure%26utm_content%3Dblog">What is the cause of extra spending in the cloud, and how to reduce them</a></b> .  This material will focus on the efficient use of resources.  According to analytical data, the size of direct losses from payment for unused cloud resources varies from 30 to 45%, and the cause of indirect losses can be, for example, fluctuations in the load on the infrastructure.  The article will explain how to reduce and optimize costs, and what tools offer IaaS providers for this. </li></ul><br><ul><li>  <b><a href="https://1cloud.ru/blog/sravnenie-stoimosti-tipov-serverov%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr%26utm_medium%3Dcpm%26utm_campaign%3Dit-infrastructure%26utm_content%3Dblog">Virtual and physical server: cost comparison</a></b> .

When predicting system performance, a number of difficulties arise: for example, the load may for some reason increase or decrease dramatically (and lead to unnecessary downtime of equipment).  Balancing will help minimize these difficulties.  In the article we will explain with concrete examples what the difference is between different load distribution options: static, dynamic and pseudo-dynamic. </li></ul><br><ul><li>  <b><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Resource-Central-SOSP17.pdf">Resource Central: load balancing on virtual infrastructure</a></b> .  The authors of this study state that it is unique because it describes for the first time the characteristics of the workloads of the virtual machines of large cloud providers.  The focus of the research is on the Resource Central system, which collects telemetry data and analyzes the results.  The study is a living example of work on load balancing with elements of machine learning. </li></ul><br><h2>  Data storage </h2><br><ul><li>  <b><a href="https://1cloud.ru/blog/obektnoe-hranilishe%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr%26utm_medium%3Dcpm%26utm_campaign%3Dit-infrastructure%26utm_content%3Dblog">What you need object storage files in the cloud</a></b> .
