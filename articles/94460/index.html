  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Yakut turtle</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <i><b>Although information technologies are quite developed in Yakutia (at least in comparison with the neighboring Russian regions, the situation in this area looks good), the Sakhayazic Internet occupies rather modest positions.</b></i> <br>  In the courtyard of the Internet age. <br>  A modern urbanized person can no longer imagine himself and his life without such means of communication as a mobile phone, laptop or desktop connected to the web. <br>  All sorts of sources (for example, public opinion polls of the SakhaInternet company, Report <a href="http://www.fapmc.ru/files/download/Print.pdf">‚ÄúThe Internet in Russia‚Äù</a> ) assert that Yakutsk, by the level of Internet penetration, is in strong middling among the cities of Russia.  But for some reason, the development of the Sakhayan segment of the Internet is stalling. <br>  Of course, one can nod at the vertical of power, disapprovingly looking at the development of the whole national, suspicious sprout of separatism (separation) suspicious of any manifestation of ethnic self-awareness, as a result of which the national segments of the Internet are probably viewed as an environment feeding anti-Russian forces or worse than extremists (people trying to solve their problems with the help of illegitimate power). <a name="habracut"></a>  Let's leave this case on the conscience of politicians and politicians. <br>  And let us ask ourselves the question: But is it only the lack of support from the state that is responsible for the fact that Sakhanet is developing at a snail's pace? <br><br><h5>  Overview </h5><br>  In order to at least superficially imagine the situation, we will make a small review. <br>  In the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia) about a million inhabitants.  About 450 thousand of them are ethnic <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25AF%25D0%25BA%25D1%2583%25D1%2582%25D1%258B">Yakuts</a> .  Of these, all the villagers (200 thousand) and most of the citizens speak their native language (let it be 150 thousand, well, let it be even 100 thousand).  Total 300 thousand.  Of these, about 25% are young children, about 25% are elderly.  Exclude them.  Remains 150 thousand. <br>  Why are these tens of thousands of people do not go into the network, do not write in Yakut?  Yes, simply because communication, even in the cities of Yakutia, is expensive.  And since in the village it is even more expensive, and technically it still has not reached every village (Yakut settlement), 80% of villagers can be safely crossed out. <br>  In this case, according to the most conservative estimates, 70 thousand Yakuts have the opportunity to access the Internet.  Albeit at a high price.  Well, where are they? <br>  A small illustrative example.  During the two years of the existence of <a href="http://sah.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A1%25D2%25AF%25D1%2580%25D2%25AF%25D0%25BD_%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D1%2580%25D1%258D%25D0%25B9">Sakha Wikipedia</a> , a little over 6 thousand articles appeared in it.  Actively participate no more than 50 people.  Why so little?  Yes, if all 70,000 would have written one article per month, she would have long been in the lead, if not in the world, then among the Russian and CIS wiki for sure!  Well, let these people write one single article, well, or every second, and let them write this one single article for a whole year.  For two years, it would still have scored 70 thousand articles. <br>  Ok wikipedia.  Let them not write.  Still, a specific resource.  Not everyone is so active, has the courage and time to make edits there, and even more so to create new articles.  But not many people read Sakhayan-language resources!  Take the most popular Yakut newspaper <a href="http://www.kyym.ru/">"Kyym"</a> , which has a circulation of more than 34 thousand copies (by the way, the record holder of Russia among non-Russian periodicals with the circulation confirmed by the National Circulation Service).  So, considering that at least 50 thousand people read it (several readers of different generations can read a newspaper in a family).  But her <a href="http://www.kyym.ru/">website</a> , which until recently had represented a copy of a paper publication (the concept has now been changed, and it has become essentially the portal of the same name), only 30-80 people visited a day.  Now attendance reaches 500 clicks (not hosts) per day.  How to explain such a small popularity of web resources? <br><br><h5>  Possible reasons </h5><br>  This lag is explained, apparently, only by two reasons. <br>  1. The Yakut village still ‚Äúdid not reach‚Äù the Internet. <br>  2. Young people, who occupy the lion‚Äôs share of the Internet population, do not have the habit of learning, communicating, working with the help and through their native language, including on the web. <br>  The first reason, as well as bad roads and the second misfortune of Russia, we all know, cannot cope without a state.  Therefore, the ‚Äúquality‚Äù will have to focus on the second - the lack of appropriate skills and habits among Yakut users.
