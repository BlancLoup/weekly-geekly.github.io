  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Choosing a microcontroller together</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  After reading <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/controllers/120611/">this article,</a> I noticed a great interest in choosing a microcontroller from readers and decided to look at this problem from the other side. <br>  I can assume that everyone is interested in the choice of their <i>first</i> , or the first 32-bit MK. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/785/1b0/73f/7851b073ffa4dfb2eaa37e867701dfa5.jpg" alt="image"><br>  For those who know that there is not a single microcontroller in the photo - I ask in the commentary to add my story and thus share my experience with beginners.  The rest, certainly under the cat! <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  In my opinion, the simpler each stage of learning will be - the easier it will be to reach independent swimming.  Therefore, I believe that at the initial stage everything should be taken ready.  Do not invent anything yourself.  Imagine: <br>  you chose a controller <br>  overlooked the datasheet <br>  made a fee under it <br>  or found it on the Internet, <br>  bought all the components (or if there were no analogs), <br>  soldered everything <br>  wrote the first "hello world", <br>  assembled the programmer, asked the controller <br><br>  And ... and nothing happens!  Something does not work, and you cannot understand what: either there is an error in the soldering, or something with the program, or there is a curved scheme on the Internet, or there are problems with the software.

      Novice such a situation baffled, I know it on my own. <br>  To prevent this from happening, the easiest way is to take the first steps under someone else‚Äôs guidance. <br><br>  The advantage of a simple start perfectly shows the Arduino platform.  Judge for yourself: the capabilities of the controllers are far from great, the prices of the boards are huge, but there is a huge support from the community and everything is ready, any expansion cards, heaps of examples. <br>  Due to this, the platform lives! <br><br>  Let's see what choice we have at all!  On the market a huge number of manufacturers and architectures.  But the choice is really <b>not great at all</b> : <br>  I would immediately cut off all 8-bit and 16-bit architectures, except PIC and AVR, and sometimes manufacturers offer debug boards and controllers at a <a href="http://e2e.ti.com/group/msp430launchpad/w/default.aspx">very attractive price.</a> <br>  but I do not advise taking them because these are uncommon architectures and there are fewer examples for them + it will be more difficult to change to other controllers. <br>  For the same reason, all 32-bit architectures except ARM + are cut off, problems with examples still begin with them, and they are gradually dying out. <br><br>  Arm microcontrollers are divided into ARM7, ARM9, Cortex M0, 3, 4. <br>  The seventh and ninths are gradually being replaced by cortex, and soon they will not be either. <br><br>  Total we have: <br>  AVR <br>  Pic <br>  ARM Cortex <br><br>  I can‚Äôt say a lot about the peaks, but in my opinion the AVR displaces them due to the prevalence of Arduino. <br>  But I still advised Cortex, their possibilities are much wider, besides there is a choice between manufacturers, and this, in my opinion, is a big plus.  And there are a lot of libraries that simplify life and even code generators that will allow beginners to not read the user manual much to write the first program. <br><br>  So which manufacturers are represented by us? <br>  NXP, ST, Freescale, TI, Luminary Micro, Atmel and many others but less common. <br><br>  How to choose from so many manufacturers? <br>  you must choose not a controller, but a debug board, libraries, development environment and community. <br><br>  He himself felt only NXP, ST and Freescale. <br><br>  The first 2 manufacturers flooded Moscow and other cities of Russia with cheap / free debugs - this is very good in the sense that there is always someone to ask, who to contact. <br>  Also, no programmers are needed - everything is on board! <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/de5/dfc/abd/de5dfcabd2f6a123c0b968dd0aad5820.png" alt="image"><br><img src="http://www.freertos.org/shop/images/LPCXpresso.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  For NXP there is an alternative from Olimex <a href="http://www.chipdip.ru/product/lpc-p1343.aspx">www.chipdip.ru/product/lpc-p1343.aspx</a> <br>  There are also disadvantages: when you want to expand their opportunities, you will have to look for a new one. <br><br>  Most of all I liked the patching from Freescale, which I encountered at work. <br>  In my opinion, this is the best option for a newbie, but she has one huge minus: <br>  it is still quite difficult to find on sale and the regions will have to order, but it's worth it: <br>  The first and most important advantage: standard expansion cards (first buy a standard set, then re-buy Wi-Fi, sensors, etc.) <br><img src="http://freescalehome.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/fig-1-1the-kinetis-kwikstik-development-tool.jpg?w=370&amp;h=200" alt="image"><br><img src="http://freescalehome.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/figure-1-2-the-kinetis-kwikstik-development-tool.jpg?w=372&amp;h=190" alt="image"><br><br>  Another big plus is the development environment: thanks to Processor Expert, you can generate code, and lots of examples with explanations. <br><br>  So let's summarize: <br><br>  1 to buy Arduino Uno with AVR for 1000r on the board is almost nothing, but in the sale of many expansion cards and a huge community <br><br>  2 to buy STM32L-DISCOVERY with M3 for 16.22 dollars with touch buttons, USB and a small LCD display and debager on board <br><br>  3 buy for 1000r LPCEXPRESSO c M3 with just pulled out contacts and debager on board <br><br>  4 buy KWIKSTICK with M4 for 30dol + delivery with a large segment LCD, USB, headphone input, speaker, touch buttons, lithium battery, microphone, IR port, SD card slot + ability to expand functionality without soldering and large investments.  A large set of libraries, examples and a good IDE. <br><br>  In the end, I believe that you need to buy STM32L-DISCOVERY and start with it, <br>  or if you are not too lazy to bother with the order of the board and pay a little more to take KWIKSTICK - it will be easier to start with, and it will last longer, but you need English to communicate with colleagues. <br><br>  I ask everyone familiar with the MK to write my choice of debugging tools for a newbie, I will gladly add an article <br><br>  UPD: stm32l-discovery at such prices you can buy in Kompela <br>  Kwikstick on freescale </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/122030/">https://habr.com/ru/post/122030/</a></p>
