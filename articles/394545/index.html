And in particular about the campaign to reprint this cult book.  Almost 500 people have already been noted on the pre-order form, the coverage is amazing - cities from Kaliningrad to Sakhalin.  From Canada and the USA.  From Estonian Tallinn.  Kiev, Kharkov.  Minsk.  Vilnius.  Several applications from Kazakhstan. <br><br>  And in particular, some reviews: <br><br>  " <i>I read several times and each time I discovered something new. Even after the art of circuit engineering, which is essentially a university textbook, it was instructive to reread Step by Step. How it affected me: I started as an electronics engineer, but now I work DSP ‚ÄúProgrammer. If I hadn‚Äôt read it and grabbed her spirit, I‚Äôd hardly become a developer. Thanks to this book, I was inspired by the value system of engineers and became an engineer.</i> "

And for those who have not read the book - it would be interesting to know <b>what is so special about this book</b> that she was able to unite so many people? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  <b>Igor, Moscow</b> </h5><br><img width="300" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/files/81e/fcd/ef2/81efcdef2af345488632567e88ac634f.jpg">  My name is Igor.  I live in the Moscow region, in the city of Chekhov.  I work as a programmer in Moscow.  Of all the hobbies, there are only computers left: assemble / disassemble, configure and program a little. <br><br>  This red book has always been on my bookshelf.  At least when I learned to read.  Those.  I do not remember that they gave it to me or presented it to me somehow.  My father was fond of amateur radio and I could not stand aside when my dad was soldering something there.  Apparently, this book was bought to familiarize me with this world. <br><br>  Before I went to the radio circle at school, I collected various schemes from radio designers, mainly receivers.  From early achievements - added to the radio from the designer circuit, which lights the LED at a critical battery level.  Scheme peeped in the factory radio.  And when he began to go to the radio club, he twice took gold at a competition that was held in the city house of creativity. <br><br>  He even sold one of his projects to a classmate - a VHF radio.  Everything was assembled from modules: some were released as assembly kits, others were taken ready.  In particular, the settings were set using an eight-channel electronic tuning unit from the TV.  In my opinion there was even a remote. <br><br>  The first impressions of the book are entertaining illustrations.  Together with a clear presentation of the material.  Understandable even schoolchild. <br><br>  Actually this book taught me electronics.  Some time ago, I realized that for me, both programming and electronics are just another kind of children's constructor.  If I were born before the age of 20-30, I would most likely be somehow connected with electronics. <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Continuation</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  This book also taught me not to be afraid of electronics.  Now basically I collect everything from ready-made modules.  And since now in most devices we have microcontrollers, then we can create more in programming than in electronics. <br><br>  Of course for the younger generation need a similar book.  Especially talk about vacuum devices is no longer worth it, but to add something modern is definitely worth it.  But I don‚Äôt know if it is worth including a detailed review of microcontrollers.  It is imperative to turn on the technique of working with mockups - it seems to me that the current generation wants to quickly get a result;) <br><br>  I will definitely get a reissue - my son has just turned three years old, he will also need to study electronics. </div></div><br><br><h5>  <b>Artem, Nizhny Novgorod</b> </h5><br><img width="300" align="right" src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1e9/11d/7eb/1e911d7ebde24c0faa4442a343e0fb7e.jpg">  Nizhny Novgorod, 26 years old, a programmer, a stern techie. <br><br>  Suddenly it came to the realization that I absolutely do not remember how I first became acquainted with this book!  I have never had my own copy.  All I can remember is that I did not return this book to the library for months, but by returning it for a couple of weeks I took it again.  This piece of paper (calmly, this is a photocopy on a cardboard in scotch) has been around for about 15 years.  And it is better than any Internet (which I did not have) helped to collect the first amplifiers. <br><br>  Is the book out of date?  Partly.  Take at least the section on computers and television.  These sections need to sort out, update.  Weakly imagine how to update the reference section.  But since the laws of electrical engineering are not going to change, the rest of the material will remain relevant. <br><br>  . <br><br><h5>  <b>Timur, St. Petersburg</b> </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0f6/8c4/e85/0f68c4e853c246978bdb06d743385629.jpg"><br>  Hello, Ilya, the book Electronics Step-by-Step certainly influenced me: on the worldview, on the fate in part, on the attitude to work and people.  Here is my story: <br><br>  My name is Timur.  At the moment I live in the city of St. Petersburg.  I work as a DSP engineer.  This abbreviation may not sound very clear, so I will explain in more detail: DSP is digital signal processing.  Previously, the processors were slow and they had little memory, so it was easier to process the signals in an analog way: using voltage dividers, integrating and differentiating chains, transistors, operational amplifiers.  This method had one drawback: each scheme after the installer assembles it - you need to give it to the installer, who will spend some time setting it up.  Now all the equipment works "in digital".  Those.  An analog signal is digitized at the input, then all the transformations over it are done programmatically, and then the result is again converted to analog form (voltage on the smartphone‚Äôs dynamics, pixel brightness on the TV screen, brake caliper force, controlled by an anti-lock system, etc.). ) Digital circuits almost do not need to be adjusted (and if they do, they do it themselves), so they won.  On the one hand, the transition to DSP very sharply reduced the need for people who would understand how electronic circuits work.  On the other hand, when writing programs for signal processors, the understanding of radio electronics is not even superfluous. <br><br>  I grew up in a military family.  Therefore, among friends and comrades of my father there were people who are knowledgeable in radio electronics.  Since my five years probably, my dad bought me radio designers, books on electronics, we tried to solder something with him, although it didn't work out very well - he was not an electronic engineer or an avid amateur radio ... At that time (late 80s) we lived in a military town and a shop where we would not sell radio components.  Details were taken from the garbage.  I collected the schemes, but did not understand how they work.  To be precise, I thought I understood.  I could even repeat the word for word explanation from some book.  But I had no real understanding.  Despite the rather large number of accumulated radio components (I‚Äôve been saving up or collecting them rather than collecting something from them) it wasn‚Äôt possible to use them for their intended purpose.  There was always a lack of a resistor, a transistor or a capacitor, as a result, the circuits were half assembled and waited for the right part to appear. <br><br>  At about 14 years old, by chance, while traveling in the city of Izhevsk, while waiting for a train at the railway station, I walked through the lobby and saw a book camber.  If you go to any today's railway station and see what they sell on the collapse of books, you can hardly believe that at that time you could buy ‚ÄúStep-by-Step Electronics‚Äù at the station, nevertheless at that time you could .  So she was with me. <br><br>  Then I began to read it.  Right at the train station, and then on the train.  Despite the fact that it was night.  When I looked at these pictures, where the parts mounted by the mounted assembly were painted, I almost felt the smell of rosin ... Some things that I hadn‚Äôt understood before, as if loading my head with reading a book, like knowledge heroes in the movie "The Matrix". <br><br>  The undoubted advantage of this book is that it can be read as an art book and at the same time absorb the knowledge of the author.  She is kindly unreal and helpful.  For the first time, it was then that the thought occurred to me that when we read, we actually communicate with the author.  Let this communication one-sided.  But on the other hand, this author can be a very rare person, so much so that in real life you will never meet such a person <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Continuation</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  This book, of course, cannot be a full-fledged textbook on radio electronics - but its value is that it is for children.  She teaches several main things that come in handy in any specialty: <br><br>  1) You need to understand what you are doing (in fact, all other areas of knowledge (other than electronics) also require the same, but they sometimes forgive carelessness, incomplete understanding, some kind of laxity - electronics - never). <br><br>  2) At the expense of good structuredness, this book really teaches learning.  Learning to learn - it means learning to critically evaluate your understanding of the material, if necessary, go back to a page, chapter, or several chapters.  It means taking notes in order to return to them later and notice the same facts set forth in different words in different places.  Find some information in other books.  Trying to summarize your understanding on paper, even if in the first approximation it is not true. <br><br>  3) This book teaches good attitude to those who are still taking the first steps, although there are no such statements directly in it.  Rather, it teaches by example, and this is the best motivator. <br><br>  It so happened that my first specialty was not related to electronics and engineering.  After seven years of training in St. Petersburg, I had to go to the place of service, so when I left, I bought books on programming and electronics, because  I was afraid that they would not be available at the place of service.  During the service, I once again re-read "Electronics", then it was "The Art of Circuit Engineering."  Then I assembled a prototype electrocardiograph.  It was a device that uses the so-called instrumental operational amplifier to amplify signals from the leads, the amplified signal was fed to the input of the ADC built into the microcontroller.  In the microcontroller there was a simplest program written in assembly language (for which you did not have to pay anything, unlike compilers for the C language).  This program measured the data at the ADC input and sent them to the COM port.  From the COM port, the data was transferred via cable to a computer running a program written in Delphi, which built an ECG graph on the screen. <br><br>  For me, this work was analogous to a thesis or term paper for engineering students.  Everything was done from beginning to end.  I looked at the analog part, of course, but then I found a data sheet on an instrumentation amplifier chip and realized that what I looked at was taken from there (that is, it was not plagiarism, but normal use of information sources).  After I retired from the Armed Forces, I decided to try myself as an electronics engineer and ... I did it!  2 years I worked on this specialty and during this time I developed several products that went into the series (they were fire alarm systems, but they were not so simple - there was their own analog part, moreover, I even invented one clever trick that allowed It is simple, correct and with minimal losses to operate the battery alarm controller with a gradually decreasing supply voltage (before me, all circuits had special voltage regulators, which, firstly, they took part of the battery voltage themselves,  secondly, these were extra details, which means extra labor costs for installers and service engineers. For all these two years, my main books were ‚ÄúElectronics ...‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Art of Circuit Engineering‚Äù. <br><br>  Then I began to develop in the direction of the so-called.  embedded-development, and then completely went to DSP (DSP).  I constantly felt that in spite of the fact that knowledge of radio electronics was becoming less and less relevant (nothing needed to be collected, everything could be bought), nevertheless, it needed to be ‚Äúmoved to the masses‚Äù.  What for?  Because people who understand electronics are other people.  They have models in their brains that allow them to see solutions to some problems that are not directly related to electronics.  Seeing that where another person needs calculations, the electronics engineer will feel the solution intuitively.  What are these tasks or situations?  Well, for example, the electronics engineer understands that the movable knee (the S-shaped pipe from which water flows) does not need to be sealed off the water tap very much, because despite the high pressure in the water pipe, the pressure drop on this last knee is almost zero, which means and near-zero pressure acts on the movable joint, which means that this compound will not flow without sealing.  Or another task: a train is traveling from a long train and two locomotives (front and rear).  Locomotives can not synchronize the speed of movement with each other very accurately.  It turns out that if the front locomotive will go a little faster - it will pull the entire train and the rear locomotive.  Or vice versa, if the rear locomotive will go a little faster - it will push the entire train along with the front locomotive.  The question arises, why do we need 2 locomotives, if one of them will always be a burden?  An electronic engineer familiar with the concepts of ‚Äúcurrent source‚Äù and ‚Äúvoltage source‚Äù will immediately say that each of the locomotives is not a pure ‚Äúsource of speed‚Äù.  Those.  The speed of the locomotive will directly depend on the number of cars that it pushes or pulls, respectively, as soon as the first locomotive starts pulling all the cars, it will become heavily loaded and will go slower than the speed of the second locomotive, which means the second locomotive will start pushing, but only as long as he does not take on a sufficient number of cars;  The electronics engineer will also certainly notice that one car in the middle will hang out, turning out to be in the state when it is pulled by the first locomotive, then in the state when it is pushed by the second one. <br><br>  Such analogies between real life and electronics are the sea.  And the difference between an electronics engineer is that where an ordinary person scratches his head and tries to understand what will happen, the electronics engineer will be able to see the analogy and already see the full picture of how it will evolve over time. <br><br><img width="300" align="right" title="Timur.  This is on Mount Tallak on Lake Tahoe." src="https://habrastorage.org/files/41f/046/ccb/41f046ccb77c412ea5bd840e7c91f674.jpg">  Then I returned to St. Petersburg as an engineer.  Often the work of an embedded programmer required something to be soldered or to use some device (tester, oscilloscope), so knowledge of radio electronics was useful and when I started working as a programmer (oddly enough, using an oscilloscope you can very clearly debug synchronization between threads in multithreaded applications running on a microcontroller that has I / O ports). <br><br>  Once I learned that a movement called FabLab began to develop in St. Petersburg: these are such workshops where there is some equipment and everyone can do something about it.  As part of one of these fab labs, I spent several lessons on electronics (seemingly 9 turned out).  We even made a group back then (here it is: <a href="https://vk.com/fabelectronics">vk.com/fabelectronics</a> - there are some presentations and materials here (by the way, I added a file with the book ‚ÄúStep by Step Electronics‚Äù and recommended it to everyone who went to class). Unfortunately, in reality, it turned out that organizing, preparing and conducting classes take a lot of time, so at that time I limited myself to one course, although I hope that in the future I can sometime teach radio electronics to those who would be interested. <br><br>  I have already written a lot of things ... I do not know what format you will have.  Therefore, I will answer briefly to the other questions that were asked: <br><br>  - As you first learned about the book Svorenya, how it came into your hands - Railway station of the city of Izhevsk. <br>  - I have already described the first impressions of the book, I will write again: the most pleasant ones. <br>  - How she influenced your life - changed profession, eventually became an engineer - i.e.  can be said that strongly enough. <br>  - What is special about the book in your opinion is the feeling that you are not reading a book, but are talking to a living person. <br>  - What do you think the book gives the reader?  - teaches accuracy, accuracy in thinking, kindness, oddly enough. <br>  - Do you use the book now at work?  - I do not use it in my work, but I used it as a textbook for those who went to classes in radio electronics. <br>  - In your opinion, in our time - is this book outdated, how can it be useful? <br>  for the younger generation?  From what age could it be read? <br>  Very difficult question.  To answer it, one should start grumbling that the current generation is not the same.  But this grumbling does not help.  I would say this: you can start reading a book from 7-8 years old, but since a modern teenager is spoiled by various results of the achievements of this very radio electronics, it is necessary to supply the book with a radio designer of the ‚ÄúConnoisseur‚Äù or ‚ÄúSnap-Circuits‚Äù type.  I personally prefer the type designer of the Soviet EKON-03, but, unfortunately, it is no longer produced.  I began to make an analogue of this constructor, trying to cross the idea embodied in Snap-Circuits (a visual representation of the circuit with a plus bus at the top and earthen below) and the idea embedded in EKON-03 (spring connections, allowing to connect the contact with any number of other contacts without soldering ).  But far from being advanced, because  the springs were not cheap, but they need a lot.  In the extreme case, we can recommend the purchase of a modern ‚ÄúWishboard‚Äù mock-up board, although, as practice has shown, this card‚Äôs contacts do not always turn out to be good and the circuit can malfunction even if correctly assembled. <br><br>  About what could be added to the book or improved: it would be nice to explain what current sources and voltage sources are, what current mirrors are, what operational amplifiers are and how they can be used and why they are better than transistors.  It would be nice to explain what optocouplers are.  A little talk about microcontrollers and explain what it means that the leg of the microcontroller works "at the input" and what it means that it works "at the output." </div></div><br><br><h5>  <b>Konstantin, Omsk</b> </h5><br><img align="left" width="300" src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a4f/760/40c/a4f76040c11949f09c2a3f2e977daa8c.jpg">  Hello, my name is Konstantin, I am 27 years old, I live in the city of Omsk, I work as a service engineer in one large company, one of my main hobbies, of course, radio electronics)) <br><br>  The book of Rudolf Anatolyevich came into my hands, you can say casually, and maybe not very casually, who knows.  As a child, I was always drawn to all sorts of glands, something to twist, something to disassemble, see how it works, so that all my toys sooner or later turned into a bunch of spare parts)) Years to 12 my interests from ‚Äúlearning‚Äù toys smoothly moved into the area of ‚Äã‚Äãsomething ‚Äúelectric‚Äù, probably because the father‚Äôs soldering iron and a handful of some kind of electrical trash from the grandfather (he was an aircraft technician) was found in the house.  I twisted these wires, connected some kind of light bulbs to the batteries, poked up motors, poked around, tried to understand something)) And then one day my father told me "that you just twist these wires, you need to learn how to figure it out, let's buy book and you will learn "he himself is not a technician, he is generally a cook by education, so he could not help me))) Some time later we went with him to the bookstore, since then technical literature was still sold in our city, not that that now, and asked the seller to find us a book about electronics, here  thus, I was the proud owner of Rudolf Anatolyevich's book ‚ÄúPractical Encyclopedia of the Young Radio Amateur Electronics Step by Step Edition 4‚Äù <br><br>  At first, I probably, like everyone, wanted to quickly practice, gather something interesting, I began to read the book in pieces, then this section is this, but I quickly realized that this would not work and that I did not understand anything, I had to concentrate and start reading first, delving into every sentence.  I would like to express my gratitude to the author, for his style of presentation and ability to easily convey information to young readers in an easy game form, without this I would probably have thrown all this activity into the far corner)) <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Continuation</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Some time passed, and now I began to slowly understand what voltage is, current strength, resistance, what is a resistor, what is capacitance and a capacitor, learned and understood Ohm's law, slowly got to semiconductors, and my first efficient design, as I remember it was a detector receiver according to the scheme from the book, assembled on a piece of some insulating material and hidden in a blue soap box.  What was my surprise and joy when the loud voice of Radio Russia came from the earpiece dynamics? After the first success, I plunged into my new hobby, my parents gave me a multimeter, and all the pocket money began to go to radio components)) <br><br>  Since then, many other books have flowed under the water, there have been a lot of trial and error, successful and unsuccessful designs, I read this book of Rudolf Anatolyevich, and reread it several times, it allowed me to open the window to the wonderful world of electronics, and decide on the choice of profession, By the end of grade 11, I already knew that I had to connect my life with electronics.  Later, I entered the Omsk Flight Technical College of Civil Aviation for the specialty ‚ÄúTechnical Operation of Radio Electronic Equipment‚Äù successfully completed it in 2009 with two diplomas and has been professionally associated with radio electronics for 7 years, which I did not regret for a minute. <br><br>           ,   ,        ,       ,   ,  ,      ,  .     ,     10-12 <br><br>                        . <br><br>   ,     . <br></div></div><br><br><h5> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Dmitry, Kazan</font></font></b> </h5><br><img align="right" src="https://habrastorage.org/files/442/634/744/44263474443d481d80d439f9e45191d0.jpg">  Hello!<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">My name is Dmitry. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I am 24 years old. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I was born in the city of Kazan, where I still live. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At the moment I am working in the field of unmanned aircraft as a design engineer. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">My fascination with electronics began in 2004, when my uncle presented me with a soldering iron and the book "Electronics step by step" of the 4th edition of 2001. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This book paved my first path into electronics, introduced the alphabet of electronic circuits, inspired and inspired me to further study this area of ‚Äã‚Äãscience.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The greatest value of this book is not only that it provides the basics of complex phenomena, but also that it teaches to reason and think logically, to develop the ingenuity, composure and accuracy in oneself.

However, in my opinion, it should be updated with the new element base, the basics of programming, new approaches and principles for the development of electronic circuits and systems.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I will definitely save this book for my children, but still I really hope for its new reprint. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For all those who dream and wish to plunge into the world of useful and interesting science, this book is priceless. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Thanks Rudolf Anatolevich!</font></font><br><br><h5> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Alexander, Yekaterinburg</font></font></b> </h5><br><img width="300" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4a8/2a1/284/4a82a12843d0446b90102aa3c91da772.jpg"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">From early childhood I was always interested in various techniques and mechanisms. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In my memory, even now certain moments come up, as I fiddled with various techniques, disassembled toys, and collected something new. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I remember at the age of about 3 years watching my father and grandfather sort out a garden hand pump for pumping water. And once I saw that my father dismantled this pump for repair. And I laid out all the details in order to dry. I chose the moment when no one would disturb me, I collected the whole structure. The father was then surprised for a long time that it was me alone who gathered it.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And also, I had an adult second cousin who was fond of electronics at that time. And he always had a lot of interesting things. Disassembled radios, tape recorders, color and sound installations, etc. All these things captivated my weak mind of children. They seemed to be the magical and mysterious fruits of great people - engineers! </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Time passed, the yard was 1990, I was almost 7 years old. Then I dreamed of going to school as soon as possible, because all promised a new interesting and adult life! And at some point I noticed that a new thick book in a red cover had appeared in the bookcase. I glanced through the book and I realized that I had found something for myself in the near future. Though I still couldn‚Äôt really read, the vivid pictures of physical experiments and experiments spoke for themselves.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Initially, I thought my father bought this book for himself. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I thought that it was for adults, so I secretly took it from the closet, climbed under the bed in my room and, under the light of a flashlight, plunged into the world of electronics. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Leafing through the book, I studied the structure of the atom, how current flows in an electrical circuit, how radio waves propagate in the atmosphere of the earth, and how computers are arranged.</font></font><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Continuation</b> <div class="spoiler_text"> ,       ¬´   ¬ª     ¬´ ¬ª  ¬´ ¬ª.          )).        : ‚Äú1 .            .      5- .       ¬´  ¬ª, ¬´ ¬ª, ¬´  ¬ª ‚Ä¶        . ,        ,   ¬´¬ª    .     ,  ,         .         . <br><br> ,        !    ‚Äî           ,       . <br><br>  ,             .    ,     .      .    ,        .     ,      . <br><br>          . <br><br>         ¬´ZX-Spectrum¬ª.         !    1994     Dendy,         .     ,        .      .     . <br><br>  -   ,    Spectrum!      ,      ,     .     ,         ¬´     ZX-Spectrum¬ª.         ¬´ ,   Spectrum¬ª.       ,     . <br><br>             .       ‚Äì  -   ¬´¬ª,    ¬´¬ª.  ,             .         .  -    ,  , - .        ¬´¬ª    ,   .     ,    ,  ,     .     ‚Äî -     ‚Ä¶      -  .      . -                 ,    ,     ,     .        ,  ‚Ä¶   ! <br><br>       ¬´Spectrum¬ª,      .    96     IBM-PC    Pentium 75.             4  5   .       : ¬´    ?¬ª.    ¬´¬ª  ¬´¬ª.    ,     .   1998      ¬´¬ª   ¬´ , ,   ¬ª, .. ,                . <br><br>            ,        .    ¬´¬ª   .      ‚Äî ¬´     ¬ª.            . <br><br>      ,    ,  .  .        ,         . <br><br>              51,    .

In my spare time I do what is called IoT now. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">With the purchase of a paper edition, a separate story was published. Searches began with Avito, found an option in Yekaterinburg, a book battered, but quite readable. I signed with the seller, almost agreed, but I decided to look for more. And he discovered one second-hand book resource, where a copy was found for 500 rubles (1986 edition, with a beige cover). Bargained for 400 - did not work :-) The seller quickly sent everything, I gave 500 rubles and after a couple of days I took the book from the post office. The edition is in excellent condition, by the way. And then this seller wrote to me that he had specifically sold a book, a rarity book :-)</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">What I like most about it is that the author is not at all embarrassed to explain on the fingers how a particular component works. After all, as Einstein said, ‚ÄúIf you can‚Äôt explain a 6-year-old child, you don‚Äôt understand it‚Äù. Svoren himself understands everything and explains that there are practically no obscure places left. Other authors are often guilty of this, again - in my opinion, they hide behind their complex explanations their own misunderstanding of the topic. In terms of accessibility, a comparison with another author, the American author, Charles Petzold, and his book Code, seems appropriate to me. They even have a manner of presenting the material.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">about the content - I would add material about the Internet of things, perhaps a description of any interesting projects on Raspberry Pi or Arduino. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">After all, starting from scratch in electronics is now quite difficult (I mean collecting the devices myself). </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And on single board - simple.</font></font><br><br><h5> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Sergey, Verkhnyaya Tura</font></font></b> </h5><br><img width="400" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cfc/fc0/298/cfcfc029811e4e729d4b82db9b5c23c0.JPG"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For the only book Svorenya, which was in our village library, "Electronics step by step. Transistor ‚Äùmy friend and I hunted for several months, it was so popular. In the end, the librarian was persuaded to hold it for us, and not just like that, we had to pretty much move the ‚Äúfoundation‚Äù from one hall to another. But it was worth it. We received the book ... and for a long time argued over who would read it first. It is still a shame in front of the library (which (not) by the way, is no longer in sight) and in front of the author :), but we ‚Äúshared‚Äù the book: a friend got from the middle and on, and everything else, that is, the beginning. A week later had an exchange. I still remember illustrations, colorful pictures - 3D schemes :) on a yellow background. In the end, the ‚Äúone to one‚Äù design was repeated on the same yellow background - plywood.Our amateur radio "top" at the time was an amplifier with an output power of about 3 watts. This amplifier determined the interest in low-frequency technology. Then there were self-made tape recorders (both reel and cassette) and a ‚Äúturntable‚Äù with a self-made tonearm and of course a bunch of different amplifiers. Then there was a break and nostalgia.</font></font><br><br><img width="300" align="right" src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8bd/d7a/2c4/8bdd7a2c496c4af5bbf0915be72f8747.JPG"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Memories of the enthusiasm caused by the working construction led to the fact that after almost a 20-year break, I again took up a soldering iron. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Now I am ‚Äúhalf a century‚Äù, on the table is a self-made DAC, self-made tube buffer on Senha‚Äôs head 650, and before my eyes there is an article on Habr√© about a wonderful author and an excellent book, which of course it would be nice to have both the current and those boys. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">PS We glued the book so that even the attentive eye of a professional did not notice anything. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Amateur radio can do anything.</font></font><br><br><h5> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Valery, Novosibirsk</font></font></b> </h5><br><img align="left" width="400" src="https://habrastorage.org/files/eee/650/242/eee650242be8474c96abf9da329d22b9.JPG"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">My name is Valery, I am 21 years old and I live in the Moshkovsky district of the city of Novosibirsk, and I am also a student of the NGPU IFMIOO of the IIM department. I am interested in electronics and programming from the 5th grade. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I learned about the books of Rudolf Anatolyevich from a teacher who led physical electronics. I had previously read various books on this subject, but they felt a lack of agreement on various phenomena. They mainly had schematic diagrams and a description of how to solder them. But why this happens, it was told fluently.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">When I opened and looked through them electronically, I realized that these books tell us exactly what is happening in the circuit and why. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">These books tell how everything is arranged and only the necessary information is written; they didn‚Äôt have the habit of saying water in them. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">These books impressed me with clarity and accessibility. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I often re-read books and constantly find something new for myself. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In my opinion, these books will live forever because everything is clear and understandable in them, there are no gaps in information and jumps from one place to another. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I printed these books for easy reading. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is a pity that these books no longer produce, and in fact they benefit more than soap detectives, which are printed as newspapers, these books are suitable for any age. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If you have not read these books, MUST READ THEM!</font></font><br><br><h5> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Vyacheslav, Voronezh</font></font></b> </h5><br>  I started to get involved in electronics from early childhood, since my father was also fond of this, he is self-taught by the way.  We had a lot of literature at home, several books, magazines, and my father also had enough radio components.  However, I also had to master everything myself, it turned out that there were very few, a lot of failures.  Sometimes threw this hobby, then returned. <br><br>  Once, in the city library I found the book Rudolph Svoreny ‚ÄúElectronics step by step‚Äù.  By the way, I was born in a small provincial town in the Volgograd region.  And I am glad that one could find such a wonderful book in Uryupinsk.  At first I paid attention to the drawings and diagrams, and then I read everything else.  Everything is very simple and clear, it was possible to read from the middle, in chunks or moving from a diagram to a diagram.  And then, I wanted to take the soldering iron in my hands and start creating.  How hard it was to give the book back to the library. <br><br>  Now I understand how the book caught me.  The simplicity of the text, visual diagrams and drawings - this is of course important for any book, but for me the most important thing is the source of inspiration.  The book incredibly encourages you to create with a soldering iron in the hands of unimaginable schemes, I want to conduct experiments and get pleasure from it. <br><br>  These feelings, probably, could be experienced by a young scientist, who peered over Leonardo da Vinci‚Äôs shoulder, whose drawings and works also induce him to create.  Rudolf Svoreny‚Äôs book had a tremendous impact on me, I began to appreciate the beauty of the schemes.  Now it is fashionable to call the word "infographics", and to everyone who studies this science, I would recommend to pay attention to the book "Electronics step by step." <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Continuation</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Of course, there is not very relevant information in the book, but this is history, the history of electronics, so the information in the book will always be relevant.  In addition, the fundamentals and physical principles will never become obsolete, you need to know and understand how it works.  Therefore, I believe that the book can only be supplemented, the main thing is not to lose the grain of inspiration that Rudolf Svoreni planted.  And yes, I got acquainted with this book when I was already 14 or 15. I do not know what effect it had on me, but after school I studied at the radio engineering department of the Voronezh State Technical University in the city of Voronezh.  Here I found a job and stayed alive.  My work is closely related to the design of domestic microcontrollers. <br><br>  I‚Äôm almost 30 years old now, and if this book is reprinted, I will be happy to put it on my shelf of ‚Äúsources of inspiration‚Äù in order to <br>  someday pass it on to your children. <br><br>  Sincerely, Vyacheslav Tarasov, Design Engineer of 1 category, lab.  JSC "NIIET". </div></div><br><br><h5>  <b>Alexey, Ekaterinburg</b> </h5><br>  My name is Alexey Valeryevich Alekseev, born in 1972 in a family of geologists (the personal site of father alekseevvp.ru).  Since 1976 I live in Sverdlovsk.  By specialty radio systems engineer (Department of "RTS"). <br><br>  The book of Rudolf Anatolyevich came into my hands in 1986 as a gift from my father‚Äôs uncle, Gleb Porfiryevich Alekseev (alekceev.narod.ru).  He is a radio engineer, for many years headed the department of technical means of education at the Chelyabinsk Polytechnic University.  Through him, I became interested, in about 5th grade, in radio electronics. <br><br>  The books were very tight, so at first I used V. Borisov, ‚ÄúYoung Amateur Radio‚Äù, ‚ÄúPractical Young Amateur Radio Workshop‚Äù, then my uncle handed me his copy of ‚ÄúThe Art of Circuit Engineering‚Äù Horovitsa and Hill, but for a 6-7 grader, this is still too ‚Äúscientific ¬ªBook.  And only when I received the book Svorenya, all other sources became faded and uninteresting. <br><br>  I, of course, soldered not only and not so much about Electronics Step by Step, but also on Radio, on Young Technician and his application for skilled hands, and on the Model Designer.  But nowhere did I come across such a deeply analytically verified text.  Undoubtedly, logical thinking and relations with the real world were largely supplied by the texts of Rudolf Anatolyevich.  Clarity, coherence, versatility, imagery, constant attachment to life and events in it.  Scientific nature, accuracy and correctness of presentation.  Examples are credible and real.  There are no words how this book helped me in my life.  One of the very few that I will never throw away from the personal library. <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Continuation</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Already then, in 1987, there was one drawback of the book: the radio details shown in the drawings of the 60s were hard to get at the end of the 80s to a simple lad who was not recorded in any radio circle.  Parents, apparently, were jealous of my uncle, and did not support interest in the radio business (though they did not interfere).  In the local radio shops there was far from everything, and only mail and catalog orders were rescued.  Well, one trip of a friend to Moscow, where, at my request, he went to the Mitinsky radio market and purchased several IC 155th series. <br>  Entered in 1989 at the instrument engineering department of the CPI, on the specialty "0707", in 1992 transferred for family reasons to the UPI at the radio engineering faculty.  What graduated with honors in 1995 (5.5 years of study).  He worked at ALCATEL, ROSNET, MegaFon, now at Rostelecom.  In fact, it turned out a semi-universal specialist at the junction of communications, billing, contracts and IT systems.  Higher education successfully complemented the basis that was laid by the book of R.A.  Leafing through his book now, 20 years later, I was surprised to find that in my reasoning I use many techniques drawn from the suggestions of this remarkable book.  I'm not talking about the ability to constantly accompany the reasoning with simple unpretentious drawings. <br><br>  I finished my own exercises with a soldering iron about 15 years ago, at the very end of the 1990s.  I watched the clock on the IC, simple amplifiers, sound and MW / UHF, direct gain radio receivers, simple automation and similar simple things. <br>  I want to express the only (urgent!) Desire for reprinting: to modernize the drawings, because now showing the MP39 or the electric motor from Soviet toys is a ‚Äúdeparture from reality‚Äù.  Modern children have not seen this and will not see, even if they want.  The reprint itself is very welcome, but the book must be sewn and in hardback, on thick paper.  My copy was in the hands of only me, I carefully handle the books, but even then there are spots on the pages, the fabric of the binding is torn, the fly-leaf is cracked. <br></div></div><br><br><h5>  <b>Congratulations</b> </h5><br>  On behalf of all who left feedback, who noted in the questionnaire - we congratulate Rudolf Anatolyevich on his birthday! <br><br>  <b>We wish you health and creative power!</b> <br><br>  And as one of the participants said: <i>His books have become something more than just books on electronics, because they have a soul, the desire to convey the material in such a way as to read one or another of his books until the end even those whose activities in general not related to electronics.</i>  <i>Thank you very much for the invaluable contribution to the development of knowledge of many generations!</i> <br><br><h5>  <b>Links</b> </h5><br>  * <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/274204/">Rudolf Svoren - a man of legend (part 1)</a> <br>  * <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/makeitlab/blog/282105/">Rudolf Svoren - a man of legend (part 2)</a> <br>  * <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1_Q7dJhR-9EUF8mKW_fRu31NdRRw2RJMXbTF7lzkPof0/viewform">Pre-order form for the book</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/394545/">https://habr.com/ru/post/394545/</a></p>
