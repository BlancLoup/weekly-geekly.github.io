  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Prestigio Visconte - a business tablet on Windows 8.1</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Today the market of electronic devices is replete with gadgets for every taste and color.  This also applies to tablets.  And due to the fact that user needs are growing day by day, manufacturers are increasingly switching to Windows 8, thanks to which the capabilities of the device expand many times over.  Yes, and buy such devices better.  In order not to stay away from this holiday of life, Prestigio has released its first tablet on Windows 8: Prestigio Multipad Visconte. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/381/f44/2d1/381f442d180c5e82668d1c5249612bf3.jpg"><br><br>  Let's start with the fact that I am definitely ‚Äúlucky‚Äù with the technique.  Another would, in my place, rejoice at the free computers and laptops that employees give out at work.  Of course, I am also happy, but, somehow, not completely. <br>  The fact is that I come across exclusively Apple technology.  Be it an iMac on a recording studio, a Mac Pro on a media production studio or, as it is now, a MacBook Pro (not a retina). <br>  In principle, you can live with a macbook.  Beautiful touchpad, quick start, settings at hand.  But, the hands themselves are pulled first to install Windows 8.1 in Parallels Desktop, and then completely put the full "eight" through Boot Camp. <br>  Habit affects and more than 25 years of experience with the PC. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  As many know, Apple is not very welcome customers desire to use the OS from Microsoft on their computers.  Therefore, the touchpad drivers in Boot Camp, to put it mildly, not very.  The third-party Trackpad ++ driver loads about three minutes after starting Win8.  Until that time, right-click is simply impossible.  The lack of the PageUp \ PageDown, Home \ End keys looks strange at all.  We have to put up with these shortcomings.

      In addition, my work involves constant patrols around Moscow, both on the metro and behind the wheel.  Macbook, of course, reliable, made of aviation aluminum.  All this metallic splendor has to be carried on its shoulders.  At the same time, quite a bit is required from the computer: office applications, browser, Skype and rare work sessions in Adobe Illustrator. <br>  Gradually, a simple idea came to mind - I absolutely do not need a laptop for work, but I need a tablet!  With full-fledged "Windows".  With multitouch.  And to be easy.  Such that could make the company to other my home devices with OS from Microsoft: a desktop, the mini-server and the old Samsung Q1U tablet, with the resistive screen.  The latter, frankly, is long overdue. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1a5/90d/a2c/1a590da2cd20c5be46eee667157355ff.png"><br>  <i>Scheme of my movements in Moscow for a month</i> <br><br>  And so, most recently, the stars are located in the most successful way: I got exactly what I was looking for.  Lightweight tablet with a large screen diagonal and full multitouch (oh, these gestures!). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/190/7af/9ed/1907af9edd291aa713d868697288c332.jpg"><br>  <i>Let's pretend you don't know yet which tablet is being talked about?</i> <br><br>  A colleague, going on vacation, took a new tablet from Prestigio for testing.  It was planned to write an article about the tablet during a two-week rest with my grandmother, in the town of Kasimov, which stands on the bank of the Oka. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5ff/464/f1c/5ff464f1c229f8d4ee7e0a304e582044.jpg"><br>  <i>It seems that this town still lives in the twentieth century.</i> <br><br>  Alas, as always, an urgent need to add a semantic core for the site, add new cards to the catalog, and the director does not let go.  In general, the tablet, he safely, forgot in the office and went to the bus station.  Of course, a colleague called us, asked to urgently bring the tablet to the bus, but who wants to be dragged to the outskirts of Moscow in this heat? <br><br><h4>  First meeting </h4>  This is how the tablet got into my pens, tired of the weight of MacBook.  The device comes in a cardboard box, painted in silver and black checkered.  The upper part shows the device itself, the logo and company name, the name of the device, as well as information that the tablet has a pre-installed Microsoft Office 2013. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/009/bc5/6af/009bc56af2033e48cc428da8ab243b7b.jpg"><br>  <i>Our first meeting looked something like this.</i> <br><br>  On the right side face there is information about the operating system and the configuration. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9c0/e77/3a4/9c0e773a4d7f4df0a6829c17838b75cf.jpg"><br><br>  On the reverse side of the box there are data about the device in Russian and English, the amount of memory, which can be 32 or 64 GB and the QR code, which you consider will be taken to the manufacturer‚Äôs website. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3fc/93c/136/3fc93c13638c3b60ecb744feffacf416.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Unpacking a nice box </h4> In the upper compartment lies, now my (heh!), A work tool wrapped with soft polyethylene.  We immediately see that the design of the tablet is quite typical, strict, but it‚Äôs not for nothing that the manufacturer positions it as a business tablet.  The display of the device is covered with a protective glass, there are small black sides around the edges - this is done so that the tablet is comfortable to hold and there are no false positives. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/25a/324/aba/25a324abafc7954da483a87b1468dd9c.jpg"><br>  <i>Strict front</i> <br><br>  On the front surface, only the Windows 8 logo stands out, which is very interestingly beaten in the form of faces.  Touch button, by clicking on which, you can always get to the OS main menu. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/022/71d/821/02271d8219c5af8907a7bb0bdf8be3b7.jpg"><br><br>  The device has a metal case, painted in silver color, and on its back is located in the center of the logo of the manufacturer and the name of the device. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7ba/a1d/1aa/7baa1d1aa430f8539ef34977ef72567f.jpg"><br>  <i>Stylish rear</i> <br><br>  The package bundle is standard, it includes: the tablet itself, a USB cable, a network adapter.  There is also a sticker with a serial for Win 8 and waste paper (does anyone even read these instructions?): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/faa/fd8/d9a/faafd8d9a9cbd1a50191be553c417c46.jpg"><br>  <i>Your documents?</i> <br><br>  By the way, the network adapter for our country is somewhat non-standard, but there is a complete adapter. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1a0/f90/a5c/1a0f90a5c073a8f9511be0c394019ff3.jpg"><br>  <i>Suddenly, a business trip to London.</i>  <i>So I'm ready!</i> <br><br>  And ... Everything.  Kit, to put it mildly, not rich.  If the manufacturer inquired about my opinion, I would have heard the wish to have an adapter with a microHDMI for a full connector and a adapter for microUSB (like my Galaxy Note 3) for a full USB (mother) as standard.  Alas, these ‚Äúaccessories‚Äù will have to be bought separately.  However, I already have them. <br><br><h4>  We consider in more detail </h4>  The tablet is charged through a separate adapter, the plug of which I, at first, tried to plug everything into the tablet connector intended for headphones.  Subsequently, it became possible to get used to the location of all the connectors of the device, and now even auxiliary inscriptions engraved on the back cover are not required to be read. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/57d/2a0/38e/57d2a038ea318ee2704786e74d15c7c5.jpg"><br>  <i>Here?</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/799/8cb/429/7998cb42955de187c1affd0d6baab1ea.jpg"><br>  <i>Or here?</i> <br><br><h4>  Tablet design </h4>  The screen of the device is framed in black frame.  The color of the back cover is gray.  On the manufacturer's website is available another option with a white cap.  Gray I like.  The relief logo of the company is engraved in the center of the cover. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/326/2a3/ac2/3262a3ac243c95b305a6c564904bbcf2.jpg"><br>  <i>The logo is really unusual.</i>  <i>I always want to touch him</i> <br><br>  The edges of the lower part are occupied by stereo speakers, hidden behind perforated grilles.  Part of the grids smoothly "flows" on the side bends of the tablet.  Because of this, the surface of the table on which the device rests does not completely muffle the sound.  In the lower right corner are two small stickers, but in my opinion they are out of place and spoil the appearance of the device. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/076/f7a/330/076f7a330d1a4f3d72cd800f9bef38fd.jpg"><br>  <i>These grids are located on the left and right</i> <br><br>  The power button can turn on / off the tablet.  Holding the button for more than four seconds will allow a forced reboot to start.  This is a function for me, so far, not useful.  Found it by accident - put the tablet on the right side of the table and inadvertently pressed on the case. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/22b/511/082/22b51108223848aab23c4465663a010b.jpg"><br>  <i>Power and volume buttons.</i>  <i>The light indicator is built in the power button.</i> <br><br>  According to the manufacturer, the tablet supports memory cards up to 64 gigabytes.  Thus, if necessary, you can double the amount of available memory.  On the one hand, a significant part of the internal memory is occupied by the OS and the basic set of applications.  On the other hand, I have been using the tablet for more than two weeks, and the empty space does not even think about running out.  Although, perhaps, the torrents on it are not enough to shake.  And I do not need.  For torrents at home there is a separate file-loader.  But now you can watch video via Wi-Fi on the big screen.  There are no problems with the support of codecs in Windows, and there never was. <br><br>  From charging Galaxy Note 3, the tablet charges more slowly than from the ‚Äúnative‚Äù adapter.  It's a pity.  It would be convenient to carry with you only one charger, instead of two. <br><br>  Work with HDMI is quite predictable.  Do you want to display on the TV screen a mirror image of the tablet desktop.  You want - only video, in the advanced mode, and at the same time, continue to work. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e33/0d1/b10/e330d1b10ff6a374773af6649eaa74da.jpg"><br>  <i>Memory card slot, charging connector, microUSB, microHDMI, headphone jack</i> <br><br>  About the camera, I can only say that it works adequately in Skype.  I consider stupid to photograph anything on the front camera of the tablet.  Not for that it is intended. <br>  I have been looking for a long time where the microphone is installed in the tablet.  It turned out right there, next to the camera.  The sensitivity of the microphone allows you to communicate with the interlocutor at a distance of about a meter.  Ideally, it is worthwhile to immediately turn on the software gain of the microphone signal in the OS settings and no longer return to this settings item. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/292/b8d/94c/292b8d94cda7e5b64d23685bd7f0d172.jpg"><br>  <i>Camera lens, light sensor and microphone</i> <br><br><h4>  operating system </h4>  Prestigio Visconte runs on Windows 8.1 Pro.  The operating system is identical to the PC version.  This allows you to work with all applications available on your computer. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f6b/2f6/446/f6b2f64465aa4190e213cb1b86d77568.jpg"><br><br>  In addition to standard programs, Evernote and Microsoft Office 2013 are preinstalled, which you only need to activate. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1c5/7a5/b53/1c57a5b53217616ca73d23d897d546cd.jpg"><br><br>  You can use the classic desktop or use the Metro UI interface, specially designed for touch displays. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d42/7c9/16b/d427c916b0d4bc1b65166642e33fa1b8.jpg"><br><br>  One of the most noticeable flaws of Windows 8.1 can be considered a list of programs optimized for the new tiled interface.  It is not very big, often there are not enough games, media players and other entertainment applications in the Metro UI style.  However, Microsoft is not abandoning its operating system and more and more new applications appear in the Windows Store every day. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ab9/d83/8f4/ab9d838f43a7c0d124c23948b6554545.jpg"><br><br>  All wireless modules work, you can pick up a wireless keyboard or headphones. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/06b/00a/436/06b00a4360e99cb42eff8c48ea33f8fb.jpg"><br><br>  According to the functions of this tablet for me, as they say, "what the doctor ordered."  Solid workhorse.  It does not bend in the hands, does not make noise with a cooler and allows you to carry it, along with charging and working documents, in a small briefcase, with a strap "over the shoulder".  Goodbye, very heavy backpack!  Well, at least for the summer. <br><br><h4>  Benchmarks </h4>  The processor is dual-core - Intel Celeron N2805, so to speak, an entry-level, which is characterized by reduced power consumption.  Powered by a frequency of 1.46 GHz and built on a 22-nanometer part of the Bay Trail-M platform. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a93/30b/43c/a9330b43cc96369ac782c76ec565154b.jpg"><br><br>  In the 3DMark test, the tablet doesn‚Äôt demonstrate high performance, but for most office tasks the device‚Äôs stuffing will be enough. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e04/a04/e21/e04a04e2103e17abf83a6472b702c505.jpg"><br><br>  Absolutely did not want to engage in benchmarks, because I think that if the car is going, then there is no need to open the hood on the go and see why this is happening.  You just need to enjoy the ride.  Nevertheless, given that my ‚Äúcar‚Äù is not a Rolls-Royce Phantom, but rather a Ford Focus, Kia Rio or another car, more suitable as a company car, the results of synthetic tests may seem interesting to someone. <br><br><h4>  What we have </h4><ul><li>  OS - Windows 8.1 Pro </li><li>  Screen size - 10 inches (smaller - this is almost my phone will work) </li><li>  HDMI is </li><li>  Slot for memory cards - also useful, probably </li><li>  Memory capacity - 64 gigabytes </li><li>  Multi-touch - ten fingers (when you touch the screen, translucent ‚Äúcircles‚Äù appear under your fingers, the number of which I calculated) </li><li>  The screen resolution is the same as that of the working macbook (1280x800) </li><li>  3G - there are models with mobile Internet </li><li>  I now have a mobile 3G Wi-Fi router in my bag, which allows me to work from my tablet for the weekend, without getting up from my chair, in my country house.  Enough, perhaps, to register new SIM cards for new devices </li></ul><br><h4>  Full specifications </h4><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fe1/2cf/627/fe12cf627631c626104bcf788ffc6644.png" alt="image">  <b>Screen:</b> 10.1 ", 1280 √ó 800 px, IPS, HD <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/806/871/aac/806871aac785f1ac7a45fe2360d5ef7a.png" alt="image">  <b>Processor:</b> Intel Celeron Processor N2805 (1.45 GHz, 2 cores) <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cf7/d69/613/cf7d6961340b5b16fa821567a8cdb089.png" alt="image">  <b>Video accelerator:</b> Intel HD Graphics <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7ed/145/aaa/7ed145aaabcfa9106c6be7a26f087b92.png" alt="image">  <b>Operating system:</b> Windows 8.1 Pro <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/08f/b11/4cf/08fb114cf05af12329a682c7d179d012.png" alt="image">  <b>RAM:</b> 2 GB DDR3L <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/487/aaf/2c0/487aaf2c012384e1cf135a561ba6a5f0.png" alt="image">  <b>User Memory:</b> 64 GB + microSDXC slot <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cb8/0be/398/cb80be398f5ff56284fa2b3191102593.png" alt="image">  <b>Camera:</b> Front - 1 MP <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cce/212/125/cce21212518144071cb410c070f452dc.png" alt="image">  <b>Optional:</b> Bluetooth 4.0, HDMI, Wi-Fi, miniHDMI, mini-jack 3.5 mm, microUSB 3.0, microSD, accelerometer <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1f0/8d9/6c5/1f08d96c5889f650144a0d8e30a2b5bc.png" alt="image">  <b>Battery:</b> 8000 mAh <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0d6/598/1a8/0d65981a80a55a05019aba9215d64193.png" alt="image">  <b>Dimensions:</b> 258.66 x 173.3 x 9.9 mm <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b2f/bfb/235/b2fbfb235eb524cec4c6508c5931bc2b.png" alt="image">  <b>Weight:</b> 580 Grams <br><br><h4>  Experience of use </h4>  I do not know what it is connected with, but Illustrator was placed on the tablet for two (!) Hours. <br>  Office - half an hour, and this is normal.  In principle, an office for home and students is already installed here, but, I have an honestly purchased license for the proshka.  We demolish one office and put another.  There is nothing to squander useful gigabytes! <br>  Also, I put dropbox, google drive, basic multimedia kit: audio and video player, graphic file viewer and (hooray hooray!) A full-featured two-pane file manager, which does not exist for Mac.  Rather, there are such programs, but, I believe, this is the total mockery of the user.  Solid ANRIAL.  It's even embarrassing to compare with analogs under Windows. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e7b/eea/aff/e7beeaaffb53973b6a232c874e055463.jpg"><br>  <i>Typical office plankton software suite</i> <br><br>  In general, during one evening, I became the owner of the device, the functionality of which fully covers all my requirements for the working tool. <br>  Also, I discovered the game Pinball in the standard Windows installation, during the game in which several long trips to the subway flew unnoticed.  Touch the screen conveniently.  Graphics - android was not around. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2b8/6c3/2c5/2b86c32c5c052d49f9293c99614ba035.jpg"><br>  <i>Immediately bought an additional table in the local market</i> <br><br>  The volume of the built-in speakers is excellent.  However, when I tried to show the visitor of the <a href="http://balrobotov.ru/">Ball of Robots</a> exhibition the video of one of our products on the tablet, the maximum volume level was not enough for comfortable listening.  It is understandable.  Every day, we, representatives of companies working at the exhibition, lovers of robotics and gadgets, are poured into the ears of music at such a loudness that sometimes even it‚Äôs difficult to make out what the nearby person tells you.  These are the work days. <br><br>  On the other hand, writing reports, keeping tables and monitoring our site from a compact tablet is a pleasure. <br><br><h4>  Battery </h4>  The tablet is equipped with a 4000 mAh 7.4V battery (8000 mAh 3.7V).  With active use, the tablet lives for about 4-5 hours, but in the energy saving mode it is around eight hours, which is very good. <br><br><h4>  Total </h4>  For the sake of interest, I installed a trial version of Autodesk Inventor on the tablet.  I will, on the sly, learn to create 3D models for the Form 1 printer, which is often idle in our office.  Well, what, there should be some bonuses from working in a company that promotes innovative gadgets in the Russian market?  So I decided. <br><br>  Things are easy - get a salary, bite off a decent piece of it, and buy MY tablet.  Will not give it back.  Here is the truth.  Even MacBook back.  And this is mine! <br><br>  Quite by chance, I became the owner of the device, as if made specifically for me.  A stylish, lightweight business tablet has become a major tool in my daily work.  And, even when I come home, I don‚Äôt turn on, with my usual movement, the system unit, perched under the table, but I fall onto the sofa, take the tablet out of my bag and start browsing my favorite sites.  Oh, it's time to charge the tablet! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/228987/">https://habr.com/ru/post/228987/</a></p>
