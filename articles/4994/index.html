Many services of a new generation, and first of all <a href="http://youtube.com/">YouTube</a> , have made watching videos on the Internet a normal everyday activity of an ordinary Internet user, like reading email and fresh news.  Moreover, each owner of a modern mobile phone can also record a video and publish it on the Internet, not to mention those users who have long been passionately involved in video filming - they will gladly agree to receive money for their hobby.  For video lovers and independent film publishers, the Internet is becoming a new source of income. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Scott Kisner writes in his book <a href="http://stores.lulu.com/kirsner">The Future of Web Video: New Opportunities for Producers, Entrepreneurs, Media Companies and Advertisers</a> about new services that make it possible for a video fan.  On his website, the author has published a <a href="http://www.scottkirsner.com/webvid/gettingpaid.htm">large excerpt</a> from the book, which lists all known commercial video services describing the business model of each of them.  This is perhaps the most detailed overview of this sector of the market, which can only be found in the public domain.  We publish a brief squeeze out of it. <br><br>  1. <a href="http://www.atomfilms.com/film_upload.jsp">Atom Entertainment</a> , operating since 1999, now owned by MTV Networks / Viacom. <br>  Short films are accepted, including animated, usually up to five minutes.  They undergo a rigorous selection, after which the best get the opportunity of exclusive placement on the site.  An exclusive contract is usually for a fixed term.  Deductions to the author depend on the popularity of the video, sometimes paid in advance.  Since the launch of the service has already paid more than $ 3 million in fees.  There is a special program for the best producers who receive a deposit to create works exclusively for AtomFilms.  Related site <a href="http://www.addictingclips.com/CashForClips.aspx">Addicting Clips</a> accepts any content.  The authors of the most popular videos there get $ 500. <br><br>  2. <a href="http://one.revver.com/revver/go/makers%2Bartists%2Bwanted">Revver</a> 2005 <br>  Amateur photography, scenes from life.  Maximum file size: 100 MB.  This service is reminiscent of YouTube, but only at the end of each video is placed a small piece of advertising.  The author receives half of the profits from the display of advertising, and only those views are paid, after which the user followed the advertising link (from 75 cents to a dollar per transition).  Partner sites that host links to videos receive 20% of advertising revenue.  The technology allows you to take into account the transitions on advertising links, even if the video file is sold in thousands of copies on the Internet.
