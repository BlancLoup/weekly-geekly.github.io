We started quite banal - with SCS in offices more than 20 years ago.  Then we went to smart buildings, power centers, data centers, autonomous installations far outside the cities, industrial facilities - and now several stadiums. <br><br>  In total, we implemented 22 engineering subsystems from security with a system for detecting sabotage and terrorist facilities to high-density Wi-Fi, television and radio broadcasting systems and multimedia screens at the Ekaterinburg Arena stadium.

      Today I will talk about security, and a little later in another post, my colleague from the telecommunications department will tell you about cable and audio-visual systems. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Security </h3><br>  There is a ticket system that is integrated into the general ticket system FIFA-2018.  Come with a fan passport, and now he's with an RFID tag.  At the entrance to the stadium, you apply it, and the photo of the person corresponding to the tag code is displayed to the steward, he visually checks whether the person has come.  A camera is installed next to it, which allows verification and face recognition in automatic mode, but according to a separate letter from the Ministry of Internal Affairs for the duration of the championship, identification is not required - it works like a video surveillance system. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/s3/el/sf/s3elsfqqh8wwbeygjo0pqsog_lg.jpeg"><br>  <i>Entry group.</i>  <i>Full height turnstiles</i> <br><br>  The order of the Ministry of Internal Affairs No. 1092 for sports facilities already imposes requirements that every turnstile has a face recognition system.  The fan is compared with the base of fans (that he is he, and not some kind of left-handed person with his subscription, and whether he is on the black list of the club), as well as the base of the Ministry of Internal Affairs (if he is wanted). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qn/uo/vv/qnuovv52wrm-o5siehomdk2oxza.jpeg"><br>  <i>Pavilion of inspection</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/4l/m2/0-/4lm20--gx5r1wfbgf0-dpbccfxk.jpeg"><br>  <i>Introscopes</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/_y/u3/2x/_yu32xvimtzczp0xmw0luwtl0he.jpeg"><br>  <i>Radioactive Detection Sensor</i> <br><br>  The second identification is already on the ticket: you enter the inspection pavilion (metal detectors, introscopes, radiation monitoring).  In case of pollution beeps incredibly.  Beside the dogs, they sniff out the crowd as a whole.  For spot checks there are special equipment of the type of vacuum cleaner on the look - sniffers for explosives.  If someone worked with a plastid, picked up the phone, and brought the phone to the stadium - the sniffer will find it.  If this device showed the presence of traces of explosive, then further - chemical analysis in the express laboratory in the pavilion nearby. <br><br>  Alerting possible questions, the sniffer is only tuned to a number of compounds characteristic of explosives.  Alcohol and other compounds that alter consciousness, does not register. <br><br>  But here for any dangerous liquids like gasoline and incendiary mixtures also have their own device.  It recognizes such substances without disturbing the tightness of the vessels. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/_1/8s/zz/_18szzg-bwvlm8hd2kqd0ymcuzc.jpeg"><br>  <i>Half-height turnstiles.</i>  <i>Passage into the sector</i> <br><br>  Passing from the buffer zone to the ‚Äúgreen‚Äù is also possible with tickets - it is possible only to your sector. <br>  If the streams of fans mix, they can start to fight.  A fan of the winning team, accidentally crowded into a crowd of fans of opponents at the exit, is a rare application for the Darwin Award.  But that also happened.  Therefore, the division by sector is done inside the stadium.  With your ticket you can only to your fans.  Due to this, there have been fewer and fewer incidents lately. <br><br>  The buffer zone is divided rigidly only if dangerous teams like Spartak-Zenit match.  During local matches, for example, it is relatively open, you can walk freely in it.  There were no restrictions on FIFA either, there is everything for tolerance. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rb/vy/6v/rbvy6vja9h7svgfc1adsg-wujow.jpeg"><br>  <i>Unified stadium control center</i> <br><br>  The accounting system of fans counts people, registers the arrival.  FIFA portals at the exit ensure that everyone is gone.  The announcer of the match informs the occupancy of the stands on the ticket-passing system. <br><br>  At the opening match of the stadium "Yekaterinburg Arena" 26 868 fans were recorded. <br><br>  Separately, accredited people are considered (they pass not by passport, but by accreditation) - this is the media and the attendants. <br><br>  We also equipped contact points for special services, but I can‚Äôt talk about them. <br><br><h3>  Ticket Office </h3><br>  The stadium has kept the historical facade since the times of the USSR.  Preserved and historical box office, there are very distinctive pavilions.  All this heritage is protected by the Ministry of Culture.  At the request of the club, we installed terminals at the box office for printing tickets and season tickets so that they work.  There is even one live cashier who serves them.  In the days of the match - not one. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/br/ry/so/brryso0uwybrja14zlluf0yzrbm.jpeg"><br><br>  Along the perimeter of the stadium there are also terminals (some already) for buying and printing tickets.  They are already for self-service.  The terminals are integrated with the ticketing system. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ay/lj/ws/ayljwszjf3nwhlgtklheor83ae8.jpeg"><br>  <i>Self-service terminal</i> <br><br>  But the whole story is, of course, for the heritage regime.  FIFA has its own system there, and purchase only through the site. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qs/fe/cy/qsfecyj2epqd-5rvzdumqy-ai-0.jpeg"><br><br><h3>  Structural Monitoring and Emergency Response </h3><br>  As part of increasing the safety of the stadium, there is a monitoring system for engineering structures - there are tilt meters, piezo sensors, and so on.  They track offsets from given limits.  The design is alive, breathing: thermally expands and contracts, deforms under gusts of wind - there is a weather station on the roof, which transmits the parameters of wind and weather to adjust the sensor readings.  The entire vault of the stadium is mounted on 8 pylons - near them the sensors register displacements.  All these data are transmitted to the situational center of the stadium, to the situational center of the Ministry of Emergency Situations. <br><br>  <b>Sensor example:</b> <br>  <i>Three-component accelerometer for the study of seismic signals, monitoring of industrial vibrations, microseismic studies of building structures, type R-sensors MTSS-1043A, measurement range ¬± 0.8 g, sensitivity 6 V / g, non-diff.</i>  <i>output, frequency band 0.1‚Äì120 Hz, dynamic range 130 dB, Ethernet interface, temperature range ‚Äì30 ... + 55 ¬∞ C, power supply 220 V 50 Hz.</i> <br><br>  There are string strain gauges in IP54 design and laser total stations with reflectors for deformation grades.  For data acquisition, multiplexers and dataloggers are used. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/nh/b5/vw/nhb5vwdg17i2d28t_fap8u-idug.jpeg"><br>  <i>Total station</i> <br><br>  There is monitoring of engineering systems (this is not dispatching and local automation, but the upper level of collecting information from engineering networks and security systems for transmission to the Emergencies Ministry site and to the Safe City). <br><br>  For the operational work of the Ministry of Emergency Situations and the police throughout the stadium on the escape routes are red phones - SUX (control system in crisis situations).  In other words, special nodes are physical wired telephones with a separate PBX with increased survivability.  They are connected to the intercom with a special non-flammable armored cable.  Imagine differential algebra in composite diamond armor and the look of Chuck Norris ‚Äî that cable is so invincible.  Fire resistance is at least 180 minutes, of the features of the shell is the absence of halogen gases and low smoke emission in the combustion process.  In general, all the guests. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ax/8g/bx/ax8gbx17h5b59ecplzoigbgyoow.jpeg"><br>  <i>SUX</i> <br><br><h3>  Subsystems of new pavilions </h3><br>  Since the stadium in the original is designed for 23 thousand people, we had to put temporary stands - the championship should be at least 35 thousand.  Because of this, the base pavilions are no longer enough to fill the stadium for an hour, as it should be according to FIFA standards.  For compliance with the standards, temporary pavilions were erected with the entire infrastructure - an additional 2 pavilions with 11,000 capacity.  There all the engineer: fire, alert, their UPS, water, heat, electricity, heating. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ey/fw/df/eyfwdf4cz7pe1qiiegkq-ubikc4.jpeg"><br>  <i>Temporary Pavilion</i> <br><br>  Separate inspection system for VIP-zones, transport checkpoints with barriers, hedgehogs, bollards and radiation monitoring.  The same inspection, everything is relatively standard. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jx/qb/wf/jxqbwfhpj2k455q5krii0cas_qq.jpeg"><br>  <i>Gearbox</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/az/0f/26/az0f26yhttaecg5azc-21vjwdtc.jpeg"><br><br>  Implementation: ticket-passing system (payment system, cash, access control system, information display system, central server part).  Monitoring system and management of engineering systems of buildings and structures: physical security system, fire safety system, electrical systems, mechanical systems, monitoring system of the deformation state of supporting structures, crisis management system.  There are also communication and data transmission systems of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, Federal Security Service, Federal Security Service, technological solutions and measures aimed at countering terrorist acts, temporary inspection pavilions with the main engineering systems.  TV and radio broadcasting system: a subsystem for connecting audio and video equipment on the field, stands and in the press center, a subsystem for connecting the PTS (mobile television station), a switching subsystem and a control panel. <br><br>  I have everything, the next report will be my colleague from the department of telecommunications. <br><br><h3>  Links </h3><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/company/croc/blog/241305/">Stadium "Spartacus" (sound)</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/company/croc/blog/346902/">Stadium Security</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/company/croc/blog/269585/">Wi-Fi high density in the stadium in Krasnodar</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/company/croc/blog/323044/">How we reconstructed the courthouse</a> </li><li>  My mail: itsarev@croc.ru </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/419479/">https://habr.com/ru/post/419479/</a></p>
