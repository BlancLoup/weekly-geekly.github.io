Some companies just decided to make a ‚Äúcastling‚Äù.  Someone it seems insufficient to establish two companies and take the presidency in the third.  Therefore, he is looking for personnel for two new projects. <br><br>  "Megamind" invites readers to recall these events and make a "commit" of the changes that have occurred. <a name="habracut"></a>

At the same time, the number of resumes increased by the same amount. <br><br>  The company notes that if we compare the situation with 2008, when the activity in recruiting has dropped several times, now the situation is much more interesting - the structure of hiring itself is changing.  The decrease in the number of vacancies in the IT industry was due to the mass segment. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThis is a business response to a change in the economy - hiring for solving problems of extensive growth is declining.  At the same time, the importance of increasing efficiency is increasing, ‚Äùquoted analysts of the portal CNews. <br><br><blockquote>  Most of all - almost 2 times - the demand for IT specialists related to cellular, wireless and network technologies has decreased.  At the same time, the demand for CRM specialists (+ 39%), mobile developers (+ 29%) and project management (+ 10%) increased. <br><br>  Applicants are reorienting to areas with growing demand: the number of resumes in the development and administration of CRM systems increased by 71%, in mobile development - by 54%, in project management - by 63%. <br><br>  Almost a quarter of vacancies for specialists in the field of information technology are in IT companies.  The second place is in the demand for IT specialists - the production sector (18% of all vacancies for the IT sector), retail trade lags behind very little (17%). </blockquote></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/298666/">https://habr.com/ru/post/298666/</a></p>
