But then I wondered - will there be a Russian version?  It is clear that <i>Taralej &amp; JaboCrack SoftWare</i> will not put a hand to it.  The site of Russian developers among the supported languages ‚Äã‚Äãwas not at all.  Of course, there could be a fan version on the torrents with the translation pulled out of the original, but what about honest buyers?  To play in their native language, they would have to download pirates. <br><br>  Having wrapped this thought in three paragraphs in English, I wrote a letter to Al Lowe himself, the creator of the cult series.  It was December 23, the Americans probably prepared for the holidays (Christmas on the nose), so I almost did not hope for an answer.  However, after 3 days I received it.  Al wrote that he is grateful for the desire to help and has already sent my letter to the developers.  That same day, I received a letter from Kevin Kettler, director of corporate strategy for <b>Replay Games</b> .  They were interested in my proposal, but at that time the script was only 50% ready.  We discussed the deadlines, and in the middle of January, Kevin sent me the NDA and IP Release for signing.  Then the finished half of the script fell into my mail so that I could begin work while the writers finished the game. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Flashback </h4><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">A Brief History of Leisure Suit Larry</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/493/c67/376/493c67376f7526593a86a526e522ce98.jpg"><br>  The original version of Leisure Suit Larry was released in 1987. <br>  It was a text quest - all the teams had to type in words.

Among the Russian-speaking players, this version has received great popularity due to the translation from Taralej &amp; Jabocrack Software. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/612/23d/fae/61223dfae0fd0dd625020f8e7ff60c01.jpg"><br>  The same Bar Lefty in 2013. <br><br>  More information about the <b>Leisure Suit Larry</b> quest series can be read on <a href="http://lurkmore.to/Leisure_Suit_Larry">Lurka</a> . </div></div><br><br><h4>  Timing </h4><br>  I told Kevin that I could manage in two weeks, if the text was the same as the original.  In general, I thought that in the wake of the euphoria I would manage for the weekend.  The yard was January 12th.  I sent the final version of the translation on April 23. <br><br>  Initially, the release of the game was scheduled for March 30, and my transfer deadline is March 15.  Two weeks before the deadline, I realized that I did not have much time, but I still had to send ‚âà 10% of the script.  But then came the news of the postponement of the release on April 30, and I sighed with relief.  However, in order to meet the new deadline, I still had to work even more actively.  As a result, a beta test was launched on April 30, and the release was postponed until the end of June. <br><br><h4>  Work organization </h4><br>  The entire script was contained in a single Excel file, within which were several columns: Object, Action, Speaking, Audio File, English, and Russian.  From time to time, Kevin would send the updated script file, and I had to transfer all my work to it.  In each new version there were lines marked in orange - this meant that it had changed and had to be translated again.  So everything is simple - the files are sent by mail, no svn, complex software or protection. <br><br>  Sometimes I received screenshots of locations indicating the active zones, so that you can understand what is happening and what the objects from the script look like.  This was done because the game became more - new locations, opportunities, characters, and some places were redesigned. <br><br><h4>  How I translated </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/13d/805/a79/13d805a792fc191ee845d33ba8e6542a.jpg"><br>  <i>Picture to attract attention</i> <br><br>  I immediately got to work, just jumping over those cells in which at least one unfamiliar word was found.  If I could translate the phrase right away, but I knew that I could formulate it more beautifully, I would mark the cell with a different color: from light yellow (it would come down, but I would like to modify it) to dark red (horror, be sure to paraphrase).  I was thinking about such places at a time when there was no access to electronic devices (on the way to work, training or to the university), turning over options in my head.  The main script file has always been stored in my Google Drive.  If there was no computer at hand, I simply opened the file from the phone and continued to work.  Uncomfortable, but quite possible. <br><br>  Translation was not easy.  There were plenty of new words and idioms, I often had to open <i>Google Translate</i> .  When I came across another idiom (and they are here at least a dime a dozen), I just googled it, choosing the best option from the first three sites.  It‚Äôs almost meaningless to search for their interpretation in Russian right away - if you find the translation of the desired phraseological unit, it will most certainly not be in the sense that the writers conceived. <br><br>  The best helper for understanding slang is the <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/">urbandicitionary</a> dictionary.  The abundance of vulgar jokes and euphemisms in Leisure Suit Larry rolls over, so I dropped in there almost as often as I did to the translator. <br><br>  Language jokes are always the most difficult, they rarely have direct analogues in Russian.  Therefore, translators come up with something close in meaning.  If this does not work, you have to invent a new joke yourself.  By the way, in the whole game ‚Äúgag‚Äù will meet only a couple of times.  Many times I came up with a successful translation with preserving the meaning and style of the joke only a few days later, or even weeks.  It is difficult to describe the pleasure that you feel at the time of maturation of such options in your head. <br><br>  <i>A small digression for oldfagov.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>It was impossible to transfer all the old pearls to the new game.</i>  <i>For my beloved, ‚ÄúLarry drove by car, all smeared over the tire‚Äù there simply was no room left, since the dialog box with the cause of death no longer exists.</i>  <i>The famous password ‚ÄúI am from SAE‚Äù also had to be left in the past, because the ‚ÄúKen sent me‚Äù text is clearly visible in the HD graphics.</i>  <i>But the old men of SAE and MVK (authors of the translation to ‚ÄúLarry‚Äù of 1991) are not forgotten, you can easily find a tribute to them.</i> <br><br>  In some places, there are funny phrases in the translation that have already become firmly established in our lives, thanks to translators of the series ‚ÄúCourage-Bambay‚Äù, ‚ÄúCube in Cuba‚Äù and others.  He did not want to plagiarize, only to amuse the players with familiar jokes. <br><br>  Checking the age of five questions before the start of the game also did not go away.  I transferred the most successful of them, part simply translated, and I invented half myself.  If the question was tied to American culture, it was replaced.  Direct transfer received only well-known things and events.  Toward the end of the work in the script began to fill columns with other languages ‚Äã‚Äã- French, German, Spanish.  And even without knowing them, I saw that other translators also creatively approached the translation of questions.  It's nice to feel that somewhere there, in other countries, there are people who work with you on the same project and think on the same wavelength. <br><br>  Seriously, I also approached the issue of text formatting: I always taught myself to write the letter ‚Äúe‚Äù instead of ‚Äúe‚Äù, where it is needed;  all dashes are long only, not hyphens, and all quotes are ‚ÄúChristmas trees‚Äù.  If earlier I could type the text, occasionally peeping at the keyboard with one eye, now I write everything blindly. <br><br><h4>  Few numbers </h4><br>  In the final version of the translation: <br>  <b>9000</b> phrases <br>  <b>76,000</b> words <br>  <b>410,000</b> characters (no spaces) <br><br><h4>  What for? </h4><br>  Just for lulz.  Sometime in my free time I was translating subtitles to <a href="http://notabenoid.com/">notabenoid serials</a> .  If you ever watched ‚ÄúHouse‚Äù, ‚ÄúCalifornia‚Äù, ‚ÄúSimpsons‚Äù, ‚ÄúAmerican Dad‚Äù and other TV shows with Russian subtitles, then it is quite likely that I participated in their creation. <br><br>  It was necessary to distract from current projects, and the occupation of one of my hobbies, which I hadn‚Äôt spent time on for a long time, seemed just perfect.  True, this work took <i>much</i> more time and effort than I had planned. <br><br>  Damn it, but I joined the "adult" game dev (if only a translator) and talked to Al Low himself! <br><br>  But the most important goal is to deliver the correct translation to the players, in the spirit of tube T &amp; J.  I hate mistakes in translations, and they are in each.  Movies, games, TV shows - everywhere I meet bloopers that prevent people from perceiving a piece.  It is especially offensive when a translator spoils luxurious jokes or starts building a censor out of himself.  So that people who do not speak English, could get acquainted with a remake of one of the best quests of the 90s, I took up the translation. <br><br><h4>  How much did you get paid? </h4><br>  A question that everyone loves so much.  The game just came out, and I was finally able to tell my friends what I had been working on for several months.  Everyone asks this question first.  I answer: 0.00 $. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/733/c7d/af8/733c7daf8f76bfed7ed41c55c68ab147.jpg"><br><br>  I myself offered to help Al with the translation absolutely free.  However, the guys from <i>Replay Games</i> decided not to remain in debt and promised me a collectible version of the game, including some of the awards from Kickstarter. <br><br>  I hope you enjoy the old new Leisure Suit Larry and its translation.  We are happy to answer your questions in the comments.  Have a nice game! <br><br>  Yesterday, June 27, the game was released on PC, Mac and Linux. <br>  You can buy Leisure Suit Larry <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/231910/">on Steam</a> for 399 rubles. <br>  Or without DRM <a href="https://www.replaygamesinc.com/store/index/products/item/leisure-suit-larry-reloaded">on the developer's site</a> , but for $ 20. <br>  An iOS version is coming soon.  A remake of <b>Leisure Suit Larry 2 is</b> already in development. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">5 months of the subsequent introduction of translation into the game</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  <b>UPD</b> <br>  The developers did not include the Russian language in the starting version, obviously, they will add in the patch. <br>  The game was completed urgently after the beta test, so a non-priority language (Russian was not originally planned at all) just had no time to add.  I have already written a question to Kevin, waiting for an official response. <br><br>  <b>UPD2</b> <br>  I wrote it myself Paul Trowe, the head of Replay Games, is the man through whom the new ‚ÄúLarry‚Äù saw the light. <br><br><blockquote>  <i>It will be included in the patch.</i>  <i>I‚Äôm a cc'ing our Polish programmer I‚Äôm about this as well.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Yours, hopefully, within the next 30 days.</i> </blockquote><br>  <i>Russian and Polish were not included in the game on the day of release, but we will add them in the patch.</i>  <i>I duplicate this letter to a Polish programmer to show how serious I am and how sorry I am that it happened.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Your translation will appear in the game, I hope, in the next 30 days.</i> <br><br>  <b>UPD3</b> <br>  Another letter came from the developers.  They received many complaints about overly complex age verification issues, so it was decided to change them.  They sent me 50 new questions for translation, which, in their opinion, are simpler and multicultural.  Script writers added questions with ‚Äúridiculous‚Äù (in fact, no) answer choices, as well as questions with several or even all the correct choices.  At the same time, they sincerely believe that the images from the boxes of American oatmeal, American pop stars, American children's cartoons (checking for adulthood, yeah!) And the evening American TV shows are known all over the world. <br><br>  Russian-speaking players do not have to worry, I transferred almost all the same questions that I did initially - adapted and partially taken from the T &amp; J tube translation.  It was necessary only to change those of them where there is more than one correct answer. <br><br>  <b>The most important thing!</b>  Localization release promise early next week.  First PC / Mac / Linux and Android.  This priority is because Google wants to add the game to favorites in its store, but puts forward its own requirements.  By the way, because of this, the patch was delayed, but all the required chips are about to be ready.  Just refer to this forecast with a little indulgence, the guys love to break deadlines. <br><br>  <b>UPD4</b> <br>  In mid-September, the Russian version got to Google Play <br><br>  <b>UPD5</b> <br>  The Russian version appeared five months later on Steam and on iOS.  Have a nice game! <br></div></div></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/177933/">https://habr.com/ru/post/177933/</a></p>
