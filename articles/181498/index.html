      There were people in the room, behind whom were many implemented projects in various industries - banking, construction, logistics, manufacturing, consulting, and IT.  Moreover, two of them had a <a href="http://www.pmi.org/Certification/Project-Management-Professional-PMP.aspx">PMP</a> certificate, and one was preparing for certification. <br><br> <a href=""><img alt="Sasha talks about PMBOK" src="http://www.pmdoc.ru/wp-content/uploads/1621_496728083734371_1676717304_n1.jpg" width="625" height="416"></a>  To begin with, they remembered the theory of project management.  We found preamu training on <a href="http://www.pmi.org/PMBOK-Guide-and-Standards/Standards-Library-of-PMI-Global-Standards.aspx">PMBOK</a> , appointed Sasha the rapporteur, who was just preparing for the delivery of <a href="http://www.pmi.org/Certification/Project-Management-Professional-PMP.aspx">PMP</a> .  He has the freshest memories, and it is useful not only to read before the exam, but also to retell what you read.  They listened, supplemented, asked questions and vied with each other answered. <br><br>  Fine!  The theory was refreshed. <br><br>  Now attention!  The goal of the project is to climb one of the two thousandths of the Ukrainian Carpathians.  Pause ... No one jumped?  No, still here! <a name="habracut"></a>  Then we have 4 options: Hoverla (2,061 meters), Brebeneskul (2,035 meters; and next to it there are two more 2,000 people below ‚Äî Gutin Tomnatic and Ribs), Pop Ivan of Chernogorsky (2,021 meters), Petros (2,020 meters).  After the microdiscussion, Petros was unanimously chosen. <br><br>  We are only five people, so we will do 5 documents: <strong>the project charter</strong> , the <strong>Hierarchical Structure of Work</strong> (WBS), the <strong>project schedule</strong> , <strong>the procurement</strong> <strong>management plan and the communication management plan</strong> .  Everyone is responsible for one document, but we do preliminary work together. <br><br>  Organized a shared folder on <a href="http://drive.google.com/">Google Drive</a> .  We threw back the necessary templates for <a title="OSUP.Komplekt.v5" href="http://www.pmdoc.ru/%3Fpage_id%3D21">OSUP.komplekta</a> and began the study.  The first document is the <strong>charter of the project</strong> .  The project was called " <em>Petros Jo-Ho-Ho</em> " and began to fill in the following sections: <br><ol><li>  Project Justification <br>  ‚Ä¢ The desire to gain and improve project management skills in practice; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Getting pleasure from a healthy and active lifestyle. </li><li>  Measurable project objectives and relevant success criteria <br>  ‚Ä¢ Climb to Petros (height 2020 m).  The criterion is a photo of a height mark or a photo with GPS coordinates and a height indicator. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Find crocuses, in case they are on the way (¬± 300m in the radius of the route).  The criterion is a photo of crocuses with one of the project participants. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Video clip on the results of the campaign.  The criterion is a video clip with a duration of 3-5 minutes. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Finalized project documentation.  The criterion is the documents of the project are collected in PDF format and approved by e-mail by all participants of the project. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Pass the Project Integration Exam at <a href="http://www.pmdoc.ru/">www.pmdoc.ru</a> .  The criterion is 61% correct answers. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Give praise to the gods of project management by eating a ram washing it down with wine.  Criterion - the remnants of the sheep + empty glasses. </li><li>  High Level Requirements <br>  ‚Ä¢ Return home healthy and happy; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Lead an expedition after hours; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Use cloud solutions as tools. </li><li>  Project Assumptions <br>  ‚Ä¢ We presume that there will be snow in the mountains. </li><li>  Project Restrictions <br>  ‚Ä¢ The total budget should not exceed 1500 UAH.  for 1 participant excluding the purchase of personal equipment. <br>  ‚Ä¢ The ascent of the selected mountain must be completed on Saturday. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Download participants for work and home. </li><li>  High level risks <br>  ‚Ä¢ Weather conditions that will not allow climbing. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Domestic, family and work concerns that will prevent participation in the expedition. <br>  ‚Ä¢ The state of health of the participants, which does not allow climbing. </li><li>  Budget Expenditures <br>  ‚Ä¢ Transport <br>  ‚Ä¢ Nutrition <br>  ‚Ä¢ Accommodation <br>  ‚Ä¢ Equipment </li><li>  Requirements for project approval.  A project is considered successful if: <br>  ‚Ä¢ The team has achieved <strong>the</strong> goals specified in <strong>the project charter</strong> ; <br>  ‚Ä¢ The team verbally confirmed the success of the project. </li></ol><br><br>  The second document is the <strong>Hierarchical Work Structure</strong> (WBS).  Actually, here it is: <br><br> <a href=""><img alt="The structure of the preparation and conduct of the expedition" src="http://www.pmdoc.ru/wp-content/uploads/7PMS.1.1.2.----_20130424.gif" width="410" height="433"></a> <br><br>  The third document is the <strong>project schedule</strong> .  In order not to soar your brain and not to waste time on organizing the <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/ru-ru/project/FX103802061.aspx">server MS Project</a> , we took the already well-proven cloud project management system <a href="http://www.smartsheet.com/">Smartsheet Project Management</a> .  Convenient interface, teamwork, connection from anywhere in the world, you do not need to install anything - all through the browser.  Everyone got access.  Kohl received the role of the project administrator, immediately transferred the WBS structure to the schedule and began to fill it.  Since there were constantly ideas about what needs to be done before the ascent, the schedule was filled during the entire Kickoff Meeting. <br><br>  The remaining two documents <strong>, the Procurement</strong> <strong>Management Plan and the Communication Management Plan, were</strong> only discussed.  Fill did not.  Yura was put in charge for the ‚Äúpurchases‚Äù, and me was responsible for the ‚Äúcommunications‚Äù. <br><br>  But the most important thing is that they got so carried away that they bought tickets to Ivano-Frankivsk and back through the UkrZaliznytsya website, without leaving the office.  Yura is traveling from Odessa, the rest from Kiev.  In general, they worked fruitfully and with an excellent mood and anticipation of an interesting project and ascents diverged. <br><br><h2>  Training </h2><br><br>  Sasha organized a group in <a href="http://www.skype.com/ru">Skype</a> , so that video conferences could be held.  Invitations for conferencing were sent via <a href="http://www.google.com/calendar">Google Calendar</a> .  Once in 3-4 days we connected in the evenings for half an hour and recorded the progress of the project development.  If someone slowed down the training, he received an e-kick. <br><br>  Between konfolls, we systematically, in time free from idleness, performed the tasks of the project, noted the implementation of <a href="http://www.smartsheet.com/">Smartsheet</a> , updated documents on <a href="http://drive.google.com/">Google Drive</a> , picked up the missing equipment, looked for transfer contacts Ivano-Frankivsk - Kvasy and lodging for the night, was engaged in procurement, found information on the KCC forestry, transport, docking.  Preparing, I mean, in every way. <br><br> <a href=""><img alt="Procurement Management Plan" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e65/6d4/089/e656d408998956a80936c066f375aa77.jpg" width="625" height="416"></a>  <strong>The procurement management plan</strong> described in <a href="http://www.pmi.org/PMBOK-Guide-and-Standards/Standards-Library-of-PMI-Global-Standards.aspx">PMBOK</a> did not <a href="http://www.pmi.org/PMBOK-Guide-and-Standards/Standards-Library-of-PMI-Global-Standards.aspx">suit</a> us at all.  Replaced with an Excel spreadsheet. <br><br>  And so shaky-shaky got to the first major milestones of the project - Go / No-Go Decision.  This is the decision point whether to continue the project further or suspend its implementation, or it may completely abandon the project and stop its implementation. <br><br><h2>  Go / No-Go Decision </h2><br><br>  From a psychological point of view, this is the highlight of the project.  Since even the delivery of the results of the project does not cause as much emotion as the acceptance of responsibility for the decision to move or not to move on, when people's life or health depends on this decision. <br><br>  That's just the moment and came in our project.  Who knew that on the day of the vernal equinox on March 22, 2013, most of Ukraine would be covered with snow with a hurricane wind.  According to the Ukrainian Hydrometeorological Center, for three days (March 22-24), 60 mm of precipitation fell in Kiev, about 55 mm in the northern regions of Ukraine, and 35 mm in the western regions ‚Äî this was not the case for the entire 132-year history of meteorological observations. <br><br>  The classic risk worked - very dangerous and theoretically unbelievable.  The participants of our training were lucky!  Getting into such a situation in an educational project is a great success and an incredible experience. <br><br>  There is one of the most important recommendations in identifying risks in project management: a ban on criticism of ideas.  This is done so that even the unlikely and fantastic risks find their rightful place in the Risk Register.  So we talked about a variety of risks, but none of us could have imagined that the risks would grow to a level that would not allow us to satisfy the most important requirement of the <strong>Charter of</strong> our project - ‚Äú <em>Return home healthy and happy</em> ‚Äù.  According to the control and rescue service of the Carpathians - the mountains of Petros and Hoverla are closed.  There is a lot of snow in the mountains, avalanche danger, plus there is warming.  Of course you can go, but under your personal fear and risk.  At the same time, it is necessary to warn rescuers by phone, but not to catch their eye, otherwise they will be turned back. <br><br>  As a result, it was necessary to determine for which of the restrictions we are leveling this risky event.  According to <a href="http://www.pmi.org/PMBOK-Guide-and-Standards/Standards-Library-of-PMI-Global-Standards.aspx">PMBOK</a> , project management includes balancing the following competing design constraints: <br><br><ul><li>  content; </li><li>  quality; </li><li>  schedule; </li><li>  budget; </li><li>  resources; </li><li>  risks. </li></ul><br><br>  Accordingly, we could: <br><ol><li>  Change the content of the project and climb to a less high and warmer peak.  For example, the mountain Chatyr-Dag in the Crimea (1527 m). </li><li>  To worsen the quality of the project.  For example, to get to with.  Kvass, but Petros does not rise.  Baranchik and wine can be eaten and drunk without lifting. </li><li>  Change the project schedule and climb in May or June. </li><li>  Change the project budget and get to the top in another way, for example, by helicopter. </li><li>  Get more resources, so that at least someone returned alive (: </li></ol><br> <a href=""><img alt="Chatyr-dag" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7a2/e3f/9a0/7a2e3f9a077ecf5f452d2dfefcc7f65d.jpg" width="625" height="294"></a>  Most of the votes have chosen the first option. <br><br>  Well?  We are going to the Crimea!  And we compensate for the missing 500 meters in the height of Chatyr-Dag in the summer with a rise to the Bulgarian Musala.  The height of this mountain is 2925 meters, which is 425 meters higher than we need for the second peak. <br><br>  True, during this Go / No-Go Decision, we still lost two fighters.  Yura under the pretext of the lack of tickets from Odessa to Simferopol, leveled his wife‚Äôs outrage at his ‚Äúidle‚Äù study of project management, and refused to go.  Kohl, in whose worldview there is a share of healthy fatalism, scored on an expedition, citing the lack of money for additional payments for tickets. <br><br>  And so, in a small group of three, we moved forward. <br><br><h2>  Expedition </h2><br><br>  On April 12, they were going limply and loosely.  When I left 15 minutes before leaving the apartment, I remembered that I had downloaded maps for the navigator at work, but I left the laptop in the office.  We had to quickly torrent Torrent and download them at home, slowly writing to the gadget via USB, as a result of which we froze at a run on the subway.  Along the way, I remembered that I also printed out the cards and honestly forgot them at home.  But if we return for them, we‚Äôll be late for the train.  Well, well - no map to the mountains - project managers, shit ... <br><br>  So quietly swearing, we went to the subway, and then ran to the train.  I called Sasha, who had been trampling around the car for a long time (we had tickets) and nervously gnawed at his nails, clarified from which side our car.  As a result, ran the other way - communication, fuck ... <br><br>  Five minutes before the departure of the train, we ran so vapidly into the car, honestly telling Sana that we never do that, that we prepare for everything in advance, and in general we are very punctual people! <br><br>  And we drove to the Crimea! <br><br>  Sanya slept all night in the next compartment in a company with big big-bellied guys.  They tried to get him drunk, but Sasha otmazatsya, not accidentally making his bed and giving it to one of the paunchy.  After that, they are behind him.  But snoring at night is notable! <br>  The morning was sunny, joyful.  Ira got up from the coupe and said: <br>  - Oh, my arm hurt here all night, - pointing to the wrist, and I: <br>  - And I was right there in the same leg.  So let's get it! <br><br>  We arrived in Simferopol at the beginning of the eleventh.  First, they ran into <a href="http://www.vertikal.crimea.ua/">the Vertical</a> store - buy a card and check in with the <a href="http://www.kss.crimea.ua/">KCC</a> .  The map was bought, failed to be noted, because  it is necessary to get in touch with them in advance, and then to be noted in the store - delirium!  But they bought a wonderful <a href="http://www.jetboil.com/">JetBoil</a> mug! <br><br>  We got into a minibus and drove towards the pass - to the tourist station (s / s) Sosnovka - there was the start of our ascent. <br><br>  Oh, how good it is that we changed our tickets and went to Crimea instead of the Carpathians.  The sun, birds, flowers - beauty!  And the weather on Goverla in those days - snow, rain, fog - is shorter than Kaka! <br><br>  Staranuv at s / s Sosnovka around 12:00 we climbed the lower plateau of Chatyr-Dag by two o'clock in the afternoon.  They were not in a hurry, crawling through the cloud, met with local Turikov, who wandered around the neighborhood, collected garbage and wild garlic.  We, too, enjoyed garlic - vitamins, and even naturally grown! <br><br>  At the beginning of the third we were on m / s Point.  I wanted to eat (manil garlic), so we drank a cup of instant soup with garlic, ate sandwiches with pate and washed down with tea.  I picked up the iron cup, and a napkin stuck to it and hangs. <br>  - Ha!  Saw how can I!  Shaman!  I even gravity how much! <br>  Sasha picks up his cup from the table, but he had nothing under the cup, and, accordingly, nothing stuck: <br>  - And I have nothing ... <br>  - What are you, the table wanted to raise? <br><br>  They devoured, neighing and went to settle in the room allocated to us (75 UAH per person), threw things into it and went to conquer the upper Chatyr-Dag. <br><br>  Spring flowers grow around the plateau.  For the purposes of the project, there was a small sub-goal - to find crocuses and photograph them.  But there was a lot of sleep-grass, but Ira found the crocuses already on the upper plateau of Chatyr-Dag - small, stunted and frozen. <br><br>  The clouds fled down to the valley and the tender spring sunshine delighted us throughout the entire ascent - even sweating fairly.  About five o'clock we went up to the first summit - Angar-Burun.  From her beautiful views of the North and South Dimerzhi opened, the mountains floated above the clouds that covered the bottom of the Alushta Valley. <br><br>  After a short rest, we went towards the town of Eklizi-Burun - in fact, this is the highest point of the Chatyr-Dag massif - 1527 m. Sasha decided not to smoke on the march, so his young parasitic organism always wanted to eat, which he actively did. <br><br> <a href=""><img alt="On the top" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8e0/43d/1e5/8e043d1e575723ecd94dec231176fdd5.jpg" width="625" height="416"></a>  By six o'clock in the evening we climbed to the top, which was witnessed in the photo. <br><br>  Ah, such a wonderful sunset was that evening, I did not want to go down.  And it is necessary, and urgently - to the camp 4 km, and we are still at the top. <br><br>  In general, we jumped down, and the sun also rolled over the horizon, and clearly faster than us ... <br><br>  For two hours we walked in the twilight along the path, which was becoming worse and worse with every minute.  Moreover, we took a different path than going up.  Due to the fact that at the last moment I recorded a map on the navigator, we followed the deviation of our route. <br><br>  It was dumb to go into the wooded ravines, which led the trail.  But there was no fear, because behind is a great landmark - the stone-head Chatyr-Dag, blackening against the background of the starry sky, and in front you can see the valley, which was illuminated by the night Simferopol.  So our camp is on the right. <br>  In short, somehow we drove to the orphanage - Iru was barely carried by the legs ... Naras with a mattress and a pillow, delivered an indelible impression that evening! <br><br>  As we climbed Chatyr-Dag, we thought that in the morning we‚Äôll blow ourselves up early and go shoot the dawn.  Aha  We were so exhausted, wandering through the night plateau, bushes and ravines, that in the morning we were up to eight o'clock.  What a dawn?  We have a sunset with more than enough! <br><br>  After breakfast we went in the direction of the Marble Cave - we decided to look at this miracle of nature and go down to the highway to catch the train. <br><br>  To visit the Miracle of Nature, I had to wait a couple more wanting to visit it, then listen to the specific humor of the guide, pay 90 UAH for watching and listening.  Sasha for this money still managed to feel and cuddle with each stalactite and stalagmite ... <br><br>  Having emerged from the bowels of the earth and inhaled ozone, we set off along a path winding along power lines to the village of Marble.  But something I didn‚Äôt like this path with Sasha, and we turned onto the next track, made by jeeps, in the hope that it would lead us to the track faster.  Well, that project management taxis!  And we laid on contingency reserves - there was time in stock !!! <br>  The rut led, led, and then somehow ended abruptly.  We first rested in a beam and impassable shrub.  Then they came back and decided to go around the bushes by traversing the next hill.  But to get around the bushes, it does not mean to climb this mountain !!!  I love to climb into such ebenya, which then takes your breath away when you get out of them or come down from them ... <br><br>  In short, everybody climbed behind me, and then they thought better of it and still walked along the trail, but lower than me - after all, you still have to somehow roll down - there was no path!  So with swears, jokes and stumble we walked around the beam with the forest and saw below some dome-shaped structure, and from it a road winding along the rocks.  Hooray!  Soon this horror will end with shaking knees and an ass aiming to fall into the gorge! <br><br>  The domed structure turned out to be a protected object - the exit from the cliff of an underground river.  The purest flow of drinking water just breaks out of the bowels of the earth. <br><br>  The men, like mountain goats, galloped forward and attacked the object from nowhere.  The guard was surprised, reached for the weapon, said that there is a sanitary zone here and it is forbidden to be here.  Ah, sanitary!  There you are! <br><br>  All the way down I collected plastic bottles, scattered eblanami. <br>  - Here, dudes, I, as a real ecologist, collected garbage from a mountain above the river. <br><br>  The dudes got the bag, overloaded the bottles from my backpack into the bag and told how to bypass the next post, which is even better guarded.  They explained where to turn in order to cross the river and walk along unguarded territory. <br><br>  And Ira was trudging somewhere behind her, the forces were leaving her.  Having practically reached the dome-shaped structure, she saw that we were already hanging out with the guards with might and main, and she stupidly could not get off the last stone.  He was slippery, his legs were moving down, and he no longer had the strength to hold on.  In short, Ira screamed at the top of her lungs.  I came running, but I was late - under the force of gravity, she somehow slipped off this Kamenyuki, said she didn‚Äôt want to see me, spread tears and snot on my face, and proudly went down the road.  She was accompanied by two pairs of guard eyes. <br>  - Hello!  - She said as a decent traveler, and not as some kind of zachuha, crawled out of the bushes, all in snot and with cracked legs. <br>  - Where is she?  The guard asked me. <br>  - She walks slowly, so went ahead. <br><br>  We took water straight from the river and ran after Ira.  We caught up with her on time - she was already on the road, which is forbidden for tourists to walk.  Passing a secret bridge across the river, they met with pensioners from Simferopol, collectors of spring mushrooms and herbs, hurrying to the trolleybus.  Oh, we are on the way!  And we together trotted behind them. <br><br>  Everything was fine, but it began to rain, which turned into a very heavy downpour.  We were soaked to the skin, to the pants and to the laces.  The tooth on a tooth did not get!  Arriving by bus to the railway station half an hour before the train departure, we left Sasha to change clothes and guard clothes, and they rushed for hot meat, cakes and cognac.  Not a lamb, of course, and not wine.  But praise to the gods of project management turned out! <br><br>  We got wet and tired into the train, changed our clothes, ate and ‚Äúpraised‚Äù, and most importantly - we achieved all our goals: climbed up the mountain, Crocuses found, stayed alive and healthy and happy no matter what! <br><br><h2>  Experience lessons </h2><br><br>  Everyone, even deserters Yura and Kohl, participated in summing up the lessons of experience. <br><br>  The document ‚Äú <strong>Lessons of Experience</strong> ‚Äù contains the causes of problems and deviations, the rationale for choosing one or another corrective action and other knowledge accumulated during the project implementation.  The accumulated knowledge is documented in the form of documents throughout the entire life cycle of a project (but necessarily, at least during the project completion process) in order to become part of the historical database for this project as well as future expeditions. <br><br>  Received the following changes: <br><table><tbody><tr><th>  Change </th><th>  Justification </th></tr><tr><td>  Corrected one of the main goals of the project - the summit and even the mountain range. <br>  Petros was changed to Chatyr-Dag (Carpathians in Crimea) </td><td>  Extreme avalanche danger in the Carpathians. <br>  Risks have grown to a level that did not allow us to satisfy the most important requirement of our <strong>Charter</strong> - ‚ÄúTo return home healthy and happy.‚Äù  It was necessary to determine at the expense of which of the restrictions we remove the risk constraint.  Chose to change the content.  We decided to climb a less high and warmer peak of Chatyr-Dag in the Crimea (1527 m). </td></tr><tr><td>  Changed Kiev-Ivano-Frankivsk tickets to Kiev-Simferopol </td><td>  In connection with the change of the top. </td></tr><tr><td>  Two members of the expedition refused to hike </td><td>  The risk "Social obligations" worked.  One did not let his wife, the second type did not have enough money. </td></tr><tr><td>  Procurement plan changed </td><td>  Change of direction of movement (delivery of purchased tickets, purchase of new ones), revision of the meal plan, the composition of the necessary personal and general equipment, rental equipment.  In general, despite the changes, the specified constraint on the cost of the project is maintained. </td></tr><tr><td>  Changed communication plan </td><td>  Search for new contacts (rescue services, place to sleep, etc.) </td></tr><tr><td>  Lamb is replaced by chicken, and wine by brandy </td><td>  Due to the fact that the team blundered in the mountains, there was no time left for a restaurant in front of the train.  Moreover, the team got into heavy rain and no one wanted the wine.  I wanted brandy! <br>  We bought grilled chicken and a bottle of brandy and sacrificed it all to the gods of project management by eating into ourselves. </td></tr></tbody></table><br>  Recommendations to the second peak and to other groups for the first: <br><ol><li>  If possible, reduce the time of preparation and ascent: This will reduce the likelihood of "losing" team members due to financial, social and healthy risks.  A longer time interval is an increase in the likelihood of unforeseen external and internal factors, from weather changes to legislation and the attitude of the team. </li><li>  Money for a hike to collect immediately, after the Kickoff Meeting, to exclude the refusal to participate in the climb due to "unforeseen financial expenses." </li><li>  Create a single page of a single project, you can <a href="http://www.google.com/">google</a> , it would be very convenient and would eliminate the prevailing mess with accounts and repositories.  This is very important in the virtual management of the project team. </li></ol><br> <a href=""><img alt="Forward to new heights!" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/232/ade/6be/232ade6be78b1be89cdb95e226361494.jpg" width="625" height="416"></a> <br>  Documentation of the described expedition can be found here: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/7PMSummits/files">www.facebook.com/groups/7PMSummits</a> <br>  <strong>Do you want to participate in the following training expeditions - <a href="">write to me</a> .</strong> <br><br>  <i>Article author: Anatoly Savin <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/anatolysavin/" class="user_link">anatolysavin</a> , Profect Management Profy</i> <br><br><hr>  <a href="http://training.muk.ua/courses/project-management-institute/">Project Management Project Management Training Courses</a> <br><br><hr><br>  <a href="http://www.service.muk.ua/">MUK-Service - all types of IT repair: warranty, non-warranty repair, sale of spare parts, contract service</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/181498/">https://habr.com/ru/post/181498/</a></p>
