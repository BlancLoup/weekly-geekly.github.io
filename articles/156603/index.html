  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Smart home as a hobby</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="http://servicerem.ru/Umdom/2.jpeg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  It all started with the fact that UD considered the era of the future.  And I decided to do something useful every day.  For the first two months I read articles about UD and determined which functions I needed and which bus I would use.  In the end, chose the <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/1-Wire">1wire</a> bus. <br><br>  The Benux software was purchased in Ukraine from a programmer, he also provided remote assistance in switching equipment.  Sent equipment with codes purchased from him to activate devices.  These were: a humidity sensor, a temperature sensor, an input / output sensor (for receiving signals from dry-contact sensors such as reed switches, motion, smoke, etc.) and 220-volt load control.  Subsequently, we had to order the equipment ourselves, which caused some problems and long time delays, since I don‚Äôt understand anything in electronics.  And began a long evening proceedings with software (software) and electronics.  Everything was created in stages, with the increase of new functions of the system, through additional software. <br>  The whole system is built on a computer with a 1 wire DS9490R bus adapter connected to it.  The equipment is connected using twisted pair or telephone wire.  Consistently or better common bus with branches. <br><br><h1>  Stages </h1><br><h2>  1. Sensors </h2><br>  Installed temperature sensors, humidity, I / O, power management. <br>  Received temperature control for turning on and off the heater, the ability to determine movement in the room, turning on the photo frame when someone is in the apartment, turning on and off various sources of lighting.

Optional monitor </h2><br>  When I figured out with the sensors, it became clear that with the help of additional software one could achieve greater functionality of the entire system.  Information about the temperature and button assignments from the control panel was displayed on the monitor.  Subsequently, the best solution was the photo frame, which was included only if someone was at home. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a1e/f9a/337/a1ef9a337e2ebcb78c8c5b1d1c2888ae.jpg" width="168" height="300"><br>  The monitor is used as a photo frame. <br><br><h2>  3. Remote control. </h2><br>  It turned out to be very important to supplement the management system.  After searching the Internet for the most adaptable option, there was a circuit connected via a COM port and able to receive signals after learning from any console.  In the presence of the remote was a receiver from the Yamaha RX-V559, it became obvious good to manage the UD already existing sound. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/26a/f84/d7c/26af84d7c58f8339f1903d04a527f218.jpg" width="168" height="300"><br>  Already available remote <br>  Downstairs receiver at the top of the home computer <br>  Infrared receiver <br><br>  Everything seemed simple, but in practice it was not so easy to tie up the management.  The first thing you need is the WinLirc driver, and then there will probably be a separate topic on the software used and the link between it. <br>  In practice, I was able to turn the light on and off, both at a single point and all at once, and also turn the computer on and off.  Divided into ‚ÄúIncoming‚Äù modes (the light in the room is turned on, the computer is turned on, the voice greeting and the speaking time), ‚ÄúCare‚Äù (everything is turned off, including the computer and the system goes into security mode) <br><br><h2>  4. GSM management. </h2><br>  Such management has long become commonplace, all alarms can work via cellular communication.  I bought the gateway and everything started almost immediately. <br>  In practice, he was able to control the DD through the phone.  I can turn on and off the light, the computer, water the flowers, get information from the sensors of humidity, temperature, movement, etc ... <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d09/2bb/7c9/d092bb7c98d074fe38fb6680d6fbd6d5.jpg" width="168" height="300"><br>  Black box GSM gateway installed inside the computer case <br>  Antenna for gateway <br><br><h2>  5. Automation. </h2><br>  The software implementation available in the Benux program allowed the timer to be turned on and off by the timer, and ‚ÄúScheduled Tasks‚Äù from Windows XP were also used. <br>  Anti-theft - randomly turning on and off the light in the rooms for the illusion of the owners of the house, watering the flowers on a timer and more. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/fe0/b5f/227/fe0b5f227dacb8caed1adcf75583b4ce.jpg" width="168" height="300"><br>  20 liter bucket with pump inside. <br>  Piping system to the pots.  Distributors have 3 different water capacities. <br><br><h2>  6. Speakers for smart home. </h2><br>  The last function was to add speakers to the overall system. <br>  In the morning, pleasant music wakes up, which gradually increases, and when you leave the house, time says.  When the ‚ÄúArrival‚Äù mode is turned on, the speech synthesizer pronounces the greeting, the current date and time. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/794/491/4ae/7944914ae03300f5b782ef02bf9c6740.jpg" width="168" height="300"><br>  4-way power amplifier <br>  2 such <br>  And 2 such <br><br><h2>  7.

Server - just a computer </h2><br>  The computer itself, which acts as a server for the UD, as well as a storage and working around the clock. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2c2/a75/b33/2c2a75b33d05eecea86d18279a43a2c0.jpg" width="168" height="300"><br>  Used port <br>  Web <br>  Schemes that helped quickly remember <br><br>  Video shot a year ago, something has already changed <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/dAIvq3543xs%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,1500001,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700255,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhjbhiv4yfTeRqFIQgZ2xZ_VtC9IYw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Initially, the goal was to make the UD, but in the process of work it turned out that the price of such UD was 20 times cheaper than when buying branded equipment, not to mention the installation by the company.  Of course, I wanted to sell a smart home, but it became clear that this is impossible for one person, since it requires a high stability of the final product, a sales type and good software support, he is a system administrator himself.  Perhaps there are still people interested in long-term employment, ready for long-term cooperation, with programming or electronics skills, living in the Kharkiv region. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/156603/">https://habr.com/ru/post/156603/</a></p>
