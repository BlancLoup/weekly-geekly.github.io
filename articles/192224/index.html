      <i>UPDATE!</i>  <i>It is very likely that the reduction will not be until two percent, but to zero - see update number 3 at the end of the post.</i> <br><br>  Well, who asked there, from what distract our attention?  <i>Here was a bitter smile with a wry grin.</i> <br><br>  To whom it is interesting / not indifferent, welcome under the cut! <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  So, pruflinka.  Yes, there is such a law, just quiet-silent.  Right mouse under the broom. <br><ul><li>  <a href="http://www.garant.ru/hotlaw/federal/433271/">Overview of the document 243-FZ on the Garant system website</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://base.consultant.ru/cons/cgi/online.cgi%3Freq%3Ddoc%3Bbase%3DLAW%3Bn%3D138563">The text of the law on the website of the "Consultant"</a> </li></ul><br>  To understand what we are talking about, we clarify the terminology.  What are pension savings made of and how are they used? <br><br>  Let's go to the official website of the Pension Fund of the Russian Federation (I quote from the page for <a href="http://www.pfrf.ru/pensions/">Future Pensioners</a> ): <br><ol><li>  <u>Insurance part</u>  ‚ÄúThe funds of the insurance part of your future pension are fixed on your individual personal account and are annually indexed by the state ... <i>Physically, this money is used to pay pensions to current pensioners</i> .‚Äù </li><li>  <u>Cumulative part</u> .  ‚ÄúThe funds of the funded part of your future pension are accounted for by the FIU in a special part of your individual personal account.  According to your decision, they are transferred to one of the management companies or a non-state pension fund for investment. ‚Äù </li></ol><br>  With the insurance part, everything seems to be clear.  Allied money is long gone, we support the current retirees. <br><br>  The cumulative part raises much more questions.  How will it be used when paying pensions to us, what can be done with it when you reach retirement age?  Digging further: <a href="http://www.pfrf.ru/investing/">On pension savings</a> .  There you can also download the text of the law No. 360- <a href="http://www.pfrf.ru/userdata/zakonodatelstvo/fz_360.doc">On the procedure for financing payments from pension savings</a> . <br><br>  I will not overload the post with quotations, I will take only the starting point. <br><blockquote>  Article 2. Types of payments made at the expense of pension savings <br><br>  The following types of payments are made at the expense of pension savings formed in favor of the insured person: <br>  1) a one-time payment of pension savings (hereinafter - a one-time payment); <br>  2) urgent pension payment; <br>  3) the cumulative part of the old-age retirement pension; <br>  4) payment of pension savings to successors of the deceased insured person. <br><br>  Section 3. Exercise of the right of the insured person to payments at the expense of pension savings <br>  &lt;...&gt; <br>  3. The amount of payments specified in Clauses 1 - 3 of Article 2 of this Federal Law is determined based on the amount of pension savings accounted for in the special part of the individual personal account or on the pension account of the funded part of the insured person‚Äôs retirement pension on the day from which the corresponding type is assigned payments. </blockquote><br>  Total: <br><ul><li>  There are several pension payment schemes. </li><li>  they all depend on the funded part </li><li>  possible inheritance of pension savings </li></ul><br>  The first and last points for me were a complete revelation.  The issue will have to be studied in more detail, despite the fact that laws are not written for people. <br><br>  Again.  The amount of pension payments depends on the funded part of the pension and can be inherited.  In a rough approximation, this part can be considered as a bank deposit (with certain conditions for receiving money). <br><br>  What carries us the federal law number 243 in this context?  Nothing special, we just gathered on the sly to take away two-thirds of this contribution.  In old age, we will be more dependent on the <s>mercy of the state of the</s> insurance part of the pension and we will be able to leave our relatives less.  Even now, many people don‚Äôt believe in the pension system, but we are talking about concrete money and take this money from us now. <br><br>  There are a lot of those who have never heard of these reforms, whose money will now go to the benefit of the FIU.  Here <a href="http://law21.ru/2013/01/25/nakopitelnaya-chast-pensii-kak-soxranit-6">we</a> counted 162 billion rubles a year.  It seems to me that the amount is too big to cover the deficit in the pension budget.  But this question will be interesting rather RosPilu and his ilk. <br><br>  <b>The purpose of this post</b> is a collective search for the most profitable solution for each of us.  The review of the Guarantor offers two options: transfer funds to non-state pension funds or choose a management company.  It would seem that we are given only two alternatives, either to dump from the FIU or to agree to reduce the funded part. <br><br>  However, in the very letter that gave impetus to this post, there were such lines <blockquote>  So, by the end of the year (until 12/31/13) you need to go to the district FIU with a passport and a pension certificate and write an application for keeping the interest the same.  &lt;...&gt; If you are told that an application form is not developed, ask to accept your application in the form in which you write it, they must accept it.  An approximate text could be: ‚ÄúFrom 01/01/2014, I ask the size of deductions for the cumulative part of the labor pension to be left at 6%‚Äù. </blockquote><br><br>  Interestingly, the <a href="http://www.pfrf.ru/ot_krasyar/pr_releases/55595.html">press release of the</a> pension fund seems to confirm this option <blockquote>  If the ‚Äúsilent people‚Äù want to keep the cumulative tariff in the amount of 6%, during 2013 they need to write a corresponding application to the PFR on the redistribution or transfer of pension savings funds to the NPF or the Criminal Code. </blockquote><br><br>  Let's think habrazhiteli.  Let's think! <br><br>  <b>UPD</b> Continuing the theme of the post from <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/damaks/" class="user_link">Damaks</a> : <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/192306/">"</a> <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/damaks/" class="user_link">Choosing a</a> <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/192306/">Non-State Pension Fund - the theory and comparison</a> . <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/192306/">"</a> <br>  Here we would have such a review on management companies ... <br><br>  <b>UPD2</b> Useful link on the FIU website: <a href="http://www.pfrf.ru/tarif_nakop/">options for action and sample applications</a> <br><br>  <b>UPD3 The</b> <a href="http://ria.ru/society/20130917/963786313.html">Cabinet of Ministers decided to reset the funded part of the pension for the ‚Äúsilent‚Äù</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/192224/">https://habr.com/ru/post/192224/</a></p>
