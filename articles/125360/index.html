  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Terms of Reference</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In most large organizations, intra-company ‚Äúuser-department IT‚Äù relations are inevitable, especially when creating business applications that the user needs on an ongoing basis.  The complexity of these relations may be due to many factors, but most often this is a misunderstanding that arises from the fact that the parties speak different ‚Äúlanguages‚Äù with different terminology.  The user understands what he wants, but cannot articulate it, the IT specialist understands the user, but fears that the result will be different than the first one sees.  Most often, the problem begins with the fact that the user is not ready for the dialogue: he requires ‚Äúso that it works‚Äù, ‚Äúreport with one button‚Äù, ‚Äúso that it appears in a minute‚Äù, ‚Äúso that the dates do not come out in Excel‚Äù and so on.  At the same time, he is not at all interested in how this is done and what mechanisms work.  On the statements about the server load, requests to draw a diagram of the desired result, to discuss solutions, the user does not respond, believing that a true professional will cope with everything.  The results of such a misunderstanding harm the entire production process: the deadlines for solving problems are delayed, errors and gaps in the systems that the user needs are suffering, the server suffers with incorrect actions, and the speed of work decreases. <br><br>  One of the ways to resolve such a conflict is to write a project assignment - a technical assignment, which assumes a full and accurate statement of the requirements of the internal customer and is a kind of instruction for the IT specialist. <a name="habracut"></a>  However, not every user is able to express their thoughts correctly and intelligibly. <br>  I will give a few tips for writing the correct task by the user, according to which you can work and which forms the basis of the relationship between the decision-maker and the specialist. <br><br>  1. Before composing a technical task, the <i>user must understand what exactly he wants to receive</i> .  It is necessary to determine the purpose of the task, the key features of the desired result, draw (write, create a table) for yourself the desired output of work.

      2. <i>Collect documentation</i> according to which you are doing work for which an application (program) is needed.  Read it carefully, with a pencil, noting the features and subtleties. <br><br>  3. You should understand <i>what parameters should be set at the input</i> , how often the desired program works (report, application, utility), how much data will be obtained at the output and whether they are all needed (for example, if you need the amount of revenue from sales of five product categories into categories without titles, you should not require the creation of a report in a million lines indicating each sale with detailed characteristics).  Not every specialist needs the most detailed information, the processing of which creates a significant load for computing systems. <br><br>  4. <i>Describe in detail the necessary information</i> , indicate its features, exceptions, the necessary level of detail.  You should think about all the little things: the format of numbers, rounding, shares, rates, and so on. <br><br>  5. <i>Get rid of the technical assignment of vague descriptions</i> , unnecessary words, words, parasites.  Check punctuation - often errors in it distort the meaning of the task.  The task for the project is a document and the vocabulary in it must be appropriate.  However, you should not try to write everything in a technical language, if you do not know the terminology at the proper level. <br><br>  6. <i>Discuss the written assignment with the actual performer</i> , try to resolve all issues, carefully listening to the opinion of the interlocutor.  Do not forget that you know your field of activity better and only you can explain exactly what tool you need to work effectively.  IT-specialist knows his business and is not obliged to know the nuances of the work of each department in the organization. <br><br>  7. To transfer the <i>task to work within a reasonable time</i> before the final implementation, so that it is possible to test the result and correct possible errors. <br><br>  8. If your subordinates will also use the created application, try to <i>explain</i> to them yourself <i>how to work with the application</i> - this will save the IT specialist from having to explain the same thing a hundred times. <br><br>  9. Remember that your assignment will serve as a guide for you - in it you can always see the description of the information, remember the forgotten requirement. <br><br>  Of course, only the ability to write terms of reference will not get rid of all the problems, but it will allow relations with the IT department to move into a serious plane of cooperation, allow the user to improve their technical literacy and get the required, and an IT specialist will relieve you of a number of problems and unnecessary questions. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/125360/">https://habr.com/ru/post/125360/</a></p>
