  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Who owns Bynet?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I think that it is no secret to anyone in Bynet that for a long time the Open Contact LLC, which served as the technical administrator of the .by zone, was also the largest squatter of the zone.  All more or less valuable domain names, free for a certain date or vacated, fell into the stop list of "Open Contact". <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  This stop list included keywords such as auto.by, travel.by, sport.by, sex.by.  It is clear that to hide this fact after the transfer of the functions of a technical administrator and the opening of the whois service would be difficult, and Open Contract LLC was to find a way out of the current situation.  Perhaps they decided that the best way out would be the mass release of these domains and their registration by everyone, perhaps the mass release and registration for nominees, perhaps I am mistaken in my speculation, and the mass release of beautiful domains this summer was just an accident.  However, it happened.  From the end of July until the end of August 2011, in the .by zone, there was a massive release of beautiful and previously inaccessible domain names for registration.  At the end of August of this year, the registration of these domains was suspended by the OAC, the approved, but unpaid applications were canceled, unsolicited applications began to be denied registration, and an article appeared on TUT.by under the heading <a href="http://news.tut.by/it/246565.html">‚ÄúOAC suppressed the leakage of more than half a thousand‚Äú beautiful ‚Äù.BY domains abroad</a> . <a href="http://news.tut.by/it/246565.html">"</a> <br><br>  I decided to find out the fate of these domain names at the moment.  So, Open Contact Ltd. remains one of the largest squatters in the zone, having in its portfolio, among other domains, such as avto.by, dostavka.by, gazeta.by, hosting.by, motor.by, reklama. by, remont.by, stroika.by, supermarket.by, at.by, go.by, my.by, car.by, cars.by, auto.by, autos.by, life.by, live.by, money.by, music.by, news.by, info.by, sex.by, motor.by, market.by, abc.by, art.by, club.by, email.by, in.by, sale. by.  Another major squatter now is a certain individual, in whose hands are concentrated the domains audio.by, blog.by, da.by, forum.by, novosti.by, poisk.by, radio.by, super.by, tv.by , vodka.by, video.by, do.by, price.by, by.by, time.by, good.by, help.by, play.by, city.by, book.by, books.by, baby .by, search.by, travel.by, au.by, xx.by, aa.by, bb.by, dating.by, download.by, free.by, game.by, games.by, love.by , people.by, sport.by, top.by, mp3.by and bynet.by.  The rest of the domain names released during that period were registered by smaller players in the domain market. <br><br>  What could be the fate of these domains in the future?  Unpaid and uncreated domains, according to Hoster.by technical support, will be put up for auction after approval of the relevant domain auctioning regulations, it is possible that Open Contact Ltd., either on its own or at the request of the OAC, will also put up its domains for sale through the auction.  But the domains that are registered by private individuals are likely to remain with their current owners, since there are no legal grounds for canceling them and deleting them from the registry, especially some domain names changed owners, what happened, I think, is not free.

      What kind of development of Bynet can we talk about when the best domains were collected in the hands of the technical administrator of the zone at that time?  I doubt that no one (for example, OAC, Hoster.by or someone else) knew that Open Contact LLC does not allow for a long time to register top and simply beautiful domains to third parties, but none of them took no action to prevent this.  I would like to believe that the remaining domain names will not hang forever now in the stop list of the OAC or will go to ‚Äútheir‚Äù people, but will get to an honest auction, will find their rightful owners and will subsequently delight us with good projects. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/132511/">https://habr.com/ru/post/132511/</a></p>
