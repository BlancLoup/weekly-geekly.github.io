      This work is a brief description of a complex consisting of a mobile robot on the Arduino platform, a control system for designing state machines and a protocol for communication between real and virtual robot controllers.  The model of the robot is designed in Solidworks CAD, and you can work with it in the Webots emulation environment.  The article will be useful for beginners and experienced developers who are interested in using an automaton approach to controlling robots. <br><br><hr><br><br><h6>  <a href="http://ntv.ifmo.ru/file/article/859.pdf">The control algorithm of the autonomous two-wheeled mobile robot "Motobot"</a> </h6><br>  <i>(A. A. Bobtsov, A. S. Borgul, K. A. Zimenko, A. A. Pyrkin)</i> <br><br>  Recently, the solution of problems related to the movement of autonomous motorcycles, which are able to move practically in any terrain, has become urgent.  In this work, an analysis of the mathematical model of the movement of the autonomous robot ‚ÄúMotobot‚Äù, which is a miniature two-wheeled motorcycle, is carried out.  It also shows how to stabilize the vertical position of this robot and implement remote control. <br><br><hr><br><br><h6>  <a href="http://ntv.ifmo.ru/file/article/355.pdf">Lego Mindstorms NXT technology in teaching students the basics of adaptive management</a> </h6><br>  <i>(A. A. Bobtsov, Yu. A. Kaptanyuk, A. A. Kapitonov, S. A. Kolyubin, A. A. Pyrkin, S. A. Chepinsky, S. V. Shavetov)</i> <br><br>  Modern youth, as a rule, does not represent where knowledge of mathematics, physics and computer science can be useful.  The authors of this article propose an educational technology in which students must assemble a robot from the Lego Mindstorms NXT designer and, knowing the laws of adaptive control, program the controller that forces the robot to move and avoid obstacles.  The article presents four examples of laboratory work that will increase the attention and interest of students in management theory. <br><br><hr><br><br><h6>  <a href="http://ntv.ifmo.ru/file/article/266.pdf">Analysis of the effectiveness of using the GPU for the automatic synthesis of the mobile robot control system</a> </h6><br>  <i>(A.A. Sergeev, V.O. Kleban, A.A. Shalyto)</i> <br><br>  To date, there are many methods for the synthesis of automatic control systems (ACS).  The authors of the article for the first time solve the problem of the synthesis of the ACS of a mobile robot using genetic algorithms (GA).  For the experiment, the task ‚ÄúSumo of robots‚Äù was chosen.  The paper presents the model of the ACS of a robot-sumoist and compares the effectiveness of various GAs. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/520/db0/9d4/520db09d424945f4bec480dc1acaf766.jpg" width="700"><br><br><h4>  2012 </h4><br><h6>  <a href="http://pribor.ifmo.ru/file/article/5914.pdf">Study of piezoelectric microrobot actuators</a> </h6><br>  <i>(P. Yu. Gedko, A. B. Smirnov, S. I. Pugachev, E. Yu. Rytov)</i> <br><br>  In robotics, miniature actuators are becoming increasingly important due to the economy of materials, as well as the reliability and accuracy of their operations.  The authors of the article considered the movement of a microrobot with a spherical hinge, which consists of a ball and a tubular actuator.  Having studied the characteristics of the manufacture of such actuators, the authors proved the effectiveness of the technology of ultrasonic shaping. <br><br><hr><br><br><h6>  <a href="http://journal.infokosmo.ru/file/article/14434.pdf">Unmanned aerial vehicles in the timber industry complex: the possibilities of new technologies</a> </h6><br>  <i>(S.P. Prisyazhnyuk)</i> <br><br>  One of the priorities in instrument making is the development of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).  In the field of forestry, UAVs that collect photo and video information can solve problems related to forest protection, fire prevention and search for the missing.  The article describes in detail what problems the introduction of the UAV into the work of the timber industry complex can solve and what are the main advantages of using these devices. <br><br><hr><br><br><h6>  <a href="http://pribor.ifmo.ru/file/article/5988.pdf">Optical-electronic device for automatic landing of an autonomous flying robot</a> </h6><br>  <i>(V. O. Ivanov)</i> <br><br>  A large number of aircraft accidents occur due to improper landing of the aircraft (LA).  Automation of the landing process is relevant and at the same time difficult to implement.  As a possible solution, it is proposed to use onboard cameras, which play the role of navigation sensors in small-sized autonomous UAVs.  The author presents the results of the experiment with the layout of the PTZ camera, as well as an assessment of the errors of the developed device. <br><br><hr><br><br><h6>  <a href="http://pribor.ifmo.ru/file/article/5998.pdf">Features of the development of the user interface of a mobile information robot</a> </h6><br>  <i>(M.V. Prischepa, K.Y. Baranov)</i> <br><br>  Many organizations are looking for new ways to automate the process of transmitting and receiving information.  Actual in this regard is the creation of a mobile robot capable of processing, voicing and displaying the data needed by the user.  This article presents the features of human perception, on the basis of which the development of an information robot is proposed.  It also shows how this robot can be used to provide services in a shopping center and other institutions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8a5/258/3a1/8a52583a117c401e8436c5f5df760d1c.jpg" width="700"><br><br><h4>  2013 </h4><br><h6>  <a href="http://pribor.ifmo.ru/file/article/6220.pdf">The motion control algorithm of the mobile wheeled robot in the task of tracking the exosystem</a> </h6><br>  <i>(G.I. Boltunov, A.V. Lyamin, A.I. Petrik)</i> <br><br>  An important task of robotics is tracking a moving object, the motion parameters of which are unknown.  The solution to this problem can be the construction of an observer system capable of assessing the state of an object.  The paper presents a mathematical model of a wheeled robot, on the basis of which control laws are built in a dynamically changing environment. <br><br><hr><br><br><h6>  <a href="http://pribor.ifmo.ru/file/article/6222.pdf">Analysis of the influence of wind disturbances on the stabilization system of the course of aircraft</a> </h6><br>  <i>(V. V. Grigoriev, A. B. Bushuev, A. N. Korovyakov, Yu. V. Litvinov)</i> <br><br>  The automatic control systems of an aircraft are subject to the influence of a large volume of random disturbances, the consideration of which requires cumbersome calculations.  To simplify the calculations, a scalar characteristic of the system is introduced in the work ‚Äî the volume of the likelihood ellipsoid.  Over time, the nature of the change of this value will determine the dynamic properties of the stabilization system of the aircraft. <br><br><hr><br><br><h6>  <a href="http://pribor.ifmo.ru/file/article/6210.pdf">Synthesis of quadcopter control system using a simplified mathematical model</a> </h6><br>  <i>(A. A. Pyrkin, T. A. Maltseva, D. V. Labadin, M. O. Surov, A. A. Bobtsov)</i> <br><br>  In the process of stabilizing the UAV, many difficulties arise, one of which is the complexity of the calculations.  The paper investigates the problem of the synthesis of the control algorithm for multi-rotor aircraft in order to stabilize it in space.  The authors propose to decompose a complex dynamic system into simpler independent components in order to simplify the analysis of a closed system. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f27/444/16c/f2744416c9a8459ab84ad4f17cd9d9a3.jpg" width="700"><br><br><h4>  2014 </h4><br><h6>  <a href="http://ntv.ifmo.ru/file/article/10708.pdf">Improving the Police Office Model for the Security of Swarm Robotic Systems</a> </h6><br>  <i>(I. A. Zikratov, A. V. Gurtov, T. V. Zikratova, E. V. Kozlova)</i> <br><br>  The Police Office Model is a model for ensuring information security by special structures that are called police stations.  As part of this work, a POM-based defense mechanism was developed that is able to detect and neutralize information attacks.  Also in the V-REP environment, a numerical experiment was conducted using an ant algorithm to protect a swarm of robots. <br><br><hr><br><br><h6>  <a href="http://ntv.ifmo.ru/file/article/9614.pdf">Building a model of trust and reputation for objects of multi-agent robotic systems with decentralized control</a> </h6><br>  <i>(I. A. Zikratov, T. V. Zikratova, I. S. Lebedev, A. V. Gurtov)</i> <br><br>  Multi-agent robotic systems have several drawbacks - decentralized control, unpredictability and remote location of agents - which make it vulnerable to attacks by saboters.  The paper discusses the methods of "soft" protection in order to identify and neutralize robots that reduce the effectiveness of the system.  The proposed model introduces the concepts of trust and reputation, which help to calculate robots, saboteurs. <br><br><hr><br><br><h6>  <a href="http://ntv.ifmo.ru/file/article/9414.pdf">Architecture of the remote control system of robotic objects</a> </h6><br>  <i>(C. V. Shavetov, A. A. Vedyakov, A. A. Pyrkin)</i> <br><br>  The growing number of cloud services today allows you to manage virtually any device that has Internet access.  The article describes the developed architecture that controlled the Lego Mindstorms TXT and Parallax Boe-Bot robots.  The authors of the article solved two tasks - data transfer between the object and the user and monitoring the position of the remote object.  As a result, a universal remote control architecture was developed that does not depend on the control object and works without long delays. <br><br><hr><br><br><h6>  <a href="http://ntv.ifmo.ru/file/article/9378.pdf">Adaptive control of a two-stage robotic arm based on the method of a serial compensator</a> </h6><br>  <i>(A. A. Margun, K. A. Zimenko, D. N. Bazylev, A. A. Bobtsov, A. S. Kremlev)</i> <br><br>  The question of how to control a robotic arm is quite important, since the quality of the entire control system largely depends on it.  Few of the management methods take into account such features of the system as the nonstationarity of its parameters and external disturbances.  The adaptive method described in the article is simple to implement, and the simulation results indicate its effectiveness. <br><br><hr><br><br><h6>  <a href="http://ntv.ifmo.ru/file/article/11190.pdf">The control system of an unmanned aerial vehicle equipped with a robotic manipulator</a> </h6><br>  <i>(A. A. Margun, K. A. Zimenko, D. N. Bazylev, A. A. Bobtsov, A. S. Kremlev, D. D. Ibraev, M. Chek)</i> <br><br>  Interest in UAVs capable of transferring building blocks or pulling cable has recently increased markedly, but the number of studies in the field of stabilization and control of these devices remains low.  In this paper, a method of controlling a combined robot consisting of a quadrocopter and a robotic arm attached to it is proposed.  In addition, it solved the problem of synthesizing the UAV control system, in which the reactive moment created by the manipulator is compensated. <br><br><hr><br><br><h6>  <a href="http://pribor.ifmo.ru/file/article/10259.pdf">The task of planning action information unmanned aerial vehicle</a> </h6><br>  <i>(L.M. Neugodnikova)</i> <br><br>  Among the many approaches to the management of UAV groups, the authors did not find one that would take into account the heterogeneity of the UAVs in the group, while UAVs in modern aviation systems can perform completely different tasks.  To improve the efficiency of such systems, it is proposed to take into account the peculiarities of managing its individual members.  The proposed article sets the task of controlling the flight path of a UAV that takes photographs of a specific area. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/478/036/341/478036341d424705b447eb7d6ad0388f.jpg" width="700"><br><br><h4>  2015 </h4><br><h6>  <a href="http://ntv.ifmo.ru/file/article/13476.pdf">Ways to stabilize two-legged robots in a standing position on a movable support</a> </h6><br>  <i>(D.N. Bazylev, A.A. Pyrkin, A.A. Margun, K.A. Zimenko, A.S. Kremlev, D.D. Ibrayev, M. ƒåech)</i> <br><br>  A large number of research and development is devoted to walking robots, and today many have heard about ASIMO and BigDog.  In contrast to previous works, the authors consider the problem of stabilizing a robot moving along a surface with varying angle of inclination and angular velocity.  The article describes two ways to solve the problem: in the first, the kinematic and dynamic models of the robot are built, in the second, only the kinematic ones.  The results indicate the effectiveness of each of these methods under certain conditions. <br><br><hr><br><br><h6>  <a href="http://pribor.ifmo.ru/file/article/13749.pdf">Flying robot control algorithms when tracking a moving object</a> </h6><br>  <i>(Buy Van Shaun, A. B. Bushuev, G. M. Shmigelsky, Yu. V. Litvinov, E. G. Shchaev)</i> <br><br>  One of the areas of application of the UAV is tracking objects.  Quadcopters are ideal for solving problems from this area due to their high maneuverability and low cost.  As part of this work, a number of algorithms were developed for analyzing images taken by the front camera, which is attached to the quadcopter.  Comparison of images taken at different points of flight, allows you to implement the method of stereoscopic vision, with which you can measure the distance from the UAV to the object. <br><br><hr><br><br><h6>  <a href="http://journal.infokosmo.ru/file/article/15400.pdf">Engineering and psychological analysis of augmented reality technologies for visual support of the robot‚Äôs remote control by a manipulator</a> </h6><br>  <i>(V.M. Usov, F.M. Kulakov, B.I. Kryuchkov, S.E. Chernakova, A.A. Karpov)</i> <br><br>  A lot of research conducted at the junction of the areas of robotics and astronautics.  Despite this, actual tasks, according to the authors, are the search for optimal control of an anthropomorphic robot at a distance and the organization of information support in the process of interaction with a remote robot.  The article proposes to conduct an engineering-psychological experiment in which the interaction of a human operator with a manipulator will be accompanied by the use of augmented reality technology and the method of ‚Äúlearning by showing motion‚Äù. <br><br><hr><br><br>
<h6>  <a href="http://pribor.ifmo.ru/file/article/11705.pdf">Mathematical description of the operation of a hydrodynamic stand with a pressure maintenance system containing an unloaded valve</a> </h6><br>  <i>(A.V. Krasilnikov)</i> <br><br>  Advances in the field of robotics also help to solve the problems of the development of the World Ocean.  To create launch systems that use underwater robots, and to carry out experiments using them, special equipment, called a hydrodynamic test bench (SDS), is required.  The problem is that when the robot is launched into the booth chamber, the pressure in it increases, and this often makes it difficult to accurately determine the characteristics of the trigger mechanism.  To stabilize the pressure in the GDS, the author of the article proposes to include an unloaded valve in it and gives a mathematical description of his development in this article. <br><br><hr><br><br><h6>  <a href="http://journal.infokosmo.ru/file/article/14667.pdf">The prototype of the landing algorithm of an unmanned aerial vehicle in complex terrain</a> </h6><br>  <i>(Lei Zhao, A.S. Konev, A.G. Karmanov)</i> <br><br>  One of the tasks that the UAV is intended to solve in general and multikopter in particular is the analysis and survey of a mountainous area into which a person cannot get.  As part of this article, a prototype algorithm was developed that analyzes the terrain and selects the optimum trajectory of the UAV landing in an emergency.  This algorithm was recorded on board the multicopter and tested in mountainous terrain. <br><br><hr><br><br><h6>  <a href="http://pribor.ifmo.ru/file/article/13990.pdf">Robust dynamic positioning system for a robotic layout of a surface vessel</a> </h6><br>  <i>(S. M. Vlasov, O. I. Borisov, V. S. Gromov, A. A. Pyrkin, A. A. Bobtsov)</i> <br><br>  In order to save money and reduce the risk of damage to a physical vessel, the authors of the article propose to conduct experiments on a special robotic installation equipped with a technical vision system.  At one of these installations, they tested the dynamic positioning system.  In addition to the results of this experiment, the article also provides a mathematical description of the movement of a robotic layout. <br><br><hr><br><br><h6>  <a href="http://ntv.ifmo.ru/file/article/14090.pdf">Control of quadcopter with wind disturbance compensation</a> </h6><br>  <i>(I. V. Petranevsky, O. I. Borisov, V. S. Gromov, A. A. Pyrkin)</i> <br><br>  The article describes the decomposition of the mathematical model of the UAV, as well as the synthesis of the regulator to control this model.  Due to the method of the serial compensator, the wind disturbances, which in this work are taken as unknown constants, can be neglected. <br><br><hr><br><br>  <i>PS If our digest was useful for you, subscribe to <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/spbifmo/blog/">our blog on Habr√©</a> .</i>  <i>This is the best way to support us in our work on filling it with interesting materials, friends :)</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/302208/">https://habr.com/ru/post/302208/</a></p>
