  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Top 10 games for iPhone / iPad (2011)</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> Shortly before the New Year, we made our own top best games for iOS.  In this case, we were guided by three criteria: the fun of the gameplay, the beauty of graphic performance, and the quality of adaptation to the ‚Äúapple‚Äù platform or, if in Russian, ease of management and the absence of glitches.  Of course, it didn‚Äôt do without subjectivity, but we tried to keep it to a minimum.  By the way, every game presented in our top throughout the year either occupied the leading place in the American top, or entered into one of the iTunes charts. <br><br>  <b>10) Draw Race 2</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b89/249/cb4/b89249cb49e1bac848dcf089131d0336.jpg" alt="image">

      This game is loved even by those who can not stand the race, and the machines with disdain.  It's all about the unusual approach to the usual and, as it seemed, not able to surprise the genre of arcade pokatushek.  The game, instead of forcing the user to steer his four-wheeled monster along a winding road, suggests drawing a route that the car will rush after starting.  What will happen next - almost does not depend on the player.  After all cars take off, he can only passively watch what is happening and cheer on his typewriter (well, press the ‚Äúacceleration‚Äù button at a critical moment). <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>9) Tiny Wings</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d66/f80/408/d66f804085e673fe521e39d98ce5b3f8.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  This game has conquered many even more simple than the Angry Birds, the gameplay, the original exploitation of the bird theme and light psychedelic.  It is difficult to call the hypnotic process Tiny Wings otherwise.  Throughout the game, the little sparrows with bulging eyes jump from one striped slope to another, managing to collect coins with a rounded belly.  All this under the sweet electronics and pigeon clucking. <br><br>  <b>8) Superbrothers: Sword &amp; Sworcery EP</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/222/2f2/bd4/2222f2bd4987e50f741a32e95e6f5baf.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The most art-house project on mobile platforms.  Pixel adventure of an incomprehensible girl in a mystical forest, in which there was a place for battles with demons, visiting ancient temples, rescuing locals, witchcraft books, magic spells, contemplative philosophy and, most importantly, a wonderful storyline.  A very rare and very valuable combination not only for a project under iOS, but also generally for a good game. <br><br>  <b>7) Ticket to Ride</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/832/35a/322/83235a3226121ccede134b699ac21b87.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  One of the most successful and, perhaps, successful ports of board games, despite the terrible country music and all the same as in the original, the map of the United States.  Plus, a very important multiplayer feature: the ability to play with the four on one mobile device (and, by the way, the system itself keeps records, so no longer need to recalculate points for each turn for the tenth time).  The latter plays a very important role.  From desktop hardcore Ticket to Ride turns into a cute tablet casual. <br><br>  <b>6) Gesundheit</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/98b/694/427/98b6944278228998713141db8a43b014.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  A game about a pig flu patient who fights horrible monsters, throwing snot.  Certain sharpness in the gameplay adds an important point - he throws his gnaws not at opponents.  It is useless to throw at them, they eat these snot with pleasure.  So the piglet has to be tagged into traps, and more specifically into fish that pretend to be traps that eat monsters.  In general, if it were not for the graphics in the style of children's notebooks painted with crayons, then the art director of Gesundheit could easily come with people in white coats. <br><br>  <b>5) Jelly Defense</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f0e/ed7/8a2/f0eed78a275b515f8bda0acf73948181.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The usual tower defense, painted under the acid after viewing the paintings of Salvador Dali.  At least, this feeling is created when meeting the Polish project: mushrooms, smooth curves in the style of soft watches, white checkered backgrounds, tentacle-shaped laughing monsters, bellowed baleen centipede towers and Slavic electronics with a central accordion part.  The output is a meditative project, from which it is doubly difficult to break away: on the one hand, proven mechanics, on the other, an abnormal art design in a good way. <br><br>  <b>UPD:</b> <i>By the way, we communicated with the developers of this wonderful game not so long ago - the interview will be interesting to those who make games for iOS themselves, and are interested in promotion.</i>  <i>Plus there are a couple of cool pictures of the creation process.</i>  <i>You can read and see <a href="http://app2top.ru/%3Fp%3D1874">here</a> .</i> <br><br>  <b>4) Infinity Blade II</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/071/855/e31/071855e315864353242a166dd83ef7f0.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Epic Games role-playing action, a kind of milestone in mobile gaming and just a good story about a knight without a princess.  If the first part in 2010 was perceived as a demonstration of the capabilities of Apple devices and at the same time the talent of Epic programmers who stuck the Unreal Engine into a mobile phone, the second part turned out to be a real triple-A project without platform discounts.  The big world, the sea of ‚Äã‚Äãcontent, addictive gameplay and strong plot by the authorship of fantasy master Brandon Sanders. <br><br>  <b>3) Bumpy Road</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e07/217/2bb/e072172bbe6611ed6380609c7c3834b5.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  A love story in retro style, whose gameplay in many ways resembles a game on a xylophone.  More precisely, childish fuss with this musical instrument, when the child aggressively carries the stick on the boards from ‚Äúto‚Äù to ‚Äúsi‚Äù and back.  In the case of Bumpy Road, the player performs a ‚Äúfuss‚Äù so that a cute couple on a miniature typewriter collects coins to the romantic music a la ‚ÄúFrance‚Äù. <br><br>  <b>2) Contre Jour</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d70/477/45d/d7047745d87428a33eb0840afd1a31c4.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Lyrical Ukrainian psychedelic with inodekt-control, which the project elusively resembles Bumpy Road.  One of the saddest and most atmospheric games of the past year, which, in fact, touched many.  The only thing that confuses is the protagonist, who looks like a big black sperm cell, hunting for strange luminous blue balls.  However, probably, in this vagueness the charm is hidden, inaccessible to a drop from Gish, not to the mysterious boy from Limbo, nor, all the more, to the dead cat from Naught. <br><br>  <b>1) Where Is My Water?</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2ca/14e/a09/2ca14ea09e41a2363d8db522b5123331.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Crocodile Swoopy won the women's hearts of our editorial staff and, judging by the leading positions in the Christmas Top Grossing on the App Store, not only them.  A plump, greenish monster, in the degree of affection, is not inferior to the frog from Cut the Rope, and besides, it is prone to cleanliness - the main star of the year.  As for the game itself, there were no surprises here: the realistic physical model of the game water forces more than once and not two replays of seemingly unpretentious levels.  So most of the time, poor Swamp has to sit in an empty bath. <br><br>  According to the materials of the portal <a href="http://app2top.ru/">App2Top.ru</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/136038/">https://habr.com/ru/post/136038/</a></p>
