  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Interesting economy - taxis are cheaper every day than your car</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I looked at the reasoning in the next topic about <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/popular_science/83272/">food in restaurants</a> and decided to lay out my calculations on the automotive theme. <br>  The thesis is: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs more profitable to take a taxi every day than to buy your car.‚Äù <br>  The fact is that not so long ago I really wanted to buy a new car, but sat down at the numbers and considered what was happening. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  We consider the money spent on the car. </h3><br><h4>  One-time cost per car </h4><br>  New car - about <strong>650,000 rubles at a time</strong> . <br>  Alarm installation - <strong>from 10 000 rubles</strong> . <br>  Buying winter tires - from 10 000 rubles. <br>  Total immediately takes about <strong>670,000 rubles</strong> <br><h4>  Annual expenses </h4><br>  1. <a href="http://www.r-choice.ru/kasko_mitsubishi.htm">Casco - about <strong>50,000 rubles a year</strong></a> .  Someone may say that you need to save on insurance, but personally my nerves are more expensive.  The icicle that has fallen recently on the neighbor‚Äôs car only confirms this, a couple of hijackings, by the way. <br><br>  2. The cost of <a href="">maintenance</a> in the first three years is about <strong>14,000 rubles per year</strong> .  A very controversial point from my point of view.  In fact, the amount is very dependent on how lucky the car is and how carefully it is handled and which gasoline to drive.  For example, repairing an engine with FSI, which is choked with our gasoline, can result in 60,000 rubles and more.  For the calculation, I took the "ideal" option when everything is fine and almost nothing breaks :) <br><br>  3. The cost of gasoline.  Every day I need to drive about 40 kilometers.  Consumption in urban mode 9-10 liters per 100 kilometers, that is, 4 liters per 40 km or 80 rubles per day.  In 2009, it was 250 business days.  It turns out that I would have spent about <strong>20,000 rubles a year</strong> on gasoline.

      4. <a href="http://www.strahovka-shop.ru/auto_nalog.asp">Transport tax</a> - about 2000 rubles per year.  These are trivialities compared to previous amounts :) This may include the fines received, but we assume that I will drive carefully and no one will expose me. <br><br>  5. Parking for cars.  40 rubles per night and it turns out that you need to pay about <strong>14,000 rubles per year</strong> for parking <br><br>  Total per year takes about <strong>100 000 rubles per year for maintenance.</strong> <br><h4>  Lower car cost </h4><br>  On average, a normal lancer age of 3 years (ie, 2007) could be taken for 430-470,000 rubles. <br>  It turns out that in three years the car loses 25-30% of its value.  It turns out, then within 3 years I would have lost at least 200,000 rubles in reducing the cost of the car. <br><h4>  Total for 3 years </h4><br>  Only 970,000 rubles were spent. <br>  Residue (in the form of the market value of the car): 450,000 rubles. <br>  Losses: 520 000 rubles. <br><h3>  Consider the cost of a taxi </h3><br>  400 rubles a day will cost a taxi at the most unfair rates (given for Ulyanovsk).  That is, without taking into account that I can agree with the driver to work with me on a permanent basis for much less money (about 250 rubles). <br>  Total for a taxi a year I would spend <strong>from 62,500 rubles to 100,000 rubles.</strong> <br>  That is, losses for three years would be a maximum of 300,000 rubles. <br><h3>  findings </h3><br>  As for the calculation, I took an optimistic picture for car maintenance and a pessimistic picture for a taxi, it can be assumed that the real numbers will testify even more against buying a car.  It turned out that in Russia your car is more of a luxury, and the means of transportation is a taxi. <br><br>  PS For Moscow, the situation may be different, somewhere I saw prices for a taxi of 22 rubles per kilometer, in this case it will be more expensive than its own car. <br><br>  <strong>UPD1</strong> : The comments mentioned that money for a car can be put into the bank at interest.  +1 reason for the economy of using a taxi. <br>  <strong>UPD2: I never urge to give up my car and the freedom</strong> it gives.  Calculation is a reason for reflection on the topic ‚Äúare you ready to spend so much.‚Äù  Most people saw in the topic a call - ‚ÄúCheap !!!  Grab Faster, SO NEEDED !!! 1, which is wrong.  Money should not be the deciding factor in all decisions. <br>  <strong>UPD3:</strong> Comfort is important to me, so I personally settled on a used foreign car.  It is expensive.  But much more economical than a new car. <br><br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/83327/">https://habr.com/ru/post/83327/</a></p>
