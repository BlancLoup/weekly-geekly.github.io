  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Netherlands intelligence had access to PRISM data and implemented agents in IT companies</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  This morning, the General Intelligence and Security Officer of the Netherlands Ministry of the Interior (Algemene Inlichtingen en Veiligheidsdienst), who works with the Islamic extremist watch, <a href="http://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2013/06/11/aivd-heeft-ook-toegang-tot-informatie-uit-prism/">confirmed</a> that they also receive information on the PRISM program in exchange for cooperation with the NSA. <br><br>  The newspaper De Telegraaf describes the cooperation between intelligence organizations literally as follows: the services of the Netherlands mark the American email address as suspicious, and within five minutes already receive all available information on it. <br><br>  The agent confirmed that many companies are actively providing access to their own data through specially developed applications: Skype, Google and Facebook give everything away.  According to his statement, the first of the list for years refused to provide funds for wiretapping, but after the acquisition by Microsoft, everything changed.  (It is worth recalling the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/122928/">patent application of Microsoft</a> for listening to Internet telephony, published one and a half years before the acquisition, as well as the price that was given for Skype, it was immediately twice as high as Google had offered.)

      Much more interesting is the statement that not only American Internet giants cooperate, but also Dutch IT companies that voluntarily provide information on a ‚Äúblue-plate‚Äù.  If management does not want to meet, intelligence services have a hidden agent within the company, ready to serve any information request. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  With the new information from the Netherlands it is difficult to imagine the limits of access for any of the NSA employees, because, as Edward Snowden claims in a previously published interview, he had the opportunity to access personal data of any American from his workplace. <br><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúI, sitting at my desk, of course, had the authority to listen to anyone, from you and your accountant to the federal judge and even the President, if I had their personal mail.‚Äù </blockquote><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/5yB3n9fu-rM%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700019,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjC6f5C9Dvm-4hc3WG0UJzAjPxKXQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Obviously, here he mentions "listening" not as a record of telephone conversations, but as reading an e-mail, accessible to him in case of knowing her address.  Later in an interview, he explains why he took such a desperate step and why he had nothing to lose: <br><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúBecause even if you do not do anything wrong, you are being watched and recorded.  And the storage capacity of these systems is gradually increasing year by year by orders of magnitude.  Soon we will come to the point where you don‚Äôt have to do something wrong, you will one day be suspicious because of someone, simply because of the wrong phone call.  And then they can use the system to carefully investigate all your actions and decisions in the past.  Every acquaintance with whom you have ever discussed something.  And blame you on the basis of this, put an innocent person under suspicion, and call everyone in the context of a violator. ‚Äù </blockquote><br><br>  At the moment, the exact location of Edward is <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/182942/">unknown</a> .  A group of Americans <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/182922/">filed a lawsuit</a> against the US National Security Agency, Obama, the Department of Justice and Verizon with a damage of $ 3 billion. <br><br>  Has anyone ever won because of the current situation?  Unnoticed by us on June 8 of this year, the novel ‚Äú1984‚Äù by George Orwell turned 64 years old.  The effect of declassified data on mass espionage for every American is unclear, but book sales on Amazon <a href="http://washingtonexaminer.com/sales-of-orwells-1984-up-69-percent-on-amazon-list/article/2531503">jumped</a> by 69% and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/movers-and-shakers/books/ref%3Dzg_bsms_nav_mov_1_mov">continue to grow</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/182988/">https://habr.com/ru/post/182988/</a></p>
