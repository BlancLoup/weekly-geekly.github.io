  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Automation of production. Getting ready to write ASUP</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I decided to share the experience accumulated over 8 years in the development, implementation and maintenance of automated systems at the enterprise level.  We will not talk about controllers and process control systems or ERP with accounting files, but I will tell you about how we do that between them, where there are no sensors, but there is still no money, but there are blanks, semi-finished products, products, machines, technologists, planners and reports. <br>  Who is interested in this topic welcome ... <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  We presume that you are in a certain managerial position on a project for the development of automated control systems.  Thus, what is an automated control system and with which you eat it, I hope you already know.  Let's talk about what to pay attention to and how to cook this dish. <br><br><h5>  Not </h5><br>  There are no identical plants.  Each plant is unique.  Even if Plant A produces products similar to Plant B, but it is 10,000 kilometers from the first, the system will be different, because both the other suppliers and the ERPs joined to the ERP were made by others, and other people, although they may speak the same language.  From this conclusion - there is no universal system.  No, as there is no Santa Claus, and do not try.  Many copies are already broken before you, do not add your sawdust.  Yes, you are strong and smart, you realize your plans.  You will receive a universal system that can be deployed in a year - one and a half settings in some factories with labor costs from 2 to 10 crutches per day.  But at the same time, you are likely to lose at least the performance and usability of your system.  The data will lie exactly in this table and precisely so, because it is necessary, and not so optimal.  Forms will look like an endless set of text boxes and buttons, because they are generated automatically.  And you will be surrounded by members of your team who, by this time, will even communicate with each other in the smoking room only in the scripting language in which the system is configured.

    <h5>  what </h5><br>  So, the merchants signed the long-awaited contract.  While analysts are sharpening pencils and charging voice recorders, it's time to look around and figure out where you were abandoned.  What can wait at the end of the tunnel: <br>  1. <i>Absolutely new production</i> on which the paint is still not completely dry, or even the foundation is not yet there.  On the one hand, this is good, the staff will enter a new life already with your system, but it will also be in the process of learning.  So that: <br>  1.1.  As clearly as possible we enter the current representation of the Customer in the TOR <br>  1.2.  We cut the process into very short stages, after each stage we monitor that all relevant papers on the adoption of the module / function / subsystem are signed. <br>  1.3.  Morally and technically we are preparing for the fact that the power will change quite often.  The system will be cluttered with new requirements and joints by leaps and bounds.  In general, the requirements will change in the implementation process in any case, but in new plants this is most pronounced and drastically. <br><br>  2. <i>Old-time production without automated systems of</i> your level.  Something opposite to the above.  All forms of reports have already been approved and verified, all the journals are spliced ‚Äã‚Äãand strung together, everything goes on in its regular course.  And here, you stick to it!  With its own system and boxes with computers that occupy a place on the tables, where flowers used to stand so cute and take a snack.  It is unlikely that you will be welcomed cordially because: <br>  2.1.  Sit on the back of analysts.  Once the processes are set, then they should be described as clearly as possible.  Require copies of all documents, papers and papers.  Most likely, a good solution would be to translate all these magazines into electronic form.  You should not do everything differently, in the right way, because the process has already been set, and your task is to improve, and not to turn it upside down. <br>  2.2.  Recruit sensible implementation team.  Very much will depend on them.  In this case it is not enough to realize, it is still necessary to competently convey to the user the benefits and benefits of this terrible box on the table.  You should not rely on the management of the plant, they say they will say - they will work in the system and why persuade them.  The key element of such systems is the end user.  In most cases, it is a source of primary data, and it is on these data that your process of implementation and conversion to PEF / PE depends. <br><br>  3. <i>Old-time production with self-copied / purchased / stolen systems</i> .  Most often such systems more than one.  There are cases when the same indicators are entered simultaneously in several systems.  And here you are with the next system, ready to add another shortcut to the desktop and say that this, this and this should be entered here. <br>  3.1.  If the goal of your system is to replace all that is - congratulations, you have a plus sign.  Just do not forget to hang it in the most visible place and blow it to everyone and everywhere.  Again, you need a positive attitude of the end user throughout the development and implementation of the system.  Get to be greeted with a smile and a cup of coffee, and not a mutter of "again these cornered." <br>  3.2.  Pay your attention and the attention of analysts to the functionality of old systems and their user interfaces.  Perhaps you will learn something new for yourself, especially from self-written systems. <br><br><h5>  Who </h5><br>  We have approximately decided what to do, we are waiting for the technical specifications and specifications, and we are thinking about who will do all this.  I will not dwell now on the topic of team development and teambuilding, it‚Äôs written a lot and well.  But I want to draw your attention to the specifics of such systems. <br>  People need to imagine what they are doing and what they are automating.  It‚Äôs difficult, believe me, to explain to the girl by the designer of the interface of mobile devices on the fingers why the operator of the open-hearth furnace will not be able to ‚Äúfinger‚Äù into a small ‚Äúbutton‚Äù on the screen if she does it without problems.  Conclusion - hold meetings, tell, show photos - video.  Key people - on a business trip, and without options.  The best option is for everyone, including the leaders of the testing and documentation groups.  The chef presses the money and requires substantiation - no wonder, get out, invent small occasions, send one person, but each one is new.  As practice shows, the experience of teaching users their own development and programmers is no less useful.  And most importantly, remember that there are no identical factories, and if Peter was there, then he has nothing to do.  There is something, and very much so. <br><br>  And so there is Who is.  In the next article, ‚ÄúWriting ASCS,‚Äù I will tell you the nuances about Chem (DB, languages) and How (architecture, modules are required and not very).  If there is a demand, it is possible to take out a separate topic also ‚ÄúImplementing the CAMS‚Äù. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/128694/">https://habr.com/ru/post/128694/</a></p>
