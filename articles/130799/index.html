  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Acer A100 - 7 inches, but how much help!</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Every gadget man, if he doesn‚Äôt, then surely thought about such a thing as a tablet.  About two years ago, the tablet was called the big digitizer - which designers drew with a pen. <br>  But in 2010, Apple introduced the Apple iPad to the world.  And it started: half of the world said ‚ÄúI want‚Äù, and the second half began telling me about the size of the device and its applicability: they say it will soon be a rug, floor covering and so on.  But the reality turned out to be different: wild demand, huge popularity and real help in daily tasks. <br>  Throughout 2010, manufacturers of other brands pored over the counterstroke and built dissimilar plates.  Most of all, of course, the Chinese brothers succeeded with their cheap handicrafts.  Terrible quality, a couple of hours of battery life - all this did not inspire among geeks. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  But the device that replaces the e-book, player, PDA, Internet viewer, the simplest netbook and game console - this is a coveted device!  By the way, with the advent of tablets in such quantity and quality, netbooks began to die as a class. <br>  Koreans, namely Samsung, did not suffer for a long time and released their answer: 7 inch Samsung P1000, which is still in demand.  But he has an important disadvantage: the operating system and the ideology in it from the phone.  Google quickly came up with its mega-popular Android OS and released Android Honeycomb (3.0), and also helped Motorola to launch its Xoom - a very controversial, but meanwhile successful tablet. <br>  Other companies, one after another, began to announce clones of something very similar to the Motorola Xoom and Apple iPad. <br>  Among the monotonous design clones, Lenovo managed to stand out (by the way, it did not release its product for sale), as well as Acer, with its brainchild Iconia.  At low cost, the Iconia Tab A500 had a 10 inch multi-touch display, metal case, MVA display, usb host, and a good battery (8 hours of watching videos online). <br>  But for permanent work, 10 inches, in my opinion, is too big.  Samsung p1000 bribed people with the fact that it can be "put in your pocket."  7 inches is a separate form factor.  Already not a phone, but also not a tablet. <br>  In this review, I want to introduce you to the 7 inch brother Acer A500 - <strong>Acer Iconia Tab A100.</strong> <br><h1>  Acer Iconia Tab A100 </h1><br>  The device comes in a white box, slightly larger than the tablet itself.  Is that the height of the box above 15 times. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/91837ef8/2a0ddc23/781db575/24ccf4a7.jpg"><br><br>  Inside the box we find: paper, micro usb cable, mains charger.  By the way, the tablet is charged only from the outlet and proprietary memory.  So I recommend not to lose charge.  Find a new so far problematic. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/4b2c45e8/3de81258/4bea2af9/eb8ea0ef.jpg"><br><br>  The entire front panel is covered with glass (unlike the older brother, the a100 is just tempered glass).  Not scratched, but paws hard. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/d0a72d4f/281a5060/6fd2b7a3/8b08bf2a.jpg">

      The back wall is made of plastic.  This is a plus in terms of weight - the tablet is much lightened.  It can easily be held with one hand and work.  The hand does not get tired.  But blurs and scratches. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/59c0282f/b08a2247/0fd3dc89/917a2a18.jpg"><br><br>  From the connectors on the faces there are: micro-HDMI (you need a separate adapter for $ 2), a special dock-connector, a micro-usb slave (yes, even with an adapter, you can‚Äôt connect the USB flash drive), 3.5 headphone jack, microSD card slot, connector branded storage device. <br>  There is also a volume rocker, a screen rotation lock lever, a power button with indication, two speakers covered with a grid, and a reset button. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/5fa2b9bb/fea043a9/51e9715d/7d7cd279.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/0010145c/f6a03c08/e3fb69e8/84c89f70.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/230fe14b/5c841816/80ac6bc2/65a7ea38.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/0eade095/6d36fe61/01bba8df/32c41e86.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/1e2cdea1/c2c0ac77/91b0c102/3df4a197.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/39e8278b/970cab5a/ed7419e0/9add0df9.jpg"><br><br>  On the front panel, as it is not surprising, there is one touch button ‚Äúhome‚Äù (why is not quite clear), but an event indicator is inscribed in it - it flickers in blue and white, as well as a 2 megapixel camera for video chats. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/7550e390/8fa047ee/3432a917/aad6428f.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/dcc3b935/57829507/fa76351b/aaf03d03.jpg"><br><br>  The back panel is equipped with a 5 megapixel camera and LED flash. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/ab2a918b/ea2d7bf9/6fdb93da/1d364b28.jpg"><br><br>  The screen in the TFT TN tablet is 1024 * 600 pixels, capacitive, supports 4 simultaneous clicks (the older brother has 10 clicks). <br>  Viewing angles are not bad, but there is a "dead zone" somewhere in the 15-20 degrees when tilting the tablet away from you - just in the working plane.  The screen dims.  Very unpleasant.  It is necessary either to turn the tablet, or change the angle of work. <br>  The brightness of the screen is good.  The resolution allows you to surf the Internet and read magazines (although due to the size of the screen it is necessary to resort to scaling). <br>  From left to right: Acer A500 (MVA), Acer A100 (TN), Samsung Galaxy SII (Super AMOLED Plus): <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/537a72ea/e52e7da8/b5c1041b/e998687f.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/06c3670c/8e965ea5/968a5644/3dafe901.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/db71d7e9/6042ee86/2a2c5239/b8fceed1.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/e44bcb68/6f3ae449/b84319c7/6f03f35d.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/3377be7c/202b1b8a/61544386/36cc88f8.jpg"><br><br>  Multitouch: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/f3529682/c4c1739a/2de7d9bc/64a02be6.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/b4bbb980/cd820f77/f70df43f/c0f7dd87.jpg"><br><br><br>  Android Honeycomb 3.2 is installed on the tablet.  Especially add-ons from Acer are not loaded, but there is a handy thing Planner - a list of current things is displayed: weather, date, unread letters, tasks, agenda. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/e5d00119/3a27be31/b34060fe/bbd542a4.jpg"><br><br>  The performance of the tablet at the level of: using the platform Nvidia Tegra 2 (dual-core processor for 1 GHz, graphics chip), 1 GB of RAM, 8 GB of internal memory.  In everyday life, 1080p when encoding with the H264 codec comes without brakes.  Other codecs, when played by any player - brakes even at 720p.  Games, including cool Tegra Zone - no brakes at all.  Trimmed multitouch does not interfere. <br>  According to the manufacturer, the tablet can work for 5 hours on battery.  In practice, it turns out one working day (in the morning he took off the charge, came home - put on charge) of active use (wi-fi is constantly on, mail, video calls, web browsing, watching videos at dinner are used). <br>  Cameras in the tablet from the category of "is."  That is, there is autofocus in the rear camera, but due to the amount of noise there is no desire to photograph something.  Even with good lighting, it makes a terrible noise.  Front camera - do not feel ashamed to call via Skype. <br>  Speaking of pockets: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/83bbdb24/d8e3dee0/40682ed2/5e6916d8.jpg"><br><br>  Summarizing, I can say that this tablet is even closer to the idyll, but there are also disadvantages. <br>  + Good screen resolution <br>  + Android 3.2 operating system <br>  + Compact size <br>  + Productive iron <br>  + Normal battery <br>  + Price - from 12,000 rubles ($ 380) <br>  - Not very good viewing angles <br>  - Special charger connector (charging only from the outlet) <br>  - Absence of usb-host <br>  - Trimmed multitouch <br>  - Bad camera (both front and rear). <br>  For me, the Acer A100 has become a good helper in work and entertainment, having spent a week with it, I am very used to it.  And the elder brother got to his wife - it is more convenient to read books from him, play Angry Birds and you can connect flash drives to it. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/e45b332a/b92d3ed9/bb72762b/c2e2f7f2.jpg"><br><br>  <a href="http://www.dropbox.com/gallery/4556105/1/a100%3Fh%3D963bfd">Photo Gallery</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/130799/">https://habr.com/ru/post/130799/</a></p>
