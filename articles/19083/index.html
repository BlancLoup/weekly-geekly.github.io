  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Take your own</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  One day, Buddha and his disciples passed by the village in which the opponents of Buddhists lived.  Villagers jumped out of their homes, surrounded the Buddha and the disciples, and began to insult them.  The disciples, too, began to burn and were ready to fight back, but the presence of the Buddha acted soothingly.  But the words of the Buddha confused both the villagers and the disciples. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  He turned to the disciples and said: <br>  - You disappointed me.  These people do their job.  They are angry.  It seems to them that I am the enemy of their religion, their moral values.  These people insult me, and this is natural.  But why are you angry?  Why did you let these people manipulate you?  You are now dependent on them.  Are you not free? <br>  Villagers did not expect such a reaction.  They were puzzled and silent.  In the silence that followed, the Buddha turned to them: <br>  - You said everything?  If you did not say everything, you will still have the opportunity to tell me everything you think when we return. <br>  The people from the village were completely puzzled, they asked: <br>  ‚ÄúBut we insulted you, why aren't you angry at us?‚Äù <br>  ‚ÄúYou are free people, and what you have done is your right.‚Äù  I do not react to it. <br>  I am also a free man.  Nothing can make me react, and no one can influence me and manipulate me.  I am the master of my manifestations.  My actions flow from my inner state.  And now I would like to ask you a question that concerns you.  The villagers next to yours welcomed me; they brought with them flowers, fruits and sweets.  I told them: ‚ÄúThank you, but we already had breakfast.  Take this fruit with my blessing to yourself.  We cannot carry them with us, we do not carry food with us. ‚Äù  Now I ask you: ‚ÄúWhat should they do with what I did not accept and bring them back?‚Äù <br>  One person from the crowd said: <br>  ‚ÄúThey probably took it home, and at home they distributed fruit and sweets to their children, their families.‚Äù <br>  Buddha smiled: <br>  - What will you do with your insults and curses?  I do not accept them.  If I refuse those fruits and sweets, they should take them back.  What can you do?  I reject your insults, so you take your load home and do whatever you want with it. </div>
