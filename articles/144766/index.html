  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Career growth in IT through a careerist</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <b>Introduction</b> <br><br>  The target audience is young professionals who are just starting their way in the field of IT.  I would like to help people get around the mistakes that he made himself in the process of career growth.  And also to receive constructive criticism from other habr-users. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://careers.veeam.com/images/developer.png" alt="image"></div><br>  * picture taken from <a href="http://careers.veeam.com/">this site</a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>A quick way to the top of Olympus</b> <br><br>  It so happened that each company has its own rules for improving employees.  I am sure that your place of work is not an exception, and beyond this framework they will not give a jump.  And, as a rule, any framework does not take into account the fact that the level of value of a young specialist grows exponentially (especially if he read my article <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/144554/">about training</a> ). <br>  A young junior gets into an organization without any specialty, very often he is thrown ‚Äúinto the pool with his head‚Äù - this is how he learns to swim.  After only one year, he is able to perfectly respond not only to general questions about programming, but also feels great in matters of specialty (WinForms, Andoird, Qt, etc ...).  During the year, many specialists reach the level when they can claim a large salary (sometimes even twice as large (!)).  But bureaucracy is bureaucracy, - such a specialist will have to spend 2-3 years to double it in the current place.  And at the same time, it is likely that specialist training after the first year will not be so active (which stalls its development). <br>  A specialist with a year of experience already has a zero chance of positively passing an interview for a middle position.  But in 9 out of 10 cases, he will not do this (he will not even try).  And not because it does not want a new job, but for other reasons that we will try to consider: 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
    <ul><li>  Not self-reliance.  Any specialist, after he begins to get more closely acquainted with any sphere, begins to realize how little he knows and how much he has yet to learn.  And there is a feeling that he is not yet a full-fledged middle in his field.  Of course, this is true, but ... it can certainly be the middle! </li><li>  Ignorance of the fact that there is a better life (higher salary and better working conditions).  In many organizations, there is an opaque accrual system for the salary, and for a beginner junior it will seem that his level of social remuneration is sufficient.  Most often this is not the case and, as was said earlier, in many cases a specialist who has worked for a year or more has already reached a level when he is able to receive two more!  It so happened that in organizations where they would take a junior without work experience, he would be offered almost two times less than where they would take the middle with a year or more. </li></ul><br><br>  From all the above, it becomes clear why in the world of large IT companies the turnover rate is very high.  In other words, the restrictions that the company sets most often sets the framework under which career growth is possible only by switching to a new job. <br>  The second reason, from those described above, can be overcome only by pure reason and the Internet, but how to increase your confidence and get a new job, I‚Äôll tell you further: <br><br>  <b>How to get your dream job</b> <br><br>  Jumping from place to place every one and a half / two years will lead to a high growth of skills (and not only in programming), and also significantly improve the financial situation.  As a result, it will be possible to have an interview for the desired vacancy in the desired company (Google, Microsoft, Yandex, etc ...). <br><br>  <i>Set goals too high</i> <br><br>  Always try to rank with requirements slightly higher than those you satisfy.  Having received such a place, a specialist, like a joon on his first workplace, begins to actively study and grows above himself.  With a healthy head, the result will be rapid professional growth. <br><br>  <i>Go to the interview!</i> <br><br>  Constantly talk for such vacancies, respond to suggestions.  Even if you have not been interviewed, the campaign or HR will not give up on you, and after a while they will talk again if there is a desire to try again.  In the end, the typical tasks at such events will become clear and the level of readiness will increase.  Very often, an interview is a probabilistic process, even with a good specialist, and for this reason it‚Äôs rather stupid to give at the mercy of fate what you can prepare for.  Also, attending such events, it becomes clear its weaknesses and where it is worth digging. <br>  Attending interviews, the process of finding a good job goes from the state of ‚Äúyou are looking for‚Äù to the state of ‚Äúyou are looking for‚Äù, as a person who constantly responds to job offers allows himself to be found. <br><br>  <i>How to get a pool of offers?</i> <br><br>  The easiest way is to actively announce your intentions.  From experience, I can say that it‚Äôs enough to register with several networks of business contacts ( <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/">LinkedIn</a> , <a href="http://moikrug.ru/">MyKrug</a> ) and join several clubs of these networks. <br>  For example, these are: <br><ul><li>  <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/groups/Algorithms-O-1920463">Algorithms (O)</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/groups/Vacancy-from-Recruiting-Company-WORLD-4051219">Vacancy from Recruiting Company WORLD STAFF ¬Æ</a> </li></ul><br><br>  In addition to this, it is worthwhile to get a professional blog or website where you can put your thoughts, material or something related to your work in order to position yourself not as an employee of company A, but as a professional programmer in field B. <br>  Participate in OpenSource projects and try, at least a little, to promote them.  A couple of projects on GitHub - this is the best your resume (for example, to help in the development: <a href="http://kbookocr.blogspot.com/">KBookOCR</a> ). <br>  Read a few articles on <a href="http://planetahr.ru/publication/1826">how to make a resume</a> and make it available on the first click. <br><br>  <b>What's next</b> <br><br>  Years have passed and you already have experience in two to five companies.  You have reached a level that objectively approached the conditional maximum.  But in fact - this is only the beginning of the most interesting!  For now, at least several ways are open ahead: <br>  - having studied the technology, you have studied the toolkit - now it's time to learn what can be implemented with this tool.  It‚Äôs the most to remember about the scientific work and your PhD, or on the foundation of your own company (the blessing of finance now); <br>  - think about moving abroad (if anyone is interested).  And that's exactly what I'm thinking about right now) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/144766/">https://habr.com/ru/post/144766/</a></p>
