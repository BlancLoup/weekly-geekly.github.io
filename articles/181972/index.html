All of them ensure the fulfillment of the necessary tasks and therefore their work must be integrated into the already debugged system of your company. <br>  Today we will talk about how we came up with a solution to this problem. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f0a/4a3/b18/f0a4a3b182cc6b3720eaee72a05c92b6.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Man and vehicle </h4><br>  If the work of mechanisms can be predicted, then the work of a person is often more difficult.  A truck that you sent to the other side of the country can suddenly follow a different route, the excavator will unexpectedly do archaeological excavations on weekends, and a company car will travel to the most beautiful places in our country and take part in night races on the way back. <br><br>  The maintenance of vehicles often makes up a significant part of the company's expenses; in order to grow and develop, it is necessary to understand what these expenses are and how to forecast them.

      Also, you may be faced with the task of simplifying the process of using official vehicles and equipment by the driver: easier check-in upon arrival and departure, informing you about passing critical points of the route. <br><br><h4>  The history of each car </h4><br>  We have developed a modular vehicle data collection system so that each company can find the most suitable solution for its tasks.  Now the condition of the car can be traced not only during a scheduled inspection, but also during operation.  This is a controller that monitors the parameters of traffic and sensors installed in it. <br><br>  Depending on the needs, the necessary set of equipment is compiled.  You can choose the optimal solution yourself, using <a href="http://moscow.megafon.ru/corporate/services/security/calc/">the service calculator on the MegaFon website</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/dd6/3b7/c1f/dd63b7c1fcf5bb6ff0d651eaa3d2bd66.png"><br><br>  The heart of the ‚Äú <a href="http://moscow.megafon.ru/corporate/services/security/control_autopark.html">Fleet Control</a> ‚Äù system is the central unit, which provides the main set of functions: it determines the coordinates of the vehicle, its speed and other parameters, stores and transmits data from sensors connected to it.  In addition, it is possible to connect to the on-board computer of the vehicle via <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAN_bus">CAN</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fleet_Management_System">FMS</a> tires. <br><br>  All functions can be divided into the following groups. <br><ul><li>  Fuel control </li><li>  Engine control </li><li>  Secondary functions </li></ul><br><br><h4>  Vehicle location </h4><br>  This is one of the most important issues that may arise from a taxi company dispatcher or a curator of a logistics company.  Thanks to the combined GPS / GLONASS sensor, now the location of the vehicle can be indicated without the need to communicate with the driver and distract him from the performance of the main tasks. <br><br>  Thanks to tracking the trajectory of movement, the dispatcher will be able to make a conclusion not only about the route, but also about such important parameters as: <br><ul><li>  Compliance with the speed limit. </li><li>  Visiting pre-marked areas on the map and tracking your time in these areas. </li><li>  Total vehicle mileage. </li></ul><br>  Thereby simplifying the task of drawing up travel sheets for the driver. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b7b/342/97e/b7b34297e953ad45825ae1930400f05d.png"><br>  <i>Intermediate parking on the route will also be marked in the system.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9f8/6ad/383/9f86ad38353d06be2c4a954fbcc6ec32.png"><br>  <i>Statistics of all cars in the garage complex</i> <br><br><h5>  Additional data </h5><br>  In addition to the main unit, the system can be supplemented with a set of useful sensors: <br><br>  <i>Fuel control</i> <br>  This is perhaps one of the main functions that allow you to save significant resources through more efficient use of purchased fuel. <br><br>  Data on fuel level and coordinates allow you to track not only the flow, but also compliance with the points indicated in the route for refueling. <br><br>  Since each manufacturer offers its own method of obtaining this data and it is difficult to find a universal solution for monitoring fuel, we use several types of sensors that differ in the principle of operation (capacity measurement, connection to a CAN or FMS bus.) <br><br>  <i>Monitoring the operation of the engine and mechanisms</i> <br>  It allows you to track the time and place of work of additional mechanisms installed on special equipment (crane boom, sweeping brush, reagent spreader, etc.).  Fuel consumption during operation of these mechanisms sometimes exceeds fuel consumption when the vehicle is in motion.  In addition, monitoring the use of mechanisms will allow to track cases of misuse of equipment. <br><br>  <i>Temperature control</i> <br>  It will help to monitor not only the working parameters of the car, but also the conditions for the transport of products, for example in the refrigerator of a truck, and in case of deviations send the car to service. <br><br>  <i>Weight control per vehicle axle</i> <br>  Relevant for freight transport, as it allows you to monitor whether the operating conditions of transport.  And if the weight increased or decreased during an unforeseen stop, draw the appropriate conclusions. <br><br>  <i>Shooting the route and the situation in the cabin</i> <br>  Having cameras in the car will always help to resolve a controversial situation.  Unlike vehicle operating parameters, recordings from DVRs are always stored locally, without being transferred to the server. <br>  The dispatcher has the ability to request a snapshot and get the current image from the camera. <br><br><h4>  Invisible assistant </h4><br><br>  Data on all collected indicators are transmitted throughout the route over the GSM network.  At the same time, if the connection was temporarily broken, the data will be saved locally and transferred at the next connection. <br><br>  We also provided an economy mode for roaming vehicles.  Depending on the need to quickly track vehicle data outside of Russia, the client can choose one of the operation modes: <br><ul><li>  By default, when going outside Russia, data transfer will be suspended until the vehicle appears on the MegaFon network (roaming).  Then the accumulated data in the memory will be transferred to the server and become available through the monitoring interface. </li><li>  If necessary, a roaming tariff can be activated, which will ensure data transmission online. </li></ul><br>  In order to optimize the amount of traffic that is transmitted towards the server, trajectory control algorithms are used: when the trajectory changes (for example, if the car makes a turn), the data is updated more often to better draw the trajectory.  With long-term rectilinear movement, data is updated less frequently. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b12/15e/924/b1215e92466676e6dae335c1bebdb9db.png"><br>  <i>A summary report allows you to see more detailed data and get an upload for additional analysis.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/126/eab/392/126eab39238162c93c6c92ad30561a77.png"><br>  <i>Sample fuel level report</i> <br><br>  The system can be recorded fuel consumption rates and schedules of use of vehicles. <br><br>  To collect data, use either the installation of sensors directly (for example, a fuel level sensor in a tank), or a connection to the on-board computer of a car that ‚Äúknows‚Äù how to collect this data.  As a rule, this solution is used on most foreign trucks. <br><br>  Each module of the system is protected and can work in quite difficult climatic conditions of our country.  When you try to intervene in the system, monitored disconnections with the sensors. <br><br><h5>  Quick communication with the dispatcher </h5><br>  We have provided the ability to automate some processes of using official vehicles.  The system installed on the vehicle can have up to 4 information buttons, when clicked, the position of the vehicle will be transmitted. <br><br>  This allows you to solve, for example, such issues as: <br><ul><li>  Delivery note </li><li>  Information on arrival at the loading point </li><li>  Informing of an emergency situation </li></ul><br><h4>  We construct </h4><br>  As you can see, we have a flexible system that can be used by both large logistics companies and organizations that have several vehicles in their fleet. <br><br>  We are ready together with you to find the best solution. <br><br>  We will be glad to your questions and suggestions in the comments. <br><br><h4>  Links </h4><br>  <a href="http://moscow.megafon.ru/corporate/services/security/control_autopark.html">Description of the service</a> on the MegaFon website with the ability <a href="http://moscow.megafon.ru/corporate/services/security/calc/">to choose a complete set and estimate its cost</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/181972/">https://habr.com/ru/post/181972/</a></p>
