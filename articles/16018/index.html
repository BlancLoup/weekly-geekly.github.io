  <section class="page js-page"><h1>7 crazy concept cars with Tokio Motor Show 2007</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  While the Russians slowly pulled over themselves winter fur coats and hats, getting used to the winter cold, another mega-show devoted to cars was held in the Japanese capital.  From October 26 to November 9, 2007, at the Tokio Motor Show 2008 exhibition, the mass of cars were presented, both very surprising and not so.  But the most interesting, of course, were concept cars.  I decided to select the seven most interesting projects from my point of view. <br><br>  7. Designers <strong>Nissan PIVO 2</strong> decided that the most terrible disease of the future will be loneliness.  Therefore, they built into the dashboard of this electronic psychoanalyst.  It can be seen in the photographs as a funny head of either a robot or Pokemon.  According to the authors, this head will recognize the driver's grimaces and tell him jokes in order to cheer up.  Or, on the contrary, to conduct soul-saving conversations, knocking down the adrenaline rush of rage in some traffic jam.  The car also provides two more seats for passengers, but apparently, PIVO engineers believe that they will be of little use.  But the wheels of the PIVO 2 can be turned by 90 degrees, and the cabin - for all 360. Therefore, the owner of the PIVO2 will be able to park where he wants and how he wants. <br><br> <a href="http://blogga.ru/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/36f/e41/10f/36fe4110f6337d8d37a164b95e94f9d7.jpg" alt="Nissan PIVO 2 - Concept Car Tokio Motor Show 2008"></a>

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  6. The Toyota company decided that for the microcar three wheels are enough.  Her model <strong>Toyota i-Real is</strong> not far from the usual scooter-scooter.  Is that added a chair and a pair of joysticks, which - yes, yes!  - and driven by this car of the future.  The maximum speed of i-Real is 30 km / h.  When accelerating, the seat drops a little, and at low speed it rises.  Apparently, these will be cars for driving inside the office. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/187/914/7cc/1879147cc055b7c6f6c1d654e2bc6590.jpg" alt="Toyota i-Real - Concept Car Tokio Motor Show 2008"><hr><br><br>  5. <strong>PIXY</strong> concept car from Suzuki looks much more comfortable - at least due to the fact that the driver in it is closed from external influences.  This micromachine is also not far from the idea of ‚Äã‚Äã‚Äúwheelchair-on-wheels‚Äù.  But Suzuki engineers offer a systematic approach.  According to their plans, PIXY should work as a personal capsule, which, if desired, can be ‚Äúinserted‚Äù into a sports car Suzuki SSF, a minibus Suzuki SSC and even a small boat Suzuki SSJ.  The driver doesn't even have to exit.  And, importantly, all these vehicles are already being developed and, quite likely, the day is close when we see them on the streets.  And hypodynamia will be declared the disease of the century ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b80/785/869/b80785869bd6d75e56fc707e7cc3c1d2.jpg" alt="Suzuki PIXY - Concept Car Tokio Motor Show 2008"><hr><br><br>  4. Honda decided to create the safest car.  The <strong>PUYO</strong> concept car looks like a real cushion on wheels.  And he is.  The car body is made of soft and elastic materials.  If you press on it with your finger, there will be a hole, which, however, will quickly disappear.  And at low speeds the little car can even run into pedestrians without risking their lives.  Imagine being hit with a huge pillow.  Approximately this effect will be in a frontal collision with PUYO. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f8d/ca6/feb/f8dca6feba50676bf77b3c25e70f943e.jpg" alt="Honda PUYO - Concept Car Tokio Motor Show 2008"><hr><br><br>  3. The exhibition featured cars with different numbers of wheels.  Including motorcycles.  Among them, the bright <strong>Suzuki BiPlane</strong> concept stood out with a bright yellow spot.  The name is due to the fact that its authors were inspired by the design of a classic biplane aircraft. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/11a/c52/db1/11ac52db129b269ebb85b3f8be90a6ab.jpg" alt="Suzuki BiPlane - Concept Bike Tokio Motor Show 2008"><hr><br><br>  2. One of the most interesting concept cars was the two-seater sports electric car <strong>Mitsubishi i-MIEV Sport</strong> .  It uses the power of the sun and wind thanks to the solar battery on the roof and the wind power generators in the grille and air intake.  However, the most unusual thing about him is that he became one of the first electric vehicles with such an elegant and sporty design.  One charge Mitsubishi i-MIEV lasts for 200 kilometers, and the maximum speed is 180 km / h. <hr><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c50/00e/c75/c5000ec754e77a275d315a540550879d.jpg" alt="Mitsubishi i-MIEV Sport - Concept Car Tokio Motor Show 2008"><hr><br><br>  1. But the most beautiful and most stylish definitely should recognize the concept car <strong>Mazda Taiki</strong> .  He looks like a Batman's car and it's not just the whim of a designer praying for comics.  Mazda engineers conducted a lot of experiments, trying to achieve the perfect aerodynamic shape for the body.  And they succeeded.  And along the way, the car acquired a crazy futuristic design, as if created for the next blockbuster about the adventures of a flying mouse-man. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e80/545/863/e8054586321b220df5ff486b8de7525c.jpg" alt="Mazda Taiki - Concept Car Tokio Motor Show 2008"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/704/466/dc1/704466dc10c9968692919f2537811c81.jpg" alt="Mazda Taiki - Concept Car Tokio Motor Show 2008"><br><br>  via <a href="http://blogga.ru/">Blogga</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/16018/">https://habr.com/ru/post/16018/</a></p>
