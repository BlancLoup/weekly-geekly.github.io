  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Sony SBH80 Headset Overview</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Stereo headset - perhaps the most necessary accessory for a smartphone.  Many phones come with wired headphones, but they usually do not stand up to scrutiny.  You have to bother searching for a separate headset.  With a variety of such devices today there are no problems, but if we talk about a quality device that does not let you down during training, driving or under other circumstances, the choice is not so wide.  Today we will find out how good the Sony SBH80 will be for everyday use. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/72d/843/8b9/72d8438b984d40faae8a3409da5aab41.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>Design and construction</b>

      The design of the SBH80 is clearly visible design "notes" of past models.  The basis of this model is a hard rim to which the headphones are attached.  The bezel is practically placed on the neck, thanks to which it is convenient to use the headset both on the go and in more intensive movement.  This design made it possible to place several important elements in the rim at once: an NFC module for quick pairing with smartphones, a 125 mAh battery, a microUSB connector for charging, a power button and even a miniature vibration motor for notifications. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/186/d48/433/186d48433ede4695871446e1c93e8168.jpg"><br><br>  Headphones are taken out of the case by thin wires and do not hinder movement in the working position at all - you can easily and naturally look around.  In addition to the central unit, located on the rim behind the neck, the headset has two auxiliary units.  They are the controls of voice calls and music playback. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/290/e34/b6a/290e34b6a59844ffbc3417c9d93b43f5.jpg"><br><br>  The total weight of the SBH80 does not exceed 16 grams, which means that the headset can be worn all day long on the neck without any special consequences.  The model is presented in black and white. <br><br>  <b>Management and nutrition</b> <br>  The control system is extremely simple: the left block is responsible for managing the music, the right block is responsible for all possible actions in the talk mode and for adjusting the volume.  On the left side there are three physical buttons: ‚Äúplay / pause‚Äù, as well as two keys for switching tracks forward and back.  The right block has the same number of buttons, but their functions are different: ‚Äúanswer / reset‚Äù, louder, quieter.  There are microphone slots on both blocks. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e8d/98b/56a/e8d98b56a1894edebf2310170c65d7a4.jpg"><br><br>  The stated work time is 9 hours of talk time or 6 hours of music playback.  Being in a passive mode SBH80 is able to hold about 650 hours.  As the weekly testing of the accessory showed, its real work time is almost the same as promised, and in the music mode, the headset managed to work for almost 7 hours instead of the stated six. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c8d/8e5/3e0/c8d8e53e02b044a7ae4f29f239097812.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Sound</b> <br>  The sound of the Sony SBH80 remains one of the best in the class.  Playback quality is unlikely to cause serious questions even among the most picky users.  True, it is worth remembering that we are talking about a wireless headset, which is focused more on gadzhetomanov than audiophiles. <br><br>  The interlocutors will also be satisfied: the voice is transmitted clearly and without undue interference.  Microphones are located well: they do not need to bring to his lips, audibility is already beautiful.  Only a very strong wind or extreme noise can create interference.  In the Moscow metro, for example, speaking through the SBH80 succeeds even more successfully than through the smartphone itself. <br><br>  <b>General impressions</b> <br>  Sony SBH80 uses Bluetooth version 3.0 with support for the aptX codec.  For quick connection of smartphones there is an NFC module that is compatible with all Android smartphones.  Among other features, it is worth highlighting the possibility of simultaneous work with two devices.  The sound quality is excellent, the autonomy is excellent, and the recommended price is 6590 rubles. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/392453/">https://habr.com/ru/post/392453/</a></p>
