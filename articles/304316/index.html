    <h5>  <b>Non-informative description of goods that could damage your business.</b> </h5><br>  It is no secret that a mean and non-informative description of the product can damage your e-commerce business. <br>  Firstly, a fresh description of the goods certainly will not inspire the buyer to purchase or will not give him enough information to make the right decision. <br><br>  Secondly, if you copy the description of the product of the manufacturer, your page or even your website may not be displayed correctly or correctly in search engines.  At the time of this writing, Google does not penalize sites for duplicate content, of course, if it does not consider that duplication was used fraudulently.  However, when confronted with duplicate content describing the product on several sites, Google can select only one site to show it in the search results. <br><br><h5>  <b>Creating product descriptions</b> </h5><br>  Considering the problem of the writing itself (difficulty in creating text) and the danger of publishing an informative description of the product (lower conversion or duplication of content), some online stores may want to use our simple product writing algorithm. <br><br>  The idea is simple: instead of sitting at the keyboard, staring at the product image and reprinting the manufacturer‚Äôs description in your own words, follow the process and analyze the tasks. <br><br><h5>  <b>Step 1</b> : Focus on a single moment. </h5><br>  Choose one important product.  Maybe this is some kind of feature or feature of the product, maybe this is how it should be used.  The main thing is to choose one thing. <br>  For example, imagine that you should have come up with a description of a soup spoon.  You can in the description, for example, tell about her large scoop - yes, the working end of the spoon is called scoop.  With this in mind, you can simply write one sentence describing this scoop.  This may be a short simple sentence. <br><br>  <i>This soup spoon has great scoop.</i> <br><br><h5>  <b>Step 2</b> : Tell me about the benefits. </h5><br>  So, the description of your product includes, according to the first step, one main characteristic, now we have to describe all the advantages of this characteristic and show the buyer what its benefits will be if he acquires this particular product. <br>  In marketing, they say that this is a bridge leading to success.  The fact is that this soup spoon has a relatively large scoop.  Thus, compared with spoons with smaller scoops, its advantage is that with each spoon you can eat more soup. <br><br>  <i>This soup spoon has a big scoop.</i>  <i>Eat soup in large portions and do not scatter on trifles.</i> <br><br><h5>  <b>Step 3</b> : Clarify and clarify </h5><br>  The dictionary tells us that ‚Äúclarification‚Äù is an action in which you make your statement less confusing and more comprehensive.  In addition, clarification is also the complete identification of something. <br>  In the third stage of the mechanical process of writing texts, add words, phrases or comments that will make the product description clearer and more understandable. <br>  There is a little ambiguity in our current description of the soup spoon.  This spoon is large compared to what?  How big is it?  So let's add a sentence that makes this comparison more explicit. <br><br>  <i>This soup spoon has great scoop.</i>  <i>Three times more soup is placed in it than in a regular tablespoon.</i>  <i>Eat soup in large portions and do not scatter on trifles.</i> <br><br>  You will also find out that the other end of the spoon is called ‚Äúheld.‚Äù  Scooped, as mentioned above, is part of the spoon where food is scooped.  And the ‚Äúconnecting bridge‚Äù is a transition from scoop to hollow. <br>  But few buyers truly understand the description of these components.  This way we can add a little more clarity. <br><br>  <i>This soup spoon has a large scoop - the part with which you bring food to your mouth.</i>  <i>Three times more soup is placed in it than in a regular tablespoon.</i>  <i>Eat soup in large portions and do not scatter on trifles.</i> <br><br><h5>  <b>Step 4</b> : Check Your Words </h5><br>  Read and re-read the product description several times.  Your main task is to identify and possibly replace those words or phrases that are repeated too often. <br>  In my example, the word "soup" is repeated five times out of forty two words.  This is not bad, considering that we are describing a soup spoon.  But if we replace this word in at least one meta, we will have far fewer repetitions. <br>  One way to replace the general concept of soup is to use specific words.  For example, we can give specific types of soups, such as "soup", "broth". <br><br>  <i>This soup spoon has a large scoop (the part with which you bring food to your mouth).</i>  <i>It contains three times more broth than a regular tablespoon.</i>  <i>Eat soup in large portions and do not scatter on trifles.</i> <br><br>  Using variations of the same word will also reduce repeatability.  For example, instead of the word "soup" use "soup". <br><br>  <i>This soup spoon has a large scoop (the part with which you bring food to your mouth).</i>  <i>Three times more soup is placed in it than in a regular tablespoon.</i>  <i>Eat soup in large portions and do not scatter on trifles.</i> <br><br>  As you read and re-read the product description, your next task in testing words is to add dynamic words.  The description of the action of the soup spoon is good in itself, but we could replace part of the sentence ‚Äú <i>It fits three times more broth</i> ‚Äù with ‚Äú <i>we can scoop three times more broth into it</i> ‚Äù.  This replacement will add a bit more dynamism and, again, will help get rid of repeating the same words. <br><br>  <i>This soup spoon has a large scoop (the part with which you bring food to your mouth).</i>  <i>you can scoop up three times more borsch in it than in a regular tablespoon.</i>  <i>Eat soup in large portions and do not scatter on trifles.</i> <br><br><h5>  <b>Step 5</b> : Spell and Punctuation </h5><br>  Applications like Google Docs and Hemingway will help you easily check spelling and punctuation.  If you use these tools, then Step 5 deserves your attention. <br>  If your product description passed the literacy test, re-read it once or twice and then publish. <br><br><h5>  <b>Optional: add an introductory part</b> </h5><br>  You may have a suitable product description, but still you can add the final touch, like a cherry on a cake. <br>  To describe the soup spoon, try adding a phrase that sets the tone.  Something that can make a buyer start thinking about soup. <br><br>  <i>Are you going to taste the rich Ukrainian borscht?</i>  <i>Then you just can not do without a suitable spoon.</i>  <i>This soup spoon differs in that it has a large scoop (the part with which you bring food to your mouth).</i>  <i>In it, you can scoop three times more borscht than in a regular tablespoon.</i>  <i>Eat in large portions and do not share small things.</i> <i><br></i> <br>  By thinking about creating product descriptions step by step, you can make this task less complicated.  But we have listed only some methods, there are also many others that we will share later. <br><br>  Sincerely yours, Yambox full-line operator <br>  (we are engaged in logistics for e-commerce) <br><br>  By the way, taking this opportunity, I want to advertise our new affiliate program. <br>  We pay <b>5,000</b> rubles for good recommendations. <br><br>  It's simple, recommend our company to your friends who have an online store, and we will pay you 5,000 rubles in the event that they become our customers. <br><br>  <a href="http://landing.yamboks.ru/partner/">Details here</a> <br><br><hr><br> <a href="http://landing.yamboks.ru/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/99f/dd1/e17/99fdd1e179c04948b9c7a06a27087b7b.jpg" alt="image"></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/304316/">https://habr.com/ru/post/304316/</a></p>
