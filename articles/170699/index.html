Today is one of those days. <br><br>  I noticed that the Android brand disappears with time.  First was the Nexus, then Samsung introduced the Galaxy brand, which reduced the relevance of Android.  Today, Android is almost invisible.

      At first, I thought that Google was simply losing the war to its partners.  But then I realized that all this is no accident.  This is not just a trend.  This is a conscious policy.  From Google. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  Android was everywhere at Mobile World Congress last year.  His zone was the largest, and it was mainly about Android and only a little bit about the manufacturers of the equipment. <br><br>  This year (by the way, if you are going to Barcelona and want to meet, let me know) Android is not at all.  Neither zone nor stand.  He disappeared. <br><br>  If you read about the new HTC One, you could never find any mention of Android.  HTC is trying to promote only its own brand, and Android - <a href="http://inoblogger.ru/2013/02/26/htc-one-android/">far on the periphery</a> .  Disappeared <br><br>  Of course, Android is leading.  So in the lead, selling just an ‚ÄúAndroid phone‚Äù means participating in a cheap distribution business.  Nobody needs it, but you need to be cool and different from others.  Let Android deal with Chinese clone factories. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a61/2ca/7c6/a612ca7c66c981564d816737ca28934d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  But the matter is not only in equipment manufacturers.  The brand is killing Google itself.  She left Android when the Android Market turned into Google Play, and now she distances herself from him even more. <br><br>  She wants the brand to be Google, not Android. <br><br>  Is that a risk?  Not sure.  Who is interested in Android?  Developers.  For developers only. <br><br>  Even if you blur the brand, developers will still be aware of ;-) It doesn't matter to them.  You can not lose developers only because of the removal of emphasis from the brand. <br><br>  But two different brands confuse consumers.  For example, now Google is going to open brand stores.  She bought a manufacturer of technology.  It is changing, and it needs Google to be everywhere. <br><br>  Who knows the word iOS?  Nobody (well, you know, but you are a geek). <br><br>  People on the street know Apple.  They know the iPhone and iPad.  And iOS is for geeks.  iOS is hidden inside.  For those who can distinguish the V12 engine from the V6 (see, maybe even you are not a geek). <br><br>  Android is now so dominant that it can be killed.  Because it is only inside.  And what is important is what is outside. <br><br>  Android is no more.  He is killed by his own father. <br><br>  Believe me, you want to buy google. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/170699/">https://habr.com/ru/post/170699/</a></p>
