In fact, a terrible death is still ahead. <br><br>  The study of the <a href="http://www.flurry.com/data/index.html">marketing company Flurry (Flurry)</a> , a link to which I gave, showed that the proportion of money spent on advertising on TV and radio, roughly coincides with the proportion of time spent by people on TV and radio.  And the share of money spent on advertising in print is about five times more than the time spent reading this press.

      In other words, despite the reduction in the printing industry, the advertising industry still greatly overestimates its potential. <br><br>  Good, but since advertisers overestimate the effectiveness of advertising in print, it means that other media remain undeservedly deprived of their attention, right?  The study shows that although the web turned out to be such a deprived segment, in fact, the real potential is hidden in the mobile sector.  Consumers give him 23% of their attention, and advertisers spend only 1% of their budgets on it. <br><br>  As far as I understood from the research, analysts considered the percentage of attention by the amount of time spent by people on working with iOS and Android devices.  But I spend a lot of time on my iPhone on viewing websites, and it is unclear to me which category the ads placed on these websites fell into.  If there are a lot of people like me, then the border separating the web and mobile sector is very vague. <br><br>  In any case, it becomes clear from the study - so far the advertising industry is lagging behind the development of user behavior patterns, and there is a lot of space for advertising money in the web and mobile sector.  Whatever way of delivering advertising is chosen in order to reach the right audience, now the price of this report is incomparable with the time people spend on these media.  But advertisers have no reason to chase.  At some point, the market will even out, and most of the money now going to print will go online. <br><br>  Let's also not forget that advertising is just one of the sources of income for print.  What do I do when I do not look at the sites on my tablet?  I read e-books.  Those who read my articles a long time know that I am a fan of these books.  I hope the study of Flarry will push you to this segment of the market.  Since people spend more and more time on the Internet and mobile devices, digital publishers have a chance to sell directly and advertise in e-books, apps, movies, and God knows what else. <br><br>  The picture described in the study may coincide with your point of view on the process of dying of the news industry, whether you consider this a verdict for the press or a part of the gold rush of online media.  The fact that the leadership of newspapers, which has banished all destroyers and innovators from its industry, cannot figure out how to make money online, does not mean that this money cannot be made there at all.  The study should clarify these possibilities. <br><br>  Editorial waiting for an even greater reduction.  Companies that rely on professionals dedicated to the press will continue to lose their market share and die.  There is plenty of money on the market for professionals who can find a way to link the interests of advertisers and consumers on the web and mobile better than a paper newspaper does. <br><br>  The picture is clear.
