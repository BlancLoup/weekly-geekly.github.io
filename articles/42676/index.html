  <section class="page js-page"><h1>"Office without plankton" (c) Novaya Gazeta</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> ‚ÄúCowsheds for homeworkers‚Äù created in Moscow <br><br>  Freelancers (freelancers) in major cities of the world over the past three years have created a new model of work - co-working (co-working).  Instead of working at home, modern homeworkers rent a common area and, while remaining free, work together, communicate and exchange experience, orders and customers.  In the middle of the year, coworking came to the territory of the CIS - first to Kiev, then Yekaterinburg and St. Petersburg;  in the project the creation of coworking centers in Togliatti, Alushta, Odessa, Perm, Omsk. <br><br>  There is no full-fledged coworking in Moscow, although repeated attempts have been made.  What it is, how it looks in the regions and here, what happened and what did not, and what awaits the capital co-working in the future - in the material of our correspondent. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The dimly lit empty corridors of the Moscow State University of Economics, Statistics and Informatics (MESI) are filled with the faint smell of buns and a canteen.  Over the wide white door leading to the narrow staircase of the third floor there is the first, the only and yet not yet officially opened <a href="http://co-pie.blogspot.com/">Co-pie</a> metropolitan <a href="http://co-pie.blogspot.com/">co-working</a> center - almost deserted 700 square meters.  The labyrinth of endless gray office partitions makes the room look like a honeycomb, in which young people quietly work here and there.  Sasha, the administrator, gives me a tour: 
      <br>

      ‚ÄúHere is a meeting room, here the guys work, here is a warehouse of unused furniture, and here we have a toilet,‚Äù Sasha opens the door slightly and shows the tiled entrance hall, in which there is a nightstand, a trash can with an ashtray, chairs, a chair and a white board.  A woman and a man are sitting at the table and discussing something.  - Here you can smoke, and all important issues are solved, as a rule, here. <br><br>  Shows me a rest room - the same sector as the rest, but with glass tables, a large brown leather sofa, multi-colored plastic chairs, a cupboard with provisions (mostly cookies) and a microwave, a magnetic white board and an office altar - water cooler.  On the blackboard with a red and green markers, a puffy, playful heading ‚ÄúHIKELI‚Äù is displayed, under which the clients of the center write down what they lack for happiness.  Among other things - telephone, punching bag, pull-up bar, refrigerator and private toilet. <br>  <a href="http://co-pie.blogspot.com/">Co-pie</a> is the first company in the capital to offer services for the delivery of jobs through the subscriber system.  This means that the freelancer or start-up business company, who is inconvenienced to work at home, instead of trying to find an office for big money and work on its equipment, pays three to four times less and receives, firstly, a full-fledged place for work, secondly, the working atmosphere, and thirdly, the most important thing is the opportunity to grow professionally and communicate among ‚Äúcongenial‚Äù people.  The basis of the co-working philosophy is a small labor exchange, where orders, customers, experiences and ideas are constantly exchanged. <br><br>  A workplace fee is, in effect, a monthly membership fee that opens the way to a ‚Äúnatural business incubator,‚Äù as its founder Nikita Filippov calls <a href="http://co-pie.blogspot.com/">Co-pie</a> : <br><br>  ‚ÄúCoworking is a place where you can work and not spend 30-40% of your time to speak like the boss of a big company:‚Äú So, Zinochka, do not forget this piece of paper.  And so that.  Ideally, a co-working center is an office like Google‚Äôs: you are fed, watered, the workplace is somehow overwhelmed, informal relationships reign.  They care about you, and you should only work.  And everything is built on personal motivation. <br><br>  In order to get as close as possible to the ideal, the organizers of the co-working center conduct ‚Äúalpha testing‚Äù at the expense of the comments and wishes of a few customers who appeared after an unofficial opening in early September.  A full opening for all comers is planned for the coming days. <br><br>  In the CIS, coworking came three years after its appearance (see ‚Äúunder the text‚Äù).  The first office opened in Kiev, then in St. Petersburg and Yekaterinburg.  The work on opening centers in Alushta, Odessa, Perm, Omsk and Tolyatti is going on. <br><br>  Alexey Glazkov from Ekaterinburg, 23, founder of one of the most interesting co-working offices in the CIS, tells about his experience: <br><br>  - The concept of ‚Äúco-working‚Äù appeared in my life, probably about five months ago - then an article from the New York Times about an American programmer who decided to combine the advantages of office and home-life work appeared on the Webplanet website.  I was very interested in the note, and when I read it to my partner Stanislav Bodagin, who is well aware of my goals (Alexey implements the 7-year plan for creating a structure that would "support commercially and psychologically", he said : ‚ÄúAnd what should we do? Let's do it?‚Äù And we, in the best traditions of Branson, sent everything to hell and began to ‚Äúdo coworking.‚Äù <br><br>  Alexey and several people who joined him inspected about 20 different premises, arranged a vote in the large Internet community ‚ÄúHabrahabr‚Äù and chose a four-story tower with a spiral staircase in the building opposite the railway station.  Alexey describes the current organization of work in the ‚ÄúTower‚Äù as ‚Äúcommunal work‚Äù: as a hostel at the university, only here it is not the students who live, but the people who work. <br><br>  Recently, the participants of the "Tower" positioned themselves on the foreign market as a cohesive organization.  Their ability to ‚Äútasty cook‚Äù various businesses from a state of mind to at least a startup * made it possible to call themselves people providing the services of ‚Äúproject management‚Äù and ‚Äúdevelopment of new business lines‚Äù: <br><br>  ‚ÄúMany companies are not opposed to expanding their development area into another 1-2 areas,‚Äù says Alexey, ‚Äúbut often they don‚Äôt have a clue what to do, or they don‚Äôt have enough people to do it.  Then they create a vacancy for the ‚Äúproject manager‚Äù and try to find a person who would quickly ‚Äúdrive‚Äù into the topic and do the right job.  It is then that we appear, all in white, and sell our services under the same conditions that were put forward by the company (that is, the same monthly salary, quality and terms).  At the same time, the company receives not one employee, with whom certain expenses and risks are associated, but the whole team, which will work faster, and will vouch for the result. <br><br>  The main plus and quality of coworking in the ‚ÄúTower‚Äù was fully realized: the presence of professionals of various specialties (among them an accountant, a lawyer, advertisers, programmers) led to the fact that powerful brain storms occur and all questions and problems are solved instantly.  Very often, Alexey rejoices, due to the fact that people have a different vision of the world, they manage to get an answer to an exciting question without getting up from the chair: <br><br>  - This is an absolutely amazing thing.  I have never met such synergy before, although I had a chance to work in four different companies, to see the work of a dozen others.  There is some vague tension in them.  And here everything is decided by itself. <br><br>  Now Alexey Glazkov spends all his time on the expansion and improvement of the co-working network in his native city.  The plans include the creation of functionally separate offices: soon ‚ÄúInzhi‚Äù opens under the engineering theme, ‚ÄúAdium‚Äù for holding seminars and conferences, ‚ÄúIntro‚Äù for receiving clients ‚Äúon the highest level‚Äù. <br><br>  In Moscow, since the beginning of the year, several attempts were made, but only the initiative of 22-year-old Nikita Filippov and Dmitry Kuznetsov was crowned with success. <br><br>  Moskovorking, which for a long time was called the first office in the capital of the new model, is represented by a poorly functioning website.  There is no contact phone, answers do not come to the letters.  A similar situation with the center "Life Creativity Lab.", The opening of which was announced at the beginning of September.  The expectations and calculations of the creators of the office ‚ÄúFor friends‚Äù at the Belorusskaya metro station did not materialize, so they decided to open a store in the newly renovated premises. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThere are two important points why coworking works in Yekaterinburg and in St. Petersburg,‚Äù comments Nikita Filippov.  - First: the cheaper office rental market.  Secondly, there are, as a rule, friends who are limited to a large rental apartment.  Their main goal is to reduce monthly costs.  Moscow is a slightly different city, more mature, more capricious.  Here to make it harder. <br><br>  Now ‚ÄúCo-pie‚Äù services are used by 13 people.  These are employees of the not yet launched Roomix three-dimensional online furniture catalog;  Tunestory music podcast;  Muzicons Music Entertainment Generator, Addventure Business Angels Foundation;  designers of the online game "Superheroes";  as well as employees of the Internet project "Kinokrug". <br><br>  According to forecasts of Co-pie CEO Dmitry Kuznetsov, it will take a little more than a month to fill the office.  A person who wants to work in a coworking office must submit his resume and portfolio, recommendations from former employers.  This is necessary for the organizers to understand whether a person is suitable for them. <br><br>  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not possible to plant absolutely incompatible people nearby,‚Äù says Nikita Filippov.  - The antisocial type will either drop a drop of tar, or will kill everyone.  Therefore, those who say about us that we supposedly stupidly rent a "bed" for work are wrong.  Our task is not to let the situation go out of control.  I want everyone to be a public good - everyone is happy.  Spun the light bulb and immediately see that all is well. <br><br>  To the question ‚ÄúWhat awaits coworking in Moscow?‚Äù The creators of Co-pie answer that they can only guess: <br><br>  ‚ÄúWe want coworking to develop,‚Äù says Nikita Filippov, ‚Äúthis is really convenient.  I think that, despite the Russian uniqueness and our ‚Äúspecial path‚Äù that everyone likes to talk about, the model that has taken root in the West will take root in our country.  Perhaps this will turn, as in the West, into a new work style: people work for themselves in this cube, co-working, into which orders are poured, as in one big company.  And there they are already scattered inside, as on the exchange. <br><br>  It is clear that attempts to open offices will still be undertaken.  The question is how best to do this so that everything works.  The guys themselves are going to make three or four more offices in Moscow in the spring, and in the summer they will start going to the regions.  They will start with Tver, so that, as a joke Dmitry Kuznetsov says, ‚Äúgo through the stage‚Äù.  The following ‚Äúspaces‚Äù will look less office - now the MESI management imposes certain restrictions on the appearance. <br><br>  Yevgeny Savin, the general director of the Datigra company, calls coworking ‚Äúthe cowshed‚Äù.  His company is going to open the Green Cowshed in Moscow after the New Year: <br><br>  - Coworking should consist in a chain of projects, events.  We have five different projects: informational, venture financing, the creation and maintenance of startups, events for investors and startups and, in fact, co-working itself.  It is important for us that all these five projects create interaction with each other.  A barn is part of a chain, without which it would not be effective.  After all, this is a place where the community, a community that cannot be touched, becomes real, accessible.  As part of the infrastructure, Korovnik itself will be filled with people and will become the center of meetings and events.  This is still quite different compared to the simple delivery of office space. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/42676/">https://habr.com/ru/post/42676/</a></p>
