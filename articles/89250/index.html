  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Insurance. Part I: Do-it-Yourself Insurance Calculators</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In order to attract customers to an insurance company, it is important not only to come up with ‚Äúbeautiful‚Äù insurance products, but also to bring information about them to customers, and also to do everything possible to simplify product design.  The most effective way for these purposes today is the Internet.  A company with remote product clearance has an advantage.  This tool is the most effective web site on which anyone can take out insurance of interest to him without any intermediaries. <br><br>  The insurance products market is notable for its complexity: data matrices, entangled logical relationships, ratios, risks, etc.  It takes a lot of time to create each insurance product, and no less for the implementation of an ‚Äúelectronic‚Äù calculator. <br><br>  Is it realistic to create mechanisms for selling insurance products over the Internet without attracting contractors, a team of programmers and not spending a lot of time?  Yes, we made it possible.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br>  Imagine the situation.  The underwriter (essentially the person creating the insurance product as a service) came up with a new product.  He was approved by the management and it is necessary to immediately make it possible to purchase it on the company's website.  The underwriter goes to the developer and he calls him the term for the implementation of the calculator form per week.  A week goes by, the developer programs the form using sophisticated bells and whistles from various web technologies to implement everything requested by the underwriter.  A week later, an underwriter comes in and reports an inaccuracy found in his product, which entails if not a remake half of the form, then certainly a lot of work on rewriting the code of business logic.  An implementation error, changed management plans, etc. may be found.  There can be a lot of such iterations, each editing confuses and complicates the life of the developer, as well as the product he creates.  But in the end it may turn out that during the time that the form for the site was programmed, the insurance product is already outdated.  You should not forget about documenting, so that in the event of the loss of a key developer, the company will not lose the ability to quickly make changes to its website. <br><br>  Insurance products can appear frequently, as well as changes in them can be made every week: the coefficient has changed somewhere, a new field has been added, which interacts with others, etc.  How much effort will web developers need to create functionality for each new unique form of insurance product costing? <br><br>  The <a href="http://www.adv.ru/">ADV</a> company understood this situation and tried to organize such a center for creating insurance products that would not require special programming (as well as expensive specialists) to implement the wide range of required tasks.  ADV has developed an Insurance product for insurance companies.  <a href="http://www.adv.ru/product/insurance/">Insurance</a> is a system that allows you to create an online agency for the sale of insurance policies with a minimum number of staff. <br><br>  Since the insurance calculator is a set of data, forms of presentation and interactions of these entities, the emerging MVC (Model-View-Controller) was chosen as the architecture, and a special XML format was used as a method for describing calculators.  Everything is obvious, simple and documented. <br><br>  In the process of creating a universal mechanism for programming calculators, many existing insurance products were analyzed (not limited to such popular ones as CASCO and CTPL) in order to build into the possibilities the most complete and universal set of functions.  In fact, it turned out a product with which you can implement new ideas of the underwriter in a few days and in a few minutes or hours to make an edit to an existing product without any programming, only by changing the structure of the XML description. <br><br>  In addition, in the center of the creation of insurance products were provided such important opportunities as versioning, preview.  You see, you often don‚Äôt want to work ‚Äúlively‚Äù, but just in case, you don‚Äôt want to lose the old versions either.  Therefore, the programmer can simply copy the current active calculator, thereby creating a new version, make some changes to it, check the work directly in the site interface and after that activate the new version, automatically turning off the old one. <br><br>  Of course, we have not forgotten about the convenience of working with the insurance product for the client.  Since most of the forms are fairly massive amounts of data, it was decided to actively use AJAX technology along with a thoughtful and beautiful interface.  In the process of creating a new calculator, the programmer does not need to think about how the functionality will look on the site, since  Under all the cases, a beautiful and convenient output of information to the client is already provided.  Customization tools allow you to customize the appearance of the functional to the needs of the company, corporate identity, the overall style of the website. <br><br>  So, Insurance is: <br><ul><li>  online store, created on modern technologies with a friendly user interface; </li><li>  Back Office - a multifunctional interface for working with orders, users, various statistics and other features; </li><li>  universal insurance calculator designer. </li></ul><br><br>  Main functions: <br><ul><li>  Back office automation: <ul><li>  insurance product description center; </li><li>  control of the policy process from the application to the payment; </li><li>  the ability to customize policy forms; </li><li>  detailed sales statistics. </li></ul></li><li>  Ability to integrate with any internal information systems of the company. </li><li>  Online Store: <ul><li>  acceptance of electronic payments using VISA, MasterCard, Yandex.Money, Webmoney; </li><li>  flexible adjustment of the insurance product calculation system; </li><li>  flexible customization of the catalog of insurance products; </li><li>  online chat with an insurance agent; </li><li>  feedback collection forms. </li></ul></li><li>  Access to work materials from anywhere in the world: <ul><li>  No software installation is required, the system works through a regular browser. </li></ul></li></ul><br><br>  All the information received needs to be further processed; for this, a back office with several modules was implemented.  Insurance back-office allows you to control the entire order chain, print policies on letterheads, process notifications from electronic payment systems.  In addition, the back office provides detailed reporting on the dynamics of sales for all insurance products for the entire duration of the online store.  In addition, the system allows you to make a cross-sales report for each product, as well as a detailed report on what stages of calculator filling people most often leave the site. <br><br>  Registered and authorized in the system, the client can easily not only see information on the ordered / purchased insurance products, but also extend those whose deadline expires.  The system will most effectively help him to do this by filling out new forms of product design with the data entered earlier. <br><br>  Insurance product is flexible enough for integration with corporate information systems: SAP, Oracle, Navision, 1 and any others. <br><br>  The means of interaction with partners help to organize cooperation not only by the type of affiliate-partnership, but also by the principle of organizing cooperation with other companies, for example, in the banking or tourism sector, where insurance for a loan or a trip abroad is also required.  If your company delegates the delivery of policies to customers and the collection of money to a contracting company, for example, a courier service, then you can automate with the Insurance section of processing orders, even on the side of this contractor.  To do this, the Insurance back-office has a section for contractors in which only those contracts that are marked ‚Äúfor delivery‚Äù status fall.  Courier staff can change the status of an order as it is processed. <br><br>  If your company has a call-center, then for effective work it requires operational information.  For the convenience of automating the call-center, there are special sections in the Insurance back-office where all the necessary information for work is immediately displayed on one page. <br><br>  Online chat will facilitate prompt resolution of issues if your company has a consultant who will be in charge of correspondence with customers. <br><br>  Needless to say, all the features discussed above are accessible via a web browser and do not require installation of any special software on users' computers. <br><br>  In conclusion, I would like to note that the Insurance product has a very versatile set of tools, so it can be used in related markets.  For example, a car dealer may post on its website a form for calculating the cost of a car loan.  The banking sector can use Insurance to provide visitors to their sites quickly and rely on sending requests for personal loans for any purpose. <br><br>  What's next?  Perhaps, it will be interesting to someone, and I will tell you how the creation of a form for registration of insurance takes place without much effort.
