  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Remains 11.11 are sweet: 7 more nice devices</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The attitude towards Chinese shops is different, but buyers always keep an eye on them.  The secret is simple - brands and models that are not afraid to experiment with shells, design, e-filling and value for money are represented at the sites.  This is not surprising - China has acted as a manufacturer of components and a worldwide assembly shop so much that a critical mass of knowledge and experience has accumulated.  The result of using this baggage skill was the formation of daring Chinese brands, a variety of gadgets and accessories for them.  By accessing the website of the online store, the buyer expects to meet something interesting, not banal, and meets each time.  Today we have selected 7 interesting and popular with customers gadgets, which are still involved in the sale. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/206/934/c4c/206934c4c3df6eca74b07a27cc5480c5.png"></div><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In general, if you look at the global economy and its time cycles, China rather quickly managed to regain some of the name of the manufacturer of good products in the field of wearable gadgets and electronics.  In Barcelona, ‚Äã‚Äãthe already well-known Xiaomi was presented with deafening success, the component supplier had entered the market earlier, and now the DOOGEE smartphone brand, the flagship Meizu.  And these are the most vivid examples.  Today we have chosen products that are not just participating in the <a href="http://sale.jd.ru/act/cDUrj6Bakwy4oJI.html">sale (and she found a second round from 14 to 20 November)</a> , but are thoughtful devices that can satisfy the needs of consumers of any level of confusion. <br><br>  The <a href="http://www.jd.ru/1186285.html">Umi London</a> smartphone for $ 59.99 is a good reason to get acquainted with the Umi brand, which produces inexpensive and stable smartphones.  The 5-inch display is protected by tempered glass that is resistant to household falls (you should not test from 90 meters), the case is made of aluminum alloy, lightweight and durable.  Onboard 1GB RAM + 8GB ROM - you can‚Äôt overclock it, you can safely give your child as the first smartphone for ‚Äúwant-want‚Äù.  The main camera is 8 megapixel and quite decent, the front one is 2 megapixel, hardly for selfie lovers.  But the smartphone has a good battery of 2050 mAh and Android 6.0, which works well despite not very advanced TTX. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f7f/672/c8f/f7f672c8f33fa5a057364dd698816707.jpg"></div><br>  Honestly, we ourselves were waiting for the appearance of the <a href="http://www.jd.ru/1212227.html">Elephone C1</a> on sale - and not so much because of the combination of excellent features and the price of $ 109.99, but because of the desire to look at this stunning sapphire blue color.  In general, the blue color in the technique at first glance always seems unusual - but then invariably causes a wow-effect among friends and only pleasant visual sensations from use.  So it was with laptops and tablets of two famous brands, so it will be with this smartphone.  But not a single color - a 5.5-inch display, a very thin frame of the case, a slight bend of the back cover - five-plus tactile sensations.  MTK6737 Quad Core 1.3GHz processor, Android 6.0, 2GB RAM + 16GB ROM, 8 megapixel main camera and 2 megapixel front, dual SIM, work in LTE networks and a fingerprint scanner - a good set for a working, business phone that does not have to take a selfie to white heat.  Great story to stand out and a completely new model.

The peculiarity of the model is an all-metal sturdy case, which, thanks to the bends, is excellent in the hand, despite the 5-inch display.  The smartphone supports lettering on the display for calling applications.  For the price of $ 109.99, the smartphone has quite a good stuffing: an eight-core MTK6753 processor, 3GB of RAM, 16GB of internal memory, a 13 megapixel camera, work in 4G LTE networks, a fingerprint scanner, OTG.  In combination with a 3060 mAh battery, the phone is very worthy.  It weighs only 150 grams, but thanks to the metal case it feels like a very pleasant device and will suit both men and women, the benefit of which is implemented in three stylish steel shades. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/cfb/309/4de/cfb3094defbe4d93e33bf7fc2aac513d.jpg"></div><br>  About this smartphone you could write an excellent marketing text about lovers of winter fishing, ski races and other extreme lovers who know the price of a protected smartphone.  But no, because <a href="http://www.jd.ru/1193884.html">HOMTOM HT20 is</a> suitable for anyone who wants not to worry about the safety of the device, hates covers, and finally wants to stand out among the black lacquer rectangles.  Even among the girls there are military lovers.  The smartphone is equipped with IP68 protection, quad-core processor, Android 6.0 operating system, 2GB RAM and 16GB of internal memory, works in 4G LTE networks.  It's all on the trend.  But the main thing is a 4.7 "display, a surface that lies firmly in the hand (which only a wolverine will scratch) and a capacious 3500 mAh battery. It weighs 227 grams. In general, it is from the world of smartphones. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/482/f09/010/482f09010fd0b5498f8b0985a4cffe6d.jpg"></div><br>  <s>From pop music you will not escape</s> .  On the site, sellers offer many interesting models of famous Chinese brands.  For example, <a href="http://www.jd.ru/1177380.html">Meizu Pro 6</a> on the MediaTek Helio X25 chipset with 4GB of RAM, a 5.2-inch display and a Meizu 3D Press fingerprint scanner.  The operating system is Flyme 6.1 based on Android 6.0, a ten-core processor (pulls everything - three clusters of 4 Cortex-A53 and 1.4 GHz + 4 Cortex-A53 2 GHz + 2 Cortex-A72 at a frequency of 2.5 GHz).  The smartphone is issued and the camera - 21 megapixel, 6 lenses, video recording in 4K.  The battery is modest - 2560 mAh, but the optimization of the system and the redistribution of tasks across clusters of cores allows the phone not to lose the owner (or vice versa) ahead of time.  Of the strange flaws with all the steepness - no NFC. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c4b/2a1/d02/c4b2a1d02fe688213de0a8f4afc5cab6.jpg"></div><br>  Traditionally, we cannot bypass other interesting gadgets in our reviews.  This time, two came under the scope: a vacuum cleaner and ... a vacuum cleaner.  If you tried to demonstrate a flat disk robot vacuum cleaner to your parents, then you probably ran a racket about the fact that he doesn‚Äôt take anything away, rolls for nothing, and in general ‚Äúoh, you're with these toys of yours, Buran used to be ...‚Äù.  In general, they don‚Äôt like the form factor, although donating a vacuum cleaner for the New Year does not seem like a bad idea.  Therefore, today there are no cat litters - just familiar tubes.  Well, more precisely, not quite familiar. <br><br>  For $ 79.90 a novelty of 2016 is available - a handheld mini-vacuum cleaner <a href="http://www.jd.ru/1212015.html">PUPPYOO WP521</a> .  The piece is noiseless, weighs only 2.25 kg, has a capacity of 600 W, a dust collector of 1.2 liters, a cord of 5 meters, three interchangeable tips for accessing all corners.  The telescopic tube is folded and it is very convenient to vacuum upholstered furniture and surfaces.  Suitable for daily cleaning of the nursery, kitchen, for collecting wool during the molting of pets (for this there is also a brush).  By the way, the filters are also very good - the dust will not leak. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a37/425/b66/a37425b66161acdd01b57d738212d6cc.jpg"></div><br>  Well, quite familiar to the storm / cyclone / siemens - <a href="http://www.jd.ru/1226805.html">PUPPYOO D-17</a> for $ 109.90.  It has four power modes, a good filtration system (the HEPA filter will protect even allergy sufferers), a 2.5-liter dust collector without any dust bags.  Maximum power - 1700W, noise less than 68 dB.  The vacuum cleaner weighs 5.3 kg.  Successful, modern model. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e86/280/5a7/e862805a7ea8abe52c6696b662038207.jpg"></div><br>  Well, there are still a lot of activities and discounts on any goods (and not just gadgets), fair discounts and quality models.  The main thing is to be attentive, to use the ‚ÄúFavorites‚Äù section, not to lose sight of coupons - there are many opportunities to save money.  Below prices are unlikely to be - it's time to think about the New Year holidays, especially since the mail rush to no one will benefit. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/398923/">https://habr.com/ru/post/398923/</a></p>
