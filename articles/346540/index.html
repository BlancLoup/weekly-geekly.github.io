  <section class="page js-page"><h1>On the problems of determining the location of the subscriber when he calls 112</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Since last year, mobile operators have provided the system-112 with information about the location of the subscriber who called or sent an SMS to the number 112. In the Voronezh region, it works just over a month - enough time to face the main problems of implementing this service.  And given that the service for telecom operators is global, these difficulties are to some extent present in all regions of the country. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zd/bh/4h/zdbh4hnk6cfzudzrjbd-cebh_ce.png"><br><br>  Under the cat are listed problems and our suggestions to the Ministry of Communications on their elimination. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Briefly about determining the location of the subscriber during his call to 112 </h4><br>  On December <a href="http://minsvyaz.ru/ru/documents/5487/">01</a> , <a href="http://minsvyaz.ru/ru/documents/5487/">2016</a> , the long-awaited <a href="http://minsvyaz.ru/ru/documents/5487/">order of the Ministry of Communications and Mass Media of Russia No. 607</a> was signed, regulating the provision of telecom operators with coordinates and other information about the caller in the 112 system.  The deadline was set for May 1, 2017. Operators implemented it fairly quickly due to the centralization of the service: each operator <div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">big five</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Beeline, MTS, MegaFon, Tele2, Rostelecom </div></div>  a single, rather than regional, platform responds to the whole country or to the macroregion, by analogy with the SMS service.  Systems-112 ( <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/340666/">each region has its own</a> ) matured longer.  In fact, even now not many subjects provided reception of such information from telecom operators.  We implemented it by December 2017.

      In short, the algorithm is as follows.  With the subscriber's call to 112 in the SIP header, the carrier ID is received, to which the system-112 then sends a request about the location of the caller.  The information system of the communication operator provides the system-112 coordinates, while indicating their error.  The geographic information subsystem 112 visualizes this on a map as a circle or a sector. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/hi/by/zc/hibyzciqdgphspngspsdn2gta-0.jpeg" alt="Typical sector"><br><br>  The operator 112 sees the approximate location and uses it in work.  In addition, he can, within a day, re-request the coordinates of this subscriber and receive them. <br><br>  And now the problems <br><br><h4>  1. The maximum permissible error is not defined. </h4><br>  The Ministry of Communications has defined a lot, but the maximum permissible error of determining the location of the user equipment when providing such data by the mobile operator is not limited.  This leads to the fact that the distance between the center of the area transferred by the operator to the intended subscriber‚Äôs location and its actual position reaches 3.5 km in the city and 20 km in the area.  Definitely, 3.5 km is an unacceptable error in the city, where base stations are located quite often. <br><br>  Presumably, such errors can be defined as 500 m for the city and 2 km outside.  At the same time, the European standard for service 112 since 2003 has determined the accuracy of determining 150 m in urban areas and 500 m in rural areas, and the American - up to 100 m in 80% of cases ( <a href="https://cyberleninka.ru/article/n/sravnitelnyy-analiz-otechestvennyh-i-zarubezhnyh-podhodov-k-opredeleniyu-mestopolozheniya-dlya-ekstrennyh-sluzhb">source</a> ). <br><br>  It should be borne in mind that the error transmitted by the operator should be considered in conjunction with the criterion "the proportion of correctly defined coordinates of the location."  Those.  if the subscriber did not hit, then this is a violation of the 1st criterion, and if the operator exceeded the permissible error, this is also a violation, but of the 2nd criterion. <br><br>  <i><b>Proposal:</b></i> Determine the maximum permissible error in determining the location of user equipment transmitted by the mobile operator. <br><br><h4>  2. The quality criteria of the provided coordinates are not defined. </h4><br>  And in general, the quality criteria provided by the communication operator are not defined.  This leaves them with a lot of loopholes.  For example, you can provide information through time or give at random.  Even taking into account the failure to comply with item 1 (above), the operators in the aggregate give the correct location in almost 50% of cases. <br><br>  <i><b>Proposal:</b></i> enter the following quality criteria for providing by a telecom operator information on the location of user equipment when a subscriber contacts the system-112: <br><br><ul><li>  The share of refusals to provide information from the total number of requests to the operator‚Äôs information system is not more than 10%; </li><li>  The subscriber‚Äôs share in the area transmitted by the operator is at least 80%. </li></ul><br><h4>  3. Accuracy is not high enough. </h4><br>  To provide 1 and 2 points, operators will have to revise the technologies used.  In paragraph 24 of the Order, which is annexed to the same <a href="http://minsvyaz.ru/ru/documents/5487/">order</a> , it is regulated that the location of the subscriber station is determined by the information system of the telecom operator with the accuracy technologically accessible to the telecom operator.  According to the results of operation in the city of Voronezh, there are doubts that operators use coordinate determination technology using two or more base stations.  On the contrary, there are suspicions that the definition of the subscriber's location area is carried out using statistical methods, when the area of ‚Äã‚Äãpeak operator traffic in a segment of a specific base station is issued for such an area. <br><br>  <i><b>Suggestion:</b></i> you can list technologies that are known to operators with indication of the territory of their primary use (regional center, sparsely populated areas), but perhaps accepting the criteria specified in paragraph 1 and paragraph 2 will ensure that this clause is automatically met. <br><br><h4>  4. Not accurate wording about 24 hours </h4><br>  In accordance with clause 27 of the Order, the Telecommunications Operator ensures the availability of information on the location of user equipment (terminal equipment) and additional information to provide upon request from CC-112 for <u>no more than</u> 24 hours from the moment a user calls the number 112.  In this case, if the operator provides data within 1 hour, then in fact he fulfills the requirement ‚Äúno more than 24 hours‚Äù.  In addition, it is not indicated what the relevance of the transmitted data is: at the time of the request or at the time of receiving the primary call. <br><br>  <i><b>Suggestion: the</b></i> telecom operator should ensure the transmission of the <u>current</u> location of the user equipment at the request of the system-112 strictly <u>within</u> 24 hours after the <u>last call of the</u> subscriber to the system-112 by calling or sending an SMS to the phone 112. <br><br><h4>  5. Coordinates are not transmitted during unavailable calls. </h4><br>  The order does not specify the requirements for the order of data on the location of user equipment that is not equipped with a SIM card.  And there are a lot of such calls.  As a result, operators do not provide data on the location of such equipment.  According to them, this is due to the lack of information in the information systems about subscriber devices without a SIM.  And the basic method of providing information to the system-112 is Pull - at the request of the system-112 to the carrier system. <br><br>  <i><b>Proposal:</b></i> Determine how operators provide data on the location of user equipment not equipped with a SIM card. <br><br><h4>  6. The procedure for using mobile push method is not clarified. </h4><br>  Paragraph 28 of the Procedure (annex to the <a href="http://minsvyaz.ru/ru/documents/5487/">order</a> ) provides for the transfer of information about the location of the subscriber by the Push method, when the coordinates are transmitted immediately with the call, but mobile operators do not do this.  According to them, the use of the Push method by mobile operators when transmitting information with the incoming call is technically impossible with the current communication system, since in most cases the operators have been interfacing with Rostelecom not via SIP. <br><br>  Why do we need it?  This would allow the transfer of coordinates with an unavailable call (see the previous paragraph). <br><br>  <i><b>Proposal:</b></i> Explain the procedure for applying p. 28 and other requirements for the transfer of information by the Push method to mobile operators. <br><br><h4>  8. Not using GPS and GLONASS technology. </h4><br>  The order does not regulate the use of GPS and GLONASS technologies in determining the location of the subscriber, while these technologies would significantly improve the quality of determining the location of the caller. <br><br>  <i><b>Proposal:</b></i> to include in the requirements for certification in the territory of the Russian Federation telephone sets equipped with GPS / GLONASS, automatic determination and sending of coordinates when calling 112. <br><br><h4>  9. SMS can not be sent from number 112 </h4><br>  The methodical recommendations in order and the rules of construction and operation of the telecommunications subsystem of the system-112 regulate the use of the emergency service call number and the ‚ÄúSystem-112‚Äù signature when sending an SMS from the system-112; 112  Now it is suggested to conduct a dialogue with the subscriber who addressed to the system-112: the subscriber receives an SMS from the ‚ÄúSystem-112‚Äù counterparty, and must respond to the ‚Äú112‚Äù counterparty.  This is not convenient, especially in an emergency situation for the subscriber.  A good practice in this regard can be the use of a single number ‚Äú900‚Äù by Sberbank. <br><br>  <i><b>Proposal:</b></i> Organize the use of a three-digit number ‚Äú112‚Äù for sending SMS from the 112 system, regulate the procedure for its provision by telecom operators for the regional operator of the 112 system <br><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4><br>  A letter with proposals was sent to the Ministry of Communications and Mass Media, we are waiting for an invitation to discuss.  This was also sent to the neighboring regions with a request to exchange information and correct / support.  While not received a response.  Maybe here a respected community will comment. <br><br>  Thanks to all! <br><br>  And in any incomprehensible situation, call 112! <br><br>  UPD 04/02/2018: Thanks for the advice and clarification!  It is highly likely to dwell on <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Mobile_Location">AML</a> / <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELS">ELS</a> , as it is not the most expensive and at the same time very effective way.
