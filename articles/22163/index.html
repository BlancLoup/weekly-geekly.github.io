  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Making quotes on sites</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Usually, when making up texts for the web, the design of quotes is not paid enough attention.  Trying to correct this unfortunate misunderstanding, we will touch upon two issues: the typographical design of quotes (in the part where errors are most often made during layout) and the implementation of this design in HTML code. <br><br>  We will also not touch upon the questions of checking the semantic accuracy of citations, the proper use of bills, abbreviations and additions - the ‚ÄúPublisher and Author Handbook‚Äù by A.E. Milchin and L. K. Cheltsova is waiting for all those interested. <br><br>  We hope that this record will be conveniently used as a guide to frequently encountered questions of the design of quotations.

    <a name="habracut"></a><h1>  Typographical typography </h1><h2>  Quotes </h2><br>  Quotations inside the text, typed in the same way as the main text, are enclosed in quotes.  If the quotation is highlighted in color, font size, another font, italic, or the quotation is in a separate graphically selected block of text, then the quotes are not placed.  Also quotes-epigraphs are not distinguished by quotes if they are not accompanied by non-quotational text. <br><br>  Quotes are put only at the beginning and end of the quotation, regardless of the size of the quotation and the number of paragraphs in it. <br><br>  Quotes are in quotes of the same pattern as used in the main text as the main ones - in the overwhelming number of cases these are quotes-Christmas trees "". <br><br>  If inside a quote there are words (phrases, phrases), in turn, enclosed in quotes, the latter should be of a different pattern than quotes that close and open the quotation (if external quotes are Christmas trees "", then internal quotes are ‚Äú‚Äû, ‚Äùand vice versa ).  For example: <i>Vasyl Pupkin declared in a recent interview: ‚ÄúPupstroytrest Company took the honorable six hundred and twelfth place in the rating of construction companies in Zaporizhia‚Äù.</i> <br><br>  If the quotation contains quotation marks of the ‚Äúthird degree,‚Äù that is, inside quotational phrases, quotations are, in turn, words, quoted, as the latter, quotation marks of the second pattern are recommended, that is, paws.  An example from Milchin and Cheltsova: <i>M. M. Bakhtin wrote: ‚ÄúTrishatov tells a teenager about his love for music and develops the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãan opera in front of him:‚Äú Listen, do you like music?</i>  <i>I love terribly ... If I composed an opera, then, you know, I would take a plot from "Faust".</i>  <i>I love this topic very much. ‚Äù</i>  But in general, it is better to try to reorganize the design of the quote in such a way that such cases do not arise. <br><br><h2>  Punctuation after a quote at the end of a sentence </h2><br>  If the sentence ends with a quote, the dot is always put <em>after the</em> closing quote.  The point is not put in the following cases. <ol><li>  If there are ellipsis, exclamation mark or question mark before the closing quotes, and the quotation enclosed in quotes is an independent sentence (as a rule, all quotations are after the colon separating them from the words of the quoting person).  In this case, the punctuation mark is placed <em>inside quotes</em> .  An example from Milchin and Chelcova: <br>  <i>Pechorin wrote: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt remember a morning bluer and fresher!‚Äù</i> <br>  <i>Pechorin confessed: ‚ÄúI sometimes despise myself ...‚Äù</i> <br>  <i>Pechorin asks: "And why was the fate of throwing me into a peaceful circle of honest smugglers?"</i> </li><li>  The same, if a quotation ends with a separate sentence, the first sentence of which begins with a lowercase letter.  For example: <i>Pechorin reflects: ‚Äú... why was the fate of throwing me into the peaceful circle of honest smugglers?</i>  <i>Like a stone thrown into a smooth spring, I alarmed their calm ... "</i> </li><li>  If a quotation mark precedes the quotation marks with a question or exclamation mark, the quotation is not an independent sentence, and after the whole phrase with the quotation there should be a question or exclamation mark.  For example: <i>Lermontov exclaims in the preface that this is ‚Äúan old and pitiful joke!‚Äù</i> </li></ol>  We emphasize once again, in other cases a full stop is put at the end of the sentence, and it is put <em>after the</em> closing quotation mark. <br><br><h2>  Quote with words quoting inside </h2><br>  Despite the fact that there is a quotation inside the quotation, quotation marks are still put only once - at the beginning and at the end of the quotation.  It is <em>not necessary to</em> put a closing quote before quoting and again opening words after them. <br><br>  If there are no punctuation marks in the place of a quote break, or a break occurs at the place of a comma, a semicolon, a colon or a dash, then the quoting words are separated from both sides by a comma and a dash ", -" (do not forget that there must be an unbreakable space before the dash! ). <br><table><tbody><tr><td>  <strong>In source</strong> </td><td>  <strong>In the text with a quote</strong> </td></tr><tr><td>  I became incapable of noble impulses ... </td><td>  ‚ÄúI,‚Äù Pechorin admits, ‚Äúhave become incapable of noble impulses ...‚Äù </td></tr><tr><td>  ...

In addition, the inline element <code>cite</code> used to describe the source from which the quote was taken.  Please note that <code>cite</code> used solely and is necessary to indicate a link to the source, the quote itself inside the <code>cite</code> element is not included! <br><br>  <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/struct/text.html">According to the HTML 4.01 specification</a> , the <code>blockquote</code> and <code>q</code> elements can use the attributes <code>cite="‚Ä¶"</code> indicating the URL from which the quote was borrowed (not to be confused with a separate <code>cite</code> element), and <code>title="‚Ä¶"</code> , the contents of which will pop up as a hint when hover on quote by mouse. <br><br>  Unfortunately, browsers don't handle these HTML elements very well.  So, the attribute <code>cite="‚Ä¶"</code> not rendered by any browsers at all.  In order to circumvent this flaw, there is <a href="http://willcode4beer.com/tips.jsp%3Fset%3DblockquoteHover">a Paul Davis script</a> that displays a tooltip on a separate layer with a link specified in the <code>cite</code> attribute. <br><br>  The second global flaw associated with the withdrawal of inline quotes is connected (surprise, surprise!) With the Internet Explorer family of browsers.  Again, according to the specification, the author of the document should not type quotes when using the <code>q</code> element.  Quotes should be rendered by the browser, and in the case of the presence of nested quotes - also a different picture.  Okay, let's say Opera does not comply with the latter requirement, and the quotes in nested quotes are the same.  But IE to the seventh version inclusive does not render them at all! <br><br>  In addition, IE does not understand the CSS properties <code>quotes</code> , <code>before</code> , <code>after</code> and <code>content</code> , which, brute, completely buries the hopes of solving a problem with the help of semantically correct layout using CSS. <br><br>  This problem is solved in several ways: <ul><li>  using the proprietary CSS property <code>behavior</code> ( <a href="http://willcode4beer.com/tips.jsp%3Fset%3DfixIEQuotes">Paul Davis solution</a> ), which launches JavaScript, arranges quotes in IE, and the picture of nested quotes alternates; </li><li>  using conditional comments, simply executing JavaScript when the page loads (the <a href="http://juicystudio.com/article/fixing-ie-quotes.php">solution of Jez Lemon</a> from Juicy Studio), while the pattern of nested quotes is constant; </li><li>  or zeroing quotes in CSS using the <code>quotes</code> property and placing quotes in the text manually, but (attention!) outside the <code>q</code> element, so as not to violate the recommendations of the W3C ( <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/qtag">Stacy Cordoni's solution</a> on the A List Apart website). </li></ul>  The latter method seems to me the same deal with conscience as an attempt to find a way to get around the restrictions on Shabbat - a violation of the spirit while observing the letter of recommendations. <br><br>  Therefore, choosing the second method from the first two, we use the Jez Lemon script, which is slightly modified for the Russian language.  Yes, with javascript disabled, the IE user will be left without quotes, we take it as a necessary evil. <br><br><h1>  Our solution for quotes </h1>  So, in order to adequately create text with quotes, you need to download <a href="http://narod.ru/disk/4888366001/quotes.js.html">the quotes.js script</a> , and then connect it inside the <code>head</code> element using conditional comments: <br><br> <code>&lt;!--[if &lt; IE 7]&gt;</code> <br> <code>&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="quotes.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code> <br> <code>&lt;![endif]--&gt;</code> <br> <br>  In addition, for browsers that adequately render quotes, you need to specify the quotes for the Russian language in the CSS file.  Fortunately, in Russian typography, nested quotes have one image regardless of the nesting level (which is easy to implement in CSS without attracting additional classes), but we once again strongly recommend avoiding deep nesting quotes at the stage of writing the text. <br><br> <code>//   CSS-</code> <br> <code>//  -</code> <br> <code>q { quotes: "\00ab" "\00bb"; }</code> <br> <br> <code>//  -</code> <br> <code>qq { quotes: "\201e" "\201c"; }</code> <br> <br>  It is clear that, if necessary, this mechanism can be complicated in the case of alternating quotation patterns with deep nesting, by introducing classes, for example, <code>q.odd</code> and <code>q.even</code> and pointing the class with the hands directly during the layout of the quotation. <br><br>  Now we easily and semantically impose the following quotation: <i>‚ÄúThe success of the Zalgiris campaign,‚Äù said Vladimiraras Pupkins in an interview with Russia Today, is due not only to the choice of vendors of toothpaste, but also to what Mark Twain called ‚Äúleap beyond the door leading in‚Äù "".</i> <br><br> <code>&lt;q cite="http://russiatoday.com.org.uk.lv" title="    ¬´Russia Today¬ª"&gt;  ‚Äû‚Äú,&amp;nbsp;‚Äî    ‚ÄûRussia Today‚Äú &lt;cite&gt; &lt;/cite&gt;,&amp;nbsp;‚Äî       ,   ,  &lt;cite&gt; &lt;/cite&gt;  &lt;q title="    "&gt;  ,  &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/q&gt;. <br></code> <br>  Most gusto is that the <code>title="‚Ä¶"</code> attributes for nested tags are processed by browsers correctly. <br><br>  Writing an example for correctly sharing nested <code>blockquote</code> , <code>q</code> and <code>cite</code> elements is left to the reader as homework.  :) <br><br>  <b>Update:</b> Amendment from <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/besisland/" class="user_link">besisland</a> - of course, to set the quotes in CSS, you do not need to describe nested styles, the standard functionality of the <code>quotes</code> property is enough: <code>q {quotes: "\00ab" "\00bb" "\201e" "\201c";}</code> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/22163/">https://habr.com/ru/post/22163/</a></p>
