But, in the best traditions, he postponed his writing day after day.  During this time, I managed to read more than 300.000 news in the RSS reader, view and send about a thousand tweets, like a couple of thousand photos, watch a few dozen films, finish three series and curse the 9th series of the third season of the Game of Thrones (yes, this It was a long time ago.  In general, I was very, very busy. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ea1/20e/ca6/ea120eca6ebf3dfe646140a30e34f123.jpg"><br><br>  To describe such a state in psychology, there is a term ‚Äúprocrastination‚Äù familiar to any Habrazhitel.  We are well aware that it would be good, damn it, to finally work, but then we fall down on some unnecessary trifle - for example, arrange the bags with paper napkins, accumulated in the bottom drawer, alphabetically.

      Every week on any respected IT-resource articles appear on how to overcome procrastination.  It is called the scourge of the 21st century and the authors of texts talk long and beautifully on the topic of intrinsic motivation.  I must say, these are great articles.  They like many and well commented.  I myself wrote about ten comments under them, just not to write this text.  So, personally, all these psychological things do not affect me.  Therefore, I picked up a few concepts that could motivate well. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>1. Clock erasing the to-do list with an arrow</b> <br><br>  A group of Chinese designers with unpronounceable last names proposed the concept of the Clock <a href="http://www.yankodesign.com/2013/03/26/delete-my-schedule/">Delete Clock</a> .  The watch dial serves as a marker board, where the owner writes a to-do list in front of each hour.  Over time, the big clock-sponge moves and erases the records.  Fearing that the case will be erased before execution and not having the opportunity to postpone or transfer any tasks, the employee acts more quickly.  At least she tries. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3d9/2a3/c39/3d92a3c3923d5911e1482bfc9b2b946a.jpg"><br><br>  <b>2. Wall buttons with timer</b> <br><br>  Korean Designer Concept Kim Sung Min (Kim Sung Min) <a href="http://www.computerra.ru/51147/">It's the</a> Best <a href="http://www.computerra.ru/51147/">Time To Read Me</a> won the Red Dot Design Award in the ‚ÄúBest Concept‚Äù section.  The idea is in the backlit stickers, lit on a timer.  Tiny LEDs and a timer with a primitive plant are built into the unusual buttons - when the reminder time comes, a light bulb lights up above the corresponding sticker.  The advantage of this method is visibility and simplicity, unlike, for example, from electronic reminders of a smartphone.  It is assumed that the bright illuminated sticker will not get lost among a heap of pop-up messages, letters, and the like, that is, everything that the phone and computer constantly distracts us. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/97d/0a3/ac2/97d0a3ac20de96e79249da81a9279ddc.jpg"><br><br>  <b>3. Push-button calendar (the one from KDPV)</b> <br><br>  In continuation of the theme with the calendar - Japanese designer Rehoe Yusuki <a href="http://www.ry-to-job.com/ry-to-job/e-contex/job/06%2520pushpin%2520calender.html">invented the</a> Pushpin Calendar, a calendar button consisting of dated pens.  The designer suggests not to add important events or memorable dates to the calendars, but to create your own calendar on the wall.  Yes, with this calendar you will not know how many Saturdays fall next month, or that Bastille Day successfully falls on Friday.  But you will always know how much the son brought a drawing from the kindergarten.  And, you can also distribute tasks on a board that are dated by a specific number, and shoot them as you progress. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ea1/20e/ca6/ea120eca6ebf3dfe646140a30e34f123.jpg"><br><br>  <b>4. Calendar in the form of matches</b> <br><br>  Ukrainian Designer <a href="http://www.gstudio.com.ua/">Yurko Gutsulyak</a> created another calendar Energy calendar, where every day is made in the form of a match.  Having lived the day, the user tears off a match and burns it - at this moment, as conceived by the author, he comes to realize the irrevocability of time, and therefore the desire to use it, time, more effectively.  Given what is happening now in Kiev, the days with matches begin to acquire a completely different meaning. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1e9/978/e6c/1e9978e6c87882c172d04bf0815aa6ee.jpg"><br><br>  <b>5. Calendar in the form of garbage bags</b> <br><br>  The same author has another similar idea - to produce calendars in the form of garbage bags.  The motivation is the same - throwing the next day in the trash, willy-nilly, you begin to appreciate the time. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3be/1cc/866/3be1cc8662bf0198030b0a88fdc1f2df.jpg"><br><br>  <b>6. DIA calendar puzzle</b> <br><br>  Portuguese designer Gonzalo Kampos <a href="http://www.yankodesign.com/2012/09/11/putting-the-year-together/">proposed the</a> concept of a wall calendar in the form of a puzzle, which is assembled by the user during the year from pieces of dark (if the day is unsuccessful) and light (if the day is successful) colors.  As days go by, an infographic of weeks and months emerges, which helps a person to approach time more consciously. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9e3/b1d/1c6/9e3b1d1c6f16ef5bb56bab400bae94b5.jpg"><br><br>  The same idea is the basis of <a href="http://cargocollective.com/petterhanberger/Calendar-T-shirt">the T-shirt calendar</a> proposed by a student at the Stockholm College of Design, Pepper Hanberger. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/761/088/928/7610889280ea5204713018309e845c58.jpg"><br><br>  Only in this case, the calendar is hung not on the wall, but on itself.  True, this very much raises the problem of washing.  Since an unpleasant smell can make any day black. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/211725/">https://habr.com/ru/post/211725/</a></p>
