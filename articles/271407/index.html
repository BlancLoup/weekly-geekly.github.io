  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Analyze resumes with HeadHunter. Who earns how much and in which industries he works</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Recently, <a href="http://petamelon.ru/">the Petamelon hackathon came into</a> our hands with a dataset with ~ 6,000,000 CVs from NN.  Naturally, there were no personal data and contacts, but there were many other interesting things: the expected salary, age, gender, approximate address, education and industries in which a person is looking for work.  It was decided to try to use this data <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/268839/">in our project about the choice of schools</a> .  The idea was to determine in which industries school graduates work and how much they earn.  But I, of course, could not resist and built a bunch of other useless, but cool tables and graphs. <br><br>  The distribution of resumes by age has an interesting form and seems to be divided into two parts: before graduation and after: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8fb/4b3/f98/8fb4b3f98bd54d0e924a17ed8a32c7ab"><br><br>  In Moscow, with age, the expected salary goes to a plateau of ~ 50,000 rubles: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0f5/61c/296/0f561c296dc84114bf14710e42fb8537"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In the data, instead of the floor, there were zeros and ones.  The unit was slightly larger.  Probably these are girls, I thought: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dae/8e5/c8f/dae8e5c8fea54d508343d8951e198019">
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      And when I looked at the distribution of the sexes by industry, there was no doubt: 1 - just girls. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b97/e6b/537/b97e6b537e284fd3b1a09d952e927249"><br><br>  Could not resist and checked who has more salary expectations in Moscow.  In women, this is naturally explained by the fact that the distribution by industry differs: salaries are lower in hospitals and schools. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/89e/86e/18e/89e86e18effd49f3b8a3cbce3b29caf1"><br><br>  In addition to resumes, we also had vacancies, so it was interesting to compare supply and demand.  In general, everything is logical: the interns are more than necessary;  specialists in IT, marketing and banking are not enough: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c91/8f1/8df/c918f18dfa75429ba56376aa890e274d"><br><br>  To make it clearer who is in which categories, here is the handbook: <ul><li>  Sales -

Surprisingly, the highest expectations are not in Moscow, but in the Far East.  Why so, who knows? <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/019/e8a/05e/019e8a05ee6240ee8dbc9224d04c812b"><br><br>  Distortions in industries are sometimes expected and sometimes strange: <ul><li>  In the Moscow region from somewhere skewed into transport; </li><li>  In Voronezh - in insurance; </li><li>  In the Krasnodar region there is a bias in tourism, but in the Crimea there; </li><li>  In Moscow and St. Petersburg, there is less ‚Äúraw material extraction‚Äù at the expense of other areas. </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d25/69b/f4f/d2569bf4f9c148779c1abbaea764a4b2"><br><br>  Then the same thing was done for Moscow universities.  For some reason, I didn‚Äôt see almost any signal on the expected salary, for all universities the result is approximately the same: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2ec/05b/794/2ec05b7949e746a08031263c6921cc3c"><br><br>  And according to the specialties the expected results were obtained.  Graduates of technical universities want to work as programmers and engineers, I can‚Äôt say anything about the other universities.  If your university is in the picture, see if it‚Äôs a normal result or not. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4a0/9d3/80a/4a09d380a154401f926f10f61f7ddfcb"><br><br>  For almost all Moscow schools, <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/270675/">we namainili from VC in which universities their graduates enter</a> .  Therefore, knowing the distribution of industries for universities, we can estimate the distribution of industries for schools.  If your school is in the picture, please validate the result: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/849/d69/ee5/849d69ee57534c91a74b4f89f822a904"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/271407/">https://habr.com/ru/post/271407/</a></p>
