Most recently, the film <a href="http://geektimes.ru/search/%3Fq%3D%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580">Interstellar</a> was released.  1], which reminded me that I was also in 2008.  led the study of the concept of time travel, in the framework of Einstein's theory of relativity. <br><br>  Initially, the task was to determine the conditions for creating a negative speed, but in the end I got a new theory.  This publication is written in simple and understandable language, free from unnecessary scientific and complex formulas. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In my free time I talk to the press, here is one of the answers:

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5ad/e44/8e0/5ade448e0fc24aa7b515f8d501899620.jpg"><br>  <b>Theory</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2e9/e63/e2c/2e9e63e2caa843f2a79d9f57b20ccb76.jpg"><br><br>  In <abbr title="Special theory of relativity">STO</abbr> , time is the <abbr title="Special theory of relativity">driving</abbr> parameter, and why not set the speed as the driving parameter that needs to be communicated so that time becomes a negative value and the body falls into the past? <br><br>  Then you need to know under what conditions <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a5e/746/899/a5e7468990ca4a058c37d1d84d2715ce.jpg">  [f.2] Let's substitute in the first formula [f.1] the previous equality [f.2] and get: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/98e/07e/fc0/98e07efc029743c0bb4ac7666fdcfc27.jpg"><br><br>  And we get a very interesting formula: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ede/626/510/ede62651001c40a3b434e1624b824dc0.jpg">  [f.3] <br><br>  We get a new axis j, the presence of which tells us that the condition [f.2] will be fulfilled when the body transitions to five-dimensional space, where the fourth axis of space is time, and the fifth is just j. <br><br>  In this case, the body will be simultaneously in two points of space, at the same time, since + -j. <br><br>  And this means that the paradoxes of time travel are solved - violations of cause-effect relationships, for example, the paradox is the so-called ‚Äúparadox of the killed grandfather‚Äù: if the grandson returns to the past and kills his own grandfather, his birth will be impossible;  but if he is not born, no one will kill the grandfather, and his birth will be possible [et.  2]. <br><br>  Since the body is located at two points at the same time, the ‚ÄúYes / No‚Äù logical conditions are simultaneous and the grandfather is both alive and dead, like his grandson.  Well, the opportunity to get closer to the practical application of this theory is given by the speed formula derived from [f.3]: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/347/689/d99/347689d9997a436e812b10bba903ae52.jpg">  [f.4] <br><br>  It follows from the formula that 2 conditions must be met: <br><br>  1. The body should move at a speed slightly close to the speed of light. <br>  2. The body should move along the j axis. <br><br>  The first condition is easily fulfilled and even has a clear definition of how Superluminal motion [its true.  3].  According to the Hubble law, distant galaxies located at a distance greater than c / H (where H is the Hubble constant, equal to 67.80 ¬± 0.77 (km / s) / Mpc), move away from each other at a speed exceeding the speed of light. <br><br>  I will also provide links to publications about the work of scientists who have already reached a speed greater than the speed of light [test.  4, 5, 6]. <br><br>  The second condition is performed on the basis of the work of the Australian group of scientists, which included astrophysicist Tamara Davis.  The speed of light can vary depending on the time or distance from the earth by approximately 3.7 million parsecs [itt.  7].  Moving away from the earth at a certain distance, and moving at a speed greater than the speed of light, we can easily move to the j axis.  And this brings us closer to the practical application of my theory. <br><br>  Accordingly, finding the transition point in the j axis and learning to move at a speed greater than the speed of light, we will get the opportunity to travel in time. <br><br>  Touching on other theories of superluminal motion, such as <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259A%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0">Krotovaya Nora</a> , <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A2%25D1%2580%25D1%2583%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B0_%25D0%259A%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D1%2581%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0">Trub Krasnikov</a> , <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D1%2583%25D0%25B7%25D1%258B%25D1%2580%25D1%258C_%25D0%2590%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25BA%25D1%2583%25D0%25B1%25D1%258C%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5">Bubble Alcubjerre,</a> we can assume that my theory copies their ideas, however, none of them have the concept of being in one place at the same time, which makes it more logical to fit into C. T.O.  and continue this theory without violating the laws described in it. <br><br>  Summarizing, we can conclude that humanity is as close as possible to time travel. <br><br>  <b>Practical application of the theory</b> <br><br>  This theory proves the possibility of time travel, which gives a huge potential for all of world science.
