What many are waiting for when PayPal comes here, and the rudiments of the 90s like WebMoney will finally die.  It would seem that in a sufficient number of smart books it is written that the main thing in any business is communication with the client, that a company that does not provide the proper level of service is doomed to failure.  He tried very hard to write more softly, but, apparently, it did not work out.  So, get acquainted: arbitration Webmoney.  Paid, by the way, service. <br><br>  Frankly, I wanted to write this habratopik long ago.  Based on the cycle of stories <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/yandex/74263/">"How to take my money from the Yandex wallet</a> . <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/yandex/74263/">"</a>  All waited for the logical conclusion of the story.  I waited for exactly 3 months and 14 days, this is exactly the time that WebMoney arbitrage understands and tries to execute the decision on the claim filed by me.  At first, I just wanted to devote this topic to comparing the speed of Yandex.Money and WebMoney technical support, but the situation went beyond all imaginable limits of reasonable.  So, first things first. <a name="habracut"></a>

      In general, a simple story happened to me: on October 13, 2009, I paid for a certain service worth 1000 rubles through the Yandex.Money payment system.  First, the seller came up with additional conditions for the transaction and demanded additional payments, then he disappeared, then he appeared again and openly declared that he would not return the money and would not fulfill his obligations.  In short, the usual kidalovo.  On this occasion, a letter was sent to Yandex.Money technical support (Ticket # 2009101533003953, for the protocol) with a message about fraud.  2 days of quite lively correspondence, and I get the answer from Yandex: <br><blockquote>  &lt;...&gt; We received information that the money about which you applied to the security service of PS Yandex.Money LLC was completely or partially blocked on the account R110522500757 of the WebMoney payment system. <br><br>  For a refund, you should immediately contact the arbitration service of the Webmoney Transfer system at arbitrage@webmoney.ru &lt;...&gt; </blockquote><br>  Wow.  The caller himself made efforts to search for my funds withdrawn to another payment system through the exchanger, probably contacted the exchanger to clarify the beneficiary's account, contacted this payment system, and the stolen money eventually froze.  To say that I was surprised - to say nothing.  Let's take a look at how promptly Yandex employees worked (‚àÜt is the time elapsed since the last response of the caliper): <br><table><tbody><tr><th>  date </th><th>  Where </th><th>  The essence of the letter </th><th>  ‚àÜt </th></tr><tr><td>  10/15/2009 4:24 PM </td><td>  in Yandex </td><td>  Fraud Report </td><td>  - </td></tr><tr><td>  10/15/2009 4:25 pm </td><td>  from Yandex </td><td>  Robot answer about creating a ticket </td><td>  1 minute. </td></tr><tr><td>  10/15/2009 4:33 pm </td><td>  from Yandex </td><td>  Please describe the situation in detail. </td><td>  9 min </td></tr><tr><td>  10/16/2009 1:17 AM </td><td>  in Yandex </td><td>  Sent a detailed description, correspondence log </td><td>  - </td></tr><tr><td>  10/16/2009 2:42 </td><td>  from Yandex </td><td>  "Our experts are working on your problem" </td><td>  1 h. 25 min. </td></tr><tr><td>  10/16/2009 11:09 </td><td>  from Yandex </td><td>  Payment could not be withdrawn, but they promise to try <br>  find money </td><td>  8 h. 27 min. </td></tr><tr><td>  10/16/2009 2:33 pm </td><td>  from Yandex </td><td>  Money was found and blocked on the WebMoney account </td><td>  3 hours 24 minutes </td></tr></tbody></table>  The result: the problem was solved without any extra reminders, the tech support worked even at night, the customer is satisfied, the money could be found on the account of another payment system.  Things are easy: to issue a personal certificate WebMoney (without it do not accept lawsuits) and file a claim to arbitration, which I did.  Further correspondence was carried out exclusively through the WebMoney arbitration service (the claim numbers are 7238 and 7284, for the record).  For both claims, fees were paid to the system (7 and 3 and a half WMZ, respectively), for some reason, Yandex.Money disassembled such cases for free.  Well, once paid, I have the right to rely on quality service.  What came of it? <br><table><tbody><tr><th>  date </th><th>  Where </th><th>  The essence of the message </th><th>  ‚àÜt </th></tr><tr><td>  10/19/2009 3:07 PM </td><td>  in WM </td><td>  Lawsuit filed # 7238 filed to arbitration </td><td>  - </td></tr><tr><td>  10/24/2009 2:19 PM </td><td>  in WM </td><td>  I am interested in when to wait for an answer </td><td>  - </td></tr><tr><td>  10.26.2009 17:22 </td><td>  from WM </td><td>  The claim is rejected, its type must be changed and resubmitted </td><td>  7 days, 2 hours </td></tr><tr><td>  10.26.2009 20:18 </td><td>  in WM </td><td>  Lawsuit filed # 7284 filed to arbitration </td><td>  - </td></tr><tr><td>  10/27/2009 6:52 PM </td><td>  from WM </td><td>  Hidden message for arbitrators </td><td>  22 h. 34 min. </td></tr><tr><td>  10/27/2009 6:58 PM </td><td>  from WM </td><td>  Hidden message for arbitrators </td><td>  6 min </td></tr><tr><td>  10/27/2009 6:58 PM </td><td>  from WM </td><td>  Please respond to the trial. </td><td>  &lt;1 min </td></tr><tr><td>  11/06/2009 12:43 </td><td>  in WM </td><td>  Politely interested in when to wait for an answer </td><td>  - </td></tr><tr><td>  11.11.2009 09:09 </td><td>  in WM </td><td>  I am interested in when to wait for an answer </td><td>  - </td></tr><tr><td>  11/24/2009 5:05 pm </td><td>  in WM </td><td>  I wonder if they will decide anything before the New Year <br>  (in vain I was joking) </td><td>  - </td></tr><tr><td>  12/01/2009 7:14 PM </td><td>  from WM </td><td>  Arbitrators vote: 2 for, 0 against </td><td>  35 days, 1 hour </td></tr><tr><td>  11.12.2009 15:00 </td><td>  in WM </td><td>  I am interested in when to wait for the execution of the decision </td><td>  - </td></tr><tr><td>  01/13/2010 8:47 PM </td><td>  in WM </td><td>  Again interested </td><td>  - </td></tr><tr><td>  01/14/2010 3:20 PM </td><td>  from WM </td><td>  The application for the implementation of the decision filed in the center of certification </td><td>  43 days, 20 hours </td></tr></tbody></table><br>  It has now been almost a month, as I must return the money.  Or 3 and a half months from the beginning of the proceedings.  The lawsuit is closed, I no longer have a place to remind of my existence to WebMoney employees.  I think it makes no sense to write that this is disgusting (and even for my money), and so on.  One thing comforts me: I am firmly convinced that according to all the laws of the market, companies with such employees, with such methods of work, with the absence of at least a minimum level of respect for customers, have only a very short time to live.  The sooner it ceases to exist, the better it will be.  This is a natural process.  Thanks to the Yandex staff for the prompt trial, it‚Äôs a pity that it was almost impossible to get the money back thanks to WebMoney.  It is interesting to hear your opinions in the comments. <br><br>  <b>Update:</b> February 9, 2009 at 1:24 pm (26 days after the last news from WebMoney) I received the following email: <blockquote>  Hello.  <b>We are sending you the</b> key <b>file</b> from WMID # 30967230 **** Download the latest version of WebMoney Keeper Classic from <a href="http://www.webmoney.ru/">www.webmoney.ru</a> or make sure that you already have the latest version of WebMoney Keeper Classic.  Instructions on how to log in to WebMoney Keeper Classic are on the <a href="http://link.wmtransfer.com/M">link.wmtransfer.com/M</a> page <a href="http://link.wmtransfer.com/M">.</a> Regards, WebMoney Transfer Team. </blockquote>  I really liked the wording ‚Äúwe will resend‚Äù.  After another 2 letters from me, they ‚Äúsent it again‚Äù and forgotten the password from the respondent's WMID first, this time answering with much greater speed.  It was not possible to return all the money, but more than a third of the amount of the pair in the account of the defendant was found.  And thanks for that. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/83532/">https://habr.com/ru/post/83532/</a></p>
