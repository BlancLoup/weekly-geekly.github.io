  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The first days in the development team - as it happens with us</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><p>  When you are just going to enter a new job, you want to imagine in detail what is waiting for you.  In this post I will tell you how the first working day and the first weeks in our team are usually built, and also mention a few myths about Avito. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/kp/wk/bp/kpwkbpzcebjj38myhc_m59huzum.png"></p><a name="habracut"></a><br><h1 id="pervyy-den">  First day </h1><br><p>  On the first working day, newcomers arrive at the office by 10 am.  The important part, without which it is impossible - the signing of documents and reading internal regulations.  Then for new employees conduct safety training.  After the formalities are finished (I will not lie, this is not fast and takes about two hours), the more pleasant part of my acquaintance with the office begins.  All beginners are given a velcom set: </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pd/wt/ly/pdwtly09s_dvfvvn4zz0loyzl-4.jpeg"></p><br><p>  Inside - a notebook, branded bag-shopper, flask for drinks, sweets and slippers (to immediately feel at home).  After that, the recruiter, who worked with the employee, conducts a tour.  (If interested, a large photo report from the office can be viewed <a href="https://habr.com/company/avito/blog/335896/">here</a> ). </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cb0/9f7/e48/cb09f7e48d5f1efa96c6291b4490baba.jpg" alt="image"></p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9b4/a17/642/9b4a1764296ef10bb1a9c17baa418241.jpg" alt="image"></p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/773/c00/268/773c002688af6ee8b2474a185e071b9e.jpg" alt="image"></p><br><p>  At the workplace, a colleague sets up a laptop, creates the necessary accounts.  By the way, here are our main working tools: </p><br><ul><li>  corporate instant messenger - Slack; </li><li>  task trackers - Jira, Trello; </li><li>  knowledge base and documentation - Confluence; </li><li>  analytics - Tableau; </li><li>  VCS - Git (Bitbucket Server); </li><li>  CI - TeamCity. </li></ul><br><p>  (You can learn more about the processes and standards in the development team in our <a href="http://bit.ly/2SkNjQU">playbook on GitHub</a> ). </p><br><p>  In the first days of work, a novice is assigned a mentor from a team - as a rule, it is one of the senior developers.  Mentor answers all questions related to work, tools and processes.  In general, you can count on the support of the whole team: without a company for lunch (if you need one), they will not leave either.  For other hobbies there are also accomplices - my colleagues play mafia, football, marathons, play music ... </p><br><h1 id="pervye-nedeli">  First weeks </h1><br><p>  On the first day of work, a novice is sent a letter with materials on Avito's history, about how the life and processes in the company are organized.  In the first week, there is a meeting with a colleague from HR who can answer additional questions - for example, about LCA, training.  And about all that is important and interesting. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wf/3j/qc/wf3jqchdlujwdrxnfsukkxs6thm.jpeg"></p><br><p>  During the first two weeks, the newcomer gets a welcome training on the business and culture of Avito.  On it are colleagues from the departments of product, design and HR.  They tell about the structure of business, about how we measure the effectiveness of our work and what values ‚Äã‚Äãwe focus on in the decisions we make and the projects we implement. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/6a/jh/hd/6ajhhd2ux1seutry7sjpr8g964w.jpeg"></p><br><p>  After a month and a half of work, a welcome meeting for new colleagues is held by the Avito CEO. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/lz/o7/i1/lzo7i1zsjeokr01ovy-ct5dnsv0.jpeg"></p><br><h1 id="ispytatelnyy-srok">  Probation </h1><br><p>  As long as the trial period lasts, colleagues try to help the newcomer.  About once every two weeks (more / less often - depending on the team), the manager holds personal meetings.  On them you discuss current successes and failures, tasks for the sprint and quarter and general directions of professional development. </p><br><p>  As a rule, the beginner knows about the results of the probationary period in advance, so no nerves.  In some cases, the criteria for its passage are discussed in advance.  For example: </p><br><ul><li>  to conduct at least one interview in the algorithmic section, </li><li>  make some useful commits to the team repository with the Go service, </li><li>  go through a personal <a href="https://habr.com/company/avito/blog/353216/">Performance Review process</a> and get a rating of no less than ‚Äúmeets expectations‚Äù. </li></ul><br><p>  In general, my colleagues try to minimize nervousness and give all the answers in advance. </p><br><h1 id="vpechatleniya-kolleg-pryamaya-rech">  Impressions of colleagues.  Direct speech </h1><br><p>  I asked my colleagues to share their impressions of the first days of work and talk about what they were wrong about, until I met Avito personally. </p><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Disclaimer</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><p>  Describing the general process of interviewing is an impossible task for one post, just as it is impossible to give an average impression of the first days of work, therefore here there are only special cases, thoughts, emotions and stories. </p></div></div><br><h3 id="vspomnim-sobesedovaniya-kak-vsyo-proshlo-rekrutery-zabotlivy-zadaniya-norm">  Recall the interview.  How did everything go?  Are recruiters caring?  Tasks norms? </h3><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/32/ti/sd/32tisdbszmcp6ybwxuan3zvbd8w.png" alt="image" align="left"><br>  <strong>Ivan Lukyanov, head of unit development:</strong> </p><br><blockquote>  Interview, and especially the level of knowledge of the interviewee, was for me one of the decisive factors when making an offer.  I was looking for a place where I could learn a lot from my colleagues, and here the bar was very high. <br>  The recruiters were more than caring - at my request, they appointed an emergency final interview (I had one offer and I was in a hurry to get a second from Avito), and we ordered a second tour around the office.  All is well, in general. <br><br clear="left"></blockquote><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ms/r0/i3/msr0i3cjcwkp1n0vh4pup9izqy4.png" alt="image" align="left"><br>  <strong>Victor Shitkovsky, server side developer:</strong> </p><br><blockquote>  The interview is more than adequate.  During the technical part, I did not have to write a single line of code, I had enough conversations with future colleagues.  But here, apparently, the specifics affected: I am engaged in supporting and finishing the search infrastructure.  About round hatches did not ask. <br><br clear="left"></blockquote><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rk/hy/ug/rkhyug_tdxhx6ib4yzpptfxs-z0.png" alt="image" align="left"><br>  <strong>Daniil Volynkin, developer at the Data Platform:</strong> </p><br><blockquote>  At the interview with HR, there were no ‚Äúfavorite‚Äù brain teasers, but the technical one was rather wide in the regions and long. <br><br clear="left"></blockquote><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/yc/pl/px/ycplpxdtywo_2nyaaly4g6no1se.png" alt="image" align="left"><br>  <strong>Antonina Palchikova, Testing Specialist:</strong> </p><br><blockquote>  I remember that there were three meetings.  The first was with the head of testing - she answered about 90% of the questions, he also gave details about the working conditions and about the international <a href="https://www.istqb.org/">ISTQB</a> certification, which was the condition for passing a trial period in my specialty.  This motivated me very much to come to work in Avito. <br><br clear="left"></blockquote><br><h3 id="pervye-vpechatleniya-o-razrabotke-v-avito-ctek-podhody-chto-horosho-chto-ploho-chto-stranno">  First impressions about the development in Avito.

On the other hand, kubernetes, machine learning, google microservices, nosql storage and highload.

It's also fun to see the 2013 committees in Blame as the current development directors. <br><br clear="left"></blockquote><br><h3 id="vspomnite-vashi-vpechatleniya-o-pervyh-dnyah-raboty">  Remember your impressions of the first days of work </h3><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/32/ti/sd/32tisdbszmcp6ybwxuan3zvbd8w.png" alt="image" align="left"><br>  <strong>Ivan Lukyanov, head of unit development:</strong> </p><br><blockquote>  The first impression is the office.  I took the laptop and went to some far corner, every time a new one, in order to work in a new environment.  In general, he mastered it with pleasure.  In principle, I still continue to do so, except perhaps less often. <br>  The second impression is the team.  In the breaks between work, people discussed work, it was very motivating, plus it was a great contrast to past work. <br>  The third impression is, of course, burrows.  The burrows are beautiful. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/488/714/76c/48871476c091b8bc960c71a5421ecda6.jpg" alt="image"><br>  But seriously, when the first enthusiasm from the holes subsided, it became clear that the most important thing in Avito was the focus on the good and the meaning of what you were doing.  As a result, for example, in Avito you can already influence the product and processes from day one.  Your arguments will be heard, especially if you are ready to propose solutions. <br><br clear="left"></blockquote><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/x6/w5/vf/x6w5vflpjczz8dyvsdeb0mrdvbc.png" alt="image" align="left"><br>  <strong>Ekaterina Izaak, Testing Specialist:</strong> </p><br><blockquote>  A cool office, a bunch of different buns - food, even breakfast on Fridays, fruit, massage chair, free yoga - a fairy tale!

I actually got to the code only on the third day.  In general, I can say that the number of meetings and events related to employee training in Avito is on average much more than that of a developer in most other companies.  This is initially startling. <br><br clear="left"></blockquote><br><h3 id="adaptaciya-v-kollektive-welcome-vstrechi--kak-vam-eto-vsyo">  Adaptation in the team, welcome-meeting - how do you like it all? </h3><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/32/ti/sd/32tisdbszmcp6ybwxuan3zvbd8w.png" alt="image" align="left"><br>  <strong>Ivan Lukyanov, head of unit development:</strong> </p><br><blockquote>  Welcome-meetings with Vladimir Pravdiv made a great impression.
