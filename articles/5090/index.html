  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Smoke up! Mobile phone‚Ä¶</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Surprisingly, scientists have found a direct relationship between mobile communications and quitting smoking!  It turns out that mobile addiction replaces nicotine!  It's all about prestige.  After all, the owner of a cell phone increases the prestige in the eyes of other people.  Almost the same can be said about smoking people.  Most of all refusals of smoking in favor of mobile phones occur among young people.  Perhaps in the near future, mankind will live with perfectly healthy lungs precisely because of mobile communication!  Honestly, I do not really believe it.  There are skeptical opinions about this study.  Firstly, the powerful anti-smoking propaganda was not taken into account, which is now pouring into our eyes and already from the media.  Secondly, many countries cultivate a healthy lifestyle among the population.  That is, numerous bans on smoking in public places are introduced, smokers are forced out of society, as it were.  Smoking becomes the lot of marginalized groups, most often - immigrants.  This is unlikely to ever overtake the owners of mobile phones. <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/bae/c32/3d4/baec323d4c477f8c09107a9a7af4b982.jpg" width="300" height="186" alt="Cigars and Telephones" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right"><br><br>  In the past year alone, the number of cellular subscribers in Belarus alone has almost doubled.  Can you imagine if people in our country began to quit smoking at the same pace?  Yes, the operators could fit the Nobel Prize in the field of medicine to award! <br><br>  Who do we have in most cases, happy owners of cellular?  For example, employees of companies whose expenses on mobile communications are paid by the organization so that they are always available.  Or students who have a mobile phone - a gift from their parents, again to control their beloved offspring.  Do you understand what I am doing?  We often have a mobile phone - this is a restriction of personal freedom, this is a significant difference from Europe.  But smoking for our country (yes for the whole of the former USSR) is a symbol of liberation and freedom.  We do not have those negative factors (I listed them for Europe above) that can create a negative image of a smoker.  In addition, only recently we have become available to the elite varieties of tobacco, which can really create an unusual image for the smoker, and he suddenly offered to change his favorite smoke for some calling trinket.

      Try to answer the following question: "What kind of communication is better - a cigarette or a mobile phone?" Do not rush to answer.  I, although I do not smoke, tend to the fact that all the same - a cigarette.  How many people meet or even meet in this way - the lady with a cigarette is looking for a lighter in her purse, and a gallant man brings her his.  By the way, according to the rules of etiquette, any man should have a lighter with him, even if he does not smoke!  And how many interesting things you can discuss with your friends, running into the corridor to smoke, while any tariff of the cellular operator will make you painfully count every second.  Any pedestrians who smoke will treat you to a sigret, but very few will give you a call. <br><br>  So scientists, of course, are great, but cell phones can never beat a tobacco addiction.  Not on that attacked. <br><br>  Alexey Khaletsky <br>  <a href="http://crazyhamster.livejournal.com/166431.html">crazyhamster.livejournal.com/166431.html</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/5090/">https://habr.com/ru/post/5090/</a></p>
