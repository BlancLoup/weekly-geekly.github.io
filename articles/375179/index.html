This reactor causes extremely controversial opinions, and many treat it as a fraud, which does not deserve serious consideration and generally contradicts the basic laws of nuclear physics.  Nevertheless, all new evidence is emerging that the reactor is indeed working.  And now a working reactor from Russia ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  But first, a little bit of history.  I first heard about Andrea Rossi and his reactor in January 2011, when he conducted the first open demonstration of his device (E-Cat from the English energy catalyzer) at the University of Bologna.  Since then, I follow this topic.  Andrea Rossi did not disclose the details of the internal structure of the reactor, since it is a commercial secret.  Currently, all rights to this device belong to the American company Industrial Heat, where Russia heads all research and development activities in relation to the reactor. <br><br>  There are low-temperature (E-Cat) and high-temperature (Hot Cat) versions of the reactor.  The first for temperatures of about 100-200 ¬∞ C, the second for temperatures of about 800-1400 ¬∞ C.  Currently, the company has sold a 1 MW low-temperature reactor to an unnamed customer for commercial use and, in particular, Industrial Heat is testing and debugging at this reactor in order to begin full-scale industrial production of such energy blocks.  As Andrea Rossi says, the reactor operates mainly due to the reaction between nickel and hydrogen, during which the transmutation of nickel isotopes occurs with the release of a large amount of heat.  Those.  some nickel isotopes are transferred to other isotopes.  Nevertheless, a number of independent tests were carried out, the most informative of which was the test of the high-temperature version of the reactor in the Swiss city of Lugano.  This test has already been written <a href="http://geektimes.ru/post/239971/">here</a> .

      On December 27, an article on the <a href="http://www.e-catworld.com/2014/12/27/lugano-confirmed-replication-report-published-of-hot-cat-device-by-russian-researcher-alexander-g-parkhomov/">independent reproduction of the Rossi reactor in Russia</a> was published on the E-Cat World website.  The same article contains a link to the report <a href="https://docviewer.yandex.com/%3Furl%3Dya-disk-public%253A%252F%252FejFRuMB3GiCF6ZXZHI9lIxg2OeCo5GTI6HuLUo5jb5Y%253D%26name%3D%25D0%2590%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%2520%25D0%25A0%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8.pdf%26c%3D549ef80fbba1">‚ÄúResearch of an analogue of high-temperature heat generator Rossi‚Äù by</a> physicist <a href="http://www.researchgate.net/profile/A_Parkhomov/info">Aleksandr Georgievich Parkhomov</a> .  The report was prepared for the All-Russian Physical Seminar "Cold Nuclear Synthesis and Ball Lightning", which was held on September 25, 2014 at the Russian University of Peoples Friendship. <br><br>  In the report, the author presented his version of the Rossi reactor, data on its internal structure and tests carried out.  The main conclusion: the reactor really emits more energy than it consumes.  The ratio of heat released to energy consumed was 2.58.  Moreover, for about 8 minutes, the reactor worked without any input power supply, after the supply wire had burned out, producing about a kilowatt of thermal output power. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/fd4/2e0/0fd/fd42e00fdc5f5e4cf950671460b42fbd.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  SUPPLEMENT (1/15/15) <br><br>  On January 14, 2015, the following <a href="http://www.proatom.ru/modules.php%3Ffile%3Darticle%26name%3DNews%26sid%3D5779">message</a> was published on the website <a href="http://www.proatom.ru/">www.proatom.ru</a> : <br><blockquote>  <b>VNIAES invites LENR opponents and stuntmen to the seminar</b> <br><br>  January 27, 2015, Tuesday, at 14-00, in VNIIAES (Fergana, 25) in the room.  614 a SEMINAR will take place: "The study of low-energy nuclear reactions is a new direction in science."

I personally could not attend, but if you want you can see a lot on the Internet.  It was very interesting to me.  Aleksandr Georgievich himself asks to use as official data from the site of the <a href="http://lenr.seplm.ru/">CTF and BL</a> .  So I provide links from this site. <br><br>  <a href="https://yadi.sk/i/8f_JV8ygeMQSc">An updated version of the report of Alexander Parkhomov</a> <br>  <a href="http://vimeo.com/118323825">Speech by Alexander Parkhomov at the seminar in the RUDN University 01/29/15</a> <br><br>  Main conclusions: <br><ul><li>  Work continues, new tests are being conducted, the effect of the release of excess heat is repeated. </li><li>  A series of calibration tests were carried out with electrical heaters and a reactor without fuel.  In this case, as expected, the heat output is equal to the electrical power input. </li><li>  The main problem at the moment is the local overheating of the reactor, which is why the heating coil burns out and even the reactor itself can burn through (although the melting point of corundum ceramics from which it is made is over 2000C).  This does not allow for sufficiently long-term tests. </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b2c/ac1/ad6/b2cac1ad6e620d630ad67c9b3cc68b5c.png" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d77/7cd/447/d777cd447672309f418891811918aefe.png" alt="image"><br><br>  SUPPLEMENT # 4 (03/20/2015) <br><br>  The following message appeared on the site of <a href="http://lenr.seplm.ru/novosti/ag-parkhomovu-udalos-sdelat-dlitelno-rabotayushchii-reaktor-s-2330-16-marta-temperatura-derzhitsya-do-sikh-por">CTIA and CMM</a> on March 19: <br><blockquote>  <b>A.G.</b>  <b>Parkhomov managed to make a long-running reactor with pressure measurement.</b>  <b>From 23:30 on March 16, the temperature is still high.</b>  <b>Photo reactor.</b> <br><br>  Finally, we managed to make a long-running reactor.  The temperature of 1200 ¬∞ C was reached at 23:30 March 16, after 12 hours of gradual heating, and still lasts.  Heater power 300 W, COP = 3. <br>  For the first time successfully managed to install a pressure gauge in the installation.  With slow heating, the maximum pressure of 5 bar was reached at 200 ¬∞ C, then the pressure decreased and became negative at a temperature of about 1000 ¬∞ C.  The strongest vacuum of about 0.5 bar was at a temperature of 1150 ¬∞ C. <br><br>  During long continuous work there is no possibility to pour water around the clock.  Therefore, we had to abandon the calorimetry used in previous experiments, based on measuring the mass of evaporated water.  The determination of the thermal coefficient in this experiment is carried out by comparing the power consumed by the electric heater with and without the fuel mixture.  Without fuel, the temperature of 1200 ¬∞ C is reached at a power of about 1070 watts.  In the presence of fuel (630 mg of nickel + 60 mg of lithium aluminum hydride), this temperature is reached at a power of about 330 watts.  Thus, the reactor produces about 700 watts of excess power (COP ~ 3.2).  (Explanation of A.G. Parkhomov, a more accurate value of the COP requires a more detailed calculation) <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d23/8ab/c3a/d238abc3ad85456cab0c2990322e3dc9.jpg"><br></blockquote><br>  My congratulations! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/375179/">https://habr.com/ru/post/375179/</a></p>
