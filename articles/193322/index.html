Interview with Eric Hodel</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The 12th Ruby-developers conference RailsClub'Moscow 2013 is just around the corner.  A little more than two weeks left before the conference.  By the way, tickets for 6500 are already running out.  We advise not to postpone the <a href="http://railsclub.timepad.ru/event/76008/%3Futm_refcode%3D95c73ccecc305e313977a72d1c6f02260353ae99">purchase of tickets</a> . <br><br>  While waiting for RailsClub, we don‚Äôt get tired of telling you about foreign guests.  Read, for example, <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/railsclub/blog/191888/">an interview with Ernie Miller</a> or <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/railsclub/blog/192552/">what Jeremy Evans does in church during his free time</a> . <br><br>  Today, we will take a closer look at Eric Kodl, AT &amp; T developer and owner of the 2012 Ruby Hero Award.

I learned a little Logo in summer school, when my mother took me to work on weekends, and I reprinted basic programs from the last pages of magazines.  When I got a computer at home, I was finally able to figure out how the information was read from the joystick, forcing the car to move on the screen.  Before college, this was the peak of my programming opportunities. <br><br>  I started programming before I had a computer at home.  I would like to know how to do it.  It is a little bit more than a little schooling. <br><br>  <b>What are you working on right now?</b> <br><br>  AT &amp; T pays me for working on open source.  Now I am preparing for the release of RubyGems 2.1 (what happens before the conference) and the new release of RDoc with many minor changes and an updated look. <br><br>  My group at AT &amp; T is working on a cloud product, so lately I have been working with DRb.  This spring I wrote drbdump, which allows you to track DRb traffic.  I also played around with the distributed computation library built on top of DRb, and used it to test the regressions in RDoc. <br><br>  I'm paid to work on open source by AT &amp; T.  I am currently preparing for the release of the conference. <br><br>  I have been working with DRb lately.  This spring I wrote drbdump watch DRb traffic.  It has been a DRD. <br><br>  <b>What is the best, and what is the worst part of your work?</b> <br><br>  Since I work remotely, every few months I have to undergo corporate training on topics that do not apply to me, for example, on asbestos or fire safety.  Fortunately, this is not such a big inconvenience. <br><br>  The best thing is that I can choose open source projects that I want to work on, while gaining access to the cloud hardware without payment restrictions. <br><br>  Since I have been working, I like to go through training, office training, safety and security.  Fortunately this is only a minor annoyance. <br><br>  I would like to make it a problem. <br><br>  <b>What do you consider your main achievement in life / career at the moment?</b> <br><br>  I try to have as few bugs in my programs as possible. <br><br>  I think the recent releases of RubyGems 2.x answered this task.  All found bugs were minor and were fixed easily and without any problems.  But inside the rubygems have undergone dramatic changes, which could easily lead to a lot more bugs. <br><br>  I release as much as possible. <br><br>  I think these recent releases of RubyGems 2.x have met this goal.  Found to be a minor.  At the same time, there will be some major changes. <br><br>  <b>What is the purpose of your career and professional development?</b> <br><br>  I want to achieve a state in which I can support Ruby through open-source and will be open to everything new. <br><br>  I would like to give you my support. <br><br>  <b>What helps a programmer to grow professionally?</b> <br><br>  I always want to work on what I have not tried to do before.  Most recently, I experimented with OpenGL, basic game mechanics, and packet capture (which eventually led to drbdump). <br><br>  I've always wanted to before.  Most recently I've experimented with the OpenGL and basic game mechanics and packet capture (leading to drbdump). <br><br>  <b>What book would you recommend to read to any programmer?</b> <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe Pragmatic Programmer‚Äù is a great book, thanks to which I made many small discoveries that allow you to create high-quality software again and again. <br><br>  It helped me to make it a little bit more than that. <br><br>  <b>What do you like to do when you don't write code?</b> <br><br>  I play video games (mostly PlayStation), I mess around with home automation and arduino. <br><br>  I play video games (PlayStation, mostly), tinker with home automation and arduino. <br><br>  <b>Thanks for the interview and see you in Moscow!</b> <br><br><h5>  The conference </h5><br>  We invite everyone to the RailsClub'Moscow 2013 conference.
