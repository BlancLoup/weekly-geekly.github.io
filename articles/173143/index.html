The first applications for new top-level domains may be approved as early as <a href="http://www.webnames.ru/scripts/newsmaker.pl%3Fnews_id%3D1235">April 23</a> and soon delegated. <br><br>  The first to be launched are IDNs, or domain zones that use symbols of national letter types.  Cyrillic domains will be among them: .SITE, .ONLINE, .RUS, .THEUT, .MOSCOW., .CATHOLIK, .KOM, .ORG. <br><br>  Many already know about the <a href="http://www.webnames.ru/scripts/newsmaker.pl%3Fnews_id%3D784">domain. RUS</a> , intended for the global Russian-speaking community, and about the <a href="http://www.cctld.ru/ru/press_center/news/news_detail.php%3FID%3D1915">domain. Children</a> - a project to create an Internet segment for a children's audience.  Domains.COM and.ORG will become analogues of already existing Latin-speaking zones.  The domain for the Russian capital <a href="http://www.domainmoscow.ru/">.MOSCOW</a> and the domain <a href="http://www.katolik.ru/vatikan/113594-vatikan-podal-zayavku-na-priobretenie-domena-catholic-v-internete.html">.KATOLIK</a> speak for themselves, the application for which was submitted by the Catholic Church.

      However, the two domains - .SITE and .ONLINE - still remain a mystery to Internet users.  So far, practically nothing was known about these domain zones, except that the <a href="http://www.corenic.org/">CORE Association</a> submitted an application for them, where we asked to tell us more about the domains of interest to us. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Our questions were answered by the representative of the company Iliya Bazlyankov: <br><br>  <b>Webnames.ru:</b> CORE Association has applied for registration of only three domain zones, among which are .CAYT and .ONLINE.  Why were these domain names chosen?  Was it personally your idea? <br><br>  <b>IB:</b> In our opinion, many people underestimate the prospects for non-Latin (including Cyrillic) domain zones that are not limited by geography or nationality.  While VeriSign and PIR applications for domains.com.org and.org are targeted at domain owners in their Latin-language counterparts, domains.site and.online will be completely new domain spaces. <br><br>  When choosing domain names for registration, we relied on the results of marketing research.  We concluded that the website and the online is the best choice for the Cyrillic market.  After all, these domain names have a clear meaning, and at the same time they do not overlap with existing zones. <br><br>  We decided to apply for our own gTLDs after several months of discussions with the CORE Executive Committee.  Our company plans to provide registrar services, mainly for geographic domains, domains for communities and some domains of organizations.  But we ourselves decided to develop multilingual domain zones for a wide range of users - in those markets with which we are familiar through our partners and representatives.  As a result, applications were made for domains. Site,. Online and .ÿ®ÿßÿ≤ÿßÿ± (. Market).  The choice of these names seemed to us the most natural, which was confirmed by some studies. <br><br>  <b>Webnames.Ru:</b> Do you agree with the opinion that in countries using Cyrillic, the most promising and rapidly growing domain name market is currently? <br><br>  <b>IB:</b> Yes, we believe that the Cyrillic domain market is now the most promising, along with the Chinese one.  But, unfortunately, we do not have representatives and suitable partners in China to develop this area as well. <br><br>  <b>Webnames.Ru:</b> Almost no one knows about domains. Website and. Online in Russia.  How do you plan to promote these domain zones in our online community? <br><br>  <b>IB:</b> We are working in this direction.  We were hampered by some uncertainty in the timing of the implementation of the New gTLD program, however, the site and .online ranked high in the draw results.  Since these domains will be delegated among the first, users will know about them very soon.  We will begin the campaign to promote our domains after March 23, when the results of the assessment of applications for new gTLDs by the ICANN commission will be published. <br><br>  Some of our plans are: participation in events and conferences in Russia, Belarus, Ukraine and Bulgaria;  launching a multilingual website and blog, active participation in social networks, paid advertising and much more. <br><br>  <b>Webnames.Ru:</b> What is the "highlight" of these domains?  Why can a user choose a zone for his site, namely, a site and an online, and not any other existing or new top-level domain? <br><br>  <b>IB:</b> Domains.Site and .Online will provide free space for creating websites on any subject with no restrictions on linguistic, geographical or national grounds.  They are focused on the widest range of Cyrillic Internet users.  You can create any website: about yourself, your company, your interests - and in any of the Cyrillic languages: Russian, Ukrainian, Belarusian, Bulgarian ... <br><br>  <b>Webnames.Ru:</b> What would you like to tell more about domains.Site and.online? <br><br>  <b>IB:</b> Now we are preparing a campaign to promote these domains, which will begin shortly after the ICANN meeting in Beijing.  We will let you know about it. <br><br>  <i>The Core Association, or the Domain Name Registrar Council, is a non-profit organization founded in 1996.</i>  <i>Over the years, he has been actively cooperating with ICANN and is an accredited domain name registrar.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>The company was created to support the new domain zones.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>CORE has been actively involved in the design and development of advanced domain registration methods and protocols, such as the Distributed Registration System (SRS) and the Registration Gateway.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>The company provided registry technical support during the launch of the .aero (2002), .museum (2003) and .cat (2006) domains.</i>  <i>At the moment, CORE provides technical support services for .museum and .cat domains, and also operates a neutral channel connecting registries and registrars of all public domain zones (gTLDs) and many national domain zones (ccTLDs).</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>ORE sponsored several international ICANN conferences.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>CORE plans to take an active part in the development of the new top-level domain program, offering services to an ICANN-accredited registrar.</i>  <i>For its part, the company applied for three new domain zones: .site, .online and .ÿ®ÿßÿ≤ÿßÿ± (".bazar" or ".market" in Arabic).</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/173143/">https://habr.com/ru/post/173143/</a></p>
