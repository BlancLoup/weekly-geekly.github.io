Is it clear that everything is already good or can it be done better? <br>  For example, it‚Äôs bad that having a small botnet (‚Äúfriends-comrades‚Äù) can crush any novice author or commentator, and you should not wait for objectivity, it may just be a different opinion, not the same as others. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  First, the evaluation of the article and the evaluation of the commentary cannot have the same weight for karma, since the article implies the expression of thoughts or opinions in public, and comments are seen only by those who comment. <br>  This is both legal and physical responsibility - it is different, public statements are not comparable with statements in the kitchen. <br>  Secondly, the rating of the author or commentator can influence the weight of his voice in the evaluation of comments or articles.  You can also introduce a restriction on commenting on the height of the rating, but there should be an opportunity for open articles, <br>  and if someone puts a negative assessment, then theoretically he can get into another list of comments on this article, conditionally it can be divided into two parts, where the total weight of the authors of the parties is important for raising (highlighting) the comment thread. <br>  In general, text colors can be better seen on a dark background and the commentator‚Äôs ‚Äúside‚Äù can be taken into account in the comment background, and an article, for example, always with a static background, now only the comment text color changes, but in general there can be another design pattern so that you can choose between them (dark side, light).

      <br>
      For the author of comments and the entire article, part of the karma may come from the comments, as well as from the article itself, if the article is positive, then the author‚Äôs opinion will be more significant in the comments and the animation of the karma involved may come from the state of all post ratings, if someone is positive, then the multiplier of the article is added, which may decrease in proportion to the number of readers and comments added (in a closed post, everything goes to the author, for example). <br>  Permanent karma can walk before recalculation, but there should be a karma pool that a user can spend per day, the pool expands with the rating and the pool cannot be pushed more negative karma than can be - here comes karma from comments, it goes to statics from public ones.  The pool is a kind of monetary system. <br>  Relations between invited users can be taken into account according to a more complex pattern of distribution of karma - children, parentes, mentors, friends can have a certain factor in evaluating the text of this particular author, as well as in evaluating other users.  Such an analysis can be from the client side, exactly how you can think of it. <br><br>  The text itself should also acquire the status of 0 author, 1 translation (+), 2 copy-paste, 3 news (event), 4 articles (+ post, description), 5 abstract (refactoring, not your own words) 6 training material (+ tutorial, science) - these are not exactly tags, but they have to be put together, according to the type, the significance of the document needs to be determined, and additional weight to the estimates can be offered - user specialization. <br>  verification can be carried out in theory by users, but generally there should be Ai (we take, ideally, or just another search query with semantic analysis). <br>  Naturally the multiplier (multiplier) of karma for different articles may differ, as well as the conditions of publication may vary. <br><br>  For beginners - ideological balance, the user is on balance, can have a kind of immunity until he presses the button of adult life (public topic), but he cannot argue with adults (not minus and limited in the number of signs per day, signs aggregate) - this is good educational practice <br>  when receiving karma, it can somehow use it, but basically it is impossible to drive it to a minus balance. <br>  Chained death - if someone minus all the posts in a row of one author, then theoretically it is easy to calculate and such an estimate gets into karma as -1 / (the minus rate is the author's rate), so it will be easy to clean out the trolls from the comments. <br>  Multidirectional ratings reduce the rating of the voter. <br><br>  There is a truth, the problem is that not many people read some of the topics at all, and the number of views of other unique users may be involved in such estimates.  Members of other hubs may be undervalued if they do not understand the specifics <br>  and this indicator can be obtained from the statistics of visits to a particular hub or estimated by the comments of the participants of this hub, that is, if the text is evaluated by authors from the same hub, then this assessment of this text can affect the user‚Äôs status in this hub, <br>  and the general status of the hub may have weight already in the ranking of all authors (to simplify calculations) based not only on the rating of articles, but also on the rating of participants.  A hub may appear, where only high-ranking members will have a subscription, and it will play here that comments only from hub subscribers and an open post - this brings order to thoughts a bit. <br>  On hubs with a minimum karma limit, you can pour the rating into the karma pool for publication, if it replays, the rating does not decrease.  The possibility of publishing through the approval of more authoritative users to another hub, generally speaking, can lead to the substitution of copyrights, so here again a free pool of other users can play or skip off the number of characters from the balance sheet. <br><br>  Editing comment threads and post text.  - Here the author‚Äôs rating can play, for example, if someone with a higher rating allows editing the post, the author edits it, the primary version is recorded in static content, there may be several revisions during the day, for example, for a more frequent correction - the rating is subtracted, count the number of corrected characters.  The ability to close the branch for the flame may be approved by several users. <br>  If there are subscribers, then there should be a list of blocked ones.  With a thousand subscribers, you can open your hub.  Naturally impact on the rating and rating.  Theoretically, each plus and minus can update the subscription list to the author or add locks, here you need a more subtle perm ban mechanism.  Add to favorites + subscriber. <br><br>  Fix bugs: <br>  - when moving from post to question, the text is lost, if later from the question back to the post, too. <br>  - if you press Enter in tags, the publication begins <br>  or is it a feature? <br><br>  ================== lyrics <br><br>  Today, all relations in society have accelerated due to the introduction of high technologies, but we continue to live in the context of analogies and approaches have not changed in some areas. <br>  Economic relations can be compared with the same distribution of karma in Habr√©, due to the fact that the assessment is quite archaic and often just emotionally, there are "corruption schemes" to drain topics, users, comments. <br>  In Forex, about the same thing happens on stock exchanges in other areas, when the valuation of the goods is deliberately underestimated for profit, for example, or to reduce indirect costs - the mechanism is about the same. <br>  Therefore, the improvement of rules ‚Äî trade (WTO), legal relations, and civil society ‚Äî becomes important work. <br><br>  There are ways of development, but they need to be described, thought out, weighed up the pros and cons, and accepted is the decision standard. <br>  Most people today simply say - like \ no, but they don‚Äôt even think about solving problems. <br>  code changes still need to be well refactored and it is advisable to build an action plan in advance, to take into account the opinions of users. <br>  In economics and politics, it is difficult to predict, since the social system itself is not comprehensible and depends on the weather and moods. <br>  Responsibility for decisions costs people to lives, so people themselves should also be involved in the decision-making process, and not just blame someone, some make decisions, but others do.  In principle, responsibility and functions in society are divided in this way, but in many respects it resembles a parasitic model, but we must proceed to a symbiosis. <br>  And for this we need certain mechanisms, in economic life it is money, loans, but life is actually not a simple thing, and it can regulate a lot, additional artificial mechanisms can slow down development if they are not abandoned or evolve at the right time. .  For example, wood stoves are no longer needed now, but we already have electronic money and we need to improve this system, look for mistakes not for exploits, but so that the entire social organism can move on. <br><br>  How to live better?  - help others.  start thinking.  start solving other people's problems, if possible. <br>  Everyone has their own best abilities that can and should be used so that the world around them changes for the better, and does not go to the thermonuclear apocalypse.  And the world is not only people, therefore, in general, you need to take care of everything at once, but the division into functions has already been formed and we must learn how to use them correctly in a common environment. <br>  Basically, in a society, everything depends on relations between people and at the basis of society is common.  - air, water, logic, laws of the universe, in general + nothing to share, because it does not belong to anyone and everything is one. <br>  Humanity has the task of the survival of the species as such and the survival of the planet as a whole - while individuals should not be crushed, they just need to find that balance of relationships and this is a certain difficult job, which nonetheless has already been done and religion has become the result.  Democracy, science - this is also religion - a set of rules that are better to follow in life. <br>  Now conditions have changed and relations between people will also have to undergo changes as they become for posterity, in many respects depends on those who are now solving socially important tasks.  And in fact, it makes everyone through personal choice. <br><br>  Do not participate or distance from a process akin to public void () {null}. <br>  It‚Äôs impossible to say that all the functions and resources of society are private, it‚Äôs impossible not to take into account private requests for classes, nor to inherit public abstract. <br>  For me, this is similar to social programming and logic has certain parallels. <br>  Karma, like quantum dots or photons, should not be visible to people at all, perfect laws nonetheless work and this is proved by the existence of life. <br>  Also note that karma itself is a superstructure to protect against unscrupulous user activity (violating the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/info/help/other/">code or etiquette of habr</a> ) in information ranking systems. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/195568/">https://habr.com/ru/post/195568/</a></p>
