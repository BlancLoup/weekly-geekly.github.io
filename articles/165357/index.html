      Microsoft did not allow us to take photos here at CES 2013 and did not give additional comments about the price, operating time or components, except what we already know: $ 899 for a model with 64GB and $ 999 for 128GB.  Both come with 4GB of RAM and no keyboard. <br><br>  Unlike the already sold Surface RT, Surface Pro is a full-fledged PC that you can use both as a laptop and as a tablet.  On board Windows 8 Pro, this means that all the desktop applications on it will go, but it is still touch-friendly, and you can put the keyboard aside when you don't need it. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Surface Pro looks similar to Surface RT.  It also looks expensive, and its sides are beveled at a 22 degree angle for a comfortable viewing angle when it stands on a stand with a keyboard. <br><br>  Yes, Surface Pro is slightly heavier than Surface RT (900 grams versus 680), but it is balanced.  This means that the tablet does not seem much heavier.  Lighter devices have a plastic case, not a magnesium alloy, which makes Surface so reliable.  Like the Surface RT, the Surface Pro feels solid and durable. <br><br>  When we said ‚Äúbalanced‚Äù, we meant that he does not roll to the side and he does not slip when you take him by the edge.  It also stably stands on its stand.  As promised, the Type and Touch Cover from Surface RT go to Surface Pro and join in the same way. <br><br>  <b>Performance</b> <br>  With a core i5 onboard, Surface Pro gets more options than Surface RT.  Microsoft still doesn‚Äôt specify what kind of ‚Äúthird generation processor‚Äù with Intel HD 4000 graphics is, so they don‚Äôt comment on whether it is a updated 7-watt processor presented at CES. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/32f/b10/84d/32fb1084d7018d1045973149134c899e.jpg" alt="Intel core"><br><br>  In reality, what Microsoft calls peripheral ventilation is a ventilation slot along the beveled edge of Surface.  They dissipate heat well so that there are no hot spots on the tablet.  Even when launching loaded desktop applications, we did not feel the heating of the tablet or the flow of warm air, as is usually the case with notebook fans.  We also did not hear the fan noise.  Surface Pro is not perceived as a laptop, wedged into the body of the tablet, although it provides all its features. <br><br>  Even considering the ventilation, Microsoft found a place to move the microSD slot from under the stand (where it was difficult to find it) to the right side, next to the video port where you can easily manipulate the card. <br><br>  The tablet has a Mini DisplayPort and an adapter for VGA.  VGA support instead of HDMI is due to the fact that there are still a lot of screens and projectors working through this port in business.  The tilt angle of the case obliges you to take a branded cable to be sure of a secure, fixed, connection.  ( <i>Obviously, they do not know how to use a stationery knife - approx. Transl.</i> ) <br><br>  In addition, Surface Pro is different from the Surface RT USB port, which is here the third version.  Now transferring large files can take seconds.  USB 3.0 is not as sexy as Apple's Thunderbolt, but it allows you to get the same speed.  In addition, there are now many high-speed USB3.0 drives. <br><br>  The screen is still the same size of 10.6 ", and it still looks great: with natural black and bright, saturated colors. But the resolution is higher. 1920x1080 is true HD. And it is still touch-sensitive, but already recognizes 10 fingers, and not 5. (You get even more possible manipulations in music applications, for example) ( <i>Probably, there are interfaces in the form of a mixer - approx. transl.</i> ) <br><br>  <b>New feather</b> <br>  Among other things, Surface Pro has its own active pen, so you can fall just like a mouse, or draw and write smoothly on the screen.  Office is not shipped with Surface, but we tested the pen in OneNote 2013 (and <i>probably means OneNote MX - approx. Transl.</i> ) And FreshPaint.  You can write quickly - the tip of the pen will not slip on the surface of the screen. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2dc/183/259/2dc18325976b20e8237efceae3a0b72b.jpg" alt="pen"><br><br>  When the pen is near the screen, finger input is blocked and your hand does not interfere with writing or drawing.  The pen is touch sensitive (although this is not the Wacom that we saw on most tablets), so the harder you press, the thicker the line. <br><br>  A good sized feather in itself: not as diminutive as that of Asus, and not as huge as that of HP EliteBook Revolve.  It is light, comfortable and feels good in the hand.  Flip it over and you can use the back part like an eraser.  It allows you to erase the inscription smoothly and naturally. <br><br>  On the side there is a large button that performs the right mouse click.  In addition, the button is a magnet that enters the power port on the edge of the tablet.  So you can pin the pen there. <br><br>  The magnet safely holds the pen, we could not shake the tablet a little by the pen, as you can shake the Surface RT by the keyboard, but when you unhook it, it does not go away immediately.  so that the pen does not fall off in the bag or from the first blow. <br><br>  <b>Full Windows 8</b> <br>  Like the keyboard, the magnets hold the pen on the edge of the tablet so that you need to firmly and firmly pull to disconnect them.  We, of course, would prefer the dock for the pen inside the tablet, but we would not want to thicken the latter.  So this is quite an elegant alternative. <br><br>  Due to the use of the pen button as a fastener, the usual clip is turned perpendicularly relative to it.  The clip does not fall under the arm when the pen is attached, and it does not stick out, allowing you to easily dislodge the pen from the mount. <br><br>  All this shows the same attention to detail, which highlights the Surface RT.  But this time we are dealing with a full-fledged computer, managed by Windows 8 and running all your software. <br><br>  We didn‚Äôt have enough time to test the battery, but the app from the store is as responsive as on Surface RT, and the desktop programs seem to be as responsive as you would expect from a Core i5.  The first real Microsoft computer is really good and portable, and this stands out. <br><br>  UPD. <br>  There is also a <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2013/01/09/microsoft-surface-pro-hands-on/">review on engadget</a> .  He is not imbued with "marketing" expressions, but no less positive.  Thanks <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/akastix/" class="user_link">akaStiX</a> for the tip <br><br>  UPD 2. <br>  Again a positive <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/1/9/3857076/microsoft-surface-pro-in-depth-impressions">review from The Vegre</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/165357/">https://habr.com/ru/post/165357/</a></p>
