  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Citrix Tech Exchange Moscow 2016: how it changed my attitude to Xen</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In mid-February, a Citrix Tech Exchange conference was held in Moscow.  In general, this is certainly not the ‚Äúevent of the year‚Äù, but not uninteresting, at least.  Under the cut, I'll write a little about the conference itself and a lot about what reflections it brought me to.  Well, the photo will also be.  <abbr title="Picture To Attract Attention">KDPV</abbr> : <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c55/7a2/7d8/c557a27d8b3b4425a94caf739beaf109.png"><br>  And by the way, there is a <b>survey after the post</b> , a big request to express your opinion. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  A few words about the conference.  I am always going to such events with great skepticism, but almost always they turn out to be better than my expectations.  Citrix Tech Exchange is no exception.  Everything was at the proper level, which in general is not surprising for a global company.  Convenient location - Swiss Hotel on the banks of the Moscow River.  No hustle upon registration, although quite a lot of visitors.  Delicious coffee cookies and a hearty lunch.  Plenary presentation on the company's key products.  Parallel sessions: ‚ÄúGeek Speak‚Äù, ‚ÄúTechnological Debates‚Äù, ‚ÄúAsk an Expert‚Äù, ‚ÄúTesting‚Äù, ‚ÄúDemo Zone‚Äù.  In general, anyone who is somehow interested in Citrix products and solutions would find everything they need on Tech Exchange.  I highly recommend watching the video from the opening of the conference, there are a few minutes, but it's worth it.  Yes, yes, girls with KDPV from there.  ;-) <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/qXbcI3N6c4g%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgPzfkJs8kG91jtoW6MVyxSlilTnw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  When googling this video, I found several others, it may be interesting for someone to see: <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DN8Ybjb4DY-w">Thomas Berger: Virtualization / Mobility Innovations</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D9nIyX84evzI">Thomas Zell: Citrix Industry Trends and Networking Solutions</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DypgLLANwm_s">Ronan O'Brien: New Citrix Network Solutions</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DPO39HrXLFVU">Thomas Zell.</a>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DPO39HrXLFVU">Secure application and data delivery</a> <br>  ... and still there. <br><br>  Photo, which conveys the general atmosphere of the event: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a4c/a3d/647/a4ca3d647f7043459a94a578c157f949.jpg">

None of us likes to admit our mistakes.  And me as well.  But sometimes it is useful to look back and re-read their posts.  In 2011, when <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/125748/">I wrote about the virtualization market</a> , I was very pessimistic about the prospects for Citrix.  So, I was wrong.  Yes. <br><br>  Not that I completely disagree with what I myself wrote then.  I just did not take into account the fact that Citrix may change.  And she changed, and quickly enough. <br><br>  First and foremost, Citrix, as it seems to me, was at that time very ‚Äúout of focus‚Äù, the company had a wide product line, from IaaS to online services, which, instead of synergistic effect, sprayed forces.  Now Citrix has focused on key products, more specifically, XenApp, XenDesktop, XenMobile, NetScaler, and ShareFile.  Who is interested in digging deeper, I advise you to read the article ‚Äú <a href="http://www.pcweek.ru/business/article/detail.php%3FID%3D182571">Citrix is ‚Äã‚Äãreturning to a proven path of development</a> ‚Äù <br><br>  The second.  Have you noticed that there are ‚ÄúXen‚Äù in the names of three of the five key products?  In 2011, I was sure that the platform, and not the vendor, would win the virtualization market.  I'm sure of it now.  And Citrix has taken strong steps towards making Xen an open platform.  In 2012, it <a href="http://www.opennet.ru/opennews/art.shtml%3Fnum%3D35243">became the ‚Äúgold‚Äù sponsor of the Linux Foundation</a> , in 2013, the <a href="http://www.opennet.ru/opennews/art.shtml%3Fnum%3D36703">Xen</a> project <a href="http://www.opennet.ru/opennews/art.shtml%3Fnum%3D36703">passed under the wing of the Linux Foundation organization</a> , and a little later, <a href="http://www.opennet.ru/opennews/art.shtml%3Fnum%3D37277">Citrix transferred XenServer to the category of open source projects</a> .  In other words, Xen has become a project independent of individual manufacturers, which cannot but please me, because  I have always been for the friendly competition between open hypervisors (Xen and KVM) and for their collaboration. <br><br>  Third.  Not only the internal conditions in the company changed (for those who did not hear, a native of Russia, <a href="https://www.citrix.com/news/announcements/jan-2016/citrix-appoints-kirill-tatarinov-as-president-and-ceo.html">Kirill Tatarinov became the head of Citrix</a> ), but, more importantly, the conditions of external competition.  Since it was announced that Dell is buying EMC for $ 67 billion (and I remind you that EMC owns part of VMware) from the largest suppliers of enterprise solutions, such as IBM, HPE and Lenovo, the number of reasons to cooperate with Citrix has increased, than with vmware.  ;-) <br><br>  <b>And now a small survey.</b> <br>  Given all the above, how do you think, can the Xen project (exactly as a platform) get a new impetus in development?  Or in the virtualization market, nothing will drastically change?  Comments on this topic are also welcome. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/278071/">https://habr.com/ru/post/278071/</a></p>
