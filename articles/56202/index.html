  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Feedback on the 8th meeting of StartupPoint</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <strong>A place</strong> <br>  Held in the club "B2", not very intended for such events.  Following the meeting, supported the proposal to meet in the institute classrooms. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <strong>Startups</strong> <br>  <a href="http://tolkona5.ru/">tolkona5.ru</a> .  Personally, the service seemed interesting to me, but I did not make it to the final.  He pumps up the title - when I first saw it, I tried to understand what Tolcon is and why 5. <br>  <a href="http://vselisdelal.ru/">vselisdelal.ru</a> .  Excellent service, but the name also does not reflect the essence of the project - I associate it with todo-lists and other things.  Successful future. <br>  <a href="http://qiqo.ru/">QiQo.ru</a> is a startup that I still remember from <a href="http://icamp.ru/home.php">iCamp08</a> .  If my memory serves me, the same guy represented <a href="http://www.scribbler.ru/">www.scribbler.ru</a> 4 weeks ago.  If this is the case, then dividing attention into several startups is a bad sign.  For 2 minutes, the presentation was too tied to the slides (there was a remark in the hall ‚Äúfor 2 minutes there should be 1 slide at all!‚Äù), And because of the hitch with their display, the story was interrupted in mid-sentence.  Public interest was not shown. <br>  <a href="http://vstrecher.ru/">vstrecher.ru</a> - the service was advanced to the final, but its prospects in the fight against both direct (Wi2Geo) and indirect (ICQ + phone) competitors are foggy.  Most remembered was not the presenter, but the girl who literally lynched his questions and summed up: "that's it, I have no more questions." <br>  <a href="http://kinokrug.ru/">kinokrug.ru</a> - a highly specialized network.  When I read the description, I immediately recalled the words of Philip Smirnov (inVenture) that the network should not be for someone, but earning from something.  Is there something about Kinokrug? <br>  The speaker was not embarrassed by the end of time for the presentation, and he vividly continued it after the signal.  Narrow service did not arouse public interest. <br>  <a href="http://integrator.in/">integrator.in</a> is a bold project for the redistribution of the advertising industry.  I can not disagree with Alexei Ramensky, who noted that this should be a service that helps current players, rather than becoming a competitor to them. <br>  On the other hand, he will still be a competitor to managers sitting on kickbacks, and I haven‚Äôt heard about the plan for breaking the resistance to service. <br>  The problem of advertising on a heap of TV channels seems far-fetched, the reason "now you will receive quotations signed by the directors of the channels" - as well.  I could not understand why this cannot be achieved with the current scheme if I want to. <br>  When there is Beeline, ready to pay for the toolkit - this is great, but this does not mean that it should be moved further this way. <br>  <a href="http://tsigan.ru/">tsigan.ru</a> - it was interesting to listen to the history of a creative startup and watch a cartoon, but the business at the box office is very far from the practice of those present in the hall (well, except for the Kinokrug team). <br><br>  <strong>Speakers</strong> <br>  <strong>Sergey Mitrofanov</strong> from Brandflight.  He offered to think about building a brand, showed the way and his vision of the issue.  I didn‚Äôt want to advertise openly, but after the direct question of the very active girl (see vstrecher), he answered that there is a separate program for start-ups, which he is ready to perform for a share, but with payment at cost. <br>  Sergey believes that it is the development of the brand that will allow not to change the concept of a startup in the course of its development - and thus save on reorientation. <br>  Personally, I disagree: the main reason for the reorientation is to resolve uncertainties that are not understandable before entering the market.  What about thinking the brand, that without. <br><br>  <strong>Nikita Khalyavin</strong> .  The odious project professionali.ru raised questions not on the subject of the report both during and after Nikita‚Äôs speech.  His main idea is ‚Äúhire employees for dating‚Äù in my opinion is too banal to make a report on it.  It was not possible to clearly hear from the report, what correctly motivated these acquaintances.  Judging by the thesis, ‚Äúacquaintances will not let you down, because they are their own‚Äù Nikita is not much acquainted with the dashing 90s, when someone just did not do business with his people.  And how it all ended. <br>  In my opinion, the weakest of the reports of the person to whom there are many more questions not on the topic of the report.

      <strong>Alexey Ramensky</strong> , ROCIT.  Interesting performance with a fresh realistic look, unusual startups.  Another well-told reminder that the main thing is not the product, but the promotion and sale of this product. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/56202/">https://habr.com/ru/post/56202/</a></p>
