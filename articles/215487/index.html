Why did we decide to open such a rubric?  The fact is that hundreds of specialists working in the Mail.Ru Group read many interesting articles and posts on the forums every day to solve their tasks.  Some of them seem interesting to us, and we consider it our duty to translate them into Russian and share this valuable knowledge with Habrazhiteli. <br><br>  Taking this opportunity, we want to announce the news: today the opening of Technopark took place - our educational project, which we have already written about more than once in Habr√© (for example, <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/mailru/blog/186962/">here</a> , <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/mailru/blog/175511/">here</a> and <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/mailru/blog/184590/">here</a> ).  Now technoparkovtsy <a href="http://corp.mail.ru/blog/newtehnopark/">have their own premises</a> .  Initially, Technopark is conceived as a place where talented students of MSTU are.  Bauman can get additional education in web development, design and programming, as well as plunge into the work on real projects of high complexity.  In general, Technopark today has a significant day, and therefore we decided to dedicate the first issue in the ‚ÄúTranslations‚Äù column to educational resources for web developers and web designers.  Indeed, while such Technoparks have not spread throughout the country, developers often have to deal exclusively with self-education. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c47/8ca/c09/c478cac0970210f04c7418f19db03b10.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Fortunately, learning is no longer a luxury, available only to a minority;  today, it‚Äôs not even necessary to go to school or go to university.  The Internet has made it possible to spread knowledge for free or at an affordable price;  He is full of resources that allow us to expand our knowledge in various fields. <br><br>  Since you can study all your life, and not just until you receive a certain certificate of education, this review is not only about beginners.  It is for everyone who would like to become an expert in any field or is simply interested in the Internet, the latest tools and developments in this area.
