Dizzy success is different from ‚Äúordinary‚Äù success, and you don‚Äôt have to be Richard or Elon in order to achieve financial well-being, realization and in general take place in life. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Realizing this, a person increases his chances of becoming happy.  But if you are truly passionate, and your passion determines you, determines your behavior, then who you are, defines you in everything, then the question of happiness ceases to be relevant.  Hobby people are often perceived as kooks, ‚Äúwrong‚Äù members of society, preferring atypically complex ways.  They develop their own survival strategy, eventually understanding how to apply it to different things in order to benefit from them, to gain an advantage.  They think differently than others.  They look at the world from unusual angles, from perspectives that open up new ideas and give insight.  Because of this, people around them consider them a bit crazy. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a79/795/51e/a7979551e9b5433889828c4c6f4c1d0e.jpg">

      <b>Be obsessed</b> <br><br>  Be obsessed <br><br>  Be obsessed <br><br>  If suddenly you are not obsessed with your business, now stop doing it and concentrate on finding something that will really enthrall you.  The idea should be large-scale, really big and inspiring, so that people believe in you and turn into like-minded people (and you will need like-minded people, do not hesitate).  A really big goal will not allow you to relax and rest on your laurels at the moment when people notice your work and start vying to tell you how cool you are and how cool what you are doing while it‚Äôs not.  Do not chase the dream because of the desire to become great.  Chase the dream, because it's worth it, and because this race itself makes you who you are.  All outstanding people, professional pursuers of dreams, combine intelligence and talent with a selfless love of work.  And if you made a mistake in choosing a dream, you will quickly burn out and find yourself on the sidelines, and you will only have to watch how others bypass you and are carried away to the cherished distance. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/50e/6fc/b0b/50e6fcb0b6184e13941ae4a9ce3d4fde.jpg"><br><br>  Follow your obsession until you find a <b>problem</b> , a big, serious problem that affects the maximum number of people, a problem that you solve, by all means, or you will die trying.  It may take years until this problem is found, because before you have to master a large array of different knowledge, find the necessary points, and then connect them, having built a holistic concept in your head. <br><br>  For such accomplishments need superhuman energy and endurance.  If you are not a demigod, be sure to pay attention to the physical form and lifestyle.  You have a frequent change of time zones, mental fatigue, exhausting, often meaningless meetings, loneliness, failures, problems with the second half, which always lack time, family dramas, emotional turmoil, communication with boring and annoying people, lack of sleep.  Keep your body in shape to keep your mind as sharp as a razor.  These costs will pay off. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fe8/c68/ea9/fe8c68ea9fc44688a56848984f74416f.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Learn to withstand the stress that most people would break.</b> <br><br>  Do not go the beaten path;  contrary to the admiration of your idols, do not try to imitate them.  The ‚Äúnext step‚Äù does not exist.  Phenomenal success is not like other types of success - which worked for someone, probably will not work in your case.  Extremes of success are carriers of daring ideas that subordinate their set of certain unique advantages to the cause.  They are <b>extraordinary</b> , and this is one of the reasons why they become entrepreneurs - they cannot or do not want to fit into the usual corporate life.  They are dyslexics, autists, they are absent-minded, they are white crows, they annoy and argue with colleagues, they rock the boat, despise instructions and in general any bureaucracy.  But they turn these ‚Äúweaknesses‚Äù into additional advantages (I mentioned them a little higher), and this does not prevent them from finding partners as partners who have achieved something in areas in which they themselves are not oriented at all. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e9a/194/451/e9a1944516d445ce9ffc3bbadd5ae65e.jpg"><br><br>  They are not afraid of failures - or maybe they are afraid, but they still go forward.  They will surely survive the epically beautiful and humiliating public failure, but then they will find the strength to shift the focus so that the collapse will seem to them and others just another step on the path to a dream.  They experience failures differently than others, and draw conclusions from them that are inaccessible to others.  They are incredibly persistent and at the same time psychologically stable. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1bc/606/d83/1bc606d83f9448e69210c66e460cec35.jpg"><br><br>  And they are unlikely to read texts like this article (this is not sarcasm and not mockery at you, dear reader, I myself love similar motivating materials).  They are likely to take up the book: perhaps the biography of Alexander the Great, Catherine the Great, or someone else they consider great.  Sitting on the Internet, it is very easy to kill hours and days, and people who remember how much their time is worth, and that they can catch up in that time, simply cannot afford it. <br><br>  I could go on with this exciting, gracious subject, but I suppose you already understood my point.  I wish you good luck, strength, and perhaps a glass of something strong for courage. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/290134/">https://habr.com/ru/post/290134/</a></p>
