  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Design Calendar</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><h1>  Russian kinetism </h1><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1e6/98d/dce/1e698ddce98355bd6e2a862891f58df4.jpg" alt="182.jpg" title="182.jpg" width="140" height="190" align="left">  The State Hermitage Museum closed the exhibition ‚ÄúAlberto Byazi.  Kinetic and computer art in Italy and Russia ".  Its main advantage was the opportunity to once again assess the merits of not so much Italian as Russian creativity.  The works of famous Italians - V.Vazareli, A.Byazi, H. Demarko, - who laid the foundations of modern industrial design, echoed the objects of Russian masters, striking the phenomenality of spatial thinking. <a name="habracut"></a><br>  Among the works, Boris Stuchebryukov‚Äôs objects were shown: the kinetic sculpture ‚ÄúGalatea‚Äù 1994, ‚ÄúTransformobile‚Äù 1987 and Mobiler, which were included in the anthology of twentieth-century art. <h1>  ArchStack on-line </h1><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1af/217/46e/1af21746ea7e494c17ad70e0a8b2e52e.jpg" alt="183.jpg" title="183.jpg" width="170" height="152" align="left">  The main design event of this summer was the Festival ArkhStoyanie, which opened its history on the banks of the River Ugra.  17 participants from among the representatives of the architectural establishment and 6 novice architects began to transform the reserve into an artistic colony.  The interactive nature of objects that assumed ‚Äúarchiving‚Äù and riding on them, ‚Äúarchiving‚Äù on them, as well as their ‚Äúarchdeeding‚Äù (and other types of participation in creative work) contributed to the transformation of the territory into a public forum.  Having initiated the organization of the festival, V. and A. Shchetinin, V. Kopeiko, N. Polissky and other ‚Äúdiscoverers‚Äù and regulars of the village of Nikola-Lenivets, with the support of the administration of the Kaluga region, prevented the total building of the rarely protected landscape.

Competition works were presented in the nominations "Poster", "Book" and "Calligraphy" of participants from 46 countries.  The authors presented hundreds of works in several branches of printing art.  Traditionally, the jury consisted of well-known graphic design masters. <br>  In one of the halls there was an exhibition of posters of David Tartakower, winner of the Grand Prix of the Golden Bee 6.  The winners of the Golden Bee 7 are Anette Lenz and Vincent Peroutier (France, Grand Prix). <h1>  "Design and polgrafiya </h1><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/725/0f9/799/7250f979911262b7b0dd0ef84f2f6fb3.jpg" alt="185.jpg" title="185.jpg" width="145" height="206" align="left">  The 4th Fair of Printing Services Design and Printing, which is a developed section of the Design and Advertising exhibition, marked the beginning of a business year.  The DiP gathered participants who presented a huge range of printing directions characterizing the state of the domestic market.  Were shown samples of offset, digital, screen and tampo printing, work in silk-screen printing and other techniques. <br>  The main areas presented at the exhibition, organized by the company Expo-Park Exhibition Projects in the Central House of Artists, were: the creation and promotion of a brand, printing services, materials and equipment for printing industry. <h1>  Bombay sapphire </h1><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e0c/517/b23/e0c517b2391588d231d0f494afee5776.jpg" alt="186.jpg" title="186.jpg" width="230" height="148" align="left">  Chandelier Voyage designer Yves Beara became the main event of the i Saloni Worldwide Moscow exhibition, held in Crocus Expo in October.  Shining with 52 thousand Swarowski crystals, the 4-meter-long Moebius band pulsed with sapphire diodes.  With waves of light, a mystical object reacted to crowds of visitors, constantly changing the intensity of its color.  The magic of crystal irides combined with the secret of the exotic drink "Bombay Sapphire", which became the symbol of the exhibition.  The company producing cult liqueur for the second time acted as a partner of the largest design event in Moscow. <br>  As part of the Milan exposition, an exhibition of Bombay Sapphire Glass Exhibition was presented. <h1>  VI week decor magazine "Mezonin" </h1><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/41f/ac5/821/41fac5821f1764a0b06516053abd3261.jpg" alt="187.jpg" title="187.jpg" width="190" height="182" align="left">  September 15‚Äì19, the 6th WEEK of the DECOR of the Mezonin magazine was held at the Manezh Central Exhibition Hall.  The theme for 2006 was declared ‚ÄúMy Perfect Interior‚Äù.  The stands of Russian and foreign decorators and architects were designed as living spaces in author's styles.  This year, the composition of the creative section has been almost completely updated.  Permanent participants of past years headed the jury for the selection of young artists in the new zone "Debut".  A separate exhibition was presented by the Belgian designer Arne Quans (Arne Quinze), the owner of the company "Quinze &amp; Milan".  Among the celebrities exhibited Rustam Hamdam. <br>  The award ‚ÄúThe Name of the Year in Interior Design‚Äù was awarded following the ‚ÄúDebut‚Äù section and was personally presented by Her Royal Highness Princess of Kent, along with His Majesty, as in 2005, who arrived to award the winner.  Award sponsor 2006 - the company "English Interiors". <br>  <a href="http://archvestnik.ru/">Magazine: Architectural Gazette</a> </div>
