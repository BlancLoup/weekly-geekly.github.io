      According to the results of the program, participants can pass an assessment center and get an objective assessment of their own work, having established themselves as potential employees of the company. <br><br>  We are sure that the participants themselves will better tell about the internship program, so we publish in our blog reviews of our summer practice in Mars on two students who responded to an offer to share their impressions. <br><br>  <b>Ekaterina Lukasheva, Mars Service Desk:</b> <br><br>  When I asked my classmate, a former trainee of Mars, what is remarkable about the internship at this company, she suggested that I find the answer to this question myself.  In April, I saw an ad for interns at Mars IS for the summer and decided to give it a try. <br>  The first stage of the selection was a video interview, which should show my interests, motivation and goals.  I graduated from the Faculty of Philology and Journalism and got into IT accidentally.  Therefore, at all stages of selection I needed to clearly formulate what kind of experience I want to get in Mars. <br><br>  In addition to the desire to "feel" IT, I, as a linguist student, strove to an international company in order to develop my language skills, as well as learn what a large corporation is and how IT helps business.  I was also attracted by the opportunity to learn how to quickly respond and cope with tasks that require quick solutions. <br>  Before I got to the Mars Service Desk, it was all just words and thoughts.  Only when you start practical work, you are convinced that you get a really useful experience. <br><br>  On the first day of the internship, I met the guys from my team.  In the Mars Service Desk, there are three language subcommands - Russian-English, French and German (although the latter two also receive calls in English).  I got to the last, because my main foreign language at the university is German. <br><br>  This team is the smallest, but it does not reduce either the level of responsibility or the amount of work.  In the activities of each language team there is a specificity that must be considered.  This applies not only to the features of the IT infrastructure, but also to building communication with users. <br><br>  Being engaged in several years of written and oral translations, you begin to understand how important it is to be able to correctly build communication, to formulate a question, to distinguish basic and secondary information.  And when it comes to the need for regular practical application of accumulated skills, it immediately brings tremendous benefits. <br><br>  On an internship at the Mars Service Desk such a need arose every day.  Helping users around the world, I radically improved my communication skills: the number of received calls and calls to Skype gradually grows into quality.  You understand that, looking at the work of other guys. <br><br>  Their ability to work on several tasks at the same time is also very inspiring.  At the beginning of the internship, watching them, I was shocked.  How can you quickly switch from one task to another, and then return to the previous one without losing the essence of the problem?  It was felt that in the head of each member of the team is built a clear system of prioritization.  For me, it caused only a sense of admiration. <br><br>  I also liked the friendliness of the whole IT hub of Mars.  Here you can calmly approach anyone, consult or ask for help.  It is at such moments that you feel part of a big team. <br><br>  Every intern in Mars has a mentor (Buddy Mentor).  In addition, trainees, as well as ordinary employees of the company, regularly communicate with their line managers in the form of a personal meeting.  They discuss possible problems and their solutions.  And it also impressed me. <br><br>  The interns at Mars also have their own community - both common to the whole company, and our small but powerful community of the IT hub of Stupino.  There were only four of us, we had internships in different teams, but common projects and communication outside the walls of Mars united us into a separate team. <br><br>  Communicating with other interns, you realize that everyone is in the process of transformation.  But most importantly, we all felt that Mars believed in us, and this is not only self-confidence, but also a powerful impetus to further development. <br><br>  <b>Nami Jain, Service Control Center:</b> <br><br>  May is almost over, and with it is my allergy.  I was already anticipating walks and carefree vacations that were painless for my eyes, accompanied by the assurances of my mother that I was actively ‚Äúlooking for work for the summer.‚Äù  Periodic campaigns for career events and various hackathons / case-championships helped to maintain the legend that ‚Äúso far no luck‚Äù. <br><br>  The only factor that I did not take into account - head hunters.  On some hackathons, these people approached me and were interested in my plans.  Among them was the representative of "Mars".  As a result, a couple of weeks after this meeting, I ended up in the company's office, which is located in Stupino, Moscow Region. <br><br>  The open space of Mars struck me with its scale.  Perhaps I have not visited many places yet, but even in the Kaspersky office there was no such open space.  The second pleasant impression is chocolates available without restrictions.  In general, everything that a student needs with the soul of a seventh grader was before my eyes. <br><br>  While I was looking around, I was introduced to half of the IT hub of Mars.  However, I could remember all my new colleagues only after I began my work and began to associate people with their areas of responsibility. <br><br>  I was told who does what, why our teams are needed and how they are interrelated.  As a result, when I first found myself in my workplace, I already had an idea about what I would do and where to go to solve these or other issues. <br><br>  I trained in the Service Control Center team.  She is responsible for maintaining and upgrading global applications.  Honestly, before that, I very little understood how this sphere of IT works.  I used to think that all IT specialists are divided into coders and sisadmins, without thinking about such things as support and analytics at all.  And this is exactly what I did most of the internship. <br><br>  I began to dive into new technologies and knowledge with such enthusiasm that I hadn‚Äôt noticed for a long time.  I had some kind of subconscious vision of the whole scale of what is happening right here, around me.  I wanted to become a full-fledged part of this process and - most importantly - all the people around me only helped me with this. <br><br>  This is another moment that inspired and reassured me, a person with little experience and great fears of the ‚Äúterrible adult world‚Äù.  Here you do not just do not interfere with development, but, on the contrary, they really want it.  And for this there is everything you need: a lot of training, a library and a friendly team. <br><br>  I want to write about the third component in more detail.  There is a feeling that you are in one huge team, which is moving towards a common goal.  Therefore, no one will refuse to help you when it is needed.  And we need help all the time, because it is very difficult to assimilate so much new information on your own, and it is even more difficult to apply something that you have learned. <br><br>  The atmosphere, as they say here, ‚Äúat the hub‚Äù, is completely ‚Äúnon-tense‚Äù.  You can be not only colleagues, but also friends, and not always you need to separate these two roles.  At some point, I had the feeling that we are all volunteers from the university trade union of students who organize a major event for a huge number of participants. <br>  Integration into the workflow seemed to me difficult and tense only at the very beginning.  In the early days of the internship, I looked with horror at the incredible number of meetings that appeared on my calendar, and was afraid of missing something and falling behind the schedule. <br>  Just a few days later it went away.  It turned out that you can do everything without stress and emotional burnout.  And I can honestly say that in such a short time I was able to plunge into this world and become a full-fledged member of the team.  At least, I got the impression. <br><br>  So, if you want to try something new, meet interesting people, and in the meantime eat plenty of chocolates (and for me this is still one of the significant factors), then come to Mars for an internship. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/429246/">https://habr.com/ru/post/429246/</a></p>
