She was told by the father of a boy who studies in the lower grades.  The boy brought home a strange task: to write what the connection between the bull and the letter ‚ÄúA‚Äù asked the parent to help. <br><br>  My father began to explain that the letter "A" came from the Western Semitic language.  She denoted a bull and portrayed it with her own inscription.  To date, the similarities can be seen, simply turning the title of the Cyrillic "A".  The boy wrote everything down and carried it to school.  As it turned out, the teacher gave him a deuce, with the remark: "so as not to invent."  All that was required of the students was to guess that the ‚Äúbull‚Äù in the genitive case is written ‚Äúbull‚Äù.

      At the end of the recording, the discouraged parent rightly remarks: ‚Äúnow I have to explain to my son at this age that many of the people around him are idiots‚Äù. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The case with the father proves that even school teachers sometimes pose a danger to the child, both mental and intellectual.  We cannot demarcate a child from the outside world without harming its development, on the other hand, the environment can also play a cruel joke: the influence of disadvantaged children, deviant behavior, etc. <br><br>  Another problem is the influence of the media.  Thanks to the achievements of the sexual revolution, videos with erotic content or sexual connotations have become not just accessible, but also widespread in the field of broadcasting.  Playing on the internal sexual mechanisms of a person is one of the most effective marketing moves that most advertising companies do not disdain. <br><br>  On the other hand, Hollywood has long ago introduced and expanded the ideas of permissiveness and value inflation.  It is hard to imagine that even in the fifties, death on the screen shocked the viewer.  Today, the murder is demonstrated even in a joking context. <br><br>  Sexual content suppresses the psyche of the child, which may subsequently affect his psychological health.  Violence does not necessarily put the gun in the hands (although this happens), however, it underestimates the ethical criteria that develop in children from school age, reduces the core values ‚Äã‚Äãto a minimum. <br><br>  And if it is very difficult to limit the child from influence outside the home, then modern technologies allow to effectively filter the content of media information. <br><br>  Technology <a href="http://www.ovivo.tv/ru/get_ovivo/">OViVO</a> is a set-top box for the TV.  It connects to the Internet and generates content for each member of your family, dividing the video received from the network database by profiles.  The profile is set up within a few minutes, after which the device will gradually ‚Äústudy‚Äù the viewer and offer the programs that he prefers to see. <br><br>  You can freely control the information that the child reads, getting rid of violence, erotic content, propaganda of cigarettes and alcohol on the screen. <br><br>  Instead, the technology offers a wide collection of cartoons and fairy tales for children.  The children's profile allows you to set up educational games so that the child not only entertains, but also learns the world, broadens the mind, acquiring basic human values. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.ovivo.tv/ru/get_ovivo/">OViVO</a> selects only the best for children, ranging from classic animation: Norstein, Petrov, ending with the most modern and fun cartoons.  Good-natured, colorful and fascinating, picked up children's programs and cartoons not only elevate the mood of your child, but also have a great contribution to his moral development. <br><br>  Due to the fact that the console learns the preferences of the viewer, in this case, your child, and selects only the information that he likes more, the child not only expands the range of their interests, but also progressively deepens knowledge in a certain area.  The main task of parents at this stage is to accurately recognize the innate predisposition of their child.  After all, as you know, there are no incompetent children, only inattentive parents. <br><br>  By studying the profile of your child, you can accurately determine which branch of knowledge is closer to him.  Perhaps this technique, design and mathematics.  Or your child is prone to imagination and creativity ... You have a chance to recognize talents in order to make every effort to develop them.  Monitoring the profile will be completely invisible to the child, and he will not be tormented by the thoughts that he is controlled. <br><br>  Sooner or later, children face the unsightly side of life.  This can not be avoided.  However, it is in your hands the chance to prepare them, forming a solid ethical and mental base.  And <a href="http://ovivo.tv/ru/get_ovivo/">OViVO</a> technology will help you cope with this difficult task. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/150421/">https://habr.com/ru/post/150421/</a></p>
