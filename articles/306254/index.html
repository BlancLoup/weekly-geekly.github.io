The essence of the event - in one day to get the widest possible view of the market of data centers in St. Petersburg.  This time, we, the <a href="http://linkmeup.ru/">Linkmeup</a> fighters, <a href="http://linkmeup.ru/">also</a> managed to infiltrate the <a href="http://linkmeup.ru/">tour</a> . <br><br>  But just spending the whole day on contemplation of server fields is boring, so this time the trip was more thematic.  Four data centers, each was created to solve specific problems, is aimed at a specific audience of customers and is endowed with its own specific engineering solutions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e2b/187/963/e2b187963e3943068759238bd2e47a52.JPG"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Previous races were organized in the format of ‚ÄúBrilliance and poverty of data centers in St. Petersburg‚Äù and showed everything: from the very thrash data centers to the ‚Äúluxury‚Äù segment.  But so far they have decided against this format, for it is too fast and superficial. <br>  Data Center Expedition PRO aims to show the city‚Äôs data center market in one day, as not many people know it.  Therefore, it was decided that less is better, but better. <br>  And during the excursion tour, entertained by the fascinating stories the honored and legendary telecom operator of St. Petersburg, Dmitry Petrov, part-time director of Comfortel.

    <h4>  <b>Few common words</b> </h4><br>  Let's first agree on what a data center is in order to speak the same language.  So, the data center is not a room where the racks are standing, but an engineering facility in which conditions are created for the uninterrupted power supply of a given quality, at least two power inputs, a set of UPS and a diesel generator with auto start.  Also, strict temperature conditions are ensured and there is a fire extinguishing system, the operation of which does not stop the operation of the placed equipment.  And it is quite good when a vigilant server security guard sits at the entrance, and there are at least two engineers and a power engineer in the monitoring around the clock. <br>  The choice of options for the implementation of these requirements lies solely on the shoulders of the owner and depends on the goals that they set for themselves at the design stage. <br><br>  All the data centers in the review are claimed as Tier 3, but there is a nuance - in St. Petersburg there is not a single certified Tier 3 DC.  Not at all.  As soon as you ask to show a certificate, they all go to the unconscious, mumbling something about the high cost of certification, empty formalities, but full compliance with the requirements.  That is, they, as it were, are ready, but no. <br><br>  And finally: the area, power and other fascinating figures, this is very important and interesting, but you can look at them at any time on the site, so this article will be just personal impressions of each object, with a certain claim to objectivity. <br>  So not all the data center that was called the data center and not all that data center where Tier 3 was written. <br><br><h4>  <b>Linxdatacenter</b> </h4><br>  So, the first in our path was the Linxdatacenter data center.  Representation of the distinguished Dutch company Linxtelecom with data centers and communication channels around the world.  At the opening of the data center came already the Prime Minister of Holland himself.  They claim that they work without failures from the moment of opening, i.e.  already 5 years.  Known for coming to the data center market when no one else in the country knew what it was. <br>  Of interesting technical solutions: its own gas piston substation and, as a result, independence from urban electricity.  Naturally there is a backup input from the city, batteries on the pickup and diesel in case of gas interruptions.  Cooled by freecooling.  Post ready 1000 racks. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4ec/b32/c55/4ecb32c559804eef8f8cd55c9dd15db1.JPG"><br>  <font color="#999999"><i>The prize for the most beautiful building, clearly, at Linxdatacenter</i></font> <br><br>  The data center was built inside the Sky Trade Technopark building, i.e.  there are offices on the right, on the left, on the bottom and in general everywhere.  But linx fenced off from all the thick walls.  By the way, the entrance to the technopark for an unknown reason is located exactly on the opposite side from the entrance, i.e.  as if behind the building. <br>  The main impression: expensive, rich and very corporate.  It is really big, beautiful, it works only with legal entities and evaluates its services in euros.  Although the crisis does not spare anyone and prices have been lowered, but still remain above average in the market. <br><br>  Another feature is remoteness.  Technically, this is a city, even though its very outskirts.  And the industrial zone, surrounded by residential areas, and this traffic jams every morning and evening.  But there are only two large data centers that can accommodate a really large customer.  These are Linx and SDN, both of which are in the north, only SDN is located directly on the Ring Road.  In short, the choice is not particularly necessary. <br>  The status of the institution is maintained here from the doorstep: you will be greeted by beautiful girls, referred to here as commercial representatives, taken to an excellent meeting room, filled with delicious coffee and fed with excellent cookies.  While we were busy with food, the girls organized a survey presentation on the topic of where and how many data centers were already built, what are the communication channels between them, where there are points for connection and other marketing things with high numbers.  The network is really big, and there are a lot of points of presence.  If you have a business in several countries - you are here. <br>  Do not forget the list of the most famous clients.  The list is very solid.  I think that 90% of companies are familiar to any man in the street in one form or another. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7b8/82d/8b8/7b882d8b84c34f2d8a18b5c0a4eb0f62.JPG"><br>  <font color="#999999"><i>When they do not give to remove the technique, you have to remove the cookies</i></font> <br><br>  Before transferring us to the courageous hands of our colleagues for a further excursion, we were handed a standard bag of advertising leaflets and a cute little flash drive.  And here I wondered: is it advisable in 2016 in the data center, which is actively promoting cloud services, to spend the marketing budget on flash drives?  If the pieces of paper can at least theoretically play, then will I use this flash drive at least once, and, in general, where is it now? <br>  But this is all the lyrics.  And we say goodbye to the girls and head to the depth of the data center.  But then a nuisance happens - to shoot inside, even common plans, we were forbidden.  So carefully protect the secrets of their customers.  And it‚Äôs a pity, because inside the equipment was found that not every engineer saw close to him, even if he regularly attends specialized exhibitions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5ee/6ae/7ff/5ee6ae7ffd114c9e8bca022a7f4a6e7b.JPG"><br>  <font color="#999999"><i>Behind this turntable is all the most interesting, but you can't</i></font> <br><br>  In general, the secrets of their customers here are very scrupulous!  If necessary, it is possible to isolate not just with standard lattices with a lock, but with a blind fence into the ceiling, a fence under the raised floor, biometric sensors at the entrance, a ban on passage for everyone except their engineers, who are planted here in a separate room and watch everything along isolated network video surveillance.  It lacks only minefields and machine gun towers.  But seriously, this approach inspires genuine respect.  I think that for the financial sector and just a large enterprise, the possibility of such a circular defense can be a decisive factor. <br>  There was a surprise in the motocross room: a robot vacuum cleaner was cleaning the house.  We decided that the cleaning mop bears an unreasonably high risk compared to the robot from Karcher.  Although the cross-over itself looks dull: unforgivably few operators. <br><br><h6>  As output: </h6>  Linxdatacenter I associate with an expensive restaurant.  Everything is formalized and regulated, from beginning to end, without the right to make mistakes.  You go here, when you know exactly what you want, you are always sure of the result at the exit, you will never be afraid to come here with business partners, and therefore you are ready to pay for all of the above.  But if you suddenly want to eat simple pasta with butter, then no matter how much you wallow in the legs of the waitress, nobody will cook you, because  they have standards, rules that control instances, hellish bureaucracy and, God forbid, whoever sees how their cook a Frenchman cooks Shchebekin‚Äôs macaroni instead of fusilli or at least zitti.  But the crisis is a crisis, and simple makaroshki are becoming closer and more accessible. <br><br><h4>  <b>Miran</b> </h4><br>  Another well-deserved player in the St. Petersburg data center market, launched a little earlier than Linxdatacenter.  Located near the city center, consists of two parts.  The first part is a classic data center, and we will not dwell on it for long. <br>  The second part is a modular data center, it is being actively built, and the first module was relatively recently commissioned. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/22c/a06/a5a/22ca06a5a72e4a7b9939a872b0a0bb8a.JPG"><br><br>  The data center actively plays both its location and its history.  By the way, the number of telecom operators here is 4 times more than in Linxdatacenter, and even the purely visual location of the communications center looks extremely solid.  Operators are happy about this state of affairs, so feel free to install powerful core-level iron and aggregation.  There is even a trunk hub in place, and a lot of cables are wound up by different routes, i.e.  We can safely say that from the very beginning Miran was oriented towards friendship with the operators, and clearly did not lose.  For many current customers, the ability to connect to a diverse operator has become the most important argument in choosing a location. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fef/460/b53/fef460b5323d4f8daef34224c34f2395.JPG"><br>  <font color="#999999"><i>The classic division into a hot / cold corridor.</i></font>  <font color="#999999"><i>Everywhere is bright and clean</i></font> <br><br>  Separately, I want to say about security.  The Miranovites themselves joke that the main pillar of their security is the difficulty of finding a data center.  Their building is so cleverly hidden in the back streets of the industrial zone since tsarist Russia, that until you know where to go, it's better not to go.  Judge for yourself: <br>  - We go in inconspicuous arch, <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/16b/348/3be/16b3483be24245a3a0b6545d485b402b.JPG"><br><br>  - We pass through the hangar built in the near-wartime, <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/734/a08/71a/734a0871a62845ec85a02b4ba31e330f.JPG"><br><br>  - We pass by the building of the first furniture factory in Russia (namely, the factory, and not the simple manufactory), <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/39b/1a8/916/39b1a8916654452aa972cfdd643c38f0.JPG"><br><br>  - We continue to walk past the workshops of Ludwig Nobel (the brother of the founder of the award itself, the most famous engineer and in fact the founder of the oil industry in Russia) <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2a3/545/444/2a354544462441159de6a8c357fe5e79.JPG"><br><br>  - Around the corner we stumble on a hefty diesel. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/17f/6e3/dc3/17f6e3dc31f34fbb86deeacb09880ac7.JPG"><br><br>  Guess who?  By the way, why is he standing on wheels - if he is removed from the frame and put on the ground, then it will be necessary to carry out additional registration and coordination work, which no one needs.  Therefore, as brought, so in that position and recorded. <br><br>  And while we rub a bruised knee, we accidentally notice a modest tablet somewhere at the roof level. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/321/1d6/0c1/3211d60c1a35414c886cb449d9e25d6b.JPG"><br><br>  But back to the structure of this data center.  In fact, these are two different data centers located in the same place and in the same hands.  The first one is a data center of classical fate and design: we take a building, constructively strengthen it and rebuild it in a data center with a freon cooling system.  Although on the tour it was stated the use of free cooling with all the consequences. <br>  The second part is much more interesting: it is created by progressive modular technology.  In place of this, it means that in a huge factory hangar, specially designed module modules are installed, each of which is engaged in its own business.  In some there are racks, in others cooling, etc.  At the moment, only one module is fully launched, the second one is being actively mounted, and there should be four of them altogether.  All development from and to custom. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/eb6/6bf/a5d/eb66bfa5d1ca4321bb5cc19429f54a72.JPG"><br>  <font color="#999999"><i>Lawlessness racks.</i></font>  <font color="#999999"><i>But they are clearly struggling with him - before it was much worse</i></font> <br><br>  Modules are specially welded double-decker containers, similar to standard sea containers.  On the first floor there are racks, air conditioning units and a fire extinguishing system, on the second floor - a power unit, UPS, and so on.  Everything is controlled by clever automatics, which, for example, can supply cold air to specific heating points, rather than simply increasing the air flow throughout the module. <br>  The hangar in which they are located, naturally underwent special training.  Ceremonial works were carried out, powerful exhaust fans and passive coarse filters were installed under the ceiling, which change regularly.  Thus, the air in the room gets relatively clean and at the entrance to the system of free cooling passes only fine cleaning.  It is argued that such a modular solution is unique to St. Petersburg. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/535/43b/ca5/53543bca5f3b4bfa8e14f1b48f7b15b5.JPG"><br>  <font color="#999999"><i>Here we have put things in order and actively support it.</i></font> <br><br>  By the way, the excursion here is led not by effective salesmen, but by engineers.  Perhaps this is why Miran leaves the impression of a warm, lamp and some kind of home institution. <br>  Miran is also known for the fact that once, after five years of uptime, he lay down completely, from a word altogether, for endless 30 minutes.  But, as you know, there is no bad PR, and the way the data center management behaved in this sad situation brought them the reputation of partners willing to take full responsibility for their jambs, rather than trying to sneak away from it somehow. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7b5/5cc/d8e/7b55ccd8e8684591a843e3304a868315.JPG"><br>  <font color="#999999"><i>Modular data center.</i></font>  <font color="#999999"><i>The far module is already running, the short-run is in commissioning.</i></font> <br><br>  Anticipating the question: what exactly happened, I can not say, because  I did not hold a candle, but the story goes to the people: <br>  The new UPS was put into operation.  He was already connected to the inputs, everything was checked and prepared to add to the control software.  Due to the presence of a physical connection to the control system and the lack of it at the logical level, monitoring periodically sprinkled various boring alerts, and the chief engineer, issuing the control center on duty, went home with a light heart, full of ideas tomorrow to let the UPS into battle.  The essence of the issued DDs was as follows: if a certain alert arrives, then you need to go there, find the UPS such and such, go to a certain menu and press reset the error.  Well, then, by itself, the human factor happens - the engineer who came to reset the error, misses the button and presses Load off, i.e.  reset the load.  And everything would be fine, because  the load is not connected to the UPS and you can press anything, but his majesty the case entered the case.  When the UPS is physically connected, but not logically connected, a terrible, but simple as three kopecks of the bug surfaced in the system - Load off came to all the UPS.  At this point, in fact, the engineer himself turned off the entire data center. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/da0/2d2/94c/da02d294cf5d44119b7d275081add19b.JPG"><br>  <font color="#999999"><i>Exhaust fans, human-sized, under the roof of the hangar and electrical cables as thick as the arm</i></font> <br><br>  But further more!  With shaking hands, he dials the chief engineer, describes the situation, and he seems to make the right decision based on the available information: there is no voltage, the diesel engine does not start, it means that the UPS did not work and it is necessary to disconnect the input and start the diesel engine.  The engineer runs to the main switchboard, chops off the gaps and utters the main phrase of the evening: ‚ÄúOh, and now the light is gone‚Äù, to which he gets a reasonable question ‚ÄúHas he been?  You said there is nothing at all! ‚ÄùAnd a bunch of words after the ability to describe the situation.  The unfortunate engineer in pre-infarction condition was sent to calm down and only then continued to figure out what is, what is not, and how to turn everything back on.  This is how the combination of the factor of chance and human error cost half an hour of idle time. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5ee/cb0/c07/5eecb0c077414e6c85da3c742a0a6b33.JPG"><br>  <font color="#999999"><i>Inside the module everything is very spartan and functional.</i></font> <br><br><h6>  As output: </h6>  In my opinion, engineering and functional, Miran is a very worthy place.  Adding here the economic component, we get a good option in terms of price-quality ratio.  But if appearance is also important to you and there is no desire to scour the old workshops and existing production, then, alas, you are definitely not here.  On the other hand, if you are ready to believe a lot of positive reviews about, perhaps, the most famous data center of the city, then you definitely here. <br><br><h4>  <b>IMAQLIQ</b> </h4><br>  After a delicious lunch, we went to the IMAQLIQ data center.  This data center has the strangest history of appearance and development, despite the fact that it is not inferior in age to the previous two. <br>  For all its existence, it was known as Arroba, CubioRus, IQdata, General Datacomm, and only relatively recently focused on the current version of IMAQLIQ. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c14/ad1/e68/c14ad1e68626477abb0ff1bb64a6aa8b.JPG"><br>  <font color="#999999"><i>Modestly, very modestly ...</i></font> <br><br>  It all started with the company General Datacomm, which is engaged in the development of network equipment.  Especially leaned on the radio relay for mobile operators.  Then they bought the operator Kubio, who tried to impersonate Finnish, which is particularly beneficial in St. Petersburg, because  All communications to Europe go through Finland. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bde/8d1/132/bde8d11326924398b6a8fd3df9fd8299.JPG"><br>  <font color="#999999"><i>All engineering here is done somehow very beautifully and with a soul.</i></font> <br><br>  This is how the company engaged in the creation of equipment for telecoms, quite unexpectedly for all, entered the market of these telecoms.  And in order to completely surprise everyone, they also decided to build a data center, which was alternately named by all names. <br>  Geographically, the General Datacomm assembly workshops are located on the territory of the turbine blade factory.  What does it mean to be located on the territory of the former Soviet factory?  Right!  Huge territory and almost unlimited electricity.  Therefore, the data center is built under the same roof with a warehouse and to say that there is less space there, it is just brazenly lying.  Previously, they knew how to build from the heart and did not hold back on a scale. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2cf/d83/134/2cfd83134b224c71979a212b02fdff80.JPG"><br>  <font color="#999999"><i>Free space inside - at least play football</i></font> <br><br>  But back to the history of the data center.  He did not receive a strong impetus to development, and, apparently, the secondary importance of this business line for the founders of the parent company is to blame.  Therefore, its development until recently was extremely non-linear and in fits and starts.  But now, having passed the way from just a large server to a complete engineering object, this data center is clearly beginning to gain momentum. <br>  In places this means the following: the data center is now almost empty, and there is an active phase of finding customers, which means more than reasonable prices and the willingness to make concessions, which you will never agree to elsewhere.  All major operators have already logged in, so there is no problem with communication. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a66/dec/298/a66dec29893040a2bdab2eea37122c3a.JPG"><br>  <font color="#999999"><i>Audience Award, for MSW with the coolest views is awarded IMAQLIQ</i></font> <br><br>  Pleasantly surprised by the attitude to the reservation of electricity.  The local engineers have the main principle: the guaranteed power supply is the one that we issue from the UPS and diesel, and everything else is a reserve.  In practice, this means the presence of MSB with very solid cabinets and racks of batteries.  Just the guys themselves offered to start a diesel engine that would show the output to the operating mode in 15 seconds.  While we were going to the diesel engine, we were told how the fuel suppliers are being checked - they just call them at the most inconvenient moment of time and ask when they can bring the right amount of fuel.  If the answer does not suit (and it happens that just no one answers), then they no longer work with this supplier. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0d5/431/48e/0d543148e4dd4ce782aaa146e7ed8c18.JPG"><br>  <font color="#999999"><i>Slowly customers fill the area</i></font> <br><br><h6>  As output: </h6>  This data center, as it is now, I call for myself the data center for storing backups, i.e.  a place where you can already come, but somehow it‚Äôs scary to be the first to bring serious equipment, because the place is new and has not survived all the youth problems.  But to drag here a nonsense to write backups on ribbons or some other archive server, which seems to be necessary, but in fact just takes place in the racks - a nice thing.  Usually, the firm is in any kind of medium something that is not very important and that it would be desirable to move to a remote site.  But it is clear that the guys are actively developing, working and developing plans for them are ambitious, so hurry to see.  All the makings of a serious player in the market data centers they have.  Let's see what time will tell. <br><br><h4>  <b>Bonch Aichi</b> </h4><br>  Definitely the most unusual of the sites visited.  But in order for the story about her to be understandable, it is necessary to step aside and turn to the historical place of the Internet power of St. Petersburg - Bolshaya Morskaya 18. <br>  BM18 - located at the University of Industrial Technology and Design, historically the largest traffic exchange point in the city.  Only the operators here are about 120, and the number of cables, fibers and communication organization possibilities is absolutely beyond limit.  This was mainly due to the geographical location - the most central center of the city.  Directly opposite the main headquarters arch, two minutes walk from the Winter Palace, etc.  But besides its obvious enormous significance for local telecoms, it is also known for the regularity of the arising problems of different levels of adequacy.  Among the most famous are the flood from above, then the flood from below, we do not forget about the fire and the unfortunate electrician who cut down the connection in half of the city for disabled porn, etc.  The main reason is that BM18 is located in a federal university, therefore, especially to invest in the infrastructure of not its building, naturally, no one wants, and from here there are numerous jambs.
