  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Payoneer: not only cards</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Summer is over and holidays, and by the number of calls to the support service, we see that freelancers are back to work. <br><br>  Today we would like to share Payoneer's news over the past summer months. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Previously, we offered only prepaid cards, but our goal is to offer users the widest choice of opportunities so that everyone can receive their earned money in the way that suits them best.  Despite the fact that over the past 6 years, the Payoneer card has proven to be a reliable and fast way to transfer money, we would not want to limit our customers to only one way to earn their earnings.  Working in this direction, several months ago we started offering our partner companies to make payments to virtual cards.  Unlike conventional plastics, a virtual card does not require a physical delivery procedure and can be made available to the user much faster than a regular one.  Like a regular plastic card, a virtual card is suitable for shopping online or by phone.  The main disadvantage is that it cannot be paid off-line or, for example, withdraw cash from an ATM.  According to our idea, a virtual Payoneer card should be suitable for those who receive small transfers;  those who do not want to wait for a plastic card to be delivered or those who are used to using the card exclusively for online purchases. <br><br>  But what if the payments to the card are not satisfied in principle?  Payoneer is often approached by executives of small software development companies, design studios, translation outsourcing agencies, etc.  with a request to help them get money from freelance exchanges or large agencies.  Often, these companies can not use our cards because  they pay their employees by transferring salaries to a bank account or a local bank card.  For such situations, we offer our partner companies a new bank transfer service, directly to the bank account of a freelancer / small company.  In most countries, transfers are made in local currency.  This service was launched about a year ago and first covered some countries in Europe and North America.  Over the past year, we have connected additional regions (Asia, South America, and Eastern Europe) and quite recently began to carry out ruble bank transfers to banks in Russia and dollar transfers in Ukraine.

      As in the case of virtual cards, as well as with local bank transfers, the decision to enter additional payment methods is in the hands of the partner company.  So, if you are not satisfied with the withdrawal of funds for plastic, ask your employer to connect virtual cards and bank transfers. <br><br>  By tradition, we recall the address of the Russian-speaking support: support (a) payoneer.ru and the Russian-language service working with partners: sales (a) payoneer.ru. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/129183/">https://habr.com/ru/post/129183/</a></p>
