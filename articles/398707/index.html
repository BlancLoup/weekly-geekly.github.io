  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Myths and Reality: What you need to know about modern audio systems</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The sound industry, about which everyone had heard in the 80s, was almost completely out of sight of the media with the exception of a number of specialized publications.  Unfortunately, today people who are not related to the audio industry do not even know about the possibilities offered by new audio technologies.  From here comes a lot of myths that have developed around modern audio systems. <br><br>  In Audiomania, we <a href="http://www.audiomania.ru/mirhifi/">share our experience</a> with everyone who is interested in this topic, talk about audio technology and give the opportunity to receive information "first-hand."  Our company has chosen for itself the following motto: ‚Äúgood sound from A to Z‚Äù;  so we will try to speak in simple words, give answers to basic questions and introduce you to the world of modern audio technology. <br><br> <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/audiomania/blog/282058/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bdf/d12/c9d/bdfd12c9d20b4404ba5e66df6f96365b.jpg"></a> <br>  <i>Photo <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/slgc/">PRODennis Skley Follow</a> / <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/2.0/">CC</a></i> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  What parameters need to be considered when choosing audio systems? </h2><br>  There is an opinion that sound quality directly depends on the price or frequency range of one or another audio system.  Many people are surprised that on the <a href="http://www.audiomania.ru/naushniki/">site of Audiomania</a> we refused to compare acoustics and headphones for performance.  The fact is that it is practically useless.

      Of course, when choosing, you can pay attention to the frequency range, power and resistance, but the headphones, like the speakers, have dozens of different parameters.  Trying to put them all in my head and compare - the task of an amateur. <br><br>  In a situation where we compare only the frequency characteristics and price, it may turn out that a relatively cheap column reproduces a larger frequency range than the expensive one.  However, if we look at the curve of amplitude-frequency characteristics (AFC), on what frequencies and how are reproduced, the picture will be different. <br><br>  Does this mean that you are guaranteed to enjoy the sound of very expensive acoustics?  The answer to this question you need to find yourself.  On practice. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9f8/116/601/9f811660167d415c95c5c7fb0cf9653d.JPG"><br>  <i><a href="http://www.audiomania.ru/content/art-4.html">Schorum Audiomania on m. Electrozavodskaya</a></i> <br><br>  You should not make a choice, relying only on advertising or the opinion of other people, since the requirements for the sound of certain works are different.  Before you buy audio equipment, you need to check it in your work - listen to your favorite music, the sound of which you know well. <br><br>  Unfortunately, ordinary stores usually do not provide such services.  For this purpose, special showrooms have been created where you can listen to the chosen audio system in comfortable conditions. <br><br><h2>  Do I need to buy professional audio equipment for home use? </h2><br>  Many lovers of good sound mistakenly believe that professional audio equipment is ‚Äúbetter‚Äù and should cost more than amateur.  In fact, everything is a little different, and the ‚Äúprofessional‚Äù audio equipment is called not because it compares favorably with something, but from the word ‚Äúprofession‚Äù. <br><br>  How can you quickly determine whether a particular system is "professional"?  For example, in appearance: professional speakers and equipment rarely have designer delights, and in their decoration, as a rule, do not use expensive materials. <br><br>  It is possible to accurately determine the class to which the equipment belongs, by using the connectors and connectors used.  For example, <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speakon">Speakon connectors</a> are used primarily in professional audio systems.  Round on the outside, they are completely different from those familiar terminals and clamping pads, which are mainly used for home speakers. <br><br>  The point is the load, which is designed for one or another technique.  Remember any shop, restaurant or fitness club - there is always music playing.  For such tasks, professional equipment is used, which provide for a constant load. <br><br>  Here you should pay attention to the power systems.  If you need to voice a large space - you need more power.  If we are talking about a small room, then we can restrict ourselves to wall speakers. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dcb/31d/81a/dcb31d81a0354dc08434800ef2cafe9c.png" width="500"></div><br>  <i><a href="http://www.audiomania.ru/ready/club_bar_restaraunt.html">Our solutions for indoor background sound</a></i> <br><br>  Public address systems or equipment for evening events are significantly different from home audio equipment.  Both in its tasks and in terms of parameters and character of sound. <br><br>  Unlike professional systems, modern Hi-Fi is not designed for permanent work and requires different operating conditions, although with normal home use such systems can work without loss of quality for up to 20 years. <br><br>  Few would want to risk their home audio system and use it outdoors.  For this task there are special waterproof and frost-resistant speakers. <br><br><blockquote>  <i>An example of such a system: <a href="http://www.audiomania.ru/vsepogodnaya_akustika/tannoy/tannoy_dvs_4.html">all-weather acoustics Tannoy DVS 4</a></i> </blockquote><br>  They can even be made in the form of stones and used to decorate the landscape.  Moreover, such systems operate in any weather all year round. <br><br><h2>  Why do we need headphone amplifiers? </h2><br>  It is worth remembering that high sound quality depends not only on headphones.  Even the best of them are not able to provide decent sound without a high-quality source and amplifier.  Smartphones and laptops are usually equipped with low-power amplifiers and, with rare exceptions, are not able to provide truly high-quality sound through the standard output. <br><br>  The signal from such devices can be enhanced, especially if you prefer full-size stereo headphones.  In addition, some of the amplifiers contain controls such as, for example, a volume control.  Thus, you do not need to take the smartphone out of your pocket every time to turn down the sound or answer a call. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/527/386/2eb/5273862eb9be4307ae153ce893dfaace.jpg" width="300"></div><br>  <i><a href="http://www.audiomania.ru/dac/arcam/arcam_rpac.html">External DAC Arcam rPac</a></i> <br><br>  There are also amplifiers with built-in digital-to-analog converters (DACs), that is, hybrid devices.  On the street, they can be used as a sound amplifier, and at home, when connected to a computer, as a sound card.  External DACs are convenient because they can be connected to any device that has a digital output, and <a href="http://www.audiomania.ru/dac/">most DACs</a> can also be connected via USB. <br><br><h2>  Can intracanal headphones be harmful to health? </h2><br>  It should be immediately noted that the fact of using headphones does not harm the organs of hearing.  This is a myth, because in that case earplugs, working noise protection headphones, and thick caps that put pressure on the auricle area would be harmful. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/50c/804/6e0/50c8046e0e5c41fc9c1985b94de11ae1.jpg" width="300"></div><br>  <i><a href="http://www.audiomania.ru/in_ear_headphones/fischer_audio/fischer_audio_leggiero.html">Intra-channel Fischer Audio Leggiero headphones in ebony</a></i> <br><br>  Potential damage from headphones may be due to the loudness of the transmitted sound: <br><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúIndeed, if you use in-ear headphones, not in-channel, in the subway, add volume, but also connect the amplifier,‚Äú swinging ‚Äùit to the fullest, then there is a risk to weaken your hearing, because the body will defend itself.  - says <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/timshick/">Timofey Shikolenkov</a> , director of marketing and business development for Audiomania.  - Loud sounds are very harmful to the ears, much more harmful than any imaginary problems that may arise in the process of putting on or wearing headphones. </blockquote><br>  However, many are convinced that small in-ear headphones do not have a deep and high-quality bass by definition.  In fact, there are many devices that prove the opposite. <br><br><blockquote>  <i>For example: <a href="http://www.audiomania.ru/in_ear_headphones/denon/denon_ah-c101.html">Denon AH-C101 in-ear headphones</a></i> </blockquote><br>  <i>PS Many of the myths found their answers in the issues of our thematic program ‚Äú <a href="http://www.audiomania.ru/mirhifi/podcasts/">Sound</a> ‚Äù, and we promptly <a href="http://www.audiomania.ru/faq/">answer the</a> clients' direct questions in a special section on our website.</i> <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">If interesting</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Our GT Audio Digest: <br><br><ul><li>  [ <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/audiomania/blog/281412/"># 11: Analog and movie sound</a> ] </li><li>  [ <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/audiomania/blog/281152/"># 10: Interviews, Vinyl and Guides</a> ] </li><li>  [ <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/audiomania/blog/279962/"># 9: Tips for music lovers and "do it yourself"</a> ] </li></ul><br></div></div></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/398707/">https://habr.com/ru/post/398707/</a></p>
