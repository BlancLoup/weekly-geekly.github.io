      To begin with, the atmosphere of terrible crimes is intensified with gloomy pictures of fartschikov.  The company, so respected by me, throws off the 6,000,000 pages found in Yandex ( <a href="http://yandex.ru/yandsearch%3Ftext%3D%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%2520%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B6%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B9%26lr%3D2">search results</a> ) to the underground business with a light kick, although advertising of HP original cartridges is still displayed in this search. <br><br>  Then, users crushed by the fact that they all refer to a measly 4% will find out that: <br><ul><li>  <i>Of the 168 remanufactured black toner cartridges that took part in the test, 51 had one or another shortcoming, for example, faults that were immediately noticeable upon removal from the package, premature failure to work, or mass substandard printing</i> ( <a href="http://h41112.www4.hp.com/promo/toner-test/ru/ru/index.html">http://h41112.www4.hp.com /promo/toner-test/ru/ru/index.html</a> ).  But haven't you tried immediately after removing the cartridge from the package to determine the mass substandard printing? <br></li><li>  <i>Given the reliability and quality of the original HP black toner cartridges, it may be less expensive than average recycled black toner cartridges ‚Äî up to 55 percent savings for customers with roughly the same print volumes for external distribution, internal distribution and private use</i> (the same source).  The obvious calculation, everyone agrees? <br></li><li>  <i>According to the study, more than 30 percent of the pages printed using remanufactured black toner cartridges were of insufficient quality or were completely unusable</i> (the source is the same).  Here, too, nothing to comment. <br></li><li>  The study for the Russian market is based on the following data: <i>The HP cost data is based on average figures given in a comparative study of the reliability of monochrome toners conducted by QualityLogic in 2008.</i>  <i>The calculation includes the cost of replacing the cartridges, reprints and the estimated costs of labor.</i>  <i>It is assumed that print volumes for external distribution, internal distribution and private use are about the same.</i>  <i>Labor costs are calculated based on the salary of a secretary and a technician (qualified) in Western Europe based on the Global Pay Summary report of Mercer 2007/2008.</i>  <i>The estimated purchase price of an HP cartridge is 131 euros and the purchase price is 42% lower for a remanufactured cartridge.</i>  <i>Actual prices, costs and savings may vary.</i>  And yet different!  In 2010, we are offered to calculate the costs based on the pre-crisis European rates! </li></ul><br>  Statistics cause no more questions, but emotions, because it seems useless to ask questions, and everyone knows the answers to them. <br><br>  As always, marketing ignores all possible reasonable objections, building a one-sided value system.  Probably, this justifies the money invested, although I want to believe that the market will make its own adjustments and the shift in emphasis will make the major players reconsider their positions, it only remains to be surprised, hasn‚Äôt the experience of confronting Google and Microsoft models taught you anything? <br><br>  Of the more outspoken blunders, the listings of three points surprised, two of which are identical.  Also, the press service, feeling a clear lack of justification for calculating the percentage of users using refilled cartridges, transmitted this information to various media without risking to post such calculations on the official website. <br><br>  I do not urge anyone to ignore the preferred use of original consumables, but I am sure that in the future those vendors will win, who will take care of users a little more than of themselves. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/95093/">https://habr.com/ru/post/95093/</a></p>
