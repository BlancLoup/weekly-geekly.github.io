  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Review OnePlus 3: the third generation of the iconic Chinese smartphone</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  OnePlus is the same company that two years ago, from the presentation of its first smartphone, made a real show with competing trolling and sales restriction using the system of invites.  The competitive advantage of the model was the flagship iron at a low cost - about two times cheaper than the leading flagships of that year. <br><br> <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/gearbest/blog/279262/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/996/74d/45d/99674d45de47c127cd67afb7b5d138c2.jpg"></a> <br><br>  It turned out great, but it was not possible to repeat the triumphant appearance of the first model on the market: the following smartphones of the company, the flagship OnePlus 2 and the budget OnePlus X, were not so impressive, so their premiere went without much excitement.  And now the time has come for the trump card: the new OnePlus 3 turned out to be the most productive smartphone at the moment, with a price of less than 30,000 rubles.  An impressive comeback, OnePlus! <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Specifications of OnePlus 3 </h2><br><blockquote>  <b>Screen:</b> Optic AMOLED 5.5 '' 1080x1920 <br>  <b>Processor:</b> Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 2.2 GHz quad-core <br>  <b>Graphics accelerator:</b> Adreno 530 <br>  <b>Operating system:</b> Android 6.0 <br>  <b>RAM:</b> 6 GB <br>  <b>Built-in memory:</b> 64 GB <br>  <b>Memory card support:</b> no <br>  <b>Connectivity:</b> 2G / 3G / 4G <br>  <b>SIM:</b> nanoSIM <br>  <b>Wireless interfaces:</b> Wi-Fi 802.11a / b / g / n / ac, Bluetooth 4.2, NFC <br>  <b>Navigation:</b> GPS <br>  <b>Cameras:</b> main - 16 megapixel (flash, PDAF-autofocus, aperture f / 2.0), front - 8 megapixel <br>  <b>Sensors:</b> accelerometer, gyroscope, ambient light sensor, proximity sensor, Hall sensor, optical stabilizer, digital compass <br>  <b>Battery:</b> 3000 mAh <br>  <b>Dimensions:</b> 153x75x7.35 mm </blockquote><br><blockquote>  <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/cell-phones/pp_363558.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">$ 400 + on Gearbest</a> </blockquote><br><h2>  Equipment </h2><br>  OnePlus 3 packaging is, as always, a simple white brick box with an embossed triple on the lid and the inscription OnePlus 3 on the side faces.  Inside the box is bright red, the same colors are used in the proprietary USB Type-C charging cable.  In addition to the smartphone and the cable, a clip for removing the SIM card, a 4A charger, documentation and two stickers with the company logo and the motto ‚ÄúNever Settle‚Äù were included in the package, which can be translated as ‚ÄúNever agree‚Äù or even ... ‚ÄúEnough endure. "  What is the slogan?  The fact is that the message of the OnePlus marketing campaign is as follows: the main players in the smartphone market do not sell the best quality devices for big money, but OnePlus, on the contrary, offers the best smartphones, and for an adequate price tag.

    <h2>  Appearance and ergonomics </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ec5/5bf/0ee/ec55bf0ee1f37d6707ce39ef35fb16b6.jpg"><br><br>  Compared with the previous generation, the new OnePlus 3 has become 2.5 mm thinner and has acquired a convex 2.5 D glass, thanks to which it began to look and feel more compact and sleeker in the hand.  The back surface is a bit slippery, but not critical: there were no problems with slipping from the hand during testing, sharp ribs contribute to a good ‚Äúgrip‚Äù of the device. <br><br>  An interesting implementation was received by a fingerprint scanner: it is built into the ‚ÄúHome‚Äù button under the screen, but this button does not have a physical stroke, and you cannot press it - it is touch sensitive and requires a regular touch, which at first seems rather unusual. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6c0/1a9/c73/6c01a9c7376992b5d3bb551542d7ac2d.jpg"><br><br>  Since the body is made of aluminum, it was not without plastic strips on the back and side of the smartphone - they are needed for receiving and transmitting the signal.  But the camera prominently protrudes from the body. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d62/821/dd8/d62821dd881f986be5a8b0e30012c45a.jpg"><br><br>  The assembly of OnePlus 3 is very good, dense.  There is no backlash, the case is monolithic, it is not pressed and does not deform.  The power button is located on the right edge, the volume rocker - on the left.  All other connectors are located on the bottom: there is a speaker grille, a USB Type-C connector and a mini-jack (3.5mm). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d98/de4/7fd/d98de47fdd4b3ad2872577e63bbff214.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ea4/d2b/5fc/ea4d2b5fc7da55d50e28d74a904d5993.jpg"><br><br>  On the left edge there is a three-phase switch, with which you can choose one of three alert modes: silent, only priority notifications or all notifications.  He has a clear move and an interesting metal texture, making it pleasant to use them from a tactile point of view. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/34e/117/caa/34e117caac228a89f5a3c788cfb016b5.jpg"><br><br><h2>  Iron </h2><br>  OnePlus 3 got a fresh Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processor and as many as 6 GB of RAM.  Let us leave questions about the appropriateness and necessity of such a volume and simply recognize: this is cool.  The operating system, of course, the latest - Android 6.0.  It is worth noting the excellent speed: Google Play is fast, applications are installed instantly - here also plays the role of high-speed flash memory.  The volume of the drive, by the way, 64 GB.  There is no slot for microSD-cards, but as practice shows, the mentioned volume is more than enough to install a lot of software, including heavy games.  It is noticeable that the programs are installed and opened much faster than on other smartphones, including the flagship ones. <br><br>  I would also like to note the truly flagship speed of response of the system, when at any user action (menu call, pressing a button, launching an application) the reaction occurs very quickly. <br><br>  The Qualcomm proprietary development Adreno 530 was used as a graphics processor. OnePlus 3 games take on five plus, even very demanding ones: you can drive in Asphalt 8 and in Real Racing 3, or run in the Minion Rush 3D runner ‚Äî everywhere a smartphone showed excellent graphics and smooth frame rates. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/523/6a8/076/5236a80760dfdd2a9b329de69813c4eb.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/31e/587/cc4/31e587cc46f68c912e3556ba92ec6050.png"><br><br>  The only minus of OnePlus 3 in terms of performance - is the heating of the case under prolonged loads.  It does not affect performance, but after a while it becomes not very comfortable to use. <br><br>  In synthetic tests, OnePlus shows record results: 140,000 points in AnTuTu - this is more than the popular flagships of the Samsung Galaxy S7 and iPhone 6S. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c60/6df/48f/c606df48f97981b4c4e74a1517a01718.png" width="400"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/352/210/71f/35221071f5c14a7a139daa223916d8aa.png" width="400"><br>  <i><font color="#999999">OnePlus 3 results in AnTuTu</font></i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6cb/843/119/6cb84311921048170d3850a09ec70a40.png" width="400"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bd3/697/532/bd36975329825494ae953d92a9d4c232.png" width="400"><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Test results in the 3DMark gaming benchmark</font></i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/612/2e0/8a9/6122e08a923eba4d1e81aa3844176e14.png" width="260"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e29/0c6/8f2/e290c68f2683c7eb438fdd2495bd886a.png" width="260"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1f4/253/49a/1f425349a4c957530193161dda987690.png" width="260"><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Results in the benchmark Geekbench 3</font></i> <br><br><h2>  Display </h2><br>  The OnePlus 3 display received a 5.5 ‚Ä≥ diagonal, while the developers did not chase the numbers and limited themselves to FullHD resolution, which is more than enough with such a diagonal - the pixel density exceeds 400 dpi, individual pixels are very difficult to discern. <br><br>  The quality of the screen is not inferior to the flagships of other manufacturers - it has a very high brightness (it has to be muffled in the room, as it is too bright), almost perfect viewing angles (when tilting there is only a slight distortion of the color rendition towards the blue hues) and excellent clarity.  The screen colors are saturated, but not excessive.  In the settings it is possible to adjust the color balance and turn on the night mode, in which the display turns yellow - it calms the nervous system and causes less damage to the eyes when using the device in the dark.  It is recommended to turn on this mode before bedtime in order to fall asleep faster. <br><br><h2>  Interface </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a70/07d/727/a7007d727b09e05f142f9a521fff0998.png" width="400"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/684/6a8/6d8/6846a86d8b5478f0592e3f59d8a59635.png" width="400"><br><br>  OnePlus 3 is running the latest version of Android with Oxygen OS firmware version 3.2.2.  It practically does not change the appearance of the interface, but adds many additional settings.  The firmware, by the way, plays an important role in the speed of the smartphone - the smoothness of the interface largely depends on its optimization.  In OnePlus 3, as we have already found out, this is more than order. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7fa/902/86f/7fa90286f5d4272a409d07887191ecf0.png" width="250"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/87c/4e8/729/87c4e87291b67e6aebe2f8291d732c04.png" width="250"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1df/db7/a91/1dfdb7a91a19304912e69f190f5bc663.png" width="250"><br><br><h2>  Fingerprint scanner </h2><br>  Pleased with the speed and fingerprint scanner.  It works by a light touch, including when the screen is off, so unlocking the smartphone when using it takes literally a fraction of a second.  It takes about 10-15 seconds to register a fingerprint; up to five fingerprints can be added to the device‚Äôs memory. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e0a/0fd/54b/e0a0fd54b7cc50fe7ecadfdde1073e60.png" width="500"></div><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/17a/454/daf/17a454daf108d834a3324781b236dc2f.jpg"><br><br><h2>  Camera </h2><br>  The OnePlus 3 main camera module received a 16 megapixel resolution, an f / 2.0 aperture and optical stabilization.  The photos are excellent, especially if you look at them on the screen of the smartphone itself.  When viewed on a large display, however, it is noticeable that in some cases the images lack the dynamic range, as a result of which there are visible dips in the shadows and highlights in the sky.  The rest of the OnePlus 3 perfectly copes with the tasks - it has amazingly fast focus, excellent macro photography and almost perfect color reproduction.  In the photos of closely located objects you can see bokeh, similar to those obtained when shooting on SLR cameras.  And in general, the quality of frames is not inferior to the camera, in this regard, you can always rely on the OnePlus 3 and take it easy on a trip or for a walk as a camera. <br><br>  By the way, the application has a manual mode with the ability to save photos in RAW format, which brings OnePlus 3 closer to professional cameras. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6de/65c/cb0/6de65ccb01efa51c06cc708750245aec.png" width="400"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3ba/124/fcd/3ba124fcdebbfcf6386d97128c226d7f.png" width="400"><br><br>  Sample photos (all clickable): <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/578/b86/186/578b86186c6d4b67934604887d844582.jpg"></a> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/36e/81c/9f9/36e81c9f98464e69a6f3992ff8ee9187.jpg"></a> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a5c/0dc/742/a5c0dc7421034ce0a23541dd9fa81b0d.jpg"></a> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0ba/05f/c8a/0ba05fc8a91640da8d9821fdf4b23dd5.jpg"></a> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a60/4b4/e07/a604b4e075ce4743954ed6433a6f54c6.jpg"></a> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/893/bcb/fe7/893bcbfe7f6c49168cd59f1f3f099c97.jpg"></a> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e0e/81f/2de/e0e81f2de19045d3a47d6d4d081774af.jpg"></a> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/124/deb/eac/124debeac76b42a2b3502592541dc36c.jpg"></a> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/58a/f6e/074/58af6e07421649789cd64d0f2038c90a.jpg"></a> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b1e/16d/09e/b1e16d09ea124846b7a8eeb62d408468.jpg"></a> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/539/7ba/ebe/5397baebe9f04512813eb49b349dd1bc.jpg"></a> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cdc/657/284/cdc65728481e47a6bd594eadaffc813b.jpg"></a> <br><br>  The resolution of the self-camera was 8 megapixel, with its help, too, clear and detailed photos are obtained. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4e0/bce/c4b/4e0bcec4bae44eb4af62c37a0045463f.jpg"></a> <br><br>  OnePlus 3 can write video as 4K, an example of such a video: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GImAbgbR7Yo" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h2>  Communication and navigation </h2><br>  OnePlus 3 works in LTE networks and is equipped with Bluetooth 4.2 and NFC modules.  Wi-Fi is supported at the 802.11ac and IEEE 802.11ad standards.  The smartphone also got a slot for two SIM cards, both nano formats.  It is worth noting the excellent work of GPS - when the test was launched, the module instantly found the satellites and connected to them. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0a1/d01/5c9/0a1d015c9c7abf63556c2325952a6453.png" width="400"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c4e/c35/fd0/c4ec35fd0d414204976bcb271d956424.png" width="400"><br><br><h2>  Autonomy </h2><br>  Battery OnePlus 3 such excitement, like the rest of the specifications, did not cause.  As practice has shown, with a capacity of 3000 mAh, it is able to provide a little more than five hours of active work, which included games, Internet surfing, calls, correspondence in social networks and using the camera. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/359/1af/357/3591af3577d3774ad1fd46154f829e11.png" width="400"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b46/0e5/f97/b460e5f97b4a8f496817e96b7f3e4ddd.png" width="400"><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Using the battery in active mode - it was about five hours (from 16 to 21 hours).</font></i> <br><br>  The result also confirms the PC Mark autonomy test: the OnePlus 3 lasted 5 hours 12 minutes. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/776/2c7/da5/7762c7da5059e97bc6f7cb88f62dca52.png" width="500"></div><br>  Finally, with continuous video playback in air mode and with maximum screen brightness, the OnePlus 3 was discharged in seven and a half hours.  Bottom line: with moderate use, the smartphone will work until the evening, but it‚Äôs worth more to expect. <br><br>  But the battery OnePlus 3 has an undeniable advantage - fast charging.  When using a ‚Äúnative‚Äù cable and adapter, up to 100% of the battery charges in about an hour. <br><br><h2>  Results </h2><br>  The most modern processor, 6 GB of RAM, smart camera - usually a similar pleasure costs at least 50 000 rub.  But OnePlus 3 is not the same - on Gearbest it can be <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/cell-phones/pp_363558.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">ordered for $ 400 +</a> (which is slightly less than 30 000‚ÇΩ).  If you close your eyes to the heating of the case and not the greatest autonomy (than, by the way, the flagships are constantly sinning for&gt; 50,000), then the OnePlus 3 is almost perfect: it looks great and boasts the most advanced iron.  Definitely, this is one of the most interesting smartphones of the year. <br><br>  <b>Liked:</b> <br><br><ul><li>  system speed </li><li>  great camera </li><li>  bright and clear screen </li><li>  fast fingerprint scanner </li><li>  fast charge </li></ul><br>  <b>Did not like:</b> <br><br><ul><li>  case heating </li><li>  average autonomy </li><li>  no memory card support </li></ul><br>  Thanks for attention! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/372559/">https://habr.com/ru/post/372559/</a></p>
