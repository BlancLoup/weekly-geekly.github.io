Unfortunately, there are screenshots of elements and components of the interface, and not a live guide, but there are interesting sections about marketing. </li><li>  Josh Clark talks about working on <a href="https://bigmedium.com/projects/unity-design-system-exxonmobil.html">the ExxonMobil design system</a> . </li></ul><br>  <strong><a href="http://airbnb.io/react-sketchapp/">React Sketch.app</a></strong> <br>  Airbnb brought to mind and published their experimental solution for the export of components from the design system on React to Sketch.

Yes, and Protein promised something similar.  But now there is a more or less universal solution on this topic that you can try yourself (in many ways, this was helped by the new file format in Sketch 43). <br><br>  <strong><a href="https://medium.com/eightshapes-llc/designing-a-systems-team-d22f27a2d81d">Designing a Systems Team</a></strong> <br>  Nathan Curtis describes the organizational models of teams working on a design system.

Dan Mall describes its approach to choosing a pilot project for the implementation of a design system - this is a matrix in which potential candidates are ranked by several parameters. <br><br>  <strong><a href="https://bigmedium.com/ideas/boring-design-systems.html">The Most Exciting Design Systems Are Boring</a></strong> <strong><a href="https://bigmedium.com/ideas/boring-design-systems.html"><br></a></strong>  Josh Clark says that the most powerful design systems focus on solving the most dull tasks - they help automate and unify frequency simplest things like buttons.  Therefore, the correct approach is to go from making the common components and parameters of those things that are already used in real products.  Continuing the theme: <br><br><ul><li>  Emmet Connolly from Intercom writes about his vision for <a href="https://blog.intercom.com/the-full-stack-design-system/">design systems that cover all aspects of the product</a> , not just a set of interface design elements.  <a href="https://bigmedium.com/ideas/links/the-full-stack-design-system.html">Josh Clark argues with him</a> - he says that atomic design does not contradict this approach. </li></ul><br>  <strong><a href="https://medium.com/dropbox-design/illustrating-a-more-human-brand-part-1-e1cfe3c28d9">Illustrating a more human brand, part 1</a></strong> <strong><a href="https://medium.com/dropbox-design/illustrating-a-more-human-brand-part-1-e1cfe3c28d9"><br></a></strong>  Golden article by Michael Jeter, in which he describes in detail the history of the development of the style of illustrations in Dropbox.  He tells how and what tasks each of the approaches solved at specific stages of the company's life cycle.  Continuing the theme: <br><br><ul><li>  Ryan Weaver from Creative Market talks about how the team <a href="https://medium.com/%40ryantheweave/crafting-a-new-illustration-style-for-creative-market-412acba2e673">found and created a new uniform style for interface illustrations</a> . </li></ul><br>  <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/building-blocks/"><strong>Foundation 6 Building Blocks</strong></a> <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/building-blocks/"><br></a>  Zurb added a huge component library to Foundation ‚Äî typical forms, complex menus, article views, and so on.  <a href="http://zurb.com/article/1469/foundation-building-blocks-over-100-compo">Announcement</a> . <br>  <strong><a href="http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/managing-technology-agnostic-design-systems/">Managing Technology-Agnostic Design Systems</a></strong> <br>  Brad Frost writes that a modern design system should not be limited to a specific implementation technology.  In large companies, as a rule, their historical heritage and different products are created in different programming languages ‚Äã‚Äãor frameworks - this harsh reality cannot be changed, you can only adapt to it. <br>  <a href="https://builttoadapt.io/8-point-grid-borders-and-layouts-e91eb97f5091"><strong>8-Point Grid - Borders and Layouts</strong></a> <a href="https://builttoadapt.io/8-point-grid-borders-and-layouts-e91eb97f5091"><br></a>  Elliot Dahl examines one of the main questions that arise when using a step to measure the size of elements and the indents between them - how to count borders and delimiters?  True, it does not concern the most difficult - grids. <br><br>  <strong><a href="https://www.designernews.co/stories/81778-android-adaptive-icon-templates-for-photoshop-sketch-illustrator-affinity-designer">Android adaptive icon templates for Photoshop, Sketch, Illustrator, Affinity Designer</a></strong> <strong><a href="https://www.designernews.co/stories/81778-android-adaptive-icon-templates-for-photoshop-sketch-illustrator-affinity-designer"><br></a></strong>  Bjango have laid out templates for Android O application icons.

They can not always shift them to their product.  It is better to translate the pain of users into the language of business, rather than continue to argue - then everyone will be happy. <br><br> <a href="http://www.jvetrau.com/uxstrategy-5/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4ef/40c/c77/4ef40cc779698b4c51c2afefbac52b6d.png" alt="UX strategy. Part 5 - Exhaust Design" width="450" height="150"></a> <br><br>  We often complain that we are not attracted to work on the definition of a product.  Requirements come from managers and we just draw pictures.  Somewhere this is due to the immaturity of the company and management, somewhere - the weakness and short-sightedness of the designers themselves. <br><br>  If, throughout the entire product creation chain, designers always remember why a company solves specific problems and how these decisions affect the business, the focus shifts from project artifacts and methods to product work.  And finally, we will not only solve development problems, but will influence key business indicators and, perhaps, even introduce innovative ideas.  This transformation of the role of designers consists of three stages: <br><br><ol><li>  Assistance in finding and solving business and user problems. </li><li>  Evaluation of maximum exhaust when solving problems. </li><li>  The transition from problem solving to innovation. </li></ol><br>  <strong><a href="https://www.slideshare.net/jvetrau/ux-75088891">UX-strategy in practice, part 6: Implementation</a></strong> <strong><a href="https://www.slideshare.net/jvetrau/ux-75088891"><br></a></strong>  The final part of the series describes a step-by-step plan for the implementation of the UX-strategy.  It is not enough to accomplish the feat in the form of a successful redesign of an outdated service - you need to ensure the repeatability of good results.  Therefore, you need to think about the restructuring of the socio-technical system, rather than just updating multiple screens.  The cause of bad products is a bad machine that produces them, so you need to fix it first. <br><br>  The sixth part is based on the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãdesign management patterns and actively refers to the previous ones.  For those who have not read them, it will be more difficult to understand, but this is, in fact, a draft for a future mini-site built around these patterns.  To some, it will seem a rebuilt version of the first part, and this is partly true.
