  <section class="page js-page"><h1>A couple of interesting books for revolutionary startups</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello, dear habouksoobschestvo!  Today I want to submit my review (although, rather, my vision) to two interesting books by Guy Kawasaki, published in Russian.  We are talking about ‚ÄúStartup‚Äù and ‚ÄúRevolutionary product.  How to create and bring to the market ‚Äù. <br>  Perhaps this will really help someone, but maybe not.  In any case, I just want to warn you that there are no need for personal IT-users for Kawasaki under kat.  Seriously, you just won't find any useful information there. <br>  All the rest I ask for me! <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/97f/9ad/d3a/97f9add3a28910180c82cceaecc391f5.gif" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  At the beginning, I wanted to write a review for only 1 book, but I came to the conclusion that any of them would be incomplete without a second.  These books are like a complete system and, therefore, must be read in the system.  So, I will present them to you in the order in which, in my opinion, they should be taken. <br><br><h4>  A revolutionary product.  How to create and bring to market. </h4><br>  I will begin with this book, since at first glance it represents something more world-view than practical, a sort of ‚Äúbible for a revolutionary start-uper‚Äù.  At second glance, it is such, especially if you misunderstand what a startup is (hello to grantoe!) 
      <br>

      Indeed, the book helps to take a clearer look at today's world-class business opportunities, on business without borders, and work as a lifestyle.  As well as many barriers on the way to this world, with pink unicorns and ponies beating around with a rainbow.  The book is divided into 3 logical chapters (not counting the conclusion) with several logical sub-items in each of them. <br><br><h5>  First chapter ‚ÄúCreate as God‚Äù </h5><br>  Well draws attention to such obvious things as the importance of alternative thinking, breadth of views and the need to constantly strive to go a little beyond the existing structure of things.  Nevertheless, the evidence of these moments does not mean their simplicity, otherwise how else to explain that the majority of ‚Äútwo guys from the garage‚Äù (two girls, a boy and a girl, aha) do not follow them. <br><br>  <u>Exercise.</u> <br>  Would there be cars now if entrepreneurs always focused only on the desires of their consumers?  Or would we never get off the horses, driven to an incredible state? <br><br><h5>  Chapter Two ‚ÄúManage Like a King‚Äù </h5><br>  The main idea here, I think, is an alternative (relative to the current state of affairs) view of interaction with people both inside and outside the company.  Not surprisingly, Guy focuses on evangelicals - users of a product or service who are ready to promote it (as well as your brand, related products and lifestyle in general) simply because they liked the product very much and / or interaction with the creator company. .  Much attention is paid to how to acquire, retain and grow them.  Pretty helpful and even fun tips. <br><br><h5>  Third chapter ‚ÄúWork like a slave‚Äù </h5><br>  In this part, Guy hopes that revolutionary readers will learn another very simple, but also very useful idea: you need to work effectively.  No seriously.  Not much, not tough and not to wear, but it is effective.  Just as it is impossible to create a revolution by lying in a lethargic dream on a couch in front of the TV, so by imitating vigorous activity for 9 hours in an office full of sworn friends, or falling at work without any satisfaction or special money. <br><br>  Whether you like it or not (although if you don‚Äôt like it, then why do you need these books at all?), But you will have to go out of your usual way of the world and reconsider a number of views on the information being absorbed and given, lifestyle other  And yes, most likely it will be long, difficult, not necessarily lead to the desired result, but very interesting. <br><br>  <u>Exercise.</u> <br>  Does everything suit you in your life, arms and work?  If yes, then congratulations - about 99% of the population of our globe is jealous of you and this is really very cool. <br><br><h4>  A little bit about ‚ÄúStartup‚Äù. </h4><br>  The second book is simply called ‚ÄúStartup‚Äù.  If you get to it, then here you will have a more practical approach to business.  This is not even a book, but rather a collection of life experiences and interesting practices. <br><br>  This collection presents 11 workshops.  Each of them (well, almost everyone, except the 11th) illuminates the formation of a company in accordance with curve J. This curve is sometimes called the ‚Äúhockey stick curve‚Äù and it symbolizes the company's development stages corresponding to ‚Äúsowing‚Äù, ‚Äústart-up‚Äù, ‚ÄúGrowth‚Äù and ‚Äúexpansion‚Äù. <br><br>  I decided not to describe each master class here individually, but simply to list the main ideas that seemed most interesting to me.  Of course, you can expand, complete, or even completely rethink this entire list, if only you set yourself such a goal. <br><br><h5>  Here is my list: </h5><br><br><ul><li>  Compose a cool name and short mantra for the product (1 - 3 words) </li><li>  Always submit demo samples at presentations. </li><li>  Lay the business model in 10 words </li><li>  Strive to create a product 10 times better than an existing one </li><li>  Talk about your product to everyone.  Generally all. </li><li>  Create a promo website with a normal address and always keep business cards with you </li><li>  Try to get maximum customer loyalty, not maximum market coverage </li><li>  Clearly identify and adhere to product positioning </li><li>  Presentation of the goods on 10 slides </li><li>  Immediately at the beginning of the presentation to describe what the company does.  It is better to grovel about your life history later, much later. </li><li>  Record client responses during a presentation. </li><li>  Play on the opposition with the already existing untwisted brands. </li><li>  Refinement, delivery, refinement, delivery ... And not refinement, refinement, refinement, delivery. </li></ul><br><br><h4>  So will making me reading these books a revolutionary? </h4><br><br>  Not.  If the answer for you is not self-evident, then you should definitely read these books.  Before the onset of enlightenment.  Probably. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/197982/">https://habr.com/ru/post/197982/</a></p>
