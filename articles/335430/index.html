In this article I will talk about it-school from Samsung in Russia on behalf of a graduate. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  What is written on the school website: <br><br><blockquote>  IT-school SAMSUNG is an additional education program on the basics of IT and programming.  It is open to high school students in more than 20 cities of Russia.

      Through training at the IT-school SAMSUNG, students gain knowledge of the basics of IT, as well as the skills to develop mobile applications in Java using Android. <br><br>  The training course of the program was created by Samsung Research Center specialists with the support of leading teachers of the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology (MIPT). <br><br>  Classes are held in classrooms equipped with modern Samsung technology (tablets, laptops, electronic boards) under the guidance of professional teachers.  Education is free.  Course duration - 1 year. </blockquote><br><hr><br>  I studied at this school this year.  And there are a few thoughts on this. <br><br>  Programming and the IT industry as a whole are developing very actively and constantly need new employees in various fields.  It is a pity that there are very few such courses for the younger generation, and courses that give a solid foundation for future development are in general disastrous. <br><br>  IT SCHOOL SAMSUNG - gallop across Europe.  For 1 year of study, too many topics are covered (from the syntax of the Java language to Retrofit, SQLite, Cloud platforms), which is why the attendance of classes is not enough.  For each topic allocated to the training manual with the theory, d / z. <br><br>  However, to fully understand the topic, you need to google the material yourself and practice.  I'm not saying that this is bad, quite the opposite.  To cultivate the ability to self-learning - cool. <br><br>  This school provides everything you need to study - laptops, tablets, cables.  Convenient if you do not have their own devices. <br><br>  I do not know how in other cities, but I liked the teaching staff.  24/7 available for questions. <br><br>  Classes are held in groups of up to 30 people, there is a break for tea.  Good decision, because  for the lesson you need to learn a large amount of information and without a 15-minute rest the brain boils. <br><br>  At the end of the year, each student must submit an individual project in order to receive a certificate. <br><br>  What does it mean: a student independently, or with someone in a pair, must develop applications for Android OS and demonstrate its performance.  Quite interesting, and the motivation is for the whole year. <br><br>  In addition, among the projects of students held a competition, which takes place in several stages.  The competition is quite serious, so you have to work a lot.  Winners receive nice prizes. <br><br>  The course is divided into several modules.  At the end of each of them, students write a test.  Based on the test results, a certificate is issued at the end of the year. <br><br>  The certificate is of two types: purple and gold.  It is clear that the gold is steeper.  It is issued if the student successfully defended his project and passed all tests above the n mark. <br><br>  The certificate gives <a href="http://myitschool.ru/cert.php">bonuses</a> for admission to some universities in Russia (as the organizers say, the list is constantly updated). <br><br>  What is the result?  A small amount of knowledge about Java Java, Android OS and understanding of OOP.  And also a bunch of ready-made applications) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/335430/">https://habr.com/ru/post/335430/</a></p>
