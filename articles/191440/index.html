  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Delegation</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello dear community.  In the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/190166/">last post</a> I talked about the problem and the solution of technical debts in the web studio.  Now, I propose to consider another, no less interesting phenomenon in this wonderful business.  Namely, the issue of studio growth and delegation.  Before the beginning of the story, I would like to remind you that this material is unlikely to be of interest to those who are full-time business sharks and tattered converters, it is aimed at those who have recently been in this sphere, or among those who have buried themselves in a glass ceiling. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So, we will consider everything as the simplest task (the conditions of the problem are shamelessly stealing from my post). <br>  In stock: <br>  1. A ready-made business that is not shaky is not shaky, but it works.  (The concept of working means functioning, and we, so far, do not ask ourselves a question of efficiency, about it below). <br>  2. There is a team of specialists, let's say, far from "dreamy", but not the worst offer on the market, the tasks are being carried out, and this is the main criterion. <br>  3. That is not unimportant, we have customers, and suppose that they are more than enough. <br><br>  Now the main front of the problem is the <b>operational blockage of the manager</b> , who is often a sales manager, a marketer, and a project manager, and perhaps also codit or dizignit from time to time and tries to study accounting.  What a mnogoyruky multilegal. <br>  To begin with, let's define - what is the operational blockage and where do ‚Äúlegs grow from?‚Äù <br>  Operating systems are those matters that require your intervention, as a rule, in the ‚ÄúHIGH-SPEED DUST‚Äù and ‚ÄúURGENT !!! 11‚Äù mode.  It is a routine of a type of tax calculation, quarter closure, payroll, invoicing, project management and thinking about a bright tomorrow. <br><br><h5>  Slight shock therapy. </h5><br>  Bright tomorrow in this situation will not be.  And no, you will not be the first to do this.  The only thing you need to do now is to stop for a couple of hours.  And yes, have to do. <br>  The big problem, in my opinion, is that a huge, overwhelming number of people who open their business are not directly involved in those things that specifically and accurately bring them profit.  They are ready to do anything but that. <br>  If you learned in the description of yourself - you need to learn how to delegate your responsibilities.  Start with an accounting and management type of routine.  Hire professionals.  You are already at that very point of no return, when it is necessary to gradually hire professionals.  Think about this kind of thing - a good specialist is well worth it, this is logical, the market is the market.  Do not rate this as a cost.  This is an investment.  Invest in your business.  Do not make a fatal mistake - do not hire non-professionals burning with ambitious eyes.  All that interests you now is the effectiveness of a single unit in the form of an employee and the company as a whole.  Hiring non-professional = not effective work.  Not effective work - the money in the pipe, and the loss is a multiple of more than the payment of a good specialist.

    <h5>  Shock therapy number two. </h5><br>  ‚ÄúFear‚Äù of many managers ‚Äúif I hire a specialist, he will lead my clients, the team / programmer / designer‚Äù ... Yes, this can be.  And <u>that's fine</u> .  Understand the market is huge and in it a whole bunch of cool specialists from various fields and customers even more.  Suppose you have already taken a couple of steps, hired sales, maybe even two, and even an accountant - you continue to lead the projects yourself.  This is another huge mistake novice leader.  Let the project is engaged in PM.  Supervise the manager, not his project.  This will remove another huge headache from you.  A little later, I would recommend taking one more PM (two of them are usually enough for a very, very long time, with the condition that they are cool). <br>  Here, the head already hurts less, and now, your task is to find a good, experienced, specialist called the head of the sales department.  No one argues and says that you are doing it badly, the fact is that it needs to be delegated.  This is precisely the thin line between you - a specialist in sales and they are a professional in them.  The amount of his knowledge, successful practices and methods is incomparably higher than yours.  Use. <br><br>  In total, three salespeople are already small, but an army capable of bringing in customers and quite profitable projects. <br>  Two PM - leading projects, supervising tasks, helping the team. <br>  Accountant - leading the lion's share of questions from which you can go crazy. <br>  Total, plus six people.  They do not need to be hired right here right now, they need to be hired for 4-6-8 months, depending on your workload and capabilities.  And so, at the very moment when you have earned a new mechanism - you can finally do what the head should do - think about where to go next.  Strategy, analysis, tactics.  Here are your three main battlefields for a relatively long time. <br>  This recipe is not a panacea and is suitable only for those web-studios whose managers are in a state that borders on madness. <br>  Thank you for reading, and good luck.  Delegate.  Especially routine. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/191440/">https://habr.com/ru/post/191440/</a></p>
