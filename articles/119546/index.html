  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Heroic timing</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Our whole life consists of various tasks and deadlines for their implementation.  Ideally, the presence of a fixed term directly affects whether the task is completed or not, although, of course, one also has to deal with deviations from the norm, which are expressed in the failure of these very terms.  In this situation, a rather interesting phenomenon arises: the deadline set for us by <b>someone</b> , as a rule, has a much <b>stronger impact</b> on the accomplishment of the task than the deadline that we set for ourselves.  Although it would seem that we know ourselves better than others, we get along well with ourselves, we are interested in personal success more than in anything else, but at the same time, we, over and over again, carefreely manage to disrupt the deadlines set.  The consequence of this was the emergence of "heroic deadlines," as I call them. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b><i>‚ÄúHeroic Term‚Äù is a term established by us for ourselves, for which we must have time to accomplish a much greater amount of work in a short period of time.</i></b> <br><br>  ‚ÄúI‚Äôll read the whole book in a night!‚Äù, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll manage to put together all the internal pages in 2 hours!‚Äù, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll finish my coursework today!‚Äù - I think everyone‚Äôs phrases are painfully familiar.  Usually, such heroic exclamations arise when:

        <ins class="adsbygoogle"

          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"

      <br>
      a) inspired us; <br>  b) we are on the verge of meeting deadlines (and no matter who they are determined by). <br><br>  In most cases, this idea is a failure, though not fatal.  As a result, we finish the work for a much longer time, after which we proceed to the next task and again do not cope with the deadline set for it.  That is why I strongly recommend not to set "heroic deadlines."  I will explain why. <br><br>  At the first stage, when the task is received and the time is set, we are not particularly concerned about its implementation, because in reserve we have a lot of time ahead.  At the second stage, activities are being carried out aimed at accomplishing this task, albeit with varying success, because the necessary pace was not there from the very beginning.  At the third stage, when there is very little time left, we easily set a "heroic time" for ourselves.  As a result, we have: <br><br>  a) a task not completed on time; <br>  b) twice the deadlines (normal and ‚Äúheroic‚Äù); <br>  c) loss of strength, energy and belief in oneself (more often on a subconscious level); <br><br>  This last point is the reason that we cannot set the necessary pace of work on a new task from the very beginning, because we need time to recover.  Thus, the presence of ‚Äúheroic deadlines‚Äù puts us in a vicious circle of inefficient solution of the tasks before us. <br><br>  Get rid of the habit of setting "heroic deadlines."  Be honest with yourself and do not try to jump above your head.  It is better to fully realize your strength, evenly distribute tasks and, avoiding stresses, solve them.  Over time, you will gain a comfortable pace of work for you and become excellent, and most importantly on time, to cope with the tasks you are facing. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/119546/">https://habr.com/ru/post/119546/</a></p>
