  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Multifunctional Robot for washing windows of skyscrapers</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello, dear friends! <br><br>  I bring to your attention the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating a multifunctional robot for washing windows of skyscrapers.  Imagine a scorpion robot, which will move on the paws, suckers on the glasses, and the tail will function as a hand, at the end of which the glass cleaning system will be fixed.  To get started (to start the robot) you need to wash one stained glass on the first floor of a skyscraper.  Then, the robot is installed on this clean surface and begins its movement upwards. <a name="habracut"></a><br>  The tail of a scorpion robot hangs over its front part (head) and the working surface of the tail clears its way upwards (the working surface is located where the venomous sting of a live scorpion is located).  Having washed out the window of the second floor, the robot moves to a clean, dry surface prepared by it, which ensures reliable adhesion of the suction cups to the glass.  Thus, the robot always keeps on the glass, which is deliberately free from dirt.  This is with regard to the introduction and brief description of the workflow.  Next, I will introduce you to the relevance of the topic and the detailed principle of the robot. <br><br><h4>  Relevance of the topic </h4><br>  Owners of modern skyscrapers spend huge amounts of money to keep buildings clean.  And if indoor robots are already quite widely used for cleaning and cleaning floors, (I mean large washing machines with a driver that wash and polish tile and other coatings), then outside robots are not used yet.  Although the cost of washers, which hang from the roof on the lines or platform, is quite impressive.  So why not to entrust this dangerous work not to the person, but to the robot?  Such a robot will be able to wash a building throughout its entire service life and always maintain it in perfect shape, because the costs are many times different from the ways people currently use.  In addition, the robot can wash not one building, but 2, 3 or even 10, serving these skyscrapers in turn.  The robot is universal and is absolutely suitable for any buildings.  To service the robot is enough one trained person.

      After analyzing a lot of material, communicating with interested people of different professions and impartially and soberly weighing all the pros and cons, I came to the conclusion that an automated system for washing windows for skyscrapers is the most relevant topic of the future.  Large business centers, modern cities and cities, they all suffer from dirt, smog and soot.  From this it follows that the market for the use of this robot is wide and has no boundaries, including state ones.  In each country there are several cities where this technique will find its application. <br><br><h4>  Project strengths </h4><br>  At the moment, there are already window cleaning robots on the market.  There are both industrial and for home use, but all these not numerous models are rather raw, primitive and little effective.  The idea that I propose is a fundamentally different approach.  It consists in absolute autonomy of work, reliability, impeccable quality of window cleaning and a number of other advantages. <br><br>  So, specifically about the robot. <br><br>  1) The method of mounting the robot to a skyscraper. <br>  As I said, the robot looks like a scorpion.  To climb steep walls, there is no better adapted insect than the spider.  Six limbs make it easy to move on any surface, including vertical.  Accordingly, to move the robot on the glass surface, we take the structure of the arachnid insect as a base, add a working hand to it, with which the robot will clean the glass and get something closely resembling a scorpion.  Regarding specifically suckers, thanks to which the robot can be reliably fixed on any floor of a skyscraper.  Many have seen suckers that are used in their work by installers of plastic windows, and if someone was interested in them, he knows that this device is most reliably fixed on the glass.  I propose to use similar Velcro on each of the six limbs of the robot.  At the end of each leg of the scorpion robot will be placed one mechanized sucker.  It is mechanized due to the fact that several sensors work on the suction cup when in contact with a smooth surface.  Information from the sensors goes to the central computer.  Based on the information from these sensors, the computer makes a decision: the sucker correctly lies on the surface of the glass, you can turn on the sticking mode on this tab.  At the same second, suction to the glass occurs and this foot is securely fixed to the surface.  This all happens in a matter of seconds.  Thus, alternately sucked legs will allow the robot to move in any direction.  The detachment of the suction cups occurs according to a similar principle: as soon as the robot needs to tear the paw off the surface, a signal arrives and the suction cup becomes detached.  In addition to this, there is a security system that, using negative pressure sensors, collects information about the reliability of fastening of each tab.  Due to the fact that the robot always moves only on the cleaned surface, the risk of weak adhesion is minimized.  The algorithm of moving and sticking, I think it became clear to everyone.  Go ahead‚Ä¶ <br><br>  2) Working hand or tail of a scorpion. <br>  The tail of a scorpion robot will not consist of a large number of elements, like a real insect, - this design, in my opinion, is too troublesome and unreliable.  I propose to use only 3 articulated mechanisms: at the base of the tail, a little further and at the very tip of the tail, I am convinced that this will be enough.  The tail is driven by electricity.  The tail at the end has a telescopic principle and pushes forward some distance.  This is necessary so that the robot, being on one window, could easily reach the window above the floor and launder the area needed for it and follow it above. <br><br>  3) Washing pad. <br>  On the tail of the scorpion is a window cleaning system.  I will not go into the details of her work, I will only say that using high-performance foam, she can easily wash the windows and leave them dry.  This washing pad is a consumable item and can be easily changed as needed.  Dirty water from the glass, this nozzle is collected in a container.  Leakage of dirty smudges on the frames and other windows is excluded. <br>  Positioning the robot on a skyscraper. <br>  Before starting operation on a specific object, data about the external dimensions of the building, the size of windows, projections, the number of floors, in general, all external parameters of the building are entered into a computer.  Thus, the robot always understands which floor and window it is located on, which windows have been washed and how much is left. <br><br><h4>  Design and power </h4><br>  The robot is made of carbon fiber and works by electricity.  The robot receives the required amount of energy by hanging from the upper floor cable.  So that the wire does not sag, there is a cable feeding system.  Based on the location of the robot, the system monitors cable slack. <br><br><h4>  Payload </h4><br>  On the abdomen of the robot are two tanks.  In one there is foam (10 l), and in the other comes dirty waste liquid (10 l).  Containers change on the ground. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/198456/">https://habr.com/ru/post/198456/</a></p>
