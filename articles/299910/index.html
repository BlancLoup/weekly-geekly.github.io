Business objects: new technologies - Advantages.</a>  <a href="https://megamozg.ru/post/25594/">Perspectives.</a> </li></ul><br><br><h1>  THE INTERNET OF THINGS: NEW OPPORTUNITIES </h1><br><h2>  1. Network </h2><br>  The Internet of Things (Internet of Things, IoT) is rather a special look at a coherent network of automated and user devices in terms of new commercial and technological capabilities.  In order to consider the very concept of the Internet of things, one has to recognize a single technological platform for communication of a certain type of devices.  Therefore, the developers of solutions within IoT pay special attention to the principles, standards and regulations of network communications. <br><br>  In its essence, the Internet of things is a kind of network of interacting objects.  Obviously, to consider a set of objects that do not interact within the network, even if they have access to it, does not make much sense.  Therefore, it is the process of communication between objects that is important.  But such a process is possible only in conditions where things ‚Äúunderstand‚Äù each other, and this means that things must be located in a <i>single technological network</i> . <br><br>  It remains an open question about the essence of those objects that interact.  Whether only physical objects should be included in the IoT, or is it necessary to additionally consider logical objects acting as independent units.  Perhaps at the initial stage of research on IoT, it made sense to be limited to purely physical objects.  But now, when devices have become so diverse, and Internet communications have become so complicated, it is reasonable to consider a thing on the global network as a separate logical entity involved in differentiated transactions.  Here are a few factors that indicate that it is incorrect to limit IoT to only physical things: <br><ul><li>  the network object participates in communications as some separate information-logical unit that is capable of receiving and transmitting information; </li><li>  one physical object can be identified (presented to other objects) by several different logical devices; </li><li>  network object can interact simultaneously and independently with other objects; </li><li>  an object can implement various levels of access to its own attributes and functionality, dividing access according to security levels; </li><li>  A physical object can be identified on the network as part of another physical or logical object, or it can be identified through another proxy object. </li></ul><br>  The viewpoint on IoT as a network of physical objects should convincingly show that today not only physical users and automated systems are involved in the Internet, not only functional algorithms and hypertext content, but also numerous autonomous or dependent physical devices and logical entities that carry the action. from the information field to the real material space.  This is important for building many new processes and for increasing the efficiency of existing procedures. <br><br>  In other words, if earlier we understood the <i>Internet</i> as a global information network, then with the advent of the <i>Internet of Things, the</i> emphasis shifted to involving material objects into the global network and extracting the beneficial effect of sharing incredibly large amounts of information and various devices united by virtual and real interaction. <br><br><h2>  2. Factors </h2><br>  The main factors that contributed to the emergence of the concept of the Internet of things and its development in theoretical and practical terms: <br><ul><li>  <b>increase in Internet bandwidth</b> (allows you to share an unlimited amount of data required in different formats); </li><li>  <b>Internet access via differentiated communication channels and in various modes</b> (provides access for users and devices to the network from a variety of places with a given quality of service); </li><li>  <b>the increase in the number of devices with access to the Internet</b> (forms an actively interacting environment of users and devices and contributes to the emergence of relevant needs); </li><li>  <b>a variety of devices with access to the Internet</b> (determines the development of technologies and communication protocols of users and devices, as well as the implementation of a wide range of tasks using the network); </li><li>  <b>the formation of the needs related to the interaction of devices in the global information network</b> (promotes interest in the problems of intensive communication of users and devices on the Internet of many commercial and public structures); </li><li>  <b>expansion of business projects and connections within the Internet</b> (forms the infrastructure, economic and financial models that support the development of the network); </li><li>  <b>a variety of innovative ideas, projects and businesses</b> in the framework of network communication between users and devices (actively develops in theory and in practice the forms and formats of network communications); </li><li>  <b>understanding the obvious benefits of networking</b> (attracts resources, information, entrepreneurs, and investments); </li><li>  <b>development of the Internet of Things infrastructure</b> , including: network data storage, identification and security certificates, secure data chains, standards and interaction guidelines (makes the development of the network stable and irreversible). </li></ul><br><br>  <i><a href="https://megamozg.ru/post/25490/">(continued - Part 2.
