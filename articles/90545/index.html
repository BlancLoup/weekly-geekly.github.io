    <h4>  The first day </h4><br><br>  Arriving at 8:10, and immediately standing in the queue for registration, we get a badge. <br>  Here is such a. <br> <a href=""><img src="http://img245.imageshack.us/img245/5738/img7021c.jpg" alt="Badge"></a> <br><br>  At the entrance of the great <s>severe guys</s> guards let them. <br><br>  After logging in immediately comes stand Intel (Opposite - Oracle) <br> <a href=""><img src="http://img696.imageshack.us/img696/6558/img6712y.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  It makes no sense to upload photos of all stands, because  for them you will understand little. <br>  Immediately after Intel comes the Elcom stand, then the Deutche bank, then the User groups stand, and then comes the entrance to the small hall, then Java ME, JavaFX, Java SE, NetBeans, Sun Datacenter Solutions, and then (They distributed free T-shirts and magazines) Street <br><br>  If you start with Oracle (I repeat: opposite Intel), then comes Oracke Technology Network, JetBrains, MySQL, HeadHunter, TuneIT, Oracle Solaris, InstallFest, VirtualBox, Linux Format (Where you could subscribe to the magazine), Books.ru, Open systems ... <br><br><h5>  More about stands </h5><br><br>  At the booth, Intel told and distributed disks with Evaluation Software, Parallels Studio ... <br>  At the Elcom booth, people who wanted to purchase Sun products could get information about servers, pricing, configuration, etc. <br>  At the User groups stand you were invited to the JUG (Java users group), told about their conferences ... <br>  On the stands of Java ME, JavaFX, Java SE, NetBeans, you could learn what it is, take the discs with this software <br>  On the stand of the Sun Datacenter Solution was a presentation of Storage, and regular Sun servers. <br><br>  And behind all this there were coffee breaks, where you could have a <s>nourishing, calm and</s> normal meal. <br>  On the first day there was a crazed madness with food, due to the huge number of people who arrived. <br><br>  In the same place where the coffee breaks, there was a scene where the balalaika players were playing something. <br> <a href=""><img src="http://img687.imageshack.us/img687/3613/img6724o.jpg" alt="Fun, wow!"></a> <br><br><h5>  Little about the reports </h5><br>  I immediately left the plenary report, which James Gosling did not attend, and I don‚Äôt know what was there. <br>  From other reports of the photo it makes no sense to cite these reports will be published soon <br><br><h5>  About fun or a stone in the garden to the organizers </h5><br>  When registering, everyone was given a white bag with a Java logo, which contained a pen, a notebook and a questionnaire. <br>  For the completed questionnaire submitted after 17:45 promised laptop bag (Immediately I say the promise fulfilled). <br>  Throughout the day, in the intervals between the reports - all this time, the public was fueled by reports that there were 1,700 bags, and there were 3,000+ people and that there might not be enough bags. <br>  As a result, the crowd lined up in a huge queue 40 minutes before the issue, there was a crush and some people filled out questionnaires on the backs of others, the upper rooms for reports were empty ... <br><img src="http://img530.imageshack.us/img530/2271/img6868i.jpg" alt="Crush"><br>  Queue less from a different angle <br> <a href=""><img src="http://img402.imageshack.us/img402/8932/img6876w.jpg" alt="Crush2"></a> <br><br>  As it turned out there were enough bags for everyone ... <br><br><h5>  Beer, sausages and rock and roll! </h5><br>  At the end of the day, a buffet table, chips, beer, sausages was organized ... <br>  Of the minuses that the crazy crowd of beer lovers blows all. <br><br><h4>  Second day </h4><br>  When I arrived at 8:55, I was very surprised, there were almost no people (Compared to the first day). <br><br>  Having risen in a cafe on the second floor, I saw how much free space. <br>  It looks fun and sad, remembering how many people there were yesterday. <br><img src="http://img338.imageshack.us/img338/5093/img6975j.jpg" alt="Above"><br><br><h5>  Oracle Lounge </h5><br>  Separately, it is necessary to mention the living room of Oracle, where I did not go to the first day. <br>  On these ottomans great sleep. <br> <a href=""><img src="http://img718.imageshack.us/img718/3884/img7013.jpg" alt="Living room"></a> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="http://img153.imageshack.us/img153/8192/img6985.jpg" alt="Oracle Lounge"></a> <br><br><h5>  Food </h5><br>  Fed excellent, if not crush. <br>  From chocolates, cookies, chips - to sandwiches with cheese, sausage, ham, sausages and salads. <br><img src="http://img245.imageshack.us/img245/38/img6982zr.jpg" alt="yum"><br><br><h5>  Internet cafe </h5><br>  Everywhere at the conference stood Sun Ray'i, on the second floor you could sit on the Internet.  True, at the end of the second day, the server to which these terminals were connected was still laid down. <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/671/d11/ad9/671d11ad91f97cf12c7cc101e2f24ab1.jpg" alt="Sun ray"></a> <br><br><h4>  Overall impression </h4><br>  The overall impression was spoiled by the absence of James Gosling, the crush on the first day and the crush for food. <br>  But in general, good. <br><br>  <a href="http://developers.sun.ru/techdays2010/">Developers.sun.ru</a> - About the conference. <br><br>  <b>PS</b> I apologize for some confusion and poor quality photos, if you forgot something - tell me.  It is impossible to tell what was told to everyone near each stand.  My task was only to give a general idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhat was there. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/90545/">https://habr.com/ru/post/90545/</a></p>
