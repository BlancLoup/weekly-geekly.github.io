  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to constantly improve your skills</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Perhaps you think that you are a genius in your field, and perhaps you are right. <br>  But for sure you can achieve more, nobody is perfect and even you have something to strive for.  For your development as a professional in your field, it is important to know your strengths and constantly develop them, while not forgetting to learn new skills. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So how do you constantly develop your skills?  Here are a few suggestions: <br><br><h3>  Leave time to learn new </h3><br>  Perhaps it will be 30 minutes a day or 1 hour a week, it‚Äôs important that you leave time to regularly learn something new in your profession.  It can be reading magazines, blogs, books, studying other people's works, it is important that at the same time you expand your knowledge and develop skills.  Whatever you do, never shorten the time you spend on advanced training. <br><br><h3>  Think what you are doing </h3><br>  Many of us do our work so long ago that we no longer think about it - this is a bad sign, your work will be of the same level, and your skills will not improve.  Think about what you are doing, constantly try to find a way to make your work better.

    <h3>  Work on yourself </h3><br>  After you start thinking about what you are doing you need to pay attention to how you do it.  Analyze your skills, find out what you have succeeded in and what you need to pull up.  Any workflow, even the most advanced, can be improved. <br><br><h3>  Seek inspiration </h3><br>  If you are doing your job well enough and consistently, it may be difficult to find motivation for further development.  In this case, look at the work of others, especially the best specialists in your field and recognized masters, often this may be enough to understand that you need to develop and get enough motivation.  Try to follow the best work in your field, and you will always be the motivation for further development. <br><br><h3>  Learn from the best </h3><br>  You study the works of masters in detail, read about them and read what they write.  If possible, learn directly from the master.  Cooperate with him, be in his team, work in his company, develop a joint project.  Nothing can teach you better than working with someone who knows what they are doing.  Pay attention to everything he does, ask questions.  Remember, the master has become who he is, learning from previous masters. <br><br><h3>  Look for critics </h3><br>  Sometimes it is difficult to notice your mistakes, because you are deeply immersed in work.  Therefore, a fresh look from the outside is always helpful.  Ask someone you respect to criticize your work, ask him to be honest.  Never be offended or angry at criticism, any criticism is useful, try to use it to improve yourself.  Be sure to write down everything that the critic has noticed, and look for ways to improve each item. <br><br><h3>  Attend seminars or courses </h3><br>  I believe that you can get the same information from books or the Internet, but there is nothing better than learning courses because they give time to sit down and digest the information received, and you can interact with the teacher, which can contribute to a better understanding of the material.  And if you carry out some task, you will receive criticism from an expert! <br><br><h3>  If work becomes boring, then it's time to work on yourself. </h3><br>  If you are bored with work, then most likely the reason is that you have ceased to set new goals for yourself and develop.  You do not need to change your profession, look at what you are doing, set yourself a worthy goal, most likely it will make you think about improving your professional skills. <br><br><h3>  Similar articles </h3><br>  <a href="http://designformasters.info/posts/staying-motivated">How to keep motivation?</a> <br>  <a href="http://designformasters.info/posts/10-productivity-tips">Increase web designer productivity</a> <br>  <a href="http://designformasters.info/posts/setting-up">How to start in Web Design?</a> <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/31304/">https://habr.com/ru/post/31304/</a></p>
