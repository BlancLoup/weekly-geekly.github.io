Two years of study were really difficult, but flew by. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/543/c85/3a8/543c853a8f6752dd2ae8a4ad1057e90c.png"><br>  <i>Arkady Volozh and Elena Bunina</i> <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  It would seem that quite recently I first heard about the "School of Data Analysis."  At the end of the third year I, like any student of the Physics and Technology Institute, had to choose a basic department.  Most departments conducted presentations at our institute, including Yandex‚Äôs ‚ÄúData Analysis‚Äù based on the ShAD.  At the presentation, Elena Bunina, Andrei Mikhailovich Raigorodsky and other teachers told us what they teach in the School, what scientific and career prospects open to students who graduated from this school.  With no doubts about the choice, I decided that I would go to the Yandex department.

      In the summer I filled out a questionnaire on the site, came for an interview.  I remember, I was very surprised by the task to write a program on a piece of paper, before it had to be done only at school.  And when announcing the results, it was a pleasant surprise to see several familiar names in the list of enrolled ones - more fun together. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/41e/ab8/958/41eab895821b33ab63ac56c23c6e6e22.png"><br>  <i>Graduates, students and teachers of the School of Data Analysis</i> <br><br>  In September, classes began.  I really liked the topics of courses at the SAD and interesting homework, and I was always upset if I couldn‚Äôt go to any subject because of the pairs in the institute.  I remember that on Saturday evening there were classes in C ++ with Alexei Zobnin, and at that time I had couples in the military department, which I must attend.  I had to illegally run away "AWOL" in order to catch at least a seminar. <br><br>  Of course, at first it was very difficult to learn, I will never forget the correspondence of ten letters in both directions in order to pass the task of algorithms, and sleepless nights in the struggle for quality percentages in machine learning tasks.  But now such moments are recalled with a smile and a little pity that this is all over. <br><br>  After three months of studying at the SAD, they took me to practice at Yandex, where we wrote a small search engine from scratch.  This is where knowledge of algorithms, pluses and machine learning is needed.  After another three months, I became an intern, then a developer, then a practice supervisor.  During these two years, I managed to work in three departments of Yandex, and everywhere I was helped by the skills that I acquired in the School. <br><br>  At the beginning of this year, I replaced Elena Bunin as the administrator of the ShAD.  Of course, this is a big responsibility: it is necessary to recruit new students for the first year, to organize the educational process, and there are still many, many things.  And I'm sure everything will work out. <br><br>  By the way, the ‚Äú <a href="http://shad.yandex.ru/">School of Data Analysis</a> ‚Äù set continues, and the set is in full swing at the <a href="http://compscicenter.ru/">Computer Science Center</a> in St. Petersburg, where the Data mining department can be considered the St. Petersburg branch of the SAD. <br><br>  <b><i>Artyom Babenko,</i></b> <b><i><br></i></b>  <b><i>Administrator of the School of Data Analysis,</i></b> <b><i><br></i></b>  <b><i>Head of ShAD Practice Group at Yandex</i></b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/122021/">https://habr.com/ru/post/122021/</a></p>
