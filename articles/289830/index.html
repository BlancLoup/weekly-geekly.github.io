  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Creating a company. Sales Part 1</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  What is most important when creating (your) company?  Create an innovative product that can change the world?  Find funds?  To bring people into the team?  Create a prototype? .. Of course, all these items are very important, especially for a new company.  At the same time, the above-mentioned item of the entire list of important things is sales.  Surely, you often met with the dispute, more importantly, production or sales.  You will not find the answer to this question in my articles - you must decide on the importance yourself.  However, finding a client, that is, selling what is not there, is much more pleasant than creating the perfect finished product, but not knowing who will buy it and when, and wait for the first sales. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <i>Important note.</i>  <i>We are not talking about state and other tenders, in which production is paid on a mandatory basis.</i>  <i>We are talking about a classic commercial non-governmental organization that spends money on its development through sales of its own products.</i> <br><br>  In the first part of the series of articles on sales, I would like to reveal a trend that has smoothly moved from offline sales to online.  So, the <b>problem of modern sellers is that they do not see their customers,</b> or pretend to see.  What does this mean? <br><br>  A couple of months ago I saw one video in which the speaker addressed the listener with the question: what thought does a person have when he sees that the seller approaches him?  Try to answer this question yourself.  If you decide that the correct answer is ‚ÄúOh, no, now I will again offer and sell something, as everyone is sick‚Äù, then you will be right.  Imagine yourself in the place of any client who has come to any outlet.  Yes, why submit, you probably yourself recently went to some store (no matter if it is a fruit pavilion or a home appliances shop).  And what do you hear first?

      <b><i>- to you something to prompt?</i></b> <br>  The most familiar question that we hear all the time.  Now, by the way, it has also appeared on the Internet - constantly pop-up windows from all sides ‚ÄúHello.  Ask your questions and we will answer you. "  Perhaps, in the future, I don‚Äôt strongly clutter the article with offline versus online comparisons, all further text will be viewed in the context of a regular offline store, but you should also remember that the problems described are fully projected onto online projects. <br><br>  <b><i>- Ask what interests you?</i></b> <br>  Why is this question bad?  The fact that from the first seconds of your appearance in the store (read: on the site), the seller showed that he does not see what kind of customer you are.  Because such a question is suitable only for one type of buyers (visitors) - the hot one.  What other kinds of customers are there and how to ‚Äúsee‚Äù them?  And in general, is this necessary? <br><br>  Let's imagine how you can make this or that purchase (to make this or that order)?  There are three options: <br><br>  <b>1. You know exactly what you need.</b>  Brand, model, cost - all the data is in your head, you are constantly voicing it for yourself and understand what you need.  Iphone 32 gb white, no more than 45,000 rubles.  Or a regular bath for a new apartment.  Or British Fold Cat.  The key parameter - you know exactly what you need.  In this case, the question of the seller "What interests you" will be on the one hand, just the way.  But at the same time, the seller turns into an ordinary cashier who carries a barcode through the cash register scanner, takes money from you and gives you the necessary thing. <br><br>  <b>2. You are just thinking</b> about buying a new phone.  Or just moved to a new apartment.  Or your girlfriend gave a hint that she wants some living creatures to go home.  Then, when you visit the specialty stores, the ever-sounding question ‚Äúwill you suggest something?‚Äù Or the ‚ÄúAsk‚Äù seller‚Äôs requirement will only disturb you and cause a clear negative to the store and the seller in particular. <br><br>  <b>3. You do not think about buying a</b> phone, new plumbing or a fluffy friend.  In this case, such questions of the seller that I wrote above, he will not even have time to ask, because in your eyes there is not a drop of interest in the products of the seller. <br><br>  The above cases of purchase (or non-purchase) relate to three types of customers: respectively, hot, warm and cold.  First, by the way, the smallest number of all buyers (I think you should not explain the reason for this phenomenon).  Most often, we either know about what we need, or (more often), do not think at all to make any transactions. <br><br>  In the second and in the third case, the seller must come on the scene, who sees his clients and can distinguish them.  When the seller recognizes the type of buyer in a person, the sale process becomes profitable for both parties, which entails additional advantages for the seller (I will talk about the importance of repeat customers separately). <br><br>  How to get to the "warm" client?  First of all, it should be said that it is much easier to do this than to the cold.  For a warm customer, the question of who to give his money to is in second place - first of all, he needs to choose a product.  This is where sales technology will help, which I will also discuss in the next article, but you yourself can familiarize yourself with the basic fundamentals of sales technology. <br><br>  With cold customers, everything is much more interesting.  Their distinguishing feature is that in principle they do not think about the purchase, and they will immediately accept any offer with hostility.  But for them, too, there is its own sales technology, which I will write about later. <br><br>  By the way, it is also necessary to be able to work with ‚Äúhot‚Äù clients, but this is also in the next article. <br>  In the same article, I said that the seller should first of all do in order to sell and not turn away buyers from himself.  <b>Stop asking questions from customers.</b>  Ask them yourself. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/289830/">https://habr.com/ru/post/289830/</a></p>
