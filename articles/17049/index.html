I agree.  it is paramount.  but so many people are nostalgic.  and nostalgia is manifested in everything.  besides, one cannot say that musical statistics is uninteresting statistics. <br>  did not display an answer.  but there are reflections.  little thoughts.

      So, abandon the specialized recording formats.  What is it that we have there?  * .txt?  the most <br>  the idea is as follows - the logs of the player being played in the player, including the logs of the radio, lead to a single view.  easiest in time.  There are a number of common methods for displaying time.  put it in the first place.  translate text into a tabular form and sort alphabetically - a small task. <br>  stumble, however, on the stone - tags.  why not neglect, for the sake of a good cause?  you personally need tags, if you are interested - what is it, what year and so on.  - you will do it.  but for logging and processing file names will be safer. <br><br>  so, with the help of tag &amp; rename we translate all the names of the files to one type (at least artist - title - album [year]).  now having the data we can know whom, when and in what quantities we dried.  simple programming can give skriptik) I really do not remember - a few variables, arrays.  it's easy, I guess. <br>  but further - a stupor.  there is statistics, but in a non-noble kind.  there would have to illuminate it with the last.fm interface or something else that is nice (nice looking) to come up with.  It should not be a local program, it seems to me.  not that time, you know.  non-universally.  Yes, and there are similar options. <br><br>  *(footnote) <br>  separately I want to say about Internet radio.  To write to the statistics all that is played on a particular radio station is a controversial need.  here you need a flexible approach.  maybe some button to press on the track you like so that it goes to the log, maybe something else.  as for me, listening to, for example, soma.fm (specific two radio stations), I can say that I can safely include everything in the statistics, whatever is played on the air.  and, contrary to the potential reproaches, I will call this part of the statistics objective for myself.  because at some moments I put the music from the hard drive, at some moments I turn on the radio. <br><br>  The purpose of the text is to hear opinions and, perhaps, options. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/17049/">https://habr.com/ru/post/17049/</a></p>
