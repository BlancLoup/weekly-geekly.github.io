  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to set a goal, where to start</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  With a cup!  When developing plans or key indicators or business processes, the consultants suggest setting a goal for the beginning, and then everything will go by itself.  That's right, only one nuance - for some reason it is very difficult to set these very goals.  As soon as you put a few sheets of paper with a pen in front of you, somehow you immediately want to drink coffee, smoke someone, or, to be honest, even from your desk, you immediately want to wipe the dust and put it all on the shelves.  In general, out of nowhere, a lot of reasons are taken to get up from the table. <br><br><img src="http://son.kiev.ua/files/store_apendix_big2890_3375.jpg"><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  If this is so, then it is logical to assume that there is an obstacle that prompts to push this activity aside.  In order to get close to it (the obstacle) for a start, let's try to practice on what already has its purpose, for example, on the cup. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      So, the task of the task: What is the purpose of the cup itself?  Usually, this question gives an instant answer: "To drink from it."  But no, I answered immediately when I asked myself this question for the first time.  It is my goal to quench my thirst, not the cup itself.  After about thirty minutes, my inflamed intellect was on the verge of life and death, when suddenly enlightenment descended!  After a few minutes of euphoria, the clarified mind clearly gave the wording.  The purpose of the cup is to hold at a certain point in space, substances with a missing form. <br><br>  Now, having in the presence of this formulation of the object's purpose, one can clearly know whether this cup corresponds to its purpose or not.  In other words, can it keep shapeless substances in space or not.  For example, if there is a crack and the liquid completely flows out of it within a minute, then it is obvious that the degree of destination, and accordingly the value of the cup is small.  We set the goal: "To increase the value of the cup" or "To glue the cup"!  Further tasks are lined up by themselves, in fact, as promised by business consultants.  By the way, if the goal is formulated correctly, then plans and tasks begin to be born by themselves, just have time to write it down.  An example, of course, has been brought to an extreme, but the main thing is to see behind all this the fundamental principle: ‚ÄúThe goal can be set if two things are known.‚Äù  The first is the current state of the area or object.  The second is the purpose of the area or object, i.e.  perfect shape. <br><br>  Let us consider an example from practice, based on the "cup" principle.  There is an enterprise with the main purpose: to provide products that are suitable for use according to their functional and aesthetic characteristics.  However, sometimes for various reasons, products are provided so that they need to be improved.  It turns out that the client expected the declared quality but did not receive it for his money.  Consequently, it is necessary to create a unit, which in fact will restore the exchange disturbed by the enterprise.  For example, a division of reclamations.  We formulate the objective of the reclamations division: ‚ÄúTo restore the broken exchange with customers‚Äù.  Having this formulation, it is possible not only to accurately determine the value of a given unit over time (how efficiently the exchange is restored), but also to clearly state its business processes, using, for example, the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/pm/113640/">‚Äúscrambled eggs‚Äù</a> principle. <br><br>  For those who want to train their mind - try to formulate the purpose: 1. Shaving gel.  2. Towel.  3. Broom. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/114103/">https://habr.com/ru/post/114103/</a></p>
