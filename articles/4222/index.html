  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Banner on "Yandex" is sold in a new way</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Where to find the main banner Runet?  Obviously, at its highest rating site - the main <a href="http://www.yandex.ru/">"Yandex"</a> .  Placing an advertising module 728 √ó 90, which appears from time to time under the search cell, is not cheap.  But the audience coverage of such advertising is wide, it is beyond doubt.  Yandex itself <a href="">calls</a> beautiful round numbers: the banner on the start page sees over 5 million people a week, during which time ads are shown more than 40 million times. <br><br>  Recently, Yandex and its selling agency, <a href="http://www.imho.ru/">IMHO VI,</a> announced a new sale scheme for the ‚Äúmain banner of the Russian Internet,‚Äù reports <a href="http://www.mediarevolution.ru/">MediaRevolution</a> .  Previously, this position was sold as ‚Äústatic‚Äù - one advertiser was placed, whose banner was seen by any visitor of the search engine.  ‚ÄúWe deliberately do not overload our main page with advertising, because we do not believe that people going to Yandex come to see banners,‚Äù says the company.  ‚ÄúThus, our users receive a convenient service, and advertisers receive an exclusive quality product.‚Äù <br><br>  However, recently, the company's advertising policy has changed somewhat.  Banner places have not increased - on the main portal there is still only one place reserved for advertising.  The model of banner display itself evolved: now the advertisement will be broadcast dynamically.  That is, on the title page of the search engine in the same position will be replaced by banners of several advertisers.

      But this time, apparently, few will be able to buy the place: Yandex continues to insist that a decent advertising effect is achievable only with a large-scale campaign, and still sells advertising "wholesale", relying on the category of "coverage" - when the advertiser decides to order advertising in the position in question, he will be offered to show it, for example, 7 million people. <br><br>  According to MediaRevolution, this model is close to the sales scheme for television advertising on <a href="http://www.grp.ru/">GRP</a> . <br><br>  Habrahabr addressed several questions on the topic to Alexey Tretyakov, Yandex Commercial Director. <br><br>  <b>Why was it decided to sell "reach"?</b>  <b>How can this model be determined?</b> <br><br>  One of the advantages of Yandex as an advertising platform and, in particular, the advantage of its main page is its audience.  It is important for us to provide customers with the opportunity to use it.  For this, and developed a new system. <br><br>  Strictly speaking, we do not sell ‚Äúcoverage‚Äù in its pure form.  The sale is still a certain amount of impressions.  But now we give a forecast of coverage on the basis of our new display mechanism.  And the client sees what kind of audience he buys. <br><br>  In principle, ‚Äúcoverage‚Äù (in this review) was sold before - in particular, with static placements: when placed for a fixed period (for example, a week), the advertiser received in the commercial offer a forecast of coverage made on the basis of attendance statistics of this page. <br><br>  And the ‚Äúnovelty‚Äù of the introduced system of impressions is in the possibility of forecasting coverage with dynamic placement, including with several simultaneously running campaigns. <br><br>  I note that, in addition to static placements, on Yandex, it has long been possible to limit the number of times your banner is shown to each specific visitor, which also allows you to optimize your reach. <br><br>  <b>Why is the chosen sale scheme effective for the advertiser?</b> <br><br>  There are two reasons: <br><br>  The first is marketing: on the one hand, an advertiser interested in a large audience needs to provide it.  And the new system allows you to do this for several simultaneously running client placements in the best possible way. <br><br>  The second is economic: when buying traffic in large volumes, the price of contact becomes much more affordable. <br><br>  <b>Can advertising on Yandex be just as useful to a client if it becomes possible to buy it in smaller quantities?</b> <br><br>  By placing advertisements in small volumes, the client will receive neither coverage nor simply a noticeable result (imagine if you place ads on TV with the condition of showing one video a day).  Therefore, we ‚Äúdiscourage‚Äù customers from doing this (the minimum package offered is 10% of weekly traffic on the main Yandex; this is quite a large offer, and when you buy 40% of traffic, the price is almost twice lower than the base cost of a thousand impressions). <br><br>  <b>What do you think, for which category of advertisers will the model chosen by Yandex be effective?</b> <br><br>  Advertising on the main page - for the largest companies.  These are FMCG and mass premium products (for example, cars and banking services).  At the same time, the new sales model is particularly beneficial (from an economic point of view) for companies engaged in the promotion of several sub-brands or products at the same time. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/4222/">https://habr.com/ru/post/4222/</a></p>
