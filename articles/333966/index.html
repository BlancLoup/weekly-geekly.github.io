  <section class="page js-page"><h1>When in Russia to wait for 5G</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Already today it is clear that the introduction of 5G will change our world.  ‚ÄúSmart Homes‚Äù and ‚ÄúSmart Cities‚Äù, autopilot systems and telepresence, holographic calls, augmented and virtual reality services, as well as a gigantic fleet of various sensors and devices will fill the life of the inhabitant.  And all this is our near future.  We have repeatedly tested the capabilities of 5G and achieved a mobile data transfer rate of 25 Gbit / s.  We asked the expert of the MTS radio access network department Alexey Maslov to tell how the 5G networks will work and when we will wait for the appearance of the first devices supporting the fifth generation networks. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3cf/6a7/2e4/3cf6a72e485a5677ec0b7dfbb0d51be5.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Hello everybody.  I'll start with what fundamentally 5G differs from LTE.  So, the differences are as follows: <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  At higher peak speeds: 12-fold advantage over LTE-Advanced Pro, and almost 500-fold versus 3G; <br>  ‚éØ in better spectral efficiency: 1.5 times and 7 times more efficient than LTE-Advanced Pro and 3G, respectively, for DL ‚Äã‚Äã(downlink); <br>  ‚éØ reduction of delays in the radio access subsystem by a couple of orders: 0.5 ms for URLLC ultra-reliable communication services and 4 ms for high-speed eMBB communication services against tens / hundreds of ms in LTE / 3G; <br>  ‚éØ maximum density of devices connected to the network of 1 000 000 devices / km2 in urban conditions, and the possibility of operation of autonomous sensors for at least 10 years without recharging; <br>  ‚éØ in mobility support (handovers) at device speeds up to 500 km / h <br>  ‚éØ in the use of new frequency ranges from 6 to 100 GHz; <br>  ‚éØ in the use of cloud architecture / virtualization equipment 5G. <br>  These advantages can be achieved through a number of new technologies.  Some technologies have already been tested by operators, and some are still under development.

The bottom line is that we are increasing the number of transceivers at the base station.  If the classic solution is two transmitters and two receivers, then in 5G there will most likely be from 16 to 512 transmitters or more and from 16 to 512 receivers.  We will have one common lane, but separate beams will be formed for each subscriber.  We will greatly increase the efficiency of the spectrum.  This architecture will also be used on the LTE network, due to the limited frequency resource. <br><br>  Fig.2 Multi-site Coordination.  This is a coordination tool, in 5G there will be no transitions from one base station to another, that is, the subscriber will simultaneously receive the service from several base stations in his environment at once.  Part of the functionality has already been implemented in LTE. <br><br>  In fig.  3 we are talking about the fact that the subscriber may be far from the base station, but placing a small cell near the subscriber, we increase the signal level and capacity by reusing the capacity of the existing macro layer. <br><br>  In fig.  4 shows the separation of signal and user information for the subscriber.  Signal information must come to the terminal without loss, which means that it will be transmitted from the macro station, which has good coverage.  And user information, which is not so critical to the signal level, to delays, it will be transmitted from a nearby station if it is in the form of a small cell with less coverage, with less power. <br><br>  Fig.  5 - Device to device connectivity.  This is a separate direction, when the devices work directly among themselves without the participation of the operator‚Äôs network.  If the device moves out of the macro network's coverage area, it can receive coverage from the macro network through communication with a nearby terminal. <br><br>  In fig.  6 shows the changes that will occur in the radio interface when using 5G.  Here it will be possible for certain services to flexibly change the spacing between subcarriers, and, accordingly, the minimum packet transmission time depending on the used range and required service (for example, high-speed data transfer or ultra-reliable communication for Real Time services).  Also in 5G, one band will be used, that is, there will not be a fixed uplink / downlink division (lack of duplex separation), and the uplink-a and downlink-transmission will be flexibly changed depending on the required load.  That is, you can use the band much more efficiently. <br><br>  <b>Do I need to change equipment for 5G</b> <br><br>  Taking into account the fact that at the moment the 5G concept is not officially standardized and not specified, it will be possible to assess the network‚Äôs readiness for the introduction of 5G only by the beginning of 2018.  However, today MTS is preparing to introduce an intermediate 5G standard called NSA 5G NR (Non-Standalone 5G New Radio), which will use the existing LTE radio subsystem and the existing network core as anchor systems for managing mobility and coverage. 5G.  At the same time, the 5G network will require the construction of a large number of base stations and the strengthening of the transport network of telecom operators in places of active consumption of traffic. <br><br>  At the first stage, we will most likely use the existing radio subsystem, network core, and transport for 5G.  But not everything is so simple.  Adding support for new bands to existing LTE technology, i.e. an increase in speed, will be due to the addition of a wider 5G band to the existing LTE standard.  All important signaling information will go through LTE, and the user, which needs a wider band, will go through 5G.  Due to this, it is possible to reuse the existing LTE infrastructure. <br><br>  But now, in principle, it is clear that the full implementation of 5G will require upgrading, installing additional equipment, increasing transport channels, and increasing the capacity of the packet cortex, in addition to the radio subsystems, where it will be necessary to install new transceivers for the new frequency range.  Computing capacity at base stations will also be increased. <br><br>  <b>Frequencies for 5G</b> <br><br>  For Russia, 5G frequencies are still unknown, and it‚Äôs not a fact that we will approve those frequencies on which the first subscriber terminals will operate.  At present, the operators have frequencies to develop 5G so far it makes no sense.  Now there is no need for this, there are no terminals and there will be no effect due to the small frequency bands.  At the WRC-19 summit in 2019, it is planned to approve the 5G bands, thereby launching commercial 5G networks can be expected no earlier than 2020. The table shows which countries will use which frequencies. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b16/b9c/3a9/b16b9c3a9d54417fcf01e96e6cdc0620.png" alt="image"><br>  In Russia, the difficulty is that the promising "European" and "American" frequencies of 5G are used by other services.  For example, in the potentially considered 3.5 GHz range, satellite services and fixed broadband access networks are now ‚Äúsitting‚Äù.  It is clear that clearing the range is not a quick and expensive thing.  At the initial stage, new frequency bands will be used for the networks of the new generation of cellular communication, and later - the existing bands of 3G / LTE technologies that were outdated by that time. <br><br>  <b>First 5G devices</b> <br><br>  At the moment there are several announcements about hardware support in 5G chipsets.  However, the first commercial 5G devices will be in 2019 - these are routers / tablets and in 2020 - smartphones.  Major equipment suppliers are already testing the pre-standard version 5G (Pre-5G) in the 28 GHz range on the markets in the USA and South Korea, primarily for fixed access in home territories.  Just for this, US operators are trying to speed up the approval of the first 5G specifications.  In March 2018 it is planned to approve the pre-release. <br><br>  <b>The first tests 5G</b> <br><br>  MTS is planning a 5G demonstration at the 2018 FIFA World Cup.  By the time it is held, the first 5G specifications will have already been accepted and tested on the network of US operators and at the Winter Olympic Games in South Korea at 28 GHz.  This will create the first samples of base stations and 5G terminals for this range.  Probably, on the same principle, we will test 5G in Russia during the 2018 World Cup.  Given that the additional spectrum for 5G will be determined at WRC-19 in the autumn of 2019, the full implementation of 5G will be no earlier than 2020. <br><br>  Until the completion of 5G standardization, we will test innovative technology solutions to be ready for the introduction of new technology after the regulator decides to use the low and high frequency bands for 5G (technological neutrality of the existing 5G bands, holding auctions). <br><br>  For example, the other day we successfully completed testing LAA / LBT technology for combining frequencies of LTE and unlicensed spectrum of Wi-Fi networks.  The new technology will find application in 5G networks and will allow increasing data transmission speeds when simultaneously operating in the same frequency range of both the base station of the telecommunications operator and devices in different local networks.  The first test using the Pico RBS 6402 pico base station involved two frequency bands: 10 MHz in the LTE 1800 MHz band and 20 MHz in the 5 GHz band of the unlicensed spectrum used in Wi-Fi networks.  Tests demonstrated data transfer speeds in the operator's LTE network up to 206 Mbit / s with a free Wi-Fi network and up to 145 Mbit / s with a loaded Wi-Fi network.  In the second test, the Huawei Lampsite pico base station pRRU3911 used three frequency bands: 15 MHz in the LTE 1800 MHz band and 2x20 MHz in the 5 GHz band of the unlicensed Wi-Fi spectrum.  The data transfer rate in the operator's LTE network reached 411 Mbit / s without using LBT technology, and with LBT on, 373 Mbit / s with free Wi-Fi and 297 Mbit / s with loaded Wi-Fi. <br><br>  <b>What operators live now</b> <br><br>  At the moment, telecom operators need to solve the problem of ‚Äúdigital inequality‚Äù - by the end of 2019, the ‚Äúbig four‚Äù must fulfill licensing obligations for the deployment of LTE networks in all regions of Russia.  This means that it is necessary to further expand the coverage, multiply the network bandwidth and introduce new LTE-Advanced Pro technologies (Gigabit LTE, NB-IoT, LAA) to meet current market needs. <br><br>  To run 5G, first of all, there should be a need for high-speed communication services (up to 20 Gbit / s), ultra-low delays (up to 4 ms), high-capacity networks (1,000,000 devices / km2). <br><br>  <b>What will happen to the networks of the previous generation</b> <br><br>  As I said, the first 5G networks within 3GPP are considering an architecture in which 5G base stations will work in conjunction with LTE base stations on common equipment (Non-Standalone, NSA).  In this case, the 5G carrier in the new range will be used only for user traffic, and the control traffic will be transmitted through the carrier of the LTE base station.  That is, the first 5G terminals will be with LTE support.  There will be no impact on existing users without 5G support, since the penetration of terminals will be low.  Later, the 5G terminals will smoothly flush the terminals with support for only old technologies, as it is now with LTE terminals. <br><br>  Nevertheless, it will not be possible to turn off the 2G network completely until 2025 - until the terminals with support for only 2G disappear on the network.  First of all, it refers to the M2M 2G terminals.  The prospect of disconnecting the 3G network is more likely than 2G, but it is also possible with very low penetration of terminals that support only 3G. <cut></cut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/333966/">https://habr.com/ru/post/333966/</a></p>
