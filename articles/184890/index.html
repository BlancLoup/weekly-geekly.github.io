  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to choose a Unified Communication System</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In my last article, I wrote about the price characteristics of IP telephony solutions and Unified Communication (UC) <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/184228/">habrahabr.ru/post/184228</a> .  Today I will try to highlight the general issues relating to the choice of the UC system and what you should pay attention to when choosing. <br>  Most manufacturers of telecommunications equipment provide UC tools, including services such as chat, phone call, voice mail, video / audio conferences.  With the development of various types of gadgets such as tablets and smartphones, the emphasis on their use is becoming increasingly popular in combination with UC.  Support for these devices and a set of possibilities with their use are likely to become the main ‚Äúbattlefield‚Äù of manufacturers.  However, stationary video conferencing and the possibility of sharing a desktop computer, in the same way the demand UC application.  Another significant vector in the development of UC is various cloud applications included under licenses or on the basis of another type of policies, as well as flexible migration between cloud and intra-corporate use.  Probably in the near future we will see a combination of such products as UC and Software as a Service (SAAS), offered on the one hand by equipment manufacturers and on the other hand by service providers. <br>  UC systems do not have to be closed on themselves, even if the manufacturer provides the whole range of solutions by itself.  They must support integration with the outside world through the most common protocols such as SIP, XMPP, etc. <br>  Another key feature of a successful UC system is its intuitive use.  At the dawn of mobile phones, Nokia has won its customers with the simplicity and obviousness of using various functions of the phone.  The same can be said today about UC. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  It is important to understand that UC is an environment that combines various services (chat, voice, video, fax, etc.) on the one hand, and access devices (desktop computer, mobile phone, fax machine, tablet, smartphone, etc.) on the other hand, and transfer information between them through all existing communication channels.  To some extent, UC is a translator of information between different devices using different media.  Most manufacturers assemble their communications devices, often acquired on the basis of OEM agreements from third-party companies, but the need to coexist with competitive equipment is important for many organizations.  Of course, the use of a multivendor solution places on the shoulders of the integrator great difficulties in the compatibility of equipment, but this often provides economic benefits, and sometimes it is simply necessary because of the user's commitment and habits in using terminal equipment.  An important parameter when choosing a manufacturer is its stability in the market.  At the same time, if the company is engaged only in this area, and has at least 5 years of positive reputation (this can be seen in the growth of sales and / or profits), it should be given preference at all equal.  If UC is a by-product, and acts as a catalyst for sales of the main product, then it is worthwhile to carefully consider such a decision.  The essential feature of UC is that this product should always be customized for a specific user.  This begins with the assignment of user internal numbers, integration with their phone and email databases, the services used in the company, such as faxes or WEB training, and further to the distribution / limitation of services used by different groups of employees.  Thus, the role of a competent integrator increases many times.  Now the integrator is not only the one who ‚Äúincludes everything‚Äù, but also the one who plans user groups, assigns them an Access Control List (ACL) and supports the functionality of the entire complex.  Even if the company has a trained specialist in its staff who can create a new user, it will be a very expensive pleasure to keep a staff who will be able to respond to the changing components of the system.  And they will necessarily change, because UC is called to bring everything together for everyone.  Corporate business uses UC to connect its business units.  But in this case, the cost of UC, as a rule, does not include the price of network upgrading, which, as a rule, is necessary for a video conference.  In this case, it will be important to have different groups of users entitled to use internal telephony and video conferencing separately.  In the latter case, it may be advantageous to use cloud solutions with a service on request UCaaS. <br>  This article is written to make it easier for users to navigate the functionality they need and select a specific UC supplier by the following four criteria: <br><ul><li>  Complete UCC solution with more telephony focus </li><li>  Complete UCC solution with more emphasis on cooperation </li><li>  Basic UCC solution integrated with competitors equipment </li><li>  Integrated local and cloud services </li></ul><br>  Whatever criterion is chosen, the main argument for using UC will be to increase employee productivity, facilitate the tasks they perform and, as a result, gain a competitive advantage in work.  UC is constantly evolving and all new services are included under this concept.  This article discusses the nine most important functions of UC: <br><ul><li>  Telephony, which includes a fixed phone, integration with classic PBX, mobile phones, software clients, applications on smartphones and video calls. </li><li>  Conference call, including audio, video and WEB conference.  The conference should have virtual rooms, WEB cameras and computer desktop sharing. </li><li>  Messages and chat.  Integration with email and text messaging via UC Unified Interface </li><li>  Presence.  This is an opportunity to know the static state of the subscriber, for example, do not disturb, at a meeting, etc., as well as dynamic states, for example, the receiver is picked up, ringing, talking.  The presence also includes geolocation.  All this information should be obtained from all components of the UC system, such as a landline and mobile phone, software client, etc. </li><li>  Various communication clients.  It is the ability to provide information exchange with various devices, including WEB and mobile devices, as well as landline phones, SIP phones, softphones for different operating systems and native smartphone applications.  For many companies, WebRTC support will also become mandatory. </li><li>  Compatibility and integration.  The ability to integrate UC applications with other products, such as CRM, email clients, etc. This is achieved by supporting TAPI, W-TAPI, and other means and tools.  In some cases, the integration tools can be embedded in the settings, for example, in the case of an incoming call, a pre-configured WEB page of the CRM system appears, which will immediately increase the efficiency of the call center. </li><li>  Control.  Centralized system management with the ability to analyze and configure all communication elements.  The control system should have automatic recognition of new elements on the network, loading the configuration and updating them. </li><li>  Cloud solutions are the ability to use part of the functionality locally in a company and part remotely in cloudy space.  It should also allow companies to change licensing and use systems. </li><li>  Mobilization support is the ability to integrate mobile devices into a single system, including presence, pager, voice and video, conferences, and desktop sharing of a desktop computer. </li></ul><br><br><h5>  Use cases </h5><br>  Enterprises develop their infrastructure gradually, depending on growing needs and in accordance with the budget.  As a result, UC is presented in a large price range, but, as a rule, this can be reduced to one of the four cases described. <br>  Complete UCC solution with more emphasis on telephony.  Used by large and medium organizations to improve the efficiency of voice infrastructure.  It fits well with the predicted development of related IT areas. <br>  A complete UCC solution with more emphasis on cooperation.  Medium and large companies are also used to integrate staff and program interactions.  The manual focuses on conferencing, fax server, e-mail, chat and their integration with other applications.  Integration with telephony is also useful, but is not considered as important. <br>  Basic UCC solution integrated with competitors' equipment.  In this decision, there is a desire to preserve the existing "zoo" of equipment and programs, combining it in one environment. <br>  Integrated solution of local and cloud services.  The solution allows the company to use part of advanced services without waiting for the development of its own communications infrastructure.  Companies will be interested in reliable storage of information in the cloud, and in some cases, its protection from sanctions by law enforcement agencies.  At the same time, the flexibility of moving between local and cloud use is quite significant.  Below is a table of statistics on the use of basic services for these 4 variants of use made by Gartner for July 2013. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2f5/ecc/3b7/2f5ecc3b7d2a3b2ab8843b337f26884b.png" alt="image"><br>  Equipment manufacturers are included in the analysis below, based on the following criteria: <br>  The manufacturer must have functionality on the market in 4 or more UC functions, from the list provided in the table above.  The very presence in the market can manifest itself in one of two ways - the actual market share occupied by the manufacturer or various innovations in this area. <br>  The product must have corporate implementations with links and the possibility of contact with the user. <br>  The proposed solution should be complete and cover all areas of UC, even if part of the proposed solutions are taken as third-party solutions. <br><br><h5>  Critical assessment of opportunities </h5><br>  Each manufacturer was rated by Gartner on a 5-point scale and analysis was conducted for 13 manufacturers: Alcatel, Lucent, Avaya, Aastra, Cisco, Huawei Technologies, IBM, Interactive Intelligence, NEC, ShoreTel, Microsoft, Mitel, Siemens Enterprise Communications, Toshiba.  Below is a table and a schedule of their evaluation.

Viability is the manufacturer's assessment of the support of a solution during its life cycle.  Four key indicators include this assessment: strategy, support, execution and investment.  The strategy determines how this decision fits into the overall strategy of the company, its marketing aspirations and the overall business direction.  Support includes technical quality and openness / ease of working with clients.  Execution reflects the structure of the manufacturer, as well as the process of sales, marketing, prices and negotiations.  Investments determine the financial health of the manufacturer and its willingness to expand this area.  Each item is rated on a 5-point scale.  Below is a summary table of the assessment of viability. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ab0/5d1/ce3/ab05d1ce387e255a262506ac8329d885.png"><br><br>  The evaluation graph, taking into account the viability, is presented below and is shown below in 4 main areas of application. <br><br><img src="http://habrastorage.org/storage2/e42/669/3c3/e426693c3b85a003df93cbb3e498659e.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/736/a0d/fad/736a0dfadfda32e88698781460c4ee8f.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/fc9/361/63f/fc936163fe99f63eddb7efe2e9059950.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a82/f41/496/a82f414967aad5d1d65a1706553dbe58.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/bee/3e0/5e5/bee3e05e57502e60a3584b9011f5d395.png"><br><br><h5>  Manufacturers </h5><br><h6>  Aastra Technologies </h6><br>  BluStar - Aastra product combines various devices from personal computers to tablets and smartphones to the UC system.
