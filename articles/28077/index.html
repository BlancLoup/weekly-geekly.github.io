  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Self Interview</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <b>Having sufficient experience in the analysis of today's Internet resources, I came to the conclusion that I am quite able to competently answer key questions related to today's super-fast development of social networks in Runet.</b>  <b>And therefore - we ask and ... we answer.</b> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>What is attractive to users of social networks?</b>  <b>Is it possible to create an average user image of social networks?</b>  <b>How many such services can be registered by one person?</b>  <b>How many of them are actively used, for what?</b> <br><br>  Social networks are like a national dance, each nation has its own, with its own characteristics and preferences.  The architecture of this type of web services, their methods of use, and the average user is also in each country and for each social network - their own.  If we talk about the country of the former social.  camps, social networks of a general nature rule here, which, in general, serve for simple communication on the Internet.  The most popular and successful representatives of the industry, Odnoklassniki and V Kontakte, have a nostalgic color.  This means that they are designed to restore the broken bonds of middle-aged people.  In some ways, these connections are really restored, you find ‚Äúthat red-haired guy from the second year‚Äù or ‚Äúfirst love‚Äù, but, often, it does not go further than sharing photos and mutual ‚Äúfrending‚Äù.  People tend to change very much over the past decades, but to understand that your first love is no longer so romantic and fresh, not everyone is ready.  We were taught to live with memories and fantasies for 70 years! <br><br>  Users of domestic social networks can be divided into four groups.  In this regard, it is possible to determine the number of parallel registrations in competing projects, intensity of use, durability and current account activity, etc. <br><ol><li>  <b>Geeky</b>  These are technically advanced Internet users who test the very latest to stay on the cutting edge of events.  They are not active users of social networks (due to some paranoia, which is a consequence of the in-depth knowledge of "how it all works").  The age of geeks is very different, from a teenager to a schoolboy to a 50-year-old professor.  These people have accounts in every conceivable social network, and their circle of friends is identical everywhere. </li><li>  <b>Children and teenagers.</b>  Very active users of social networks.  They may have equally active accounts in Odnoklassniki and in Vkontakte.  Often, networks are the only way to communicate on the Internet, even with classmates.  They say that communication built social.  networks are so intense that they easily replace instant messaging services. </li><li>  Middle-aged <b>working people</b> (of course, ‚Äúoffice plankton‚Äù).  Despite the prohibitions in many organizations on the use of social.  networks, it does not prevent workers from using networks from cell phones, as well as in other ways.  They are also very active users of services, especially for personal communication, which it is preferable not to take into the framework of corporate communications.  These users are very dismissive of networks in which they do not have an account, and therefore are limited to participation in 1-2 networks. </li></ol><br>  <b>What are the future prospects and directions of development (monetization, development of narrow professional communities ...) social networks?</b>  <b>How do you look at the merging of such networks?</b>  <b>Will the development of 3D-interfaces affect social networks?</b>

      As for the topic of monetization of social networks, it is very relevant and concerns both the network holders and each user individually (mostly due to the scrupulousness of the information stored there).  Western social networks, which are several steps ahead of ours, clearly outlining the prospects for monetization, are currently using banner ads to make money at numerous shows.  After all, the beauty of a social network is that the average user generates about 100 ad impressions per day.  Now transfer these numbers to millions of armies of users.  The numbers are amazing!  And this is only the visible part of the iceberg.  Alternative monetization methods often border on concepts of ethics and morality.  The existence of alternative monetization is questioned by few, but there are not enough objective facts to blame the creators and holders of the service. <br><br>  No one bothers to make profit networks, providing content services and additional services.  You know that members of the most popular social network in Latvia pay for additional photos, for large posts ... and almost everything!  By the way, Odnoklassniki successfully use SMS-payment for their additional services. <br><br>  The development of narrow communities in social networks of a general nature does not make sense, since people come here for emotions and relaxation, and not for knowledge.  Information groups are highly developed in professional social networks, such as <a href="http://roiber.ru/articles/10">‚ÄúMy Circle‚Äù, ‚ÄúPro2‚Äù</a> . <br><br>  The question of combining accounts in social networks usually worries everyone except the owners of the two or three most popular networks in the region.  In fact, there is even a <a href="http://internetno.net/2008/02/04/gsg/">Google Social Graph</a> platform that should combine user accounts across different networks, blogs, etc.  This is just the case for the lush presentation. <br><br>  As for the 3D interfaces, there is still no normal viable implementation on desktop computers.  And where is this with social networks?  Scare people? <br><br>  <b>How successful are Russian social networks (Odnoklassniki, Vkontakte ...)?</b>  <b>What development path have they chosen for themselves and what is the dynamics of their development?</b>  <b>How dangerous are foreign social networks for Russian players?</b> <br><br>  I don‚Äôt think that the development path of Odnoklassniki or Vkontakte will change dramatically in the next couple of years.  The Internet goes to the regions, media accessible to the masses is written about the media, people talk about them on the radio and make programs on TV, even in movies and books there are mentions about, for example, Odnoklassniki.  Therefore, the audience will grow, maybe not as explosively as in the central cities (due to the viral effect), but will definitely grow.  Moreover, within the networks, the participants' desire to be noticed will begin to increase, which will inevitably lead to the appearance of local stars of such magnitude that they will be recognized on the street.  On this network can play, promoting and producing such "talent" on TV, in the press, etc., thereby, promoting its service and making it more and more popular. <br><br>  As for the arrival of foreign social networks, even if they are Russified, this is not a threat to the leaders.  Judge for yourself: for half a year the most popular social network in the world - MySpace - has a Russian version, but the activity in its Russian-speaking segment is so small that it is senseless to consider it as a competitor to market leaders in the near future.  The release of the second popular network Facebook is about to happen, and we will observe with interest how relations will develop in this highly competitive and dynamically developing market. <br><br>  Vyacheslav Baransky <br>  <strong>Source: <u><a href="http://roiber.ru/articles/">Royber PC</a></u></strong> <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/28077/">https://habr.com/ru/post/28077/</a></p>
