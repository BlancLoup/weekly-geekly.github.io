We offer eight options for every taste. <br><br>  <b>1.</b> Die Hard Part One <br><br>  Hero Bruce Willis habitually saves the world, this time the action takes place in a skyscraper captured by terrorists.  Vacations are a great excuse to revise the classics, especially after an interesting discussion about whether Bruce could break the glass in a skyscraper or still have to call for help from Tyson. <br><br>  By the way, according to the information of ‚ÄúKinopoisk‚Äù, the skyscraper of Fox Plaza, where the shooting of ‚ÄúNut‚Äù took place, participated in other films - ‚ÄúDeadly weapons‚Äù, ‚ÄúX-Men‚Äù, ‚ÄúFight Club‚Äù, etc. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d4c/2a8/bf4/d4c2a8bf411e475d8f1d15bb2da4a598.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Fox plaza</i> <br><br>  <b>2.</b> The Lord of the Rings, three parts <br><br>  It is difficult to find a better movie for the winter holidays than this saga.  From architectural masterpieces - the tower of Sauron in Barad-Dur, Saruman in Isengard and an excellent observation platform in the residence of Elrond in Rivendell.  Interestingly, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Mordor Tower inspired architects to build a real skyscraper - in 2015, the Tower of Sauron - the Al-Nur skyscraper, began to be built in Casablanca.  It should be the tallest structure in Africa - the height will be 540 meters.  According to the plan, this should symbolize the unification of 54 countries of the black continent.  How can you not remember "One ring to rule all ...".  However, someone who, and we for examples to go to Africa is not necessary.  During the presentation of the OKO skyscraper in Moscow City, you could download the Junaio application and scan a QR count to bring it to the tower to see the Sauron eye on the roof of the high-rise building.  From the installation of a real object had <a href="http://www.msk.kp.ru/daily/26320.7/3199067/">to</a> be <a href="http://www.msk.kp.ru/daily/26320.7/3199067/">abandoned</a> due to the agitated public. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3d1/6d7/b29/3d16d7b29f7c472b812c018ecd21f9ec.jpeg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Al-nur</i> <br><br>  <b>3.</b> Rising Hell (1974) <br>  A film about a fire in a skyscraper.  The construction company saved on security systems, the architect who designed the building tries to save the people inside it.  From a technical point of view, the film is of course outdated - on the frames you can see, for example, a control room with a ‚Äúmanual‚Äù building management system, a fire system with hoses.  The role of the fire elevator is played by the panoramic cabin on the outer wall of the building.  Now, of course, they don‚Äôt build it this way - the fireman‚Äôs order, which sounds at the end of the film, can be considered fulfilled. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1fd/9f4/a9f/1fd9f4a9f1494b92a870432f809f2095.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>4.</b> Raid <br><br>  At the Toronto Film Festival (2011), he is recognized as one of the best action films of the decade.  The scene of the action is a 30-story building, the shooting took place in a real abandoned high-rise building.  The house acts not as a decoration, but as one of the heroes with its own character and personality. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/91b/f06/dbd/91bf06dbd8204560b38cad7fa2449ced.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>5.</b> Walk (2015) <br><br>  The film is based on a real story about Philippe Petit, a French street tightrope walker.  He became famous after August 7, 1974, passed along a tightrope stretched between the twin towers in New York.  The height of the ‚Äúwalk‚Äù is 400 meters, there is no insurance.  An exciting story about man and height. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/140/6fa/8fa/1406fa8fa6e841c7a3a5ca8d279b1ed2.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>6.</b> 1408 <br><br>  Horror based on the novel by Stephen King, who in turn was inspired by the story of the parapsychologist Christopher Chaikon.  The prototype, Chaikon, was hunting for a ghost in the Hotel Del Colorado, in room 3502. Del Colorado, by the way, exists to this day, attracting guests including the hope to take a picture of the "ghost."  But back to the film.  The shooting took place in New York, the role of the scary hotel (here it is called ‚ÄúDolphin‚Äù) is ‚Äúplayed‚Äù by the Roosevelt Hotel.  In addition to the history itself, the interiors of the New York skyscraper and a panoramic view from the window of a bad room deserve attention. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b6c/d47/36b/b6cd4736ba5e474e951b9a26c2c8af81.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>High-rise hotel "Roosevelt", "playing" in the film</i> <br><br>  <b>7.</b> Scientific films about the skyscrapers of the Discovery TV channel.  One of the most interesting is about the construction of Shard in London (for example, how the builders managed to arrange the foundation among the dense buildings and taking into account the subway tunnels).  Among the films is dedicated to the Moscow tower "Federation". <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a4c/657/47c/a4c65747cc5c4de889a4a11f7a777933.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>"Federation" in Moscow City</i> <br><br>  <b>8.</b> The popular science series ‚ÄúMegacolations‚Äù from National Geographic. <br>  A total of 6 seasons, 7 series devoted to skyscrapers.  Among the main characters are the Petronas Towers (the headquarters of the oil company of the same name in Kuala Lumpur, the tallest "twins" in the world), Burj Al Arab (333 meters, built on artificial alluvial ground), the World Financial Center in Shanghai ( The best skyscraper of 2008, for a long time was the record holder for the highest observation platform in the world - 472 meters), Aldar HQ (winner of the award for the best futuristic design of 2008. The world's first round-shaped skyscraper), Guangzhou TV tower (the highest TV tower in world) and others. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/028/d3f/3f3/028d3f3f3a184f0cb6c008287d1e32d4.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Aldar hq</i> <br><br>  - <br><br>  Of course, this is not all television and film masterpieces about skyscrapers.  We will be glad if you add in the comments other tapes about interesting skyscrapers (or maybe books?) That will help brighten up some winter evenings by the fireplace. <br><br>  Thank you for your interest in our project and see you in the New Year! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/400469/">https://habr.com/ru/post/400469/</a></p>
