  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Add QI Wireless Charging to Your Smartphone</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> A couple of months ago I became the owner of a very interesting smartphone - TCL Idol X S950 (aka Alcatel One Touch 6040D).  Today, having one of the best price / quality ratio.  I will not list all the characteristics - Google knows them.  I will dwell only on 5 "- FullHD (Sharp) - 140.4 x 67.5 x 6.99 - 120 gr. <br><br>  And everything would be fine, but I had to charge it all the same way, in the old manner, with everyday wear of a small microUSB connector. <br>  The wires have long been fed up with, and the manufacturers did not reach the standardization of wireless memory.  And here in use appeared Nexus 7, with the possibility of wireless charging, and it turned out that finally standardization arrived.  So it was decided to upgrade your smartphone with such a convenient function as wireless charging. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Since the phone is only 7mm thick, it was doubtful whether the QI-standard receiver would go inside the device. <br>  Therefore, for the beginning, I took a universal receiver, the benefit of which our eastern neighbors quickly responded to the growing demand and released one.  It is designed for in-place installation in any smartphone with a removable back cover.  It is made quite competently, but the test case has a removable back cover and, when connected to the phone, it all looks like this: <br> <a href="http://piccy.info/view3/5321558/fcdc186f7202d5ef6679511fed5688ef/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/678/791/05a/67879105adbc66f20577802281376236.jpg" alt="Piccy.info - Free Image Hosting"></a> <a href="http://i.piccy.info/a3c/2013-10-23-11-37/i8-5321558/240x160-r"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0ca/608/1c3/0ca6081c3a10b0f426bc590924d6001b.gif"></a> <br><br>  In principle - not bad, nothing sticks out.  But there are two but: <br>  1) to connect the cord, you need to pull out the charging, and the firmware that I like (MIUI) is not yet stable, i.e.  will have to do this often; <br>  2) I do not wear covers, i.e.  it would be necessary to fix the receiver on the back cover, but with the possibility of removal if necessary.

      <br>
      Therefore, I decided to check the charging process itself, and then open the phone - and implant the receiver inside.  Checked - charges, it's time to go further. <br><br>  I measured the actual thickness of the receiver itself: in the main part - 0.8 mm, in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe components there is a maximum thickening of 1.26 mm.  This led to sad thoughts (with a phone thickness of 7 mm), but the decision has already been made, and there is nowhere to retreat. <br><br>  We open the phone.  (Here, even those who already know how to do this with their left hands with their eyes closed - keep in mind that the plastic is quite soft, and the attachment ears are very thin, so open it carefully. I did it.) <br>  As he looks inside, I have repeatedly seen in photos and videos posted on the network.  An autopsy confirmed that nothing had changed there since the time of filming, respectively, there was only one question: is it much easier to solder the receiver?  At first I was thinking about the microUSB connector, but on the plus contact there was a fairly large polygon, apparently in the lower layer, and it wasn't very convenient to get soldered there.  Then the contact pads rang and I found the contacts I needed for TP. <br>  See photos, noted positive and negative contacts: <br> <a href="http://piccy.info/view3/5321543/dfaa992d0ee5b39d464b3e7293b54fef/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fa7/0fa/3fa/fa70fa3faf4cee993c1759c625f77e0d.jpg" alt="Piccy.info - Free Image Hosting"></a> <a href="http://i.piccy.info/a3c/2013-10-23-11-36/i8-5321543/240x160-r"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0ca/608/1c3/0ca6081c3a10b0f426bc590924d6001b.gif"></a> <br><br>  Then he soldered the connector from the receiver and soldered its conductors to the telephone's TP (the lead wires in the receiver are flat, which in this case is very useful).  I soldered without disconnecting the battery, which is NOT CORRECT !!!  If you repeat - be sure to disassemble the upper part and disconnect the battery. <br><br>  ... but I did not want to do this, plus I decided to check the straightness of the hands and the reliability of the circuitry used in the phone.  In general - everything went fine.  Soldered, made a coup receiver and voila: <br> <a href="http://piccy.info/view3/5321305/188a8be385a2cc1a7036a0763338f06c/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cd5/fb8/efb/cd5fb8efba88a6943f8b25de3c13d6f9.jpg" alt="Piccy.info - Free Image Hosting"></a> <a href="http://i.piccy.info/a3c/2013-10-23-11-34/i8-5321305/240x160-r"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0ca/608/1c3/0ca6081c3a10b0f426bc590924d6001b.gif"></a> <br><br>  Just a few words why.  The thing is that intuitively trying to put the phone in the center of the charging station, respectively, the receiver's antenna is also desirable, so as to be in the center as much as possible.  When soldering in that place - the receiver just lay down perfectly after the coup.  And the second reason is the 1.26 mm I mentioned.  At the end of the battery (where its electronics are) there is a slight thickening, and the battery itself is slightly thinner, and the phone‚Äôs electronics are on par with the battery.  Thickening is just where the antenna is desired.  So it turned out that ideally we put the soft part of the antenna for thickening, and 1.26 mm will be above the electronics, which is quite acceptable. <br><br>  Well, then - build and check.  So MIUI reports on what is charging: <br> <a href="http://piccy.info/view3/5321327/9c6ff6c9b3a1ee36be345b37b04e072f/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/353/35a/c5e/35335ac5e87f9cfb7e008e90d5e38036.jpg" alt="Piccy.info - Free Image Hosting"></a> <a href="http://i.piccy.info/a3c/2013-10-23-11-33/i8-5321327/240x160-r"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0ca/608/1c3/0ca6081c3a10b0f426bc590924d6001b.gif"></a> <br><br>  In addition to the receiver, which was built into the phone, you need a QI standard charging station.  There are many different, both cheap Chinese and expensive branded (made in the same China).  I stopped at this (it is with a built-in battery at 10A): <br> <a href="http://piccy.info/view3/5321348/0081bc21f350231d6d570c538dac5780/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/acf/086/4df/acf0864dfff717dbd6b5c6938e621b22.jpg" alt="Piccy.info - Free Image Hosting"></a> <a href="http://i.piccy.info/a3c/2013-10-23-10-58/i8-5321348/240x160-r"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0ca/608/1c3/0ca6081c3a10b0f426bc590924d6001b.gif"></a> <br>  Although the IVC for specifying the data of 10,000 mA was clearly filmed with Chinese instruments.  In fact, the capacity is different down.  But a couple of full charge is enough, and thanks for that, as they say. <br><br>  In general, I am satisfied.  Charges longer than from the lace (the receiver is limited to 500mA), but the phone usually charges at night for charging, so it‚Äôs not critical at all.  At the end of the charging process - both devices are disconnected from each other. <br>  On the other hand, if you put a station in the workplace, then you can take the phone from the station and put it on it, respectively, the energy consumption during working hours may tend to 0 if the work is not on departure.  And if the exit - then a similar station, only 12V, can be connected to the car.  And after talking, send the phone in your pocket, and on the stand. <br><br>  Everything works, the appearance is not broken.  The place, with a 1.26mm thickening, is felt, but since the screen is beneath it, and then the silumin frame does not affect the screen.  Well, we'll see ... <br><br>  Actually opening can be avoided by those who carry the phone in a non-hard case.  The space between the case and the back cover should be enough for outdoor installation of the receiver.  In addition, the external installation of the receiver reduces the heat inside the unit, which is more favorable for the battery life cycle.  But the inner is aesthetically much more pleasant. <br><br>  In general, the adaptation of almost any smartphone to the world of wireless charging technologies is not so terrible. <br><br>  PS all that you do - you do at your own peril and risk, if you are not confident in your abilities - it‚Äôs better not to start.  An illiterate opening of the device entails a possible withdrawal from the guarantee, any traces of soldering inside the device - 100% deprive you of warranty service. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/198732/">https://habr.com/ru/post/198732/</a></p>
