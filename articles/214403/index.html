  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Guaranteed Delayed Message Delivery</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello, this article is more an outline for reflection than a full-fledged article and its goal is to discuss one interesting and irrelevant topic. <br><br><h5>  Formulation of the problem </h5><br>  Send the message to the interlocutor, quickly check the delivery, guarantee readability no earlier than after a specified time, and guarantee only the read ability itself, and not the reading itself. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  Scope of application </h5><br>  Examples: <br><ol><li>  A testament for great-great-grandchildren?  - incorrect statement of the problem, if they have not yet been born, because delivery is not guaranteed. <br></li><li>  The holy copywriters who care about the audience shoot the film and simultaneously launch it a) in movie theaters, b) officially in the torrent.  In the torrent video is laid out in excellent quality, but with the possibility of opening in N months. <br></li><li>  Uncle Vasya wrote a book exposing secret materials and is not sure that after this he will be able to survive, but he wants to draw time and unleash it.  He can lay out one chapter of his book a week, and together with the first chapter lay out the entire book in open access, but with reading postponed for a couple of months, the author‚Äôs non-random death is ultimately an impetus to even more promotion of information that is no longer possible to localize intercept. <br></li><li>  Flashmob.  The all-seeing general is planning an attack on a virtual state in the virtual world [/ me winks].  Sends instructions with deferred reading to all his virtual subordinates and issues an order to read the instruction as early as possible, for example, everyone will succeed in 5 days. <br></li><li>  Fighting spam.  Mr. X is not against receiving letters from strangers, but he wants to torture spammers, then he puts an asymmetrical lock on his box and, at the first request, gives the public key with deferred reading for 10 minutes. In this case, it is assumed that this is about overloading the spammers task, not just waiting, i.e.  This is a special case of implementation. <br></li></ol><br><h5>  Implementation methods </h5><br><ol><li>  Cryptographic.  We will postpone reading the description of this method for the time of reading the next ten methods, if you still do not like goto. <br></li><li>  Astronomical.  The use of global clocks, such as the exit of the planet due to the sun  It will be possible and useful in those close times when any person will be able to discover previously unknown planets, i.e.  approximately when the number of undetected planets available for detection will be slightly less than the number of all possible 128-bit UIDs of the 21st century.  It is assumed that the necessary information for opening the data bag will be removed from the planet itself. <br></li><li>  Logistic.  Delayed postmen, bank cells.  This terribly outdated method suffers from timely delivery control. <br></li><li>  Logistic 2. We send a message to the moon, it is reflected and returned to Earth in a second.  Beautiful, but not suitable - bad, that we again can not check the delivery in advance. <br></li><li>  Biological.  If we need to transfer only a couple of bits, we can give the recipient a pack of flower seeds, and he will have to grow them until mid-summer, when he knows the color of the petals - and this will be the decisive moment.  DNA scanners can ruin this promising primeval method. <br></li><li>  Biological 2. We transmit our gene through conception and thus we identify ourselves - we can assume that this was the message. <br></li><li>  A hardware solution with an alarm clock that gives a message at a specified time. <br></li><li>  Technological.  We give the message in an unobvious form, for example, on an unmanifested film and then the recipient is forced to spend some time guaranteed to go to a photo lab. <br></li><li>  Network.  We give the encrypted message immediately, and the password will be given by crones from 10 of some stipulated servers.  It will be more beautiful if only the target recipient of our message knows about these servers, and it is better that he does not know them, but only was ready to receive email from someone. <br></li><li>  Corporatocratic.  (Idea for Eurobusiness).  In objective reality, there should be at least one intergalactic alien-protected uninterested office that will lay out a trillion public keys for encryption for the next million years, and public decryption keys will be published publicly one per second for that million years.  At the children's level, it is realizable as two fingers, but for some reason I have never heard of such laboratories before. <br></li><li>  Composite.  Well, yes, where to the engineer without such an obvious advanced proposal ... <br></li></ol><br>  Additionally.  If you need to protect yourself from the inquisitorial brute force, you need to provide a way to replace the message, for example, if we are talking about hiding the decryption key for a couple of months, then it would not be bad if opening a message with a fake key would result in deciphering something digestible - like on the truth. <br><br>  And now to the first method (see method 1) - cryptographic methods.  The bottom line: we encrypt so that no one can quickly decrypt it.  Here we will talk about algorithms that can not be parallelized.  I want to give ground for thinking about developing such methods.  Here are examples of consecutive non-paralleling (hopefully) decryption functions: <br><ol><li>  Like the Fibonnachi series, only backwards (obverfibonachevsky-my method). <br></li><li>  Calculate the inverse function for f (f (f (... f (message) ..))) <br></li></ol><br>  <b>Fibonnachi series</b> <br>  It is defined as x <sub>n</sub> = x <sub>n-1</sub> + x <sub>n-2</sub> , respectively, we can calculate x <sub>n-2</sub> = x <sub>n</sub> - x <sub>n-1</sub> to the end, where x <sub>0</sub> = x <sub>2</sub> - x <sub>1</sub> . <br>  Then, when performing calculations, we need to constantly store only two operands.  Of course, this is not about an arithmetic sum, but about a reversible binary operator.

      <b>Inverse function</b> to f (f (... f (message) ...)) <br>  Encryption Algorithm: <br><ol><li>  Take the original message of any length or just a password. <br></li><li>  We generate a key for, for example, symmetric encryption. <br></li><li>  Encrypt the message (password) with the key and add the key to the encrypted message (concatenation). <br></li><li>  (1-3) We generate a new similar key, encrypt and concatenate.  We repeat it many times. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7ea/1f0/dd6/7ea1f0dd6d534dc6c92bd2eeb2630ef1.png"><br></li></ol><br>  The decryption algorithm is obvious - at each iteration of decryption we see the next necessary key. <br><br>  I assume that the transition to partial decryption of intermediate values ‚Äã‚Äãwill not allow you to read the beginning of the message, but, in general, you can use the appropriate required encryption mode for security.  Also, for the sake of humor, you can initially lengthen the original message garbage.  For symmetric encryption, the encryption time will be commensurate with the decryption time, which, for example, does not bother me, for example, if I am the owner of a modern processor, which is faster to find. <br><br>  Cryptographic error. <br>  The explanations show that the recovery time depends on the processor architecture and its clock frequency.  To avoid this, you can objectively stamp fast processors to calculate this single single function, then each person will have the fastest processor for a negligible price.  Of course, for strategic purposes such consumer goods may not be suitable, but then you can think a bit and use the composite method (see method 11). <br><br>  <i>See also method 10. The topic of cryptographic services, if you think about them, gives a number of business ideas and network protocols, which have not yet seen the light.</i>  <i>So far, implemented in practice, I know only certification, but, for sure, I just know very little;</i>  <i>and storing rainbow tables is, in my opinion, not a very healthy topic, although it is modern.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/214403/">https://habr.com/ru/post/214403/</a></p>
