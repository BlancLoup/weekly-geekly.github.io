Not an exception and the area of ‚Äã‚Äãfront-end development - there are also outstanding personalities.  Their opinions are listened to, they are followed in blogs and social networks and their books are read.  In the course of their work, they give rise to various original solutions or techniques that instantly diverge around the world of web development and remain relevant for more than one year.  They create convenient <a href="http://lea.verou.me/css3-tools/">online services for layout</a> , write <a href="http://www.modernizr.com/">useful js-libraries</a> , <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/">improve browsers</a> , promote web standards and have a direct impact on their development.  They can call themselves <a href="http://jonchretien.com/">front end engineer</a> , <a href="http://jakearchibald.com/">web developer</a> , <a href="https://plus.google.com/101987072260327250694/about">web designer</a> , <a href="https://plus.google.com/101987072260327250694/about">web designer</a> , <a href="http://simurai.com/about">UI Designer</a> , <a href="http://www.quirksmode.org/about/">browser compatibility expert,</a> or just <a href="http://www.ryanseddon.com/">css lover</a> , but for most of us they are the <strong>stars of the world front end</strong> who make the Internet the way we know him  On Habr√©, quite often there are reviews of interesting solutions, techniques and news from the world of web development, with indication of Western authors, but not everyone knows anything about them except the name.  I wanted to briefly tell the general public about some of these comrades. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/fe7/034/5aa/fe70345aac118f02efe3710a1b203bbc.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h3>  Eric A.

The Greek Michaelia Komvouti-Verou, known under the shorter name Lea Verou, is a rather new, but already quite sensational person in the world of front-end.  In 2011, she became a finalist in the ‚ÄúBrilliant newcomer‚Äù category of the .net Awards 2011, and in the same year her <a href="http://vimeo.com/31719130">CSS3 Secrets talk</a> was marked as <a href="http://www.netmagazine.com/features/2011-review-15-web-conference-talks-you-need-watch">.net magazine's 15 best talks of 2011</a> .

It is difficult to name areas on the web to which he did not lay his hand.  In 1998, he founded <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/">A List Apart</a> , an online magazine for people who make websites, which is very popular in the world of web design and front-end development.  That same year, he and his friends created <a href="http://www.webstandards.org/">The Web Standards Project,</a> an alliance of web developers who fought for the adoption of web standards.  They were able to influence Microsoft and Netscape to support W3C technologies and standards, thereby ending the ‚ÄúBrowser War‚Äù.  His book <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Designing_with_Web_Standards">Designing with Web Standards</a> became a bestseller and was translated into 13 languages.  In 2001, from his website A List Apart, he called on all the front-end world to abandon the old layout techniques and go on to create semantic code and actively use CSS.  Now Geoffrey is often invited to various jury, conferences, and institutes to give lectures to students. <br><br><h3>  Dan Cederholm </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/97d/799/796/97d7997966dab6a077b1f59128e001b2.jpg"><br>  Personal website: <a href="http://simplebits.com/">simplebits.com</a> <br>  For me, Dan‚Äôs personality stands apart - his book ‚ÄúBulletproof Web Design‚Äù was the first book about web design that I read, and it was she who inspired me to love the front end and everything connected with it.  If it were not for Sederholm, perhaps now I would be a mediocre php coder, but it seemed to work out :) In addition to writing books, he is the founder of the web studio Simplebits and the author of the <a href="http://simplebits.com/">blog of the</a> same name.  As a recognized expert in web design, he worked with YouTube, Microsoft, Google, MTV, ESPN, Electronic Arts, Blogger, Fast Company, Inc.  Magazine and many other companies.  In 2012, he had already received the <a href="http://techfellows.com/product-design-marketing/2011/">TechFellow award</a> in the nomination of Product Design &amp; Marketing. <br><br><h3>  Peter-Paul Koch (Peter-Paul Koch aka PPK) </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d0d/167/bfb/d0d167bfbeffedc3a38561b62488bcdf.jpg"><br>  Personal website: <a href="http://quirksmode.org/">quirksmode.org</a> <br>  Peter's university education, also known as ppk, had no prerequisites for becoming a landmark figure in the world of the frontend ‚Äî he studied Ancient History at the University of Amsterdam and was more versed in the history of the Roman Empire than in HTML.  Nevertheless, he started his professional activity on the web in 1998.  After working for several months, he concluded that at that time there was no site that would provide accurate and correct information about browser compatibility.  Therefore, in the same year, he decided to create it himself and start testing browsers.  This project has grown into <a href="http://quirksmode.org/">QuirksMode.org</a> , which was launched in 2003.  After that, he developed a vigorous activity in the field of client development, and in 2007 he created the organization <a href="http://fronteers.nl/about">‚ÄúFronteers‚Äù</a> (frontend engineers), which initially included Dutch web developers and which currently includes more than four hundred participants.  Members of this organization hold various meetings, including the conference of the same name, which has been held annually since 2009.  For those who want to familiarize themselves with the topics of reports and the level of participants, one can always find its videos on the Internet, for example on <a href="http://vimeo.com/fronteers/videos">Vimeo</a> .  In 2009, PPK stopped developing for standard desktop browsers and moved completely into the world of <a href="http://quirksmode.org/mobile/">mobile web</a> .  As for his public activities, it is not limited to his site and Fronteers.  His <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view%3Fid%3D17147">LinkedIn profile</a> indicates that he is a freelance front-end consultant.  He probably does it well, because companies like Vodafone, Microsoft, Opera, Google and Yahoo! took advantage of his advice.  :) Also, he writes articles on popular resources, such as <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/authors/k/peterpaulkoch/">A List Apart</a> and <a href="http://www.digital-web.com/about/contributors/peterpaul_koch/">Digital Web Magazine</a> , travels <a href="http://lanyrd.com/profile/ppk/">around the world</a> with <a href="http://www.yuiblog.com/blog/2009/04/27/video-ppk-jsevents/">reports</a> and stuff like that.  Well, where do without your book.  Peter has the experience of writing - his book <a href="http://quirksmode.org/book/">ppk on JavaScript</a> . <br><br><br><h3>  Afterword </h3><br>  This is not all of those who deserve to be called stars.  In this article, I tried to acquaint you with some of those who have influenced specifically on the formation of me as a professional.  For someone else, it may be completely different people, and you can also share information about them in the comments, and I will add them to the post. <br>  If this topic is of interest to the community, I will continue to post similar posts, the benefit is enough talents that are not popular enough in runet. <br>  For the same reason, I didn‚Äôt start an article about web development monsters from the CIS - many understand what it‚Äôs about and there‚Äôs no point in representing these people.  Moreover, they can always introduce themselves here;) <br><br>  <b>PS:</b> If all the links mentioned in this article are purple in your browser - I have good news for you :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/140831/">https://habr.com/ru/post/140831/</a></p>
