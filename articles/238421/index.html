  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Intel introduced a new family of server chips</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Recently, another Intel creation was presented - the Xeon E5-2600 v3 chipset family.  According to the company-developer, new chips - the way to improve the "obsolete" data centers.  According to Diane Bryant, Senior Vice President and General Manager of Intel Data Center Group, Xeon E5-2600 v3 chips are the fastest server chips ever created by the company. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fe0/a05/c53/fe0a05c5387c42f1817ed80da431db63.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  These chips are based on Haswell microarchitecture.  The production uses a 22-nanometer technology with tri-gate bulk transistors.  The architecture provides up to 18 cores with a maximum frequency of up to 3.7GHz and a 3rd level cache up to 45 MB.  Also in the new family made a significant update - added support for DDR4 RAM.  DDR4 memory provides a 40 percent increase in bandwidth, while at the same time reducing power consumption by 35 percent.  New correction algorithms provide higher reliability in data processing, which reduces the number of errors compared to DDR3. <br><br>  There is also built-in support for the NVMe protocol, thanks to which SSDs can be placed in faster PCI-Express slots.  Servers equipped with such chips will support solid-state drives (SSD) up to 2TB.  It also simplifies the management and cooling of servers.  According to the manufacturer, Intel Xeon E5-2600 v3 processors have the world's best energy efficiency indicators (performance per unit of energy consumption).

In addition, the Intel Advanced Encryption Standard New Instructions (Intel AES-NI) command set has been improved, which has made it possible to speed up encryption and decryption operations. <br><br>  The capacity of the new chips is increased, which reduces the latency by about half.  Grantley (codename for the Xeon E5-2600 v3 family of microcircuits), among other things, supports 40 Gbps Ethernet.  The novelty will replace the Xeon E5-2600 v2 chip with the code name Romley, which in the new financial quarter accounted for more than 80 percent of all server chips supplied by Intel.  Hewlett-Packard, Dell, Lenovo, IBM, Huawei and other companies have already announced the release of servers based on new Intel chips. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0bf/f13/bef/0bff13bef6714ec5aac7194c37f411cb.jpg"><br><br>  Speaking about the new microcircuits, it is advisable to note that Intel did what is simply good in its own way, but positions it as the best.  The most significant technological change is the addition of cores and support for DDR4 memory.  Everything else was built around this. <br><br>  For illustration, you can make out an excerpt from the release: ‚Äúup to 18 cores with a maximum frequency of up to 3.7GHz and a 3rd level cache up to 45 MB‚Äù.  Particular attention is worthy of the word ‚Äúbefore‚Äù, since in the presented <a href="http://ark.intel.com/products/series/81065/Intel-Xeon-Processor-E5-2600-v3-Product-Family">price list</a> such a number of cores and cache memory is represented in a single chip - Intel Xeon Processor E5-2699 v3, which was announced but not available to order, and the declared frequency 3.7GHz is nowhere else in current price does not appear.  The maximum available for ordering at the moment is 14 cores, which is no longer bad.  We hope that this is due to the debugging processes of the new chips, and all the announced features will eventually become available to a wide range of consumers, but the marketing marketing share remains light. <br><br>  I am very pleased that progress does not stand still, and companies are improving their development, but this progress is more like a marketing game in order to get more profit.  Instead of the long-awaited release into the masses of a family of microcircuits based on 14nm technology, which is postponed, the company is increasingly issuing ‚Äúwarming up‚Äù press releases and modifying old products with a file, adding small buns and serious margins.  And we have to wait for a true technological breakthrough and be content with what we have. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/238421/">https://habr.com/ru/post/238421/</a></p>
