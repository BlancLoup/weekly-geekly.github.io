  <section class="page js-page"><h1>New process of launching online games in China</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Recently, the process of launching online games in the PRC has become quite complicated.  In this article, I will step through the whole process "from and to". <br><br>  I will immediately say - since we are completely white and fluffy, we are trying to fully comply with all requirements.  Having connections, contacts, and ‚ÄúGuangxi‚Äù, some points can be skipped. <br><br>  <i>PS: All images of documents are found on the Internet and are used solely for the sake of clarity.</i> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So, initially you need an LLC in the PRC with a registered capital of at least 1 million yuan with 51% of capital of Chinese origin.  But this is the simplest and most understandable moment, we will skip it, especially since it has nothing to do with IT.  Assume that the legal entity has a freshly printed license for the right to engage in business activities in your hands.

    <div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ur/u1/tf/uru1tfwvutfyk--nmfywfbrf0xw.png" width="500"></div><br>  The next step, which is mandatory for any developer, is registration of a license for classes related to the extraction of added value in the telecommunications sector (Áîµ‰ø° Â¢ûÂÄº ‰∏öÂä° ËÆ∏ÂèØËØÅ).  It is with the design of this license that the requirements for the legal entity are connected.  The process of registration takes 1-2 months, and during this time, officials from the Ministry of Industry and Information (Â∑•‰∏ö ‰ø°ÊÅØ Âåñ) took your whole soul out of you.  At the same time, a domain is added to this license, which then becomes associated with your company and the license, and when you purchase a CDN, host, or purchase advertising traffic, you will need this license.  Essentially, the main document. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ih/ik/yh/ihikyhstoeadcp2fpfo1l7gskgg.png" width="500"></div><br>  After registration of the ICP (Internet Content Provider) license, you need to prepare the product for inspection by officials of the Ministry of Industry and Information.  For this you need to meet a variety of requirements.  If about many of the requirements of the category ‚Äúnot to contain information aimed at overthrowing the current system‚Äù everything is clear, then I will dwell on unclear points. <br><br>  1) user verification.  Firstly, in order to ensure that anonymous use of Internet services in China is, in fact, prohibited, secondly, to determine its age (age limits are associated with playing time ‚Äî minors are allowed to play fully up to 3 hours a day, from 3 up to 5 hours, he will be able to receive 50% of awards per game, more than 5 hours - 0% of awards).  Well, the topic of restrictions for minors is a topic for a separate large article, the main thing now is that we must implement identity verification BEFORE entering the game. <br><br>  For this, we have 2 APIs connected.  The first is checking the user ID number.  To do this, before entering the game, he must enter his full name and ID-card number, then through apistore.cn (excellent service, I recommend, but there are many such intermediaries), reconciliation takes place, and if apistore returns ‚ÄúOK‚Äù, we check age (any ID-card number includes date of birth - it will always be in the format XXXXXX19860817XXXXXX) and based on this we include restrictions.  Joke, we have very lazy developers and they chose not to let anyone who was under 18 enter the game.  The second API is verification using the ‚Äúphone number + name‚Äù.  Even in the largest package, each check costs about 4 cents.  That is, any attracted user will cost you at least 4 cents, which significantly increases the cost of marketing and attracting users. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vm/ex/c6/vmexc6xxfxfegflb4trjoqagxc4.png" width="500"></div><br>  2) implementation of block lists and filtering of obscene content.  In fact, everything is anti-Party, anti-Chinese, pro-Tibetan, pro-Taiwanese, etc.  etc., all sorts of ‚Äújasmine revolutions‚Äù in chat, nicknames, avatars should either be blocked or replaced with asterisks.  But since the creation of such a system from scratch is an extremely heavy task, we follow easier paths: <br><br>  a) smart way A. Transfer the filtering to the third side.  Fortunately, Wechat, Weibo and other major social services have such a system, constantly update it, and all we need is to prohibit editing of nicknames and avatars and pull them up via OAuth when authorizing through third-party services.  According to this scheme, most games work - the option to create your own account is available in few places, everywhere - only login through third-party services <br><br>  b) smart way B. Create a predefined list of presets for chat.  That is, the user cannot type the text himself.  He can only choose from the available options.  The same applies to avatars - only the choice of pre-installed. <br><br>  3) checking the game for the absence of a nude or half-naked person (for example, 91 requires ‚Äúcovering the body parts below the neck and above the knee with clothes), the absence of rudeness, mate, obscene language, etc.  etc. <br><br>  Well, the product is ready, and now you need to copyright on it (ËÆ°ÁÆóÊú∫ ËΩØ‰ª∂ Ëëó‰ΩúÊùÉ ÁôªËÆ∞ ËØÅ‰π¶).  Pay attention to the fact that the object of copyright is the source code of the application, that is, when copyright registration, in addition to regular documents, you will need to provide 30 initial and 30 last pages of the source code of the application). <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pd/6-/ma/pd6-ma5vsvodn5x99tp1vlaoprm.png" width="500"></div><br>  After copyrights are issued, you can proceed to the last step - GPN registration - Game Publishing Number.  It is this document that confirms that your game has passed validation and is legal and legal.  Without this number, you will not be able to publish it in any Android store, as well as in iTunes Connect, put a tick in front of China. <br><br>  For its design, you will need all the above documents, a playable version of the game with accounts, on which everything is unlocked and everything is available, the source code of the application, as well as when making copyrights.  List of in-game currency with the exchange rate for real yuan.  The chance that random purchases (like buying Hearthstone boosters, which contain cards of varying value) will be one way or another.  Full description of the game with a description of the main controls and functionality.  Media with a copy of the game or a link to download it.  The presence of records "will soon open" or "will soon be available" in the game is unacceptable.  Naturally, with a major update of the game (which affects at least 30% of the code), it will have to be redone.  It takes about a month. <br><br>  Well, after all this, you will receive a letter from the Office of Publishing and News, in which they will say that there are no comments, and the game called such and such is given such a number.  Voila, the process is complete, you can publish the game and collect your income.  Unless, of course, you can cope with the API integration of various Android stores, study the rules for issuing virtual currency in applications, make CDN and hosting in China, and so on and so forth and so on without end. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/346932/">https://habr.com/ru/post/346932/</a></p>
