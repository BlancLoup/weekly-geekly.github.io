  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Business. Different. New areas.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Climb here in my head different thoughts.  Where does what come from and why does one manage the airline and the other sells shawarma?  What is the basis of business?  Superidea?  Practical consumer need for something?  Something about which they do not know, but will tear off with hands if to show? <br>  In general, I set out a general idea.  On the example of transport and transport systems. <a name="habracut"></a><br>  There is such a convenient form of transport - the plane.  Fast, convenient, but it has one drawback - the airports are far from each other and to get to a certain point, you still need to go by high-speed train, subway - the transport is not so fast, the distance is less, but it delivers us closer to our goal.  But still not straight to her.  There is also a bus, trolley buses, trams, minibuses, taxis - each has its own pros and cons.  It can be said that not everything ends at them either - there is also an elevator in the building - also a transport.  The problem is that each of them functions separately - according to its schedule, with its own rules, with its own characteristics, and this is a huge minus. <br>  In order to get from Deglava street, house 3 in Riga, to Makarova street, house 4 in Moscow, you need to make a long journey on at least 4 types of transport - rates, connection of schedules, etc., etc. <br>  But!  You can use the services of a special agency and forget about organizing your trip - you will pay for a single service - you will receive a pile of tickets and checks for all trains, airplanes, taxis and go!  Here I want to dwell on this.  This is a very interesting business.  The business of collecting and processing information, presenting it to the client in a way understandable to him.  And it works in all areas.  As I said before - this is the bread of travel agencies and travel agencies. <br>  Interesting examples are common: ION.  They sell phones by many, but they still answer any customer questions, help customize purchased products, train users.  It turns out not distribution of plane tickets - ‚ÄúHere's a communicator for 40,000 rubles.  Next! ‚Äù, But a complete chain.  Poyuzal, any questions - come, we will answer.  ICQ you set up?  - come.  You want to learn yourself - welcome.  The client no longer needs to think, search, try by trial and error - they will solve any problem in ION - super! <br>  Apple is valuable for its unified system: hardware - software - online store - player. <br>  Now closer to the Internet.  Search.  Google, Yandex and others.  By my classification, these are airplanes.  They get about there where necessary, but how to get exactly you need to know.  The language of search queries - how many users know at least "-" or "OR"?  Very little.  And more complex situations: who knows, for example, about the possibility of receiving notifications about new results of a query via RSS, by email, sms? <br>  And this is despite the fact that the basis of many types of business is the search for information on the Internet.  Personnel agencies (search for resumes), trade (search for tenders), real estate (review of offers) - every day managers come to work and monotonously check the same sites, checking whether new resumes, tenders, or offers have appeared.  There are even special people whose duties include monitoring sites, manual selection of information and sending it to the manager.  Of course, there are some kind of curves for the atovmatic scanning of Internet sites, but: <br>  They need to understand, and this is an ordinary manager lazy, that in general is true - everyone should do their work. <br>  They will not give the exact expected results, since they are more flexible in something than the major search engines, but they are also buses.  They will not take you directly to the apartment. <br>  I see personal search systems that search / parse for specific pages, automatically filter information using once-configured filters, provide only the necessary data, in the right format for the customer: in the form of RSS, by email, sms. <br>  I had to communicate with representatives of some companies, their interest is high, because it allows saving on content-filtering workers, moreover, such a system works more precisely and faster than a person.  At the moment, several such systems have been successfully developed and implemented in the work of large companies. <br>  I wanted to share this vision and experience in creating new services.  No need for brilliant and innovative ideas.  Just look at how you can optimize the workflow of people, improve the world around them and collect them a new service from the existing bricks.  It is interesting to hear your opinion, comments, comments. </div>
