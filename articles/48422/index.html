No wonder that many have already been discussed, although they could have just occurred to us.  Therefore, letters and pleas to the developers were postponed until the forum was read.  And, as it turned out, not in vain ... <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>What I wanted to get, with the continuation:</b> 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"

      1. the <strong>ability to have different profiles in the scheduler</strong> (you need this in order to differentiate the speed by hours / time of day; for example, do not stop all downloads to work, adjust the speed in the evening, not clogging the channel) - it turned out that it was already discussed, one of the planned improvements in version 1.9; <br><br>  2. <strong>sorting labels</strong> (reverse sorting or disconnecting) - there is already a direct sorting alphabetically (AZ), another is not planned to enter.  All the desired sorting is proposed to be carried out not with the help of tags, but in the next window; <br><br>  3. <strong>multi-tags</strong> (the ability to specify multiple tags for a single torrent; or tree-like tags of the form: category-&gt; subcategory) - apparently will not be entered.  However, a solution with restoring order does exist.  Use special characters.  For example, you can use this |  or&gt;.  However, it should be borne in mind that auto-creation of folders with names similar to labels will not work.  Since the command mkdir distinguishes not all characters.  A great way was suggested by <a href="http://sdvn.habrahabr.ru/">sdvn</a> - use category / subcategory type labels (output we get a disk: \\ finished \ category \ subcategory). <br><br>  4. <strong>Sorting RSS torrent feeds</strong> - already requested, the same applies to the filter selector (Drag and Drop is now working; inconvenient for large numbers, but it works); <br><br>  5. Marker <strong>Editor</strong> (for changing existing and creating new ones with changing directory name) - rejected in one of the topics.  It was said about the following: ‚ÄúPatsaki, why are you?  It's just easy to do, select all the files and assign a new label. ‚Äù <br><br>  6. I <strong>looked / didn‚Äôt look in front of the file with subsequent automatic deletion</strong> - there are actually two improvements: interface and auto-delete.  In the first case, the introduction of a new column, if you think about it, is not entirely rational.  If the torrents are few, then mention yourself.  And if a lot, then more and more will have to suffer with the touch of a button.  Sometimes there is simply no need to fuss.  But with automatic removal, everything is much more interesting.  The option has been proposed and partially approved.  That is, there will be an extension to the scheduler, but there will be no auto deletion of torrents and files.  How it will look, and whether it will appear in version 1.9 is not yet clear; <br><br>  7. <strong>icq-bot for remote control</strong> - everything is completely sluggish here.  A certain Russian-speaking comrade appeared and offered his work on Delphi.  Unfortunately, without attaching the source code or any intelligible description.  They reacted to it with suspicion and deleted the link to the development.  It was not possible to contact him.  In theory, implementations are possible, since the API is open. <br><br>  8. <strong>Automatic processing of files upon completion of the download</strong> (options: unpacking archives, video processing) - can not be done only by means of a torrent client.  You can manually connect the execution of certain actions for the torrent or group (properties -&gt; advanced -&gt; run this program when download finishes).  You can automate the process with third-party solutions (bat-file, nncron, etc.); <br><br>  Perhaps there is something that you do not have enough in utorrent?  What improvements would you like to see? <br><br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/48422/">https://habr.com/ru/post/48422/</a></p>
