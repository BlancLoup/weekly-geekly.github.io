  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Last year in ITMO or writing a diploma at the Faculty of IT & P</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Greetings to the habrasoobschestvo! <br>  At the beginning of last summer, when it came time to think about writing a diploma, I rustled the whole runet on the subtleties and features of this process, not just in our department, but at least in my faculty.  Nothing found. <br>  The usual way for most universes to transmit this information is from their older comrades to the younger ones and further between the younger ones.  In the case of our flow, the horizontal and vertical connections were broken so much that the majority worked ‚Äúblindly‚Äù. <br><br>  Having gone through this path to the end, I would like to ease it to those who follow and tell in detail how it was with us in the specialty Information Systems and Technologies (230201) of the Department of Information Technology at the Faculty of IT and SP of ITU. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Foreword </h4><br>  For a start, I would like to note that the described howto may be completely inapplicable to other specialties, departments and faculties, so you should not take it written as the ultimate truth. <br><br>  The entire presentation will be divided into 7 periods - 5 months allotted for a diploma, as well as the time before and after them.  In my specialty training lasts for five and a half years, therefore half a year the diploma falls on the fall semester and begins in September.  If the diploma fell on the spring semester - just replace September with January, the rest of the chronology will continue.

      For each period, I will summarize what should be at its end, as well as links to useful documents.  I will give some documents already filled out for my diploma - this will help understanding the material. <br>  Everything stated is important for specialists (software engineer).  Bachelors and masters have slightly different job requirements and deadlines. <br><br><h5>  Abbreviations used </h5><br>  IS - information system <br>  BP is a business process <br>  DB - database <br>  SAC - State Certification Commission <br>  WRC - final qualifying work <br>  PZ - explanatory note <br>  BC - life safety <br><br><h4>  1. Before graduation </h4><br>  The most interesting question of this period is ‚Äú <i>when to start thinking about a diploma?</i>  ".  There is no unequivocal answer to it, but in my time it‚Äôs time comes at 4-5m courses.  On these courses there are subjects that God himself ordered to bind to the future diploma.  Basically this is a different design of IP / BP / DB.  Binding practices in these subjects to a future diploma significantly reduces the amount of work remaining, since this is almost the entire second chapter (design). <br><br>  The main thing that needs to be understood is to develop a really interesting and necessary IP (and this is exactly what is required of us according to GOST) for the allotted six months is unrealistic, simply because of the large amount of paperwork.  There is little time left for encoding, and if you combine study with work, you have to optimize something =) Therefore, it is better to code in the summer, the result will be better and it will be easier in the future. <br><br>  <b>As a result</b> (by the beginning of the 6th course) it is necessary: <br>  <b><i>Minimum</i></b> <ul><li>  identify the area in which your diploma subject will be; </li><li>  Represent what automation object this can be tied to. </li></ul>  <b><i>Maximum</i></b> <ul><li>  identify the specific topic of the diploma and discuss it with several teachers from its department; </li><li>  compile a list of teachers whom I would like to take as a teacher; </li><li>  be able to briefly answer the question ‚Äúwhat is it and why is it needed?‚Äù; </li><li>  have on hand a fully-designed IP (system / software architecture, data architecture); </li><li>  program code for future development. </li></ul><br><br><h4>  2. September </h4><br>  During this month, it will be necessary to decide on the topic (if this has not yet been done), to decide on a textbook, write an annotation and submit an application for approval of all this to the SAC secretary.  It is also desirable by the end of the month to make an approximate plan of the content of the PZ with the university. <br><br><h5>  Theme </h5>  I was always surprised that many students, having studied for 5 years in the IT specialty, did not find an interesting area for themselves.  And yet, the subject area that is interesting to you personally is an inexhaustible source of topics for a thesis.  Personally, I had to choose from 3 previously compiled reviews of various small projects, and during the writing of the diploma 5 more research topics were formed. <br>  The topic should satisfy GOST for your specialty (they can be found on the department website).  In our case, the requirements for it can be reduced to developing software to automate any business process.  As practice has shown, almost everything can be adjusted to this definition.  Develop a calculator for Vasya?  This is the same information system to support the process of calculating salaries for individual entrepreneurs Vasily Pupkin!  However, the closer the chosen topic to real life - the easier it will be to protect it. <br><br>  If the topic is completely abstract and poorly applicable in practice, it will be wrapped up when approved.  If it is too big - you risk not having time to do everything that you promised. <br><br>  As a rule, the theme sounds ‚Äúmore‚Äù than the work itself (remember the example with a calculator), but this does not mean that the work should be too simple and trivial.  To formulate a topic so that it fits all these requirements, you should be helped by the chosen scientific adviser. <br><br><h5>  supervisor </h5>  The task of the supervisor is to direct your research to the desired area, correct the wording, assist in organizational matters, and so on.  In general, an indispensable person, so you need to choose thoroughly. <br><br>  Once you have a fairly narrow direction for work, write a small review and go with him to those teachers who you think will be useful.  You tell them the very essence of the work, answer the questions, give out your own variants of the title of the topic of this work and invite the teacher to take you back. <br>  It is best to do this at the very beginning of September, while most students are still resting.  This will leave the breadth of the teachers' choice (since there is an unofficial (or public?) Limit on the number of students for one academic) and will give a temporary odds in formulating the topic together with it. <br><br>  It should be prepared for the fact that some teachers have their own preferences in areas of knowledge and do not take topics beyond them. <br><br>  The supervisor does not have to be from the university, it can also be a person from the company for which you are developing your diploma.  However, in the case of a university supervisor, it will be easier for you, because from year to year he watches over the defenses and knows many subtleties unknown to outside people. <br><br><h5>  Organizational meeting </h5>  By the end of September, an organizational meeting of the stream is held, where you will finally be told the requirements for the WRC, how to approve the topic, who can be picked up, a tentative schedule, etc.  After the meeting, they will give a little more than a week to find a teacher and approve his topic.  At this moment, the students who have hitherto slept begin to run around the square-eyed university asking for a topic for work. <br><br>  For the approval of the topic, you will need to write a <a href="https://docs.google.com/open%3Fid%3D0B9eXus9GJme9OGMyZTI3N2UtYjczYS00ZjJhLThhZjctOTdjYjE2MjZlMzFm">statement</a> and annotation by hand.  Annotation, in this case, is a brief (no more than A4 page of printed text) review of the project.  Based on this document, the department will decide whether to approve your topic or not, so it is necessary to clearly indicate the relevance and applicability of your work in the real world - as practice shows, this is the most winning option. <br>  The choice will offer 3 options for the final work: <ol><li>  Development </li><li>  Design </li><li>  Together </li></ol>  <i><b>Development</b></i> - an option for those who nauchuk suggested to develop something already designed.  It is understood that you need only nakodit yes debug.  As a rule, in this case, you have been working with this teacher in any direction for a long time and all this howto you know by heart =) I did not hear about these guys on our stream. <br><br>  <i><b>Designing</b></i> is an option for those who do not know how to program well, not at all, but they still want to pass.  Usually such topics are given by teachers and are poorly close to real life. <br><br>  <i><b>All together</b></i> - the most appropriate option for those who know how to design and program (corresponding to their specialty).  It implies a full cycle of software development work - they chose a topic, analyzed a subject area, designed, developed, tested, implemented.  This option is most beneficial because no one especially looks at the code, and much less is already looked at design, because it is only part of your work. <br><br>  When submitting all the papers (application and annotation), you must indicate the selected option. <br><br><h5>  Results </h5><ul><li>  Nachruk selected and subject </li><li>  Filled abstract </li><li>  Documents handed over to the Secretary of the SJC </li><li>  A plan for the future PP </li></ul>  <i><b>Related Documents</b></i> <br><br>  <a href="https://docs.google.com/open%3Fid%3D0B9eXus9GJme9OTI4MzFmZDAtZmIxYS00ZmY5LTlhNjctMjg1MDk4MzY5YWFm">List of recommended scientific advisers</a> ; <br>  <a href="https://docs.google.com/open%3Fid%3D0B9eXus9GJme9YmJiNmUyZmItMjFhNC00N2Y0LTlhMmQtNjA1MjQ4ZWE4N2Zi">Approved topics of our stream</a> ; <br>  <a href="https://docs.google.com/open%3Fid%3D0B9eXus9GJme9NWZhNWQzMGMtYzQwOC00YzkzLWJhZDEtZjI5NWJkNDBkZDk3">An example of the annotation of my thesis</a> . <br><br><h4>  3. October </h4><br>  During this month (in our case, on the 20th day) a department meeting will be held, where topics of diplomas are approved.  Do not approve 50%, posting comments and clarifications.  If you are unlucky, run to Uchelku and reformulate the topic with it, rewrite the annotation and submit the documents again. <br><br>  Sessions on the approval of those dragged down to the very pre-defense (late November) and it is very important that all these alterations of topics and annotations do not strongly influence the essence of the work, because in parallel with this process you need to write an explanatory note (PZ) and finish the program. <br><br>  PP is usually divided into 5 chapters: <ol><li>  Domain Overview </li><li>  Design </li><li>  Development and debugging </li><li>  Economy </li><li>  BC </li></ol><br>  This plan is suitable for the ‚Äúall together‚Äù option (see the month of September).  In the case of the ‚Äúdesign‚Äù option, the second chapter is stretched to the third. <br><br>  General advice for this period is to complete the first and second chapters.  The first chapter is the most universal and may require alterations only if your subject is rejected so that even the area of ‚Äã‚Äãwork will change.  The second chapter is less flexible, but mainly consists of diagrams of various levels of the development architecture, so it can be relatively quickly redone to meet new requirements.  The hint obtained when associating a diploma to training at 4-5 courses (see the period before the diploma) will have a strong effect - chapter 2 is already on hand and it only remains to work with a file. <br><br><h5>  Results </h5><ul><li>  Written 1st chapter </li><li>  2nd chapter outline </li><li>  Compiled a detailed plan of the third chapter. </li></ul>  <i><b>Related Documents</b></i> <br>  <a href="https://docs.google.com/open%3Fid%3D0B9eXus9GJme9NjYzMzYxZmQtNjFiYy00Mzk4LWI3MGUtZjMwNjY1YjJjNjNl">My plan PZ</a> <br><br><h4>  4. November </h4><br>  At the end of this month, the first pre-defense takes place and all activities should be directed to ensure that you have as much as possible at the beginning (ideally, all 3 chapters). <br><br>  If the topic is not yet approved - the last chance to do it before the start of the pre-defense, however, there were cases that even with an unconfirmed topic, students were allowed to pre-defense, provided that the PP is almost completely finished.  In this case, it is implied that you yourself will prove that your topic is worth a diploma. <br><br>  If you follow the plan, then it's time to finish the 2nd chapter and start the 3rd.  If the program (the goal of the work is a finished software product) is not ready for pre-protection - that's okay.  Now, if the 1-2 chapters are empty - you can earn a poorly, and, as a result, a bias against the second pre-protection. <br><br><h5>  Pre-defense number 1 </h5><br>  Officially, the defense should be one, but you will have two, or even three.  Thus, the department is insured against a large number of obscene works on defense (after all, no one needs to spoil the statistics of graduation) by kicking and sifting out students in advance. <br><br>  At this event, check the composition of the work, look at the presence of mandatory items (specific solutions, relevance, review of analogues, etc.) and put one of two assessments - not satisfied or satisfied.  This assessment is made up of the presence and composition of the first three chapters - for each chapter they put a plus or a minus. <br><br>  Both of our pre-defense meetings took place in the second half of the day (3-5 hours after noon) in the audience 144 and stretched for 5 days (about 60 people on the stream).  At first, all those gathered pour the presentation onto a computer, then they are launched one by one to defend themselves. <br><br>  The commission is a hodgepodge of familiar teachers.  You will need to speak in front of her, show a presentation revealing the essence of your work and demonstrate the results of your work (if you are ready).  For everything about everything takes 7-10 minutes, so do not tighten, they can interrupt in half a word. <br><br>  During the speech, the commission will flip through your PZ, so do not be lazy to spend time on its design in accordance with GOST 7.32-2001.  They also look at the volume of the text - without appendices at least 75 pages.  Do not expect to "finish off" the pages with the help of the fourth and fifth chapters, there are no more than 15 pages. <br><br>  After that, you will be asked questions, sometimes very poorly related to your work.  It is important not to be ashamed and, when necessary, to answer that this question has nothing to do with your work (and justify why).  Otherwise there is a risk of suffering from excessive zeal of individual members of the commission. <br><br>  After all the questions in detail tell about the comments and how to fix them.  This is a very useful feedback, because no one will direct you to the second pre-defense, but simply will not be allowed to protect.  That is why try to present as much as possible to the first preliminary defense - this will reduce the risks to the second. <br><br>  If you still get a bad one, it's okay, but this is a loud signal that you need to prepare much more thoroughly than your comrades for the second pre-defense. <br><br><h5>  Results </h5><ul><li>  Approved topic </li><li>  At a minimum, 1, 2 chapters are fully prepared and there are drafts of the 3rd.  As a maximum - all 3 chapters are ready. </li><li>  Pre-defense completed and valuable feedback received </li></ul><br><br>  <i><b>Related Documents</b></i> <br>  <a href="https://docs.google.com/open%3Fid%3D0B9eXus9GJme9OWI0ZGI4NTktMTRjYS00YWVkLWI3M2QtOWQyMDU5ODhjNDcz">An example of comments to the work of our stream</a> ; <br>  <a href="https://docs.google.com/open%3Fid%3D0B9eXus9GJme9MDFjZWRmNDctMzk2ZC00MTFiLWE4NjgtYjJlYzE3NWY5Zjk0">The example of the presentation shown at the organizational meeting</a> ; <br>  <a href="https://docs.google.com/open%3Fid%3D0B9eXus9GJme9YTQ4ZThhNjktMDI5OC00YmMzLThlNzktNTc5ZWQzNmI5MjZk">The first version of my presentation</a> . <br><br><h4>  5. December </h4><br>  A week after the first preliminary defense, you will be announced the names of the consultants for the economic section and the Belarusian Railways, and will also remind you about the reviewer.  All these people will need to be seen before the second pre-defense, scheduled for the end of December. <br><br>  It's time to get the fourth and fifth chapters - someone gives them to them, some merge with common lokalki, the rest are taken from group mates.  But you can, of course, write it yourself. <br>  If your student is not from ITMO, ask him to fill out a piece of paper about your pre-diploma practice.  It is implied that you worked at the enterprise for some time and learned about the subject area - this is the pre-diploma practice. <br><br><h5>  Reviewer </h5><br>  This person will write an independent review of your work.  The reviewer may be a graduate who is an expert in the field and who is not an employee of the graduating department.  It does not have to be a teacher from our university, you can take anyone. <br><br>  Often, the supervisor may recommend someone from the teachers for this role.  It is desirable, of course, that the reviewer understands your area.  If you are developing something for a particular enterprise, it is worth taking a special from there.  Some took friends with higher education and wrote a review themselves.  Here the decision is yours - you need adequate feedback or extra criticism to anything. <br><br>  For approval by the reviewer, write an <a href="https://docs.google.com/open%3Fid%3D0B9eXus9GJme9NzZhNWU0NWMtZjMxNy00MGVhLWFmZTYtODliNzVhYjE3MTE0">application</a> by hand and hand it in to the SAC secretary.  Third-party reviewers should also provide a certificate of employment and a copy of the diploma. <br><br><h5>  Consultants </h5><br>  It is implied that these people should help you with the calculation of the economic efficiency of the started development and follow the safety review when working with the received software product. <br><br>  In fact, the content of these sections does not concern anyone, except these consultants.  We were lucky and both consultants understood what was happening, so they signed up without looking. <br><br>  It makes sense to go to the consultants when they publish the form of another lengthy document - <a href="https://docs.google.com/open%3Fid%3D0B9eXus9GJme9YjZhMmI0NWMtMmJmZi00ZWM2LWEyZjYtNzgzZGIzN2Y4MmFk">tasks for the WRC</a> .  Fill it together with an academic director, get his painting and go to the consultants together with the PT. <br><br>  Usually by this time you already have a 4-5 chapter (issued by a student, leaked on the network, taken from classmates).  Go over them with your eyes, edit very coarse paragraphs and go ahead.  From consultants you need signatures on the title page and the task for the WRC. <br><br><h5>  Pre-defense number 2 </h5><br>  At the end of the month, the second preliminary defense takes place, at which your work is considered somewhat more seriously and is allowed (or not) before the defense.  Everything is organized in the same way as the first one - the same audience, the same people in the commission - only more requirements, everyone wants a complete PP and program.  Of course, flaws are allowed, because you have another month to finalize them, but if one of the first three chapters is not ready, it will definitely be wrapped up. <br>  It is highly desirable that the fourth and fifth chapters and the signatures of the consultants for them are already present. <br><br>  The developed program must be able to demonstrate.  Even if you have not been asked to do this, try to have time to show, say, ‚Äúhere she is, it works!‚Äù.  There were cases when everything suits the commission, there are not many questions, they refused to look at the program, but in the end - ‚Äú <i>not allowed</i> ‚Äù with a justification ‚Äúthe <i>software product was not presented</i> ‚Äù (Oo) <br><br>  If you didn‚Äôt allow it - do not despair, there will still be the last chance in the form of pre-defense number three, but you have to be prepared that they will blow like a heating pad. <br><br><h5>  Total </h5><ul><li>  Received admission for protection </li><li>  PZ is fully prepared </li><li>  The program requires the last refinement </li><li>  Consultant signatures obtained </li><li>  Reviewer selected and approved </li></ul><br>  <i><b>Related Documents</b></i> <br>  <a href="https://docs.google.com/open%3Fid%3D0B9eXus9GJme9MWI1MmYyZmUtNGI0Yy00NTVjLWFhNzYtMjQ0NWU3ODdmNmM5">My fourth chapter (economics)</a> ; <br> <a href="https://docs.google.com/open%3Fid%3D0B9eXus9GJme9ZWE1YTkyNzgtNWJlZC00YjAwLTljZDgtOWFjNjUyOWE3MGZk"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">My fifth chapter (BC)</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> ; </font></font><br> <a href="https://docs.google.com/open%3Fid%3D0B9eXus9GJme9YTQ0NDJlZDAtZGIzOS00NTY3LTk1NTAtODA3ODBlNmIzMzBl"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The second version of my presentation </font></font></a> <br> <a href="https://docs.google.com/open%3Fid%3D0B9eXus9GJme9ZmQ1MjhiZGMtMjkzZS00OTFjLWFmYjctZWQ2N2VhNGU0NTdm"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The results of the second predzashchity</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> .</font></font><br><br><h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 6.

</font></font></li><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Note 2-3 weighty virtues; </font></font></li><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Tick ‚Äã‚Äã2-3 average shortcomings, preferably those that you can confidently and fully answer (you will be required to protect it). </font></font></li></ul><br><br><h5><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Feedback from the teacher </font></font></h5><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Nauchruk usually knows what and how you write and also writes in a </font></font><a href="https://docs.google.com/open%3Fid%3D0B9eXus9GJme9NDFiYmFhNTAtYjE0Mi00MDU3LTljOTItN2MwNGU2OWI1NGVh"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">pattern</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">General recommendations are similar to the reviewer, with the exception of shortcomings - usually they are not in the review of the academic director (after all, it was he who did your work and made sure that there were no obvious shortcomings).</font></font><br><br><h5><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Gosy </font></font></h5><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the middle of the month passes the state exam. Held in the audience number 100 (lektorka next to the dean's office) in the entire stream at once. If you still have an academy. debt-before the surrender of the state you will be allowed only through the dean. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Before the new year will publish the exact date and a list of questions. Requirement of the regulation - 3 unique questions per student. So, if the flow is large, there will be a lot of questions. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Subjects are all in their specialty, mostly 4-5 courses (have not everything been forgotten yet?)), But you still need to prepare. A good solution would be to gather an initiative group to prepare answers and share all the questions among its members. Then the answers merge together and spread within this group.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Despite the official ban on the use of electronic sources of information on state (printouts are possible), they are blind to this. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">So pour the answers to the laptop and go ahead. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Accept the same teachers that sat in the commission (¬±). </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Each teacher is given his subject. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There were 8 topics in total, you get 3 unique questions from different topics. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Since you still have to wait until the entire stream is finished (to sign a piece of paper), it is a good decision to turn in early and go to sign a bypass list.</font></font><br><br><h5><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Pre-defense number 3 </font></font></h5><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the near future, after the state, or even on the same day, the last pre-defense will be held for those who did not pass the second one. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Everything passes by analogy with the first two, but the commission is large and dumb, so get ready.</font></font><br><br><h5>  Protection </h5><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">By the end of January, the defenses finally begin. In our case, they dragged on for 3 days and were held from early morning in audience 180. Unlike predzaschit, everyone will be launched to the audience at once and you can see how your comrades are protected (well, you can pull up your friends by prior arrangement). </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Shortly before the protections, they will need to enroll. The record consists of the transfer of all the papers (listed at the very beginning of this period) to the SJC secretary and the choice of the day and the sequence number of his speech. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The unspoken rule says that on the first day excellent students go, on the second day they are good, on the third day all the rest.</font></font> Choose you. <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">As for the sequence number, the most advantageous places are the first and the first after the break. You can learn about the time of the break from the Secretary of the SJC. The first person is always given a discount, and the commission may not be at full strength, and after the break, they are still kind from the meal. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It will be necessary to throw the presentation on the computer in advance and in some way prepare a program for the demonstration. If this is a web-based IC, immediately open the site; if the server module, prepare a laptop. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">You show the presentation on the projector, tell the prepared speech, answer the questions and the shortcomings found (from the reviews). Speech should be told loudly, confidently and to the point. Nobody will forbid you to peep at a leaflet, but you shouldn‚Äôt depict a schoolboy with a report.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Simple and effective hint to improve the view of their work - handouts. All charts and diagrams from the presentation, on which there are small inscriptions, type in 10 copies and decompose copies into files and daddies. There are also more detailed diagrams that did not fit into the presentation, as well as various material that may be needed when answering questions. During the presentation, refer to the handout saying ‚Äúsee there for more details‚Äù. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">During the break, the commission leaves the snack and students should prepare a snack. Skins 200 rubles each and run to the nearest supermarket before starting defenses. Cheese, ham, bread, caviar, disposable dishes, tea / coffee and sweets for them (alcohol is not necessary, they may not understand). You carry all this into the audience 144, which is familiar to you in the defense of your defense, and set the table.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The rest seems to be nothing unusual - they waited for their turn, passed, waited for the end of the event, signed the protocol. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Congratulations, you are now a graduate!</font></font><br><br><h5>  Total </h5><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">You finished university! </font></font></b> <br><br> <i><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Related documents The</font></font></b></i> <br> <a href="https://docs.google.com/open%3Fid%3D0B9eXus9GJme9MTczZGNiYzEtM2E2MC00OGI1LTk4MjItNDUyMzRkMDI2Y2E4"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> final version of my presentation</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> ; </font></font><br> <a href="https://docs.google.com/open%3Fid%3D0B9eXus9GJme9ZWI0NDVlYzQtZjU4Mi00NzJlLWE1NjItOTY2YmIyNTc1MTc5"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Questions to the state</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> ; </font></font><br> <a href="https://docs.google.com/open%3Fid%3D0B9eXus9GJme9ZDk2Yzk4ODEtY2ZiMy00ZjdjLWIwNjctNzk1OGQ1ZDkyMTAy"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Answers to them</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> .</font></font><br><br><h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 7.
