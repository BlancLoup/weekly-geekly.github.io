  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Windows 10 uses machine learning technology to determine the possibility of an update.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b2b/c2e/32f/b2bc2e32f701a8cbc99f5104f92963f3.png"></div><br>  Windows users are not very happy about the fact that the system can be updated at any time.  For example, a person works on something important, tired, decided to drink coffee or something stronger.  It returns - and Windows is either in the process of updating, or has already been updated.  Of course, unsaved work results disappear.  Of course, we all understand that you need to be saved, but sometimes even the most experienced users forget about it. <br><br>  And then begins the hard process of recovering lost data - and well, if you can return at least something.  So, last year, Windows developers promised that the system would be more predictable in terms of updates.  And they really started to keep their promises. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Developers began to fix themselves with the release of <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4028685/windows-10-get-the-update">Windows 10 Creators Update</a> .  Users of the updated system, which downloaded the update and wanted to install it, began to receive a notification with three continuation options - installing and reloading the update, scheduled update, or the ability to postpone it.  In principle, it is quite convenient, and the operating system is ready to wait for the user's response as much as you like. <br><br>  Another odd thing was that updates could be installed at very different times.  The point is that two computers standing nearby could receive an update notification with a difference of several days.  Moreover, the characteristics of these PCs could be almost the same.

      After the release of Creators Update, which was already mentioned above, everything changed.  Yes, updates could still be downloaded at different times, but the time difference was no longer so great.  In addition, several more major and minor problems, both software and hardware, were solved. <br><br>  Now, the developers of the operating system have <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/07/windows-10-to-use-machine-learning-in-latest-attempt-to-make-reboots-less-annoying/%2522">promised</a> to make updates and the process of installing them even more convenient for the user.  Now the system will try to understand when it will be most convenient for the user to install the update. <br><br>  In particular, the system will monitor keyboard and mouse activity.  Especially closely, Windows will monitor the time intervals of inactivity.  With machine learning and predictive analysis, Windows will shape patterns of user behavior.  If the system "understands" that he left just to drink coffee, the update will not be installed.  If Windows decides that the user has gone far and for a long time, then the update is likely to be activated. <br><br>  Of course, the decisions of the system may be wrong, but it is still better than nothing.  Probably.  The developers have already stated that internal testing has shown the effectiveness of such an opinion - users who tested the new update method were satisfied with how Windows operates. <br><br>  By the way, the next Microsoft Windows 10 update, which has the code name Microsoft Windows 10, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/25/17279042/microsoft-windows-10-lean-edition">will include</a> a new edition of the ‚ÄúLean edition‚Äù.  It is designed for devices with a relatively small amount of memory, and will be installed on budget laptops and tablets. <br><br>  The new version of the OS can be installed on gadgets with 16 GB of memory.  It is necessary for even relatively weak devices to receive security updates on time.  After installation, such a system takes up 2 GB less memory than the main version of Windows 10. The developers have removed the registry editor, a number of desktop applications and some other programs from it. <br><br>  Now users of devices with 16 GB of memory are faced with the impossibility of updating the OS to the latest version.  This is because the drive is gradually filled with user data, including multimedia and other "heavy" files.  By the way, in the spring, when the next update was released in Windows 10, there was no option to change the default browser to follow links from the email client.  That is, if the system browser (Edge) is changed to any other, then the links from the email application still opened in Edge. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/418475/">https://habr.com/ru/post/418475/</a></p>
