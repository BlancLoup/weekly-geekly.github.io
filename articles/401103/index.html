Apple Macintosh History</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Exactly 32 years ago, Apple Macintosh was released - the first of a line of poppies, which now includes laptops, all-in-one computers, desktop computers, system units and servers.  <a href="http://qwintry.com/%3Futm_source%3DGeekTimes%26utm_medium%3DBlog_2017%26utm_campaign%3D1Q">Banderok</a> studied in detail the history of Macintosh, without which the world of computers would be very, very different, and also compared the Macintosh-1984 and MacBook-2017.  Read what happened ‚ûî <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ef5/9d2/bdd/ef59d2bddb2b4ae7a33c915e89b1a83e.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The Apple Macintosh was one of the last computers created under Steve Jobs to supervise him before leaving Apple in 1985.  The device became the first commercially successful PC with two ‚Äúchips‚Äù unpopular at the time: a computer mouse and a graphical interface.  They have been known for many years, but computers with a GUI cost a fortune (hundreds of thousands of dollars), the traditional command line was simply more convenient for many, because it was easier to adapt programs for it.  But the mouse for the dominant text interface at that time was simply not needed. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dbd/b5d/055/dbdb5d05501f4271bc73b97b6ad35feb.jpg"></div><br>  The first Macintosh laid the foundations of the new computer world, which we all know so well.  Suffice to say that one of the developers of the software for the first poppy was the team of Bill Gates.  In 1985, he offered Apple to sell their operating system under a license to other companies so that Macintosh OS could become the ‚Äúindustry standard‚Äù.  Gates did not respond to the proposal for six months, and as a result, Microsoft took the source code of the system and redid it into the first version of Windows - which looked and worked almost the same as System Software (the classical Mac OS was then called).  Three decades have passed, and the principles of the operating system remain the same - the convenience of working with a PC is primarily determined by the visual part - by what we see in the process.

    <h3>  <font color="#ff8300">Prehistory</font> </h3><br>  In 1981, the company Steve Jobs went great.  Apple II became the most popular computer in the world, and Apple grew into a 300 millionth business, becoming the fastest growing company in US history. <br><br>  Everything began to change in November 1981, when the IBM PC entered the market.  Mainly because of the price, it became the first mass PC in history.  Previously, only businessmen, corporations and scientists could afford computers, they cost $ 5-10 thousand each. And the IBM PC in the most expensive configuration sold for $ 3000, the cheapest version cost only $ 1,565 ($ 4,200 of the sample for 2017).  And at the same time, he could cope with all the basic tasks: read, search the database, display tables, transfer data. <br>  The Apple III computer ranged from $ 4,500 to $ 8,000 and lost to IBM for the price.  Apple has ceased to be the ‚Äúhottest‚Äù company in the world of computers, a competitor took the lead by selling two million IBM PCs in three years. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/034/88d/e22/03488de2264c4b5a9334d2b18c5a6e53.jpg"><br><br>  The ‚Äúapple‚Äù corporation had hope for the Lisa computer, but it, released in 1983, failed - again because of the high cost.  For $ 10,000 bought less than a hundred thousand computers.  The company released all new versions of its ‚Äúcash cow‚Äù Apple II, adding different prefixes to the name, but the technology apparently gradually became obsolete.  In 1983, Apple and IBM went nose-to-nose, far ahead of the rest.  Each managed to get about $ 1 billion in profits from the sale of personal computers.  At the same time, the industry was in decline, and the losses of the remaining dozens of companies far outnumbered IBM in figures with Apple.  No one could tell which firm would go bankrupt next year.  IBM had a technological advantage, she publicly stated her desire to become the absolute market leader.  Retailers and developers, who were initially enthusiastic about IBM sales, began to fear that this corporation would soon become a monopolist and begin to set its own rules.  Only Apple could compete with this monster. <br>  And here‚Ä¶ <br><br><h3>  <font color="#ff8300">1984</font> </h3><br>  A young woman runs through dark, gloomy corridors.  She - in red and white, all the rest - in prison robes or police suits.  On a huge screen, Big Brother aggressively talks about how everyone should choose a safe path and follow one ideology.  A girl throws a hammer at the screen, and everything freezes around.  A good male voice says: ‚ÄúOn January 24, 1984, Apple will introduce the Macintosh.  And you will see why 1984 will not be the same as in 1984. ‚Äù  The familiar apple logo appears on the screen. <br><br>  This ad was released at prime time - during the Super Bowl, the finals of the American football championship, and several million viewers watched it.  The video was shot by Ridley Scott, best known for the films ‚ÄúAlien‚Äù and ‚ÄúBlade Runner‚Äù.  Apple spent on its creation very serious money for those times, $ 1.5 million, but it was more than justified.  Advertising has become even more famous than the device itself.  She won dozens of awards and repeatedly headed the lists of the best TV commercials of all time.  The heroine with a schematic image of Macintosh on her t-shirt - breaking stereotypes and saving humanity from a dull life under the monopoly of IBM adepts who have seized the entire industry.  For those who were not aware of the situation on the computer market, it was just a cool movie, and for "their" - a demonstration of real confidence in the product.  All hold, came the IBM killer! <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OYecfV3ubP8" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <i>One of the most famous commercials in history: Macintosh and "1984" Orwell</i> <i><br></i> <br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúIn the world of personal computers, there have so far been two revolutionary products: the Apple II in 1977 and the IBM PC in 1981.  Today we present you the third such product - Macintosh.  We worked on it for more than two years, and the computer turned out to be incredibly good. ‚Äù <br></blockquote>  <i>Steve Jobs said at the presentation of the new device.</i>  <i>Then this assessment of Jobs, ‚Äúinsanely good,‚Äù was copied by many journalists.</i> <br><br>  The computer was what Lisa could not be.  Apple finally got a product for people, not for corporations.  Much credit goes to the computer interface specialist Jeff Raskin, who called the PC for the variety of his favorite apples.  His idea was to create a convenient and inexpensive device for regular customers.  In 1982, he left Apple to pursue his own small projects: he made expansion cards and interesting small PCs that did not have commercial success.  But his work attracted Steve Jobs, who was not inspired by the prospects of expensive Lisa.  Around the same time, Jobs found out about the breakthrough technologies of graphical interfaces developed by Xerox and made a deal with the company.  His experts got access to the Xerox research center, and in return, the manufacturer received options for Apple shares.  Thus, the Macintosh was the result of the work of two teams from two companies - as later <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/banderolka/blog/284446/">Powerbook (another success of Apple)</a> . <br><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúMacintosh is the best combination of performance and price in the (so far short) history of personal computers.  This machine will attract a lot of people who previously had neither the time nor the desire for a long time to learn all the tricks of the PC.  If there are no unforeseen technical errors, and by the end of the year a good library of programs will appear for him, Macintosh will become the next standard in the world of personal machines. ‚Äù </blockquote>  <i>Written in those years, a journalist and industry expert Bob Ryan.</i> <br><br><h3>  <font color="#ff8300">What's inside</font> </h3><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8bepzUM1x3w" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <i>Steve Jobs presents the first Macintosh in 1984</i> <br><br>  Most PCs, even those that worked on DOS, came with 64 KB or 128 KB of RAM and were equipped with one or two floppy drives for 5.25 ". Hard disks were not built in, the maximum was offered in the" extended "version for additional $ 1500. <br>  Macintosh stood out.  First, he had a mouse. <br><br>  Jobs was so confident that you would like to work with the mouse, so I just decided to remove the arrow keys for navigation from the keyboard, which everyone has long been used to and used in console interfaces.  The Ctrl button, by the way, was also missing.  Both arrows and ctrl were added in the next versions of the device. <br><br>  The mouse is a good solution, but far from the only one.  Apple was one of the first to use a 3.5 "drive on 400 KB. For comparison, the IBM PC had 5.25" floppy disks at that time, which kept only 320 KB of information. <br><br>  Well, the biggest difference became noticeable if you turned on the device.  He had a graphical interface!  Almost like the Xerox Alto and Lisa, only better and much cheaper.  Pixels here were square instead of rectangular, which helped transfer graphics to the screen.  And the interface was surprisingly similar to what we have now!  Look at the MacWrite window: here are the Apple, File, Edit, Search, Format, Font, Style drop-down menus, here‚Äôs the ruler, here‚Äôs the scroll down slider.  Everything is almost the same as in modern text editors, only in black and white and in low resolution. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/108/5a9/081/1085a90813b04feba5516859c883c9f3.gif"></div><br>  The device worked on a processor with a frequency of 8 MHz - 60% faster than a processor with 5 MHz for Lisa.  To reduce the cost of the device and make it available to the widest possible audience, the memory stopped at 128 KB, although they could have delivered 256 KB.  This allowed to bring down $ 200- $ 400 from the final price.  The solution was not ideal, and already in September 1984, the company was forced to submit ‚ÄúFat Mac‚Äù with 512 KB of memory.  And the original, ‚Äúold, warm and lamp‚Äù Macintosh was later called ‚ÄúMac 128K‚Äù. <br><br>  In the center of the kit was a 9-inch monochrome display.  The display resolution was 512x342 pixels and permanently set the standard for the desktops at 72 PPI.  On the keyboard, by the way, in addition to Ctrl and arrows, there was also no number pad and function keys.  Apple made such a move specifically - for software developers to start making applications specifically for the new user interface, and not just porting their programs from older platforms to the Mac.  The idea was not very successful, and then all the buttons had to be returned. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/662/092/123/66209212389a4d03bee78182106b4e3b.jpg"><br><br>  The main advantage of the platform was its price.  Most computers with a GUI then cost from $ 10 thousand, and the standard price for the first Macintosh was $ 1995 (slightly more than $ 4500 in the modern equivalent).  By the way, now <a href="http://qwintry.com/%3Futm_source%3DGeekTimes%26utm_medium%3DBlog_2017%26utm_campaign%3D1Q">Banderolk</a> can bring devices with about eBay at about the same cost: a vintage model in good condition with the original box is sold for <a href="http://www.ebay.com/bhp/macintosh-m0001">approximately $ 2,000, but there are lots and much cheaper</a> . <br><br>  Thanks to revolutionary solutions, a reasonable price and cool advertising, sales of the first poppies have been quite successful.  By April 1984, the company had sold 50 thousand models, by May 3 - 70 thousand, by the end of the year - 280 thousand.  50% more than expected.  This allowed Apple to bypass the IBM PC for the first time and gain a foothold again as a leader. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/081/ec3/09d/081ec309db474b69b2ba9c049bf1d484.jpg"></div><br><h3>  <font color="#ff8300">Feature Comparison</font> </h3><br>  Let's compare the old device with the modern Mac Pro - the most powerful personal computer of the Mac series.  And in terms of size and price in dollars, it roughly corresponds to the first Macintosh.  As for the characteristics ... <br><br>  The Macbook Pro processor runs at 3.9 GHz and is 500 times faster than the Macintosh 128K.  And this is not even taking into account the multi-core technology and Hyper Threading.  For RAM, the difference is even greater: 128 KB in the old model, 128 GB in the new model, that is, a million times more.  GPU cannot be compared at all; in the first Mac there were several chips for display control, which Apple estimated at 1 bit.  A Mac Pro can stand up to 1 GB or 6 GB. <br>  It may be easiest to realize the difference in the form of pixels.  The Macintosh hardware could power a monochrome display with a resolution of 512x384 (although the PC itself had a screen of 512x342).  This is 42 times less points than in a single 4K-resolution monitor.  A Mac Pro is designed for three such monitors.  And high quality: color and high PPI. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#ff8300">Mouse and GUI</font> </h3><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kU2pn_atWzQ" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Macintosh was the first personal computer that showed the general public what a mouse and a GUI are.  Previous attempts by Xerox and Apple itself failed miserably: users are accustomed to typing abstract commands on the keyboard, and then waiting for the machine to give them the desired string or response.  Now only programmers are engaged in this, and the rest click with a mouse or finger on the screen.  In 1984, this was something innovative and radical.  Objects from real life, like floppy disks, file folders and recycle bin?  A calculator that looks like a calculator?  Wow, all this is already so familiar and intuitive to the user! <br><br>  The most famous computer with a mouse before that was probably Xerox 8010, introduced in 1981.  The mouse there was even a two-button!  However, the device cost $ 16,500, that is, more than the annual salary of the secretary.  Few people wanted to pay that kind of money for a GUI or mouse.  As a result, sold less than 25 thousand cars.  A similar situation occurred with the Sun-1, and with Apple Lisa.  "Mechanical index device" remained beyond the limits of the review of almost everyone who worked with a PC. <br><blockquote>  It got to the point that some large corporate buyers of Macintosh believed that the device comes with a laboratory mouse, which is necessary for some experiments. </blockquote>  <i>And this is not a meme.</i> <br><br><h3>  <font color="#ff8300">Result</font> </h3><br>  Apple Macintosh was commercially successful and left what is called legacy.  He was followed by Mac 512K, Mac Plus, Mac SE ... What is it, poppies are still being produced, and there are more varieties than ever before.  The mouse and the graphic interface, as we see, also got accustomed - both in the form of Mac OS, and in the form of Windows, which borrowed many ideas from Apple and Xerox.  But at that, the very first poppy, the story is not very bright.  You can take it as a prototype on which Apple stuffed bumps. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-5zeJyQ31rM" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>  <i>Advertising Macintosh in 1984 - with Bill Gates!</i> <br><br>  Trying to repeat the success of his cult trail ‚Äú1984‚Äù with Orwell, in November 1984, Apple launched the second big advertising campaign.  In the States, just passed the presidential election, in which Ronald Reagan won.  Apple bought all 39 spots in the weekly Newsweek magazine dedicated to this topic.  For this, they spent as much as $ 2.5 million, but the potential coverage almost corresponded to the January Super Bowl.  On all pages, readers were invited to the ‚ÄúTest Drive Macintosh‚Äù: potential buyers could take the computer from the store to their homes for one day.  The advertisement worked, 200 thousand people tried the device, but many then simply did not return it, someone returned the poppy in poor condition, the retailers were not ready for such a model of work.  The company‚Äôs losses were so big that Apple‚Äôs executive director, John Scully, was forced to raise the Macintosh price from $ 1995 to $ 2,495. <br><br>  But it was only flowers.  This shitstorm happened in 1985, when the company decided to surpass its "1984".  Again the video was created, which this time was made by Tony Scott, brother of Ridley Scott.  Several million dollars were spent ‚Äî and ... <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/F_9lT7gr8u4" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  In January, Lemmings went under the Super Bowl.  Desert, dark sky.  A long line of office workers with blindfolds and cases in hand.  They go one after another, not knowing that ahead of them all their comrades are falling off a cliff.  The last employee removes his dressing and looks back at the same length at another such line.  A voice says, "We are presenting Microsoft Office."  EVERYTHING. <br><br>  Gloomy tone - and without some hint of a better future.  Comparison of their potential clients with suicidal lemming.  Apple tried to repeat the success of the previous year, but made two critical mistakes that nearly led to its collapse.  They say that the first presentations ‚Äúfor fans‚Äù on ‚ÄúLemmings‚Äù reacted positively, but they were followers of Apple, and the video seemed disgusting to the rest of the audience.  Sales of computers, of course, plummeted.  Apple had to close three of its six factories, lay off 20% of workers.  One of the victims of the situation was Steve Jobs, the company's founder.  The board of directors sided with John Scully, and in the spring, Steve was actually pushed out of Apple. <br><br>  Macintosh sold better than other computers in 1984, but it had serious flaws: serious business customers, who could easily pay a few extra thousands for higher speed, were disappointed with them.  The biggest problem was the number of programs.  Throughout the first year, only ten utilities worked on Macs, including MacWrite, MacPaint, MacTerminal, MacProject and Microsoft Word.  Of the programming languages, only MacBASIC and MacPascal were available.  Less than a quarter of the utilities available on the IBM PC worked on the system.  A new graphical interface, a mouse and a very strange keyboard only pushed the developers away, and no one rushed to transfer their programs to a new platform.  Although in 1984, 280 thousand Macintoshs were bought, and sales from IBM PCs did not exceed 100 thousand, many, including Apple directors, were worried about the future of this system.  The trend was helped by the Macintosh 512K and, to a greater extent, the Macintosh Plus, which was released in 1986 and was sold unchanged until 1990, but <a href="http://qwintry.com/%3Futm_source%3DGeekTimes%26utm_medium%3DBlog_2017%26utm_campaign%3D1Q">Banderolk</a> will tell about it somehow next time. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/415/5f6/e6c/4155f6e6c6064e57b9ab3d1732b6ecea.png"><br><br>  <b>Here is a reward for the most patient: a</b> couple of words about the Apple product, which will definitely not disappoint you.  <a href="https://qwintry.com/landing/apple/%3Futm_source%3DGeekTimes%26utm_medium%3DBlog_2017%26utm_campaign%3D1Q">iPhone now everyone can buy cheaper!</a>  <a href="http://qwintry.com/%3Futm_source%3DGeekTimes%26utm_medium%3DBlog_2017%26utm_campaign%3D1Q">Banderolka</a> buys phones in Germany and brings to Russia - it turns out 20% cheaper than in the nearest store.
