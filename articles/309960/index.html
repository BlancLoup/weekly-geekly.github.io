Despite the various risks and challenges to be faced with, enterprises continue to apply the business model of outsourcing in order to improve their business processes and increase investment. <br><br> <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/icl_services/blog/309960/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b8e/bd4/b9c/b8ebd4b9cc89412c802003fc7e1a5202.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  Here are some noteworthy statistics that you should take into account if you plan to introduce IT outsourcing into your company's practice or are still not sure whether they should be engaged in this quarter of 2016. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <strong>1.</strong> 92% of IT organizations that outsource disaster recovery state that costs are equal or less than in the case of internal functionality. <br>  - <i>Computer Economics</i>

      Disaster recovery is the most ‚Äúoutsourced‚Äù practice due to its cost-effectiveness, as well as improved cloud infrastructure, which improves overall performance.  However, to improve the technology takes time to train your team to work with the infrastructure, and also have to spend on installation.  That is why outsourcing comes to mind when you need to get the job done right. <br><br>  <strong>2.</strong> 65% of organizations that outsource application hosting plan to increase the amount of work outsourced <br>  - <i>Computer Economics</i> <br><br>  The recent growth of SaaS in the industry has led to the fact that this has become the most frequently and quickly outsourced area of ‚Äã‚Äãwork.  The growing demand for cloud applications has led companies to outsource most of their work in order to cut costs, use the current SaaS trend, and use cloud applications to the fullest. <br><br>  However, despite the fact that the number of cloud applications is growing, security issues, compliance with the rules and risks of data loss are the main obstacles for companies that prevent them from switching to the "clouds". <br><br>  <strong>3.</strong> Health IT outsourcing will grow in 2013-2018 with an average annual growth rate of 7.6% <br>  - <i>Statista</i> <br><br>  The healthcare industry processes a huge amount of data that must always be protected, so there is a growing need for a powerful IT infrastructure required to protect sensitive data.  Due to this, the industry's outsourcing is estimated to reach about $ 47 billion by 2017. IT outsourcing plays a huge role in data integrity, so healthcare institutions should include outsourcing in their business agenda. <br><br>  <strong>4.</strong> In the next 2-3 years, customers will want to receive better business services. <br>  - <i>KPMG</i> <br><br>  It has already been proven that outsourcing is one of the best ways to achieve a goal if you are focused on cost reduction and the highest quality results.  This is stated in a study that examined the position of IT outsourcing in the coming years, and according to which outsourcing will increasingly take into account savings (26%), quality improvement (21%), available skills (19%), financial and market flexibility (11 %). <br><br>  <strong>5.</strong> 31% of IT services are outsourced, and organizations will continue to do so for many years. <br>  - <i>deloitte</i> <br><br>  Outsourcing providers do not only reduce costs.  Indeed, if you want to use technological innovations, outsourcing guarantees ensuring the needs of your business in this regard.  In fact, IT outsourcing also creates various job opportunities and skills for both suppliers and customers. <br><br>  <strong>6.</strong> 89% of customers are satisfied with outsourcing contracts. <br>  - <i>Whitelane Research</i> <br><br>  If you think that outsourcing will not bring anything good to your business, service providers continue to prove the opposite, perfectly fulfilling all their outsourcing tasks.  By adding new points of view and skills to your business, you can be sure that it will be in safe hands. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/309960/">https://habr.com/ru/post/309960/</a></p>
