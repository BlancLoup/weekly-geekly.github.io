Recently, I began to study the noise-resistant codes and simulate the process of their work, and I realized that humanly written topics on this topic are quite a bit, or rather not enough.  There are tricky books, but they are tricky, that it takes time to study them, and sometimes you need to get some basic knowledge and ideas on the topic, for a very short period of time.  As an example, I can cite an article on <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/140611/">Hamming codes</a> , it helped me a lot when I was just starting to fiddle with codes.  Similar codes are available <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/111336/">here</a> . <br><br>  My topic is aimed primarily at practitioners.  Those who are interested in using such algorithms and get a small working application in a reasonable amount of time. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I would also like to clarify that the Chase algorithm is a classic example of noise-tolerant coding, and where it is now very rarely used alone.  But for understanding coding and learning issues, it fits one hundred percent, or maybe two hundred percent. <br></p><br><h4>  Some theory </h4><br><p>  Today, there are many different classes of error-correcting codes, differing from each other in structure, purpose, efficiency, coding / decoding algorithm, and others. <br>  In one approach, codes can be divided into two groups: <b><i>block</i></b> , in which encoding and decoding are performed within a single block of bits and <b><i>tree</i></b> , in which processing occurs continuously, without dividing the message into blocks. <br><br>  The decoding of the block code can be accomplished by <b><i>hard</i></b> or <b><i>soft</i></b> decision making.  In decoding with a <b><i>hard</i></b> decision, a value is assigned to each accepted bit in the demodulator <br>  0 or 1. A <b><i>soft</i></b> decision decoder accepts not only a binary value of 1 or 0, but also a confidence value associated with a given bit.  The decoder will use this <i>soft</i> information, and at the output we get the same hard decision. <br>  In short, the vector from the value 0 or 1 comes from the channel to the input of the hard decoder. The vector from the values ‚Äã‚Äã(-‚àû; + ‚àû) comes to the input of the soft decoder.  The use of soft decisions gives more opportunities, as it provides a wider maneuver to correct the arising interference. <br>  Chase's algorithm is a <b><u>block code with a soft solution</u></b> . <br></p><br><h4>  Chase Algorithm </h4><br><p>  Chase's algorithm is an understandable and relatively efficient error correction (interference) algorithm in the transmitted message.  The main idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe algorithm is to generate an array of code words that will contain the word closest to the received sequence.  The algorithm is based on the fact that if a word decoded by a conventional hard decision contains an error, then one of the ‚Äúnearest‚Äù code words to it most likely matches the transmitted one. <br></p><br><h4>  Work example </h4><br><p>  Chase decoder uses a hard decoder in his work.  Let's use the already mentioned Hamming decoder.  Once again I remind you that its description can be found <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/140611/">here</a> .  The only change, in our case, is the transfer of verification characters to the end of the message.

    </p><p>  1. Suppose we have an initial vector u = [1, 0, 0, 1]; </p><br><p>  2. We encode it using the Hamming algorithm and obtain c = [1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0]; </p><br><p>  3. Add parity check - with [8] = ‚àë mod 2. <i>It is worth noting that for these purposes it is convenient to use the extended Hamming code.</i>  <i>But it is better about him separately.</i> <br>  As a result, we obtain c = [1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1]. </p><br><p>  4. We introduce some noise and get the vector r = [-1.02, -1.1, -2, 1.95, 0.98, -2.34, -0.73, 1.97]. </p><br><p>  5. We use the <b>second Chase algorithm</b> .  It is characterized by the following method of generating an array of check code words: </p><ul><li>  Choose from the received vector r <b><i>p</i></b> least reliable bits, that is, p bits of the smallest absolute value.  The last bit in the vector is not taken into account, since it checks parity and can be calculated on the basis of other bits; </li><li>  Choose the number <b><i>v</i></b> = &lt;p; </li><li>  Generate an array of helper vectors <i>h</i> .  Consisting of vectors of long p, with all possible combinations of bits with a value of 1, the number of which in one vector should be no more than v, and bits with a value of 0 in the remaining positions (see example below); </li><li>  Generate an array of check vectors <i>e</i> .  According to the following rules: <br><ul><li>  Each vector must be one bit shorter than the vector r; </li><li>  The array of vectors must be the same length as the array of auxiliary vectors generated in the previous step; </li><li>  Each vector must consist of zero bits, except for the positions of the least reliable bits selected in the first step.  Bits from the array of auxiliary vectors h should be located at these positions. </li></ul><br></li></ul><br>  Now we will generate test vectors using our vector example r = [-1.02, -1.1, -2, 1.95, 0.98, -2.34, 0.73, 1.97]. <br><ul><li>  Let p = 3, then the positions of the least reliable bits are [1, 5, 7] (we number them starting with index 1), [ <b>-1.02</b> , -1.1, -2, 1.95, <b>0.98</b> , -2.34, <b>0.73</b> , 1.97]; </li><li>  Let v = 2; </li><li>  Generate an array of helper vectors <b><i>h</i></b> : <br>  h [1] = [0, 0, 0], <br>  h [2] = [0, 0, 1], <br>  h [3] = [0, 1, 0], <br>  h [4] = [0, 1, 1], <br>  h [5] = [1, 0, 0], <br>  h [6] = [1, 0, 1], <br>  h [7] = [1, 1, 0]; <br></li><li>  Generate an array of test characters <b><i>e</i></b> : <br>  e [1] = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], we use at positions 1, 5 and 7 elements from the vector h [1] at positions 0, 1 and 2, respectively, <br>  e [2] = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1], we use at positions 1, 5 and 7 elements from the vector h [2] at positions 0, 1 and 2, respectively, <br>  e [3] = [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0], we use at positions 1, 5 and 7 elements from the vector h [3] at positions 0, 1 and 2, respectively, <br>  e [4] = [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1], we use at positions 1, 5 and 7 elements from the vector h [4] at positions 0, 1 and 2, respectively, <br>  e [5] = [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], we use at positions 1, 5 and 7 elements from the vector h [5] at positions 0, 1 and 2, respectively, <br>  e [6] = [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1], we use at positions 1, 5 and 7 elements from the vector h [6] at positions 0, 1 and 2, respectively, <br>  e [7] = [1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0], we use at positions 1, 5 and 7 elements from the vector h [7] at positions 0, 1 and 2, respectively; <br></li></ul><br><p></p><br><p>  6. Demodulate the vector r and get the vector <b><i>y</i></b> .  y [i] = r [i]&gt; 0, then 1, otherwise 0;  And discard the last bit. <br>  y = [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1]. <br></p><br><p>  7. Generate an array of <i>sample sequences</i> <i><b>t</b></i> .  t [i] = y ‚äï e [i]. <br>  We get: <br>  t [1] = [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1] - y ‚äï e [1], <br>  t [2] = [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0] - y ‚äï e [2], <br>  t [3] = [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1] - y ‚äï e [3], <br>  t [4] = [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0] - y ‚äï e [4], <br>  t [5] = [1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1] - y ‚äï e [5], <br>  t [6] = [1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0] - y ‚äï e [6], <br>  t [7] = [1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1] - y ‚äï e [7]; <br><br>  This allows us to check the least reliable bits.  Namely, invert them, depending on the values ‚Äã‚Äãof the vector e [i] and then choose the value that will suit us best (see the next steps). <br>  Reliable bits will not be affected by these operations. <br>  If we used only hard decisions, we could not conclude which bits are the least reliable and check them. <br></p><br><p>  8. Apply a hard solution to t [i] (in this case, the Hamming algorithm), but leave the check characters, and we get an array of vectors s: <br>  s [1] = [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1], a tough decision for t [1], <br>  s [2] = [1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0], a hard decision for t [2], <br>  s [3] = [0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1], a hard decision for t [3], <br>  s [4] = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], a hard decision for t [4], <br>  s [5] = [1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0], a tough solution for t [5], <br>  s [6] = [1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0], a tough solution for t [6], <br>  s [7] = [1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1], a hard decision for t [7]; <br></p><br><p>  9. Add parity to s [i] vectors: <br>  s [1] = [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0], <br>  s [2] = [1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1], <br>  s [3] = [0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1], <br>  s [4] = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], <br>  s [5] = [1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1], <br>  s [6] = [1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1], <br>  s [7] = [1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0]; <br></p><br><p>  10. Conduct a modulation of the values ‚Äã‚Äãof vectors from the array s.  According to the formula s [i] [j] = 2 * s [i] [j] - 1: <br>  s [1] = [-1, -1, -1, 1, 1, 1, 1, -1], <br>  s [2] = [1, -1, -1, 1, 1, -1, -1, 1], <br>  s [3] = [-1, -1, 1, 1, -1, -1, 1, 1], <br>  s [4] = [-1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1], <br>  s [5] = [1, -1, -1, 1, 1, -1, -1, 1], <br>  s [6] = [1, -1, -1, 1, 1, -1, -1, 1], <br>  s [7] = [1, 1, -1, 1, -1, -1, 1, -1]; <br></p><br><p>  11. Find the vector nearest to the vector r from the array s.  Using <i>Euclidean distance</i> as a metric. <br>  evkl (s [1], r) = 21.96, for s [1] <br>  evkl (s [2], r) = <b>11.72</b> , for s [2] <br>  evkl (s [3], r) = 16.64, for s [3] <br>  evkl (s [4], r) = 27.24, for s [4] <br>  evkl (s [5], r) = <b>11.72</b> , for s [5] <br>  evkl (s [6], r) = <b>11.72</b> , for s [6] <br>  evkl (s [7], r) = 25.00, for s [7] <br><br>  We got several identical metrics.  We can choose any of the vectors s.  Let's select the first of them, that is, s [2] = [1, -1, -1, 1, 1, -1, -1, 1]. <br></p><br><p>  12. Demodulate s [2] and get the vector <b><i>res</i></b> .  res [i] = s [2] [i]&gt; 0, then 1, otherwise 0. <br>  res = [1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1]. <br></p><br><p>  13. We discard the check symbols of the vector res and obtain the original vector u = [1, 0, 0, 1], which was required to be transmitted. <br></p><br><h4>  About interference </h4><br><p>  Friends, I would like to note that the process of introducing (and modeling this process) interference in messages (described at the beginning of the topic) deserves a separate post.  And I did not want to inflate the topic with this useful, but in this context, superfluous information. <br></p><br><h4>  Epilogue </h4><br><p>  I wrote on Habr√© for the first time.  If anyone is interested, in the future I would like to consecrate the Viterbi algorithm, threshold decoders, possibly turbo codes.  I would be grateful for the constructive comments. <br></p><br><h6>  Literature </h6><br><p>  On this topic I advise - <i>‚ÄúCoding with error correction in digital communication systems.</i>  <i>J.
