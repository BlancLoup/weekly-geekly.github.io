I rummaged through the internet before I caught up that he didn‚Äôt understand ipv6 dns requests.  Attempting to disable ipv6 boot options yielded strange results; ping works, telnet, apt-get do not resolve names.  I also suffered, spat and found the provider‚Äôs DNS - it worked.

      Distribution of Ineta, Samba, DCHP server - everything went up pretty quickly, but you still need to read mana and edit configs, despite the presence of GUI configurators.  All the same, here Windows is still more convenient (well, too lazy for me to remember the names of keys, etc. - it's easier to put a tick in the dialog). <br><br>  I remembered the end of the nineties (98-99th year), when being a schoolboy, rearranging the 95th for the fifth time, then happily rolling 98th, writing a pack of handicrafts on a BASIC visual, I felt like a cool pepper and decided to put mysterious Linux to myself.  To be honest, I didn‚Äôt overcome it and postponed my first acquaintance until junior uni.  For 10 years, the jump is of course gigantic, but as a Linux desktop system as it was catching up, it remained.  I established myself in this by putting the second system on a working comp.  Everything seems to be fine, but something is not right - the GUI is not responsive, as compared to XP, everything slows down a bit (I tried it and 9.04).  If you need a typewriter or a surfing machine on the internet, there is generally a continuous ecstasy on the speed of setting up the system for these purposes (well, except for the empathy that the Russian gave to the crocodile, but I quickly pulled out my favorite qutIm). <br><br>  In general, Linux for me remained a system with which it is interesting, while you are setting up, but how you set it up - what else you don‚Äôt know.  For the server went bang.  But as a desktop, this system is clearly not for the lazy.  :) <br><br>  Summary - in 10 years the alignment of forces has changed little.  Systems have come closer though, but as a desktop, I wouldn‚Äôt put Ubuntu's mother :) Life after Windows is there, but its forms are still specific. <br><br>  Well, I still want to express my gratitude to the creators of this distribution, I did not expect anything more from the Linux distribution. <br><br>  PS: having received such interesting and very holivarny comments I want to summarize a little: <br><br>  - the article was not intended for holivar; <br>  - XP can be a home server - five years of operation is ample proof; <br>  - XP is easier and faster to configure to distribute an Internet, create a network balloon and download torrents; <br>  - ubuntu copes well with the same tasks; <br>  - ubuntu is somewhat more difficult to configure and longer, but then you sleep more calmly (no matter how you do not fear viruses); <br>  - I wouldn't put ubuntu to my mother - let Windows use it further <br>  - you want a similar home server, do it for the first time, and you have an extra evening - put ubuntu - you will sleep more calmly later.  Read ubuntu.com, ubuntu.ru and everything will work out for you. <br><br>  Ubuntu put the desktop - the other was not at hand. <br><br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/79985/">https://habr.com/ru/post/79985/</a></p>
