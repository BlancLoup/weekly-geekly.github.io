  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Details about the work of the Search Quality department</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The NY Times has published a huge article on how, who and why at Google changes its ranking algorithms.  The article provides a lot of interesting facts about how the Search Quality department works.  The contacted journalist spent the whole day there. <br><br>  As you know, fine-tuning the issue occurs in the search engine almost every day.  The search quality department of Google makes about six large and small changes a week to the ranking algorithms.  The process is led by 39-year-old Indian-born programmer Amit Singhal.  Like other elite programmers, he was awarded the honorary position of Google Fellow. <br><br>  After joining Google in 2000, Mr. Singhal developed a sophisticated document ranking system that takes into account more than 200 factors that are called ‚Äúsignals‚Äù in professional slang.  PageRank rating is just one of these signals. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Each of the 10,000 Google employees can use the special Buganizer system to report on a particular issue in the search results.  All of these messages (about a hundred a day) are reviewed by Amir Singal and several other top managers of Google, including <a href="http://www.habrahabr.ru/tag/%25CC%25FD%25F2%25F2%2520%25CA%25E0%25F2%25F2%25F1/">Matt Cutts</a> , head of the anti-spam department of Google.

      Some problems are quite obvious and they are eliminated without thinking.  For example, a recent search for the phrase [French Revolution] gave more results about the last presidential elections in France than about the real French revolution of the time of Louis XVI. <br><br>  Other problems are more complicated.  So, in 2005, the problem was considered, why there was no local store in the issue of [teak patio Palo Alto], which semantically coincides 100% with the query.  This is the Teak Patio store in Palo Alto (Theteakpatio.com).  Understanding this problem, Amir Singal launched "one of the most secret and closed internal programs" called Debug, in order to analyze the results of a search for a specific search query.  It became clear that the store is not in issue, because the incoming links were not enough weight, because small regional sites usually have low PR.  To correct this and similar situations, Amir Singal made adjustments to the ranking algorithms.  These changes affected all the small regional online stores in the world. <br><br>  In the second half of last year, many complaints to Buganizer were associated with the ‚Äúfreshness‚Äù parameter.  This is one of the parameters that affects the results of the issue.  Previously, those pages that have not been updated for a long time were considered more authoritative.  However, after launching the Google Finance service, Mr. Singal found that he could not find this site on the first page of search results.  It became clear that the algorithms should be changed and give the "fresh" pages more weight. <br><br>  Amir Singal could not make such a global change without authorization, so this spring he presented his calculations at the weekly meeting of leading search specialists at Google.  He gave a presentation on the initiative, which was called QDF (query deserves freshness).  The main idea of ‚Äã‚ÄãQDF is to find those pages that are mentioned in blogs and forums and, accordingly, are considered ‚Äúhot‚Äù.  Colleagues decided that QDF deserves a two-week test in one of the data centers. <br><br>  This is how the ranking algorithms are configured in Google. <br><br>  via <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/03/business/yourmoney/03google.html%3Fei%3D5088%26en%3Df003a2b328ec0a72%26ex%3D1338523200%26partner%3Drssnyt%26emc%3Drss%26pagewanted%3Dprint">NY Times</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/9433/">https://habr.com/ru/post/9433/</a></p>
