The money was returned in the pretrial order, for which a big store thanks.  It saved time for me and you.  It also reduced your expenses for my lawyer (in case I won the case, and I would definitely win), a penalty of 50% of the value of the transaction, as well as the payment of a penalty.  In addition, I would have demanded the return of the well-known cost of Windows 8, and not the amount that Lenovo defined. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ef2/e69/615/ef2e69615cabfbc0d3dad91f233a884c.png"></div><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/79f/962/32e/79f96232e689c0e24f423440c96f2949.jpg"></div><br><br>  That it is necessary to make for return of the eight read more. <br><a name="habracut"></a>

      The first thing you need to get a handbook for the return.  Download it <a href="http%253A%252F%252Fwww.rb.ru%252Fdop_upload%252Ffile_2009-02-12_10.57.39_mstax.pdf%26text%3D%25D0%259F%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D1%2581%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%2520%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B2%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%26l10n%3Dru%26mime%3Dpdf%26noconv%3D1%26sign%3D6aedea9d631e7bb432dcddbe3749436a%26keyno%3D0">here</a> . <br>  I read this training manual.  Now you can listen to it as an audiobook.  But keep in mind: this is a complex material, so for a more detailed perception you still need to have texts before your eyes.  This audiomethoda for those who want to quickly get acquainted with the training manual.  You can listen <a href="http://yadi.sk/d/jv1XZdl5CNowd">here</a> . <br>  <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/pvp/" class="user_link">pvp</a> can update the training manual when available.  New sellers excuse: return for windows 8 is not possible, because the key is sewn into the BIOS. <br><br><h1>  Where is the information? </h1><br>  Wednesday October 23, 2013 <br>  First, I went to the Lenovo website to find a refund process for os.  Nothing even close to this subject was found on their website.  On the Internet only non-working link <a href="http://www.pc.ibm.com/europe/microsoft/ru/os_return_policy.html">www.pc.ibm.com/europe/microsoft/ru/os_return_policy.html walks</a> . <br>  The only place where you can at least see what was there - web.archive.org/web/20120606043625/http://www.pc.ibm.com/europe/microsoft/ru/os_return_policy.html is the last backup page on the web archive. <br>  What is the situation with the return from them is generally not entirely clear.  There must be a current page with a description of the procedure! <br>  <a href="http://www.linux.org.ru/forum/general/9324066">This</a> forum contains a slightly tweaked version of the statement, pulled from the web archive, in odt format <br><br>  Thursday October 24, 2013 12:13 <br>  I called the Lenovo (8 499 705 62 04). <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">protocol</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  - Hello, tell me where can I find information about the return procedure? <br>  - Have you already purchased a laptop or not? <br>  - Not. <br>  - And which laptop you can get? <br>  - Lenovo IdeaPad Yoga 13 <br>  - He's with windows 8, huh? <br>  - Yes. <br>  - In our database there is the following information: from the time of purchase you have 15 days to contact the seller, but before that you do not need to activate windows. <br>  - Ie  I appeal to the seller, leave him a statement ... <br>  - Yes, yes, yes ... that you are giving up the operating system.  After that, they have this refund procedure. <br>  - Can I see a sample application somewhere? <br>  - The <b>seller must already know this procedure.</b> <br>  - Ie  sample i ask from him? <br>  - Yes, all this information is with him.  After the acquisition already. <br>  - Thank. <br>  - All the best. <br></div></div><br>  The bottom line: the manufacturer kicks the buyer to the seller.  Well, it‚Äôs generally more convenient for me to pick up money from the seller right away. <br><br><h1>  Conversation with the manufacturer </h1><br>  Saturday October 26, 2013 16:16 <br>  Second call to lenovo <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">protocol</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  - In order to improve the quality of service, the call can be recorded and distributed. <br>  [Well, they have a stupid system.  You need to call the serial number, which I do not have and repeat several times to the robot, that I do not have it] <br>  - Support Center lenovo, Vadim.  Listen to you. <br>  - Hello, tell me, please, your number, so that they do not immediately connect to the robot, but to you specifically. <br>  - Press 0 to connect with the operator. <br>  - And your specific number? <br>  - We do not have this, i.e.  usually distributed on the first free operator. <br>  - I have a long question, and I don‚Äôt want to explain everything from scratch to the new operator every time. <br>  - Everything is registered in our database. <br>  - Good.  What is your name again? <br>  - Vadim. <br>  - Vadim, I have such a question.  I called here, the support service about the return value of the OS, and I was told that the seller is engaged in the return. <br>  - Yes, it's true. <br>  - However, after calling the seller, it turned out that the seller does not do this (their specialists do not practice this).  In this case, who is to blame?  Lenovo or shop? <br>  - In principle, you were correctly told that the sellers are engaged in this.  <b>If the seller is not familiar with the return policy, give them our number and we will email them the return policy of the operating system.</b> <br>  - Specifically seller Player pv.  They said that they do not do this and do not know.  I told them that I already called you.  They should send you a request for instructions.  You can check? <br>  - Good.  And when exactly did you talk to them? <br>  - The conversation was on Thursday or Friday. <br>  - What is their email address? <br>  - Well, probably, "player ru" should be present in the title. <br>  ‚ÄúSecond, please ... Unfortunately, no.‚Äù  <b>No request came from them.</b> <br>  - OK, fine.  And another question: why the site does not have information about this procedure, and how then should the buyer even know that this is possible? <br>  - In principle, <b>this procedure is confidential and only for sellers.</b> <br>  - But the buyer must somehow find out that such a procedure exists.  And the instruction how to act? <br>  - Unfortunately, this is not on our site. <br>  - You can call your email address where you can send a request and I will ask you to reply to it in a letter. <br>  - Well, please tell me your email address, I will send you a test letter. <br>  - My@pochta.ru <br>  - I sent you.  Please look if received. <br>  - Yes, I received.  I will send a request to him.  Another question: what amount is returned when you refuse win8? <br>  - windows 8 simple? <br>  - Name both that and that, for information. <br>  - for Windows 8 idle time - 400r, for professional - 1600, in my opinion. <br>  - <b>Is this accurate information?</b> <br>  - <b>Yes.</b> <br>  - Well thank you. <br>  - All the best. <br></div></div><br>  Bottom line: Apparently, the player py did not send the request.  They misinform me.  Lenovo says infa returns are for sellers only.  What the??  Let's make a competent request to them, with links to articles that they violate (failure to provide information?).  And still it is necessary to demand a refund in the amount of the cost of the Windows version of Windows, and not the amount that some uncle invented backdating.  In the manual described.  I will now make a request. <br><br><h1>  Conversation with the seller </h1><br><br>  Sunday October 27, 2013 15:21 TopComputer.ru <br>  Boorish operator with a hint of irony in his voice, interrupts, mows under the fool ... <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">protocol</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  - In order to improve the quality of service, the call can be recorded and distributed. <br>  - Shop, hello. <br>  - Hello.  I want to buy a Lenovo IdeaPad laptop from you and return the pre-installed Windows operating system.  How does this procedure happen? <br>  - What to return, I do not quite understand? <br>  - The Windows operating system is installed on the laptop and I would like to return its cost, that is, to refuse it in accordance ... <br>  - <b>It is included in the price of the laptop.</b> <br>  - Yes I know. <br>  - <b>And in the guarantee.</b>  And we are not doing any eeee, well, tell me the product code, it will be easier this way. <br>  - 20523357 <br>  - Well, here goes the 13th Orange Yoga, so to speak.  It is installed windows eighth.  What do you want to do? <br>  - In accordance with the terms of the license agreement, I can refuse this operating system and receive from the seller the cost that was included ... <br>  - <b>With Microsoft you have to get this money.</b> <br>  - Not.  This procedure must be carried out by the seller, in accordance with the conditions specified by the manufacturer.  So you are a store. <br>  - Not.  <b>We do not do this.</b> <br>  - I called Lenovo's support service, they said that if the seller is not aware of this procedure, he will send a request and they will send him instructions on this procedure. <br>  - We do not deal with these very same options for selling this or that.  <b>We have this included in the warranty.</b>  I can not help you. <br>  - Not.  The warranty applies only to "iron", that is, only the laptop itself. <br>  - I understand you, young man.  I say what we can. <br>  - <b>That is, your store refuses to return the operating system, right?</b> <br>  - <b>Well, not that refuses, we just do not do these services.</b> <br>  - This ‚Äúservice‚Äù is defined by the manufacturer.  So you ... <br>  - We are not manufacturers.  We do not have to. <br>  - ... in accordance with the law ... <br>  - We do not have to, young man.  We do not have to. <br>  ‚ÄúWell, you can tell email where I can send this request in writing.‚Äù <br>  - No, I can not, I do not know ... And the email on our site.  Service dog topcomputer dot ru. <br>  - I will send a request there and ask to answer it.  Thank. <br>  - You are welcome. <br></div></div><br><br>  Sunday, October 27, 2013 15:30 <br>  Digitizer (digitik.ru) <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Hidden text</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  - In order to improve the quality of service, the conversation can be recorded and spread. <br>  - Shop, Sergey.  Good day. <br>  - Hello, I want in your store to buy a laptop Lenova IdeaPad Yoga 13 and abandon the pre-installed operating system.  It is Windows 8. <b>How do you do this procedure?</b> <br>  - This, well, at least with the seven, it was necessary to write an application to lenovo and until that time, the laptop seemed to get into the Lenov service.  So that they delete it all there. <br>  - Can you write a statement in your store? <br>  - Well, we did lenovo once.  About forty days took the whole operation. <br>  - Wow! <br>  - Now, wait five minutes, try to find. <br>  - Are you looking for procedure instructions? <br>  - Yes.  But for the time being ... but it also seems to remain through the service.  Well, yes, that is, through the service center. <br>  - You did the last time in the store? <br>  - Not.  Well, that is, the <b>laptop was left to us, we took it to the Lenovo service center, formatted it and returned it to us accordingly, we returned it back.</b> <br>  - Why so long? <br>  - We took it in principle pretty quickly, and then we just waited for the laptop from there, from the service. <br>  - Can I do this procedure with a courier, if I place an order with delivery?  If it is formatted, give these stickers to it, and ... <br>  - No, this is only through the service, because there will be a confirmation that ... There, in the first place, you will need to write a statement for the refusal of the operating system, and this is only for self-delivery. <br>  - And the application forms in your store there, yes? <br>  - Blank, I think, you can request something, it can even be in free form.  In general, we had this situation a couple of times.  Better on Monday, call back, I think they will be able to clarify. <br>  - Thank you very much. <br>  - Actually, a very rare situation.  Call, if that. <br></div></div><br><br>  Sunday October 27, 2013 15:38 <br>  Yutinet <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Hidden text</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  - In order to improve the quality of service, the conversation can be recorded and spread. <br>  - Hello.  The operator is listening. <br>  - Hello.  I would like to buy a laptop Lenovo IdeaPad and abandon the operating system pre-installed on it.  How do you do this procedure? <br>  - The manager will consult you in more detail.

How can you? <br>  - And this immediately comes pre-installed.  Because your computer will be in the box and there will already be preinstalled windows eighth. <br>  - I know.  I say that I want to give it up.  There, in accordance with the license agreement in the agreement of Microsoft, it is written that I can refuse it and demand the seller to return the funds paid for it.  They are included in the price of the laptop. <br>  - I will now try to clarify this question, because this is the first time a person wants to return the Windows installed on the computer.  Thanks for waiting.  You see, we have all these laptops are supplied by the manufacturer and this is the factory Windows eighth.  We, unfortunately, can not ... You see, it comes to us closed in a box.  We can not take it open yourself and start deleting something there. <br>  - I understand.  I purchase it, open it, then write to you a statement of rejection and the store owes me a refund.  Here I ask how? <br>  - <b>About the refund, I can not say.</b> <br>  - I called in Lenovo, the manufacturer.  They said that if the seller is not aware of how this procedure takes place, then he should send them a request and send you to Lenovo.  Their telephone number is 8 (499) 7056204.  Can you tell the email from which the request will be made so that I can ask them what the status of the request is? <br>  - We have one email - this is yutet ru.  We do not have any personal.  See, it‚Äôs just not a fact that you are in this case ... I, unfortunately, now have no older people.  This has to be resolved ... I don‚Äôt know just how to tell you, because we have never returned money ... <br>  - This is the manufacturer and said that if the seller does not know, then he should make a request in Lenovo, and they should send instructions. <br>  - It's not a fact that those who are older say ‚ÄúYes, well, do it‚Äù.  It is necessary that the organization also went for it.  I can not tell you that I will return the money now and that's it.  This issue will not be solved by me. <br>  - I see.  Then pass on to those who are taller than you to ... <br>  - I will clarify this question.  Your phone number? <br>  - 8,916. <br>  - I will now try to find out in general about this issue, what and how in general as a whole.  I'll call you and tell you if this is possible or not possible. <br><br>  [mobile call] <br>  - I clarified.  Unfortunately, they said it was impossible. <br>  - <b>You called in Lenovo and said that it is impossible ???</b> <br>  - <b>I called not in Lenovo, but with my elders talked.</b>  <b>They said it was impossible.</b>  <b>We go completely with windows 8.</b> <br>  - And when will these yours be, as you yourself called them "elders" to talk with them? <br>  - It's only on Monday. <br>  - They only weekdays? <br>  - Yes.

And the more so by the way, Lenova ideapad, yoga which, this is like a tablet, you can skzat. <br>  - Yes, I know.  I just want windows back and put on it Linux.  It is actually possible to do this, just some stores interfere with this procedure.  Squeeze the email store where you can send a request. <br>  - Why don't you buy from Lenova herself? <br>  - I want to buy from you, because you have cheaper. <br>  - <b>Unfortunately, I doubt that this will be possible.</b> <br>  - Tell the store email. <br>  - He is on the site, if you open it.  We have mail as if attached.  I can only say my mail - this is the maximum. <br>  - I need a store mail.  I want to ask, so to speak, officially, why there is no such procedure? <br>  - I do not have a general mail.  No general mail. <br>  - Tell me yours then.  Is it your work? <br>  - This is working. <br>  - Well, that is, there you can formally submit a request, right? <br>  - That you will send me a letter, I will answer you the same. <br>  - I will try then to call when there will be "elders". <br>  - So, well, look at the site below ...

How does this happen in your store? <br>  - It's impossible. <br>  - How is this impossible?  This is a regular operation, it is determined by the manufacturer.  Any store should do this. <br>  - We do not have this.  We have what system comes from the supplier, with such it is sold. <br>  - Do you have someone more competent in this matter? <br>  - I explain to you, we do not have that.  Any manager will tell you the same thing. <br>  - I read on the Internet that in your shop several times already bought with the return of wasps, and everything was fine. <br>  - Without Windows, you can buy if the model originally went without windows. <br>  - The fact is that the Windows license agreement states that you can refuse to accept the agreement and I can ask the seller to refund the funds paid for the rights to use the OS, along with the computer. <br>  - I understand, but we do not have such a ‚Äúservice‚Äù now on Windows 8. That is, if there is some kind of system, it remains.  You can demolish yourself. <br>  - I myself can take down.  But understand, I do not want to pay what I do not need.

Passed to the service department and claims (he is in the same building). When the turn came to me, I said that we would draw up a waiver of Windows. The man was surprised, said that he didn‚Äôt know such a thing and called the head of the department (I corresponded with her). </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">She said that they would not return anything to me. The written statement about the refusal to accept refused, saying that our refund is not being made, and this statement means nothing to them. As a result, I was asked to write a complaint. I wrote to the mournful book that I intend to apply to the Federal Service, and promised to send the claim to the address. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The next day, Alyona called and said that Lenovo had told them the rules of procedure. This conversation turned out to be very interesting. But I will not give it in order not to overload the article.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For a refund, I had to take a look: a sales receipt, a statement, a Windows sticker, a serial sticker. I sent all this to Alena's post. She sent these photos to suppliers, and they in turn in Lenovo. From Lenovo it was necessary to find out how much money I need to return. After receiving confirmation from them, the answer goes down the chain. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The answer did not come all. I asked several times what state the question is in. It took about a week. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I prepared a claim that I intended to send them to juradres. And literally a minute before going to the post office, a letter arrived that you could come to collect money.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">On November 13, 2013, I arrived at the store, gave the original disclaimer, on which the Windows sticker was pasted. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I wrote an application for repair, where I specified a Windows 8 preset in the malfunction, and in the request I asked to return the money for it. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There was still more paperwork. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I went to the cashier with this, signed that the requirement was met, I have no complaints, crossed out Windows 8 in the check and gave me the money. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Plus, I received a gift flash drive for 8 gigabytes from a note. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At least some encouragement for choosing an expensive store =)</font></font><br><br><h1><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> What to do next </font></font></h1><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">So, I spent 3 weeks on it. The result, of course, is positive, but not everyone is ready to spend so much time on socially useful work. Further it will be easier and easier, so I ask all habrovchan and visitors of the site: please, if you do not need windows, do not pay tribute to the sweet. Try to get things done like me. On the positive side, it can be noted that I have become much better oriented in the Law on Protection of Consumer Rights. This knowledge will not be superfluous. See, more than once will come in handy. I can also say I pulled one store on the White List. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Next time I buy a computer, I'll go to another store. And I will definitely make this return. If someone is now planning to perform the same operation as me, then go to the Topcomputer. They must be put in place for rudeness to the buyer.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Of course, it is advisable to make our history public so that we all see the result. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Now about the complaint to the supervisory authorities. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Lenovo never notifies consumers that it is possible to refuse Windows. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">On the website of their store there is old age (outdated news) about the return procedure, in which there is no talk about windows 8. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This was first decided to use in the service department in Notik. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I have so far changed my mind to file a complaint with the FAS on Lenovo, since it is the only manufacturer who has determined the return procedure from the seller. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It would be better to file a complaint against all other manufacturers who drive the consumer to the SC.</font></font></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/199080/">https://habr.com/ru/post/199080/</a></p>
