  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to solder the broken leg of the processor</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello! <br>  Recently, I saw here topics about repairing iron.  This topic is very interesting to me, as I myself often repair all kinds of hardware.  I am familiar with computers widely enough, but repair is my job and in a sense, a hobby.  I didn‚Äôt specifically study this business anywhere, I don‚Äôt know electrical engineering, I teach everything by trial, the benefit of iron is enough. <br>  In this article I wanted to tell about the repair of processors, namely about the cases when they lose their legs.  I had to repair this patient last week. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Athlon XII 630 processor: <br><br><img src="http://www.gbu.ho.ua/HB/p0.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  4 nuclear chip, fell when assembling a computer and lost a leg (fell out of my hands) It is clear that with such a chip you don‚Äôt even need to poke a replacement service, one way to solder a leg.  I have come across such cases before, because now I already knew what to do and soldered the chip in about two minutes.  First you need to come up with something to replace the leg, of course with a wire, at first I thought of a wire from a twisted pair but it is too thick, after thinking and trying it, the best option was a wire from an 80 pin pin.  I would say that, for example, from a 40-pin pin is bad, since there were many lived inside the wiring, and at 80 contact plume everyone lived from separate wiring.  These wiring is well sucked. <br>  On the right is the loop that we need <br><img src="http://www.gbu.ho.ua/HB/p2.jpg" alt="image">
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      And so we cut off the posting of 2-3 centimeters, on the one hand we trim a little (it turns out even just with the nails!) And bend the tip of the wiring literally a millimeter, just to the side.  This will be the basis of the processor leg that we solder to the contact pad on the processor. <br><br><img src="http://www.gbu.ho.ua/HB/p3.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="http://www.gbu.ho.ua/HB/p4.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Now the processor.  With him, you must remove the rest of the legs if there is one.  The leg of the processor is as follows: <br><br><img src="http://www.gbu.ho.ua/HB/noga.GIF" alt="image"><br><br>  The most important thing is if the leg is no longer soldered off and a round footboard, so that only the contact point is left on the processor.  I soldered this processor with a 25-watt Soviet soldering iron, although I did such a 40-watt one.  My leg has disappeared from the platform, but if it remains, then it is easy to remove it with a soldering iron, the main thing here is not to shake hands.  In place of the soldering-soldering, you first need to drop the flux, the usual of rosin and alcohol, no fiction ... So the site is removed: <br><br><img src="http://www.gbu.ho.ua/HB/p1.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Now we will solder a little bit of solder to the place of contact, we will make such a ball. <br><br><img src="http://www.gbu.ho.ua/HB/p5.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Then our leg is from the wiring, we will prick it at the end where we bent the wiring.  Well, now soldering.  Since our leg is long, we can normally hold it with one hand and solder the other.  Here, without unnecessary gestures, preferably with one approach, gently solder the leg. <br>  You should get something like this: <br><br><img src="http://www.gbu.ho.ua/HB/p6.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Well, almost everything, now it remains only to bite off with a nipper part of the leg that is too high in comparison with other legs.  It is also advisable not to make a large snowdrift of tin at the place of soldering the legs so that the processor sits normally.  And the foot must be soldered so that it is parallel to the legs in other rows, that is, ‚Äúappendicitis‚Äù which we bent on the soldered leg should slightly protrude beyond the contact pad on the processor, to the outside, of course, so as not to accidentally short the other leg.  It is made to keep your foot tight, as I do not think that when sealing a simple vertical leg, it will hold tight. <br><br>  Now everything, put the processor in the computer, turn on and enjoy.  Everything works everyone is happy. <br><br><img src="http://www.gbu.ho.ua/HB/p7.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Whoever wants to try, I recommend first training on some athlon XP, there legs are still quite large. <br>  Plus I want to add so that those who have new systems for intel are not happy, even though there are no legs on the processor, but they are on the socket and if they break, you can‚Äôt solder. <br><habracut></habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/91232/">https://habr.com/ru/post/91232/</a></p>
