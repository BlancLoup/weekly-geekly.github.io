  <section class="page js-page"><h1>DataPro Data Center: cooling and fire suppression systems</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  A bit about the DataPro project.  In the <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/hostkey/blog/277355/">previous article,</a> we talked about the uninterruptible power supply and diesel-rotary UPS systems (DRUPS) of the DataPro data center, which has a certificate of compliance with the availability level of the Tier III Uptime Institute.  DRUPS almost completely eliminate the possibility of failure of the backup power supply system and reach the operating capacity in just a few seconds. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/418/7df/f48/4187dff487aff8b2428a085f2444953b.jpg"></div><br>  Now we will talk about the cooling and fire suppression systems used in DataPro.  Under the cut there are more details and a video of the response of the gas extinguishing system during the test trials. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  <font color="#ff6f00">EcoBreeze cooling system</font> </h2><br>  In a typical data center, the value of PUE (Power Usage Effectiveness ‚Äî defined as the ratio of the power consumed by the entire data center to the power consumed by IT equipment) reaches an average of 1.6‚Äì2 due to the power supply of the cooling systems.  Therefore, manufacturers of this equipment have long been trying to develop more efficient systems.  One of these solutions was a modular system of free cooling (free cooling) with additional irrigation - EcoBreeze. <br><br>  The DataPro data processing center houses one of the first and largest EcoBreeze cooling system installations from Schneider Electric in Russia.

Unlike other free cooling systems, two methods of free cooling are used here: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/99f/4b5/06f/99f4b506f00b35adf4dfea043282f577.jpg"></div><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/adf/f9f/491/adff9f49190ef206cbef91c1d7e14ea8.jpg"></div><br>  <b>1.</b> Cooling of air flow, during which there is a heat exchange between the cool outside air and the hot air from the data center premises, without mixing them.  In the heat exchanger, improved materials are used to transfer heat from one air stream to another. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/051/d7a/4ba/051d7a4ba40f0f4ded6fa0bba839000b.jpg"></div><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/972/017/3fb/9720173fb21e8b07e7043ab91396cc37.jpg"></div><br>  <b>2.</b> If the outside air temperature is not low enough for cooling, the system switches to the additional irrigation mode - the surface of the heat exchanger is covered with a thin layer of water. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f89/ab7/edd/f89ab7edd97608273ac3853c24744236.jpg"></div><br>  In an extreme case, when the irrigation system is not enough, EcoBreeze has a third mode of operation - the freon cycle with a variable performance compressor.  In essence, this is a classic freon air conditioner, designed to provide year-round cooling. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/da9/90d/93f/da990d93faf634351fbd9ca73e73ffde.jpg"></div><br>  EcoBreeze solutions are installed outside the data center, without occupying a usable space in it.  After the factory assembly, the system modules are pre-tested and mounted on the object. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b79/26a/d38/b7926ad389091a8ec652359f28648eaa.jpg"></div><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4ff/01f/b60/4ff01fb60f0a1faa0943f1cebf688b32.jpg"></div><br>  <i>The air conditioning system of the data center EcoBreeze is supplied as 50 kW modules, which can be combined into groups of up to four (200 kW) or eight (400 kW) modules.</i>  <i>The modular design allows the system to scale for cooling capacity. This approach allows you to purchase equipment that meets current requirements for data center air conditioning, to save both initial investment and operating costs.</i>  <i>In addition, the modularity of the system provides redundancy at the module level and its operability during maintenance or repair.</i> <br><br><h2>  <font color="#ff6f00">How does she work?</font> </h2><br>  We now consider in more detail how it all works.  Released in 2010, the system today continues to be an advanced solution.  In 2014, Schneider Electric began mass production of EcoBreeze.  So far around the world mounted a little more than two dozen systems. <br><br>  So, for maximum energy efficiency, the data center EcoBreeze takes advantage of the climate, and it provides <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/apc/blog/131246/">several cooling methods</a> <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/apc/blog/131246/">with the ability to automatically switch between them</a> : <br><br><ul><li>  With direct air heat exchange, only electronically-switched fans are used for cooling, and the EcoBreeze air economizer operates in a heat exchanger mode.  In direct air heat transfer mode, hot air is pumped by electronically switched fans through indirect evaporative cooler (IEC) channels.  After the initial cooling, the air leaves the IEC, passes through the air-conditioning system and returns to the data center. <br><br></li><li>  If the ambient temperature exceeds the threshold of + 7 ¬∞ C (this value can be adjusted), additional irrigation is activated.  Indirect evaporative cooling is used: air is cooled due to the evaporation of water from the outer side of the heat exchanger channels. <br><br></li><li>  At high ambient temperatures (+ 27 ¬∞ C and above), the freon circuit is connected, the compressor of which has frequency regulation. </li></ul><br>  Thus, at low temperatures, the system dispenses with and without water, and without freon, working only from the surrounding air.  When the ambient temperature rises, irrigation is activated, and if that is not enough, compressors are used. <br><br>  In our climate, most of the year EcoBreeze can cool the IT load without turning on the freon circuit, spending a minimum of electricity.  It is believed that the use of EcoBreeze in conjunction with other energy-efficient components of the engineering infrastructure of the data center allows for an average annual PUE of 1.25‚Äì1.3. <br><br>  Outside air does not mix with air from the data center, water and freon are not allowed into the machine room.  And to increase capacity, you can simply add EcoBreeze modules. <br><br>  The intelligent control system and redundant EcoBreeze air economizer components are designed to ensure high reliability and availability of the data center cooling system. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ab5/da4/b6e/ab5da4b6e32fa29708b3d28bc574d04a.jpg"></div><br>  <i>The EcoBreeze system provides indirect freaking (i.e., the outside and inside air are not mixed) with additional irrigation of the air-to-air heat exchanger: evaporating, the water cools the outside air, the cooling tubes through which the internal circuit air is transmitted.</i> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/22d/d23/080/22dd230809bed39368564784418376c4.jpg"></div><br>  <i>The entire data center air conditioning system is located outside of it.</i>  <i>In DataPro, it is mounted on the roof of a building.</i>  <i>Five such systems are now installed with eight modules each.</i> <br><br><h2>  <font color="#ff6f00">What does this give?</font> </h2><br>  This technology allows a significant part of the year to spend electricity only to power the fans that supply air from the data center and back, as well as the fans that blow air through the heat exchanger.  For systems like EcoBreeze, the efficiency ratio (Coefficient of Performance, COP) may be several times higher than the best classical chiller systems.  In addition to energy savings, the area gain is also achieved: alternative solutions take up twice the space. <br><br>  According to experts, for the Moscow climate, the power consumption of the EcoBreeze system is about three times lower than that of a chilled-water system, and about six times lower than the power consumption of a freon system.  In addition, due to the possibility of redirecting air flows generated by EcoBreeze from one machine room to another, DataPro managed to increase the utilization rate of the cooling system's power to 80% in the DataPro data center.  For 3-4 months in a year, EcoBreeze works ‚Äúin full force‚Äù, the rest of the time it operates in free cooling mode. <br><br>  Two 260 m3 fire tanks are used as reserve water tanks, which can be used for problems in the urban water supply system.  Water is recycled, but requires regular updating due to pollution.  In the summer, about 200 m3 of water a month is spent.  Normal consumption is only 20-30 m3 per month. <br><br>  Another feature of DataPro data center: the connection of freon tracks of air conditioners in it is made without soldering, using fittings.  This implementation allows for rapid installation and repair without performing flammable work. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/761/fdc/688/761fdc68888377d7229d53c178a0bcc1.jpg"></div><br>  <i>An example of the data center cooling system operation with display in the dispatch system.</i> <br><br>  Now the calculated load on each hall is 260 kW.  Design load on the hall - 360 kW.  In the course of certification on Uptime Tier III, one EcoBreeze system was turned off completely, and all the machines operated at full design load (5 halls of 360 kW each).  If more than two EcoBreeze modules fail, backup freon air conditioners will start. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a10/284/ced/a10284ced94680527fedb0ac0a8519d4.jpg"></div><br>  <i>Detailed information on EcoBreeze.</i>  <i>The numbers show the actual loading of the modules.</i>  <i>Indicators show when to change or clean air filters.</i> <br><br>  Why, in the DataPro Data Center, are freon air conditioners also used?  In fact, they have a double function: in addition to redundancy, they serve to maintain the desired level of humidity.  In addition, to maintain the required level of humidity, a separate adiabatic humidification system is installed in the machine rooms of the data center. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d07/078/b49/d07078b498737649a998eaac084770af.jpg"></div><br>  <i>EcoBreeze control panels in the DataPro data center control center.</i> <br><br>  It was originally planned to deploy 26 EcoBreeze installations with a cooling capacity of 350 kW each in the DataPro Data Center.  This would be one of the largest installations of the system in Europe.  However, to date, mounted eight systems EcoBreeze. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d75/e2b/d80/d75e2bd805140d52f7de722e24e71587.jpg"></div><br>  <i>The scheme of cooling machine rooms.</i> <br><br>  The system made it possible to carry out a phased deployment and achieve a high energy efficiency ratio. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#ff6f00">EcoBreeze Operation Specific</font> </h2><br>  EcoBreeze system is not suitable for all data centers.  The fact is that for its placement a considerable area will be required, during commissioning it may be necessary to make certain ‚Äúimprovements‚Äù, and its maintenance places high demands on the qualifications of personnel.  The next point we talked about earlier is that EcoBreeze should be used in large-scale projects with a load close to 100%.  It is in such conditions that the system demonstrates the best PUE indicator, in the calculation of which it is necessary to take into account, among other things, the flow rate for the water supply that requires ‚Äúwater treatment‚Äù - reducing the level of hardness.  You should also pay attention to the high capital costs for the purchase and installation of modules compared to freon air conditioners of equivalent capacity.  Separate nuance for data centers located in the city - requires regular replacement of HEPA air filters in the system of direct free cooling, which in some cases may cost more than the electricity saved by it. <br><br>  Thoughtful planning will always help to evaluate the prospects of a project, as well as to find possible ways of leveling the minuses.  For example, DataPro provided for almost everything, in particular, to optimize operating costs, instead of branded air filters from an equipment manufacturer, they use their own production of non-woven filter material. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#ff6f00">Vesda fire extinguishing system</font> </h2><br>  The fire safety system in the DataPro data center is implemented using Autronica‚Äôs Vesda equipment, and biologically safe gas, freon 227, is selected as the fire extinguishing agent for the gas extinguishing system. The freon is distributed to the protected volume of the premises using piping and radial nozzles.  The extinguishing agent is placed in gas extinguishing modules. <br><br>  The machine room is equipped with the Vesda super early smoke detection system, which uses a laser gas analyzer to monitor the hot corridor air.  Using a gas analyzer, an early fire and smoke detection system constantly analyzes the composition of the air.  Unlike conventional office smoke detectors, this makes it possible to detect signs of fire at the earliest stages and prevent damage from fire. <br><br>  The gas analyzer detects the presence of impurities that are typical for burning plastic or insulation.  When such impurities are detected, an alarm message is given.  To avoid false alarms, the gas extinguishing system operates in manual mode, that is, it is started by the engineer on duty and the security officer with a significant fire. <br><br>  When an alarm message is received, the personnel, acting according to a predetermined plan, checks for the presence of a fire source and, if detected, activates a fire extinguishing system or simply uses a fire extinguisher, de-energizing the corresponding server or rack.  This allows you to avoid accidental operation of the system and adequately respond to events such as the appearance of smoke from a faulty capacitor in the server. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/320/a9d/35f/320a9d35ff5f3827583f35b6bf3f8697.jpg"></div><br>  <i>If, for example, a high carbon concentration is detected, the system gives an alarm signal to the control center of the data center and to the security desk, indicating a possible fire on the corresponding indicator.</i>  <i>The numbers on the fire alarm system panels show the level of the laser signal.</i> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/170/5bc/334/1705bc334ed3ff1f569a28c151349c3e.jpg"></div>  Unlike most other data centers, the fire extinguishing system in the DataPro data center was tested in a ‚Äúcombat‚Äù mode: a fire was simulated, as a result of the system‚Äôs operation after the personnel evacuated, the machine hall was filled with carbon dioxide, the fire in the absence of oxygen was quenched, and carbon dioxide was pumped out of the hall .  In addition, regular exercises and staff training are held. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/tKYAWwWwYpU%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,1500004,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhmdae0pqgVJkAOXPYKkDCqY7jgfQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <i>How did the test fire extinguishing system.</i>  <i>We recommend to reduce the sound, because</i>  <i>the alarm is impossible not to hear.</i> <br><br>  Additionally installed Bosch fire alarm system.  Some DataPro customers, in accordance with their corporate standards, require the installation of additional fire protection equipment, in which case the systems necessary for them are installed. <br><br>  All data center equipment and client equipment is insured. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/47e/b80/e57/47eb80e57107c2b0f82f1eca618a2c35.jpg"></div><br>  One of the data center clients initiated an external audit of the data center.  According to the results of the audit, an automatic gas fire extinguishing system was additionally installed in the RP-10 kV room especially for this client.  In the initial project, the installation of this system in the RP was not envisaged. <br><br>  Currently, gas fire extinguishing is provided in all machine rooms, rooms of cross-over and diesel-rotary UPS.  The system is able to cope with a fire at the same time in two engine rooms and has a 100% reserve, which will allow it to stop the fire in two more rooms within a minute.  After that, recharge cylinders will be required. <br><br>  Corporate data centers for "monoclients" today learned how to build many Russian integrators.  Commercial data center is a completely different story, here are several different requirements for life support systems.  We will continue the story about this in our next materials on DataPro data center. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/61d/cc6/44e/61dcc644e7d834198993e19d4a1d0bd7.png" align="left"><br>  DataPro places projects from one rack, and the client should also independently agree on cooperation with telecom operators. <br>  <a href="http://www.hostkey.ru/">HOSTKEY</a> is the official retail partner of DataPro.
