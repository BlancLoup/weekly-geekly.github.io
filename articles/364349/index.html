  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Google vs. MPAA: the beginning and continuation of the story</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  For some reason, the habr community has bypassed the news that on October 20, Google launched a new algorithm that allows for a much more active and radical reduction of sites with pirated content in search results.  And although Google has worked in this direction before, since 2012, now for the first time it has become really noticeable.  So, the vast majority of torrent trackers and sites with direct links to books, movies and everything else, it became almost impossible to find in the search results even for specific queries like ‚Äúsmth download‚Äù or ‚Äúsmth torrent‚Äù.  However, the behavior of Google, which for the first time made such serious concessions to anti-piracy companies, not only did not reassure the rights holders, but on the contrary, even more aggravated them.  Just a week after the announcement of the new algorithm, 11,668,660 new addresses were received in the database of deletion requests. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c2f/ec1/1f6/c2fec11f6214a39a53bb7ad9d8746b89.png" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I personally want to add that the frequent cases when I could not find the information of interest to me in Google even on the 3rd - 4th page of the issue, forced me to install <a href="http://duckduckgo.com/">duckduckgo.com</a> by default.  And I think many have done this way, at least from those who even understood what had happened.  From my own experience I will say that it was quite difficult to move away from the usual paradigm ‚Äúif something cannot be found in Google, it means that there is none at all‚Äù.  Thus, Google arranged for itself some outflow of traffic to other search engines that did not practice similar methods of filtering the issue. <br><br>  And yesterday, finally, the first positive news appeared in this whole story.  The last couple of months, Google has done everything to ‚Äúappease‚Äù the MPAA (American Film Association) - deleting 10 million records every week, and very quickly - within a few hours.  But no matter how you customize Google your algorithms, greedy copyright holders will still be few.  For many years, the association of film companies has increased its pressure on Google, and each time it announced new changes - MPAA (and the RIAA, the association of record labels) immediately told the press that much more could have been done.  However, this time, after such an extensive work on pirated pages, Google expected a more cordial welcome.  But, alas, wrong again.  MPAA in its press release spoke about the search engine and its work as follows:

        <ins class="adsbygoogle"

          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      ‚ÄúEach of us is responsible for helping to stop illegal online behavior, and we‚Äôre excited to see that Google recognizes its role in facilitating access to stolen content via search.‚Äù <br><br>  No wonder Google was furious at such rudeness.  Thanks to the recent <a href="http://geektimes.ru/post/242709/">hacking of Sony</a> , which revealed, among other things, the correspondence between the companies, we find out what the search giant thinks about it: <br><br>  "[Google] conveyed that they feel that they have gone beyond what the law requires; that they climbed out of their way to please us, and in response received a caustic remark, instead of a well-deserved credit of trust." <br><br>  In response to the insult, Google clicked on the "Ignore" button.  A top manager in Google‚Äôs policy department told MPAA that his company would no longer ‚Äútalk or do business‚Äù with the film industry association.  In the future, Google will negotiate with the film companies directly, since "at least 3 of them said they were very pleased with the new search engine features."  The association also believes that Google has reacted too dramatically, and in the future problems in understanding will be solved.  Perhaps the relationship of the companies has really changed since then, since the letters were written back in October. <br><br>  From myself I will add that at the moment the most popular torrent tracker <a href="http://kickass.so/">kickasstorrents</a> is in search results as high as before.  It seems that Google search is becoming relevant again, we hope that this will continue in the future. <br><br>  Based on an <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/furious-google-ended-mpaa-antipiracy-cooperation-141212/">article on TorrentFreak</a> . <br>  More details: <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20141212/12142629419/leaked-emails-reveal-mpaa-plans-to-pay-elected-officials-to-attack-google.shtml">From the leaked correspondence, it turned out that the MPAA had planned to bribe officials to hit Google</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/364349/">https://habr.com/ru/post/364349/</a></p>
