  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What will Apple show on September 12th?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/abc/baf/a16/abcbafa16818202e7e3ef876715dd92d.jpg" alt="image"></div><br><br>  We all know perfectly well that on September 12 at 21:00 the presentation of Apple will begin.  Judging by the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/150861/">invitation</a> , which traditionally gives ‚Äúfood‚Äù for the mind, one can predict what will be presented at the presentation.  Figure 5 ... What does it mean?  iPhone 5?  Mac Pro 5?  Or maybe something else? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Today it is difficult to find a person who would never hear or see prototypes of the iPhone 5, because these ‚Äúphotos‚Äù from Chinese factories are published everywhere.  It seems that we all have already thoroughly studied it, and Apple will be difficult to surprise us, the users.  Will Tim Cook have to go on stage and say: ‚ÄúDo you think you saw him?‚Äù As was the case with Steve Jobs and the iPhone 4? <br><br>  But let's begin, perhaps, with the design of Yerba Buena - the building where the Apple engineering team will present the new product.  Surely, many have seen this picture, already decorated by Yerba Buena, but what can mean stretched icons? 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
    <div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7c3/1a1/fc0/7c31a1fc02555a7961f289031ceca818.jpg" alt="image"></div><br><br>  Immediately it is clear that not all the icons are included in the design of the building.  And, if you correlate the list of changes in iOS 6.0, then you will notice that the most significant updates were received by these programs: music, Game Center, iTunes.  In addition, we note that the upcoming event is exactly musical, as it has been in recent years.  But one icon remains unidentified ... Is this a new application from Apple?  No matter how!  There are 2 logical assumptions: Ping music social network or separate ‚ÄúPodcasts‚Äù.  Both services are not popular enough, but their reincarnation in iOS can perfectly reflect on the status in general. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/877/1d0/9f8/8771d09f82833ae48224ac082914ea69.jpg" alt="image"></div><br><br>  You can also expect an increase in countries that support the iTunes Store.  For example, according to Vedomosti newspaper, a music store can be opened in Russia already in the first quarter of 2013.  It is unlikely that Apple will add only the Russian Federation, because in the same China, this market segment is not yet occupied by a company from Cupertino. <br><br><h4>  iPhone 5 and iPod </h4><br>  The number of renderers on the Web of the new iPhone has long passed all reasonable limits, and especially enterprising Chinese are stamping and selling the corps of the ‚Äúfuture novelty‚Äù.  But what do we know about the update? <br><br>  All as one insist that the screen will be increased in length, but not in width.  And let's remember how many sets of graphics you need to do by developing your application for iOS?  iPhone (Retina), iPhone (non-Retina), iPad (Retina), iPad (non-Retina).  Total - 4 + 1.  Well, if you have a program, but how to be igro-affairs?  After all, most of the graphic elements need to be redrawn in accordance with several standards!  And if the proportions of the pictures do not change with existing gadgets, then for the new iPhone it will be necessary to completely redo the graphics, paying particular attention to the aspect ratios.  But, judging by the Apple banners used in the design of the facade of Yerba Buena, this rumor is confirmed. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c63/a37/a68/c63a37a6836370009ca264062278e171.jpg" alt="image"></div><br><br>  The reduced port is a logical development of the 30-pin connector.  Apple has been creating software for a couple of years aimed at transferring everything and everyone to the "air".  If the company decided to change the port a couple of years ago, say, with the iPhone 4, then absolutely all audio and video accessories that required both speed and quality of transmission would crash.  Today, most manufacturers of accessories offer adapters or products in which you can transfer data "over the air." <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7b5/8a9/5c6/7b58a95c690354ae0a12fa29c27c4c42.jpg" alt="image"></div><br><br>  Of course, it is impossible not to take into account all these good words that will be heard on the stage, about the battery.  Yes, it will be increased!  But the term of its work will not change - ‚ÄúThank you‚Äù, an enlarged display.  Apple will surely update the graphics chip as well, as they have been promoting it quite seriously in recent years. <br><br>  In general, that's all.  We have not forgotten the NFC technology, but even if they embed this "chip" in the iPhone, then in Russia (and even more so in other countries of the former CIS) it is unlikely to be useful for the next 3-5 years.  Want a revolution?  No, you will not get it.  But despite this, we can expect huge queues before the start of sales with avid "fanatics" at the door.  Well, or just media workers. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/de9/124/324/de9124324d9a68b06231bbfbf2594aa4.jpg" alt="image"></div><br><br>  iPod touch will traditionally receive all the "chips" of the new iPhone, but it still will not have a phone, which is logical.  IPod shuffle and nano can get a small update.  Most likely, they will be left on the ‚ÄúOne more thing‚Äù, presenting small improvements to the batteries and adding a camera.  It is quite possible the emergence of USB 3.0 in all updates, which allows you to quickly transfer data over a long distance. <br><br><h4>  iPad mini </h4><br>  Immediately after the presentation of the original iPad, I had a ‚ÄúWOW‚Äù effect, and I really, as they say, ‚Äúcaught fire‚Äù with it.  After several days of careful reflection, mixed with emotions, I bought it, but did not understand why I needed it.  Need - and that's it!  But today I am very ‚Äúfriends‚Äù with him and can not even imagine how I lived without him.  And I am sure that there are thousands of such stories.  So here: I have no idea why I need an iPad mini, but also I am sure that it will be mine. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/43b/5f0/1ac/43b5f01ac2d99e49437b12da26e05b66.jpg" alt="image"></div><br><br>  According to numerous rumors from the Middle Kingdom and from ‚Äúreliable insiders to Apple,‚Äù very soon we will have to read the mail, staring at the 7.85-inch display.  The expected cost is something around 250-300-350 US dollars. <br><br>  Will Apple release a competitor to itself?  It seems to me that we cannot see such a format of the tablet for at least another year.  Cheap contradicts the policy of the company from Cupertino.  We are specially brought up to pay a tidy sum, because for it we get a premium product (which became massive a couple of years ago). <br><br><h4>  Mac computers </h4><br>  You can talk about the Mac line-up for a long time, but let's not do it - let's briefly go over possible updates.  Hardly anyone doubts that the Retina MacBook Pro will be available in a reduced size.  By collecting revenue from the TOP line, Apple, according to the laws of business, can safely embed a ‚Äúgorgeous‚Äù display in a smaller diagonal - 13 ‚Äù.  Enough of this change is for the users to ‚Äúsqueak‚Äù from pleasure, carrying their greenbacks to the company‚Äôs moneybox.  But Apple still has a new smaller MagSafe 2 in stock, which can now (and should) be built into the rest of the laptops, making them a little thinner. <br><br>  iMac received the previous update in May 2011, but, frankly, it's hard to call it an update ... Let me remind you that just over a year ago Apple decided to add a FaceTime camera and Thunderbolt ports to monoblocks.  And their design has not changed since October 2009!  Looking forward to redesign, gentlemen?  It's time, it's time! <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://images.apple.com/imac/images/design_hero1.jpg" alt="image"></div><br><br>  Mac Pro, Apple‚Äôs most powerful computer, shouldn‚Äôt be updated frequently, but its term has already arrived.  This model was upgraded only in July 2010, but technology does not stand still, so it is already quite obsolete.  Of course, it is worth updating it and leaving it for another couple of years in the best condition, after all, there should be loyalty to the ‚Äúmachine‚Äù buyer for $ 3000. <br><br>  But it is likely that a computer presentation will be held separately from the iPhone.  Still, these 2 important topics should not be mixed together, and history shows that the more presentations, the more expensive the stock price. <br><br><h4>  Broadcast </h4><br>  We will know all the updates to the full in the evening of the twelfth.  You can read the text translation of the presentation in a <a href="http://www.planetiphone.ru/live/page40304.php">special section ‚ÄúPlanets iPhone‚Äù</a> . <br><br>  But the most important thing is that now we will have a <a href="http://www.planetiphone.ru/live/video/">video broadcast</a> .  Our presenters will tell you in detail about all the updates in Russian, translate the news and show the photos live.  To see our video broadcast, you need to go to a <a href="http://www.planetiphone.ru/live/video/">special section</a> .  Start is scheduled for 20:45, come - it will be hot! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/151291/">https://habr.com/ru/post/151291/</a></p>
