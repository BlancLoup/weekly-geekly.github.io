The need of such objects for monitoring is so impressive and diverse, while the composition of the equipment of such an object that needs monitoring is so unpredictable and variable that for this purpose we had to develop the most functional controller from our nomenclature - <a href="http://ttronics.ru/%3Fmenu%3Dnews260">KUB-BS</a> . <br><br>  Perhaps its use is not limited to these objects, and perhaps our dear readers, on the basis of the following, can tell us this ...

    <h2>  <font color="5A5A5A">"Philosophy" KUB-BS</font> </h2><br><br>  So, the main difficulty in monitoring objects such as containers is that containers contain an extremely diverse "stuffing": many types and types of electricity meters, air conditioners, diesel generator sets and other equipment, and there is no talk of interface and device device unification. <br>  There are two traditional ways out of this situation: the first (unreal) is a software docking of ‚Äúall with all‚Äù, which is very expensive and time consuming;  the second (also unreal) - replacement of equipment at all facilities (electric power plant, diesel power plant, etc.) with the same type, which is even more expensive and longer. <br><br>  We offer the third option - to provide our KUB-BS controller with the ability to control everything and control everything, without relying on the ‚Äúintelligence‚Äù of the monitored devices.  This is the only cheap and fast way to get a unified system for monitoring and managing container-type communication facilities, which have a zoo of various types of equipment.  Moreover, our approach allows us not to be afraid of further replacing one type of equipment with another - it will be possible to monitor it by switching the input of the KUB-BS controller to another. <br>  And now in more detail about the formulation of the problem, namely, the initial data that guided us in the development of this device. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  <font color="5A5A5A">Task setting for the development of KUB-BS</font> </h2><br><br>  So, from our point of view, a base station or a climate cabinet consists of telecommunication equipment and life support systems for this equipment. <br><br>  The composition of these systems include: <br><ul><li>  <strong>Electro-converting installation (EPU):</strong> in terms of including in the monitoring system, it can have either discrete alarm outputs ‚Äúdry contact‚Äù and discrete control inputs, or a controller with an RS485 interface interface, or the same controller with an SNMP adapter connected to an Ethernet SPD . </li><li>  <strong>Rechargeable batteries (AKB):</strong> do not have any standard monitoring devices and the issues of monitoring their performance are entirely assigned to our object controller. </li><li>  <strong>Diesel generator set (DGU):</strong> in the plan of interest to us, is similar to the EPU.  It can also have either dry contact discrete alarm outputs and discrete control inputs, or a controller with an RS485 interface interface, or the same controller with an SNMP adapter connected to an Ethernet SPD. </li><li>  <strong>A modern electricity metering device</strong> (meter) almost certainly has an RS485 interface. </li><li>  <strong>The</strong> air conditioning <strong>unit</strong> can be either a pair of domestic air conditioners that are not equipped with any automation, or a modern split system with an SNMP adapter.  In the first case, all questions of performance monitoring and control are assigned to the controller.  In the second case, it is only necessary to provide communication between the ‚Äúsmart‚Äù climate instrument and its own software running in the Dispatch Center. </li><li>  <strong>The fire alarm subsystem</strong> may either be completely absent from the facility initially, and then it must be created on the basis of our controller, or it, on the contrary, is fully mounted on the basis of some control panel and the role of the monitoring system is reduced only to transmission to the center of signals of the monitoring station "security", "fire" and "alarm" (these are, as a rule, dry contacts). </li></ul><br>  An object controller can equally be: <br><ul><li>  a variety of dry contact inputs, temperature sensors, fire and security detectors, access authorization elements, output relays, etc .; </li><li>  multichannel interface converter RS485 to Ethernet; </li><li>  a switchboard or router providing the organization of a local area network in which various intelligent devices are included (EPU, DGU, split system, etc.) and the connection of this network to the center through a single dedicated IP address. </li></ul><br>  Add to this the most different positions of future customers in terms of allocating a communication channel: ‚ÄúEthernet only‚Äù;  ‚ÄúEthernet main channel, and GSM backup channel‚Äù, ‚ÄúGSM only‚Äù.  And finally, this key slogan of modernity is ‚ÄúSNMP, SNMP everywhere SNMP !!!‚Äù. <br><br>  Agree, the described initial conditions make the task of creating a single controller that satisfies all requirements almost unrealistic.  But we tried to cope with this task by creating a KUB-BS controller.  And this attempt seems to be a success!  Judge for yourself‚Ä¶ <br><br><h2>  <font color="5A5A5A">Functional KUB-BS</font> </h2><br><br>  The controller KUB-BS provides the following blocks: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/319/e77/1b7/319e771b70eb866d40e101b91b8596be.png"></div><br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/dd2/820/1c7/dd28201c75e99d38d829022df236d1e5.png"></div><br><br>  <strong>Fig.</strong>  <strong>1, 2.</strong> Inputs-outputs of the controller KUB-BS <br><br><ul><li>  <strong>Security and fire alarm system</strong> - arming / disarming, door opening control, access authorization, electric lock control, light and sound indication that the object is guarded, security alarm system, fire alarm system. </li><li>  <strong>2 outputs of the monitoring station</strong> (central monitoring <strong>station</strong> ) - issuing a signal to third-party security and fire equipment. </li><li>  <strong>The air conditioning unit and the control of temperature and humidity conditions</strong> - measurement of the average temperature in the room, measurement of temperatures in the output air flow of each of the two air conditioners, recording the operating time for each air conditioner separately, automatic rotation of air conditioners.  If necessary, it is possible to measure the relative humidity indoors. </li></ul><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f08/d54/d1b/f08d54d1b63efb242a68a71b08e4bf78.png"></div><br><br>  <strong>Fig.</strong>  <strong>3.</strong> Connection diagram of air conditioners <br><br><ul><li>  <strong>Power supply control unit</strong> - measurement of voltages and currents in three phases, measurement of the power supply frequency, measurement of accumulated active and reactive energy by the sum of the phases. </li><li>  <strong>Secondary power control unit</strong> - for monitoring the symmetry of batteries, measuring temperature, voltage and charge / discharge current of batteries. </li><li>  <strong>The monitoring unit of ‚Äúintelligent installations‚Äù</strong> - 3 ‚Äúend-to-end‚Äù RS485 / RS232 ports for connecting intelligent equipment (intelligent diesel power plants, electric power units, electricity meters, etc.) and transmitting data to the standard software of this equipment. </li><li>  <strong>The monitoring unit of the ‚Äúnon-intelligent‚Äù DGU</strong> - control of alarms from the DGU (via the ‚Äúdry contact‚Äù inputs), control (start) of the DGI (via the built-in relay). </li><li>  <strong>4 discrete ports</strong> - ports can be configured as ‚Äúdry contact‚Äù inputs for connecting sensors for opening, water leakage, etc., as well as control outputs for turning on / off / rebooting equipment. </li><li>  <strong>8 inputs ‚Äúdry contact‚Äù</strong> - connection of sensors for opening, water leakage, etc. </li><li>  <strong>6 power relays</strong> - control of various equipment.  Of these: 2 relays can be used to rotate air conditioners, 1 relay to start a diesel generator set, 1 relay to control an electric lock. </li></ul><br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/33c/3c1/507/33c3c15075818db0c68d3da35789d30e.png"></div><br><br>  <strong>Fig.</strong>  <strong>4. The</strong> functionality of the controller KUB-BS <br><br><h2>  <font color="5A5A5A">KUB-BS: constructive, communication channels, software</font> </h2><br><br>  There are <strong>two options for powering the</strong> controller: from 36..72V DC with measuring the value of station power, as well as power from 220V AC via a power supply unit 220V / 15V (connected to a jack connector). <br><br>  In addition, the KUB-BS controller has <strong>3 communication options with the dispatch center:</strong> communication only via the Ethernet channel, communication only via the GSM network (GPRS, SMS, CSD) or communication via Ethernet and GSM simultaneously, while Ethernet is the main communication channel and GSM - backup. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cbd/2b2/0b2/cbd2b20b2f3333c5c5e7c3b669711081.png"></div><br><br>  <strong>Fig.</strong>  <strong>5.</strong> Channels of communication KUB-BS with the center: primary and backup. <br><br>  Support for the KUB-BS controller is implemented in the software development developed by Tehnotroniks ‚Äî <a href="http://ttronics.ru/%3Fmenu%3Dcubettx">KUB-Ttkh</a> <a href="http://ttronics.ru/%3Fmenu%3Dttxsql">software</a> and <a href="http://ttronics.ru/%3Fmenu%3Dcubettx">Tekhnotroniks.SQL</a> <a href="http://ttronics.ru/%3Fmenu%3Dttxsql">software</a> . <br>  The KUB-BS controller is <strong>designed to be placed in a standard 19 ‚Äùcabinet and has a 1U case.</strong>  In addition to placement in the closet, it is also possible to wall the device. <br><br>  The functionality of KUB-BS can be expanded by connecting to the controller <a href="http://ttronics.ru/%3Fmenu%3Dcube_piko">KUBov-Pico</a> .  This is possible thanks to the router built into the CUB-BS, which allows you to organize 4 additional Ethernet connections. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/75b/257/5c3/75b2575c37fe22b26df988c285d8d612.png"></div><br><br><h2>  <font color="5A5A5A">How much is?</font> </h2><br><br>  We produce KUB-BS in various configurations, depending on the needs of the customer.  <b>KUB-BS in the minimum configuration costs 9700 p.</b>  <b>with VAT</b> (only Ethernet, 12 V power supply, without a router and sensors).
