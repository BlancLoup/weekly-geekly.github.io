After all, as the Universe expands, the farther from us is the galaxy, the greater its escape rate. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/fd8/6c3/40a/fd86c340af8f181962ae909a506a9183.jpg"><br><br>  Moreover, since the expansion is also accelerating, the galaxies fly away faster and faster from us.  Hence, it is not surprising that the light of the fleeing galaxies shifts to the red part of the spectrum. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/490/530/d9f/490530d9fcf0f1b7654184511a84c681.jpg">

      And there is nothing strange about it.  If an object moves in your direction and emits light, its wave shrinks and the light appears bluer.  If the object moves away from you, the wavelength increases and the light appears more red.  And the faster the light source moves, the stronger the wavelength shift. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4ca/5b3/074/4ca5b3074847fa8b8507a4c6a54aa0e1.jpg"><br><br>  But think about it - if an object moves from you faster and faster, will we not see objects approaching the speed of light at some point? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/97b/cff/f91/97bcfff916410536608b3454c674ce4e.jpg"><br><br>  As you know, when approaching the speed of light, many things happen: and here are the two most counterintuitive phenomena related to the special theory of relativity. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1c0/90f/122/1c090f122e3e7980a98dd4b64a705649.gif"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/531/1ef/daf/5311efdafbe641ecf064fb678f3e97c4.gif"><br><br>  If you are resting, and the object is moving relative to you at a speed that is significant compared to light speed, you will notice two very strange effects: its length will decrease in the direction of its movement, and time will slow down.  And, of course, you will immediately be interested in the question - are these effects observed in distant galaxies! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/200/571/0cf/2005710cf60cc8b94562619c6696cce1.jpg"><br><br>  Length reduction cannot be measured, since we can measure length only in the direction perpendicular to the line of sight, and the expansion occurs parallel to it.  What about time dilation?  Is it or not?  Let's think about what we can expect based on the predictions of the theory. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/cd7/90e/0d5/cd790e0d57731f798a434b8a40e9b13c.jpg"><br><br>  The studied galaxy does not move with relativistic velocities relative to objects located in its local spacetime.  There is an expansion of the space between us and a distant galaxy.  It is this expansion that increases the photon wavelengths, which makes the light look redder. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d84/488/ed6/d84488ed6efc95c1c57ddeabab6ab45e.jpg"><br><br>  But when the light was emitted, the time from the peak to the peak of each wave was much less than the time that you can observe when these peaks reach you.  So although the observed galaxy does not physically move at a relativistic speed, you should see a time dilation.  So can you do it?  What will you look for? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bd9/ee0/667/bd9ee0667d7e84f97ebbaf2900d91fad.jpg"><br><br>  For example, it is known that spiral galaxies rotate.  You may ask if it is possible to see a slowdown in their rotation.  Unfortunately, in the past, the connection between the brightness of a galaxy and its rotational speed <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2597%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D1%258C_%25D0%25A2%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8_%25E2%2580%2594_%25D0%25A4%25D0%25B8%25D1%2588%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0">in the past was not the same</a> as it is now, as spiral galaxies <a href="">evolve with time</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e22/7f3/54a/e227f354a7b52ef0b6e839491be09567.jpg"><br><br>  You may decide to monitor the quasars, as these are very bright objects that can <a href="http://iopscience.iop.org/1538-4357/553/2/L97/fulltext">be</a> clearly <a href="http://iopscience.iop.org/1538-4357/553/2/L97/fulltext">seen at long distances</a> .  However, the environment in which they are located, and the sources of variable characteristics (for example, <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/bib_query%3Fbibcode%3D1996MNRAS.278..787H">gravitational microlensing</a> ), differ in the distant and quasars closer to us. <br><br>  <a href="http://aas.aanda.org/index.php%3Foption%3Dcom_article%26access%3Dstandard%26Itemid%3D129%26url%3D/articles/aas/pdf/1999/15/r21.pdf">Another</a> <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9807113">candidate</a> is <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2593%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0-%25D0%25B2%25D1%2581%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA">gamma-ray bursts</a> , they can be seen over long distances.  But we would come up with a very well-studied class of objects with properties that do not change over time, which can be observed with a strong redshift.  If we can measure the time dilation they have, this will be the final test of the theory! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/aec/370/6d2/aec3706d2b928183ba0d55d1f4f14d83.jpg"><br><br>  <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/280898/">Supernova type Ia</a> !  These objects have a very well studied timeline, according to which they become brighter, fade out and disappear. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/49b/ef1/cdd/49bef1cdd5240750a80a0fc211ae9702.gif"><br><br>  So, if we find a remote supernova with a strong redshift, its light curve should be stretched along the time scale.  What happens in reality?  Are there any such supernovae? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c53/43a/3ba/c5343a3bae10f207c78318902630600c.jpg"><br><br>  Believe it or not, believe it or not, but there are plenty of such people!  The first - the supernova, moving away from us at a speed of almost 50% of the speed of light - <a href="http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/astro-ph/9605134">appeared in 1996</a> !  Then <a href="http://iopscience.iop.org/1538-4357/626/1/L11/19414.text.html">another one</a> , and another, and today we have a <a href="http://www.citebase.org/abstract%3Fid%3Doai%253AarXiv.org%253A0804.3595">whole crowd of them</a> , and we definitely see a time dilation in these distant galaxies! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/86e/77a/c14/86e77ac14f64aff96619001900990e14.gif"><br><br>  Red line - prediction without slowing down, blue line - with slowing down.  So this is actually happening! <br><br>  What is surprising is the presence of an observer in such a galaxy with a very powerful telescope capable of seeing us, we will already seem to him slowed down while they move at a normal speed for them! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6b7/58a/2a3/6b758a2a3d147aa996a5d91f6be8d559.jpg"><br><br>  So, watching very distant objects, you not only see them in the past, distant by billions of years, you see them in slow motion!  And while you are thinking about it, know that someone in the billions of light years from us can see how you are thinking about it for much longer! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/399605/">https://habr.com/ru/post/399605/</a></p>
