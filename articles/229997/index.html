  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Project Management Books</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><h5>  We continue to publish useful literature, this time I have prepared for you a short article on books on project management.  Dry theory or lively, bright, fascinating style of narration - which of these is closer to you?  But what if you describe the basic principles of working in the IT sphere in an exciting style, creating a practical adventure novel, where programmers play the role of main characters? </h5><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Open any of the books of the tandem DeMarko-Lister, these two just surprised.  You can begin to get acquainted with their work with the book <a href="">‚ÄúThe Human Factor: Successful Projects and Teams‚Äù</a> , which will make you look at the planning of software development, taking into account interpersonal relationships.  In fact, it is a collection of valuable tips.  Some recommendations may have sounded before, but only with Tom DeMarco and Tim Lister, every piece of advice is accompanied by a fascinating story.  You get not only the answer to the question "how", but also a comprehensive explanation of "why" and "why."  Moreover, the story is so fascinating that you do not notice how you laugh at funny situations, and immediately remember your own subordinates. <br><br>  With the staff figured out, now about the risks ... By the way, have you tried Waltzing with the Bears?  Doesn't work, does it?  So, avoiding the risks, too, will not work, you need to get ready for them and learn how to reflect and even prevent competitors from hitting.  Bring insolent to complete confusion, and even rabies, you can using the techniques of the book <a href="">"Waltzing with the Bears</a> . <a href="">"</a>  Gradually, you will master this sophisticated art. <br><br>  Best-selling author, business coach and just a successful businessman Patrick Lensioni, deciding to share his unique experience, did not want to follow the path of many of his colleagues and create a monotonous list of moral teachings.  But parables are fun, funny and informative.  His business fiction <a href="">book, The Five Temptations of a Manager,</a> will show you himself from the side.  Believe me, this is a bit sobering, some of his short plots can become for you a real "ice shower".  But subordinates can also praise, but reasonable criticism, and even with a detailed description of how to act more effectively, will have to be by the way of any of us.  Lension has a lot of books, and each of them is almost worth its weight for a project manager.  For example, ‚ÄúThree signs of dismal work: A story with meaning for managers (and their subordinates)‚Äù is a novel about how to light a fire in the eyes of a team, motivate them to do their work with passion, joy, and genuinely root for the result.
