Due to the fact that this topic is becoming more relevant every year, I think it will be interesting to read what famous fiction writers thought about it.  In most books, artificial intelligence is presented in the form of humanoid robots.  Although the era of robots has already come (though without AI), we do not see these humanoid robots on the streets, due to the fact that they are not needed.  Now all robots are narrowly specialized, and have a specific design and purpose.  And human-like robots serve mainly for entertainment.  But it still does not overshadow the greatness of the fantastic worlds of the future of our favorite science fiction.  I hope you find something interesting for yourself from this list. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><hr><br><h3>  "Hyperion's Songs", Dan Simmons </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/13a/7b2/f5e/13a7b2f5e31b4ccb83094fb35c652cf7.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Against the background of the beginning of the interstellar war of humanity with the IskIns and mutants, seven pilgrims headed for the anomalous Tombs of Time on the planet Hyperion.  Their campaign is the very minimum impact that can have an impact on the fate of humanity.  But how, neither they nor those who sent them know.  Six of them tell their stories, to one degree or another associated with the merciless mechanical monster Shrike, who came from the future.

      Undoubtedly one of the best novels in science fiction, which received dozens of awards and prizes, including ‚ÄúHugo‚Äù.  The author managed to tie together a huge number of storylines, write different parts of his novels in a completely different stylistic and artistic manner and at the same time show their knowledge both as a literary scholar and as a person who is well versed in astrophysics, cosmology, cybernetics, history, religion.  About artificial intelligence in the novel is everything: the history of creation, development over the centuries, a complex internal structure, and a strange attitude towards the creators. <br><br><hr><br><h3>  "The Moon is a Harsh Mistress," Robert Heinlein </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/88c/159/958/88c159958c574495acda6764db1098af.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In the future, the Moon is transformed into a raw material appendage of the Earth.  Receiving mere pennies and having an unbearable condition for the existence of the lunar inhabitants decide how to teach the crawling earthlings.  On the side of the rebels gets a supercomputer of enormous power, possessing, moreover, a real soul and an excellent sense of humor. <br><br>  The novel tells about the supercomputer Mike, named after Mycroft Holmes, who unexpectedly gains intelligence, after which he becomes the head of the uprising of the inhabitants of the moon against the dictates of the Earth.  As for me, the originality of this work lies in the fact that here artificial intelligence arranges revolutions not of machines, but of people, and this is a rather rare development of a script for science fiction. <br><br><hr><br><h3>  ‚ÄúI, Robot‚Äù, Isaac Asimov </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/232/81d/ed9/23281ded9cc241b3b330f5a213f87bea.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  Collection of science fiction stories, had a great influence on modern science fiction literature.  In this collection, the first three laws of robotics were formulated. <br><br>  Humanity has created robots - faithful servants and reliable support in future achievements.  But the new mind, too, is looking for answers to eternal questions, and sometimes it does altogether enter into arguments with the creators.  How does this turn out for people and each person individually? <br><br>  Definitely a classic.  The basis for hundreds and hundreds of stories about robots.  The general idea uniting the stories of the collection is the resolution of problems associated with robots, which can be attributed to the clash of iron logic of the laws of robotics and the human factor.  And of course, the basis of the whole cycle, these are the three laws of robotics, which are presented in each of the stories from a different angle.  And the relevance of these laws, as well as their enforcement, will grow in the future along with the progress in the creation of artificial intelligence. <br><br><hr><br><h3>  ‚ÄúDo Androids Dream About Electricians?‚Äù Philip Dick </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/900/c9d/c69/900c9dc697274adfaa54736f67a0eba2.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  After a nuclear war, the Earth became a scorched, dying desert.  Most people left Earth and moved to other colonized planets of the solar system.  The people who remained on Earth eke out a miserable, dreary existence in the cities, which are also dying out.  One of these people - Rick Descartes - a professional hunter androids.  Rick gets the task to track down and destroy several runaway androids who illegally arrived on Earth.  But during the hunt, he involuntarily has doubts.  Rick asks a question - is it humane, to destroy androids? <br><br>  In the novel, the man and the android are opposed to each other.  The border between the living and the artificial is in the capacity for empathy, and people are struggling to prove to each other and to themselves that they have this ability.  The author shows that in this dark world, the complete alienation of people from each other destroys this boundary, and the difference between man and android is becoming less and less. <br><br><hr><br><h3>  "Positron Man", Isaac Asimov </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f72/f7e/fe4/f72f7efe411840e6b4eff033aa6f960e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The novel is written based on a small story by Azimov ‚ÄúThe Bicentennial Man‚Äù. <br><br>  The Martin family, having acquired the Andrew robot, soon discovers his outstanding creativity abilities.  After some time, Andrew begins to sell his work, giving back part of the profits of the Martin family.  He gets a bank account, he provides himself, but this is not enough ... Andrew wants to be free.  He goes through the whole process of humanization, wants to feel what is almost the main component of human life: love.  After all, this is the most important stage of becoming a man.  Andrew is willing to trade his immortality for it. <br><br><hr><br><h3>  "Kiberiada", Stanislav Lem </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d0b/284/0d6/d0b2840d6c6f4bb9aca8edd8a8ada551.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Civilization robots.  It has its own laws, its own taboos.  The worlds of robots are inhabited by amazing characters who have only a remote idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe race of people, but at the same time their problems are so similar to human ones.  But the robots take their decision in their own way.  Everything should be rational and optimal, as cybernetics dictates - a kind of religion of the world of Cyberyad. <br><br>  The story of the future stylized fairy tales.  Subtle, elegant and original humor is perfectly combined with a deep meaning, which from the first perusal sometimes fails to catch.  The problems raised are truly global, however they are presented in a light and easy way.  Truly great and limitless fantasy of Stanislav Lem. <br><br>  And the content: funny, interesting, and most importantly, instructive.  The tales of robots, like all tales, serve not only for entertainment, but also carry a hidden meaning. <br><br><hr><br><h3>  "2001: A Space Odyssey", Arthur Clark </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9bb/de3/599/9bbde3599dac4d24a3b5490aec6c3116.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Who are we?  What place do we occupy in the universe?  These questions are before the heroes of the novel.  The crew of the S.S. Discovery spacecraft ‚Äî Captains Dave Bowman, Frank Poole, and their HEL-9000 on-board computer ‚Äî must explore Jupiter and see why aliens are watching Earth.  On this way, many unexpected discoveries await them ... <br><br>  It is interesting and fascinating to read even everyday things related to space flight.  Not to mention the rebellion of artificial intelligence, contact with the highest incomprehensible in its strength and ends of the mind. <br><br><hr><br><h3>  "Robots of the Apocalypse", Daniel Wilson </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/38f/cce/b17/38fcceb170db41d7a8df70610d6e7059.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Having grown experimental artificial intelligence, people released a genie from a bottle.  Realizing himself AI took control of robots and other equipment and declared war on humanity.  Will mankind be able to withstand a new threat or will it be swept away from the face of the earth? <br><br>  The author managed to invent, perhaps, the most likely scenario of the revolution, without the instant destruction of all people and himself with nuclear weapons, with the subsequent appearance of someone who invented and assembled super humanoid robots and other incredible machines. <br><br><hr><br><h3>  Neuromant, William Gibson </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bb3/ff5/8be/bb3ff58be34d4fc99a186b4a33188123.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The world of the near future is permeated with virtual space, and human flesh is completely hewn by high-tech devices.  Huge megacities covered the surface of the Earth, and giant corporations mercilessly fighting each other with all available methods. <br><br>  The book has received a number of prestigious literary awards and is considered one of the best in the cyberpunk genre.  In this work, such concepts as artificial intelligence, virtual reality, genetic engineering, transnational corporations, and cyberspace were considered long before these concepts became popular in popular culture. <br><br><hr><br><h3>  ‚ÄúHitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy‚Äù, Douglas Adams </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/170/969/344/1709693445e6481280c23761b174c65f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  One day, huge alien spaceships were hanging over the Earth, and people were told that their home planet was to be demolished, and in its place a luxurious interstellar highway would be laid.  In general, humanity was not lucky.  In addition to the very ordinary guy named Arthur Dent, an old friend and drinking companion of whom Ford Prefect turned out to be an alien! <br><br>  What does artificial intelligence, you ask?  How can you not remember the depressive robot Marvin, who, due to constant movements in time, has become thirty-seven times older than the Universe.  But what about a supercomputer that, for seven and a half million years, was looking for an answer to the main question of life, the Universe and all that?  But what about a computer the size of a planet that the Question itself should have found?  Classic, which probably every fan of fiction has already read.  All the rest must be read. <br><br><hr><br>  Of course, this is not all great works on artificial intelligence.  But my goal was to collect the top ten in my opinion, from those that I read, so write in the comments your favorite books on this topic that are not included in this list. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/390645/">https://habr.com/ru/post/390645/</a></p>
