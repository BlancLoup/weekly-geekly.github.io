They began to come at times more active than before.  The next step in terms of <s>world domination of</s> increasing convenience was ‚Äúnot to change anything, but to make the life of users more visual‚Äù <br><br>  That is exactly what happened today.  Previously, the standard page of each user looked like a dull incomprehensible thing.  Now, there is a brief presentation of the data that were accumulated for a long time in our bottomless database clusters and were not visible to anyone. <br><br> <a href="http://www.afisha.ru/personalpage/191661/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/cd1/feb/e5b/cd1febe5b3667051a8b7c1fc06aa7438.png" width="498" height="118"></a>

      Here there are fresh impressions, a new review, and what the user considers the best of all places and works.  Places immediately marked on the Google map.  Activity in forums also pops up.  User ratings and preferences - in full view.  "Poster" remembers what you liked, and what is not, what you wrote reviews, and that it does not deserve even a two-star rating.  "Poster" now not only remembers, but also helps you to tell others about your impressions. <br><br>  But this is only part of the change. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The second important change was the ratings for reviews.  We were tormented and not allowed to sleep at night thinking that the best reviews of those users who went to the movie among the first were buried forever under all those ‚Äúso-so‚Äù -speeches that appeared later.  In addition, some reviews themselves are masterpieces - it's a shame no one will see them. <br><br>  So there were reviews reviews.  After a short, months-long discussion, we drew sketches, and today they have become living buttons on the site, the meaning of which is in the title: did you see a good review?  Say thank you! <br><br> <a href="http://www.afisha.ru/movie/180362/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/c26/0f8/1a1/c260f81a15a9f615e04300b89db04e7a.png" width="498" height="73"></a> <br><br>  The beauty is that everyone wins: the author of the review receives feedback, readers can see the very thing right on the page of any movie, club or restaurant.  And this allows us not only to bring up the opinions of observers of the ‚ÄúBillboard‚Äù itself, but also to give an alternative view.  That's what's happening on the page of the movie "12": <br><br> <a href="http://www.afisha.ru/movie/180137/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/73f/56a/f8f/73f56af8ff00764bf3dbad749ff7d6ae.png" width="498" height="230"></a> <br><br>  The resulting ‚ÄúThank you‚Äù and their attitude to the number of reviews is a good way to understand what kind of user is in front of you, and how much you can write.  Therefore, now each review, except the author‚Äôs name, displays his userpic (it is much easier to distinguish users this way) and the number of ‚Äúthanks‚Äù and reviews.  The number is rather an indicator of the maturity and experience of the user.  And it‚Äôs not at all what it is worth competing for, although there will certainly be review enthusiasts who write reviews on everything that happens, roll or play. <br><br>  Of the other nice things - the actual map, which marked all the places that people appreciated or wrote a review.  We thought at first that this would turn into ‚Äúwalks around the city with such and such‚Äù, but suddenly it turned out that the map ideally reflects the habitat - where does this person live and where does it go, what does he like more and what does he not tolerate. <br><br> <a href="http://www.afisha.ru/personalpage/191878/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/15f/26b/80d/15f26b80d9eaee2c7daf2e8dfb3e97a2.png" width="498" height="319"></a> <br><br>  The most beautiful thing here is that the user does not need to rest against a horn and bring something somewhere specially.  This is not a new service with thousands of fields and requests, ‚Äúbut add what you think about it,‚Äù or with suggestions, ‚Äúand specify three hundred of your favorite places on the planet.‚Äù <br><br>  Everything happened and happens on its own - users put asterisks or write reviews, and Poster turns them into a slim, multi-colored, understandable picture.  No special skills for the design or organization of their impressions of the user is not required. <br><br>  The continuation of the adventure with user data follows.  In the meantime, <a href="http://www.afisha.ru/">try to see</a> which of your friends that he loves and where he goes. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/288724/">https://habr.com/ru/post/288724/</a></p>
