Is this true, and if so, what are the reasons?  Everybody can drive.  But there is no constructive view from different sides.  Let's think together what we need to invent something. <br><br>  Let's deal with this in more detail. <br><a name="habracut"></a>

        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"

      <br>
      First, let's think about what we are missing?  To start the invention you need an idea.  And I don‚Äôt just want a tablecloth, but a more realistic one for which you can formalize and present an implementation algorithm. <br><br>  Next we need funds.  Almost all (very many) inventions that required small investments were invented in the last 100 years.  So we need money.  Given that the people of science in the majority of people are not rich, then the investment will be external.  On the other hand, people who have this money there want to invest it where there is less risk and more return.  Consequently, inventors without a finished model, they pass by. <br><br>  Take an example.  Yesterday I came across a thread.  The author claims that he invented an installation that makes fuel from plastic waste.  The quality is at the level of 92 gasoline, but if you invest money the quality will be higher.  According to the author, everything works; gas goes; BUT, money is needed for certification, licensing, quality control, production of an industrial installation, and so on.  In general, we need investments. <br>  In conclusion, I will say that unfortunately he has not yet found investors, and I doubt that he will find out until he certifies himself, he will check the quality and so on. <br><br>  <a href="http://inventions.ru/post_1208796645.html">inventions.ru/post_1208796645.html</a> type description of the installation.  If necessary, I will provide a prooflink for communication with potential investors. <br><br>  <b>Conclusion1.</b>  To invent need money.  The state will not give money.  From the side of the money will come only if you give some 100% guarantee that the money will return.  And no one can give a 100% guarantee. <br><br>  Take, for example, the engineering industry.  There seems to be money there, I guess.  It seems like some improvements are made, improvements to the design.  At least periodically release new, well forgotten, models of cars. <br><br>  Take for example rotary engines.  They even put one time on vases.  The technology is promising, but it needs to be developed, and what needs to be developed is money.  And why invest, when it is not known what and when this will turn out.  Moreover, you can get money selling vases whose principles have not changed for 50 years. <br><br>  <b>Conclusion2.</b>  In our countries, even if you have money, they don‚Äôt want to invest it for a long time.  And if they will be only if there is a 100% guarantee that the money will return, and 100% guarantee to give no one can ... somewhere I already wrote it =) <br><br>  So in conclusion about the good.  The fact that we in the countries still occur inventions.  True, they are not for civilians.  Technologies for space are actively developing. Old rocket carriers are being improved. New ones are being designed.  The same situation with military technology. <br><br>  Good luck. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/77578/">https://habr.com/ru/post/77578/</a></p>
