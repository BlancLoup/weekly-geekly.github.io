Having fallen ill during the New Year holidays, I decided not to waste time, but to start exploring the Android platform.  At that time, I knew a little about it, and in Java it was not strong.  The study decided to start by writing a small game.

      <b>UPD: Can anyone comment on the price?</b>  <b>Is it a lot or a little, how much could it cost you?</b> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Then the first version of the game Letter Tower Defense was born this week.  I inserted advertising into it and waited.  As time went on, the game gained little popularity, and I did not have advertising revenue.  I tried to use different advertising providers: QuattroWireless, AdMob, Smaato, but revenues were calculated in dollars per month. <br><br>  At the same time, I issued several updates to correct errors, but this did not change the situation.  The main problem is that the game did not use NDK, and I didn‚Äôt understand the program life cycle.  Because of this, the game crashed when folding or incoming call. <br><br>  At that moment, when I understood the reasons for the main problems, the game scored about 5,000 downloads, the idea turned out to be interesting and people played.  But most complained that the game crashes, that there is no music, that there are few levels. <br><br>  In my experience, I realized how important it is to impress.  The game should first be beautiful, and only then interesting.  In the concept of beautiful, I put both design, music, and the absence of brakes, and most importantly - do not fly out. <br><br>  In April last year, when I understood all this, they wrote to me from China, with a proposal to localize the game and help with distribution in China.  I then decided to refuse and first rewrite the game, and then distribute it.  But as often happens, there was no time for it and I forgot about the game.  I changed jobs, the time was even less, and the game was already perceived as an unsuccessful attempt.  And users, nevertheless, rocked it and played.  And by 2011, she has collected more than 25,000 downloads.  This is also a bit, but as it turned out enough to pay back the development. <br><br>  And at the end of the New Year holidays I was written by the Korean company Ubinuri.  They offered to localize the game in Korean and even distribute it in Korea, because  They do not have a market.  Moreover, they offered to pay 200 evergreens for my localization work.  But I no longer wanted to bother with this game.  I have already forgotten the source codes and were not well oriented, and time has never appeared. <br><br>  And I decided to try to sell them distribution rights in Korea.  In response, I heard that it was interesting to buy them, but only in the whole world.  I agreed without hesitation.  I do not want to mess around, and I will get some money for it.  We corresponded for a long time and agreed on the amount of $ 3000.  I still can not understand how this is an adequate price.  But anyway, we signed an agreement and today I saw money in my bank account. <br><br>  Probably, this story lacks some intrigue, but there is nowhere to take it from.  I just shared the experience of selling the rights to the game, if the process of negotiations or payment is interesting, I will gladly supplement it. <br><br>  UPD: <br>  Since the first comment with a request to describe the transfer of rights and negotiations, I will tell you more. <br>  After they expressed a desire to buy the rights to the program all over the world and asked for the price.  I have been thinking about money for a long time and tried to estimate how much such a game could cost (which, I recall, has many problems of the architectural plan).  Without having come up with the evaluation criteria, I made them write my proposals, citing lack of experience.  They happily offered $ 2000 and sent a sample agreement.  Giving up courage, I asked for $ 3,000, deciding that I did not risk anything. <br>  Thinking a couple of days, they agreed to this amount. <br><br>  Transfer of rights was to sign the agreement.  I sent them a signed scan, he sent back in response to him, but with his signature.  The main points of the agreement (below I cited the text in English) were that: <br>  1. I give them the source codes and the right to change them, publish the application and anything else. <br>  2. I remove the application from all sites (including markets), where I published the application. <br>  3. I undertake not to distribute the application in the future. <br>  4. they pay me $ 3000. <br><br>  Each party has 7 days from the date of signing to fulfill its part.  I was afraid that they could deceive me (here it is the Russian mentality), so after signing, I immediately removed the application from the sites, but did not send the source codes and waited for the money.  The money was transferred to SWIFT by transfer to Unicredit Bank, where I specifically opened a currency account.  On the last day of the seven, they wrote that they sent money.  The next morning I saw them in the Internet bank and immediately sent the source. <br><br>  Unfortunately, I am not very legally literate and do not know how much such a document is valid in Russia.  Especially since I only have a scan of the document.  But in this case, I consider myself safe, because I sell, but not buy. <br><br>  Thank you I want to say to the bank, which helped to figure out what and how.  Open the necessary account, printed out all the details that I needed and explained to me what was needed. <br><br>  And here is the text of the example agreement that they sent initially. <br><br> <code>Application Transfer Agreement <br> <br> This Agreement, made and entered into as of this __th day of January, 2011 by and between Ubinuri, Inc, a corporation existing under the law of Republic of Korea having its principal address at 907 E&amp;C Venture Dream Tower 6, 197-28, Guro-dong, Guro Gu, Seoul, Korea (hereinafter referred to as ‚ÄúBuyer‚Äù) and Pr-Rm Games, a corporation duly organized and existing under the law of [ OOOOO ] and having its principal office of business at [ OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO ] (hereinafter referred to as ‚ÄúSeller‚Äù) . <br> <br> WITNESSETH: <br> <br> Whereas, the Seller is the developer and the owner of Intellectual Property Right and Publication Right of the Application set forth in the Exhibit A(hereinafter referred to as ‚ÄúApplication‚Äù). <br> <br> WHEREAS, the Buyer is willing to purchase the above Application from the Seller and the Seller is also willing to transfer the ownership of Intellectual Property Right and Copy Right of the Application to the Buyer with the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth. <br> <br> NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual premises, covenants and stipulation herein contained, both parties agree as follows: <br> <br> The Seller developed the Application on its own and the Application is the property of the Seller. <br> With the conclusion of this Agreement, the Seller shall transfer the title of the Application along with the Intellectual Property Right, Copy Right, Source Code and related technical documents of the Application to the Buyer. <br> The Seller's right on the Intellectual Property Right, Copy Right is relinquished with the conclusion of the Agreement and the Seller shall unpublish the Application from every web or mobile market place and site all over the world including Google's Android Market in seven days from the conclusion of the Agreement. <br> The Seller shall not publish or distribute any copy of the Application and agrees that the Buyer shall retain exclusive and complete control over the Application. <br> In return for the all rights and licenses, technical information transferred and provided by the Seller, the Buyer shall pay the Seller Four Hundred and Fifty US Dollars(450 USD) in seven days from the conclusion of the Agreement. <br> Payment shall be made in US Dollar by electronic transfer to Developer's bank account.
