The Japanese are always very responsible for E3 and try to show the best.  Probably the brightest of their performance was the presentation of their latest console, the PlayStation 4, which smashed the Xbox One presentation at a nearby booth in 2013. <br><br>  At this E3, such passions do not boil, but, in any case, the Sony presentation is worthy of attention.

    <h4>  PlayStation VR </h4><br>  Let's start with the hardware presented by the Japanese, namely with the PlayStation VR. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/84a/08e/b0d/84a08eb0d0b30cbf2e9fb6887118cce4.jpg" alt="image" width="800"><br>  <i>PlayStation VR</i> <br><br>  The race for the VR segment began a long time ago and after some success of the Oculus Rift, HTC joined with Valve (HTC Vive), Sony with its Playstation VR and even Facebook. <br><br>  After a few years, almost all manufacturers came to the finish line and are ready to present their products to the mass consumer.  And if Oculus and HTC Vive are focused on the PC segment and prepared users in advance for the configuration of their computer to <s>be like the wing of the plane to</s> match the latest technology, then for the PlayStation everything is much more difficult, because in hardware PS4 lost to the descopes even in power the moment of its release, not to mention the situation three years later. <br><br>  A high-quality picture in VR glasses requires iron, in fact, brute force in the form of huge computing power, first of all, the computing power of the video adapter.  And if a PC gamer can afford to make a ‚Äúsandwich‚Äù of several video cards costing $ 700‚Äì1500, then there is no place to put them in the console.  Plus, consoles have always been positioned as devices that never need an upgrade - you play N-years, and then you buy a new generation console for $ 300-500. <br><br>  Therefore, Sony, like Microsoft, had to take the path of modernization: the Japanese concern plans to release the so-called PS 4.5, an analogue developed by its competitors Project Scorpio - in fact, a more powerful version of Xbox One. <br><br>  VR technologies have created a precedent: within one generation, there will be several consoles with different performance.  Someone may not like it, however, the choice of the manufacturers was small: PS4 and Xbox One, in their original form, are simply unable to process the video stream for VR glasses and produce acceptable picture quality at the output.  And it's not about the lack of Full HD 1080p - even it is not enough for a comfortable game.  VR glasses need 4K quality. <br><br>  Anyway, the <u>PlayStation VR will go on sale on October 13 of this year at a price of $ 399 (¬£ 349)</u> , which, in fact, is the cost of the PS4 console itself.  Also, the developers <u>promise about 50 VR-compatible games</u> for PS at the time of the start of sales. <br><br>  According to the <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/explore/playstation-vr/tech-specs/">technical specifications on the PS site</a> , the headset will have a weight of 610 grams, two 5.7-inch displays with a resolution of 1920 by 1080 and a viewing angle of 100 degrees.  In addition, the kit includes the necessary USB and HDMI cables (one by one), adapters and headphones.  Also, the glasses are equipped with a three-axis gyro and accelerometer. <br><br>  But that is not all.  Sony has a painful love of home-made controllers, so they also prepared something for the PlayStation VR.  This is a special pistol controller for VR shooters, which is the successor of PlayStation Move Sharpshooter.  Called his PS VR Aim Controller: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c9d/717/2a0/c9d7172a0d9b109857cd5062ea37f563.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>PS VR Aim Controller.</i>  <i>Looks not too brutal.</i> <br><br>  <u>The exact release date and cost of this device has not yet been named.</u> <br><br><h4>  Star Wars: Battlefront X-Wing Mission </h4><br>  During the presentation of VR glasses, Sony revealed the Star Wars: Battlefront X-Wing Mission trailer. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/9JS642fmhk0%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhh72E5nCGF9vmaRdJ09VooOf_D4aw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Yes, it will be possible to fly in the new Star Wars with glasses of virtual reality.  Worked on the game studio Criterion Games and DICE (the latter is the author of Star Wars: Battlefront). <br><br>  The release of the game is scheduled for this year, after the release of the PlayStation VR. <br><br><h4>  I'm Back! </h4><br>  After <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/264306/">their retirement from Konami,</a> legendary game designer Hideo Kojima concentrated on working at his own studio, Kojima Productions, and presented his new game Death Stranding at E3 as part of Sony's presentation. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/ER07xq4Hwl4%3Ffeature%3Doembed%26start%3D64&amp;xid=25657,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhz_1o75ggG2scNvmn5in4eFykTkw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <i>Greetings Kojima and Death Stranding Trailer</i> <br><br>  Along with Hideo, the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A0%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B4%25D1%2583%25D1%2581,_%25D0%259D%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD">actor Norman Reedus</a> worked on the game, best known for the series The Walking Dead, where he played Daryl Dixon.  It was Reedus who presented his appearance to the protagonist of the Kojima game and, apparently, was actively involved in creating an image using the technology of motion capture, actually ‚Äúplaying‚Äù what was happening in the game. <br><br>  The appearance of Reedus is not accidental: earlier, even under the wing of Konami, Kojima worked with Norman and Guillermo Del Toro on a new Silent Hill, where the actor also had to become the prototype of the main character, and Del Toro - the scriptwriter.  However, Konami project turned, and after Kojima left the company. <br><br>  As it is the Japanese, the trailer is extremely mysterious, filled with symbolism and does not explain anything.  In various forums and communities, controversy has already flared up and theories have been advanced on the subject of the game‚Äôs plot.  For example, Death Stranding is dedicated to a whole <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/4nz5xt/death_stranding_e3_2016/">thread on Reddit</a> , where community members actively share opinions and insights in trying to decipher the content of the video. <br><br>  <u>The exact release date of the game has not been announced.</u> <br><br><h4>  Reprint of Crash Bandicoot </h4><br>  Crash Bandicoot is the legendary title of the American studio Naughty Dog (bought by Sony Entertament in 2001), which for two decades has been creating exclusives for the PlayStation.  The record of the team includes such games and series as Jak &amp; Daxter, Uncharted, The Last of Us and, of course, Crash Bandicoot. <br><br>  Since the release of the last Bandicoot from Naughty Dog, seventeen years have passed (Crash Team Racing, Crash Bandicoot Racing, released for the PlayStation back in 1999), after which Sony transferred work on the series to Eurocom, Traveller's Tales, Vicarious Visions, Dimps and Radical Entertainment.  Who will work on Bandicoot this time is unknown.  The rights to the game are currently owned by Activision.  Between them and Sony, an agreement was reached, thanks to which the Japanese will be able to republish the platform for PS4.  The following parts of the series will appear on the PlayStation 4: Crash Bandicoot, Crash Bandicoot 2: Cortex Strikes Back and Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/4-qpg_VP6Fs%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjFGVBJH3nw2frztmk3mEQQ3C2HdQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <i>Crash Bandicoot reissue trailer</i> <br><br>  <u>The reissue release is scheduled for October this year.</u> <br><br><h4>  New Spider-Man </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b7d/558/62a/b7d55862a6e354fd8280aadd77df3f10.jpg" alt="image" width="800"><br><br>  Marvel, unlike DC Comics, in recent years has rarely exploited the theme of its own superheroes for the release of computer games.  Plus, the situation was complicated by the fact that all rights to the hero belong to Sony Entertament, only some of them managed to be returned recently, and only that related to the film adaptation (this is why Spider-Man could appear in the film ‚ÄúCivil War‚Äù).  And now, on this E3, the studio Insomniac Games, under the patronage of Sony, unveiled a trailer for its game about one of the main characters in the Marvel Universe - Spider-Man. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/3R2uvJqWeVg%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjesfRGlwSFAiW_36RyPaKfNvC-aQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <i>Trailer for the new Spider-Man</i> <br><br>  <u>The new Spider-Man will be released exclusively for the PlayStation 4. The exact release date is unknown.</u> <br><br><h4>  God of war is back </h4><br>  Kratos will again cut the gods and titans into pieces: on the PlayStation 4 will be a continuation of the series of God of War. <br><br>  In the new part, Kratos will be old, bearded and not alone.  Crush enemies will help his little son, to train and deserve the respect that the hero of the series yearns for. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/CJ_GCPaKywg%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhghffSijygDxbjMbad7iP0MADIaEg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <i>Gameplay trailer for the new God of War</i> <br><br>  Based on this, it is clear that the plot has acquired somewhat greater depth compared to the previous parts, since the motivation of the character has changed.  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãhaving a companion child, to whom the main character - battered by life, a tough, bearded old man - feels warm, and with whom he fought side by side with the enemies, is no longer new and successfully ‚Äútook off‚Äù from Sony four years earlier: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7f8/a41/7d3/7f8a417d3c3a48c2b7b44cdb5cb59e40.png"><br>  <i>Kratos and his son in the new God of War and Joel with Ellie from The Last of Us</i> <br><br>  The characters communicate with each other, some gameplay elements and the whole atmosphere of the relationship between the hero and the child painfully remind The Last of Us that fans of the story about the adventures of Joel and Ell might like and provide God of War with solid sales. <br><br>  In addition, the image of the ‚ÄúSpartan hero‚Äù has changed: now he is more like not an ancient warrior, but a northerner-viking.  Kratos changed his swords to a more brutal ax, which, it is true, still deals with its enemies as effectively. <br><br>  <u>The exact release date of the game is unknown, exclusive for the PlayStation 4.</u> <br><br><h4>  Days goone </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2e8/988/467/2e8988467cdf66b96f6e637104e1d7f0.jpg" alt="image" width="800"><br><br>  The theme of the apocalypse is still exploited by game designers, and this time it is reflected in the work of Bend Studio and their game Days Gone. <br><br>  According to the developers, the highlight of Days Gone is an open world, that is, it is not just another igrofilm-press-x-see-cut-scene, which Sony is famous for.  The game will be dedicated to survival in the post-apocalyptic world and, according to the developers, the plot will raise issues of humanity, morality and love. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/n95IaELdWDU%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhiiuW24PBtc0_UxGqvIWWjEkQUNmg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <i>Days Gone Trailer</i> <br><br>  Also in the Days Gone will be a highly developed combat system and crafting system, which will allow you to fight a lot of different ways, ranging from hand-to-hand combat and the installation of traps.  Also in the game will be the perks system, which will allow you to choose a more suitable player style, and the open world will radically increase the options for the development of the plot. <br><br>  <u>Released unknown, exclusive for PlayStation 4.</u> <br><br><h4>  Unfinished The Last Guardian </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/184/d1a/eb8/184d1aeb87668f7c6072f948b85a1dd8.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Sony Computer Entertainment Japan has finally announced the release of its long-term construction project - The Last Guardian. <br><br>  The game was first presented to the public <b>in 2009</b> , and has been under development since 2007. And now, almost ten years later, Sony announced that the project has been completed. <br><br>  The Last Guardian - a story about the adventures of a boy in a fantasy world.  The main character tries to get out of the ruins of a huge castle and in the process meets a huge griffin-like creature with whom he makes friends. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/xXObgXnAUkw%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhg7Ld5Uc5-9a-nJfeoqM7ydlHubg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <u>The game is already available for pre-order, release October 25, 2016.</u> <br><br><h4>  Horizon zero dawn </h4><br>  Also at the presentation was announced the release date of another new product - Horizon Zero Dawn. <br><br>  This project also raises the topic of post-apocalypse, but not in the format we are used to: the action takes place much later, and machines became the cause of the collapse of civilization.  Humanity is rejected in the stone age, and robots have evolved to animal-like entities with which people are fighting. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/T5Xx3MdqdgM%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhheSsHqX4aOzAxIhZzxJ81_w0FoSw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <u>The release of the game will take place on February 28, 2017, exclusive for the PlayStation 4.</u> <br><br><h4>  Gran Turismo Sport </h4><br>  Of course, not deprived of attention and the main exclusive racing simulator for PS - Gran Turismo. <br><br>  The new part of the Gran Turismo Sport series is a logical continuation of the previous games of the series, plus the developers have relied on online battles between virtual drivers.
