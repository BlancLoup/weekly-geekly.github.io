He wanted people to understand and support his idea.  Having written this article, I would very much like to help people fulfill their desires and realize their thoughts in published articles, in blogs or just comments. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  Whether writing a large article on several pages or a small comment, you must always adhere to the rules that allow you to succeed.  Practicing and repeating the material studied will help you to further use your skills at the level of automatism. <br><br><blockquote>  <strong>1. Firmly understand the subject and the main idea of ‚Äã‚Äãyour article.</strong>  Think what thought you want to convey to the user.  Perhaps you want to indicate any problem to humanity and the ways to solve it, or it is an advertisement of your services and their difference from others. </blockquote>

    <blockquote>  <strong>2. Article should grow.</strong>  It is very difficult to write a good article from one time, which will effectively affect the user. </blockquote><br><br><blockquote>  <strong>3. Express your own thoughts and give your own examples.</strong>  Sometimes many of us spoke to the audience, stupidly reading the text from printed sheets.  It caused only a dream and nothing more.  Everyone understood that it was written by someone and all that you did was just print it on the printer.  Think about whether to present this to the user? </blockquote><br><br><blockquote>  <strong>4. Get to know a lot of material</strong> before publishing.  You should know perfectly well what you are writing about.  Users may have questions or inconsistencies.  Due to the large amount of information, you can always flash and not be deceived.  Collect much more information than you intend to use.  Then you will have a lot of material, you can choose the best one by comparing this or that information and leaving exactly what you would like to provide to the public. </blockquote><br><br><blockquote>  <strong>5. Focus on important words and subordinate to them unimportant.</strong>  There must be a contrast.  Let the user think less and add contrast to the mass of text. </blockquote><br><br><blockquote>  <strong>6. Do not rush from one question to another.</strong>  Be consistent.  The idea is like a string - if you cut it off, there will be no more music. </blockquote><br><br><blockquote>  <strong>7. Be brief.</strong>  Be extremely brief and at the same time try to fully disclose the topic that you intended to present to the user.  Sometimes it happens that not so important topics were indirectly touched upon.  The user is more likely to notice this, so I advise you to use links to third-party resources, where the user will receive more detailed information, while your text will remain readable. <br></blockquote><br><blockquote>  <strong>8. Here is one of the best schemes</strong> that will bring you success: <br>  Ã∂ volunteer interest <br>  to draw attention <br>  Ã∂ gain confidence <br>  State the facts at your disposal <br>  Ã∂ explain the positives <br></blockquote><br><br><blockquote>  <strong>9. Be individual and inimitable.</strong>  You will find fans of your particular style and this difference will lead you to success. <br></blockquote><br><blockquote>  <strong>10. Practice.</strong>  Without practice, the theory will be negligible.  Want to write great articles - do it as often as possible. </blockquote><br><br><blockquote>  <strong>11. Respect your readers and treat them with love.</strong>  It is this noble feeling that encourages people to be more close to your thoughts.  Imagine yourself in their place.  Think that it would be interesting for me if I read this article. </blockquote><br><br>  A lot of good and effective articles can be found in our website.  Especially differs from other <a href="http://dtmax.habrahabr.ru/blog/39800.html">dtmax.habrahabr.ru/blog/39800.html</a> , where <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/dtmax/" class="user_link">dtmax</a> expresses his opinion on work in the village. <br>  Let's take a look at the points where and how he applied the above rules: <br><br>  <strong>1. Firmly understand the subject and the main idea of ‚Äã‚Äãyour article.</strong>  Here, of course, every reader can see it.  It is revealed throughout the entire topic and is mentioned more than once. <br><br>  <strong>2. Article must grow.</strong>  I think that dtmax thought about it for a long time, especially since this is his life choice <br><br>  <strong>3. Express your own thoughts and give your own examples.</strong>  Here he clearly singled out the points where he indicated precisely his opinion on what is happening, with obvious examples. <br>  "Nutrition <br>  Cleaner and more environmentally friendly than in the city <br>  Ã∂ in the summer from your garden <br>  Ã∂ trips to the city for shopping.  Once a week for 2 car.  Is quite real. <br>  Village shop.  The choice is small, but you will not die of hunger. <br>  Ã∂ buy meat / milk from fellow villagers <br>  Ã∂ your chickens / ducks (?) " <br><br>  <strong>4. Familiarization with the material</strong> was sufficient, judging by the number of links at the end. <br><br>  <strong>5. Focus on important words and subordinate to them unimportant.</strong>  A large number of selections on the punctuation marks "ecology.  Dnepropetrovsk is an ecological disaster zone. ‚Äù <br><br>  <strong>6. Do not rush from one question to another.</strong>  Everything is consistent and logical.  It is possible to judge the logical placements of the headings, starting from the problem and ending with the results. <br><br>  <strong>7. Be brief.</strong>  Much of the material has been disclosed and almost the entire problem has been disclosed, and it takes a little while.  For example, in this paragraph ‚ÄúWhat does not suit the city,‚Äù he clearly and clearly tells about his problems. <br><br>  8. The remaining menu items were clearly taken into account.  The results can be judged in the number of comments and advantages of the topic. <br><br>  And remember, preparing for each article has its own problems.  Therefore, you must always be confident in yourself.  Think about success, and this will lead you to the desired result.  Like the speech delivered before a large audience, you should approach the writing of the text with a sense of absolute confidence that you will succeed and be recognized by the readers. <habracut></habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/23972/">https://habr.com/ru/post/23972/</a></p>
