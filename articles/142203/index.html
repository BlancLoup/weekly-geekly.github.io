  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Why fun to be more profitable than smart: EQ research in the IT environment</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Researcher David Caruso and a couple of his colleagues are just the guys who, because of their technical skills and intelligence, when hiring at large IT companies, are often rated much <b>lower</b> than emotional intelligence.  That is, the fact that you are smart means much less than what you recognize this guy from the picture: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/696/b6f/ddb/696b6fddb023899297161e215da4dbf0.jpg"><br>  <i>He is closely watching the post.</i> <br><br>  Emotions affect our consciousness, our activity and the perception of things around us.  This is an obvious fact, which, nevertheless, was studied in detail by David Caruso.  He argues, for example, that if you are in a good mood and energetic, you will find a lot of positive and inspiring thoughts and ideas in the topic, and if you are tired or not in a good mood, you will want to criticize and, statistically, you will not be able to think of anything exciting new.

He's like Dr. Lightman from the show, only real. <br><br><h4>  Emotions are important. </h4><br>  <b>Emotions from a purely biological point of view are useful</b> .  They act as a regulatory mechanism and activate certain reflexes.  For example (Caruso throws a piece of paper at the viewer) - surprise.  It dilates the pupils to cover the situation, the mouth opens quickly as you inhale to start running or screaming, and your arms go up for protection.  These are the basic programs that have been in the firmware of each person for many millennia. <br><br>  So, first of all, emotions are useful for action in a business environment.  For example, throwing a piece of paper, Caruso immediately aroused the interest of the entire audience.  If he threw a stone, interest would be higher.  Secondly, surprisingly, emotions are necessary: ‚Äã‚ÄãDamasio argues that without emotions, it is impossible to make rational decisions (sounds strange, right?).  The point is that emotions give an accelerated processing of external data, as if we used hardcode-algorithms.  If you throw a piece of paper at a person, he will raise his hands faster than he is aware of the situation.  If he starts thinking, he will get a piece of paper on his nose. <br><br>  In any conversation, the emotional filter provides even more data - for example, in a couple of seconds you can see a lot of emotional microexpressions and get a lot of information about the reaction of the interlocutor.  And still, emotions are universal and not tied to culture: for example, even the mana in the zoo no one wants to stroke when he shows his usual face. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f9f/b0e/0cd/f9fb0e0cde34075dd6e67d9cee11d5f9.jpg"><br><br>  <i>An example of a mini-exercise to create the desired state.</i>  <i>The emotions of the audience are moved to the green zone.</i> <br><br>  Saloway and Mayer, the theorists of emotional intelligence, continued their work in the 2000s, refined their theories and co-authored with Caruso a book entitled Ability Model, which is aimed at top managers.  It proposed a model of emotional intelligence, a model of ability.  This is primarily a perceptual ability. <br><br><ul><li>  First, roughly speaking, <b>emotions determine our cognitive processes</b> .  In a bad mood, we think very differently, not like in a good mood. </li><li>  Secondly, understanding the emotional meaning of the situation allows you to predict the reaction of other people.  Also very useful for a top manager skill. </li><li>  The last thing is managing your emotions.  On the one hand, you need to be open to emotions in order to understand the situation from all sides, on the other hand you need to be able to influence yourself and other people so that these emotions are used to the best of ways. </li></ul><br><br><h4>  How to measure EQ? </h4><br>  It is clear that we need metrics to find out how effective this or that person is in this area. <br><br>  The first way is to try measuring EQ yourself.  It does not fit, because, as we know, 80% of people consider themselves smarter than average.  The second option is a 360-degree assessment, when you evaluate other people, they evaluate you, you evaluate yourself.  The third type of assessment is tests, for example, MSCEIT exactly from Caruso (by the way, he also has Russian in terms of CTC).  The principle is to show faces and evaluate them according to different scales of emotions. <br><br><h4>  Work in the field </h4><br>  After the appearance of stable metrics, a group of researchers began to study those who achieved success in large companies.  They compared IQ, EQ and a bunch of other indicators.  250 top managers in the field of IT interviewed that most determines the success of the leader.  The most popular answers are: vision (foresight), motivation, empathy. <br><br>  Here is another illustration: Google conducts very detailed research on the topic of success and success: for example, when recruiting new employees, technical skills are item 8. Intellect is important, but not in the first place. <br><br>  According to Caruso, clever people with high EQ, if you take them to work, unleash fewer conflicts, are less prone to vandalism, show a greater propensity for social behavior.  Taking just ‚Äúboring‚Äù wise guys is not as effective as ‚Äúmiddling‚Äù, but with a high EQ. <br><br>  Emotional intelligence is also important because charismatic leaders have the opportunity to infect other people with their emotions.  High emotional intelligence provides greater staff loyalty, greater involvement. <br><br><h4>  Why it may be necessary? </h4><br>  Managing your and other people's emotions is useful.  The simplest example is, for example, before a brainstorming session at the end of the day, try switching staff members with a couple of exercises and a few words from an experienced leader.  Coaches in professional sports, for example, are well aware of how this works - they set up athletes to play very, very long and carefully.  You, as a leader or group member, must understand that all your emotions will be broadcast to the rest of the room. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ac3/b1b/c5c/ac3b1bc5c1bbff2e842922887ff80a0e.png"><br>  <i>I told you, he is watching intently.</i> <br><br><h4>  Good news: you can learn </h4><br>  The first step is recognition.  We are talking about micro-expressions, as with the TV series "Theory of Lie".  The second stage is control and the ability to express emotions (‚Äúturn to the neighbor on the right and show joy‚Äù).  Then read emotions, distinguishing between ‚Äúmasks‚Äù and real data.  Last, it is important to learn how to use emotions and introduce yourself to the desired states.  Including - before negotiations, speeches or just chatting. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/eac/efc/0da/eacefc0da2057e37159e35c8dfe42578.jpg"><br>  <i>Looking at a smile: real?</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/02a/ffd/738/02affd73808e1b68f9711e85d223b0d7.jpg"><br>  <i>We look only at our eyes and understand the truth.</i> <br><br><h4>  Links </h4><br><ul><li>  <a href="http://knowledgestream.ru/lectures/21">Lecture in Digital October</a> (Russian and English versions); </li><li>  <a href="http://www.eiskills.com/">Caruso website;</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25DD%25EC%25EE%25F6%25E8%25EE%25ED%25E0%25EB%25FC%25ED%25FB%25E9_%25E8%25ED%25F2%25E5%25EB%25EB%25E5%25EA%25F2">EQ</a> on the wiki; </li><li>  Fresh book on EQ in the business environment (Goldman, colleague Caruso): ISBN 978-5-9614-1646-6; </li><li>  <a href="http://flibusta.net/b/166029">The book of</a> Paul Ekman with data about lies (interesting from the middle). </li></ul><br><h4>  Summary </h4><br>  Emotions are information from the outside world.  Greater emotionality and greater control of the situation - more data for decision-making, plus more opportunities for managing other people, and this is exactly what makes the top manager successful. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/142203/">https://habr.com/ru/post/142203/</a></p>
