In this material we will describe how the Atlas <a href="https://atlas.ru/microbiome">Microbiota Genetics</a> Test is conducted, why a chair sample is needed for it, and what the user will receive based on the test results.  For our loyal readers, we have prepared a gift at the end of the article! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/d6/ul/pz/d6ulpzbliqsi4tgq0whkvs0yxfg.jpeg"><br>  <i>Illustration by <a href="https://www.behance.net/rentonorama">Rentonorama</a></i> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Disclaimer!  The test ‚ÄúGenetics of microbiota‚Äù is not diagnostic and is intended for healthy adults who want to learn more about the state of their intestines.  If you have symptoms and are worried about health, consult a doctor. <br><br><h2>  Why poop </h2><br>  The intestinal microbiota worldwide is now isolated from a stool sample.  It is simple, safe and cheap.  The analysis of the microbiota in this case is accurate: we can measure the proportions of bacterial families and genera.  However, the picture will be characteristic only for the colon.

      It is difficult to study the bacteria of the small intestine.  Even for the diagnosis of diseases, such as excess bacterial growth syndrome, non-invasive breath tests are used.  Therefore, all the data on the microbiota, in fact, about bacteria of the large intestine. <br><br>  The biomaterial collection box contains a test tube, a pad on the toilet, a spatula, a Bristol scale and instructions.  A special pad prevents the sample from contacting the toilet, which makes the analysis more accurate. <br><br>  Different companies use different overlays.  For example, the Human Microbiome Project issues plastic containers to users in which a sample is immediately packed.  We consider the paper version more environmentally friendly, safer and more economical. <br><br>  Use a spatula to transfer about a pea of ‚Äã‚Äãmaterial into a test tube.  After that, it must be closed and well shaken.  Inside the tube is a solution - it is a DNA stabilizer that does not allow the genetic material of bacteria to spoil to the laboratory.  We use a bactericidal preservative that kills bacteria, but leaves DNA intact. <br><br>  To make the test results more accurate, we ask the user to evaluate his stool sample according to the Bristol scale.  It takes into account the shape and texture, which ultimately affects the result.  Studies show that the harder the sample, the more diverse the human microbiome.  And loose stools are often associated with a scanty composition of bacteria. <br><br><h2>  How is sequencing done </h2><br>  DNA fragments that belong to the specific 16S rRNA gene are isolated from a sample of feces in the laboratory.  RRNA is a ribosomal RNA, and we are studying a gene containing information about it. <br><br>  This gene is one of the main factors in the classification of bacteria and archaea: by its sequence, we determine which genus and family belong to, how close the bacteria are to each other. <br><br>  The 16S rRNA gene is unique in that it combines conservative and variable regions that allow you to determine the genealogy of bacteria (taxonomy).  We read the nucleotide sequence of each such fragment and find out which genus and family the bacterium belongs to.  This can be compared to the definition of a region by car number.  The more identical fragments of 16S rRNA in a sample, the higher the proportion of certain bacteria to which it belongs. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gm/ua/cb/gmuacb50u350lzg9kkmzu7vu44o.jpeg"><br><br>  As a result, we get the percentage composition with a share for each type of microbes.  And the number of microbial species depends on the function of the microbiota.  For example, if you have a lot of bacteria that produce butyric acid, then your microbiota does a good job with this task. <br><br>  Each microbiota profile is compared with the average population figures from the base, which we collected on the basis of scientific work and thanks to the participants of the crowdfunding campaign.  So we analyze how your microbiota differs from the composition of bacteria in a healthy population. <br><br><h2>  What will I get </h2><br>  The composition of intestinal bacteria can determine how the microbiota copes with the processing of fiber, the synthesis of butyric acid, the production of vitamins, as well as how diverse and similar it is to the microbiota of people with diseases. <br><br><h3>  Diversity </h3><br>  This is the first sign that the test user is familiar with.  The diversity of microbiota depends on how stable the community of bacteria is and how well it protects against pathogenic microorganisms.  The more various bacteria in the intestine, the better a person feels and the less he has the risk of developing inflammation.  This has been proven in a number of studies. <br><br>  Unfortunately, it is difficult to get a new type of microorganisms, which is not in the results.  It happens that because of the recommendations those bacteria grow that are initially presented below our threshold (0.02%).  However, this is rather an exception. <br><br><h3>  Fiber recycling and butyric acid synthesis </h3><br>  We have already written that fiber in the diet reduces the risk of disease and mortality from any cause.  However, if the proportion of bacteria that process fiber is small, fiber consumption may be less effective.  In this case, we make a list of products whose consumption increases the proportion of such bacteria. <br><br>  On how effectively microorganisms process fiber, depends on the synthesis of butyric acid.  It nourishes the colonocytes - intestinal epithelial cells.  When this acid is not enough, cells cope worse with pathogenic microorganisms, and the intestine is more susceptible to inflammation. <br><br>  We analyze how many bacteria-producing butyric acid are in the microbiota, and on the basis of this we estimate.  If these microorganisms are small, the recommended product list will appear in the section to improve the situation. <br><br><h3>  Probiotic bacteria </h3><br>  It is known that some types of bacteria are of great benefit to man.  They help intestinal cells regulate immunity, protect against obesity, produce butyric acid and other important metabolites. <br><br>  We analyze the proportion of such microorganisms and collect data in a separate block.  There you can learn more about each probiotic bacterium, what functions it performs and how much it is usually in a healthy population. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/h-/s2/xy/h-s2xyd7w14aulsbdy1texwokhq.png"><br><br>  It is possible to increase the proportion of these bacteria, if they are in the microbiota.  It is enough to use dairy products with live bacteria, sauerkraut, kombuchu (Kombucha), products with types of fiber, on which these microorganisms grow, or special probiotic additives. <br><br>  As for taking supplements, it is better to consult with a specialist first.  Interestingly, probiotic bacteria are beneficial, even if they are not in the human microbiota and they simply pass through the gastrointestinal tract. <br><br><h3>  Disease Immunity </h3><br>  So far, it is poorly understood how bacteria affect the development of diseases and how they interact with drugs.  Nevertheless, there is evidence that in people with diseases the composition of intestinal bacteria is very different.  In our past articles we explained in detail what is known about it at the moment. <br><br>  In the study, we compare your microbiota with the microbiota characteristic of a person with a disease, and evaluate how different profiles are.  If your microbiota is completely different from the patient's microbiota, then you are most fortunate enough to lower your risk.  And if the profiles are similar - then you need to pay attention to the health of the body and the state of intestinal bacteria. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rc/l1/et/rcl1etlnpd2mi97xfqeatzo-fds.png"><br>  <i>List of all diseases in your account</i> <br><br><h3>  Vitamins </h3><br>  The composition of the microbiota depends on how well the bacteria produce vitamins.  They mainly synthesize vitamin K and vitamins of group B. This can affect the overall level of vitamins in the body.  The problem is that we cannot measure how well the intestines absorb these nutrients.  At the same time, the more vitamins the microbiota synthesizes, the more likely they are to be absorbed and to maintain normal levels of trace elements. <br><br><h3>  Enterotypes </h3><br>  Depending on which family and genus of bacteria dominates in the microbiota, all profiles can be divided into three types.  They are also called enterotypes. <br><br>  Bacteria of the genus Bacteroides often dominate in the microbiota of lovers of the Western diet.  In our test, this type is called "A resident of a big city."  Those who love cereals and foods with starch usually have a higher proportion of the Firmicutes family and bacteria producing butyric acid.  We call this type of representative "Village Peasant".  Lovers of vegetables, fruits and sweets are often dominated by the genus Prevotella.  Usually this type is more common among tribal peoples, so in our test it is called ‚ÄúThe inhabitant of the jungle‚Äù. <br><br>  From the enterotype depends on how well the bacteria cope with the processing of fiber, the synthesis of butyric acid and vitamins.  Sometimes one person can have a mixed type of microbiota.  In this case, the zones of projection of bacteria characteristic of each type overlap each other.  But one enterotype will still dominate (the one in the upper layer on the chart). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/an/n6/tw/ann6two_z1zfzarkyxjcnbxxdkw.png"><br><br><h3>  Nutrition Tips </h3><br>  In each sign there is a scale, which is divided into three colors: red, yellow and green.  Green means that everything is fine with you, yellow is within the normal range, and red is a signal for a lifestyle change.  In each problematic symptom there are lists of recommended products.  The only exception is the sign of diversity, which we wrote about above. <br><br>  Lists of foods are compiled based on intestinal bacteria.  We analyze which bacteria in the microbiota are few, which type of fiber they like, and also where these fibers are contained.  It turns out a list that can increase the proportion of needed bacteria. <br><br>  Constantly analyze different lists and select products for the food basket from them - it takes a lot of time and attention.  Therefore, we have made an algorithm that selects several features per week, analyzes the lists of recommended products and makes TOP-10. <br><br>  It is displayed on the main page of our <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/atlas-health/id1372132260">iOS application</a> and in your account, your task is to include these products in your diet this week.  Then the list will be updated: it will contain other signs and products. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/bz/g_/uy/bzg_uy3yvganjx56bhbg4s2mroq.png"><br><br><h2>  What then </h2><br>  Microbiota is constantly updated depending on the diet.  When you eat more meat and sweets, the fiber splitting bacteria becomes small.  The microbiota is worse at coping with pathogenic microorganisms, the risk of inflammation increases.  When you include a lot of vegetables, cereals and fruits in your diet, the proportion of good bacteria grows.  Therefore, the microbiota must be monitored constantly. <br><br>  We recommend repeating the microbiota analysis three months after the first examination.  During this time, if you follow the recommendations, the changes will be more significant, and the habit of including products from the list in the diet will have time to gain a foothold.  So you can track nutrition-related changes and adjust the diet in the right direction. <br><br>  The test ‚ÄúGenetics of microbiota‚Äù costs 12900‚ÇΩ, but for our readers on Habr√© we have prepared a discount.
