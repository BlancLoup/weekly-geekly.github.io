  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The work of the hosting company from the inside</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  We have already tried on Habr√© to open the curtain of mystery for a hosting company.  In our first post of our corporate blog, we held a <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/telhosting/blog/113706/">‚ÄúVirtual Open Day‚Äù</a> and clearly demonstrated to the readers everyday life of data center employees.  Judging by the number of views of the post and the fact that the link to the tour is still on the corresponding <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2594%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0-%25D1%2586%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582%25D1%2580">Wikipedia</a> page, the readers liked the idea.  But the work of the hosting company is not limited to only one data center (if only because it‚Äôs not one).  We will try to tell as much as possible about how the organizational processes in general work.  Of course, it is worth noting that each hoster has its own specifics.  There are hosting companies, consisting of one person, and there are - of several dozen. <br><br>  Our additional feature is that TEL Hosting ( <a href="http://hosting.tel.ru/">hosting.tel.ru</a> ) is a division of the telecommunications company TEL ( <a href="http://www.tel.ru/">tel.ru</a> ) and some specialists work in several parallel areas at once.  We think that the topic concerned will be interesting to many, and even useful to some.  Recently, for example, we are often confronted with customer complaints regarding the company's work schedule.  It‚Äôs stated on our site that technical support works 24/7, but customers swear strongly when applications sent to the sales department on Saturday are processed only on Monday.  Naturally, they are not from anger, but from ignorance - we do not take offense!  They simply decided that next time it would be easier to give a reference to this article than to explain each time what it was and what it was about. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/89b/58f/107/89b58f107193d9d6bcc7a6e15abf8a9a.jpg" alt="Piccy.info - Free Image Hosting"></div><br><br>  Let's start in order.  As we have already mentioned, we have two data centers in Moscow.  On the Baltic, there are mainly servers for our company's own needs (IP-telephony, Internet, etc.), the majority of client projects are located at Electrozavodskaya.  In each of the data centers, we have two engineers working in shifts and a technical support service.  The company's office is located in the same building with the data center on the Baltic (but on different floors).  In addition to the support part in the hosting, one way or another take:

      - information service department (cute girls you talk to when you call us) <br>  - Internet hosting department (which is logical) <br>  PR marketing department (hello Habr!) <br>  -sales department <br>  - network operation department <br>  - department of IP networks <br><br>  How many ponuchru you have here - readers will say!  What to do, our specifics have already been mentioned ... Imagine better on the scheme - how it all works. <br><br>  <b>Reception desk</b> <br>  Having chosen the necessary service on the site, the client calls to our company and gets to the reception.  Girls redirect the call to the Internet hosting department.  Often, customers use several services of our company at once, so they cannot immediately navigate - on which phone you can contact directly the necessary specialist.  Naturally, active hosting users contact the sales department through an extension number. <br><br>  <b>Internet hosting department</b> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/809/4ed/dcd/8094eddcdd41a4a5b89819f4117ea32d.jpg" alt="Piccy.info - Free Image Hosting"></div><br><br>  Department Managers: <br><ul><li>  Advise potential clients on the provision of services </li><li>  Conclude contracts for the provision of services </li><li>  Give discounts to good customers </li><li>  Transfer customers dedicated and collocation data center employees </li><li>  Coordinate the process of interaction between departments </li><li>  Engaged in reporting (but this is not interesting) </li></ul>  From the moment when the invoice is paid, the client either gets access to virtual services (hosting, VPS), or goes to the next stage of a simple quest.  In the case of server rental, data center specialists perform the initial server configuration (Unix installation) and give the user access over IPKVM.  In addition, you can perform the necessary work with the equipment yourself, in the data center, after agreeing on a visit.  Clients of collocation services must deliver their equipment to the data center.  If necessary, our specialists can accept the server and deliver it in Moscow.  Server installation can be done by the owner (for free) or by TEL Hosting staff. <br><br>  <b>Technical support</b> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/918/a44/068/918a4406848185f30cf072c177e889ee.jpg" alt="Piccy.info - Free Image Hosting"></div><br><br>  After installing the server, customers should contact the support with any technical issues.  Technical support staffs do work 24/7/365 and are ready to come to the aid of all current problems.  In the case of complex non-standard situations, the client is again redirected to the Internet hosting department, and from there transit to the specialists of the IP network department. <br><br>  <b>Other departments</b> <br>  Clients are not in direct contact with the operations and IP-networks, except in very rare cases.  With the marketing and PR department you can talk, for example, here on Habr√©. <br><br>  ... <br>  It turned out somehow.  We hope that not too scared.  For our clients, everything looks much simpler, although small patches do occur.  But he is not mistaken, only he who does nothing. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/124232/">https://habr.com/ru/post/124232/</a></p>
