  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Believe your eyes: waiting until 31.12 in the showroom JD.ru</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  ‚ÄúMade in China‚Äù is a pattern that has been living in the heads of the people of Russia since the times of the USSR.  In the Soviet years, it meant the high quality of the desired and relatively affordable sports shoes and textiles;  since perestroika and until the early 2000s, it has become a negative synonym for poor quality.  This state of affairs posed in 2015, the official Chinese manufacturers of modern electronics and gadgets had an incredible difficulty in regaining the glorious name.  The presence in the market of world-famous competitors, the assembly of which takes place in the same China, added problems.  But online retail has become an ally of manufacturers. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0b3/659/879/0b3659879515c5171512c0492f660ca2.jpg"></div><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Thus, according to a <a href="https://yandex.ru/company/researches/2015/ya_ecommerce">survey by Yandex.Market</a> and GFK RUS, published in the fall of 2015, 51% of all foreign online purchases of Russians accounted for Chinese retail.  Over the past year, more than half of those surveyed have used the services of Chinese online stores, which is 30% more than in 2014, and twice as many as in 2013.  In addition, since last year, the share of online shoppers who have taken advantage of the delivery of the Post of Russia has noticeably increased: for the first time, there are more of them than those who chose courier delivery.  Most buyers choose Chinese stores to buy shoes, clothes, smartphones and tablets. <br><br>  Chinese online retailers quickly conquered the Russian market - all one by one, knurled model of online promotion.  JD.ru came to Russia in 2015, later than the rest.  Many aspects of the activity have not yet been honed, the shaft of positive and the flow of negative reviews force the team to look for a couple of extra hours in every day.  Many customers are fond of Chinese brands - online you can find honest and good reviews about smartphones and tablets, authorship of both well-known experts and ordinary users.  However, the problem of distrust remained - what kind of Chinese technology is it, is there a back cover, is the case creaking, is the screen really good ... There are a million questions.

      In addition, the situation with the delivery for several reasons, "lame" in many stores.  According to all the same research, along with the growing popularity of Chinese stores, the number of customers experiencing problems with the delivery of goods increased markedly.  In 2015, among those who made purchases abroad, 26% received low-quality goods (21% in 2014), 12% did not what they ordered (9% in 2014), 7% did not receive the goods at all and could not return money (5% in 2014).  This growth, of course, is partly due to the incredible growth in demand for Chinese goods in 2015. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7a8/a5c/bd6/7a8a5cbd639d556c7c38aa5f2df81d59.jpg"></div><br>  That is why, taking into account all the market concerns, JD.ru went for an experiment - <b>from December 4 to 9, the</b> show room JD.ru worked in one of the most technologically advanced departments of the Russian Post, the logistics partner of JD.  during the period <b>from 4 to 9 December,</b> over 2,000 orders for JD Collection smartphones were issued at the site with delivery via an authorized postal operator JD.ru Russian Post - all selected smartphones were presented in the show room during the test launch .  Here‚Äôs how it was: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/588/358/f86/588358f8695e71e27b100685df6b829b.jpg"></div><br>  Already on the day of the closing of the showroom, there was an understanding that the idea was a success, and there was much more confidence in the brands whose products you can touch.  In fact, we have implemented a model of the behavior of a modern customer: touch it offline, buy online.  The decision to extend the work of the first offline site JD.ru was made jointly with the key logistics partner of Russian Post on the basis of a successful test launch. <br><br>  From December 14, 2015, the JD.ru showroom on the basis of the Russian Post office will continue its work - the site will be open until December 31, 2015.  In its space, products of key JD Collection partner brands are represented - Xiaomi, OnePlus, Nubia, Zuk, Wileyfox, Zopo, IUNI, and others, most of which are already available for order on JD.ru.  We have already written about the new LETV X3-43 FHD LED smart TV model - we remind you that it will be available in the showroom, as well as several others. <br><br>  We should also make a reservation about JD Collection.  This is a ‚Äúspecial‚Äù brand zone in which only original products from brand manufacturers are placed, guaranteeing quality, fast delivery, reasonable price level, annual warranty service and the ability to return goods within 30 days after purchase. <br><br>  Products presented in the showroom will not be sold directly on the site, but the staff will provide guests with all the necessary advice and help buyers place an order for JD.ru.  All orders issued with the help of consultants in the showroom will be delivered by the federal postal service Russian Post.  Additionally, activities and special offers for visitors are planned on the site, which you can learn more about in the official JD.ru groups on social networks. <br><br>  We are waiting for you at st.  Shabolovka d.69 / 32 during the working hours of the site: on weekdays - from 9:30 to 19:30, on Saturday - from 9:00 to 18:00, on Sunday - from 9:00 to 14:00.  Here it is: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4cf/e9f/991/4cfe9f9918c359d09a15a0bcd906811e.png"></div><br>  We invite you to visit!  All we will show, we will tell, we will answer questions, we will help to order. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/369237/">https://habr.com/ru/post/369237/</a></p>
