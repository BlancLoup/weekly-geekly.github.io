  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How much does media advertising in Germany cost to advertiser. Analysis.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  About the study and work, the topics were already there, so I decided to add a topic, to explore the advertising market of the FRGnet, how much is the media on the Internet on the main resources, if we want to conduct an advertising campaign.  Part 1 - how much we spend.  Part two will soon consider the opposite side - how much we can earn as webmasters. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So, I took the largest portals of Germany as a sample, one of the largest media resource, the largest weather site, the largest news resource, the most popular ICQ messenger, banner networks. <br><br><h2>  1. Portals: </h2><br><br>  - Germany's largest portal <a href="http://www.t-online.de/">www.t-online.de</a> with a monthly unique audience of 15.2 million users.  For some reason, the advertising rates for it are not published in the public domain, only by call or order. <br>  - the second largest <a href="http://www.web.de/">www.web.de</a> - 13.3 million <a href="http://www.web.de/">unique users</a> per month has more than 90 services.  Advertising opportunities are very diverse, I chose standard media elements for analysis.  Cost per 1000 impressions.  Prices depend on targeting and placement - end-to-end or only a specific rubric, restriction on unique and temporal targeting. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      Banner Top 728x90 - from 15 to 30 euros, depending on the targeting. <br>  120x600 - from 15 to 30. <br>  300x250 - from 25 to 40. <br>  The tandem 728x90 and 120x600 is very popular and actually interesting - 25-40, I have not seen anything like it in Runet and Bynet. <br>  pop-under 640x480 - 70 euros. <br>  Link in the thematic section - 0.3 euro per click (there is so boldly allocated that traffic. Millionth a day :)) <br>  The context in the search (they have a google engine) - from 0.3 to 1.2 euro per click. <br><br>  Discounts start at 10 thousand euros 3% and up to 20% from 1 million euros.  Judging by such poor discounts with orders they have everything there is good. <br><br>  The situation is similar for the portal <a href="http://www.gmx.de/">www.gmx.de</a> with 8.4 million visitors per month.  They have 12 thematic headings, each of which has owl services.  Both the portal sells one agency, so the prices are apparently the same. <br><br><h2>  2. Website of media TV company <a href="http://www.pro7.de/">www.pro7.de</a> </h2><br><br>  5.7 million unik per month 62% of which are from 14 to 29 years old. <br><br>  Banner 468x60 in the first screen - from 15 to 30 euros. <br>  728x90 in the top - 15-30 <br>  120x600 - 15 -40 <br>  300x250 - 30 -50 euros <br><br><h2>  3. Advertising in ICQ Messenger </h2><br><br>  The partner of which is the same pro7 in Germany.  The trick is that in Germany they practically do not use (only if Russian immigrants :)) are not official clients.  32% of the market of instant messages holds ICQ (Skype, for example, only 15%) with an audience of 8.4 million unik per month and 4.1 million unik per day. <br><br>  468x60 banner in the dialog box - from 2.5 to 3 euros <br>  Dynamic corner - from 10 to 12 euros <br>  Banner 120x90 in the contact list of 2.5 -3 euros. <br><br>  I can say here that the price tag is quite sane, for example, a client just launched by ICQ in Belarus has an audience of 320 thousand per month, for dollars, respectively: 1.5 - 3 dollars, 7.7 dollars, 2 dollars.  Target ve remarkable by gender, age, time of day. <br><br><h2>  4. The largest news resource <a href="http://www.bild.de/">www.bild.de</a> </h2><br><br>  4.6 million unik per month. <br><br>  Top banner 468x60 - from 5 to 40!  Euro. <br>  The top 728x90 - from 15 to 40 euros. <br>  300x250 - 25 - 40 euros. <br><br>  Despite the fact that the audience is smaller than that of the portals, but traditionally the news traffic is more expensive.  40 euros for 468x60 - that's cool. <br><br><h2>  5. Weather at <a href="http://www.wetter.de/">www.wetter.de</a> </h2><br><br>  4.23 million unique users per month.  Type of our gismeteo, apparently. <br><br>  468x60 - from 15 to 20 <br>  728x90 -15 -20 euros <br>  120x600 - the same 15 -20 euros <br>  300x250 - 30 -40 euros. <br><br><h2>  6. Banner networks, such as <a href="http://www.adsklick.de/">www.adsklick.de</a> or www5.adklick.de </h2><br><br>  It seemed to me strange that there is no statistics anywhere in real time, just words, that there are 600 partners ... <br><br>  cost to advertiser for impressions or for clicks. <br><br>  1000 impressions cost from 85 cents to 1.15 euros, depending on the volume. <br>  1 click costs from 9 to 15 Euro cents. <br><br>  There is still in Germany the most popular social sphere studiVZ.de with 5.5 million registered users.  But they did not post the price tag, it‚Äôs necessary to call.  Although I know from my sources that things are going very well for them, it‚Äôs true that Facebook has recently filed a lawsuit against them, such as what they used for its code ... <br><br><h2>  Results </h2><br><br>  Summarizing, we can say that in order to conduct a more or less normal advertising campaign in Germany, at least thousands should be thrown in.  100- 200 euros, less even makes no sense.  In this case, it would be interesting to receive orders for seo from there, I think that it would be cheaper to receive traffic in this way, and already having an audience to start selling advertising or services and then already throwing it into further development.  The contextual budget merges in Germany for two times, the cost of a click from 10 cents to 5 euros on average, depending on the topic.  + The fact that every serious site has relevant research of its audience and the ability to choose the target traffic. <br><br>  The second part of my analysis will be devoted to the earnings of the webmaster, where, how and how much you can get from your site.  In the comments leave interesting questions that you need will not be forgotten. <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/50478/">https://habr.com/ru/post/50478/</a></p>
