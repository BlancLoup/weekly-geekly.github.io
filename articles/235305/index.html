Many people liked PowerUp 3.0 due to the originality of their ideas.  And this is not a concept, but a very real project, and the author has already shipped the first batch of PowerUP 3.0, which got to the first owners, and they turned out to be quite a few. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/633/545/6a1/6335456a132fb78218216d0ecf1828e3.png" width="800">

      In general, many already had enough of the airplane, respectively, began to receive comments, suggestions and comments about the advantages and disadvantages of the system.  I think it is worthwhile to state all this in a new small review, since the experience of current owners will help to work with PowerUP 3.0 to new owners without any problems.  There are many nuances, some concern the paper, part - applications for controlling the airplane, and another part - wireless modules. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  The new post may well be considered an addition to the official instructions, and this addition is written by a whole community of PowerUP 3.0 users.  Information crowdfunding, otherwise you will not name. <br><br>  As mentioned above, all new materials are divided into categories: <br><ul><li>  Paper, airplane design; </li><li>  Battery and energy; </li><li>  Wireless modules; </li><li>  Smartphone application. </li></ul><br><br><h3>  Paper, airplane design </h3><br><br>  Apparently, the airplane, created on the <a href="http://www.poweruptoys.com/pages/download">basis of the free template Nakamuru</a> flies better than the one that comes in the kit. <br><br>  This may seem obvious, but, as it turned out, PowerUP 3.0 users do not always understand that its aerodynamic characteristics also depend on the accuracy of the paper.  As in childhood: the plane was crookedly folded, and it flew nose down.  The paper should be smooth, the design should be symmetrical. <br><br>  No matter how you fold the airplane, each new one will differ from the previous one.  Some will be demolished to the right, some - to the left, the third will fly perfectly.  There is an advice to punch paper with a hole punch, in key places - as far as can be judged, it improves flight performance. <br><br>  If the paper is wrinkled during operation, then the airplane no longer flies as well as at the very beginning.  In addition, it is advisable to use paper more tightly, although ordinary office paper is quite suitable.  In this case, the airplane withstands about half an hour of flights, after which (due to falls, deformation of the paper), you need to fold a new one. <br><br>  It should make a little softer folds on the front edge of the wing, the wing will be tougher and will be better able to withstand flights.  In addition, after the final edging, when it is time to fold the wings, turn the central fold.  Now additional paper layers will be on the leading edge below the wing, not on the top.  Then fold the wings and the ends of the wings, as described in the instructions. <br><br><h3>  Battery and energy </h3><br><br>  The battery lasts for a large number of short flights, despite the stated time of 10 minutes of regular work.  In addition, the good news is that charging the plane takes only about 20 minutes - you can purchase an external power supply and play all day. <br><br>  The on / off button is not the most convenient - it is difficult to press it, due to the small size of the button. <br><br>  When falling and hitting the ground, the airplane turns off, so you need to turn it on again.  Many users immediately thought that the airplane was failing, in fact - this is "a feature, not a bug." <br><br>  Among other things, when charging the airplane you need to turn it on. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4e7/075/cd3/4e7075cd3616a41fd55fc883b0c32bf3.jpg"><br><br><h3>  WiFi and Bluetooth </h3><br><br>  The airplane is controlled from a smartphone application via Bluetooth, but some owners note that the airplane works better if you turn off WiFi, leaving only Bluetooth.  What is the reason for this is unknown. <br><br>  It is best to go for the airplane in the control process, so you can control the device for a longer time, until it leaves the range of the wireless signal.  Well, the approximate radius is 30 meters, although it is indicated at about 55. However, with the removal the airplane begins to react worse to control. <br><br><h3>  application </h3><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c56/1d5/6d7/c561d56d73509bac0159bc820d35ede0.jpg"><br><br>  Soon the updated application will be released, which will allow you to control two small aircrafts updated, arranging competitions between separate "aircraft". <br><br>  Sometimes the application crashes, though not at all. <br><br>  Well, and finally, without exception, the owners of airplanes note that if you run them in a crowded place, the operator will immediately become the center of attention for everyone.  Both children and adults surround the ‚Äúpilot‚Äù and ask to steer.  So get ready to feel like a star. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/h5_zhCvMc74%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjMouN2QHLZd7gAT9OBooNIcMJNZg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h5>  Price and order </h5><br>  The basic kit can be <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/powerup-3-0-bumazhnyj-samolet.html">ordered in Russia from Medgadgets</a> for 1900 rubles. <br><br>  Or, such a kit can be <a href="http://www.poweruptoys.com/">ordered from the developer</a> .
