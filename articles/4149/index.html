  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Moscow and St. Petersburg live in antiphase</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  On Friday afternoon, I abandoned an offer to friends in the LiveJournal to make me a company at a Sting concert.  My old friend from Novgorod responded, but ICQ got stuck, and we did not have time to agree.  And he did not reply by mail.  On Saturday morning, I dropped the ticket prices, but the answer never came.  The problem is that he only has an internet connection at work. <br><br>  A similar story happens with most of my St. Petersburg acquaintances - on the weekend they do not exist for their virtual friends. <br><br>  I was curious as to how this situation is a common place, and whether it is possible to use statistics as a GPS navigator.

      I took data from <a href="http://gs.spylog.ru/r/%3FreportId%3D4%26amp%3BcategoryId%3D1">Spylog</a> on the distribution of attendance from cities (data for April and June) and found that ... <br><br>  Do you know when Muscovites start Monday?  - No, not on Saturday.  - On Sunday.  The largest and most distinct growth of the Moscow Internet audience is on Sunday.  And on Friday there is the largest drop in the number of Internet visitors from Moscow during the week.  On Saturday, Muscovites rest, and on Sunday, "residents and guests of our city" go to "clean up the tails" before the start of work week.  This is very clear to me: after five days of 8-hour monitoring of the monitor screen, I myself cannot see these google-yandex-rambler.  And half of Sunday I sit and rivet plans for projects and this column. <br><br>  Moreover, if in April, when it was still cold, Muscovites lost interest in the Network only on Friday, but now, in summer, it begins to decline already on Thursday.  Although now the statistics are pretty spoiled by the football championship.  And last weekend people are sitting at home, on the Internet, and, like a damned one, they are staring at screens. <br><br>  In St. Petersburg people, unlike Muscovites, on Friday, everything is just beginning.  Friday is the most active day of virtual life in the northern capital.  The reason is that many do not have access from home and go to the Network only from work.  And on the last day, I have such a suspicion, St. Petersburg people do not work so much as read the news and sit in the LiveJournal.  According to a recent study by <a href="http://www.rmh.ru/news/res_results/288.html">ROMIR Monutoring</a> , this is what most employees take.  And, by the way, if employers in Moscow gave up on it, then in St. Petersburg the other day my acquaintance at the office imposed severe restrictions. <br><br>  Least of all, St. Petersburg people go to the Internet on Sunday.  I think this is a question of psychology.  Most people try to rest on the last day to the fullest and stay away from the computer, even if he is at home.  The rise of interest in virtual life, as a rule, does not begin on Monday, but on Tuesday.  It seems that on Monday the people work, and they only allow themselves to be distracted by surfing on the second service day. <br><br>  By the way, it is curious that the last days of April, before the May holidays, Muscovites on the Internet abruptly departed, and Petrograd people became more.  It seems that the residents of the capital, despite the high season, took advantage of three days off to move to the south.  But St. Petersburg people stayed at home. <br><br>  The same structure of user behavior is observed in the regions, in the same Krasnodar, the third city by the number of users (according to Spylog), and Novgorod, which is in 8th place: a surge of interest in the Network on Friday, and complete indifference on Sunday.  Therefore, it seems that I will not know until Monday whether my old friend from Novgorod will come to Sting‚Äôs concert or not. <br><br>  And you know what thought comes about this?  - That the most virtualized in our near future will be the residents of St. Petersburg.  First, the rise in prices for dial-up and lower prices for broadband access will have an impact.  Secondly, the ever-strengthening contacts of the two capitals will also make themselves felt and pull the St. Petersburg people into the Network.  And behind them regions will catch up.  And a sure sign will be a change in the structure of user behavior, which we will be able to observe with you. <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/4149/">https://habr.com/ru/post/4149/</a></p>
