A year and a half ago, the <a href="https://www.firebase.com/blog/2014-10-21-firebase-joins-google.html">Firebase</a> development team <a href="https://www.firebase.com/blog/2014-10-21-firebase-joins-google.html">joined our friendly Google team</a> .  Since then, our BaaS (backend-as-service) has more than quadrupled - from 110 to 450 thousand developers.  And all this time we have provided all the same services - DBRV (real-time database), user authorization, hosting - making application development easier.  It is time to move on, so we are pleased to present you a major expansion of the capabilities of Firebase. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/dd7/416/e0c/dd7416e0c85be83ae929680c6a5c7b89.png"></div><br><br>  Firebase is becoming a universal platform for building Android, iOS, and mobile web applications.  New tools to simplify development, attract users and monetize, as well as a new product in the field of analytics are waiting for you under the cut. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  We have always remained faithful to the principles that were built into Firebase initially: <br><ul><li>  The developer is our user, and the user experience is very important.  Ease of use, quality documentation, intuitive APIs make the developer happy; <br></li><li>  Kostplatformennost.  IOS, Android and the mobile web are equally important to us; <br></li><li>  Integration of products where possible.  Firebase has one SDK, one console, and one place where you can get answers to your questions, support, and all the necessary documentation.  You choose that from our capabilities and in what combination to combine, our task is to ensure the fastest and most comfortable work with data wherever possible. <br></li></ul>

    <h2>  Firebase analytics </h2><br>  <b>Firebase Analytics</b> is a new free tool for ... analyzing mobile apps.  In part, he inherited something from Google Analytics, but has a number of significant differences: <br><br>  First, Firebase Analytics runs around user and events.  Sessions, page views and application screens are good, but Google already has it.  Our new product focuses on what the user is doing in your application.  Also, you can find out exactly where users come to you - tracking paid advertising and channels to attract users gives visual graphs and tables. <br><br>  Secondly, we have already spoken about the principle of rational integration - here it is implemented to the fullest.  FA provides reliable information about user activity within the application, which allowed the implementation of a new function - <b>Audience</b> .  Audiences allow you to identify different groups of users with similar properties.  Subsequently, you will be able to receive separate information for different Audiences within a single Firebase environment. <br><br><h2>  Accelerate development with Messaging, Storage and Config features </h2><br>  Modern applications very often use interactive interactions in one way or another - therefore we expand our backend services.  Google Cloud Messaging - the most popular service for delivering push notifications from the cloud to devices - is now integrated into Firebase and is called FCM - <b>Firebase Cloud Messaging</b> .  It is completely free, has no restrictions, is perfectly optimized, saves the battery of client devices and works great on iOS, Android and in modern browsers.  At the very core of FCM is scalability - today more than 170 billion (!) Messages are sent through it every day to ~ 2 billion different devices. <br><br>  We have long been asked to add the ability to store images, videos, and just learn how to transfer files - now, thanks to Google Cloud Storage, we provide such an opportunity.  <b>Firebase Storage</b> allows developers to easily and securely organize file downloads and storage, and a robust Google platform and technology ensures unrivaled accessibility, integration into Google services and scalability.  We also paid attention to advanced logic in the client SDK for Firebase Storage, so our service works fine even in an unstable Internet connection. <br><br>  <b>Firebase Remote Config</b> allows developers to fine-tune and update application elements on the fly without having to update an application package and wait for it to be available in the application store and then updated with users.  You can turn on and off certain elements of applications, distribute the update to specific audience of users - and all this is literally a couple of clicks. <br><br>  Of course, we have not forgotten about already existing products - BDVR, hosting and user authentication.  Hosting has received a new interface and free support for third-party domains for all developers.  The database will receive a major update in the near future, but for now we can‚Äôt tell anything about it.  Wait, the update will not disappoint you.  The largest update received <b>Firebase Authentication</b> - here both the new SDK and the redesigned backend structure - everything that is needed for improvements in security, reliability and scalability.  Inside, the same technologies are used as in other Google products that work with Google user accounts.  We also added linked accounts and proof of ownership of e-mail - something we have been asked for a long time. <br><br><h2>  Simplify Debugging: Test Lab and Crash Reporting </h2><br>  Falling apps are bad.  Users are dissatisfied, write all sorts of nastiness in the reviews, put one star, go to competitors.  <b>FIrebase Crash Reporting</b> collects and sends you the most important information that can help in finding problems for iOS / Android applications after release.  Of course, the Audience function also works here, which is looking for similar signs - you will immediately see if users have something in common with a similar problem: the same device, locale, specific region of application use, or maybe certain usage scenarios applications. <br><br>  At the last I / O (in 2015), we introduced the Cloud Test Lab - cloud testing of your applications on real devices, which are located in our data centers.  Now this service will be called <b>Firebase Test Lab</b> and will get all the benefits of integration with Firebase tools. <br><br><h2>  Expanding Applications </h2><br>  Even the most useful applications sooner or later face a decline in user interest.  Firebase has five effective tools to help you get the attention of your customers. <br><br>  <b>Firebase Notifications</b> - a new interface built on the basis of the Firebase Cloud Messaging API, complemented by Firebase Analytics and Audiences.  It allows you to target notifications to users of your application without touching the source code editor.  It‚Äôs now easier to share new promotions, discounts, offer personalized conditions, and draw people's attention to new opportunities. <br><br>  <b>Firebase Dynamic Links</b> improves work with links in two ways at once.  First, the links have become ‚Äúreliable‚Äù.  That is, they lead to a specific location of the application (for example, to a specific project, event, company, whatever), even if the user has navigated through it and just first downloaded your application from Google Play.  No more questions "I downloaded the application, what's next" or repeated clicks on the links.  Such a ‚Äúwarm reception‚Äù showed excellent results in terms of user involvement in the work with the application. <br><br>  Secondly, links can dynamically change their purpose depending on the environment in which they are running: different devices, browsers, clients - something like an advanced &amp; utm_source. <br><br>  Firebase Invites allows you to build a referral network in two accounts - let your clients bring new ones.  Minimum effort, maximum results. <br><br>  <b>Firebase App Indexing</b> , (formerly Google App Indexing) allows Google users to find results directly from your application.  Taking into account the new features of Android N by launching applications without installation, an accelerated installation (if the user still needed it) and new features of Dynamic Links you will regularly replenish the user base with those who are really interested in your products. <br><br>  AdWords, our advertising platform, is now integrated into Firebase.  Firebase tracks the progress of your AdWords campaign and automatically fills in the relevant sections in Firebase Analytics.  As you have probably already guessed, Audience and event tracking are also included here: this way you can customize AdWord parameters to achieve maximum advertising campaigns. <br><br><h2>  Monetizing applications with AdMob </h2><br>  The process of integrating various products was unstoppable.  :) So the Google advertising platform is now also part of the Firebase exosystem.  We have simplified the work with AdMob: as soon as you start using Firebase SDK in your project - AdMob is at your service.  Various advertising formats (including native advertising), high-quality statistics, integration with other elements of Firebase are already included. <br><br><h2>  New console, documentation and SDK </h2><br>  At the very beginning of the post, we said that Firebase has one SDK, one console, and one place where you can get answers to your questions, support, and all the necessary documentation.  This place is <a href="http://firebase.google.com/%3Futm_campaign%3DFirebase_announcement_awareness_general_en_05-18-16_%26utm_source%3Dgdev%26utm_medium%3Dblog">firebase.google.com</a> . <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/23f/988/abb/23f988abb6b15d3b50faf753a070b340.png"></div><br><br>  Well, since Firebase has a new home now, we have chosen the most modern interior.  The new console has received a redesigned interface that is closely integrated with other Google products, such as Google Play, Google Cloud, and those projects that have moved under the wing of Firebase. <br><br>  Integration with Google Cloud carried out at a very deep level.  For example, Firebase Analytics can export raw data to BiqQuery for further analysis.  We will continue to build bridges between Google Cloud and Firebase, and expand your ability to use our cloud.  Another good example of integration is linking your Google Play developer account to a Firebase account - this way the console becomes the center where everything about everything flows: starting with users, purchases inside your application, and using features from different groups of users, ending with financial data. <br><br>  Finally, we are pleased to present you a beta version of the new C ++ SDK.  All documentation and the necessary "starter pack" are already <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/cpp/setup%3Futm_campaign%3DFirebase_announcement_awareness_general_en_05-18-16_%26utm_source%3Dgdev%26utm_medium%3Dblog">available</a> on our website. <br><br><h2>  Price policy </h2><br>  Most of the new products, including Analytics, Crash Reporting, Remote Config, and Dynamic Links, are completely free and have no limitations.  Paid services - Test Lab, Storage, BDRV and hosting - have got a <a href="https://firebase.google.com/pricing/">simplified price grid</a> .  Today we offer: <br><ul><li>  The free SPARK tariff with some restrictions is perfect for the first steps, the prototype of the application, course work or thesis, the start of a startup; <br></li><li>  Fixed rate for FLAME tariff for those who need a predictable monthly value at the early stages of the application development; <br></li><li>  Payment of consumed resources - a configurable BLAZE tariff for the largest customers. <br></li></ul><br><br><h2>  Constancy of beauty </h2><br>  After Google I / O 2016, much has changed, but the basic principles of Firebase remain the same.  Our main goal is simple and comfortable development with our APIs, intuitive interfaces, comprehensive documentation and tight product integration.  We are committed to cross-platform development for iOS, Android and the web, and if you encounter difficulties, we will be happy to provide you with all possible support. <br><br>  If you already use our products, nothing will change for you until you want it yourself.  We will continue to support old customers and their products, but we advise you to familiarize yourself with the updates and evaluate the new features of Firebase, not for nothing that we tried ?!  :) <br><br><h2>  Future plans </h2><br>  We have done a great job, but we have something to improve in Firebase.  To date, the JavaScript SDK does not yet support all the new features.  We have thrown all our efforts on bridging the gap in these technologies, and we will be happy to hear your feedback - for sure, we have something else to improve.  You can leave an opinion about the new features of Firebase, report a bug or suggest an idea <a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/contact/bugs-features/%3Futm_campaign%3DFirebase_announcement_awareness_general_en_05-18-16_%26utm_source%3Dgdev%26utm_medium%3Dblog">here</a> . <br><br>  In the meantime, you can personally try new features.  Check out our new <a href="https://firebase.google.com/%3Futm_campaign%3DFirebase_announcement_awareness_general_en_05-18-16_%26utm_source%3Dgdev%26utm_medium%3Dblog">website</a> , rate the <a href="http://firebase.google.com/docs%3Futm_campaign%3DFirebase_announcement_awareness_general_en_05-18-16_%26utm_source%3Dgdev%26utm_medium%3Dblog">documentation</a> and try <a href="https://console.firebase.google.com/%3Futm_campaign%3DFirebase_announcement_awareness_general_en_05-18-16_%26utm_source%3Dgdev%26utm_medium%3Dblog%26pli%3D1">using Firebase</a> in your products, as large projects like Shazam, SkyScanner and PicCollage are already doing. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/302482/">https://habr.com/ru/post/302482/</a></p>
