      In Crocodile, we play with friends for a long time.  First they played in real life, then they created a community of VKontakte.  But VKontakte was inconvenient to play, and the game quickly stalled.  Then I had the idea to make a special site dedicated to the Crocodile.  Site requirements - sharpened for a specific version of the rules of the Crocodile, a convenient interface for the game and the players communicate with each other (without communication, much of the fun is lost).  In addition, a simple interface was needed so that players could create the games themselves.  Exactly in a month the site was made (from idea to launch). <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The CodeIgniter framework was chosen as the site engine as the most convenient and scalable.  Writing modules on it is a pleasure.  JQuery is responsible for testing the site on the client side.  The basis of the user base is the PhpBB3 forum, which has been integrated with CodeIgniter. <br><br>  The site is already two months old, during which time he has managed to acquire a small regular audience.  Also many bugs were removed, and some changes were made to the rules.  For example, one of the players suggested the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãhow to develop them.  This idea was voted on and everyone liked it.  As a result, new types of games were added (complex and associative).  At the request of the players chat was introduced.  At the moment, the players created and guessed about 500 games. <br><br>  But the most interesting thing is that with regular players (of course, with those who live nearby and who could come) we arranged a meeting in a restaurant.  The meeting was interesting, there were many ideas for the development of the site.  The introduction of these ideas, we are now engaged. <br><br>  At the moment, the main development of the project is on the path of attracting new (adequate) players. <br><br>  We are waiting for your questions and comments, and, perhaps, tips.  We will be glad to new players (we treat newcomers kindly - even the system tells them the first week how to create new puzzles). <br><br>  Thanks for attention! <br><br>  <a href="http://www.kpoko.com/">Association site</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/75764/">https://habr.com/ru/post/75764/</a></p>
