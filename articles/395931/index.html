It got to the point that manufacturers deliberately produce electronics that can not be repaired and / or not designed for prolonged use. <br><br>  But from this sad rule there are some striking exceptions.  One of them is the <a href="http://www.linksys.com/us/p/P-WRT54GL/">Linksys WRT54GL</a> home router, which was released in 2005 and <i>is still being sold</i> .  This is a rare example of how good quality and <b>free software support</b> have become the guarantee of absolute commercial success, <a href="http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/07/the-wrt54gl-a-54mbps-router-from-2005-still-makes-millions-for-linksys/">writes</a> Ars Technica. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  At first glance, it is not clear why this old model of the router is still popular.  Judge for yourself, because the WRT54GL works according to the old 802.11g standard, after which modern 802.11n and 802.11ac came out.  It supports only the 2.4 GHz frequency band, and the data transfer rate is limited to 54 Mbps.  Now you can easily buy a new model for <i>less money</i> with all modern standards, work in the 2.4 and 5 GHz bands, with a maximum speed of 20 times higher.

He assures that no one is thinking of removing this outdated router model from sale.  It will produce as long as suppliers continue to produce the necessary components, including Broadcom chips.  ‚ÄúWe continue to make them, because people continue to buy them,‚Äù says La Duca. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d92/029/776/d92029776706485ca3ac2730c8149847.jpg"><br>  <i>Linksys WRT54GL version 1.1 motherboard and interiors</i> <br><br>  The legendary WRT54GL has one secret that can explain the popularity of this router. <br><br>  Look at the story.  The first model WRT54G was released in December 2002 with firmware on the Linux kernel.  For the first time, this revolutionary model with the support of the new-fashioned 11g standard was shown at the computer exhibition COMDEX in November 1999 as an ‚Äúintegrated Internet hub‚Äù.  The Linksys employees recall that at the exhibition Bill Gates approached them, looked at the device created by them and asked: ‚ÄúWhy don't you guys just call it a‚Äú router ‚Äù?‚Äù <br><br>  The Linksys managers took advice from the gurus and changed the product name from ‚ÄúIntegrated Internet Hub‚Äù to ‚ÄúBroadband EtherFast Router‚Äù. <br><br>  After the start of sales, the router (router) with firmware on the Linux kernel immediately became popular. <br><br>  After buying Linksys new owner - Cisco - decided to change the firmware from Linux to VxWorks.  She began to put with the 5th version of the WRT54G.  But after the mass protests of users, the company still returned the original version on the Linux kernel, releasing the WRT54GL model in 2005 (‚ÄúL‚Äù in the name means ‚ÄúLinux‚Äù). <br><br>  The company then faced <a href="http://archive.is/WbzzC">a lawsuit</a> from the Free Software Foundation for violating the terms of the GPL license.  The lawsuit was <a href="http://www.fsf.org/news/2009-05-cisco-settlement.html">settled</a> in 2009 using donations to the Free Software Foundation and publishing the source code of the firmware.  This was the most important step in the history of the WRT54GL router. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6b1/21f/4c6/6b121f4c618e4ff08c18720dc345bc6d.jpg"><br>  <i>WRT54G version 2.0 with advanced 7 dBi antennas</i> <br><br>  Another feature of the WRT54GL was <i>removable antennas</i> , which were replaced with more powerful and long-range third-party antennas.  Craftsmen quickly established the release of such products (unfortunately, from the 8th version for the sake of cost reduction, removable antennas were replaced with non-removable ones). <br><br>  <b>Configuration of the latest version of WRT54GL 8.2</b> <br>  <b>Processor</b> : Broadcom BCM5354, 240 MHz <br>  <b>RAM</b> : 8 MB <br>  <b>Flash memory</b> : 2 MB <br>  <b>S / N prefix</b> : CDFJ <br><br>  Following a lawsuit from the Free Software Foundation, Linksys was forced to release the GPL source firmware code.  Immediately, several forks appeared that corrected errors, corrected and supplemented the original firmware, and many new models of routers appeared that supported these free firmware.  The most popular of the free firmware - <a href="http://www.dd-wrt.com/">DD-WRT</a> , <a href="http://www.polarcloud.com/tomato">Tomato</a> and <a href="https://www.openwrt.org/">OpenWrt</a> . <br><br>  Ironically, it was as a result of the lawsuit from the Free Software Foundation that the legendary WRT54GL model was born, as well as free firmware, which ultimately brought so much long-term commercial success to the router. <br><br>  Over the past 13.5 years since the release of the first version of the WRT54G, Linksys has sold 31 million routers in this line, and the WRT54GL is the only one that is still being sold. <br><br>  It seems the company understands the secret of the success of its model.  For example, on June 2, 2016, new regulations of the Telecommunication Commission (FCC) came into effect in the United States, which prohibit the installation of third-party firmware on home routers in <a href="https://ecfsapi.fcc.gov/file/7521096518.pdf">order to rule out interference with radars</a> .  All manufacturers <a href="http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/03/tp-link-blocks-open-source-router-firmware-to-comply-with-new-fcc-rule/">obediently complied with the instructions of the FCC</a> , including TP-Link, and blocked the installation of third-party firmware.  But not Linksys: she specially <a href="http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/05/linksys-wrt-routers-wont-block-open-source-firmware-despite-fcc-rules/">thought out the scheme</a> in order to meet the new requirements of the FCC, but leave the possibility of installing third-party firmware on the WRT54GL.  The fact is that only routers in the 5 GHz band can interfere with radars. <br><br>  By the way, there are not so many routers in the Linksys model lineup that support third-party open source firmware.  Of the current models, these are only expensive WRT1200AC, WRT1900AC and WRT1900ACS, which cost starts at $ 150. <br><br>  The company was forced to open the source code of the firmware, and thanks to this ‚Äúmagic kick‚Äù, she was able to earn millions and for 11 years has sold the model of the router, which has become a classic.  In online stores and forums Linksys can find reviews of satisfied customers, left a few weeks ago. <br><br>  It is a pity that the company in the latest versions reduced the cost of the assembly and abandoned the removable antennas.  WRT54GL routers have always been considered very reliable.  Let's hope that the devices purchased now will serve their owners for a very long time, as their ancestors have served since 2005. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/395931/">https://habr.com/ru/post/395931/</a></p>
