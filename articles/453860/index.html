So, two days ago, at Computex, the new Ryzen processors of the three thousandth series <a href="https://www.amd.com/en/events/computex">were introduced to the</a> public. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/tw/fn/g2/twfng2zzwf4dm2d65b8gxou5tnq.png"><br><br>  Unlike competitors in the workshop, who shyly glue the glue and are still trying to squeeze all the juices from the 14 nm technology, which translates into a ‚Äúrevolutionary‚Äù increase of 300 MHz frequency per core, AMD is ‚Äúwalking‚Äù extremely widely.  Here is a short list of tasty new products that consumers will get with the new three-thousand Ryzen based on Zen 2:

    <ul><li>  7 nm; </li><li>  PCI-e 4.0; </li><li>  the new X570 chipset; </li><li>  backward compatibility with old motherboards AM4; </li><li>  two ‚Äúcold‚Äù processors with 65 W TDP for those who like silence; </li><li>  extremely adequate cost. </li></ul><br>  And all this is already on sale since 07.07.2019.  And now let's tell more. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Somehow, historically, we used to look at AMD as the eternal "catching up" company Intel.  AMD processors have always been famous for their monstrous temperature conditions, which even <a href="">became a meme at some point</a> .  However, the presentation of AMD that took place this weekend showed that Intel's positions were seriously shaken and AMD is ready to take a leading position in the market of consumer processors for desktop PCs. <br><br>  As part of the presentation, five new Ryzen processors of the three thousand series were presented to the public: Ryzen 3600, Ryzen 3600X, Ryzen 3700, Ryzen 3800X and the new flagship of the company - Ryzen 3900X. <br><br>  Of the most important, 7 nm technical process is worth noting (Intel is still running 14 nm), the new Zen 2 architecture, which was previously actively used only for server ‚Äústones‚Äù, as well as support for PCI-e 4.0 on the new X570 chipset. <br><br>  Here is a brief description of the characteristics of the new line of processors from AMD: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wb/3u/36/wb3u36r0mioulu8kozqcxg84l-c.png"><br><br>  The frequencies of AMD's ‚Äústones‚Äù range from 3.6 to 3.9 GHz in the drain state to 4.2-4.6 GHz in boost mode.  The minimum number of cores is 6, the flagship Ryzen 3900X has all 12 on board. <br><br>  It is also important that one of the ‚Äúmedium‚Äù models, the Ryzen 3700X, has a TDP of 65 W, which is quite comparable in terms of heat generation to the competitor‚Äôs regular desktop processors.  Thus, fans of silence and lazy operation of the cooling system received an acceptable processor from AMD. <br><br>  The most interesting is, of course, the new flagship of the company - the Ryzen 3900X.  This 12-core processor with a 105-watt TDP is called a direct competitor to one of Intel‚Äôs top consumer processors.  This is not about the i9-9900K, as some might have thought, but about the gaming processor from the Extreme line - i9-9920X.  The top-end i9-9900K competitor claims the pre-top Ryzen 3800X.  It is important to note that the recommended retail price for the i9-9900K starts at $ 489-499 per item, when, as AMD, they plan to sell their Ryzen 3800X at $ 399. <br><br>  The cost of the Ryzen 3900X will be comparable to that for the i9-9900K: the new flagship AMD will sell for $ 499.  However, the Ryzen 3900X is positioned as a direct competitor to the i9-9920X, the recommended retail price of which, according to data <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/processors/core/x-series/i9-9920x.html">on the official Intel website</a> , is from $ 1199. <br><br>  That is, a new <b>AMD processor with</b> comparable performance and more modern technologies <b>will be almost 2.5 times cheaper than</b> its direct competitor.  At the same time, AMD Liza Sue, the CEO of AMD, right from the stage presented the performance of the Ryzen 3900X 14% higher in single-threaded mode and 6% in multi-threaded mode. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/7v/ww/8g/7vww8gnzwppydwpe1wn9tjqon8a.png"><br><br>  Surprisingly, even the TDP parameter for the Ryzen 3900X is 60 watts lower, and knowing Intel's manipulations with this indicator (Intel's TDP always indicates a ‚Äúbasic‚Äù mode without Turbo, that is, the actual heat dissipation of the processor can be twice as high), AMD's new processor "Rips" a competitor, even for this indicator. <br><br>  The cherry on the AMD presentation cake was a humane attitude towards consumers and the backward compatibility of the new Ryzen with the old AM4 socket motherboards.  Of course, to fully function and unleash the full potential of new AMD products, you will need a motherboard with a new X570 chipset, but the ability to buy a new ‚Äústone‚Äù and insert it into an existing motherboard ‚Äî thus avoiding the need for large one-time expenses for upgrading the platform ‚Äî that's fine.  In the case of Intel's LGA 1151v2, everything did not turn out so beautifully. <br><br>  And Intel seems to have tried to ‚Äúbrush off‚Äù AMD from the presentation of its tenth generation of Ice Lake processors in 10-nm increments, but there are three big ‚Äúbuts‚Äù.  First: AMD showed desktop user processors at 7 nm.  Second, the Intel generation processors presented by Ice Lake are low-power <s>Intel Atom for netbook</s> processors for mobile devices with a TDP of 7-15 W and corresponding performance.  And third: these processors will be available only by the end of the year, when the new Ryzen ships on July 7th.  So there is nothing for Intel to cover. <br><br>  If in the next year Intel does not offer something fundamentally new in order to rehabilitate itself, even the hardened Intel fanboys will begin to consider the option of switching to competitor processors, which six or seven years ago except as contemptuous ‚Äúbraziers for the poor‚Äù and ‚Äúelectric waffles‚Äù not called. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/453860/">https://habr.com/ru/post/453860/</a></p>
