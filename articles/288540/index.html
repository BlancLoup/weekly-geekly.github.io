Mostly due to a three-day weekend.  My grandmother told me, when the USSR moved from a six-day working week to a five-day one, labor productivity dropped sharply, although, in theory, it should have increased.  People just did not have time to recover by the first working day after two days of heavy libations.  In Europe, at this time, rolling blackouts across the continent, and on the forum of the all-galactic newspaper - calls for the creation of a union of IT-journalists.  And what about blogs?

      Of course, the main event of the last weekend was the non-working state of livejournal.com, and in a simple way - LJ.  On Saturday, many bloggers could not read the friend tape and leave entries in their own diaries.  And at first there was no information at all about what was going on, and the majority of Russian-speaking users again began to recall with unkind words the company ‚ÄúSoup‚Äù, about which I dealt with Six Apart in previous issues of the review.  Moreover, it was at this time that the so-called Russian March was held in Moscow and some people decided that this was not a coincidence.  Finally, in the afternoon, users were able to read the message that the failure was due to a power outage at a data center in California.  Moreover, it was especially emphasized that LJ did not work all over the world, and not only in Russia.  In this regard, let's read the comments of Anton Nosik, ex-president of Rambler Internet Holding, creator of Lenta.ru, Vesti.ru, NewsRu.om and Gazeta.ru, currently responsible for LJ in the company ‚ÄúSoup‚Äù.  Let me remind you that Anton has his own blog at <a href="http://dolboeb.livejournal.com/">dolboeb.livejournal.com</a> . <br><br>  <strong>Comment of the week</strong> <br><br>  <em>After the announcement of the deal, the Russian-language Internet was overwhelmed with hysteria and predictions of a speedy apocalypse.</em>  <em>You, Anton, are represented in these messages by the antichrist and the embodiment of world capitalist evil.</em>  <em>For example, many immediately suggested that you take advantage of the power and first remove the diaries of opponents.</em>  <em>It is clear that such a development of events can only come true in fantastic action movies.</em>  <em>Why do you think we are so keenly disliked when something belongs to someone?</em> <br><br>  If you start to deal with the protests, it turns out one important fact.  People willing to say out loud at least ‚Äúphi‚Äù - 0.6% of the number of Russian-speaking users.  And there were no three people out of 700,000 who were ready to remove their magazine as a sign of protest.  Therefore, I would not overestimate the significance of protest actions.  There are very different people who, in one way or another, spoke out negatively: anti-Semites, russophobes, paranoids, and sane people.  The latter, however, ask questions, get answers and leave the ranks of the protesters. <br><br>  <em>Are you really going to enslave the world?</em> <br><br>  Only its Cyrillic part. <br><br>  <em>Is any separate support service possible for Belarusian bloggers?</em> <br><br>  I have never heard in my life that they needed her.  That is, I have no data on the demand for such a service.  And I can not imagine what she could do. <br><br>  <em>Will ‚ÄúSoup‚Äù implement its own software in the Cyrillic segment of the network or in this segment you do not interfere?</em>  <em>Generally, what is meant by "license for service"?</em> <br><br>  We have the right to implement our own services in LiveJournal - for example, integrate LJPlus service belonging to ‚ÄúSoup‚Äù into the LiveJournal interface. <br><br>  <em>On Friday and Saturday, LiveJournal showed no signs of life.</em>  <em>Many immediately suggested that ‚ÄúSoup‚Äù was directly related to this.</em>  <em>It is clear that the servers are in America, but will Cyrillic diaries be transferred to Russian servers in the future?</em> <br><br>  Elements of the design and LJ code will be transferred to the Russian (and not only) servers, which will speed up the loading of pages for users outside the United States every six times.  Of course, there is no desire to make LJ vulnerable to Russian power structures.  Brad Fitzpatrick, who is engaged in the architecture of Russian mirrors, understands the nature of totalitarian threats and promises to take them into account when designing. <br><br>  <em>You yourself are not tired of blogs and the Internet?</em> <br><br>  When the Internet bothers me, I will de-energize it and close it.  :) <br><br>  <em>In order to relax a little (imagine how many times you have had to answer questions about ‚ÄúSoup‚Äù lately), I want to ask, if it doesn‚Äôt make it difficult, to talk about how you saw a computer for the first time in your life and how impressive it was.</em>  <em>I think it will be interesting to many.</em> <br><br>  I saw a computer for the first time from my friend Ilya Medkov, who was one of the first to start importing them into the USSR.  It was at the end of 1987.  And in early 1988, I illegally traveled to West Berlin and there I bought myself my first pisyuk. <br><br>  <strong>Belarus of the week</strong> <br><br>  In our country, perhaps, the main event of the week was the opening of a corporate blog on <a href="http://blog.onliner.by/">Online</a> .  Naturally, the blog immediately caused a stir around him.  Firstly, it seems rather strange to turn off comments.  We are politely hinted that our comment will not appear on the blog and will be forwarded to the author by e-mail.  Moreover, such austerity is not explained in any way, and that‚Äôs just not possible.  But the comments - this is one of the main features of the blog.  Sometimes comments are even more informative than the message itself!  Secondly, personally, I would like to see more local information in the blog - about life inside ‚ÄúOnline‚Äù, about the situation in the mobile world of Belarus, because ‚ÄúOnline‚Äù employs people who are simply obliged to understand this well.  Naturally, for comments on the opening of the blog, I turned to Alexander Stelmakh, the chief editor of the site, and this is what I received in response: <br><br>  <em>Why was it taking so long to open a blog?</em>  <em>Trite there was no time, or did you think that blogs were a frivolous occupation of graffiti teenagers?</em> <br><br>  We treat blogs with deep respect, and in no case do we consider them ‚Äúfrivolous‚Äù.  Of course, there are exceptions - but it is easy to find adolescent teenagers in other areas of the Internet, for example, in the same forums.  In addition, you should separate personal blogs and corporate blogs.  The latter can in no way be associated with ‚Äúgraphomania.‚Äù  As for the date of appearance of the corporate blog Onliner, it was created in full accordance with the schedule approved some time ago.  I want to emphasize that the corporate blog Onliner is a serious project that will organically complement the other content of the site. <br><br>  <em>What engine does the blog run on?</em> <br><br>  The blog runs on WordPress. <br><br>  <em>Why WordPress?</em> <br><br>  Because it is a convenient and popular solution.  However, the appearance of the blog was the result of the painstaking work of our own experts. <br><br>  <em>Many were disappointed by the lack of opportunity to leave comments on your blog.</em>  <em>Agree to send letters to the author instead of a quick comment contradicts the very concept of blogs.</em>  <em>Of course, your unwillingness to clean the blog from flooding and curses is also understandable.</em>  <em>And yet, is it worth waiting for the inclusion of comments at least sometime?</em> <br><br>  We receive very high quality and interesting comments from our readers - we enter into correspondence with many.  Some questions from them will be reflected in our future posts on the Onliner blog.  We conceived the blog as a kind of "editor column", but in this case - extended.  For two-way communication is enough forums. <br><br>  <em>Who will write to your blog?</em>  <em>Do all the portal employees or only a few people have this opportunity?</em>  <em>While the blog noted two - except for you, this is Vitaly Shuravko.</em>  <em>How long did you have to search for a topic?</em> <br><br>  There are a lot of topics for messages.  The blog will post messages onliner key employees.  The blog was conceived not least so that users could become better acquainted with our creative team. <br><br>  <em>Will we see informal photos from the life of Onliner on your blog?</em> <br><br>  We will make every effort to make our blog interesting as an autonomous project.  As for informal photos, Onliner regularly organizes or sponsors a variety of events, including entertaining ones, so there are plenty of informal photos without a blog. <br><br>  <strong>And at this time ...</strong> <br><br>  ... Google has been developing software to create and publish content on the Internet.  Jotspot‚Äôs chief executive of Jotspot, a system collaborator, said that the audience of users of various Google services outnumbered Wikipedia fans, which would make it possible to bring the published information to a much larger number of readers.  In addition, for sure JotSpot wants to look into the user base of Google - the cherished goal of any manager of Internet services.  In combination with the upcoming acquisition of a successful YouTube startup by Google, the agreement with JotSpot looks like a preparation for the launch of a large-scale and multifunctional blog service.  Moreover, it is more than likely that it will be integrated with the popular Google Mail and Google Calendar gaining momentum.  All this I learned on the website of the magazine " <a href="http://www.mobimag.ru/News/2648/Google-JotSpot-Wiki-blog.htm">Mobi</a> ". <br><br>  ... in the blog of Jan Vladimirovich, a wonderful post ‚ÄúThe <a href="http://www.vladimirovich.livejournal.com/238680.html">Art of Go * nography</a> ‚Äù appeared, which is dedicated to novice geniuses of photographers.  As they say, very instructive.  Here is a quote: ‚ÄúThe photo‚Äú Dog-dog Kuzya ‚Äùis included in the series of pictures‚Äú The Village ‚Äùincluded in the block‚Äú Summer ‚Äù, which is part of the project‚Äú The Seasons ‚Äùof the creative period‚Äú New Life ‚Äù.  No one will check that the creative period of ‚ÄúNew Life‚Äù lasted from Thursday to Saturday, and it includes three photos: ‚ÄúDog Dog Kuzya‚Äù and two more photos that were accidentally erased ‚Äù. <br><br>  ... on the <a href="http://www.habrahabr.ru/lenta/1436">Habrahabr</a> website (by the way, I recommend paying special attention to this resource), it is reported that Microsoft has opened the <a href="http://beta.communities.microsoft.com/tagspace">Tagspace beta</a> service, with which visitors of Microsoft.com can tag the pages of the site they need.  This is Microsoft‚Äôs attempt to ‚Äúintegrate into the Web 2.0 sphere‚Äù and create additional convenience for the community that has evolved around the company's website.  Like del.icio.us, each user can mark the page he needs with one or more tags.  For the convenience of tracking new ‚Äútagged‚Äù pages, RSS feeds are created for each tag. <br><br>  ... the blog on drugoi <a href="http://www.drugoi.livejournal.com/1994996.html">publishes</a> an article about the only private submarine in Russia.  The length is five meters, the power reserve is from Petersburg to Helsinki and back.  Her first voyage nearly ended for the designer with a prison.  But instead, he was sent to study at the shipbuilding institute. <br><br>  ... in his blog, Lucas <a href="http://www.un-tal-lukas.livejournal.com/1462728.html">admits</a> how he underestimated the anime.  As always, the quote: ‚Äú <em>Many familiar girls honestly signed their stupidity and stuck to the TV, just as this Sailor ibn Moon appeared on the screen and began to do good and justice in the name of the Moon, without sparing anyone around. But I was smart So clever that, after seeing several episodes in secret, she issued a general verdict on Japanese animation, its fans, and all of humanity (for the company) - ‚Äúshoot!</em> ‚Äù. <br><br>  ... Archpriest Alexander (yes, the clergy also keep blogs) <a href="http://www.rebrik.livejournal.com/110345.html">publishes an</a> interesting document that tells a lot about church life in 1964. <br><br>  For today, all the guys.  Write letters, read blogs, hamsters! <br><br>  <strong>Alexey Kaletsky</strong> <br><br>  <a href="http://kv.by/index2006450601.htm">Published in "Computer News" (‚Ññ45, 2006)</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/288540/">https://habr.com/ru/post/288540/</a></p>
