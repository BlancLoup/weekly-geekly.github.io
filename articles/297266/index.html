In parallel with the struggle "online flea markets" had time to emerge, develop and die the market of coupon sites.  For a long time there are free and paid freelance exchanges that are developing quite successfully.  Amid this variety of low-cost consumer options, something was missing.  It was not interesting to create the next service where the request and the answer to it will find each other.  Therefore, we have identified for ourselves a range of tasks that should solve such services. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  For a start, we chose the requirements that users and partners make to such services.  It was a big list, in it we identified a few critical moments that may be useful in the design and other projects of a social orientation. <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Completeness of the description of the need.</b>  Requests for services often lack relevant details and key data.  This impedes the speedy provision of the service, since it is necessary to clarify the order parameters.  We need forms, filling in which, the user will not forget about important trifles, and the forms need to be worked out taking into account industry specifics. <br><br></li><li>  <b>Control of payment and order execution.</b>  This tool is necessary to account for funds received, confidence in the past payment and payment of taxes, if required by law.  In Bonjoin's personal account, you can take into account the money earned on the provision of services and see the payments.

    </li><li>  <b>Terms of service applications.</b>  If the client works directly with one performer, the deadlines may be delayed, since there is no competition.  The principle of the auction, which we used in Bonjoin, not only reduces the price, but also reduces the time required to complete the application. <br><br></li><li>  <b>Execution price of the application</b>  In the case of several performers, it is determined during the auction.  In addition, in some forms, the customer can specify the price that is acceptable for himself, thereby cutting off unnecessary offers that are not ready to close an application at a specified price. <br><br></li><li>  <b>Low threshold for entering the site.</b>  A site that claims to be a universal portal for interaction between customers and performers should include simple registration and quick access to creating or viewing an application.  It is better to collect all the necessary details later, in your personal account. <br><br></li><li>  <b>Reliability partners.</b>  The site, of course, is not capable of being responsible for each performer.  However, a self-regulation mechanism is in place: in the event of a contractor‚Äôs rating falling or complaints are received, the agreement with the partner may be terminated unilaterally. </li></ul><br>  Having collected the requirements, we created a platform.  Gradually, we realized that it turned out really what we lacked in the market of fast and low-cost services, and maybe even a little more.  As a result, we identified several blocks of opportunities for Bonjoin clients and partners. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">By the way, until you forget, we have a competition and a drawing of the iPhone 6S</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  On the eve of the New Year Bonjoin.com gives gifts to all participants, and everyone gets a chance to win an Iphone 6S smartphone. <br><br>  For this you need: <br><ul><li>  Login to Bonjoin.com </li><li>  To register </li><li>  Send a link to Bonjoin.com to your friends. </li></ul><br>  For each attracted friend, you will receive 300 rubles to your virtual account.  They can then be spent on partial payment for services ordered through Bonjoin.com. <br><br>  The 100 most active users who will attract the most friends will take part in the drawing of the main prize - Iphone 6S! <br><br>  Registration in the competition <a href="http://www.bonjoin.com/login/contest">here</a> <br><br>  If you want to register your company and take part in the competition, you are <a href="http://www.bonjoin.com/login/partner">here</a> <br><br>  If you want to provide services on the site and take part in the competition, then you <a href="http://www.bonjoin.com/login/worker">here</a> <br></div></div><br><h2> <font color="#cc5500"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9c7/c89/701/9c7c897012fa459ab00352159dd90b86.png"></font>  <font color="#cc5500">"Service Bureau"</font> </h2><br>  So we sometimes call <b><a href="http://www.bonjoin.com/">Bonjoin</a></b> , although this definition is not quite true.  The initial goal of the portal is to help individuals find products and services at minimal prices and with guaranteed quality.  The idea was simple: the user leaves a request through a special form, the application is transferred to partner companies that offer the service.  The user selects the most suitable solution for the price and set of parameters.  Everyone is happy: the service is rendered, and the company has easily and quite inexpensively attracted a client.  At the same time, we paid special attention to the adjustment from different types of coupon sites: we do not place discounts, we place needs.  And how to best implement them - the concern of companies. <br><br>  We designed BonJoin so that the search for the contractor takes little time - 80% of orders receive more than 3 offers within 30 minutes, and the ordering itself takes about 2 minutes and is absolutely free.  To place an order in any field, we have provided unique, thoughtful forms - the user has no chance to forget to provide relevant information.  As a rule, more than one executor answers the request; therefore, bidding for an order in the form of an auction occurs and the final cost for the customer is reduced.  In the process of working with clients, each performer is assigned a rating, which determines a pool of reliable contractors.  To date, about 85,000 partners have been registered in the BonJoin system and a significant number of orders have been completed. <br><br><h2> <font color="#cc5500"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9c7/c89/701/9c7c897012fa459ab00352159dd90b86.png"></font>  <font color="#cc5500">Agent Networks</font> </h2><br>  At one of the conferences on sales in the IT sector, a fair opinion was expressed that one of the best distribution channels is dealer or agent networks.  In fact, if you look at the experience of Russian and foreign giants (1C, Abbyy, Microsoft, etc.), you can see that partner networks for them have become a powerful distribution channel.  However, modern markets are highly competitive in almost any niche and it is quite difficult to build an agent network.  Among the most common reasons for the difficulty of building partner networks is the lack of a tool for accounting and calculating with partners.  This should be either custom development or a ready-made specialized expensive system with a built-in personal account and integration with payment systems. <br><br>  The Bonjoin team solved this problem.  Legal entities can create their affiliate network in our application.  We, in turn, guarantee the safety and integrity of user data.  About how and why we thought about the security of the project, you can read in our blog on Habr√©.  While users can not see this opportunity, but we will realize it at the first request for partnership.  It is assumed that the company invites agents itself or they send requests, thus, an agent pool is formed.  After that, the company will be able to place requests only for its list, and list participants will be able to attract customers for this company by generating requests for its services.  Such a scheme may be suitable, for example, to travel or insurance companies, as well as vendors of corporate or custom software.  All payments will be recorded in the personal account of the parties. <br><br><h2> <font color="#cc5500"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9c7/c89/701/9c7c897012fa459ab00352159dd90b86.png"></font>  <font color="#cc5500">B2B help</font> </h2><br>  A business of any size constantly needs something: stationery, furniture, business cards, flyers, rolls, cuttings, a sea of ‚Äã‚Äãsouvenirs and so on ... And often such orders arise suddenly and should be closed as soon as possible.  As a rule, telephone calls to the executive companies are unproductive according to the directory - it is impossible to get into a company with short deadlines, acceptable quality and an optimal price.  Sometimes closed urban professional online communities solve the problem, but as the audience analysis shows, they are also a thing of the past. <br><br>  Within the <a href="http://www.bonjoin.com/">Bonjoin</a> portal, <a href="http://www.bonjoin.com/">you</a> can place an order for manufacturing products or providing services for businesses.  But it will be answered by several companies that are aware that competition and ordering will have to be answered on the site.  That is, the most interested companies will answer.  The customer will only have to choose an artist and discuss the details.  Using Bonjoin service in this case provides not only the client, but also the speed of execution and low cost relative to the market. <br><br><h2> <font color="#cc5500"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9c7/c89/701/9c7c897012fa459ab00352159dd90b86.png"></font>  <font color="#cc5500">Outsourced staff</font> </h2><br>  Remote work or outsourcing is becoming more common due to advanced communication networks.  Why not use Bonjoin for their officially employed employees, especially since the portal even provides for tax deductions.  Small companies that want to save on accounting systems can use the portal as a personnel management system, create applications for work on one or more lists, pay wages.  In turn, employees will be able to independently control pay through a personal account.  In addition, companies can form my personnel reserve from among private performers registered on the Bonjoin portal.  Of course, the portal provides for the possibility of working with freelancers - you can leave a request, which will be answered by private individuals. <br><br>  This approach has many benefits: <br><br><ul><li>  savings on corporate software </li><li>  competitiveness of transactions, and therefore, the struggle for higher quality at a low price </li><li>  controllability of all payments, including wages and taxes </li><li>  quick access to order history </li><li>  the ability to store portfolios and documents within the portal. </li></ul><br>  The schemes described are only basic Bonjoin usage models.  We are at the beginning of our journey and are open to suggestions, so new options for interacting with the service are constantly in development.  Usually they say ‚ÄúNice to meet you‚Äù, we speak in accordance with our name.  Bonjoin, nice to join! <br><br>  PS: Well, once again about the pleasant.  All companies spend under the new year promotions.  We were offended that our specificity, at first glance, does not dispose to large-scale promo.  But this is only at first glance.  Therefore, we offer to get low-cost and high-quality services of our partners and try your luck in our New Year's Eve competition.  All the details are on <a href="http://www.bonjoin.com/login/contest">the promotion page</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/297266/">https://habr.com/ru/post/297266/</a></p>
