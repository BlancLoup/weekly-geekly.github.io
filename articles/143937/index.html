Somehow it went the same way from the beginning with iPhones, when I ignored both 3G versions, switching from the first iPhone to the quad, it also happened with the iPad.  The very first iPad lasted until just last week, and last year he lived with a hefty crack across the entire screen, which for some reason did not irritate me at all, but, on the contrary, gave the device some kind of steampunk charm. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  But in general, somehow it was time to move and I went for an upgrade.  Wait until the dealers at New Aypad were cheaper to be lazy, so I decided to still learn ebay, especially since I had been wanting for a long time.  The problem with the agility of trade and the American address was simply solved with the help of ebaytoday.ru, which I will not deny myself the pleasure of publishing freehand.  Of course, the percentage could be lower, but on the whole, the price advantage relative to the second-hand dealers is quite decent, and the fact that they check what they bought in the United States makes it possible to be somehow a little more relaxed relative to the kicker.  And me, sobsna, it just soared. <br><br>  In short, the mail works, you know how, but in general, the package wrapped up to me, I picked up a new device, and in general, this is where all the interesting things ended :-)

      In theory, for me, rolling over from a device two years ago, there were going to be a lot of wonderful discoveries.  Let's face it, the discoveries did not happen.  Retina probably should delight me, but it is on my iPhone and my eyes are completely used to it.  Yes, the picture is awesome, moreover, I appreciate Retinu not at all where it is customary to value it in advertising articles, but I appreciate the fact itself.  The sound has really become better, but in general it does not shine, nor does it shine.  No special functionality seems to be added, except for the fact that this time I have a device with a sim card, that is, in theory, I am not tied to a wifi. <br><br>  This is very good, but there is one small problem - I already had some pattern of behavior with an ipad, so when I want to read mail in the city or check something on the network, I still go for an iPhone, but I‚Äôve got in the same way there is an ipad I remember only later.  I really hope that the iPad will help me on trips abroad, because rearranging the SIM card in the phone is equivalent to losing calls to the main phone, well, or not calls that can be transferred, and SMS, but still inconvenient.  And with the iPad, you are not tied to the number and you can afford to rearrange the SIM cards as much as you like, getting the Internet not on hellish roaming. <br><br>  The second joy that awaits me jumping through the model - for me the weight of the iPad hasn't changed at all ;-) I remember how people said that the second iPad seems to be quite a bit lighter in grams, and what's the difference in feelings, so they probably have a bummer that he is now HEAVY.  And for me it is normal, if there is a difference, then I practically do not feel it. <br><br>  And in general, all with joy.  More powerful processor?  Yes, I had nothing before.  More powerful battery?  Probably about me, he both worked the day, the night of exercise, and continues.  Speaking frankly - it would be possible not to go too much.  Unfortunately, the main innovation of the model, LTE is not applicable :-( <br><br>  And finally, I want to share a special opinion about retina.  In my personal, strongly biased taste, the most important place where she plays is the iBook.  Reading from the screen with the retina is very close to what I would like to see from devices of this kind.  I know that nature is full of all sorts of devices, which would seem to be much steeper than reading, there are electronic ink and tricky displays.  But in fact it is most pleasant for me to read from the iPad.  Somehow it happened. <br><br>  And MANDATORY look at the retina Sin City.  Holding revived comics in your hands is not at all like looking at how they come to life on the screen, especially in a quality that is close to printing. <br><br>  Something like this </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/143937/">https://habr.com/ru/post/143937/</a></p>
