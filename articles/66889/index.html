  <section class="page js-page"><h1>QIWI</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Recently, I wanted to put money on a Yota account, and put it.  Only now the money in the account was not.  A check I did not give the terminal.  I had to call all sorts of technical support.  The very first technical support guys found my payment and told me all the necessary data and offered to call back to QIWI directly, where my first “personal assistant” greeted me.  “My personal assistant” said that my payment went through everything in their system that he had to go through and recommended to call back to Yota.  After 10 minutes of tedious music, I had a girlfriend who, after listening to my stories about how the payment failed, said that my payment was not visible and she did not know what to do:) ... I grinned and called back to QIWI, this time I was told , they don’t see anything at all, and only after I told them all the data about this payment and that they don’t see the payment in Yota, they again told me to call Yota.  In Yota, I told all the account data, but I didn’t answer the secret question because even the person who came up with this answer forgot it himself, and they refused to tell me anything at all.  I decided to call QIWI again and this time I got a very good “my personal assistant”, who talked to me very pleasantly and said that just in case she would write an application for my payment receipt, took my phone and said goodbye.  I forgot about the problem for two days, Yota is simply not mine, and it is hardly used, so it’s good that I did it all.  On the third day I remembered that they should call me.  I called back to QIWI and they said that yes, there is a request, wait for someone to contact you, I wondered how long, and I was told that no one had such information and hung up.  Two days later he called again, gave an address for the post and hung up again.  Now I sit and think to write a malicious letter or a good one ... I wonder what will respond sooner. <br>  <strong>UPD:</strong> Thanks to a friend of <a href="http://efads.habrahabr.ru/">efads,</a> my problem was resolved, thanks to him a lot.  Yota accepted the application and promised to deposit money in two days.  By the way it turned out that I was wrong in the water numbers.  You can replenish your account: <ol><li>  Enter the account number from the card that starts with 1 </li><li>  by entering the account number that starts with 2 </li><li>  by entering a mobile number </li></ol>  It was here that there was another snag.  In the instructions on the terminal there is a line about “Enter the account number as 7 XXX XXX XX XX”, well, or something like that, so I entered the personal account number with the seven in front, and the seven in front is placed only in the third case.  Thanks to all. </div>
