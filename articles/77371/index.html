In the future, by 2015, it is planned to build a specialized high-speed highway St. Petersburg - Moscow with a maximum speed of <strong>350-400 km / h</strong> and a travel time of 2 hours and 30 minutes. </blockquote>

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  So, in order not to turn an article into a long not very interesting set of specific railway problems, I will try to explain in human language the principle of organizing satellite navigation on the railway. <br><br>  Railways conceived terrible.  Minimize human personnel engaged in managing train traffic. <br>  In order to ensure high-speed traffic, it is necessary to quickly and smoothly receive and make decisions related to the management of train movement. <br>  Who can solve complex problems as quickly as possible, analyzing a lot of input data?  That's right - the <strong>car</strong> . <br><br><h2>  Auto Dispatcher </h2><br>  And so was born autocontroller - Software and hardware complex of automatic train control. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e54/5c2/80f/e545c280f631a92f2441e4045480e72b.jpg" alt="car dispatcher"><br>  How does he work: <br>  Information from a variety of railway infrastructure facilities is being processed by the auto-dispatcher complex. <br>  There is a software processing of all input data, and if something requires the response of a live controller, the information is displayed on a collective scoreboard measuring 12.5 meters by 2 meters, reflecting the train position and the state of the entire infrastructure of the course. <br><br>  For example, somewhere the contact wire of the network breaks - immediately information about this is displayed on the board. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/046/87d/34f/04687d34f77d224a07caac7530b978dc.jpg" alt="image"><br>  But the sense of the auto-dispatcher is not only in the collection of statistical information, it would be too far from our GLONASS theme and movement automation. <br><br><blockquote>  For "Sapsan" even three minutes late are unacceptable.  The same requirements should apply to other fast trains.  Computer technologies make it possible to assess the situation 80‚Äì90 km in advance, so that you can quickly make a decision on the resulting emergency situation. <br>  In the locomotive on electronic media there is data on energy-saving graphics, which allows the most efficient use of the profile, slopes <br>  paths, braking, acceleration, etc.  In the automatic mode, the computer also evaluates the implementation of the schedule.  Tests have shown that if an emergency situation does not arise along the way, a fast train can pass through the section Moscow - St. Petersburg without interfering with the driver‚Äôs control.  And the deviation from the schedule will be no more than 30-40 seconds.  The second stage is the transition to the ‚ÄúRobot‚Äù system.  Computer is difficult to replace a person, but it can help very significantly.  Especially where there are many solutions to the problem.  No matter how well we did the technique, <br>  nor contained infrastructure, an emergency situation can always occur.  How to organize the movement to travel with minimal delay and at the same time save energy?  Choose the best solution will be a computer.  Drawing up a similar program for him is the task of the current year. <br></blockquote><br><br>  One of the functions of the auto-dispatcher in the automatic observance of the schedule of the Executive Movement (GID) and the regulation of train traffic <br>  I was surprised to learn that competent management of the composition (acceleration, deceleration) reduces annual energy consumption by tens of millions of rubles. <br>  That is, the auto-dispatcher will be directly involved in the train behavior on the section, can control its speed, as well as the state of switches.  Those.  autocontroller will route.  Of course, the driver from the train will not disappear, although in the future he will practically not take part in the movement of the train. <br><br><h2>  GLONASS </h2><br>  And this is where GLONASS comes into play. <br>  Now for determining the location of the structure, signaling systems installed on the road are used.  However, the accuracy of positioning is not sufficient for operational and constant control over the movement of the train.  For this, the trains will be equipped with GLONASS receivers, which will transmit the coordinate-time position on the composition by digital radio communication of the TETRA standard.  And on the basis of these data, the auto dispatcher will work in terms of traffic control. <br><br>  It is worth noting that this is not global know-how, of course, the experience of foreign colleagues was used, in particular Germany, where a similar system works at Deutsche-Ban.  But the specifics of domestic railways demanded serious research. <br><br><h2>  And what is the profit? </h2><br>  Of course, besides the very possibility of organizing and managing high-speed traffic, there are economic indicators. <br><blockquote>  Even today, energy savings from driving on energy-saving graphics are 4‚Äì5.5%, or 41‚Äì45 million rubles.  in year.  In addition, there are certain proposals for the phased transfer of 12‚Äì15 stations from those available at station 48 to deserted technology.  Automating the functions of the dispatching personnel on duty will make it possible to reduce the apparatus at the line level, minimize the influence of the human factor, and increase the traffic safety of trains.  The expected economic effect of this event will be 45-50 million rubles.  And finally, any emergency can be resolved at minimal cost.  The introduction of a conflict resolution program will also bring a certain economic effect. <br></blockquote><br><br>  If we talk about what I will be directly involved in - it is the organization of a system for notifying passengers at stations and stopping points of this section.  And we will also help us Auto Dispatcher, because  he is calculating the estimated time of arrival of the train at all subsequent stations.  We will display this information on LED displays and notify passengers on the speakerphone.  So the innovation is definitely useful, as long as the budget is mastered ... <br><br><h2>  As PS </h2><br>  I‚Äôm still eager to write a topic about designing a passenger warning system, but there‚Äôs still no time to allocate. <br>  As a starter, I‚Äôll just give you an approximate price level for construction and installation work - the average station equipped with 2‚Äì3 LED boards and a couple of dozen SMR speakers will be about 20 million rubles. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/77371/">https://habr.com/ru/post/77371/</a></p>
