  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Why is your GTD ineffective?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I am an ordinary office worker.  That is, hired, but on the territory of the payer and on its terms.  Yes, even signed on this cunning standard employment contract: "I perform functional duties + orders of the leadership (usually - all nonsense, with my professions associated weakly)."  In general, I lead a way of life that is familiar to many of us, and which is very difficult for most to change with the click of a finger.  And while I did not break into nirvana, the weak question arose: how could I live more comfortably in such bondage.  The answer was a little philosophical, a little economic, a little psychological, but it is.  And it is criminal to hide it. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Note: entertainment for a cause-and-effect relationship is shown backwards.  That's more interesting. <br><br>  1. <b>Time management in the office does not work.</b>  You can organize the processing of incoming tasks, but not control their appearance, number and types.  You are a mercenary - that is, a pen for which, if necessary, twist those who are supposed to.  The handle somehow does not know when it will start to turn, how skillful and for how long.  The level of accessibility is expected to be equal to 99.9999% and the efficiency at loads close to the maximum, it is desirable that it be higher.  Then the pen is valued, remembered and not written off for scrap at the very first swing of the business‚Äôs boards as not the most critical tool.  The handle of this is calmer.  Although they often rub everything that is possible with her ... So, the work itself in the office is difficult to manage and chaotic by definition.  The definition in this case is the type of employment itself.  The freelancer in this sense potentially more or less manages the tasks - he may simply not take on some of them or outsource.

      2. <b>The most important thing in the office is to be in touch</b> .  <i>This is the reason for the appearance of p. 1.</i> Try to get away, and the chief called you to ask what a ‚Äúbifurcation‚Äù is, but you did not pick up the phone with the first beep.  Everything.  Disloyal.  Award to cut.  And do not care that the rest 99% of the time at work you have nowhere more loyal, sincerely plow and your plow shines like a mirror when others have a glare.  And as if you are not to blame.  After all, the situation is the same: you as a resource are required during the appetite, and when appetite comes in and how many people it is almost impossible to predict.  How many man-hours does it take to return to the problem that is being pondered after the next call ‚Äúcan you speak - without waiting - I have a short question - {unimportant primitive garbage} - thanks, buddy‚Äù?  Yes, in fact, 50-80%.  We all know that you can successfully work in silence when alone with yourself.  At the entrance - a list of tasks, in front of you are hands with rolled up sleeves, at the exit - plowed up virgin and pleasant tired. <br><br>  3. <b>In the office, nobody cares about anyone.</b>  I mean, no matter who is doing what.  Because you can always go / call / write soap / invite to the carpet / gather a meeting.  When the resource is near - it is easy to reach it.  <i>Therefore, the rule of clause 2 appears.</i> And since he signed an employment contract, ‚Äúreach out to me within the bounds of official duties and not only‚Äù, voila - all the legs are not too lazy.  This is the strength and weakness of the economy of shared labor.  No, well, on the other hand, resources can get lost in groups, teams (most often spontaneously) and the office contributes here, but it‚Äôs like the balance of Yin and Yang - among themselves in the group all exist synergistically, but they pull each one separately in the case and not in the case anyway. <br><br>  4. <b>The division of labor - the basis of organizational chaos in the office.</b>  Of course, how else.  What lawyers are busy with - bukh it is impossible to understand.  The business executives, it turns out, are doing business important, removing solid household waste from Tajiks (‚Äúwe save on fines ‚Äî give a premium ‚Äî how good we are‚Äù and not perform their duties), cleaners ‚Äî wash them with ‚Äúwhat they gave out‚Äù (and do not steal consumables because they are paid little, because they will steal, because they are paid little), the general director does not fuck everyone‚Äôs brain with his iPhone, but supervises (calls to his uncle or a classmate and punches another contract to ‚Äúfeed all the parasites‚Äù ) and so on.  Did you notice?  The role and its performance are different from the ideal because hell who understands what you are doing around.  There is no control.  That's because outside the group of people speaking the same language with you you are a free person.  Just be in touch and let's twist your pen.  The rest do not know what you are doing.  <i>Wati appears paragraph 3.</i> But this is half the problem - mutual accusations sprout on such grounds, ‚Äúfootball‚Äù is to blame for the failure to perform common tasks, in general, the history of the construction of the Tower of Babel in miniature. <br><br>  5. <b>Specialties invented for more successful monetization of your makings.</b>  Invented a specialty along with the division of labor of the bourgeois.  In pursuit of profit: the manufactory gave a faster volume of cheaper supply for the market with demand than single-piece ‚Äúslow‚Äù production.  An obvious consequence of the activities of crops with limited reserves and unlimited requests.  Here, only in the pursuit of a great goal - enrichment - the main disadvantage of the fictitious economics of applied professions, <i>connected with paragraph 4</i> , was decided not to eliminate.  Because you can profit from this: lack of competence to meet your own needs is reduced to the formula ‚Äúexchange skills for money and buy the skills of others for them‚Äù.  So everyone began to live this way - it‚Äôs convenient: do what you like, buy the rest. <br><br>  6. <b>While the work only feeds - it is bad.</b>  After all, there is a vicious circle: I have the makings - I learn knowledge and acquire skills, relying on these moddings built from birth, to run faster and jump higher - I monetize my profession - I spend money on meeting needs.  The question arises: is it possible to immediately meet the needs and let this hellish work of acquiring a profession go by?  In the conditions of Western civilization - no.  Not enough money.  It is necessary to find the most monetized feature in the existing conditions, and thereby guarantee at the expense of it the maximum speed of obtaining money.  Otherwise you will be a loser, otherwise you will miss the chance.  Otherwise, <i>p. 5 will not start</i> .  But how often does it happen that the work itself, the process itself - above all the income from its monetization?  Yes, almost never.  Were born with megafiches - and we sell it.  And the needs are real sincere needs that cannot be met except on our own (others will never do that) - we buy.  Staying forever unsatisfied.  Needing forever in work.  Staying forever on the choke. <br><br>  But all you need is to listen to yourself, to find inside what you are doing, you just scream with pleasure for years.  And do-do-do.  Regardless of the market conditions.  The market is easier to find than to exchange life for dissatisfaction.  And then p. 6 will not create p. 5, and that one - p. 4, and so on, and - profit - your GTD will start to act :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/115543/">https://habr.com/ru/post/115543/</a></p>
