And I do not really like to take risks. <br>  But I love technology.  Therefore, I want to share some thoughts on virtual tours. <br><br>  To begin with, in fact, a virtual tour is a very convenient thing.  When I personally travel, I try to see to the maximum those places where I want to go, while still at home. <br>  And we are talking not only about museums (although, in principle, it‚Äôs also convenient), but about all sorts of hotels and other such things.  Well, you see, it is much more pleasant to come to the hotel and know in advance where to go, and not try to catch someone who will explain this to you. <br><br>  <b>I would like to note the two most obvious approaches to creating such excursions:</b> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><ul><li>  In my opinion a very obvious approach. <br>  Taking into account the release of the iPhone 4, we can talk about such excursions more confidently, when including such factors as <b>wi-fi and 3g</b> in the list. <br>  In principle, there is the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating a special service or ‚Äúprofession‚Äù for such excursions. <br>  Suppose you want to see the city that you decided to go to - call such a service, order a guide - using a video call you are at home, watch what interests you. <br>  You can continue further. <br>  So you came to this city and suddenly you were suddenly sick, and you wanted to see so much. <br>  What to do?  Call this service again and order another guide who will already give you a tour of the museum or any other place that you cannot visit in person. <br>  And so it is possible to infinity. </li><li>  The following approach should have a good technical base. <br>  In Russia, virtual tours in the form of applications are not so common.  They exist, but mainly in museums and central places (and we don‚Äôt just go to museums, let alone virtual ones), and even then not all.  Secondly, they are not at all user-friendly (Around the World, etc.).  And I would like to be friendly.  And, thirdly, it would be nice to transfer all this happiness to the phone.  After all, it is much more convenient to see everything without departing from the cash register. </li></ul>

      So, my idea is to create several concepts that will be virtual tours.  For a start - in Moscow.  And my choice is explained not only by the fact that it is the capital and that I live here, but also by the fact that it‚Äôs easiest to get lost in Moscow, in my opinion.  And also by the fact that I personally know several indigenous (!) Muscovites who have no idea about what exists in Moscow.  What can we say about those who just visit the capital? <br><br>  I love Moscow and I think that there is something to see.  And only the Kremlin and Lenin show visitors.  Uninteresting.  By the way, a virtual tour of the Moscow Kremlin Museums just exists.  And I want to be more for others.  Give us more museums, good and different!  And at the same time and parks, and bars, restaurants and other eateries. <br>  Ideally, you can create a symbiosis of virtual excursions and augmented reality. <br>  There are some results: <br><br>  <i>Current device location</i> <br><img src="http://img695.imageshack.us/img695/7531/81323182.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <i>Description of the nearest park zone</i> <br><img src="http://img180.imageshack.us/img180/6336/89121135.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Good luck! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/98310/">https://habr.com/ru/post/98310/</a></p>
