A service that will help you easily and simply share emotions with your near and dear ones. <br><br>  <strong><em>‚ÄúAll you need is to send us a digital photo, and we will make sure that high-quality and professional images are in the hands of your relatives and friends.‚Äù</em></strong> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/99/07/9907b2d8721b6596564c2538b2158a4e.jpg" alt="image" align="left">  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe birth of the service came to me after the next parcel to my hometown with photos and souvenirs for my relatives.  I have long forgotten those times when I lived with my parents, and I had the opportunity to visit my grandparents at least once a week, because I, like probably many of you, live and work very far from my hometown.

      Keeping in touch, sharing my emotions and impressions is helped by photography.  Maybe it sounds trite, but it‚Äôs good and high-quality pictures in which the plot has been viewed have been pleasing my grandmother for years, and allowing us to communicate with her at a distance.  It is always unexpected for her, pleasant and can not but rejoice. <br><br>  This is how e-motiondelivery was born - an online photo printing and delivery service that will allow you to send a photo from your mobile phone directly to the mailbox to the recipient. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Lyrical digression </h3><br><br>  In an era of rapid development of the Internet, sharing information with your friends and family has become much easier - just register in any of the social networks, and you have great opportunities - like, upload photos, want videos, want to mark friends on your photos and much, much another. <br><br>  But imagine the usual situation - you, a young student, live and study away from home.  This turning point comes for most of us.  A bunch of new emotions, hobbies and ... photos that you really want to show your distant friends, parents, grandparents.  How to be?  Send photo by email?  Put on your personal page in the social.  network?  Can.  But your grandmother hardly knows what facebook, classmates, VKontakte, email, and indeed, the Internet is. <br><br>  This is where the good old and proven way comes - photo printing.  You just need to print photos and send to the desired address. <br><br>  Where is my flash drive?  You ask yourself.  Find it, upload your photos to it, find the nearest print service, wait a few hours, and here they are - the cherished photos.  But that's not all.  Now you will need to walk to the post office to buy an envelope, fill it in and put it in the mailbox.  Conveniently?  That is why most of us began to abandon the traditional print. <br><br>  Electronic information is quickly updated, becomes outdated, loses relevance.  Can you find your electronic photos 2 or 3 years ago now?  Probably, yes, but with difficulty, in some sort of ‚Äúthick‚Äù multi-gigabyte folder with a bunch of unnecessary ‚Äútemporary‚Äù photos.  And now ask your parents to show you your children's photos and in 5 minutes you will be holding an old, battered little album with beautiful, specially selected photos.  Isn't that impressive?  So what to expect? <br><br><h3>  Why do we need another photo printing service?  There are already a million of them! </h3><br><br>  That's right.  Services that offer a lot of printing photos.  They are in any city, photo printing salons are found almost at every turn.  Why do we need another one?  You ask.  Let's look at the process of printing photos through the online printing site. <br><br>  Here is a list of actions that you need to perform in order to print your pictures and send to relatives (it may be slightly adjusted, depending on the services of a particular service): <br><ol><li>  Upload a photo from your computer to the site.  This usually happens in a browser window, having previously filled out a form with a bunch of personal data. </li><li>  Choose a printing method, choose a paper for printing, a paper size, determine the cost of printing. </li><li>  Confirm the order and make money (the methods can be any number from the simplest to the most sophisticated). </li><li>  Pick up the finished photos in the office.  Or use the services of a courier. </li><li>  Buy an envelope, pack photos, fill in the address and send. </li></ol><br>  Complicated?  Laziness?  Yes.  That is why most of our photos are stored electronically and that is why a service was born that allows you to take a fresh look at printing and delivering photos. <br><br>  Here are three simple steps that need to be done in order to get your photos directly from your mobile phone into the mailbox of any of your addressees or recipients: <br><ol><li>  Register on e-motiondelivery.com (no more than a minute). </li><li>  Pay for a subscription (by choosing one of the three tariff plans). </li><li>  Upload photos in any convenient way for you - via a web browser, online editor, by email, via VKontakte or Facebook album, send photos directly from a mobile phone. </li></ol><br>  Your photos will be printed on Kodak photo paper and mailed to your recipients once or twice a month (depending on the selected fare).  The size of the photo is standard - 10x15. <br><br>  Short video on working with the service - shows the internal interface and several ways to add recipients. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/_UUlx0IHnaI%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhgmYUPrK6H_tejsmfjpu_gy2asp0w" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  We wanted to simplify the process of transferring a digital photo to a photo as much as possible, therefore we added the ability for you to export photos from social networks to your personal account on the e-motiondelivery website. <br><br>  How it works?  You need to add our user as a friend, create a photo album with the name e-motiondelivery and transfer to it the photos you would like to print.  All images will be automatically transferred to your personal account and added to the print queue. <br><br><h3>  Photobooks in the new format </h3><br><br>  Another feature of the service is the ability to order a photo book with the original design of the photos of your album in the social.  networks.  Your photos will be printed along with user comments.  At the moment, there are two types of photobooks available - a VK photobook and a Facebook photobook. <br><br>  The format of photo books and their design allows you to place your photos so that they are not distorted, stretched or compressed. <br><br>  The finished photo book will be sent to you or your addressee by mail.  This, by the way, is a very good and original gift. <br><br><h3>  The technical side of the issue, prices and organization of the printing process </h3><br><br>  I will touch briefly on the technical side of the process of printing, sending and maintaining the service.  At the moment, our site is located on paid overseas hosting, which should be noted as a minus, because with a large influx of visitors there is a high probability that the site will fall.  The plans - move to your own server. <br><br>  Photos are printed on their own equipment in a specially equipped place for this - a mini laboratory.  This allows you to significantly reduce the cost of printing and control the quality.  All printed photos are packed in the same laboratory and sent by mail to the courier.  Delivery is carried out by Russian Post.  Photobooks are sent 1st class. <br><br>  Delivery of photos is carried out in many cities of Russia and other countries.  All you need is to specify the exact delivery address. <br><br>  Now, regarding the price - a monthly subscription will cost you 150 rubles.  For this money you get the opportunity to send printed photos once a month (sending is done on the 25th day of the current month) - 15 photos in the size of 10x15 to one addressee.  Each additional recipient will cost 150 rubles. <br><br>  If you want to send your photos twice a month, then the Monthly 2 tariff plan is suitable for you, the cost of which is 250 rubles per month. <br><br>  For those who rarely send photos and there is a one-time rate.  The cost of printing one photo is 10 rubles + 35 rubles for delivery to one addressee.  This is quite an expensive rate and therefore cheaper to choose a monthly subscription. <br><br>  Payment processing is carried out through the services of RBKMoney and ROBOKASSA. <br><br>  In the plans - applications for Android, iPhone for uploading photos, an online gift shop that you can add to your departure - perhaps these will be magnets with the symbols of cities. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/8e/ea/8eeae7cc5c9aadd24d96e8af8954c0a6.png" align="right">  <a title="photo printing service" href="http://e-motiondelivery.com/">Site of the project</a> - carefully, we are afraid of habra effect :) <br><br>  We welcome your suggestions for improving the service, as well as constructive criticism. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/119070/">https://habr.com/ru/post/119070/</a></p>
