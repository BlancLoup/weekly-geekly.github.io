Lying snow outside the window and the heating turned on thinking about the eternal, and my eyes fell on the chic industrial PDA running PalmOS. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/fec/b04/926/fecb0492634325cc0b85de0f92b3b6b9.jpg"><br>  <i>Data collection terminal</i>

      Once he was given to me, but I never used it.  At first, he did not have a lace for the COM port.  And then in the process of artificial soldering to the contacts - the cable from the cradle's motherboard to the port of the PDA was cut off.  So lay a dead weight. <br><br>  And I wanted to reanimate this palm, and so that was the motivation, I decided to start to look at what kind of emulators are under linux, in order to see what software is and whether it is worth it.  And with the search and installation of the emulator I got a little carried away ... Snow, the cold weather of May affected me so much that I decided to try writing for this PDA.  Moreover, the Palm is the CCP of my student youth, then it was an insanely cool gadget.  Then I did not know how to program for them, but I really wanted to.  After more than 14 years (feel old, yeah) - I decided to try to do it. <br><br>  If you are interested in how to emulate this PDA, and even better to write software for it, then let's go read further. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  What you need to start developing for Palm? </h2><br>  This question may seem simple to someone: they say, download the compiler and go.  Yes, it‚Äôs easy to start developing under palm trees.  The simplicity is the same as in the well-known picture: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/comment_images/602/1ad/daf/6021addaf20b31ec17c37eb0bab16ddc.jpg"></div><br>  The funny thing is that Windows users either need to buy the <b>Metrowerk's CodeWarrior for Palm</b> compiler, or turn their Windows into UNIX using cygwin and then just about everything as described below for linux.  I do not know how things are now with modern Windows, but the path is clearly real perverts and, judging by the many forums and articles, not everyone is in the teeth.  So what to do next is described for Linux Mint (read ubuntu 14.04).  The way is working. <br><br>  So, what do we need to develop, debug, test our software: <br><br><ul><li>  Palm emulator (POSE). </li><li>  ROM image for POSE. </li><li>  PRC tools (GCC compiling software for PalmOS). </li><li>  PalmOS SDK. </li><li>  PilRC (resource compiler). </li></ul><br>  Emulator <b>Palm POSE (Palm Operation System Emulator)</b> - a program that allows you to run all kinds of programs without copying them to Palm.  Which is very convenient.  Especially for those who do not have Palma, but want to play with different software.  But the emulator will not work without the <b>ROM image</b> - this is the actual firmware image of the live PDA.  You can remove it with the same POSE from a real PDA, or download it on the Internet.  <b>PRC tools</b> are, in fact, a set of tools for compiling programs (compiler, linker, debugger).  As it is not sad, but PRC tools will not work without <b>PalmOS SDK</b> for a specific version of PalmOS.  To understand this, it took a couple of days to read the manuals.  Well, the last thing is the <b>PilRC</b> compiler and resource <b>viewer</b> , a thing that allows you to prepare binary files responsible for drawing the menu and replacing pictures on the screen. <br><br><h2>  What is the difficulty? </h2><br>  All this could be taken on the official website <a href="https://palmos.com/">palmos.com</a> .  But alas, oh, the Palm company died in 2010 (absorbed by Hewlett-Packard) and their site died. <br><br>  Most of the links on the Internet - broken.  As a result, the search and installation of all software turned into an interesting quest for finding packages, documentation, instructions, testing, which resulted in this article. <br><br>  There are a lot of ways to get this software.  One of the Jedi Linux paths was to collect everything from source codes and even honestly tried ... <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2ea/8f2/40e/2ea8f240e71619b634bcf07afa6d79a0.jpg"></div><br>  But I realized that this is a completely gemmorous way. Here I will talk about the simplest and fastest way (maybe not optimal). <br><br>  All the packages, archives and software mentioned in the article were carefully assembled into a single archive.  So that you can even stumble upon this article 10 years later, in a fit of nostalgia, start programming for PalmOS. <br><br><h2>  PalmOS emulator </h2><br>  The most interesting, and probably demanded paragraph in this article.  Very few people will be able to assemble programs, but please try to drive old toys or different software. <br>  To install it, we need: <br><br><ul><li>  POSE emulator itself </li><li>  skins of various handhelds </li><li>  ROM-PDA file that we want to emulate. </li></ul><br>  The emulator was found by me <a href="https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/lucid/i386/pose/3.5-9.1ubuntu2">here</a> (file pose_3.5-9.1ubuntu2_i386.deb in the archive).  Download and install it with the command <br><br><pre><code class="hljs css"><span class="hljs-selector-tag"><span class="hljs-selector-tag">sudo</span></span> <span class="hljs-selector-tag"><span class="hljs-selector-tag">dpkg</span></span> <span class="hljs-selector-tag"><span class="hljs-selector-tag">-i</span></span> <span class="hljs-selector-tag"><span class="hljs-selector-tag">pose_3</span></span><span class="hljs-selector-class"><span class="hljs-selector-class">.5-9</span></span><span class="hljs-selector-class"><span class="hljs-selector-class">.1ubuntu2_i386</span></span><span class="hljs-selector-class"><span class="hljs-selector-class">.deb</span></span></code> </pre> <br>  Skins were found <a href="https://www.zophar.net/linux/palm/the-palm-os-emulator.html">here</a> along with the POSE sources.  This is the file <b>emulator-skins-19.tar.gz</b> in the archive.  Unpack this archive into your home folder and rename it to Skins or skins.  As a result, the appearance will correspond to a real piece of iron.  This is just a nice bonus, and without it everything will work. <br><br>  To make the emulator work, you need to give it a file from ROM.  Roma were found <a href="http://www.mypalm.ru/html/emul-rom.shtml">here</a> .  Personally, I use <b>palmos40-en-m505.rom</b> .  We run POSE from the console, in the folder where to get the ROMs, since this software does not like Russian letters.  Right-click on an empty window, select File-New in the window that opens, select ROM file and the file itself. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9eb/4be/34b/9eb4be34b4c65580a9857cf935c41cac.png"></div><br>  And click OK.  If everything is done correctly, then we get a working emulator, in which you can already run almost any Palm software (except for working with hardware). <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6fb/ecd/3bd/6fbecd3bd6311829f9dd55842bc10769.png"></div><br>  <i>Ready emulator</i> <br><br>  The most pleasant bonus is that the installation of the programs goes in two clicks and very quickly, unlike the installation on a live PDA.  This is important when writing and debugging software. <br><br><h2>  Tulchain and SDK </h2><br>  In order for everything to start functioning, you need to put a few more things.  Namely: PRC tools, SDK for palm and PilRC.  PRC tools is the port of our beloved GCC, but with an output format for PalmOS.  The SDK contains several libraries and a bunch of headers for the Palm API.  Finally, PilRC is needed to compile resources.  The following describes how to install PRC tools and the SDK. <br><br>  Source PRC tools can be found <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/prc-tools/">here</a> .  This is a bunch of patches for binutils, gdb, gcc and linker that gives support for PalmOS.  I personally put it <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Programming_for_Palm_OS/PrcTools">according to the instructions</a> .  The instructions below are just a copy of it.  You can not download packages, but simply install everything from the folder in the prc-tools archive: <br><br><pre> <code class="bash hljs"><span class="hljs-built_in"><span class="hljs-built_in">cd</span></span> /tmp <span class="hljs-comment"><span class="hljs-comment">#  wget http://ftp.gnome.org/mirror/cdimage/snapshot/Debian/pool/main/p/prc-tools/prc-tools-arm_2.2.90.cvs20030306-6_i386.deb wget http://ftp.gnome.org/mirror/cdimage/snapshot/Debian/pool/main/p/prc-tools/prc-tools-doc_2.2.90.cvs20030306-6_all.deb wget http://ftp.gnome.org/mirror/cdimage/snapshot/Debian/pool/main/p/prc-tools/prc-tools-m68k_2.2.90.cvs20030306-6_i386.deb wget http://ftp.gnome.org/mirror/cdimage/snapshot/Debian/pool/main/p/prc-tools/prc-tools-utils_2.2.90.cvs20030306-6_i386.deb wget http://ftp.gnome.org/mirror/cdimage/snapshot/Debian/pool/main/p/prc-tools/prc-tools_2.2.90.cvs20030306-6_all.deb wget http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/universe/p/pilrc/pilrc_3.2-3_i386.deb sudo apt-get install libstdc++5 sudo dpkg -i *.deb</span></span></code> </pre> <br>  Everything, now we had a working compiler.  But it doesn‚Äôt compile because it‚Äôs just a stub instead of the header files.  You need to install the SDK itself.  I planned to conduct development for PalmOS 3.5 and took <a href="http://cdn.xenu.tk/pub/palm-archive/pub/programming/sdk/3.0/">it here</a> , there it is also for later versions of PalmOS (4th and 5th). <br><br>  Similarly, you can not do the download of the wget file, but simply go to the sdk-3.0 folder and make everything from it. <br><br><pre> <code class="bash hljs"><span class="hljs-comment"><span class="hljs-comment"># sdk wget http://web.archive.org/web/20141224205502/http://cdn.xenu.tk/pub/palm-archive/pub/programming/sdk/3.0/sdk35.tar.gz #    sudo mkdir /usr/local/palmdev sudo mkdir /usr/local/palmdev/sdkpalmos-3.5 #  tar -xzf sdk35.tar.gz #     sudo cp -r Palm\ OS\ 3.5\ Support/* /usr/local/palmdev/sdkpalmos-3.5/ cd /usr/local/palmdev/sdkpalmos-3.5/ #     (       ) sudo mv Incs include sudo mv GCC\ Libraries lib #  ! #   ,      SKD      . sudo palmdev-prep /usr/local/palmdev/sdkpalmos-3.5/</span></span></code> </pre> <br>  The SDK has several useful archives: <br><br><ul><li>  sdk35-docs.tar.gz - archive with documentation.  In my opinion, just a godsend! </li><li>  sdk35-examples.tar.gz is a great archive with examples.  I strongly recommend that you download or take them from the archive. </li></ul><br>  At this stage, we can even put together a primitive helloword!  Create a file hello.c.  We write in it <br><br><pre> <code class="cpp hljs"><span class="hljs-meta"><span class="hljs-meta">#</span><span class="hljs-meta-keyword"><span class="hljs-meta"><span class="hljs-meta-keyword">include</span></span></span><span class="hljs-meta"> </span><span class="hljs-meta-string"><span class="hljs-meta"><span class="hljs-meta-string">&lt;PalmOS.h&gt; UInt32 PilotMain( UInt16 cmd, void *cmdPBP, UInt16 launchFlags) { EventType event; char *message = "Hello, world!"; if ( sysAppLaunchCmdNormalLaunch == cmd) { WinDrawChars( message, StrLen(message), 55, 74 ); do { EvtGetEvent( &amp;event, evtWaitForever); SysHandleEvent( &amp;event); } while (event.eType != appStopEvent); } return 0; }</span></span></span></span></code> </pre><br>  And compile a sequence of commands <br><br><pre> <code class="bash hljs">m68k-palmos-gcc HelloWorld.c -o hello m68k-palmos-obj-res hello build-prc Hello.prc <span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">"Hello"</span></span> HELO *.hello.grc</code> </pre> <br>  <b>Fill the</b> file <b>hello.prc</b> in our emulator, run and get <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9e1/0b1/e8c/9e10b1e8c4df0882f4eed376eb053f8a.png"></div><br><h2>  Resource Compiler PilRC </h2><br>  In general, it may seem that truncated can be programmed.  That's the way it is, and all programs will now be compiled, compiled and run, but will not work!  Since they still need to compile resources.  (logical, damn it).  To compile resources, we need the PilRC compiler itself, and to view them, PilRCUI.  This project is alive and well, the source code lives <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/pilrc/">here</a> .  I strongly recommend downloading the source code (there is in the archive), because there is full of excellent documentation.  And the packages themselves were found by me in the old <a href="http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/universe/p/pilrc/">ubunt repositories</a> .  For the package compiler, you need to download the file pilrc_3.2-3_i386.deb (available in the archive) and install it with the command <br><br><pre> <code class="bash hljs">sudo dpkg -i pilrc_3.2-3_i386.deb</code> </pre> <br>  I could not install the resource viewer in my current OS version.  More precisely managed, but it crashes with an error (which I could not fix).  I give an approximate version of the installation: to install it, you need to install additional libraries.  It was spent a couple of days to satisfy all dependencies.  In Google, I was just banned. <br><br>  It is necessary to download files from sites <a href="https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/glib1.2/1.2.10-19build1/%2Bbuild/462715">1</a> and <a href="https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/gtk%2B1.2/1.2.10-18.1build2/%2Bbuild/484191">2</a> : ibglib1.2ldbl_1.2.10-19build1_i386.deb, libgtk1.2_1.2.10-18.1build2_i386.deb and libgtk1.2-common_1.2.10-18.1build2_all.deb.  All this was folded into the daddy libs in the global archive.  After that we put them <br><br><pre> <code class="bash hljs">sudo dpkg -i libgtk1.2-common_1.2.10-18.1build2_all.deb libglib1.2ldbl_1.2.10-19build1_i386.deb libgtk1.2_1.2.10-18.1build2_i386.deb</code> </pre> <br>  But, alas, it all starts a miracle, but when you try to open a project, it crashes with a segmentation error.  All this successfully works so far only in ubuntu 8.04 is stably placed from the repositories and I use it for viewing, mounting the project folder on SSHFS. <br><br><h2>  A real graphic HelloWord! </h2><br>  It is time to show how to write a real graphics program for Palm!  I will not reinvent the bicycle and just show an example from <a href="http://mobile.eric-poncet.com/palm/tutorial/hello.html">Tutorial</a> . <br><br>  The program consists of several files: <br><br><ul><li>  hello.bmp - full size icon </li><li>  hellosmall.bmp - miniature icon </li><li>  hello.c - program source file </li><li>  hello.h - header file </li><li>  hello.rcp - resource file (text) </li><li>  Makefile - and the build script file itself </li></ul><br>  I will not dwell on the features of development and programming, if it is interesting, you can see these files in a text editor.  It is interesting to see the text file of resources, how it will look on the PDA.  To do this, and need the PilRCUI program.  Screenshot from Ubuntu 8.04 <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e08/27a/ad2/e0827aad2a6c274ad864ba9ff8e30cd7.png"></div><br>  We compile everything with the make command and upload the resulting hello.prc into our emulator. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/aff/91c/a02/aff91ca02cf42015b41a3fd51558ecc1.png"></div><br>  <i>Icon</i> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7c8/103/d71/7c8103d71385152a3d78d7089f14a587.png"></div><br>  <i>Launch</i> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/54b/c95/c0b/54bc95c0bb39a4292fe296b988c3fdbc.png"></div><br>  <b>View information</b> <br>  Okay, you say.  The emulator is good, but what about a live PDA?  I have them!  Walking through friends, I was able to dig out an old friend who served me faithfully in my student days.  Palm m100.

If you think that in our time no one writes for PalmOS, then how is this not true.  When I was looking to write a cool one, I thought about the game 2048, into which half the subway car is being chopped.  And as it turned out, there are several versions of them.  For example, <a href="">here</a> . <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b4d/c9a/26c/b4dc9a26cae4c7986ccedb82f22f653f.jpg"></div><br>  Written completely recently.  So, it's never too late to learn to program for palm trees. <br><br><h2>  About iron </h2><br>  If you are interested in such posts about the PDA, and you suddenly have old unnecessary PDAs, especially the Palm family, Psion (with a wire for the COM port), then I will gladly accept them as a gift for writing such posts. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/04a/53e/c2e/04a53ec2edfd0969ff3308bf5788e791.jpg"><br>  <i>Park PDA with linux, which had to be distributed ...</i> <br><br>  For example, you can talk about how to put Debian on Psion, make a local repository and go online to it.
