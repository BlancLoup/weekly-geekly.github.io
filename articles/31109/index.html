For example, travelers and many innovative solutions for shopping at airports, railway stations and hotels, which are designed specifically for <b>people in the media space</b> .  And although this side of trans-consumerism is still relevant, it is time to spread this trend also to those who are not going anywhere, because consumers are slowly but surely copying the behavior of travelers in their everyday life.  Moreover, from the point of view of our experience economy (Experience Economy), temporality and intermediateness become more and more valuable, or even revered, states. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  We have already discussed in the article about <a href="http://www.trendwatching.com/trends/UBER_PREMIUM.htm">UBER PREMIUM the</a> <b>relationship between experience and status</b> ;  ‚ÄúAs consumers of the luxury sector decrease their need for luxury goods, they are spending more and more ‚Äî and in many cases much more ‚Äî on the <b>experience of lifestyle changes</b> .  In the US, the cost of exploring luxury, including travel, dining, entertainment, recreational services, and other beauty and home services, nearly doubled, growing from $ 11,632 in 2004 to $ 22,746 in 2005: an increase of 95.5% (source: Pam Danzinger, Unity Marketing).

      As <b>experience becomes more valuable than a product</b> , many of the things that are attached to one particular person risk becoming synonymous with all sorts of straining, rapid obsolescence, and additional maintenance costs from their own wallet and personal time.  Which brings us to the new definition of trans -ism: <br><br>  <i>Trans-consumerists are consumers who, instead of everlasting owning some kind of goods, prefer to have fun, discover something new, fight laziness, get rid of the problems of owning a permanent home, those whose lifestyle more and more resembles life in the media space.</i>  <i>Life ownership is replaced by temporary possession in the ‚Äúhere and now‚Äù style, which means satisfying the need in a shorter period of time and striving to acquire as much experience as possible, as well as discover additional dimensions of personal history.</i>  <i><a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/31109/"><sup>*</sup></a> Ay, people, the past is already behind, and the future is foggy and unknown, so that we can only have the present, that is, to live "for today".</i> <br><br>  For most consumers, travel means temporary freedom.  Unforced, shared ownership or lack of ownership at all, the ability to touch new things, avoiding obligations and conditions, omitting formalities, acquiring endless new experiences.  Without a doubt, the travel industry today is one of the largest in the world.  It is also clear that some of the pleasures associated with travel have penetrated the daily lives of tens of millions of consumers, who have thus become "travelers."  In general, trans-dealers, mastering ‚Äúlife leasing‚Äù (leasing lifestyle), apply new approaches in the sense of renting different things, extending far beyond the capabilities of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avis_Rent_A_Car_System">Avis</a> or divided ownership of property (by the way, this market is now valued at $ 10 billion).  What are the trans-merchants after all?  This is a kind of mixture: <br><br><ul><li> The main thing is not to ‚Äúbathe‚Äù: the more things are in your permanent possession, the more you have to worry about things - repairs, going out of fashion, theft, etc. <br><br>  The most fashionable and new: the faster the development cycle of a new product is shortened, the more often consumers prefer to rent things in order to always keep up with fashion and innovations. <br><br>  Multiple experience: trans-dealers with limited financial capabilities can, instead of acquiring a single expensive item, rent, borrow, thereby expanding their experience, and then easily get rid of it. <br><br>  Climbing the status steps ( <a href="http://www.trendwatching.com/trends/MASSCLUSIVITY.htm">MASSCLUSIVITY</a> and <a href="http://www.trendwatching.com/trends/UBER_PREMIUM.htm">UBER PREMIUM</a> ): consumers who seek to achieve a higher status turn to shared ownership, since this is the only way for them to be able to flaunt status symbols (both established and new). * * * <br><br>  What happens when trans-merchants are <i>literally</i> in an intermediate state?  The popularity of <a href="http://www.trendwatching.com/trends/2002/11/BEINGSPACES.html">BEING SPACES</a> and <a href="http://www.trendwatching.com/trends/brand-spaces.htm">BRAND SPACES</a> (‚Äú <i>commercial residential areas in public places, intended not so much for entertainment or some services, but for giving people the opportunity to have a personal life also outside their home or office, for example, to watch TV, read a book, meet with friends and colleagues, etc.</i> ‚Äù) allows you to easily turn away from domestic and industrial troubles.  This phenomenon, of course, has been developing for a long time: sometime in 1990, sociologist Ray Oldenburg used the term ‚ÄúThe Third Place‚Äù, calling them places where someone could hide from the inevitable omnipresence of obligations to family and work collective , and in this way, for the time being, renounce our own sorrows and anxieties <br><br>  Another important aspect of trans-dumerism: a departure from rigidly fixed to a more ephemeral type of property <i>can</i> have a positive impact on the environment.  <b>More services and less goods</b> , more re-use through the purchase and sale of used goods, more divided property ... (Needless to say, if ‚Äútemporaryness‚Äù will be viewed simply as a synonym for ‚Äúdisposability‚Äù, the environmental consequences are unlikely to be rainbow colored). <br><br>  As an environmentally friendly side of trans-consumerism, you can give an example of clubs that help their members get rid of cars.  According to studies, each car that is in shared ownership replaces 7-8 private cars, because people tend to sell their cars or limit themselves to one car instead of buying a second one (source: Sydney Morning Herald).  Currently, there are more than 2,000 carshare <a href="http://ecoplan.org/carshare/general/cities.htm">initiatives and organizations</a> in 600 cities around the world.  From <a href="http://www.zipcar.com/">Zipcar</a> and <a href="http://www.streetcar.co.uk/">Streetcar</a> to <a href="http://www.greenwheels.de/">Greenwheels</a> and <a href="http://www.carcityclub.it/">Car City Club</a> .  Special mention deserves the Chicago <a href="http://flexcarnetwork.com/chicago-i-go/">I-GO Car Sharing</a> , because its fleet consists entirely of hybrid cars. <br><br>  Eco-leasing lifestyle is not limited to car sharing: take a look at several of the following eco-translation services. <br><br>  Free UK service <a href="http://www.cahooting.com/">Cahooting</a> , designed for those who want to take or offer something to rent.  The company's idea is to help make life on the planet more sustainable by reducing overproduction and overconsumption.  Users simply search for things by category and location, considering the price and terms of the lease.  Sports equipment, clothing, household goods, cars: you can rent anything there.  There are no restrictions associated with those who want to donate their belongings, whether it is a real rental company or an individual. <br><br>  Trends are always intertwined with each other.  Not every consumer will turn out to be a trans-manist, but not every trans-manist will spend all his time in the media space.  <b>There is always a need for roots, for a stable relationship, for shelter</b> .  People, consumers, as before, need some kind of base, they, as before, have to be sure that at least the most necessary remains available at all times.  Possession <i>really</i> involves a certain level of security, something that no one has the right to take from you.  Look at the millions of consumers who arrange for themselves <a href="http://www.trendwatching.com/trends/INSPERIENCE.htm">INSPERIENCES</a> (turning their home into a kind of office and entertainment zone) or <a href="http://www.trendwatching.com/trends/LIFE_CACHING.htm">LIFE CACHING</a> (diligent gathering, presentation and design of their life; nothing from the past should be forgotten), and so.  You should never forget this when you are dealing with trans-dumerism. <br><br>  More examples?  Well, we haven't even touched the most ephemeral of all worlds yet: the online arenas.  Where new content can be born in gigabytes, where new personalities can be tried on, like gloves, where random meetings can be arranged within minutes (for example, the <a href="http://www.adultfriendfinder.com/">Adult Friend Finder</a> includes more than 20 million participants interested in occasional connections).  <b>If you want to really break with the attachments of the real world - refer to the virtual</b> .  For more information on the latest trends in online trans-consumerism, see our material <a href="http://www.trendwatching.com/trends/youniversalbranding.htm">YOUNIVERSAL BRANDING</a> or ask for the services of one of the first virtual travel <a href="http://www.synthravels.com/">agencies Synthravels</a> . <br><br>  (And, of course, the trans-dealers will be the first to accept - or even demand - virtual goods. In addition, the more time they spend online, the less they need for expensive, ‚Äúfixed‚Äù and less mobile physical goods) . <br><br>  And what about the hundreds and thousands of professional field workers who, by default, have to be in intermediate conditions?  Pay attention to the new magazine <a href="http://www.monoclemagazine.com/">Monocle</a> , which opened in early 2007. The purpose of the magazine: ‚Äúto gather an audience of successful professionals who travel a lot and spend their time in several cities at once‚Äù.  A good place to introduce your new trans-type services to the right audience.  Or, for business publishers, this may mean: Monocle leaves enough space on the market for other magazines and websites dedicated to trans-tourists. <br><br>  <b>Note:</b> <br>  <strong>*</strong> <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/31109/">(back to text)</a> Read more about the concept of consumer ownership in the style of "here and now", we recommend <i>Gilles Lipovetsky's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Hypermodern-Times-Sebastien-Charles/dp/0745634214">Hypermodern Times</a></i> <br><br>  <b>Translation from English to:</b> <br>  <a href="http://blog.worldwebstudio.com/">blog.worldwebstudio.com</a> </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/31109/">https://habr.com/ru/post/31109/</a></p>
