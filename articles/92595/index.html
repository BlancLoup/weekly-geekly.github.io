  <section class="page js-page"><h1>LinCut is an easy and convenient way to save your favorite websites.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><h4>  Idea </h4><br>  Good time of day,% username%.  We are pleased to present the LinCut Project for everyone to see - an easy and convenient way to save selected websites.  <a href="http://www.lincut.com/">www.lincut.com</a> <br>  A bit of prehistory.  So many times it happened with a PC, now with the laptop inevitable - the OS flew, something broke, or being behind another computer (from a friend at work) needed access to links, etc.  And each time all the saved sites were lost, after which the hair was pulled out of the head and ran around the room shouting "Guard".  I think some readers are familiar with this situation. <br>  After another inadequate behavior of the OS, it was decided to find a service for the direct storage of all its bookmarks and favorites.  The services were found, but they all had one drawback - not the ability to store their links without a public review, and if the option was offered, it did not work as it seemed.  Leaving all reliable solutions was to make your service to solve such a banal problem with an even simpler solution.  This is how LinCut appeared. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><img src="http://img2.pict.com/2b/67/fc/3448733/0/640/lincutscr1.png" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Implementation </h4><br>  The service was made on CodeIgniter + MVC, a simple and intuitive interface, nothing superfluous.  The basic concept was around how to register users.  There were many options and an inadequate decision was taken - to do without registration at all. <br>  When you hover over a button on the main page, the user automatically gets his ID in the background, so the button becomes ‚Äúmarked‚Äù and the user can proceed directly to using the service.  To do this, drag the button to the ‚ÄúBookmarks Area‚Äù panel in the user's browser.  Over the design did not think long and did something in the style of Web 2.0. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
    <h4>  How to use </h4><br>  Everything is simple.  As soon as the button was overtightened, the service is available to the user entirely without restrictions.  On any site you like, press the -LinCut- button and a window opens in which you can write your comment, edit the title and / or simply click the Save button and the link will be entered into your ‚Äúsuitcase‚Äù.  In the same window you can find the link View My Bookmarks, by clicking on which we will see all the saved links. <br><br><img src="http://img2.pict.com/af/e0/5e/3448742/0/lincutscr2.png" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Functionality </h4><br>  Here they tried to achieve maximum simplicity.  You can sort the links, set the number of links on the page, save all links to a .txt file, an additional button for direct access to your link catalog, mark links with an asterisk (favorites). <br>  Also, for additional user security, the Private account function has been added (by default, Public account).  It, the function, makes the account protected by a PIN code set by the user (digital password). <br>  LinCut works in most popular browsers. <br><br><img src="http://img2.pict.com/c7/4d/60/3448765/0/640/lincutscr3.png" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Total </h4><br>  At the time of publication of the article, more than 1000 buttons have already been created and more than 100 people use the service; over 500 references (bookmarks) are in the database.  We are glad that we have benefited people who lacked a simple and clear service for saving links. <br>  There are many competitors, but this is not scary, because  unlike other services, our plans do not include monetization of LinCut according to strict, with kilometers of advertising.  Or complicate the service, turning LinCut into an incomprehensible invention like Delicious. <br>  LinCut is an easy way to save your favorite websites.  <a href="http://www.lincut.com/">www.lincut.com</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/92595/">https://habr.com/ru/post/92595/</a></p>
