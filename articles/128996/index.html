People publish on it everything that is interesting or important for them, starting with such trifles as impressions from the article read, ending with photos of the most significant events in life, including a wedding or the birth of a child. <br>  <b>Profile page development</b> <br><br>  At the dawn of Facebook, only the most basic information was published on the page - your name, picture, date of entry to the school ... in a word everything that you usually tell about yourself in the first five minutes of meeting a new person. <br><br><img src="http://a4.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/s720x720/301073_10150400613871729_20531316728_9934146_2101204425_n.jpg" alt="image">

      Over time, the profile page has evolved to better fit what you expect from chatting with friends.  Now on this page you can post photos from last weekend and tell you what your mood is today. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Since the focus is on recent events, important information gradually disappears from the page.  In place of photos from the prom come messages that you ate for breakfast. <br><br>  Imagine you met an old friend who you have not seen for a long time.  What would you like to know how he cooked scrambled eggs this morning, or how did he manage to get a job of his dream? <br><br>  In the current situation, 99% of the stories that you post on your profile page disappear from view.  The only way to find them is to click on ‚ÄúPrevious Publications‚Äù again and again. <br><br><img src="http://a6.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/297731_10150400614041729_20531316728_9934147_219869532_n.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Just imagine how great it would be if you could instantly find the publications that you posted a long time ago and collect in one place all the most precious memories. <br><br>  <b>Introducing the Annals of Events - a new type of profile page</b> <br><br>  In the Annals of Events (Timeline - at the moment this name does not have an official Russian translation on Facebook, probably, when it appears, it will be different) all your most interesting publications you have ever posted are stored.  Now they will not disappear anywhere as news is added. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/hzPEPfJHfKU%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhgtofmY8S6oek6XwOYrCII5-DkTgw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  The chronicle of events is much wider than the old version of the profile and more vivid.  The first thing that catches your eye is a huge photo at the top of the page.  This is your cover, and you choose which of the photos to place here. <br><br>  Under the photo you will see all your publications and photos displayed in chronological order.  You can highlight individual events in Letopisi, doubling their size, and also remove from sight what you would like to hide. <br><br>  <b>Filling in the blanks</b> <br><br>  If some important points of your life did not appear in the Annals of Events, you can open the date when they occurred and add their description. <br><br><img src="http://a8.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc7/s720x720/301073_10150400614246729_20531316728_9934150_63847833_n.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  You can also use your personal list of actions.  It displays everything you have ever published since the creation of your account on Facebook.  Click on any of the publications to add it to the Annals of Events that your friends can see. <br><br><img src="http://a4.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/s720x720/318580_10150400614436729_20531316728_9934152_1533069473_n.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Add to the Annals of events application</b> <br><br>  We bring to your attention a new type of social applications, with the help of which you can publish in the Annals of events what you found interesting - music, recipes of dishes and much more. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/q3b94kFBah8%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhgnfhr1n-zpCegPlS5Ox4rFLSe0pA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  With these applications, you can also find out what worries your friends.  You can even join them, for example, listen to the same song or watch the same TV show. <br><br>  You can already start using these applications, however the Annals of Events itself will start working only after some time. <br><br>  When the Chronicle of Events becomes available to you, you can make it public right away, or postpone it for a couple of days to check and add the missing parts. <br><br>  At last, you and your friends will be able to put together the most different moments of life - from everyday trifles to the most important events.  And what will your personal annals look like?  We look forward to her look. <br><br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/128996/">https://habr.com/ru/post/128996/</a></p>
