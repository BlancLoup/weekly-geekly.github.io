To avoid penalties, the courier must print a check at the time of delivery of the order.  But if it is necessary to automate the payment acceptance operation, which requires an installed mobile application on the courier device, it is logical to add software and other tools to it for the convenience of couriers and managers of online stores. <br><br>  Until recently, we offered two software products for mobile commerce: <a href="http://data-mobile.ru/datamobile-delivery/"><b>DM.Delivery</b></a> and <a href="http://data-mobile.ru/datamobile-seller/"><b>DM.Trade</b></a> .  Entrepreneurs could use one thing or buy both products.  Practice has shown that 90% of customers need the functionality of software, which is implemented both there and there. <br><blockquote>  We love our users, and so we decided to save them from having to install two applications and ‚Äújumps‚Äù when working from one to the other.  Not only did we combine the functionality into one module, we also made a discount for such a combination (that is, two software products with a ‚Äúpackage‚Äù will cost less than buying them separately). </blockquote><a name="habracut"></a><h3>  So, what's new in the DataMobile line for mobile commerce and delivery: </h3><br>  <b>1) Combining the modules <b>"Delivery"</b> and <b>"Trade"</b> into one.</b> <br>  For ease of use, the functionality was combined into one module.  In it, depending on the rights of the user, the menu items of each module are displayed.

When scanning a barcode, it will be processed in the software, it will be found on the product and automatically added to the order. <br><br>  <b>3) Added the possibility of rejecting the delivery document with the reason.</b> <br>  If for any reason the courier cannot deliver the order (the buyer refused, the courier does not have time to get to the place, the order is postponed the next day, etc.), then you can refuse it and indicate the reason for cancellation and attach a photo if desired.  However, if after refusal it turned out that the buyer will be able to accept the order (for example), then it can be returned to work. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img title="Cancellation of an order in DM.

There you can upload any information, such as name, phone, mail, etc. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img title="Field Manager for information to the courier about who placed the order" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/2k/wm/s6/2kwms6k2d2uy1bpwmn3s-98bugk.png" alt="      ,   "></div><br><br>  <b>7) Added soft-key scan.</b> <br>  This is a functional soft key that allows you to start the camera on the phone to read the CC or activate the built-in scanner on the TSD.  The button is located on top of the application and can be freely moved to any place. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img title="For convenience, customizable soft key to read barcode" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ax/kn/py/axknpyrmij-sfil42wvhzsfhqua.png" alt=" ,  -   -"></div><br><br>  <b>8) Added documents "Returns" in the "Trade".</b> <br>  The ability to issue returns on the basis of a specific trade order. <br><br><img title="Registration of return on the basis of the order in DM.

"><br><br>  <b>9) Implemented saving document filter.</b> <br>  If the courier constantly uses the filter to display the list of orders, then it will be convenient for him to select it once and forget about it, since the setting allows you to automatically apply it.  This is convenient if the courier has certain criteria for selecting orders that are regulated in the company (address, order number, barcode, customer, comment). <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img title="All settings in the program for reading one QR code" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ca/yn/7a/cayn7anv4swus57nfif0nm8upvk.png" alt="       QR-"></div><br>  It is worth mentioning that in the software there is a function for setting up an application through a QR code, i.e.  It is possible to sew all the necessary settings into a QR code that the user can scan and start working without a single setting.  Mobile software licenses do not have a hard binding to an ID device; the license server works on the number of connections. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img title="Licenses are not tied to the device, but to the number of connections" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ln/nm/cq/lnnmcqcehaglmxhcy058fqgfkem.png" alt="    ,    "></div><br>  As a result, in the new release of the Android application <a href="https://scanport.ru/equipment/programmnoe-obespechenie/po-skanport/DMMobileSales/"><b>DM. Mobile commerce</b></a> has become even more convenient and user friendly.  Plus, implemented a new useful functionality.  But we do not want to dwell on this!  It would be great if habrovchane share with us their thoughts, what do you think can be improved or improved in our mobile business application ‚ÄúDM.Mobile trade‚Äù?  You can download the demo version on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.scanport.datamobile.trade"><b>Google Play</b></a> . <br>  We appreciate your comments. <br><cut></cut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/348736/">https://habr.com/ru/post/348736/</a></p>
