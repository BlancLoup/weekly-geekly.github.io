That is how Japanese "Welcome!" Sounds.  Welcome to the new world of the old Japanese puzzle.  <a href="http://www.profsudoku.appspot.com/">Actually, sudoku ...</a> <br>  Sudoku is a game familiar to almost everyone.  To some extent, even already hackneyed, podnadoevshaya.  I want to refresh it a little, add new emotions to the process of solving it.  But can this be done?  Is it possible to pour a fresh stream into the familiarly measured flow of the Japanese puzzle without changing the rules? <br>  Well, let me try ... <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Have you ever bought a magazine with Japanese sudoku?  Not?  Well, then surely at least once solved Sudoku in a local newspaper.  Or in an entertainment magazine.  Or maybe even in a serious national newspaper, in which it was printed instead of the traditional crossword. <br>  Armed with a pencil and sometimes another eraser, you are in a tense silence going through possible combinations of numbers, carefully filling one cell of a half-empty square field after another.  Some numbers seem to be asking for their place, some are very difficult to pick up, and you will think for a long time what to do next.  The case moves, each new figure brings you closer to a clue.  And here‚Ä¶ <br>  "Why, right there, the four, don't you see? !!!".  This is your friend (neighbor, relative, passer-by - you need to underline) over his shoulder looked into your Japanese sacrament and decided to "help".  He feels smarter than you - because as one could not see these four, one should not be able to count at all, in order not to notice it!  He is pleased with himself.  Prompter‚Ä¶ <br>  Now imagine that there are ten such promisers at once.  You decide sudoku, and they tell you from all sides what figure and where to put it.  Even to complete the picture, imagine that you solve a sudoku not with a pencil and an eraser, but with a computer mouse, choosing the necessary numbers on the monitor screen.  And you do not need to put the suggested numbers, they pop up on the screen, like devils from a snuffbox. <br>  Presented? .. Well, then, " <i>Okari</i> " on the site of the game 9x9. 
      <br>

      Yes, with such a scenario, speed decides everything.  It is necessary to think quickly, it is necessary to count precisely and accurately.  Otherwise, ‚Äúprompts‚Äù will be ahead.  The intellectual puzzle turns into an arcade.  Dimensional crossing out of unsuitable numbers is replaced by a feverish search for continuation, searching for the next number.  Whoever finds them more, he won. <br>  According to the rules of the game, up to 10 people solve the same puzzle at the same time.  Having gathered at one "table", they gain points, getting them for correctly named numbers.  At the end of the game, the winners get rating points, and the losers go to experience their happiness again, at a different table.  Once there is a rating - there are its leaders.  The site publishes game news, various contests are held, players are assigned new levels for scoring rating points, and the rating itself is constantly updated.  In general, everything is almost like a real big RPG online game.  Is that the scope is smaller ... <br>  The site itself is made on Google App Engine.  Authorization is also natural through Google accounts.  The only thing that the site asks you about is to say how to magnify you in the game.  You can have any nickname on your google account, but in the 9x9 game you will have your nickname. <br>  On the site errors are possible, where without them.  Opportunities to test the site in extreme conditions, with a large influx of visitors, I did not have.  Strictly speaking, two or three people participated in the testing of the site, not more.  For more financial opportunities do not allow :).  That is why I would like to ask Habr's users to point out the errors found, communicate their wishes.  For my part, I undertake to be a diligent student, I will try to eliminate errors and fulfill your wishes on the site as soon as possible. <br>  I am far from the thought that this is the final version of the game.  I would like to add a lot, anti-cheat protection, departure tournaments and much more are in the first rows.  But for now, just want the users to appreciate the idea.  Does she have the right to life?  Do I need to continue to do all this? <br>  Personally, I hope so.  Waiting for your feedback and suggestions. <br>  <a href="http://www.profsudoku.appspot.com/">Game site 9 on 9.</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/101179/">https://habr.com/ru/post/101179/</a></p>
