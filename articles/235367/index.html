  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Incoming and outgoing calls in the call center</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The call center can be outsourced as a node that processes incoming calls from customers, and calls customers to promote any product or service (outgoing calls).  Call centers that process incoming calls that customers make, requesting any information, reporting a malfunction, or asking for help are usually meant for customer service or support.  Similarly, there are call centers that make outgoing calls, where operators call customers to offer products and / or services, and report on updating the product range.  All this has a goal to sell a certain product or service. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Outsourcing call centers allows customers to develop and nurture their business to the fear of competitors. <br><br>  There are different types of call centers for handling both incoming and outgoing calls.  All of them perform a specific set of basic functions and operations.  Some of the basic services provided when making outgoing calls are listed below.

    <h5>  Outgoing call center services </h5><br><br><h6>  Telemarketing: </h6><br><br>  Telemarketing refers to areas of activity related to the supply of goods and services over the phone.  This is the process of selling or promoting goods and services to future customers by phone.  Telemarketing involves using professionally skilled artisans to convince operators to increase sales, promote new products and services, and inform customers about product upgrades.  In some cases, pre-recorded product information is used, which is transmitted to the client after automatically connecting to it.  This is an automatic telemarketing.  Thus, telemarketing can increase profits when using well-trained personnel and modern telecommunications technologies. <br><br><h6>  Identifying potential users: </h6><br><br>  Attracting potential customers is not a new form of making a profit when promoting a new business, but at present there are new ways to solve this problem.  Information on customer preferences is collected (a customer profile is created) in order to determine the target audience for the product or service offer.  Internet, telemarketing, e-mails, etc. are used for this.  This task is solved in all sectors, but especially in the insurance business, in the field of education, in the offer of office goods, furniture, etc.  There is a tendency to increase the popularity of ways to attract customers, especially in areas focused on services.  To attract potential customers, a list of customers is created, from which a sample is made on the basis of data on the interests of the buyer. <br><br><h6>  Profiles: </h6><br><br>  Customer questionnaires by telephone are one of the most widely used components of the spectrum of opportunities provided by a call center.  Questioning allows you to estimate the percentage of customers who are satisfied with the quality of goods or services.  Questioning allows the company to improve the quality of the goods or services provided by examining consumer feedback and ultimately leads to increased profits.  Also, the survey allows you to identify customer preferences for advertising and marketing purposes. <br><br><h6>  Debt collection: </h6><br><br>  Debt collection is one of the functions that can be implemented at a rented call center.  It is used when collecting insurance payments or loans from both individuals and organizations.  Debt collection is usually required for mortgage lending, insurance or financial markets.  Thus, call center outsourcing saves time and money for the company that will use it.  Operators convince customers to pay their debts on time to avoid litigation. <br><br><h5>  Incoming Call Center Services </h5><br><br><h6>  Customer service: </h6><br><br>  Customer service, as the name implies, has a goal to satisfy customer needs.  It provides customer service before and after the purchase of a product or service to ensure quality of service.  Quality customer service is of paramount importance in all industries.  Relationships with the client are built through dialogue and contribute to the retention of the buyer, his return to make new purchases.  Thus, the operators who process incoming calls are able to listen to customer complaints about poor-quality service or incorrect product and take immediate action to solve the buyer‚Äôs problems.  Good customer service attracts good buyers and ultimately contributes to increased profits. <br><br><h6>  Technical support service: </h6><br><br>  The technical support service assists clients in computer and IT-related issues.  The technical support service has a certain area of ‚Äã‚Äãresponsibility and performs a specific set of functions.  Service operators provide customers with vital information on computer and related issues.  The technical support service in the call center not only answers technical questions, but also assesses the problems.  Technical support is an important part of every company and is the most important means of customer support and service.  Each company seeks to keep its customers satisfied.  High-quality technical support allows you to solve problems as they arise and is the primary means of supporting customer loyalty to the company. <br><br><h6>  Troubleshooting: </h6><br><br>  Troubleshooting - repair or repair advice, sent by phone to the buyer who bought your product.  The scope of technical support extends to telesales, pre-sales training, technical support via the Internet, remote support.  The purpose of the support service is to provide customers with product information and technical assistance 24 hours a day.  Thus, customer support adds points to your business. <br><br><h6>  Order table: </h6><br><br>  The order table allows customers to place orders over the phone through the order desk operator.  The operators of the order desk place orders and dispel customer doubts about the products being purchased.  The order desk has become the main part of the call center handling incoming calls, it provides visible benefits, and, importantly, it boosts sales.  For remote buyers, the order desk also provides shipping information.  All this, besides sales growth, still contributes to profit growth. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/235367/">https://habr.com/ru/post/235367/</a></p>
