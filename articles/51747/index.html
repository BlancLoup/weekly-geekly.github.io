From a paralyzing, depriving of strength and will of horror, as in a nightmare, when you lie motionless and think about one thing: if only I would not be noticed.  This is what sinners must experience in the presence of the Holy One.  Especially during the Last Judgment.  Who of them dared, who of them could speak, and so boldly? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Jes√∫s could.  He was tormented by nightmares from childhood, and he was used to it.  All you need is to get angry.  Because of mary - pissed off. <br>  ‚Äú <i>Don't touch Maria,</i> ‚Äù now it came out a little louder, and in the squeezed sting of hissing, a nascent roar was heard. <br><br>  Now the Archangel found Jesus with his eyes.  Just another sinner awaiting his fate.  The situation was completely out of place, but the Archangel found something to say.  He was a very intelligent Archangel. <br><br>  ‚Äú <i>A libertine, a thief and a suicide,</i> ‚Äù the Archangel put as much severity as possible in his voice, which made the people shrink even more, although it would seem that somewhere else?  - <i>Expect your verdict in humility.</i>

      The archangel thought and uttered words that, in his opinion, were to put everything in its place: <br>  - <i>Maria is a harlot and a suicide.</i>  <i>The sentence of the Most High is holy.</i> <br>  And, pleased with himself, he was going to return to the reading of the sentence. <br><br>  - <i>Fornication Maria for a few days made my life less unbearable.</i>  <i>‚ÄúDon't touch her,</i> ‚Äù Jesus himself was surprised at how many words came out and how freely they jumped out of her mouth. <br><br>  The archangel shrugged, read the last line of the sentence and said ‚ÄúAmen.‚Äù <br><br>  Howl  Roar  Roar  The beasts don't roar like that.  Only people roar like that.  Jesus growls like that.  And Jesus, it turns out, can move.  And the white clothes and the glittering face of the Archangel seem to Jesus red. <br>  A piece of flesh, dead and risen.  The soul that went through hell and sentenced to hell. <br>  Jesus rushed forward, hit the body, hit the desire and hatred, clutched his hands and teeth.  And the white clothes of the Archangel really turned red. <br><br>  <b><a href="http://pay.diary.ru/~me-grey-mouse/p61193935.htm">Author's parable</a></b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/51747/">https://habr.com/ru/post/51747/</a></p>
