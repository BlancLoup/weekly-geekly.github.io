This process is happening all over the world, including Russia.  Why?  Large vendors go in the direction of OpenSource for simplicity and unification of solutions deployment in the clouds. <br>  What happens with Java and application servers to the cloud era?  Oracle introduces a charge for using Java on servers and workstations.  Java EE turns into Jakarta EE.  Often, developers use clean jvm-based solutions for deployment in containers in private and public clouds, saving resources by excluding the usual JEE libraries from application servers. <br><br>  What if the application server can be so light and so flexible that it allows you to take advantage of Enterprise Edition platforms in containers with minimal impact on the resources consumed?  And what if we can make the application server the basic platform for microservice architectures? <br><br>  I'll tell you how to build applications in terms of using containers based on an open-source application server OpenLiberty, as well as the perspective structure of the Java community (OpenJDK, AdoptOpenJDK, etc.), Jakarta EE and the new MicroProfile standard for creating microservice applications. <br><br><h4>  Sebastian Dashner (Sebastian Daschner) </h4><br>  <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/java/new-java-champion-sebastian-daschner">Java Champion</a> , author and instructor, Java development professional (including EE).

You do not own the data that you load into them, you do not control the distribution of this data.  At any time, your account, in the development of which you have invested for years, can be disconnected from the service without explaining the reason and hope for recovery. <br><br>  We can speculate how the Internet could be if development proceeded according to the principle ‚Äúthe data belongs to the user who created them, the service belongs to the user who uses it‚Äù. <br><br>  Since I am not a lawyer and not a politician, but a Java architect, I‚Äôll look at the problem from the technical side.  What could be an alternative to the classic ‚Äúbrowser - web site - database‚Äù scheme in the modern cloudy world.  About five years ago, all the alternatives did not seem technically feasible, but now with the development of cloud services and Docker, Kubernetes, Helm technologies, it seems that at least technically there is an alternative. <br><br><h4>  Denis Tsyplakov, Solutions Architect </h4><br>  I started writing programs in the late 1980s, and since the mid-1990s I have been programming professionally.  I wrote programs in more than 10 languages, but Java remains my favorite.  Since 2006 works in the company DataArt.  The main interests in IT are: creation of fault-tolerant services, pragmatic system architecture, creative solution of non-trivial tasks. <br><br><h3>  Program </h3><br>  18:30 - 19:00 Meeting participants, welcome coffee <br>  19:00 - 19:45 <b>OpenLiberty is an unknown jaguar among OpenSource application servers</b> , Sebastian Dashner. <br>  19:45 - 20:00 Questions and Answers <br>  20:00 - 20:10 Break <br>  20:10 - 20:50 <b>Facebook in a zombie apocalypse</b> , Denis Tsyplakov. <br>  20:50 - 21:00 Questions and Answers <br><br>  <a href="https://dataart-spb.timepad.ru/event/998391/">Registration for the Java MAP - St. Petersburg - June 20</a> . <br></div></div></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/455930/">https://habr.com/ru/post/455930/</a></p>
