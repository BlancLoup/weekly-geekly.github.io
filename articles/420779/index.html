  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Boring company Mask: the tunnel to the stadium and the opening of the tunnel</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  A few days ago, Ilon Musk, who is the founder of the Boring Company, tweeted that his first tunnel would be available to the public on December 10th and uploaded a video that went through the whole tunnel from beginning to end, calling it "frighteningly long."  Construction was started a year ago in the parking area, near the SpaceX headquarters, as was the <a href="https://habr.com/post/405671/">relevant news</a> . <br><br><div class="oembed"><twitter-widget class="twitter-tweet twitter-tweet-rendered" id="twitter-widget-0" style="position: static; visibility: visible; display: block; transform: rotate(0deg); max-width: 100%; width: 500px; min-width: 220px; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;" data-tweet-id="1058767039102312448"></twitter-widget><script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><br><br>  Previously, the next news passed unnoticed.  The tunneling company created by Ilon Mask proposed another project in the Los Angeles area: one tunnel, approximately 3.6 miles long, from one of the metro stations to the Dodger Stadium. 
      <br>

      Currently, this idea is just a proposal, and there is still to be approved by the city council of Los Angeles, as well as all the permits necessary for laying the tunnel under the Echo Park and the surroundings of Silver Lake.  (The process is not easy: there are at least five different agencies that will be involved in the bureaucratic process prior to the creation of this tunnel.) <br>  There are three possible exits for the western end of the tunnel: at Los Feliz, East Hollywood or Rampart Village.  In each of them there is a metro station that can be used, and the Boring Company offers to buy a piece of land within walking distance of the station to create a station to enter their tunnel.  The other entrance will be located at or near the parking lot of the Dodger Stadium. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qp/kh/a4/qpkha4erj6s1rsko2gb3ynddq1c.png" alt="image"><br>  <i>Map with estimated tunnel routes to the Dodger Stadium.</i> <i><br></i> <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garchett is a big supporter of the projects Ilona Mask.  He stated that the tunnel to the Dodger Stadium, which will be called ‚ÄúThe Dugout Loop‚Äù, is ‚Äúan excellent example of a public-private partnership.‚Äù <br><br>  Despite the fact that the tunnel will be laid in some of the oldest and most built-up neighborhoods in Los Angeles, Dugout Loop is a very modest project, unlike the proposed high-speed line in Chicago, which can carry passengers from O'Hare airport to the city center within 12 minutes.  Thus, the Dugout Loop is probably a test tunnel before starting such a large-scale project. <br><br>  Although the Boring Company claims that this tunnel could ease traffic to the Dodger stadium during games and concerts, the tunnel will only work one way, so the company will have to build most of the passenger cabins for 8-16 people before the game near the western terminal or you will have to temporarily suspend trips in order to return the booths back.  The Boring Company claims that it will be able to transport about 1,400 people per game (an increase of up to 2,800 people is possible), pre-selling tickets for trips at the appointed time.  For reference, the capacity of the stadium Dodger is 56,000 people. <br><br>  Thus, Dugout Loop will not change the situation on the road in the vicinity of the stadium during the pre-game time, but will only check the physical and operational capabilities of this completely new underground transport scheme.  ‚ÄúBetween games and other events, the Dugout Loop will transport approximately 250,000 people a year,‚Äù the Boring Company calculated.  And to cover the entire distance of approximately 5.5 miles, it will take about 4 minutes, which is much slower than the speed line in Chicago, where the speed will reach 185-215 km / h. <br><br>  According to the company, six ventilation shafts will be built along the tunnel.  According to the prediction of the Boring Company, the construction of this entire facility, including two lifts that lower passenger cabins on the electric curtain from the surface down into the tunnel, will be 14 months, this is a very cautious forecast and construction can be completed faster. <br><br>  The company says that the noise from tunneling will be mostly indistinguishable from the street, as the tunnel will be underground at a depth of 30 feet (9.1 m), and in some places even deeper if the tunnel can interfere with the urban underground infrastructure. <br><br>  The ticket, according to the company, will cost about $ 1. Trips will be booked in advance, like booking a movie theater.  Boring Company will fully pay for the construction, without funding from the city budget. <br><br>  Interestingly, it looks like Dugout Loop can replace the project announced at the beginning of this year by the Boring Company to lay a test tunnel parallel to the 405 highway. The length of the tunnel would be 2.7 miles, and Musk said that test trips were planned to get feedback from users. <br><br>  Instead, the following statement is now on The Boring Company website: ‚ÄúPreviously, The Boring Company offered a test tunnel under Sepulveda Boulevard as a confirmation of the concept of creating tunnels in Los Angeles.  However, this proposal did not include passenger transportation and assumed only one ground terminal (and not two, as in the case of the Dugout Loop).  The Boring Company made technical progress much faster than expected, and decided to make its first tunnel in Los Angeles operational, therefore they will be Dugout Loop!
