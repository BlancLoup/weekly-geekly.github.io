In the rack (by today's standards) is already old sucks, which does not pull.  Once it was new and beautiful, but time is merciless.  Connected to the cloud, we first pulled test environments there, then production.  And the counter was useful for a couple of smaller tasks around the office and tests.  We see well how old servers are dying in them: as they fail, they bring up new virtual machines in the cloud. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/44d/a43/c13/44da43c13a284b948cbb6ae0cb0333c0.jpg"><br>  <i>This thing can forward 1C hardware keys to different subnets.</i>

      Historically, retail came to <a href="https://cloud.croc.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dblog%26utm_campaign%3Did338678">us</a> , then Internet projects, then banks pulled up.  Now, quite ordinary companies are also actively moving, and they are ready to put business-critical tasks into the cloud.  Below are a few typical stories that may be useful to you, even if you are not planning any clouds yet.  Although there is no place to go anymore, this is a routine, not a new incomprehensible feature. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Social Network LOQUI BUSINESS </h4><br>  Lokvi (business.loqui.ru) is a growing corporate social network.  A kind of full implementation of the corporate portal.  They realized that corporations lacked a social network for employees to communicate, and thought that this white spot should be closed.  It is clear that the development environment was needed.  Managers in Moscow, developers in Germany (mostly Russians).  The project was originally Russian, the base language is Russian.  Distribution - SaaS, provide customers with ready-made service.  That is, we have one large multi-tenant installation.  Why us?  Because the Russian segment of the social network must be in the Russian Federation.  <a href="https://cloud.croc.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dblog%26utm_campaign%3Did338678">The cloud</a> came up with flexibility at the design stage and the possibility of building a disaster-resistant infrastructure so as not to upset the fall of the owners of social accounts.  Now they are considering the possibility of backup or full migration to the <a href="https://cloud.croc.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dblog%26utm_campaign%3Did338678">CROC virtual data center of</a> foreign servers, where the media files are located, in order to provide more reliable protection against failures and maximum accessibility. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/37b/b43/c59/37bb43c59e79417caa5b5e49f2f445e6.jpg"><br><br>  We have done the automation of test environments: a complete replica of the main infrastructure, modules with auto-tests are launched on it, then from there - in the product or in the basket.  No equipment is idle, just for the duration of the tests, additional power is purchased - as many as you like.  Previously, they would solve a new piece of hardware, it would be necessary to make another testing queue to load it evenly, a separate admin. <br><br><h4>  Smartex </h4><br>  Web developers, who have learned not only to make cool sites, but also to support them, have used the pluses of Amazon throughout their adult lives.  But, of course, no matter what a cool website you make, if it is in Frankfurt, it will not open quickly in Moscow.  And for guys it‚Äôs important, they have dynamic content loading with multiple sessions.  The ping issue has become very important to them.  Amazon CDN in Moscow does not work.  The guys got up to us - it is important for them to have an API, which in our case coincides 80 percent with Amazon.  We have very simply those who moved from Amazon.  If they need a Russian CDN, they will simply turn to a Russian CDN provider, it is very simple. <br><br><h4>  How do banks </h4><br>  Banks come into the clouds only on very peculiar reasons.  Of course, this is the most conservative guys.  Rise into the cloud, but not all services.  Especially they hover PCI DSS.  We are about to close the certification of a cloud platform for this standard, and it will become much easier for all processing companies.  And usually, security guards do not allow anything in banks, so it‚Äôs not a cloud, but a fenced-off area in a machine room.  The answer to almost any commercial offer on the cloud is ‚ÄúGive a cell‚Äù, that is, a kitchen garden in the hall, but not elastic consumption. <br><br><h4>  How does retail </h4><br>  Example: a company is engaged in the sale of cosmetics in the price segment just below the well-known star network.  Even 70 meters from the enemy‚Äôs store, they grow very well in profit, and knowing that it is falling off during the crisis with its neighbors.  We became famous in our city as one of the most innovative companies.  Business reformatted and lead everything in a new way, according to the mind.  If they need something, they are looking for the best.  With IT, there was difficulty in expanding - the possibilities were far behind the desires, there was a small mess with support, a lot of things were done manually.  The team on the ground is excellent, but not enough hands.  With the wildest business growth during the crisis, they decided to spread to Moscow.  They really wanted to get away from the capital costs of operating expenses (this is generally important for all retail), because the financial flow and credit are cheaper. <br><br>  Began to move.  The level of planning they have is divine, we have almost never met such a person.  But the reality, of course, let down a little: the provider who built a separate physical channel did not keep the deadline a little. <br><br><h4>  E-commerce </h4><br>  One large retailer wanted to trade through the network, they have a base for 100 thousand items.  Fearfully.  But they coped with the fear and started doing click-and-collect on the European model, when you first order from afar, and then you take the assembled on-site.  At the same time, they abandoned paper catalogs, which all got a decent amount.  The level of hell by how quickly everything was implemented - hardcore. <br><br>  We have been working together for 15 years already, we provide all the stores with infrastructure.  Field engineers still drive with hard drives, power supply cleaning kits, and so on.  But then, no, no, the parent company for software support is from England.  Accordingly, their main employees are from India.  With the appropriate approach.  In particular, they work only on weekdays.  As a result, once on Saturday, we rescued their DBMS, which had gotten up tight (they forgot to clean the logs, 350 GB was accumulated).  Then there was another black Sunday, more and more ... Then they didn‚Äôt have all the services started, because they started with their hands.  I remember I called their admin and we played the command line by phone.  Well, also the Indian nuance of the approach - ‚Äúonly a coward backups‚Äù.  Also, these bastards Indians speak "good" English.  But as soon as something is wrong on their part, the clownery begins at conference stakes with what they, like, have ceased to understand.  But the only time when we had a piece of metal burned down, they started teasing us: ‚ÄúWell, what the fucking weekend were we having?‚Äù In general, we were a bit annoyed.  I said: ‚ÄúGuys, we love you very much, but we will not go to the dacha anymore.  Let's screw up normal monitoring to no surprises. ‚Äù  They scratched their heads - we made an offer, and they accepted it. <br><br>  Plus, each industry has its own characteristics.  We focus on large projects and maximum customer satisfaction.  But we are also friends with the developers.  CROC Cloud is an individual tailor.  Our experience, competencies, resources allow us to land big tasks of serious companies in the cloud, helping businesses to focus on their root functions.  IT we otrulim. <br>  The suit will sit perfectly. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/338678/">https://habr.com/ru/post/338678/</a></p>
