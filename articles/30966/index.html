The trick is that people have no idea why they act this way and not otherwise.  They have absolutely no idea about it, but still try to do something that will look meaningful.  Why do you need a Hummer if you are going to just go to the store?  "Well, you see, in case the snowstorm suddenly starts."  Not.  I want to ask, why are you buying a four-wheel drive SUV?  "Well, you see, in case I need to move off the track to a cross-path."  Good, but you live in Manhattan;  Why do you need an SUV in Manhattan?  "Well, you see, sometimes I go to ride and then ..." In general, one does not have to be a rocket science genius to guess what all this is nonsense.  All this has nothing to do with the real reasons for human actions.  That is, traditional marketing research is largely limited. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I will not criticize marketing research too much.  I would say that some people do it better, as in any field.  Some are not so good.  But if we are talking about the analysis of human behavior, I believe that we should read between the lines.  And my practice with autistic children was precisely that I had to understand what they were trying to tell me without using words.  And this is part of what I constantly do.

      How do I decipher this behavior, which is not expressed in words?  My theory is very simple: the reptile always wins.  I don't care what your mind is going to tell me.  I do not care.  Show me a reptile.  What for?  Because the reptile always wins. <br><br>  One simple reptilian example is motherhood.  I did a lot of orders for people who made products for women with children, right?  American women have various programs that come into effect as soon as they become mothers.  As soon as a woman becomes a mother, a reptile comes to power.  Suddenly she became a mother.  The husband moved to second place, and the first took the child.  Suddenly she felt at the level of instinct that she had to be constantly on the alert, ready to defend her child at every moment so that he would survive.  And this is something like a sacred mission, respectively, it has a higher priority, which is directly related to reptilian.  I believe that for a woman with a child, the code is total paranoia.  Mother knows that she must remain vigilant, staying on the line 24 hours a day, seven days a week.  She must feel the danger before others.  No wonder that sometimes they behave completely irrationally, and if you try to ask them: ‚ÄúHow would you act in such and such a situation,‚Äù and the like, well, they, of course, will answer you something quite meaningful.  But if you get close, when something real happens, you can see how the reptile takes over the mind, which is what was required to prove!  And this is the most interesting. <br><br>  <b>How much is this theory perceived by company executives?</b> <br><br>  This is extremely important for anyone who is engaged in communication - it can be journalism, TV, media or marketing - if you are talking to people, then it is extremely important to understand what I call the red reptilian hot button.  If you can't get hold of the red reptilian button, you have to work with the cortex;  you come up with interesting discounts and all that. <br><br>  Example: you have not eaten for two weeks, and suddenly some kind of food appears before you.  Will you be interested in the price at this moment?  The reptile part of your brain screams: ‚ÄúEat!  Eat!  Eat! ‚Äù, So the price bothers you a little.  The reptile always wins.  You are not able to impose on people something that contradicts their reptilism. <br><br>  During my time working on this kind of communication, which I developed and used for the 50 Fortune 100 companies that are almost my regular customers, it has never been enough to just send a message for a cortex.  ‚ÄúBuy my product, because it is 10 percent cheaper‚Äù: this is a cortex.  Hmm, well, if another offers me 5 percent cheaper, I will go to another.  Unable to buy loyalty for interest.  This is the essence.  It's not about numbers. <br><br>  I will give you an example.  When I started working with Chrysler, they told me: ‚ÄúWe did all the necessary research.  We organized all sorts of polls, focus groups and everything, and we know that Americans no longer want cars.  They want trucks, big SUVs;  they want minibuses.  They don't want a car. ‚Äù  And I told them: ‚ÄúIt seems to me that you probably made a mistake here because you are listening to what these people tell you;  I would not".  In general, I advised Chrysler: ‚ÄúLet's first do as I suggest.‚Äù  Let's try to understand the code.  I believe that they do not buy cars, because you do not offer them a car that requires their reptilian.  But if you manage to find this code of reptilism for a car, and you make a car with it, then they will begin to buy it. ‚Äù <br><br>  Then we did it all.  We used the principle of the first association.  The result was the PT Cruiser.  When people see the PT Cruiser they say: ‚ÄúWow!  I want him.  Some hate him;  it doesn't matter to us.  People who say: ‚ÄúWow!  I want this car ", enough to achieve great success.  And then, during the tests, when we asked them: ‚ÄúHow much would you pay for such a car?‚Äù, The people said, ‚ÄúWell, we would pay $ 15,000 or $ 35,000‚Äù.  You understand that when you have a product about which people say $ 15,000 or $ 35,000, this means that the price is simply not important to them. <br><br>  What exactly makes the PT Cruiser so reptile?  Firstly, this car has a pronounced identity.  The people say that: ‚ÄúWe are tired of cars that do not have their own I. I have quality, excellent gas consumption, everything is excellent, but when I see it from afar, I have to wait for it to come closer to understand what kind of model and read the title. "  When you go to visit your mother, she does not need to read your name to determine who you are, you understand?  We need exactly this reptile connection.  And so the chip with identity, as expected, betrayed the car a powerful reptilian. <br>  <b>What kind of steps are you taking?</b> <br><br>  Since we have three brains - cortex (cortex), medium (limbic) and reptilian (reptilian) - I have developed a special session, and since people are eager to demonstrate how reasonable they are, we give them such a chance and therefore start with cortex.  We call it ‚Äúpurgatory‚Äù or a big wash.  We do not care what they say, we do not believe any of this.  Usually it is all kinds of stamps.  They tell us everything that we have already delivered to them through advertising, media, newspapers and other communications. <br>  And then we have a break.  Usually they are very pleased with themselves.  They say, "Oh, we did a great job," and the like.  And when they return, we transgress to the second level, to emotions.  I tell them: ‚ÄúImagine that I am a five-year-old child from another planet and you need to tell me some little story.  I am only 5, which means I can understand only the simplest things.  I am from another planet, and this means that I don‚Äôt know anything about your planet and therefore you can tell absolutely everything that comes to mind. ‚Äù  From this moment on, they cease to see any meaning in what is happening.  And I just need this.  They get paid for it, and so they do it, tell me different little stories.  Their stories should start with ‚ÄúOnce upon a time.‚Äù  Suddenly they are in a very special state of consciousness.  They no longer try to behave logically or rationally, they only try to appease a five-year-old child from another planet, and they tell little stories. <br><br>  By the end of the second hour, when we have a break again and my clients are standing with them in a smoking room, they hear something like this: ‚ÄúThis guy is crazy.  What is he doing in general? ‚Äù;  ‚ÄúI thought I understood what we would do, but now I don‚Äôt understand anything at all‚Äù;  ‚ÄúI want to say - and for this they still pay me?‚Äù;  ‚ÄúI wonder what he is going to do with all this nonsense?‚Äù This means that everything is going as it should.  I need to disable the cortex.  Cortex is control, control, control, trying to be reasonable, and so.  But if you do not know what exactly I want, you can not influence anything. <br><br>  Then, when they return to the third part, there are no chairs there.  ‚ÄúWow, what happened here?  Why are there no chairs? ‚ÄùThen I explain to them that I want them to try to return to the moment when they first came up with what we are trying to understand - be it coffee, car, insurance, whatever.  That is, we need your very first experience, which usually occurs in childhood, and I want you to try to recreate it.  For this, I need you to plunge into the state that happens when you wake up in the morning.  Why?  Because when we wake up in the morning, the cortex begins to work at the very least.  And while he is not active, you still have access to the things that happened to you in your unconscious, during sleep.  But as soon as the cortex arrives, there are no traces left.  If I recreate a situation close to that when you wake up in the morning, you may be surprised when you begin to remember things that you forgot 20-30 years ago.  This is what I tell these people.  I say: ‚ÄúYou know that all this is completely voluntary.  If you do not want to do this, then you can not do it.  In any case, you will be paid. ‚Äù  At the very beginning they give a receipt that they are aware of everything that will happen. <br><br>  The main thing in all this is that they know that all this is completely anonymous.  They do not need to say anything.  People share with us because, in the end, we just give them a pencil, paper, and they write.  They know that all this is anonymous and that they are not required to provide a name.  Imagine that you were invited to a focus group, where you have to talk with 12 strangers for two hours about how you use toilet paper.  I want to say that this is not a very comfortable situation.  When I was doing toilet paper for Procter &amp; Gamble, they said: "Yes, we already know very well that no emotions can be associated with toilet paper."  I told them: ‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôm not so sure about this, because it‚Äôs not possible to see microbes if you don‚Äôt use a microscope.  You don‚Äôt see them, because you don‚Äôt have the right tools. ‚Äù  And when we started working with this toilet paper, people, knowing that everything was completely anonymous, returned to their first impression of this subject and - bang!  - It turned out that there is just a mass of emotions.  There were a lot of them.  But it absolutely did not fit into any framework of traditional marketing research. <br><br>  Well, when we get to this very first impression, it is no longer necessary to interpret it.  At one time I analyzed all this together with my clients.  Sometimes they reacted like: ‚ÄúWow!  I knew it".  ‚ÄúWow!‚Äù Sounded at the moment when they revealed the code.  The first time they got a coffee code, they said, ‚ÄúWow!‚Äù.  Since they are Americans, they use the code all the time.  This code is already in their minds, therefore, of course, they know it.  And this is very different from marketing research.  We do not conduct <i>research</i> , do not <i>study</i> .  What I do is discovery.  That is why my company is called Archetype Discoveries.  We are just opening, because we get the code that is already at our disposal;  we just don't see it. <br><br>  Therefore, what I do has certain limits compared to other marketing research.  After all, as soon as we find the coffee code, we will no longer be able to search for it again - it has already been found. <br><br>  ( <a href="http://ravve.habrahabr.ru/blog/8924.html">read more ...</a> ) <br><br>  <b>Translation from English to:</b> <br>  <a href="http://blog.worldwebstudio.com/">blog.worldwebstudio.com</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/30966/">https://habr.com/ru/post/30966/</a></p>
