The report is based on data on 7900+ salaries contributed by our users over the past six months.  70% of salaries paid by developers, the rest - by administrators, testers, managers, analysts, designers, eycharami, marketers and support specialists. <br><br>  This time, we will not only look at current salaries for major IT specializations, programming languages ‚Äã‚Äãand companies, but also see the semi-annual dynamics of some of them. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><hr><br><h1>  A little about the salary service "My Circle" </h1><br>  The salary service <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/moikrug/blog/343578/">was launched</a> on the ‚ÄúMy Circle‚Äù at the end of November 2017 with the goal of regular monitoring of salaries in the IT industry.  Salaries are left by the specialists themselves, we collect them and provide them in an aggregated and anonymous form to everyone in open access.  All data presented in the current report, as well as any other data, anyone can get on their own using <a href="https://moikrug.ru/salaries">the salary calculator</a> .

These are the salaries received on hands, after deduction of all taxes.  Dots indicate specific salaries.  A group of points for each sample is visualized using a ‚Äúbox with a mustache‚Äù.  The central vertical line shows the median salary (half salaries are lower, and half higher than this point, this salary can be considered average), the box borders are 25 and 75 percents (divide the lower and upper half of salaries once again in half, as a result, half of all salaries are between them).  The box's mustache is 10 and 90 percentile (it is conditionally possible to consider their minimum and maximum salaries).  More details on how the payroll calculator is arranged and how to read the data: <a href="https://moikrug.ru/info/salaries">https://moikrug.ru/info/salaries</a> <br><br>  Recently, we have added to the calculator a histogram of the distribution of wages by their size, as well as a diagram of salary changes over time.  We also added the ability to exclude cities to the calculator filter to make it easier to view salaries by region.  Also now on the filter, you can select the time period for which you need to know the salary. <br><br><hr><br><h1>  Total salary change </h1><br>  Over the past six months, the average median salary throughout the IT industry as a whole grew by 5.9%, from 85,000 to 90,000 rubles.  Half of all wages is in the range between 58,000 and 135,000 rubles.  The increase was due to the increase in wages, which were below the average in Moscow and St. Petersburg, as well as due to the increase in wages, which were above the average in other cities. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ar/ad/xd/aradxdjymset3xrxohdboj9ylnm.png" alt="image"><br><br><hr><br><h2>  Salaries for major IT specializations </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/r3/x7/22/r3x722ctjj_2acsxgixjie-fpe8.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The growth of the average median wage is observed in the field of HR, development, administration, design and management.  The fall is observed in marketing, support and analytics. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/lc/is/iw/lcisiwiq119mgmqmixpqwvwineq.png" alt="image"><br><br>  If you look at the regions, then the growth of the average median wage in all regions is observed only in development, and the fall is only in marketing.  In the Eichar and design growth is observed only in Moscow and St. Petersburg. <br><br>  In other areas there is a movement of salaries in one direction and in the other direction at the same time, depending on the region.  For example, you can see that the overall increase in the average salary in the administration comes at the expense of Moscow and the regions, in management - at the expense of Moscow, despite the fall in the average salary in these areas in St. Petersburg. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/8y/f2/yj/8yf2yjelsvgneifsjzsmstkkfx0.png" alt="image"><br><br><hr><br><h2>  Software Developer Salaries </h2><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/w0/d0/ly/w0d0lycpiuiwurvrytr0pxuqclu.png" alt="image"><br><br>  For all the specializations of the development, we see an increase in the average median salary, especially strong in game development and the frontend. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/p4/n2/us/p4n2uswbxnmkucqd1mvoyf1_bwy.png" alt="image"><br><br>  When splitting into regions, unequivocal growth is observed only in the frontend in Moscow and St. Petersburg.  For all other specializations, there is growth in some regions and a fall in others. <br><br>  For example, the overall wage growth in game development comes at the expense of St. Petersburg and the regions, despite its fall in Moscow.  A wage increase in desktop development - due to its growth in the regions, despite the fall in Moscow and St. Petersburg. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xd/js/6y/xdjs6yjtxz5jnhcqg--q5zo9gpg.png" alt="image"><br><br><hr><br><h2>  Executives salaries </h2><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/l4/e2/oq/l4e2oqtcjztw4olke85k3jwukgw.png" alt="image"><br><br><hr><br><h2>  Analyst salaries </h2><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/tk/9c/f0/tk9cf05yls03hq_dujg5d_rqknk.png" alt="image"><br><br><hr><br><h2>  Designer salaries </h2><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/-y/4q/i5/-y4qi5zkypqncqgufirjmt_lu9k.png" alt="image"><br><br><hr><br><h2>  Salaries of quality specialists </h2><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/3-/js/wp/3-jswpqsk3w66of7tbjld4ayz5s.png" alt="image"><br><br><hr><br><h2>  Salaries for maintenance professionals </h2><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/_f/hq/hn/_fhqhnsajve7s-aeq4womcpzaso.png" alt="image"><br><br><hr><br><h2>  Salaries of HR Specialists </h2><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wm/f2/c2/wmf2c2jq3dupkh2wpcj3y9_cheo.png" alt="image"><br><br><hr><br><h1>  Salaries of developers by programming languages </h1><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gl/pt/x_/glptx_vllnnwgc57t9jysjtdymy.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The highest growth of the average median salary is observed in the languages ‚Äã‚Äãof mobile development for iOS - Objective-C and Swift, as well as in the frontend language - JavaScript.

It is interesting to compare this salary with the salary of outsourcing companies that perform the same function as freelancers just do it on a large scale. <br><br>  By the way, from <a href="https://habr.com/company/moikrug/blog/417611/">recent times</a> on ‚ÄúMy Circle‚Äù you can not only leave your salary, but also give marks to the companies in which you work.  All the companies for which we received a salary for this report already have a rating from their employees. <br><br><hr><br>  <b>We thank everyone who points out their salaries in the service, contributing to the creation of a more open and structured IT market!</b> <br><br>  <a href="https://habr.com/company/moikrug/blog/347440">See also our last year</a> ‚Äôs salary <a href="https://habr.com/company/moikrug/blog/347440">report</a> for the second half of 2017. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/420391/">https://habr.com/ru/post/420391/</a></p>
