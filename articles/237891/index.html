Today we will talk about the procedure for submitting presentations and finished projects, as well as reveal the composition of the jury of the competition. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><h4>  How to make and submit work </h4><br>  It may seem that the development stage is still far away, but now is the time to put in order your presentations and videos and add ‚Äúspecial effects‚Äù to them. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"

      According to the rules, ideas should be submitted in the format of pdf presentations or videos that are publicly available.  They need to describe the essence of the project, its target audience and, in fact, the value of the project for Central Asia. <br><br>  Those involved in development should post a link to the working finished project in the presentation itself, or in the description of the video.  In this case, the order of submission of various projects is as follows.  It is necessary to pay special attention to it, this is a kind of memo for developers: <br><br>  1. Mododels must undergo a review and post a ready-made mod to the <a href="http://www.res-mods.ru/">www.res-mods.ru</a> resource no later than October 15.  Due to the fact that only Update 9.3 for World of Tanks was released yesterday, do not forget to indicate in the presentation for which version of the game the mod was made.  If he will work in 9.3 - well, but not necessarily neither for participation, nor for victory. <br><br>  2. Mobile application developers need to upload them to the application store of the (or those) platforms for which / which the application was made.  If everything is ready, do it right now.  For example, in the AppStore, an application review can take from several days to a couple of weeks, and a link to it in a video or presentation will be needed already on October 15. <br><br>  3. With web resources, everything is simple: in the presentation or video description there must be a link to a working resource. <br><br>  4. For desktop applications, you also need to give a link to the resource where you can download it. <br><br>  All works will be tested for viruses and moderation for compliance with the rules of the competition after October 15.  For projects that were finalized during the competition, please indicate in the presentation what exactly was finalized. <br><br>  A little advice.  If you feel that you have created a really good product, do not be too lazy to bring the presentation into an accessible and readable form.  You can already look at the presentations of other participants and pull up to their level (or even higher).  It is possible that it is you who will present your project at the final event, and today's work on the presentation will be a good start for the future. <br><br><h4>  Composition of the jury and final parting </h4><br>  So, after 11:59 pm Moscow time, on October 15, contest participants will no longer be able to edit projects and make changes to presentations. <br><br>  Further work will be the primary screening and go to the jury.  The following judges and their teams will evaluate them and identify the winner: <br><br>  1. <b>Andrei Yarantsev</b> , head of the publishing division of Wargaming - chairman of the jury.
