  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Copy of Xperia X10 or Chinese SonyEricsson</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <b>Introduction</b> <br><br>  I have long wanted to buy Chinese exotics.  For over a year, I looked through the hammer and finally found what I liked.  The price of the issue is 1800 rubles for the device, 750 rubles for a micro SD card of 8 GB, and the delivery is about 1,100 rubles.  Buying this device, I consciously was ready for anything, and in principle, I already said goodbye to my money.  What has come is indeed pleasing to both the eye and the hand, but there are flaws.  First things first.  I will say that the review will be a budget one, and the apparatus itself is not an elite. <br><br>  <b>Traffic!</b>

    <a name="habracut"></a>  <b>post office</b> <br><br>  Mail seems to have begun to be corrected.  Sending by regular mail from Singapore was 17 days.  This is good news.  On Sunday, the package was received at the post office and brought home.  The usual white box, all intact. <br><br><img src="http://img683.imageshack.us/img683/6348/80830442.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Box with the device</b> <br><br>  Nice box, also white.  On quality cardboard, there are no complaints about print quality.  Immediately struck by the inscription about the size of the screen - 3.2 "in the description on the hammer, it was stated that 3.8".  Well, God bless them, with the size.  In the white ‚Äúsemi-box‚Äù, another one is black, with obvious mimicry for elite products.  In fact, the usual cardboard with embossed and varnish. <br><br><img src="http://img444.imageshack.us/img444/4832/sg208022.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="http://img443.imageshack.us/img443/9827/sg208027.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Inside the box is just an ordinary, red, slightly rumpled life, a piece of red flimsy cellophane, in which the phone is just lying. <br><br><img src="http://img541.imageshack.us/img541/4592/sg208028.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Included are: <br>  - 2 batteries (2800 mAh each); <br>  - headset headphones (normal); <br>  - charging, in which you can charge the battery or phone separately with the battery, or both, which, by the way, is quite convenient.  Charging has an American plug (flat, not round); <br>  - adapter under our sockets; <br>  - wire for a connection with a computer.  Connector from Sony Eriksson. <br><br><img src="http://img651.imageshack.us/img651/6683/sg208031.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Turn the device in the hands</b> <br><br>  The device is not heavy.  Build quality is very good.  There are no creaks.  The battery cover opens easily, but holds securely.  The plastic in the lid is covered with Soft Touch, and in general, the materials of the device are very high quality.  There is no metal.  Around plastic, but again, good.  The seller claimed that the device has metal parts of the case, but in any case I am satisfied. <br><br><img src="http://img641.imageshack.us/img641/9227/sg208032.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="http://img180.imageshack.us/img180/9025/sg208034.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="http://img251.imageshack.us/img251/4888/sg208040.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="http://img121.imageshack.us/img121/3846/sg208036.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Hot swappable memory card is not provided.  The memory card is simply inserted and does not even snap into place.  The connector for it is located under the flash.  I am sure that you will find it on the last photo. <br><br>  Separately, I will show the battery, on which it is written that it holds as much as 2800 mAh, but I am tormented by doubts on this issue.  Unfortunately, there is no way to measure. <br><br><img src="http://img155.imageshack.us/img155/6731/sg208038.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Turning on</b> <br><br>  So.  Sims are inserted, the battery is installed.  The lid is closed.  Ready to start.  Let's start. <br>  The device welcomes us in English.  Sounds gadsky polyphony.  The display pleases.  Let me remind you that the QVGA display.  Noticeable grid pixels.  But in general, I am satisfied, because I did not expect more.  The phone is already coming with a protective film, but I will change it. <br><br><img src="http://img691.imageshack.us/img691/306/sg208043.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Desktop <br><img src="http://img692.imageshack.us/img692/5385/sg208045.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The phone has several "desktops".  If you scroll to the left, then we will go to the calendar, and if to the right, we will see the player. <br><br>  Phone menu <br><img src="http://img690.imageshack.us/img690/1029/sg208046.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The keyboard of the phone itself.  By the way, comfortable.  No problem.  The algorithm of working with two sim is simple, convenient and understandable. <br><img src="http://img88.imageshack.us/img88/5715/sg208047.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  SMS and text.  The phone has an on-screen keyboard.  SMS is convenient to dial, the sensor rarely misses, although the speed of dialing has not increased.  Unfortunately, despite the fact that the phone has a G-sensor, but the keyboard in SMS dialing mode does not turn over. <br><img src="http://img204.imageshack.us/img204/2557/sg208051.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Internet and communication. <br>  The phone has GPRS and Wi-Fi.  GPRS works properly.  From browsers there is a choice of Opera 4.2 Russian or Opera 5.0 English.  I put the English.  It works well, there are no problems.  Wi-Fi sees, but failed to connect, as it found only secured networks.  There is also a bluetooth.  Here, without any special comments.  Just like everyone else. <br><img src="http://img821.imageshack.us/img821/1784/sg208054.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="http://img153.imageshack.us/img153/6572/sg208057.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  From nice features - Java applications can be minimized. <br><img src="http://img695.imageshack.us/img695/8560/sg208061.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Well, leave the picture "in the night" <br><img src="http://img171.imageshack.us/img171/7659/sg208065.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  What more can be said? <br><br>  Sound - the sound of its quality and volume upset, I expected more from the Chinese phone.  The quality of melodies ‚Äúno alle‚Äù is ringing quietly.  Thank God I have a habit of using the sound of a landline phone as a ringtone, it saves.  There is no lauded noisy.  You can put mp3, midi on the call. <br><br>  Camera.  I will not even say or show anything.  On the back cover is written 12 megapixels.  In fact, the camera is not just bad, it is just, just, HORRIBLE!  Honest word guys! <br><br>  Video.  3gp, avi, mp4.  Converted.  It does not slow down. <br><br>  Famous tv.  Good catches only at the window.  But in the absence of a better telly, and so come down. <br><br>  The sensor is average.  Sometimes misses sometimes fails.  Very quickly scrolling contacts.  But generally not annoying <br><br>  Vibro - average, in the case and pocket you can not feel. <br><br>  The quality of communication is good.  I hear well and I hear without distortion <br><br>  Contacts (phone book).  One common on two SIM cards. <br><br>  Player.  Standard 3.5 Jack <br><br>  Interface.  Some crookedness annoys a little. <br><br>  Russification - does not make smile.  It's all serious.  The font is really crooked in some places.  But I always use English by default, so for me it doesn't matter. <br><br>  Memory capacity 78 mb, micro SD support up to 8 GB inclusive. <br><br>  Once again I will say that there is Wi-Fi. <br><br>  <b>Conclusion</b> <br><br>  In principle, the device has left a pleasant impression.  Beats off their money.  Although there are little things that I would like to fix.  But do not forget about the price.  For such a price, with such functions, it is hard to find a phone in Russia.  I am glad about the presence of Wi-fi, I would also like 3g, the sensor is more lively, the android operating system, a larger display and a camera with real 12 pixels and of course a thoughtful interface. <br><habracut></habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/96932/">https://habr.com/ru/post/96932/</a></p>
