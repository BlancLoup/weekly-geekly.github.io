The output often becomes an external hard drive or a cheaper option: a container for several hard drives at once.  About one of these containers and will be discussed in this review: i-Stor iS601. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Equipment </h4>

At the same time in the picture, except as a single USB port and connector for the power adapter, is not detected. <br><br><h4>  Appearance </h4><br><br>  i-Stor iS601 is a chrome "safe" in which you can insert up to two 3.5-inch SATA hard drives.  The device is made without any frills: just a small but rather weighty metal box with a plastic front panel.  Something like a toy system unit: only functions are not toy. <br><br>  The case is a little rough, metal is felt.  Bottom made round rubber feet that do not allow the device to crawl on the table.  In order to install hard disks in a container, a long and painful study of the instructions is not required: simply remove the cover, insert the disks, connect to the network, then to the computer and - voila!  By the way, without a front cover, the device is somewhat similar to a toaster, only the hard drive is performed by the hard drive. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/89f/f47/48e/89ff4748e503cb3495a9e47b41cc3641.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/cf9/539/8a5/cf95398a54e88660ef35b9a0072c39ba.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  On the back side are the USB interface, the power connector, the power button and the opening of the Kensington Lock (conveniently, that's just not clear why I need to lock the container with a key if the disks can be pulled out?). <br><br>  Inside, there is a cooler that will cool the hard drives during operation.  The noise level is quite low.  Approximately the same as the laptop works, so it practically does not interfere. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/842/084/e7a/842084e7a21370a33ae402ecba890c7e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Under the front panel there is a mode switch and LEDs that report on the operation of hard drives and the presence of power.  Hard drives are inserted effortlessly.  They are not visible behind the lid, but because of the front grille and the rear fan, the cooling is good; overheating does not happen. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bc1/e56/e7d/bc1e56e7d92d4398184a2de45cf5db34.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Functional </h4><br><br>  Personally, I was upset that, unlike the older iS602, the 601st cannot create RAID 0 and RAID 1 arrays, so only Non-RAID has to be content.  But the support of large volumes (more than 2 TB) is encouraging.  There was an opportunity to test hard drives ‚Äúonly‚Äù on 1 TB and 500 GB.  As a result: the disc was recognized by the system without problems, quickly indexed and after a minute was ready for battle. <br><br>  When connected to a computer, a container is defined as a standard disk drive (like a USB flash drive or external hard drive), that is, it is displayed as a removable disk.  It works on both a regular PC and a Mac, which I think will please Apple fans. <br><br>  Winchesters are determined immediately and, moreover, to work with them through such a container, they do not need to be formatted, which made me happy, because I did not want to lose all the data and collections.  In the iS602 model, when creating RAID 0 (the volume on two disks is summed up, but the reliability is low) or RAID 1 (the information is duplicated on two disks, but the reliability is greatly increased) you will still have to format both disks. <br><br>  The data transfer rate, of course, is lower than when using eSata, but it is still at a sufficient level, corresponding to the USB speed.  The average speed was at the level of 185 Mbit / s when writing and 271 Mbit / s when reading. <br><br>  The price of this device in Russia varies in the region of 2000‚Äì2500 rubles.  Taking into account the fact that it is possible to work with two disks at once in one case, I have no complaints about the price.  Although ... The same i-Stor 602 is not much more expensive than 2,800 rubles, and its advantages are clearly more. <br><br><h4>  Overall impression </h4><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/57b/129/2b9/57b1292b936b3e16791d674696320c7e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  iS601 is a decent copy in this price niche.  The device pleases with compactness, pleasant appearance and rather low price.  For many, it will fit well into the overall concept of the workplace. <br><br>  I think this container will be useful to those who lack the SATA connectors on the motherboard, and you need more hard drives, as well as lovers of Mac computers or currently popular netbooks. <br><br>  Pros: <br><br>  nice design <br>  * USB 2.0, <br>  * easy disk change, <br>  * Kensington Lock, <br>  * support for large volumes. <br><br>  Minuses: <br><br>  * the inability to create a RAID <br>  * lack of eSata. <br><br>  C you was Kuuuzya.
