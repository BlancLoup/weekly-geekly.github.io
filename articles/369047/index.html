  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Review of the only in Russia "smart" iron REDMOND SkyIron</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Sometimes manufacturers of equipment tend to pursue exclusivity.  So we have, for example, "the world's first Android 5.1 tablets among devices with an 8-inch screen."  Sounds funny?  Well, even if not funny, then somehow ... strained, or something.  In the case of the hero of our review, to dissemble and invent will not work at all desire.  Yes, it is not necessary.  REDMOND SkyIron is truly the first and so far the only iron in Russia with the ability to remotely control from a smartphone / tablet. <br><br> <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/redmond/blog/266380/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/59b/52d/3a0/59b52d3a044a634abbed5a8f10377361.jpg"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  We will say more, the REDMOND SkyIron iron is just one of the representatives of a whole line of home appliances that are remotely controlled via Bluetooth or via the Internet.  In the REDMOND Smart Home series, there are still multicookers, kettles, coffee makers, humidifiers and air purifiers, floor and kitchen scales, heaters.  All devices are distinguished by the fact that they have a built-in wireless module capable of receiving commands from other devices.  For submission of these commands developed application Ready for Sky.  It is available for iOS and Android and allows you to remotely manage the entire range of equipment of the REDMOND Smart Home line. <br><br>  By the way, are you probably aware that Smart Home translates as ‚ÄúSmart Home‚Äù?  Thus, the company REDMOND develops a new concept of smart home.  It does not require a separate cottage and significant financial investments for the installation of an intelligent system.  You can simply buy the devices you need and control them from any distance.  For example, still basking in bed in the morning, you can give a command to boil a kettle.  Well, or a coffee maker - make coffee.  In the slow cooker, you can put the ingredients in advance and start cooking lunch before the child comes home from school, while at work at this time.  The heater can be turned on in advance in order to be in a heated room upon arrival from work.  The use options are full.

      <br>
      How was it in, excuse me, ‚ÄúOur Rush‚Äù?  "We live in the most beautiful country, and everyone else envies us."  This is because the REDMOND Smart Home line is currently available only in Russia.  Sales started in the fall of 2015 (although some models appeared on the shelves at the end of 2014) and were very successful.  In 2016, the smart Redmond equipment will be available in Europe and the USA.  In the meantime - enjoy exclusive features. <br><br>  Take, for example, iron.  Many will now grin - well, why should he control via the Internet, will he iron things?  No, he will not.  The main point of REDMOND SkyIron remote control is safe.  Frequent history: a person leaves the house and after a while remembers that he forgot to turn off the iron.  And okay, if a person just goes to the dacha (you can return), and if he is sitting on a plane waiting for takeoff? <br><br>  Ok, most modern irons have the option to turn off automatically.  But auto-shutdown occurs after a certain time, and there are sometimes minutes to burn or cause a fire!  For example, parents went to visit and left the home child of primary school age, who wished not to go anywhere.  Then my mother remembers that she did not turn off the iron.  Until the device automatically turns off, it will take some time.  During this time, the child can: <br><br>  - get burnt <br>  - put the iron on some surface, ruining it (carpet, for example) <br>  - in the worst case - to set fire <br>  - play "mom strokes things" and spoil the expensive dress. <br><br>  And, by the way, the ‚Äúself-disconnected‚Äù iron left in the socket is easy to activate again.  If you basically do not leave small children alone at home (and elderly relatives too), then perhaps you have a cat or a dog.  A cat, for example, can get settled on a still warm ironing board and start licking its skin.  The board together with the iron will stagger from this, the iron will ‚Äúthink‚Äù that it is used, and it will not turn itself off.  Total - risk of a burn at a cat, probability of a fire at the owner. <br><br>  And a big dog can accidentally hit an ironing board, an iron can fall on some easily flammable surface ... How terrible to live, huh? <br><br>  All the above problems will help to avoid the REDMOND SkyIron iron with remote control.  Not sure if you turned it off?  Open the application on the phone and check.  If you really forgot, then turn it off.  If the child is at home, then you also block the inclusion of the iron (it will work again only on your team from Ready for Sky).  Simple, convenient, safe!  And, by the way, energy will help save - it is easier to turn off the iron from a smartphone than to wait for it to shut off. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c4e/d00/77d/c4ed0077d08b6eb021e4033233538191.jpg"><br><br>  We think that we have convinced you of the usefulness of the device.  Let's look at it more closely now. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/63e/7c5/36e/63e7c536eb7e1b35a0619d500ba582fe.jpg"><br><br><h2>  Specifications </h2><br>  ‚óè Model: SkyIron RI-C250S <br>  ‚óè Voltage: 220-240 V, 50 Hz <br>  ‚óè Power: 2200 W <br>  ‚óè Protection against electric shock: class I <br>  ‚óè Type of control: mechanical, remote (Ready for Sky technology) <br>  ‚óè Sole coating: ceramic <br>  ‚óè Water tank capacity: 350 ml <br>  ‚óè Steam boost: 125 g / min <br>  ‚óè Continuous steam: 25 g / min <br>  ‚óè Features and functions: <br>  - vertical steaming <br>  - strong steam blow <br>  - anti-scale protection <br>  - leakage protection <br>  - overheat protection <br>  - water spray <br>  - dry ironing <br>  - protection against leakage (‚ÄúDrop-stop‚Äù) <br>  - self-cleaning <br>  - auto power off (after 8 minutes if the iron is standing vertically; after 5 seconds if it is standing horizontally or fell) <br>  - child lock <br>  - work status LED indicator <br>  - hinge cord <br>  ‚óè Remote control: Bluetooth v4.0, Ready for Sky app runs on iOS 8.0+ and Android 4.3+ <br>  ‚óè Length of electric cord: 3 m <br><br>  The REDMOND SkyIron smart iron comes in a small box.  In the kit, in addition to the iron itself - a measuring cup, a service book and instructions.  Everything, as in the case of a regular iron. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/698/eb6/ce6/698eb6ce654fad9d1a62849763d66cf1.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/946/e14/62c/946e1462c432775f0151d3fca47c50f7.jpg"><br><br>  The iron is made of soft-touch glossy plastic (it is partially translucent), the assembly is perfect.  The buttons for spraying water and steam blow are pressed firmly, the heating force control rotates easily and smoothly, the cover of the water hole closes securely.  In short, there are no complaints about ergonomics. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/430/d38/143/430d38143cb6aa4f92268316507c3a84.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/718/ce6/c2e/718ce6c2eddead486227c96bd7cb2194.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7a1/534/5de/7a15345dedf6993ecd5f9da356e30e2d.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6f2/49e/77b/6f249e77b678b8de4831740943a58a03.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6e5/aa1/e30/6e5aa1e307fb4c507783f34542ed3d19.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/551/f03/121/551f03121e6095a825ea6d97f9811e52.jpg"><br><br>  The ‚Äúsole‚Äù of the iron is ideally smooth and has a special relief for more efficient stripping.  It is made of ceramic, it is a very safe and durable material.  The power cord is long, at the junction with the iron has a hinge. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bf7/ead/ffb/bf7eadffb897b880200c5750c7243372.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/55b/767/32a/55b76732a9fce94985a7ef00eaa829cc.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d9b/932/345/d9b932345d346843d6cfc04383308dd4.jpg"><br><br>  Although in general there is nothing outstanding in the design of the REDMOND SkyIron (as regards the arrangement of elements, everything is standard), I must say that the device looks attractive and bright.  There are several color options available - purple with white, purple with black, turquoise with black. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/54d/a17/1b7/54da171b7f6aaea7c61f4269039f6c93.jpg"><br><br>  On the temperature controller there are marks with different types of fabrics.  The manual is available their detailed transcript with recommendations for ironing. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b08/525/bbe/b08525bbe5c4306ba4a41534d6a2385f.jpg"><br><br>  The Calc Clean button activates the function of complete self-cleaning of all viscera and the sole of the iron using steam.  It is recommended to clean the iron in this way up to 2-3 times per month, depending on the hardness of the water used.  Detailed instructions for self-cleaning are given in the instructions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/316/8de/252/3168de252395d816b4e7da110f97cb1a.jpg"><br><br>  Speaking of water.  The iron also has the ‚ÄúAnti-scale‚Äù option, which reduces the water hardness / level of calcium and other salts in the water.  As a result, there is practically no white bloom on the heater, which can get on the clothes. <br><br>  Of the other functions, we note the proprietary system ‚ÄúKaplya-Stop‚Äù.  You can be sure that the iron will not miss a drop of water from the tank and calmly iron the most delicate fabrics. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/923/8f4/14b/9238f414b37d1cceec2fd7cb8c3bd14a.jpg"><br><br>  We should also note the auto shut-off system REDMOND SkyIron.  If you leave the iron in a vertical position, heating the sole will turn itself off after 8 minutes.  If the iron is in a horizontal position for more than 5 seconds without moving, it will also automatically turn off.  Similar shutdown after 5 seconds - in case of accidental fall.  When the device is turned off automatically, the buzzer beeps, and the LED on the handle flashes.  To continue ironing, simply lift the iron, the indicator of the heating of the sole will light up. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6b5/9a5/952/6b59a5952fdd5b9ac22baf5062ecabce.jpg"><br><br>  Well, the main characteristics were discussed, it‚Äôs time to talk about the most interesting thing - the process of controlling the iron from a smartphone (well, or a tablet). <br><br>  To do this, as already mentioned, you need to install the Ready for Sky application on your tablet or smartphone based on iOS version 8.0 or higher / Android 4.3 or higher (found in the official software catalog).  Then you need to create an account, add your device from the general list and ‚Äúmake friends‚Äù the iron with the program.  To connect devices, you need to hold the iron in the ‚Äúnose down‚Äù position.  Three short beeps will sound, and the indicator on the handle will flash until the ‚Äúconnection‚Äù is established. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/04d/130/243/04d13024309933a70b4fc812d1e086ad.png" width="350"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/15e/ef2/1b8/15eef21b8acae2f6993c3a22972af384.png" width="350"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9fe/518/9b6/9fe5189b6d52e2e616b5fb2f659d2874.png" width="350"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/199/c91/6b6/199c916b611e5a0b59de2d4009e8232e.png" width="350"><br><br>  Please note - the management of "smart" home appliances REDMOND implemented via Bluetooth.  So there is a limit to the distance from which commands are accepted - up to 50 meters.  In reality, it can be much less, depending on the walls and other obstacles. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9a6/c22/920/9a6c2292055640e74e0e682a34198c50.jpg"><br><br>  Of course, there would be no point in the REDMOND Smart Home line, if they had not thought about the possibility of controlling from anywhere in the world via the Internet.  However, this will require another device.  It will act as an intermediary in the transfer of commands.  Any inexpensive smartphone based on Android 4.3+ with Bluetooth 4.0 support and Internet connection will do.  On this smartphone, you should install the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.readyforsky.gateway%26hl%3Dru">R4S Gateway</a> utility, it will redirect your requests. <br><br>  As an intermediary, you can use any unnecessary smart or tablet.  If there are no such people in your house, then you can buy a camera device, now there are options from 1,500 rubles (what is locked up is not important).  And also pay attention to the new offer from REDMOND and MTS - a special smartphone-Gateway with a pre-installed R4S Gateway application and a SIM-card with a <a href="http://multivarka.pro/catalog/sky_home/redmond_mts_gateway/">special tariff</a> .  The tariff will cost you 7.5 rubles per month.  It is not intended for calls or SMS, as well as for access to the Internet somewhere other than Ready for Sky servers.  Agree - the amount is ridiculous.  And the connection via the mobile Internet is more reliable than through Wi-Fi.  Well, you never know, the provider will ‚Äúfall‚Äù, the router will hang ... There is a kit from MTS of 3 495 rubles.  Not cheap - a fact.  However, when you buy one device from the Smart Home series in the official REDMOND stores (including an <a href="http://multivarka.pro/catalog/smart_tech/%3Futm_source%3Dpromo%26utm_medium%3Dmail%26utm_campaign%3Damr">online storefront</a> ), you can purchase the Gateway for 2,995 rubles.  When buying two Redmond devices, the price of the ‚Äútransmitter‚Äù will be halved and will amount to 1,745 rubles.  Well, if you buy three smart Redmond devices at once, then you will receive a ‚Äúgateway‚Äù as a gift! <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/886/c2a/2aa/886c2a2aab9d2f02b495b925fca980fa.png"></div><br>  Well, back to Ready for Sky.  The iron control interface looks like this: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/896/507/5a3/8965075a3620e89c69455f76890d2c7b.png" width="350"></div><br>  You immediately see the status of the iron - it is turned off or on.  And what is more interesting - the position of the iron in space is displayed.  For example, you will know whether the child touched the iron (or maybe a pet dropped it).  In addition, knowing the position of the device, you can not be afraid to turn it on, being in another room.  You will come - and immediately begin to iron, without waiting for the maximum heating.  Of course, you should not do this if the iron is sole with some delicate fabric. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c0e/4c8/963/c0e4c896311e743ecc1eb79869ea4086.png" width="350"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/227/93d/0a0/22793d0a08fce11e8faa8cd8556d6f0c.png" width="350"><br>  <i>The iron stands upright, you can turn on the heat.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a69/ac3/d9d/a69ac3d9d72870dcdb7c240227204697.png" width="350"><br>  <i>Someone knocked SkyIron, and he hung on the cord, or a smart iron fell off the table, or right now is in the hands of your curious child.</i> <br><br>  Ready for Sky allows you to remotely turn off or turn on the REDMOND SkyIron, as well as activate the child protection function.  The child with all the desire can not turn on the iron, it can be done only from the mobile application. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/227/93d/0a0/22793d0a08fce11e8faa8cd8556d6f0c.png" width="350"></div><br>  Well, it's time to sum up.  Before us is a high-quality iron with a lot of useful options.  Thanks to a ceramic sole with a special relief, it ideally slides on the fabric.  A strong steam blow will smooth out even the most capricious materials like flax.  The function of vertical steaming is useful for curtains, outerwear, any frills on dresses.  Sophisticated leak protection eliminates wet spots on clothing.  "Anti-scale" reduces the level of impurities in the water, which also saves your belongings.  Cord on the hinge - it's just convenient.  Self-cleaning function will extend the service life of the iron.  Auto-off when not in use and blocking children is important for safety. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c9a/7ad/37d/c9a7ad37dd5bc719679d350126175024.jpg"></div><br>  But in the case of REDMOND SkyIron, all these advantages are trifles.  The main distinguishing feature of REDMOND SkyIron is the ability to remotely control through an application for smartphones / tablets.  And, therefore, an increased level of security, which gives such control.  No need to puzzle if you turned off the iron and whether to return home.  Just look at the smartphone - off or on, in what position it is.  Your loved ones as well as pets will be safe.  And most importantly - peace of mind, because it is worth a lot! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d4a/06d/edd/d4a06dedddeb28f69c781e7249ee80d9.jpg"><br><br>  By the way, about the cost.  REDMOND SkyIron RI-C250S is now sold for <a href="http://multivarka.pro/catalog/utyugi/utyug_redmond_ri_c250s/">4,295 rubles</a> .  Irons from competitors with similar functions (but without control from a smartphone!) Cost about the same.  And even more expensive!  Here, as they say, ‚Äúproof‚Äù: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2aa/5ca/9bf/2aa5ca9bfaafe21691ecda7fb716b977.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/86c/c30/7ef/86cc307efe09634d792209f774b61329.png"><br><br>  At the same time, it should be understood that the remote control capability, which will save you a lot of time and nerves, is provided only by REDMOND SkyIron.  There are simply no other such irons in Russia! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/369047/">https://habr.com/ru/post/369047/</a></p>
