  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Windows 7 and USB modem HUAWEI E1550</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><h4>  A little background </h4><br><br>  For someone access to the Internet is an integral part of life, for someone something must, but for someone a privilege.  In my case, this is a privilege ... In our provincial town in the south-east of the Krasnodar Territory, the situation is at a very deplorable level (the local monopolist of STC, which provides access to the Internet using ADSL technology and several small offices that work with several districts via optical fiber) prices and quality of services leave much to be desired ... Yes, and fate decreed that there is no possibility to use the services of any of these offices.  On duty, and just for the soul, an Internet at least some, but necessary. <br><br>  I decided to purchase the MTS Connect package, which includes the HUAWEI E 1550 USB modem and a SIM card with a more or less favorable surfing rate.  In the customer service center, I carefully studied the box of this miracle, in which in the section ‚ÄúSystem Requirements‚Äù it was stated ‚ÄúAvailability of a standard USB interface, OS Windows XP / Vista, Mac OS X 10.4 / 10.5‚Äù.  The first question I have is whether this piece of hardware works with Windows 7 because I have been its user since the release of the first beta.  The center employee categorically replied, ‚ÄúNo, it won't work with Windows 7, the tests were carried out and gave a negative result ...‚Äù Noticing some uncertainty in his response to buy a package, I still decided and running to the car stuck the cherished piece of metal into the laptop ... With a sinking heart, I watched The process of installing drivers on Windows 7 RC x86 ... Two minutes later, I was enveloped in the world wide web, that is, everything was perfectly installed and worked without the slightest hint of failures and unstable work.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Having reached home with absolute certainty, I decided to connect the modem to the desktop, on which the same build of Windows 7 is installed, only x64.  Almost immediately, I received a notification that the driver installation failed.  I can not say that I was saddened by the fact that I made a useless purchase - from personal experience I made sure that Windows 7 works and the difference is only in the bitness of the OS.  The first thing that came to mind was the search for the corresponding driver in the network, but 2 hours of persistent searches did not lead to the solution of the problem.  Partly ... Having connected the modem to the laptop, I got into the device manager to analyze the situation.  A modem is defined as a regular CD-drive, which contains drivers and software for accessing the Internet (MTS Connect).  Googling on the problem of determining the optical drive of Windows OS came across an <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/314060">article</a> in the help and support of Windows, which considered one of the solutions to the problem. <br><br><h4>  Small solution to small difficulties </h4><br><br>  1. Go to the registry editor (with administrator rights) <br>  2. Find the following branch: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE \ SYSTEM \ CurrentControlSet \ Control \ Class \ {4D36E965-E325-11CE-BFC1-08002BE10318} <br>  3. Remove the UpperFilters and LowerFilters parameters from it. <br>  4. Restart the machine <br>  5. Problem solved <br>  Note ‚ÄúIf the LowerFilters parameter is missing, this article, unfortunately, will not be able to help anything anymore,‚Äù caught up with some melancholy :) but it didn‚Äôt belong to my case.  After the reboot, the modem was successfully determined and earned. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/69653/">https://habr.com/ru/post/69653/</a></p>
