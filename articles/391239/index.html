Any extraordinary gadget is a risk.  However, some like to take risks.  In the history of Sony, for example, there were a lot of risky projects, fans of the brand remember them well and love.  We can recall the electric dog Aibo or the dancing Rolly stereo speaker.  And at the end of 2015, Sony released another unusual gadget - Sony BSP60. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/710/f63/654/710f63654b6a4e83a20f2bfdcd1e4e0a.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>What is Sony BSP60?</b> <br>  For the most complete picture of the device, imagine a cross between a wireless speaker, an ‚Äúintelligent‚Äù alarm clock, a dancing robot with voice control and interactive interaction.  Although Sony itself is positioning Sony BSP60 precisely as a wireless speaker (or rather as a smart speaker). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e8f/6d0/c09/e8f6d0c09acc4a9892a78097a89a8330.jpg">

      The device has a number of smart features that can not boast of any wireless speaker and no alarm clock.  With the help of voice control, you can set an alarm, make requests via ‚ÄúOK, Speaker‚Äù, get voice information about the weather and the like.  However, one of the main features of the device, in my opinion, is his ‚Äúdance‚Äù abilities, which can brighten up the next evening behind the monitor.  Well, or wake you up in the morning. <br><br>  <b>Design</b> <br>  After opening the box with the Sony BSP60 you will find in it a monolithic glossy ball of black color, almost devoid of any openings or markings.  Behind this mysterious appearance lies a real joker who wakes up immediately after turning on the power.  On the front panel is a small but informative OLED display.  When a column is simply turned on, it displays time and four touch buttons.  Just above the display is the NFC area where smartphones and other portable electronics should be brought in to establish a fast wireless connection. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fea/861/a4c/fea861a4c3034a039697495e5fca40c0.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/28d/486/529/28d486529a9948a191e4268c4826b552.jpg"><br><br>  After moving the column to the music mode, it will funny raise the ‚Äúears‚Äù, which are underlined by the changing LED backlight.  Below them are the speakers.  In the lower part of the body there is a slot for a microphone.  At the back you will see the Sony logo and a micro USB connector for charging.  At the bottom - compact rubber wheels (provide mobility of the column), a hole with a button for forced reloading and the cherished inscription "Made In Japan". <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/324/1ee/a10/3241eea106264baa9067dcf1b03481ad.jpg"><br><br>  The clever Sony BSP60 speaker looks impressive.  So impressive that you forget to pay attention to the technical features of this interactive device.  But we don‚Äôt have the right to skip the description of the functionality and specifications of Sony BSP60, so we‚Äôll continue to get acquainted with this smart speaker. <br><br>  <b>Functionality</b> <br>  It does not make sense to compare the Sony BSP60 with other wireless speakers, since this device is difficult to attribute to any of the existing classes of devices. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1bb/26f/36d/1bb26f36decc4b1897176040882087af.jpg"><br><br>  To configure the speaker, you need to install Smart Bluetooth Speaker BSP60 on your smartphone.  After that, you can use the voice commands to find out the weather, date or time, set the alarm, turn on the music, and so on.  This is from the useful.  As for the entertainment component, then the BSP60 is ahead of the rest: it will dance to you with music, and twitch it with ears, and play with light.  It seems to be not so bright, but in fact this column will cheer up even the dullest user.  Especially great, it looks in a room with minimalist lighting or in the dark.  And it will make the sloths move: if they still manage to restrain themselves, so as not to dance in a pair with the BSP60, then make sure that an expensive gadget in the heat of the next dance does not fall off the table or the bollard, they still have to.  However, this will be true only if you use a smart column in a very small space.  A square measuring 30x30 centimeters will be enough for all BSP60 maneuvers. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/5RYWGxBxq0A%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhzrNP8PcupZWnqYVJgvHfdeJJG3w" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Voice control functions without complaints even when there are extraneous noises in the room.  Russian language is supported by default - the column has no problems with it.  And it is very happy. <br><br>  <b>Sound and specifications</b> <br>  As noted above, the device boasts support for NFC, voice control, two compact broadband speakers.  The power of the latter is 2.5 W, so keep in mind that using the BSP-60 for organizing a noisy party will not work.  But for the home or office there is enough sounding power.  There are no questions to the quality of reproduction.  The actual battery life in music playback mode reaches 7 hours. <br><br>  The official specifications indicate that the smart speaker is compatible with devices based on Android 4.4 KitKat OS or newer, but in fact it can also work with iOS devices.  However, in this case, rely on the full functionality is not worth it.  For example, with the iPhone, it easily connects via Bluetooth and works as expected.  But about any voice functions of the speech does not go. <br><br>  <b>General impressions</b> <br>  Smart column BSP60 left behind only positive emotions.  First of all, this is a really useful gadget: here you will find both a wireless speaker with high-quality playback, and a smart alarm clock, and just an interlocutor who will call you by name.  Secondly, it is an interactive toy, lifting your mood at the right moment.  Children react especially well to it.  Kids like it, but pets probably do not. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a32/d9d/207/a32d9d207250499e9653dd3ea0a037aa.jpg"><br><br>  You can buy a Sony BSP60 smart speaker for 20,990 rubles.  Someone may think that it is expensive for a wireless speaker, but you should bear in mind that this is not a simple column, but a unique gadget.  True, a year and a half ago, with the old course, it could have cost 9 thousand rubles. <br><br>  <b>The main features of the column</b> : <br><ul><li>  voice control; </li><li>  Connect to a Bluetooth audio source with A2DP, AVRCP, HFP and NFC support; </li><li>  wireless headset operation (echo and noise canceling omnidirectional microphone); </li><li>  speaker system: 2 broadband speakers with a total power of 2.5 W; </li><li>  weight: 349 g; </li><li>  Size: 100 √ó 100 √ó 85 mm. </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/391239/">https://habr.com/ru/post/391239/</a></p>
