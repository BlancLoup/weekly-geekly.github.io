This exhibition of technologies <a href="http://www.expocentr.ru/ru/expoinex/intersvet/">related to lighting</a> , runs since 1994 and is the largest in the CIS. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1af/621/bb6/1af621bb6bd545ed821a3a984f61797a.jpg"><br><br>  That there was an interesting - read under a cat. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Exhibition </h4><br>  A notable trend of this year has become a variety of lenses for LEDs, which give uneven lighting:

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7ea/6e3/fa4/7ea6e3fa4b284ea5bf89f418351265d0.jpg"><br><br>  With the help of such lenses you can create lamps that will shine brightly in one direction, but weakly in others: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2dd/4ce/5c8/2dd4ce5c81f44c37824b42a4175a9b44.jpg"><br><br>  This is used, for example, in the lighting of parks - lights shine exactly on the track, without illuminating in vain the bushes on the sides: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ada/475/cdc/ada475cdc83c4cb38d1f95e31cd529c2.jpg"><br><br>  This allows you to either put less powerful LEDs, saving on electricity, or increase the brightness of the lighting space with little or no cost.  The LED under this lens looks funny: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0a6/dd6/868/0a6dd68684034e81af81add2cf8f53c9.jpg"><br><br>  Another set of lamps with filament LEDs, as the usual form factor for the cartridge E27, and long: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0d7/e9b/a17/0d7e9ba17b664b298bb1539550d06b20.jpg"><br><br>  If you look closely, then there is a little visible structure of the lamp.  There are many small crystals of ultraviolet light-emitting diodes, filled with phosphor on top, which transforms UV into white light.  Pros - the uniformity of illumination and the absence of a point source. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bf1/ab2/74b/bf1ab274bd634ad7a4eeaab1e6394bdc.jpg"><br><br>  Some even showed LED light bulbs in the form of a ring.  Here it is, for example, the Chinese: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/af1/855/68f/af185568f2654cdc94952eeb295c5b63.jpg"><br><br>  It is not very clear what sense it is in the ring, any other configuration shines no worse, but they are very proud of it: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c05/497/8a6/c054978a6355405588b990b88c0c8747.jpg"><br><br>  And they even want agents: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/09c/c49/e22/09cc49e22f6a4752bdeeca199790bfbf.jpg"><br><br>  The number of LED lamps is almost unchanged from the previous year.  But there is a much more varied lighting and decorations on LEDs: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/105/726/1b6/1057261b61014e77b7aead5a85daf374.jpg"><br><br>  Traditionally, because the exhibition works in the winter, a lot of attention is paid to it in the new year: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/442/7cc/9be/4427cc9be4eb42da9798c62a52c1bee4.jpg"><br><br>  In this form, their products show both manufacturers and just salespeople: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9b4/3ee/ad5/9b43eead5bab4dddbfd72028671d02f6.jpg"><br><br>  This year, the organizers even arranged the ‚ÄúStreet of New Year's Storefronts‚Äù competition: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/51b/73c/4a6/51b73c4a6aaa43e9b7d743963a724d76.jpg"><br><br>  Not very well that part of the New Year's exhibition just migrated from last year: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/21b/3c0/459/21b3c0459ef04825951928acd1187140.jpg"><br><br>  There were also things indirectly related to lighting, but because of this, no less interesting.  For example, a Russian company (3dmid.ru) makes electronic circuits right on the body elements: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5df/f7f/e70/5dff7fe7051644bfacc9aea7b5efd42f.jpg"><br><br>  Applications mass - for example, you can make a very compact key fob car alarm due to the fact that there is no need for a bunch of structural elements - the board is the very inner surface of the keychain: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/045/e15/7c0/045e157c0085488eafd64e379a6233dd.jpg"><br><br>  Read their <a href="http://www.3dmid.ru/">website</a> , the technology is described in some detail there, it is interesting. <br>  They also somehow made a multivibrator on an ... egg shell: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/88d/48c/211/88d48c21124d4035b1d332bd8bc0cf9c.jpg"><br><br>  Another company (also Russian) showed a line of sealants and compounds for various applications: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a11/3ed/6c2/a113ed6c28ac482bb9d5520f17f97df6.jpg"><br><br>  For example, they can seal boards and lamps for work on the street and even in water: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/458/62f/e72/45862fe721b94b0d876edf9d8e9697e6.jpg"><br><br>  Or foam mastic (right), which is both moisture and vibration, and thermal protection, and does not support combustion: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cfd/674/f8f/cfd674f8f3e2437d911b221ad815d5fd.jpg"><br><br>  In the next pavilion there is a machine (based on Kuka roboruki) for applying two-component sealants: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b3e/8a5/152/b3e8a51529ed4415a821f368bf4713a8.jpg"><br><br>  The problem with their application is that they start to harden after mixing and in the whole volume - if you make 10 liters of the mixture at once, you need to spend all of them on the ‚Äúlifetime‚Äù of the sealant, otherwise it will harden in the whole volume at once - in the tank, in tubes and nozzle.  Therefore, they come up with tricky machines for mixing: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/829/d25/66b/829d2566b48f4f58a1139b86cd4f4d87.jpg"><br><br>  She, for example, the nozzle is not simple, but is a long tube with partitions, in which the components of the sealant are mixed together during the passage through it: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9d1/c52/2fe/9d1c522fe05246cabd699614227ba227.jpg"><br><br>  And here, for example, the Russian <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2598%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B4%25D1%2583%25D0%25BA%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B0">induction</a> lamps of the company <a href="http://darlight.ru/">Dar Light</a> : <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b68/769/23d/b6876923d2f04675875afe8fc85a09f5.jpg"><br><br>  The cost of such a lamp is lower than the cost of a similar LED power, and the service life is higher.  And they have an even spectrum and high color rendering index than many LEDs cannot boast of. <br><br>  The company " <a href="http://www.rusimpuls.ru/">Impulse</a> " makes a variety of electronic scoreboards.  They do not produce LEDs, but absolutely anyone can make a board: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d2f/135/6d3/d2f1356d388142eebee4030f20f72c3a.jpg"><br><br>  And these are different body profiles for lamps.  Inside - grooves for the board with LEDs: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9b7/8c5/91d/9b78c591d7ba4e86b29809efcfd33837.jpg"><br><br>  Different-different - matte, transparent, translucent, with lenses, with lenses, shock-proof, and so on. <br><br>  It was a little smart home: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/358/4c0/912/3584c091207b4ab1ab078231cfd84ab5.jpg"><br><br>  But not very much and somehow sluggish. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3b5/bbb/a64/3b5bbba64de94a7f894659832ada4ad2.jpg"><br><br>  But this thing reminded me of the turret from Portal: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/629/bfa/e2e/629bfae2e23f4a948e2a1e4aae7bd85c.jpg"><br><br>  To go, she, however, has not yet learned, but rotated in all directions, shining with a panel, just fine. <br><br>  Here is another company showing a flexible LED panel screen.  It is simple and easy to mount on any curved surface - even columns, even angles, at least leave half of it on the wall, and another on the ceiling: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/80b/e38/9d6/80be389d65c247a1982dbd3a415689d2.jpg"><br><br>  But the company, which did not bring anything interesting, therefore shows girls: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/14b/dc8/74f/14bdc874ffb745c2a41f60cc8ca0bc26.jpg"><br><br>  This company has not brought any girls, or something interesting, but it does not interest anyone: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/059/28d/532/05928d532e974fdb99f21c8adaa6e768.jpg"><br><br>  Near dancing incomprehensible thing.  The girls danced better: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0e3/5d3/e2f/0e35d3e2f44d47d9b28b7bb09d0b4af6.jpg"><br><br>  Several manufacturers have attended not to increase the brightness, but to improve the quality of the LEDs - they are actively promoting light bulbs with a low ripple level: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/055/46a/59a/05546a59a2c04a6181ab4ceb6691287e.jpg"><br><br>  The Chinese do not traditionally bother with such things, because of what their stands often look like this on photos: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9b7/c4e/2c6/9b7c4e2c6c324869a84b74645e2b6466.jpg"><br><br>  The photo, by the way, is an interesting thing - a LED lamp in the form factor of a fluorescent tube, with which you can simply take and replace a fluorescent lamp (you just need to change the lamp starter to a special one from the kit).  A good solution for those who want to switch to LEDs with fluorescent lamps, but do not want to change the lamps.  And they are fed only on one side, and you can take it in hand and arrange fights with lightsabers. <br>  They are not very expensive - $ 3 per 60cm and $ 5 per 150-centimeter lamp.  Company website <a href="http://www.toppolighting.com/Product_lb/%26pmcId%3D5639548b-be72-4bdd-b530-d80665e48504.html">here</a> , but at retail they do not trade.  On Aliexpress there are similar, you can search for "led tube lamp t8". <br>  Although some Chinese still show lamps without flicker.  True, they make it easier - in their opinion, the inscription ‚ÄúNo flash‚Äù next to the price is quite enough: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/62f/b39/9ee/62fb399ee0ee45059ddcd6c3f47f2593.jpg"><br><br>  In general, often Chinese names are quite ... unusual sound.  No, if I ‚Äúget sucked‚Äù - there is such a river in the seaside, everything is fine: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7c2/1df/aa2/7c21dfaa2ef640ebaa4faf7adc19bea0.jpg"><br><br>  That this name made me smile after all: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f9f/1f5/4ce/f9f1f54ce1624c269b26e22f0e61a41c.jpg"><br><br>  Chinese comrades were allocated as many as two large pavilions.  True, not everyone was active there, the participation of some companies was limited to a shelf with three types of products and a sleeping Chinese on a chair nearby.  About the reasons for this already told <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/zorins/" class="user_link">zorins</a> in his <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/zorins/" class="user_link">livejournal</a> : <br><blockquote>  Why are there always a lot of Chinese stands at exhibitions? <br>  And the exhibition is small, and not quite on their subject.  Only in vain money spent. <br>  The answer is simple.  The trip to the exhibition is organized centrally, the package includes: flight, accommodation, built-up stand and even three meals a day. <br>  Then 70% of the costs will be compensated by the Chinese government through the industry association. <br>  And another 50% is compensated by the government of Shenzhen, through the Shenzhen Association. <br>  Here they are for these 20%. </blockquote><br>  In general, the Chinese exhibited everything that somehow shines, or at least has to do with light and lamps.  Power supplies: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0f3/a1b/f42/0f3a1bf42c7944708541aa7604de7421.jpg"><br><br>  Flashlights: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/986/278/016/986278016b44499b8d28675ccc990261.jpg"><br><br>  Big powerful ugly lamps: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d5e/76c/7cc/d5e76c7ccf5b4291b176e8ddbd10531b.jpg"><br><br>  Small, weak, but beautiful steampunk lamps: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d66/f54/00f/d66f5400fd7646cda03f78a3c3aeea4c.jpg"><br><br>  Wi-Fi controlled light bulbs and speakers: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2b3/527/b31/2b3527b317a74f92a4173f8473e873f4.jpg"><br><br>  Panel for demonstration of LEDs of different color temperature - from the coldest: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a34/633/fd8/a34633fd88304a5697b3f53ad4762500.jpg"><br><br>  To the warmest: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/96d/0ac/b2a/96d0acb2a8614097b084d8a649db0d76.jpg"><br><br>  A special Chinese suitcase for exhibitions, in which all products are compactly placed at once: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/844/8cf/cd7/8448cfcd73d84cf0876a78f65e108f53.jpg"><br><br>  But this is not the Chinese.  Fun lamp with powerful LEDs that require good cooling.  But it is necessary to get into the standard dimensions.  So you need to make cool long radiators: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6aa/8aa/64f/6aa8aa64ff3c42279ff04f8e54553a79.jpg"><br><br>  A separate pavilion was set aside for design and interior pieces - all sorts of chandeliers and sconces, most of them expensive and showy.  People there also went important and dressed in jackets: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/355/f63/1e8/355f631e858944388c7a712d26d6cb25.jpg"><br><br>  They sold beautiful sockets and switches, which cost as repairs with re-wiring in a single room: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b11/1cc/a79/b111cca79d684a358615132179d3615e.jpg"><br><br>  And fireplaces for 80,000 rubles: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/355/dde/973/355dde9730d24c4aba72460d9141741b.jpg"><br><br>  There, with a backpack and jeans, I was scared and uncomfortable, so I left it and started looking for something more familiar.  And found old friends. <br><br><h4>  Noolite </h4><br>  I have already written about Noolite <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/boxowerview/blog/165131/">many</a> <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/boxowerview/blog/168039/">times</a> .  I still use it at home and in the Madrobots office.  Having seen them at the exhibition, I, of course, did not miss the chance to drink free tea with sweets, say hello to <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/dima117/" class="user_link">dima117</a> and ask the director of nootechnics that they have a new one. <br><br><h5>  What's new </h5><br>  Motion sensors (PM111), temperature (PT112), and combined temperature-humidity (PT111) are manufactured and sold.  If the motion sensor has already been seen last year (and even <a href="http://geektimes.ru/post/240514/">wrote</a> on GT), and it has not changed: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f8e/ef6/847/f8eef6847c094ce9b450f013fa6bbb75.jpg"><br><br>  That temperature sensor turned from a black box in the prototype stage into a release device: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0d9/224/987/0d922498755847e9a042637c57127e9e.jpg"><br><br>  Inside it looks like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/359/247/d72/359247d72fff4d5999bc33fe161541b0.jpg"><br><br>  Actually, the temperature sensor itself is a small black dot above the contacts in the center of the board.  And contacts - this is the place for a humidity sensor - the board for different models is the same, it differs in firmware and in the presence of a sensor. <br>  The cool functionality of this sensor is the ability to work as a thermostat: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a4e/8d8/4e4/a4e8d84e41b34cad9a5596c81f2ca4c3.jpg"><br><br>  Switch the switch to thermostat mode, tie it to the receiver, set the desired temperature, and connect a heater to the unit.  All, now it will turn on the load on the unit when the temperature drops below the set value, and turn it off when exceeded.  The same functionality, but for humidity is on the combined unit - you can turn on the fan when the humidity level is exceeded, for example in the bathroom. <br><br>  The ethernet gateway (PR1132) is also being produced and sold, although this is not very fresh news - they have already <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/222663/">written</a> about it in Habr√©. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f6f/747/43e/f6f74743e21841e5ac6f707e9ba389b4.jpg"><br><br>  But now they have developed and posted in the AppStore the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/smart-home-noolite/id937247670%3Fmt%3D8%26ign-mpt%3Duo%253D2">official iOS application</a> for controlling the light through the router: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/631/906/f26/631906f266f048f3b0304bee1a79f84a.jpg"><br><br>  It does not yet have all the functionality planned, but what is - works, and is quite convenient.  The next step is an application for Android, it will be available for download in Play in a couple of weeks. <br><br>  But this is a novelty.  Transmitter board (MT1132) for controlling Noolite modules ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/82f/507/be2/82f507be2984415e8ebc53849c3cf171.jpg"><br><br>  Through the UART.  You want with Arduino, you want with RPi, you want from any other single-board device.  Yes, even with the Chinese router - there is also a UART.  For example, a demo stand with Arduino: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/71e/85a/3eb/71e85a3ebb8d4159bb6e993281e5dc1f.jpg"><br><br>  There, the program is simple - read the value of the variable with the ADC, convert to percentages, send a brightness setting command at this level.  But no one bothers to make a much more complex logic. <br><br>  They also finally decided to reduce the number of different variants of execution units in order to unify production and stop confusing people with a bunch of blocks: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/510/d6c/852/510d6c852b984d648deea0597efb3b6e.jpg"><br><br>  A new SU unit is a universal unit that replaces all previous ones.  I don‚Äôt have a block photo, unfortunately, only a manual.  But there it is clear that there is one more wire between the connection wires, closed.  For the time being, he locked - the block works as SL-blocks, in relay mode.  If you break it, for example a snack, the block will work as an SN / ST, with the possibility of load dimming.  I would prefer the switch, of course, but this option is not bad.  At least, the blocks can be configured at the time of installation, rather than buying a strictly specified number of those and other blocks. <br><br>  Their director also shared plans for future developments. <br><h5>  Future plans: </h5><br><ul><li>  Receivers with feedback.  A full-fledged transceiver inside the control unit.  He will be able to send on request the status and brightness level set on it at the moment.  They promise to do it next year. </li><li>  A two-wire receiver (control unit), which turns on instead of a conventional switch - into a wire break.  In addition to this, it connects to the existing switch with two other wires, realizing an absolutely transparent circuit - the switch stays in place and performs its function as before, there is no need to climb into the chandelier and cut the wires.  And after installation you get the opportunity to control the light from other switches or from a router. </li><li>  Center of the smart home on the base of the tablet, which is mounted on the wall.  Custom software, which will include both the function of controlling the light in the apartment, and logging sensor readings, recording events, a complex system of reaction to events (if no one walks around the house in any of the rooms, turn off all the lights if they don‚Äôt walk for two days , randomly turn on the light at night), voice control and the functionality of showing news, weather, messages, and so on. </li></ul><br><br>  Another outcome of the exhibition was the partnership of Madrobots and Nootechnics - now their kits will be sold on our <a href="http://madrobots.ru/">website</a> in the <a href="http://madrobots.ru/about/">store on the top crust</a> . <br><br> <a href="https://twitter.com/MadrobotsRu"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ac1/fc6/d2a/ac1fc6d2a19948c59791b0da6ab659df.gif"></a> <a href="http://vk.com/madrobots"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/933/ac3/0b6/933ac30b6fd24ffd82218148c2fb0917.gif"></a> <a href="http://instagram.com/madrobotsru"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/464/a82/e04/464a82e045a34bae81406fd0b640cf08.gif"></a> <a href="http://facebook.com/madrobotsrussia"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0b5/542/136/0b55421365064901acdf0ed58cc4a111.gif"></a> <br> <a href="http://madrobots.ru/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/63d/405/78e/63d40578ecbf48f28c62f57705c73eb6.gif"></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/243369/">https://habr.com/ru/post/243369/</a></p>
