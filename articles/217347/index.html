  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to start taking utilities in comfort</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I never considered myself a disciplined person in matters related to the utilization of utilities: I took off the meter readings irregularly, paying my bills on receipts each time until later, which occurred after 3-4 months.  Because of this, you had to overpay, because  various pennies were charged, and it was difficult to recheck the management company, and whether they charge correctly.  Periodic attempts to begin to take into account the readings of the counters and payments on them with improvised means did not lead to anything: the sheets with the records of the readings were lost, the excel file forgot to fill out.  And then in November last year, our Criminal Code taught and sent me and other residents of our house receipts with incomprehensibly large amounts of payment for heating, simply ceasing to take into account the readings of heat meters, explaining that with large heat losses at home and completely non-transparent formulas of calculation, according to which they themselves "debit with the loan did not converge." <br><br>  Residents of our house, including myself, strongly resented this boorish attitude and, in a passionate rush to restore justice, began to unite in the HOA, I also thought about a convenient way of recording meter readings with all sorts of data analyzes, reports, reminders, and the exchange of useful information. information with your neighbors. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  At once I will say that the service, albeit in minimal functionality, is already available to anyone at: <a href="http://dom24x7.ru/">dom24x7.ru</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/796/3e1/ab9/7963e1ab9b113a076a7c729847a06900.png">

      To account for my personal finances, I often used various specialized programs and services, which on the Internet, even before a dime, for every taste and color, so my first thought was to find a suitable service for accounting for communal services.  How surprised I was when I didn‚Äôt find such a service (I don‚Äôt exclude the possibility that I was just looking bad), and various crafts for a mobile device were primitive and did not satisfy my requirements. <br><br>  Since I have not found such a service, I need to do it, I thought, and, rolling up my sleeves, I began to develop. <br><br>  On the nose were the New Year holidays and it was possible for anything without being distracted completely immersed in the development. <br><br>  Sketching a small plan for the help of women and functionality, proceeded to develop the service architecture and database structure, and at the same time ordered the design of the site.  After a bit of thinking, I decided to use the java language and the vaadin framework to develop the service.  Why him?  I know him well enough and I did not want to make a garden using different technologies and languages, and to write to the maximum on java.  Unfortunately, this solution also has its drawbacks, the main one of which, in my opinion, is poor interaction with search services.  But, basically, almost all of the functionality will be available only in a restricted area only after authorization, where there is no access to search engines, and also, both Yandex and Google have a mechanism for indexing sites that are completely made on ajax technology, and vaadin This mechanism fully supports (links to the description of the mechanism can be viewed at the end of the article). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7cc/d0d/ee5/7ccd0dee58a288cb18f48530ffeaae66.png"><br><br>  The choice of hosting turned out to be a little more complicated, since  few people offer hosting for java.  Here either rent a virtual server, or look towards the clouds.  I chose the second path and decided to take a closer look at the cloud hosting jelastic, which is actively developing lately.  We managed to deal with it literally (thanks to the guys who developed such a convenient product) and the environment was created and configured, and no problems were caused by <a href="http://dom24x7.ru/">setting</a> up the <a href="http://dom24x7.ru/">dom24x7.ru</a> domain to work with cloud hosting. <br><br>  At the moment, we managed to develop a small amount of the planned functionality: <br>  After registration, the service allows you to create as many addresses as you like and attach to each of them an unlimited number of meters of various types (water, electricity, heating and gas).  You can create multiple meters of the same type (for example, to account for hot and cold water).  For each meter, you can save readings, and view various reports and graphs. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/85f/ecf/f41/85fecff4169aacceb94be13cb561c74c.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/461/505/a1d/461505a1dd2e649519dc8f839c58d442.png"><br><br>  There are plans to introduce a social component that will allow residents of one house to exchange messages, take into account payments for sent payment orders, and in the future pay directly through the service, add various reminders and much more. <br><br>  That's all for now. <br><br>  PS: This is my first article from many in which I will try to fully cover the life and development of the service <a href="http://dom24x7.ru/">dom24x7.ru</a> , as well as the technologies that are used in its creation. <br><br>  Update on 03/29/2014: For now I‚Äôm dealing with addresses not found, and for the future, I allowed to edit the address directly <br><br>  <b>Promised links:</b> <br>  Link to service accounting utilities: <a href="http://dom24x7.ru/">dom24x7.ru</a> <br>  Official vaadin website: <a href="https://vaadin.com/">vaadin.com</a> <br>  Cloud platform jelastic: <a href="http://jelastic.com/">jelastic.com</a> <br>  Recommendations for improving the indexing of ajax sites by search servers: <br><ul><li>  on Google: <a href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/174992%3Fhl%3Dru">support.google.com/webmasters/answer/174992?hl=en</a> </li><li>  in Yandex: <a href="">help.yandex.ru/webmaster/robot-workings/ajax-indexing.xml</a> </li><li>  How to implement recommendations in the application on vaadin: <a href="https://vaadin.com/book/-/page/advanced.urifu.html">vaadin.com/book/-/page/advanced.urifu.html</a> (read carefully the chapter Supporting Web Crawling) </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/217347/">https://habr.com/ru/post/217347/</a></p>
