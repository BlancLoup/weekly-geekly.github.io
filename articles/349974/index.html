In today's selection of three interesting start-ups that can change the scope of health and finance. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h2>  Lightcash: Cryptocurrency Gold Provided </h2><br>  The creators of the project are trying to solve one of the main problems of cryptocurrencies - their high volatility.  Constant fluctuations in the course scare ordinary people who could use them as a means of payment, and make it difficult to implement such a method of payment for business.  To make LCSH's own currency stable, the Lightcash team tied it to real gold mined at Russian deposits.  The founders of the project also own a gold mining company operating a gold deposit and received licenses for its mining (there are data on the site and associated infrastructure on the site and in the project white paper).

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/1q/vr/rr/1qvrrr0zyplcxykfy5650xknh3k.png"><br><br>  The price of ten thousand LCSH coins equals one gram of gold.  The currency will not be mined, it will be issued as much as the company‚Äôs current gold reserves can be provided for.  To expand the issue, the project team plans to buy additional gold deposits - including an ICO project to be held in early March.  In addition to cryptocurrency itself, Lightcash is also a system for working with electronic and fiat money, including a wallet, stock exchange, SWIFT / SEPA money transfer service, the ability to open corporate accounts and cryptocurrency deposits with accrued interest (this feature will be available to ICO participants). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/co/nb/gy/conbgywqlkyjfcwo9zjlx70wk-w.png"><br><br><blockquote>  Pre-ICO project starts on March 5th. </blockquote><br><h2>  Celsius: crypto deposits and fiat loans secured by cryptocurrency </h2><br>  The idea of ‚Äã‚ÄãCelsius is to allow cryptocurrency owners to provide these assets to borrowers who need them for short sales on the exchange.  Many hedge funds and trading firms do not believe in the future of the cryptocurrency market.  In order to make a bet on the stock exchange on his fall, they need to make a short sale of cryptocurrency.  That is, somewhere to borrow it, sell it, wait for the price to fall, buy it back - pick up the difference in price, and return the cryptoactive asset to the owner. <br><br>  The system does not work on the p2p-model, when transactions are concluded between specific users.  Instead, the funds of owners of cryptoactive assets are collected in pools, they are borrowed by large funds, which require large-scale transactions for profit. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xi/be/3i/xibe3ibxqazekv0ilcapy5dn8nu.png"><br><br>  Celsius allows owners of cryptocurrency to lend it and earn a percentage on it - up to 7% per annum.  It turns out a kind of contribution to the cryptocurrency.  In addition, cryptoactives can be used as collateral for loans in dollars. <br><br><blockquote>  At the moment, there is a Pre-Sale project, a full-fledged ICO will begin on March 15th. </blockquote><br><h2>  Genetic Immunity: Vaccines for HIV and Other Diseases </h2><br>  Researchers from the American biotech company Genetic Immunity are developing and commercializing the so-called "immune vaccines."  These are therapeutic vaccines for the treatment of chronic diseases such as HIV, as well as cancer and various types of allergies.  The purpose of this type of treatment is usually to enhance the immunity of a person so that he becomes resistant to incurable diseases.  In the event that he is already ill, such therapy may reduce the negative impact on health. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/kf/19/fv/kf19fvouk1bf9-ze-pvdvap9hh8.png"><br><br>  At the moment, the main product of the company is the DermaVir vaccine.  According to the White paper project, the vaccine has passed a series of rounds of clinical trials that confirmed the fact that it can kill HIV-infected cells.  The project team plans to conduct an ICO not to finance drug development ‚Äî reportedly there is no problem ‚Äî but to collect funds for the costs of obtaining the necessary licenses and approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), as well as further market launch of the vaccine. <br><br><blockquote>  Pre-ICO project is scheduled for early May. </blockquote><br>  <i>And what interesting future ICO do you know?</i> <br><br><h3>  Previous collections on cryptocurrency, ICO and blockchain: </h3><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/339222/">Savings on the exchange, ownership history and arbitration: 5 useful services for Bitcoin users</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/marger1/posts/">4 ICO IT startups: selling excess communications, parallel Internet and awards to open-source developers</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/336644/">5 interesting ICO in September 2017: lead generation, online payments and search for restaurants</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/335738/">The most interesting ICO of summer 2017: national cryptocurrency, blockchain-social network and streaming service</a> </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/349974/">https://habr.com/ru/post/349974/</a></p>
