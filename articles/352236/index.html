  <section class="page js-page"><h1>16 DevOps conferences of 2018, performances from which are worth seeing</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In general, there are much more similar conferences, but these can be called flagship conferences.  They take place in different parts of the world and I, of course, do not encourage them to personally visit them.  What is the use?  Watching video, audio, or presentations can help you see technological innovations, the general motion vector of technologies and, perhaps, already begin to introduce something new in your organization.  I myself do in this sequence: I go to the conference site, watch the program, choose useful performances for myself, start to google them and then search on YouTube, Slideshare, Speakerdek or Soundkloud.  Not always lucky, but more often traces of performances can be found.  I even once addressed a question to one of the speakers through Linkedin. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ba/nk/mr/bankmrum7jafhxgt2bqrgm0saew.jpeg"><br><br>  In the post I will provide links to each conference, go to the site, see what was interesting in 2017, was or will be in 2018, google and study.  At each event, not only software manufacturers, but also large companies that use it.  No problem, you can find a business case similar to yours. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  1. <a href="https://www.devopsdays.org/">DevOps Days</a> </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/dh/mg/o7/dhmgo7tba-_ycpdmrmu6tolihfk.png">

      This is not one conference, but a whole series, which is held on different dates around the world.  All this is carried out not by one organization, therefore the formats may differ.
