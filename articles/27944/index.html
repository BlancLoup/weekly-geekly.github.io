According to the <a href="http://dirti.ru/%3Fp%3D31">source</a> , the site collects reviews of companies and real wages of employees of these companies.  All this data is anonymous and available to absolutely all registered users.  (The creators of the project plan to earn money by providing the collected information to job seekers, premium services, that is, simply selling the collected and ordered information to potential workers). <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/22d/31d/7f5/22d31d7f5382732886027bd1466f939a.png" width="450" height="275" hspace="10" vspace="10"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The idea is to collect the most detailed salary data and requirements for each position in the company so that applicants can know how to respond to a particular offer, and already established employees will be able to compare their salaries with the salaries of their colleagues.  ‚ÄúWhen the annual report arrives,‚Äù says executive director Robert Hohman, ‚Äúyou must know how much you are worth.‚Äù

      So <a href="http://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/Google-Salaries-E9079.htm">how much does a software developer earn at Google?</a>  On average (data obtained from ten employees) $ 97,840.  In fact, salaries range from $ 80,000 to $ 150,000 per year.  In addition, workers receive bonuses, the size of which for the year ranges from $ 20,000 to $ 45,000.  If you add up the salary and bonuses, then according to Glassdoor, a Google programmer on average a year brings his wife $ 112,573 (besides this you need to take into account the stock option).  <a href="http://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/Yahoo-Salaries-E5807.htm">Yahoo</a> and Microsoft engineers get almost as much, but their premiums are smaller, so their annual income is $ 105,642 and $ 105,375, respectively.  Software developers at Apple earn an average of $ 89,000 a year, and at the same time, they create the most favorite user products.  (see chart at the beginning of the article) <br><br>  Anyone can see the data about these companies (Google, Yahoo, Microsoft and Apple), but do not forget about the ‚Äúyou for me - I for you‚Äù model.  You will need to leave a review before you see other users.  The same with salaries.  (The company will do its best to identify and remove false data).  Each company and its director has a rating.  Here are the ratings of Jerry Yang and Steve Ballmer.  Ratings are compiled using reviews that employees leave about their directors.  Yang - 59%, and Ballmer - 69%. <br><br> <a href="http://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/Yahoo-Salaries-E5807.htm"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/67d/4ab/242/67d4ab2426c4f62a3c040a8bcfe25493.png" width="450" height="280" hspace="10" vspace="10"></a> <br><br>  Google Executive Director Eric Schmitt (Erick Schmidt) secured a rating of 89%.  While Google rating (as a company in which I would like to work) is 4.2 on a five-point scale.  Microsoft has the same indicator, but Yahoo has only 3.8, which is not surprising.  Of course, all these data can not fully reflect the current state of affairs.  For example, when compiling the Microsoft rating, data provided by 124 respondents were used, Yahoo - 50, Google - 37. The more respondents, the more accurate the results. <br><br>  In addition to the rating and information on wages, reviews are available that most fully reflect the picture.  Even in Google, not everything is as beautiful as it seems at first glance.  ‚ÄúFree cheese in a mousetrap,‚Äù says Hochman.  One of the reviews is called ‚ÄúAwesome culture, no management‚Äù.  Another ‚ÄúFun at first, then not so much‚Äù.  And the most interesting ‚ÄúGoogle: a platform for the elite‚Äù.  Here is a snippet: <br><br>  <em>If you prefer an individual style, then Google is not for you (do not forget that I am not an engineer).</em>  <em>Google‚Äôs atmosphere is too ‚Äúgoogled‚Äù, something like Brady Bunch if they lived in Russia in the days of communism.</em>  <em>Googling relationships, artificial smiles, as well as a complete lack of complaints about sinless superiors are encouraged: If you like forced group collaboration, then Google is a paradise for you.</em>  <em>It is unlikely that the word ‚Äúforced‚Äù fits, no one forces anyone to do anything, but if suddenly you are not like everyone else, then a label with the inscription ‚Äúnot a googlovets‚Äù will hang on you.</em>  <em>And if this happens, then you instantly become a black sheep that constantly tries to disgrace the whole herd.</em> <em><br><br></em>  <em>Top Management Advice:</em> <em><br><br></em>  <em>‚ÄúEnough to build King Midas: just being rich on AdWords does not mean that absolutely all your products are the height of technical excellence.</em>  <em>I do not remember a single decision that I could truly call a breakthrough.</em>  <em>And I am talking about a company that positions itself as the developer of all the newest.</em>  <em>You talk about innovation, hiding behind mergers with various companies and acquiring companies of various kinds (just because Google became the owner of YouTube, it cannot be called innovative). ‚Äù</em> <em><br></em> <br><br>  Someone is visibly embittered, but this does not mean that this someone is telling a lie (by the way, one cannot say that this person is an employee of Google).  Most of the reviews on Google are positive.  And if you read everything, you can catch the main idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe majority.  Who knows if it will be a determining factor when choosing a place to work that Google cares about its employees.  Will Netflix's privacy policy push you away?  (Everyone decides for himself what is best). <br><br>  If Glassdoor can get people talking about the salary and the internal climate of the company in which they work, the transparent Internet will destroy another fortress. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/c76/b60/ba7/c76b60ba7193f0919a97b32b31d16f5e.png" width="450" height="330" hspace="10" vspace="10"></a> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/d53/25a/b61/d5325ab61fc3b8df9a939a8be02319ee.png" width="450" height="405" hspace="10" vspace="10"></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/27944/">https://habr.com/ru/post/27944/</a></p>
