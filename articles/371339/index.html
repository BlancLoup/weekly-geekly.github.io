In addition, he discussed with other participants the problem of the possible destruction of humanity.  The most likely reasons for this are an increase in the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, a third world war, and the creation of a strong form of AI. <br><br>  Earlier, Musk said that he believes that without a colony on another planet in the solar system, a person is doomed.  Now he has confirmed this opinion, stating that on Earth humankind has a dark future - a war or something else, as mentioned above.  ‚ÄúMost likely, we are awaited by the‚Äú new dark ages ‚Äù, especially if a third world war happens,‚Äù Musk commented on the need to colonize Mars. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  He stressed that the colony will allow its inhabitants to be outside the zone of influence of terrestrial factors that could lead to the death of human civilization.  The colony, according to Mask, is a ‚Äúbackup of humanity‚Äù, in case it‚Äôs mostly a ‚Äúrepository‚Äù, that is, humanity on Earth for one reason or another disappears.

This and Tesla Inc., and SpaceX, and more.  The entrepreneur hopes that methods to save humanity need to be developed before the onset of a major threat.  For some reason, he is very afraid of the capabilities of artificial intelligence and what artificial intelligence (if we create, of course) can do.  ‚ÄúAI is more dangerous than nuclear warheads.  So why the relevant services almost do not pay attention to this sphere, ‚ÄùIlon Musk asks. <br><br>  By the way, he made his first statement regarding the danger of AI in 2014.  Musk, however, reminded those present that instead of the AI ‚Äã‚Äãdestroyer of mankind, other threats could be realized, for example, the same nuclear war.  In this case, the colony to Mars can be sent as quickly as possible, otherwise the threat to humanity is becoming more and more serious. <br><br>  Musk also repeated his words regarding artificial intelligence: ‚ÄúThe biggest problem I see is that so-called AI experts believe they can cope with artificial intelligence.  But they don‚Äôt even know how smart an AI can be.  And this is misleading people, few people believe in a catastrophe at all because of AI ‚Äù. <br><br>  True, the gloomy pictures painted by Mask should not be trusted too much.  He is known for his penchant for ‚Äúwe all die‚Äù, providing all of this with philosophical concepts, ethics and other things.  He believes that a strong form of AI is about to be invented.  ‚ÄúAnd it terrifies me to horror,‚Äù says Musk.  In order not only to be afraid, but also to do something, the entrepreneur <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/27/15077864/elon-musk-neuralink-brain-computer-interface-ai-cyborgs">founded the</a> new company Neuralink.  According to him, the company's specialists will be able to give a threat to repel if it appears.  ‚ÄúNeuralink will try to help by creating a wide channel of fast communication between AI and the human brain,‚Äù Musk said. <br><br>  In addition to deadly hazards, Musk also talked about autonomous cars.  According to him, they are 200% safer than the safest cars in the world, driven by people. <br><br>  But perhaps the most interesting promise of Mask is the promise to launch BFR this fall.  Maybe it's just PR, but most likely, Ilon Musk will still follow his plan. <br><br><div class="oembed"><twitter-widget class="twitter-tweet twitter-tweet-rendered" id="twitter-widget-1" style="position: static; visibility: visible; display: block; transform: rotate(0deg); width: 500px; margin: 10px auto; max-width: 100%; min-width: 220px;" data-tweet-id="972907732658479105"></twitter-widget><script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><br>  The main project to which Ilon Mask devotes a lot of time is the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259C%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B6%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D1%2581%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D1%2582%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0_(SpaceX)">Interplanetary Transport System</a> (ITS) and the colonization of Mars. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0qo78R_yYFA" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  ITS should work as follows: a rocket takes a spacecraft in orbit and returns to Earth.  Already there, in space, the ship is refueled, it opens up the solar panels and goes to Mars.  Thanks to this, Musk hopes to make the system reliable and not insanely expensive.  In all this, the BFR (Big Falcon Rocket) plays a very important role.  As for the colonization of Mars, then initially there will be launched satellites that will help to thoroughly study the surface of the planet, so that it was clear where to land the colonists.  And then space ships and, possibly, people will follow. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/371339/">https://habr.com/ru/post/371339/</a></p>
