  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Use of city telephone numbering in IP-telephony</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Habravchane, hello! <br><br>  Not so long ago, there was an entertaining <a href="http://www.vedomosti.ru/tech/news/2306155/mobilnaya_zamena_skype">news</a> that the GSM International Association proposed to move the ‚Äúbig three‚Äù and Tele2 to a single IP platform.  Switching to IP-telephony should allow operators to the already available basic services to enable the exchange of files, video calls, conferences, chat and other services.  At the same time, such services have long been successfully provided by various Internet services, earning on "clean" IP-telephony.  And while IP-services have limitations, IP-telephony is already becoming a full-fledged product for communication, competing with cellular communication. <br><br>  MTT launched YouMagic IP telephony service, which conveniently combines the main advantages of using data transmission via the Internet protocol, traditional telephony and can use the mobile network as an infrastructure for its work.  In addition to the usual conveniences of IP-telephony, YouMagic can receive a city number from Russia or even from another country for free and quickly.  In a traditional connection, getting a direct city number is quite a complicated and time-consuming process, which usually takes a lot of money, time and nerves.  In YouMagic, this is done quickly and without visits to the operator‚Äôs office.  How this opportunity is realized I would like to tell you.

To connect the city numbering to the IP telephony of a telecommunications company, a lot of work is required, which is associated with serious costs and bureaucratic red tape.  This is not available for every company, and therefore often in IP-telephony services landline numbers are rented from different operators.  This does not ensure proper reliability of the service and does not guarantee the possibility of its expansion, therefore MTT prefers to do all such work on its own.  Getting the city numbering is not complete without very important steps: <br><br>  1) It is necessary to obtain a license from the state for the provision of local telephone services; <br><br>  2) It is important to purchase certified equipment for a local communication hub: A large carrier-class PBX, including several servers and a switch; <br><br>  3) It is obligatory to rent a technical site, install and configure equipment, with electricity and communication channels with redundancy; <br><br>  4) It would be good to request and purchase local numbering from a state for a specific pool; <br><br>  5) There is no way to do without the acceptance procedure and performance check by Roskomnadzor and other departments of the communication center; <br><br>  6) It should be requested to open access to the selected numbering from other local telephone operators; <br><br>  7) Now you can safely sell numbers! <br><br>  The scheme for obtaining urban numbering abroad is much simpler.  This is due to a simplified system of foreign legislation.  It is enough to find a partner operator who agrees to redirect the numbering to the company's servers and make sure that your equipment works with the partner‚Äôs capacity. <br><br>  Expanding the geography of city numbering from YouMagic in large localities like Moscow, St. Petersburg, Yekaterinburg, Rostov-on-Don, Samara is not the last argument in the growth of popularity of the service.  Already, in YouMagic, you can get city numbering in 8 million-plus cities across Russia and 6 countries of the world.  Until the end of the year, MTT plans to connect YouMagic to the numbering of all major cities of Russia, as well as expand the numbering capacity connection in other countries. <br><br>  Today, the market for long-distance and international calls is characterized by changes associated with the growth of IP traffic.  MTT, as one of the largest transit operators, is actively developing new services and is creating a new open communication environment for YouMagic IP telephony service for all users, regardless of where they are located. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/150087/">https://habr.com/ru/post/150087/</a></p>
