There is a small electronic device, with an even smaller screen.  On the screen there is a wolf from the famous cartoon ‚ÄúWell, wait!‚Äù This wolf can be controlled with the help of four buttons.  The goal of the game is to catch eggs that carry chickens.  Well, what is there to tell, for sure you yourself know everything.  But did you know that in addition to ‚ÄúWell, wait a minute!‚Äù Other games of this series were also released?  And the fact that these games are not original development, but a copy of the Nintendo Game-n-Watch?  Probably not everyone knows this.  It turns out that not only our children dreamed of such games and hung out with them all day.  I will tell you about one such game.  This is the "Secrets of the Ocean", and nee Octopus.  It will be a small story about how old electronic games from childhood sometimes come back. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/2a729b24/61f4793d/9f83a7be/a703faec.jpg" title="Electronics IM-03. Secrets of the ocean" alt=" -03.  "><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  First appearance </h4><br>  At one time, like any other Soviet child of my age, I dreamed of playing ‚ÄúWell, wait a minute!‚Äù However, fate would have pleased me with another game from this series.  Yes, it is already clear that I am talking about the game "Secrets of the Ocean."  At first I, of course, was upset.  But then I realized that it was even better.  All on the screen, the wolf catches eggs, but my brave divers get treasures from the bottom of the sea, and even dodge the terrible monster - the octopus.  Yes, and you can change with others for a while and play ‚ÄúWell, wait a minute!‚Äù For your pleasure.  So, I was pleased until I grew out of the age of such games and switched to other games, and not only games.

    <h4>  Second appearance </h4><br>  It so happened that I managed to save my beloved <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25AD%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0_%25D0%2598%25D0%259C-03">IM-03 Electronics</a> .  Although I had to worry, because  once I dropped it and broke the screen.  I had to give in for repair.  I was even afraid that the game would not return from repair, because  the country was already beginning to slowly fever and anything could be.  There was no time for games.  But my fears were in vain.  The game is back alive and healthy.  Only the screen has changed.  Everything was drawn differently.  Much later, I found out that two modifications of the game were being released, and at first I had the first one, and after repairing, put the screen from the second one. <br><br>  Something I digress.  Anyway, the game I have survived to this day.  And one day my son found her.  That was the joy.  And as he just did not break it ... <br><br><h4>  Rebirth </h4><br>  It so happened that my professional activity is related to <a href="http://www.kpda.ru/QNX6/QNX6">QNX</a> (on Habr√© there were <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/nix/124656/">several notes</a> about this RTOS).  I am engaged in the development of this RTOS, even developed some parts of the system itself.  One of the activities of our company is the development of a <a href="http://www.kpda.ru/BSP/PlayBook">BlackBerry PlayBook</a> .  Probably, many already know that the PlayBook uses the Tablet OS, which is based on QNX.  We have to keep abreast of new trends. <br><br>  How to understand the filling of the PlayBook?  How to understand what he is capable of, what can we expect from him?  Of course, it is necessary to develop under it.  There were a lot of ideas, most of them went into implementation.  And one of the ideas was to reproduce the "Secrets of the Ocean" on the PlayBook.  By the way, my son found this game. <br><br>  Over the game had to work hard.  We do not develop games.  Our profile is the <a href="http://www.kpda.ru/KPDA6/KPDA6">CRPA AGRO</a> , system development for QNX and CPDA, implementation of protocols, development of software platforms.  Recently we are working with multimedia.  This is a modern market demand.  Now devices should not be dull.  And although we do not develop games, we are accustomed to doing our job very well.  And we took the testing very seriously.  It was decided to reproduce the game as fully as possible on the PlayBook. <br><br>  In my opinion, we coped with the task.  The game turned out.  Implemented both versions of the game (A and B), clock, alarm clock.  The gameplay is completely identical, the same sounds, even the buttons are pressed.  Wow!  There are, of course, differences.  For example, the PlayBook screen is somewhat larger than the original game "Secrets of the Ocean", so I had to stretch it a little.  On the other hand, this is probably a plus.  After all, you can see every little thing. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/a8ad06f8/407bcf52/63dbe46b/d2add197.jpg" title="&quot;Secrets of the Ocean&quot; on the BlackBerry PlayBook" alt="¬´ ¬ª  BlackBerry PlayBook"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/6d4ccd01/5a8774be/84d8174d/deabdcdf.jpg" title="&quot;Secrets of the ocean.&quot; Development is coming to an end." alt="¬´ ¬ª.    ."><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f1a/2f6/65d/f1a2f665dfa7be2a7b2e5d3406e9d522.png" title="QR code &quot;Secrets of the Ocean&quot;" alt="QR- ¬´ ¬ª" align="left">  "Secrets of the Ocean" is available in <a href="http://appworld.blackberry.com/webstore/content/62979%3Flang%3Den">AppWorld</a> called Octopus for free.  And what is remarkable, after the publication of the game, in a little over a day, more than ten positive feedback was received.  It's nice to say.  We will also be happy if you give your opinion here, in AppWorld or <a href="http://forum.kpda.ru/index.php/topic,645.0.html">on our forum</a> .  The forum can also tell about errors found, make comments and suggestions. <br><br>  And, probably, the most interesting.  We have already received several requests to implement ‚ÄúWell, wait a minute!‚Äù And we decided to meet the users, to release this wonderful game.  But, unfortunately, we do not have a ‚Äúlive‚Äù game, which is needed to reproduce all the little things.  If someone can help and provide a working <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259D%25D1%2583,_%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B8!_%2528%25D1%258D%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B3%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%2529">IM-02 Electronics</a> , please contact me. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/131419/">https://habr.com/ru/post/131419/</a></p>
