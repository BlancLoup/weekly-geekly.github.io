Because this is probably the only place where it is enough just to write a good article and that's it!  Then everything happens by itself.  But it was so. <br><br>  Some time ago an inner voice wrote: <br>  <b>Now you can vote for karma only with a karma not lower than +15, for topics - not lower than +10.</b> <br><br>  And something has changed.  What exactly?  Look at the numbers:

After the introduction of new thresholds, the voting mass decreased, according to my assumption, by the same 3-5 times.  What does it mean?  And that's what. </li><li>  It is not enough to write a good post, you just need to write a great post to get to the main page, according to the current / all. </li><li>  Now there is enough organized action by a group of 10‚Äì20 people to take any worst post to the first page.  Or vice versa, it is also easy to drown the best post minus. </li><li>  As a karma expert, I‚Äôll say that it is almost impossible for newcomers to overcome karma 15 without tricks.  So we fix the existing structure of the authors. </li><li>  As an author, each topic of which hit the main page, I‚Äôll say that the price of votes has grown 3-5 times, which means that it has become 3 times harder to get into old-timers and get PAP.  But it will also be harder for existing authors to get papa's encouragement 3 times. </li><li>  Beginners will no longer be able to get into the pantheons, at least until the population of Habr has grown to the next 3 times. </li></ul><br>  I am absolutely not against balancing the qualification, the issue has accumulated for a long time.  But the shock change broke the balance and changed the incentives. <br><br>  What to do?  Well, for starters, change the thresholds of voting for and against topics.  They should not be the same.  The threshold "for" must be twice lower than the threshold "against."  Perhaps these thresholds as it is worth linking to the number of registered accounts for indexing voice inflation.  It is important that these changes be smoother. <br><br>  In the meantime, getting used to the shock changes, the number of articles and comments will fall.  In a word, instead of a cake, temporarily have to get by with charlotte.  Human nature tends to change.  When everything is too good, people for some reason get into trouble for themselves.  But achieving an ideal turns life into lifeless.  In the end, the worm in the apple proves that it is alive, do not need to kill him! <br><br>  <b>Update</b> <br>  Least of all, I would like the topic to become a regular jerkiness - merciless plucking, ridiculous offers and the loss of fighters from a hangover in the morning. <br><br>  In fact, I wanted to single out one most important point.  Previously, voting <b>for the</b> topic required +2 karma, and for voting <b>against</b> +4, so we had a statistically positive average amount.  Now, if I correctly understood the UFO, the threshold is the same and equals 10, and a zero sum is obtained.  If we recall that raising the threshold has reduced the number of voters by about 3 times, then the balance has changed dramatically. <br><br>  To put it simply, when writing an article, you need to think not about being interesting to someone, but about not offending anyone.  The fear factor, you know, motivates creativity very badly. <br><br>  I assume that this is just a random error, which can be corrected by setting thresholds of 5 for pluses and 10 for minuses in the rating.  The rest is already the lyrics and jerking, which is pursued by the laws of UFO! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/135540/">https://habr.com/ru/post/135540/</a></p>
