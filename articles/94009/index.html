      I have to say that this site did not <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/internet/93002/">save</a> me time, but rather added. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Stage 1. Registration.</b> <br>  She did not pass the first time - the site stubbornly did not want to accept my TIN.  In general, I am quite resigned - I tried it later.  Even large companies sometimes produce raw product. <br>  Received an authorization code in the mail after 2 weeks and left it in the car for a long time.  There was no time to complete the registration.  But it was not there!  State services began to actively spam me on the mail (2 posts in a row), and even sent me 2 sms (also in a row).  Registered successfully.  <b>Stage 2. Application.</b> <br><br>  Long and hard this site did not want to perceive me as a Muscovite.  All the time I assumed that I was from Chechnya.  After 5-10 minutes, I somehow chose Moscow and it did not change anymore. <br><br>  <b>Stage 3. Filling out an application.</b> <br><br>  Enough user-friendly interface, everything is quite intuitive, etc.  However, after I filled out ¬æ the site requested a photo from me (which, by the way, I didn‚Äôt have at hand).  I took a picture the next day and decided to continue.  I must say that you need a little photoshopit to site took a photo. <br>  <b>Stage 4. Voila!</b> <br><img src="http://i069.radikal.ru/1005/70/12d2dbe902dc.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Stage 5. Visit to OUFMS</b> <br><br>  I still had to fill in the form on paper, because  Our institute certifies only these forms and does not give references.  In one field I did not fit the place of work (the school changed the name already 3 times).  Call to OUFMS all decided: <br><br>  - Good afternoon, this is my question (describing), can I fill it in small letters? <br>  - Well, write in small print, as long as it is legible. <br>  - I'm on the computer fill <br>  - Well, make the font smaller (maybe some readers never filled out the form, for them I will explain that it is filled in pdf and the font cannot be changed there). <br>  It's funny ... <br>  From a certain source, I learned that my OUFMS did not issue a new type of license (I filled it on the Internet for a 10-year passport, others did not interest me). <br>  The second call to OUFMS again decided everything: <br><br>  - Good afternoon, are you issuing a new generation abroad? <br>  - Not. <br>  - I filled out the state service website, it was written there to appear to Mr. X and submit the documents. <br>  - Well, if such an invitation has come to you, come necessarily! <br>  - You do not make a passport of the new sample? <br>  - Well, you do not know the whole kitchen - come, once such an invitation has come. <br>  The arrival in my OUFMS success was not crowned.  I was met there by Mr. X, who invited me.  He apologized and said that ‚Äúthey simply do not know that we don‚Äôt do such things, go to another OUFMS, and we cannot accept the application, because it‚Äôs for a new passport‚Äù. <br>  A small result. <br>  That's how I was left with nothing.  I cannot resubmit the application to another OUFMS, for <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2ff/b04/bf4/2ffb04bf4dff1c951c7d7cff1c0466b7.jpg" alt="image"><br>  I also can not reject it, because it does not. <br>  I don‚Äôt want to talk about what it is like OUFMS, which does not issue passports of the new generation. <br>  Just before you apply, be sure to check. <br>  Findings: <br>  From the very beginning I had the impression that this site was made ‚Äúon from **.‚Äù  The president gave the order - we did.  In fact - this is true.  I want to devote the following post to services which can be used through this site. <br><br>  It is interesting to know your reviews, you got acquainted with this site, what did you do?  Or just get your opinion. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/94009/">https://habr.com/ru/post/94009/</a></p>
