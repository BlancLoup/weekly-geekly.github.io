  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Yandex.Market - to be or not?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  We decided to make an online store with our friends (before that, they only traded offline), to trade professional audio equipment.  Comrades - representatives of one Chinese brand (Biema), and one domestic (Digilab).  Both companies are more or less known among professional sound engineers.  Comrades trade, of course, not only these brands, for the range there are goods and more famous manufacturers, but of course, there are fewer of them. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In general, we made a store, launched it, some orders appeared, but not many.  I will give the address in the comments - hosting will not vydezhit if the load increases greatly.  We decided to accommodate, for a start, in Yandex.Market.  This required a module for our CMS (there was no ready one).  Paid the money made.  It also took a module to quickly update the price list - also ordered, done.  Have applied.  The answer comes (in a free retelling): ‚Äú <em>Refused, because you are a duplicate shop window, you have found serious inconsistencies with the rules, the product line coincides with the following stores: portime.ru, videomix.ru, bestblade.ru, otvet.su, kupiprinter.ru, cost4u.ru, nozh-v-podarok.ru, pixeltrade.ru, muzbazar.com, lizamarket.ru, pcmir.ru, pokupkamania.ru, medpredmet.ru.</em>  <em>You can apply for a review</em> . ‚Äù  It is useful to watch with whom we "coincide".  One address specified in the letter was not registered at all (!!!) according to nic.ru as of the date of the letter (and even now - lizamarket.ru).  Those.  there is simply no such domain.  The rest of the list is a store of printers and accessories, several medical equipment shops, several shops of knives, cameras, and so on.  True, most of them, except for the profiling positions, sell: who are household synthesizers, who are karaoke microphones, who are car amplifiers.  At the same time, no one is selling professional equipment. <br><br>  Ok, I am writing an application for revision, although, of course, I understand the ‚Äúoddity‚Äù of the situation: to explain to a serious, large, intelligent system that the store selling sound equipment and the store selling knives have nothing to do with each other: <br><br><blockquote>  Hello.

      We (YYY LLC) filed an application for the placement of goods from the YYY online store in the Yandex.Market system.  Previously, a module was developed to provide the generation of a YML file, for many products unique descriptions were written.  On May 11, a waiver was received, with the following wording: <br><br>  As a result of the check, serious inconsistencies in the information materials you place with the rules for placing information in Yandex.Market were detected. <br><br>  Details of one of the discrepancies found: Your store duplicates the store (s) portime.ru, videomix.ru, bestblade.ru, otvet.su, kupiprinter.ru, cost4u.ru, nozh-v-podarok.ru, pixeltrade.ru, muzbazar .com, lizamarket.ru, pcmir.ru, pokupkamania.ru, medpredmet.ru <br><br>  Date of shutdown: 05/10/10 <br><br>  Connecting the store to the Yandex.Market system is not possible. <br><br>  YYY Ltd. specializes in the sale of professional audio equipment.  The company employs highly skilled specialists in working with sound.  The company is well known among professional sound engineers.  YYY Ltd. cooperates directly with many manufacturers of equipment, as well as being the official representative of a number of trademarks in Russia. <br><br>  Regarding the comments on the duplication of the content of these stores I would like to note the following: <br><br>  Shop portime.ru sells watches and appliances.  Coincidence 1 out of almost 150 categories and no coincidence on product lines with the store YYY. <br><br>  The store videomix.ru presents a large selection of commodity items.  Among the products offered there are musical instruments.  There are several proposals for sound equipment.  In turn, YYY offers its customers exactly the equipment, in our range there are practically no musical instruments (their number is not comparable with the number of proposals for equipment). <br><br>  The bestblade.ru and nozh-v-podarok.ru stores offer their customers knives, lanterns and souvenirs.  In our assortment, none of this. <br><br>  otvet.su trades home appliances.  Intersection in the category "Musical Instruments", without intersection by heading.  otvet.su does not offer professional audio equipment. <br><br>  With stores cost4u.ru, kupiprinter.ru, pixeltrade.ru there is no commodity intersection. <br><br>  Shop muzbazar.com sells car acoustics.  There is no intersection. <br><br>  According to nic.ru, the address lizamarket.ru does not exist. <br><br>  Shop pcmir.ru offers home appliances.  No intersections. <br><br>  Shop pokupkamania.ru sells automotive acoustics and office equipment.  No intersections. <br><br>  The medical equipment shop medpredmet.ru also has no intersections with our range. <br><br>  According to nic.ru, all the specified domains do not have a match in the registration and contact data with the data of YYY LLC and the YYY online store. <br><br>  Based on the above, we ask you to reconsider the decision to connect the online store YYY to the Yandex.Market system. <br><br>  Respectfully, <br><br>  CEO YYY </blockquote><br><br>  Some time passed, it turned out that the fax did not pass, sent again, already in electronic form.  After 2 days, the answer comes, striking in its brevity, I quote: "The <em>answer from the Quality Control Service: the store is recognized as duplicating is true, inclusion is impossible</em> ."  It's nice that the answer was written by a real person (judging by a typo).  But the pleasures end there.  At the same time, a search in Yandex.Market for the word Biema yields 1 result, for the word Digilab - 0 results (there are more products of this brand in our assortment than any other, and this can be seen in the YML file). <br><br>  I ask for help and advice: where to be and what to do?  It is clear that Yandex is big and strong, and has the right to set its own rules.  On the other hand, such an answer is akin to sentencing.  In other systems, we will also be served, but it is not clear what to do in this case ... <br><br>  <strong>UPDATE:</strong> <br>  As promised, I am writing on the results of this topic. <br><br>  Thank God, the process has moved from a dead point, and at the moment our products are already represented in the Market.  I can advise those who will face a similar situation only the same way - to write here.  Habra - thanks! <br><br>  Yandex employees also thank you for responding, but it is not very clear how to resolve such a situation in a regular, ‚Äúpeaceful‚Äù way, without involving Habr.  After all, without diminishing the popularity of this resource, we all understand that there are people who cannot write here (I would venture to suggest that among quite decent stores there are those who have not heard about Habr at all).  Anyway, this is not a support forum for Yandex.  And communication by e-mail did not leave any hope. <br><br>  One more thing that surprised me was the opportunity to operate with the notorious ‚Äúexternal factors‚Äù to influence Yandex‚Äôs decisions about not accepting one store or another into the system.  I will show on our example.  As it turned out in correspondence with the head of Yandex.Market, the problem was that once (not a week or a month ago, anymore), one of the pages of one of the sites listed in the letter had a phone that was lit up, And now appears in our store.  They once tried to cooperate with us, published our phone on their website for inquiries, the collaboration did not go, after some time the phone was removed.  If it were not for this topic on Habr√©, we never would have known why we were not allowed into the Market.  In any case, we spent all this on a decent amount of time. <br><br>  From the pros - a few messages came from similar systems-aggregators.  Register, participate. <br><br>  Well, and an interesting fact - after this topic here, in the Market, the goods of one of the announced producers quickly appeared. <br><br>  Thank you all for your complicity and advice! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/99755/">https://habr.com/ru/post/99755/</a></p>
