At one of the open meetings of Google employees with co-founders of the company Sergey Brin and Larry Page or Sundar Pichai, one of them asked managers an unusual question about why many Nest employees were offered to work without days off for months. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Nest co-founder Matt Rogers said that this is "normal practice when launching new devices."  But such a response insulted many employees.

    <blockquote>  ‚ÄúHe did not admit that this is a bad practice and did not take responsibility for it.  Ultimately, when you ask employees to work on weekends, it‚Äôs the management‚Äôs fault, not theirs, ‚Äù <a href="http://uk.businessinsider.com/whats-going-on-at-nest-2016-2">said</a> one of Google‚Äôs former employees of Business Insider. </blockquote><br><br>  Three former employees of Nest likewise ridiculed the internal corporate culture of a startup because of the ever-breaking deadlines.  And this, in turn, was due to unrealistic deadlines for the delivery of the project.  As it became known thanks to other Nest employees, who were talked to by journalists from Business Insider, the startup has great potential for a revolution in the smart home market, but it suffers from constant employee layoffs and disorganization. <br><br>  The latter is also influenced by direct management.  Most employees characterize Tony Fadell as second Steve Jobs.  Because of the cruel treatment of employees, inside Nest there is an atmosphere of constant fear, and a lot of approvals only delay the release of a new product.  On Tony Fadella's Glassdoor site, the rating is a little over 60%, which only confirms this information.  Such an atmosphere does not contribute to the retention of employees who too often leave Nest. <br><br>  Despite the small number of manufactured products - a smart thermostat, a smart smoke detector and a camera, which we started selling after <a href="http://recode.net/2014/06/20/googles-nest-buys-dropcam-for-555-million/">absorbing</a> Dropcam for $ 555 million in 2014, each of them has serious problems.  For example, thermostat users complain of unexpected temperature changes in the morning or in another period of time. <br><br>  And recently, users of the Nest camera encountered an unexpected shutdown of the service, which is unacceptable if the service is used for tracking children.  And this is only one of the three "falls" of the service for working with the camera for the year. <br><br>  All this led to extremely low profits in the Alphabet report.  According to official information, Nest, Google Fiber and the Verily unit made a total profit of $ 448 million, while analysts expected Nest to overcome this mark alone. <br><br>  In any case, Nest has great potential, which is only to be realized in the near future.  But the Google division will have to grow much faster due to the entry of competitors such as Apple's HomeKit to the market. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/298714/">https://habr.com/ru/post/298714/</a></p>
