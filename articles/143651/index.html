  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Universal assessment system (goals, methods, actions, etc.)</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  We all use different systems for monitoring ourselves and organizing our actions.  Someone needs a notebook, and someone has created a whole cloud infrastructure for himself.  We can memorize everything or store data on the Internet: the data still remains data.  But how to evaluate their effectiveness, benefit or, say, ‚Äúkindness‚Äù of actions, goals and other things?  If anyone interested - please under the cat. <br><a name="habracut"></a>  I'll start over.  This concept was developed in a period of reflection on the benefits / harms of religions and the morality or immorality of certain actions.  The concept was derived on the basis of personal experience and does not pretend to Universal Truth (although almost all my friends accepted this concept favorably). <br><br>  Point one.  Basics of Geometry. <br>  Although I am sure that geometry is remembered by everyone, without it in my concept, nowhere. <br><br>  The measurement is zero.  Point.  I am. I am me and nothing more.  At the moment - that's all.

      Measurement first.  Line.  I and the coordinate system is good-bad.  Evaluating yourself and your actions on a ten-point scale, where 5 is good, -5 is bad.  Introduced framework of morality.  Each defines for itself the limits of the permissible.  This is done as follows: five or more crimes are taken, then five or more good deeds.  Each of these cases is assigned a score on the same ten-point scale.  Then the invalid is truncated.  For example, inadvertent murder is rated on a scale of -4.  Allowed personal scope - -1,5.  If someone can not immediately call for a framework of permissible - can use the Gauss ratio (0.8-0.2).  Important: <b>Do not forget to raise your moral framework as you develop.</b> <br><br>  The measurement is second.  Plane.  I and the coordinate system "good-bad" + "effectively inefficient."  The evaluation methods are the same.  Only now the plane on the border of the framework is admissible (according to Gauss - 0.64 from the common plane). <br><br>  Measurement third.  Volume.  I and the coordinate system of ‚Äúgood-bad‚Äù + ‚Äúeffectively inefficient‚Äù + ‚Äúfor myself-for all.‚Äù  The methods are the same. <br><br>  Subspace 0. Dreams and goals.  Evaluated by the system "good-bad" + "for yourself, for all."  By goal is meant only a task of type SMART.  Dreams are more abstract desires and can often be not any points or segments (segments will occur in exceptional cases), but vectors.  <b>It is highly recommended to use Hypercell (it is the ‚ÄúPurpose of the whole life‚Äù).</b> <br><br>  Subspace 1. Objectives and methods.  The set is the perpendicularity of the planes of the target (see subspace 0) and methods (‚Äúgood-bad‚Äù + ‚Äúefficiently inefficient‚Äù). <br><br>  Subspace 2. Public opinion.  A person is a social being ... The system is the same as in subspace 0, but the <b>opinion of the</b> circles of <b>society</b> (abstract person / citizen / group / close and other social strata) and yours is estimated.  <b>It is a control test for the remaining ratings.</b>  That is, if, say, a method has passed a moral assessment, an assessment of effectiveness and satisfies you, but you are not significant circles of society, then you will have to give it up.  The most typical example of such a method is blackmail. <br><br>  So, in sum, we have a three-dimensional space with a beginning at point 0 (presumably - the moment of birth of a person), marked by vectors (dreams), goals and a hyper-goal.  There is a list of permissible methods, deselected by moral efficiency filters and a public filter.  And finally, there are subspaces that allow you to check with holistic information at any time. <br><br>  Getting started.  For setting goals we use mental maps (I hope everyone knows about these).  In the same maps it is more convenient to catalog and systematize tasks.  And if they are also connected with an electronic organizer, it will be generally wonderful.  Further, these goals are marked in space. <br>  Now you can proceed to the assessment of action.  Each action is a segment (for whom it is more convenient - it can use vectors), with the beginning at the end of the previous one and the end, which is calculated from three estimates (the rule of the diagonal of the parallelepiped, if someone suddenly forgot).  The time interval and a link to this action in the journal (mental map, organizer, diary, etc.) are inscribed. <br>  After some period of time, a common vector of actions begins to emerge, which needs to be corrected in relation to the macro objective.  At the same time, they constantly keep within the limits of permissible morality and public assessment. <br><br>  And now, finally, some lyrics and examples. <br><br>  Let's start with the lyrics.  This concept allows us to successfully achieve both micro-goals and medium-sized goals, as well as move towards macro-goals and / or dreams, while constantly improving ourselves.  In conjunction with mental maps and an electronic organizer, this concept, with its regular use, allows you to organize your life as efficiently as possible, while leaving a significant degree of freedom. <br>  Personally, this approach has helped me outline the future paths of my education.  And this is when using less than a month.  You simply take, calculate values ‚Äã‚Äãand draw a vector.  It's simple. <br>  The only negative - I can not yet find a suitable means of visualization.  Ideally, an arbitrary model of the universe with the possibility of dynamic links to other objects.  It‚Äôs somehow inexpedient to use 3-D editors, but I haven‚Äôt yet been able to find decent analogs to paper.  Therefore, all data processing is carried out in analog mode. <br><br>  Now the promised examples. <br>  I brought only the main and most ambitious use of this concept - the user's life.  But why not adapt this system for small tasks?  For example, to perform a single, but large project.  There is a macro goal, expressed in TZ.  There are methods.  There are goals and there are aspirations of the performer of this project.  Everything is.  Only society will be replaced by the customer, and the requirements are weaker (for example, the use of crutches is possible, but not desirable).  Or another example - the study of a foreign language.  Here it is better to use this system, rather than mental maps: each section of the language is a method of learning (grammar, vocabulary, phonetics, etc.).  Public control, most likely, will not.  The moral framework will be limited to the line "effectively inefficient."  But in general, it is the same system. <br><br>  I sincerely hope that this concept will help someone to live (as some local articles helped me) or will become a convenient tool for project management. <habracut></habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/143651/">https://habr.com/ru/post/143651/</a></p>
