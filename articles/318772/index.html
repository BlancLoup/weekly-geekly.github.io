      This FAQ is about GPLv3 only. <br>  &lt;br/&gt; <br><h2>  GPLv3 FAQ <br></h2><h2><br><br></h2><h3>  What does GPLv3 mean licensed? <br></h3><br>  This means that you can freely download, use, modify and distribute any files hosted in the Git repositories on pimcore.org under a license like GPL version 3, and run pimcore to combine with any code distributed under any license that is compatible with a GPL version 3 license, such as an Affero General Public License (AGPL) version 3 license. <br><br><h3>  Does the license apply only to PHP or all? <br></h3><br>  We require that all files (PHP, Javascript, CSS, images, etc.) that are not part of a linked third-party library (see <a href="">3rd-party-licenses.md</a> ) are available under GPLv3. <br><br><h3>  Copyright and Contributions <br></h3><br>  All pimcore contributors retain the copyright in their code, but agree to publish it under the same license as pimcore.  If you are unable or unwilling to submit a patch under the terms of the GPL version 3 license and the pimcore corporate license, do not submit a patch. <br><br><h3>  I want to publish my work under a different license, not GPLv3 - is it possible? <br></h3><br>  Not.  You may publish your work only under the terms of the GPL license version 3 or a later compatible license. <br><br><h3>  The GPL license requires me to distribute the ‚Äúsource code‚Äù of my files.  What does this mean for a web application? <br></h3><br>  The ‚Äúsource code‚Äù of a file means a format that can be edited by a human.  What this means depends on the specific file. <br><br>  For PHP code, the PHP file itself without any compression or obfuscation is the source code.  Note that in pimcore, controller / viewer files are PHP code.  For JavaScript code, the JavaScript file itself without any compression or obfuscation is the source code.  For CSS code, the CSS file itself without any compression or obfuscation is the source code.  For images, the concept of "source code" is different.  Depending on the image, this may mean a production version of the file, such as a PNG or GIF, or the original high-resolution JPG, or a Photoshop, Illustrator, or GIMP program file.  ‚ÄúSource Code‚Äù means any possible version intended for human editing. <br><br><h3>  If I create a module, plugin, or custom code for my application, should I apply the GPL license to them? <br></h3><br>  Yes.  Modules and plugins for Pimcore, as well as their own code for your application, are derivative works with respect to pimcore.  If you distribute them, you must do so under the terms of the GPL license version 3 or later.  In any case, you are not required to distribute them. <br><br>  However, when you distribute your pimcore-based work, it is important to keep in mind that the GPLv3 license applies to it.  The GPLv3 license for code is applied to code that interacts with code, but not data.  So, the PHP code pimcore is licensed under the GPLv3 license, and therefore all PHP code that interacts with it must also be licensed under the GPLv3 license or the GPLv3-compatible license. <br><br>  The images, javascript and flash files that PHP sends to the browser are not covered by the GPL, because it is data.  However, pimcore JavaScript, which includes a copy of jQuery that is included with pimcore, is distributed under GPLv3, so JavaScript that interacts with pimcore JavaScript in a browser must also be distributed under GPLv3 or with a GPLv3 compatible license. <br><br>  When you distribute your plugin, module, or theme, GPLv3 applies to any fragment that directly interacts with parts of pimcore, which is licensed under GPLv3.  This does not apply to images you create and flash files.  However, if you make a new image based on an image from pimcore, which is distributed under the terms of the GPL, then that image must also be licensed under GPLv3. <br><br>  If you uploaded a module or plugin to the pimcore Git repository, then all of your work must be licensed under the terms of a GPL license version 3 or later, and you must provide their source code.  This means all files in an editable format, as described above. <br><br><h3>  If I create a plugin, module or custom code for my application, should I provide it to anyone? <br></h3><br>  Not.  The GPL license requires that if you create a derivative work from pimcore and distribute it to someone, you must provide the person with its source code under GPLv3 terms so that it can be modified and distributed also under GPLv3 terms.  However, you are not required to distribute the code to anyone else.  If you do not distribute the code, but only use it in your organization, you are not obliged to provide it to anyone. <br><br>  However, if your plugin is a general purpose, it‚Äôs often a good idea to give the code to the community.  You can receive feedback, error messages and patches of new functionality from other people for whom your module will be useful. <br><br><h3>  Can I sell pimcore or a plugin for pimcore or a theme for pimcore? <br></h3><br>  Yes.  However, you must distribute it under the terms of the GPL license version 3 or later, so what you sell must also be available for modification and distribution.  See the questions above. <br><br><h3>  Can I write a ‚Äúglue module‚Äù for interaction between pimcore and another system or library? <br></h3><br>  It depends on the other system. <br><br>  It is acceptable to distribute a module that communicates with a third-party system via HTTP, XML-RPC, SOAP, or another wired protocol that leaves the third-party system unaffected.  Examples of such systems include Flickr, Mollom or certain dependency systems.  Examples of such systems include Flickr, Mollom or certain dependency systems. <br><br>  It is permissible to distribute a module that integrates with a third-party PHP or JavaScript library, for as long as the library is available under both a GPL license and a GPL-compatible license.  Examples of compatible licenses include ‚Äúpermitting‚Äù licenses such as BSD / MIT or Lesser General Public License (LGPL).  The Free Software Foundation maintains a list of popular GPL-compatible licenses. <br><br>  It is not allowed to distribute a module that combines with pimcore a library distributed under a license that is not compatible with the GPL, because such a derivative work will be a derivative work from both pimcore and another library, and thus there will be a violation of both the GPL and another license libraries.  Please keep in mind that this applies to some open source software licenses that for some reason are incompatible with the GPL, such as the PHP license used in most PEAR packages. <br><br>  If you wish to load the linker module into the pimcore Git repository, please do not include it in the third-party library.  Such an action will create a fork of such a third-party library, which will make support more difficult and only take up disk space.  Instead, provide detailed instructions for users to download and install such a third-party library for use with your module.  If you believe that your module is a special case that requires mandatory inclusion in the Git repository, usually only because you need to make significant modifications to its work, please post a question in the Licensing Working Group‚Äôs questions queue for an initial discussion of your question. . <br><br><h3>  Should I provide my site code to any of its visitors? <br></h3><br>  Not.  The GPL license does not consider viewing the site as a ‚Äúdistribution‚Äù case, so you are not required to provide code that runs on your server. <br><br><h3>  I have a question to which there is no answer here.  What should I do? <br></h3><br>  <b>If you have a question about a specific case, please consult a lawyer specializing in copyright issues in your area.</b>  <b>We cannot provide legal advice.</b> <br><br>  If you have a general question about pimcore licensing or other legal issues, please post your question in the pimcore discussion group. <br><br><h3>  Notifications / License of this manual page <br></h3><br>  This FAQ is based on <a href="https://www.drupal.org/licensing/faq">www.drupal.org/licensing/faq</a> (changed) - many thanks to the Drupal Association! <br><br>  License: Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike license 2.0 (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/) <br><br>  _____________ <br><br>  <i>approx.</i>  <i>per.</i>  <i>- My other CMS licensing translations:</i> <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/280228/">Drupal licensing FAQ</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/282205/">Backdrop Licensing FAQ</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/282243/">Joomla!
