To understand each of these tools helped Sergey Sklyarov - the head of the group on contextual advertising ArrowMedia (Kokoc Group). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/d56/a95/449/d56a95449d0293a53126d4ab102fe7d8.png" alt="image"><a name="habracut"></a>

      <b>Search advertising</b> <br><br>  Regular ads are classics of contextual advertising.  Google shows them in response to a user query in the search box.  Getting there is easy: just make an ad with keywords and set a maximum bid. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/d46/bc0/131/d46bc0131a1b5026eaf18e57234cc8ed.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Another type - <b>dynamic search ads</b> , which takes on some of the work of marketers.  The search engine robot scans the site pages with keywords and, based on them, creates advertisements that best fit the user's request. <br><br>  The tool is effective for low-frequency queries.  For example, a girl is looking for a ‚ÄúGreen Moschino Umbrella‚Äù in Google, and an online store has launched a classic advertising campaign for the Moschino Umbrella request.  The ad does not fully comply with the request, which means that the probability of a click on the ad is small and a potential customer can go to another resource.  Just in this case, it is worthwhile to connect the ‚Äúdynamic search ads‚Äù function.  Googlebot will scan the item cards, and if the umbrella has the green color in the catalog, the girl will see a relevant ad that will lead her to the necessary page of the site.  Thus, using dynamic search ads, you can increase the traffic on low-frequency queries by 20%. <br><br>  The addition of standard advertising can be search remarketing, with which it will turn out to return those visitors who were going to, but never made a purchase.  For example, Maria Ivanovna looked at the Tefal iron in the online store, put it in the ‚ÄúBasket‚Äù, but was distracted by the series and closed the page without completing the purchase.  A little later, the woman returned to Google search.  By setting the maximum bid for the key phrase ‚ÄúIron Tefal‚Äù or ‚ÄúBuy Iron‚Äù, you can return Maria Ivanovna to your online store, motivating you to complete the purchase. <br><br>  <b>Product Ads</b> <br><br>  With the help of Google Merchant Center (similar to Yandex.Market), an online store shows the corresponding product in response to a specific commercial request.  For example, if a son decided to donate a watch to a dad and entered the query ‚ÄúBuy watches‚Äù in the search box, in the right part of the search results he will see an advertisement for various models of watches with photos and prices. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/ab6/353/f9f/ab6353f9f11c3e4a6ea23b1a5659d7e8.png" alt="image"><br><br>  In order for dad to receive a gift from your online store as a gift, you need to prepare a data feed - a file containing detailed information about the product.  From it, Google Merchant Center robot will automatically load product information into the ad unit. <br><br>  By the way, users who come to product ads, make purchases more often than visitors from the search, because they immediately receive detailed information about the product and go to the site already with the desire to buy it. <br><br>  <b>Google Display Network Advertising (CMS)</b> <br><br>  The same tool that monitors Internet users and knows their preferences, therefore, shows the appropriate advertising.  When promoting in the CMS, the online store places ads and banners not on search results, but on Google partner sites, for example, YouTube or Gmail.com.  At the same time, the tool offers targeting for any needs: by user interests, topics, keywords, placements. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/5a7/81b/f42/5a781bf4230ba1ec04d3e791ea772fab.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The tool works with deferred demand - product advertising is seen by users who are not planning a purchase yet, but may become customers of an online store in the future.  In order to reach the audience of interest, you need to define a portrait of a potential buyer.  This can be done using Google Analytics: the system accumulates statistics on the gender, age and interests of the online store visitors, as well as the goods they purchase.  For example, analytics show that most often Bosch vacuum cleaners in the online store are women of 25-35 years old who are also interested in kitchen appliances.  It means that it is useful to launch an advertising campaign for vacuum cleaners on sites with recipes of dishes. <br><br>  Google CMS also has remarketing, which we talked about above.  Just like a good movie will not work without high-quality dialogues, a script is also needed to return visitors to the site.  Here are some examples: <br><br>  <b>View a specific category of goods</b> <br>  For example, a housewife went to the site of an online store in search of a washing machine, looked at several models, but did not make a purchase.  These statistics show that people who spent more than 4 minutes on the site and viewed more than 7 washing machines are likely to become buyers.  It means that the housewife needs to show an advertisement with additional motivation, for example: ‚ÄúGift: 15 kg of laundry detergent!  When buying a Zanussi washing machine today.  Last day of the action! <br>  <b>Adding goods to the "shopping cart" without buying</b> <br>  It is important to return the same housewife who was going to, but did not order the washing machine, not to the main page of the site, but to the ‚ÄúBasket‚Äù, where she could complete the purchase.  To do this, it is not bad to prepare a special motivating action or to be interested in a creative message, for example: ‚ÄúTake it away soon!  Your washing machine is sad and lonely in stock, come back! ‚Äù. <br><br>  <b>Repeated purchases</b> <br>  Suppose online store statistics show that regular customers purchase laundry detergent every two months.  So, you need to set up remarketing to display ads a week before the expected date of purchase, to remind you about your online store.  For example: ‚ÄúDoes laundry detergent end?  We care about you!  Laundry detergent Ariel with home delivery! ". <br><br>  When Google Analytics thoroughly examines visitors to your online store, it will offer ‚ÄúSimilar audiences‚Äù - groups of users who have never been to the site or were not interested in the product of your subject matter.  Google will track their interests and determine that they are similar to the interests of your online store visitors.  But be careful, the efficiency of working with "Like audiences" is low, it is useful to use them as an additional channel of promotion. <br><br>  <b>Gmail Sponsored Promotions</b> <br><br>  In September 2015, Google AdWords introduced a new tool - Gmail Sponsored Promotions (GSP), which allows users to show ads in Gmail‚Äôs personal mail in the ‚ÄúPromotions‚Äù tab. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/9c8/109/9aa/9c81099aafb3d45b605a2568ef1c050d.png" alt="image"><br><br>  To set up GSP, add the mail.google.com domain to target the advertising sites.  By the way, with its help, you can try to divert customers from competitors: users who receive a newsletter "from a neighbor" can see your ad, if in the "Keywords" tab specify a list of sites from other online stores. <br><br>  <b>Video advertising</b> <br><br>  Every Internet user will sooner or later watch a video with kittens or curious drops, and while people are laughing, you can tell them about your product.  Video ad serving is configured in the AdWords Video Campaign section.  Like Google‚Äôs CMS, the tool targets ads by keywords, user interests, video topics, specific video channels or remarketing lists. <br><br>  This way of promotion is suitable for familiarization with the product or increase brand awareness.  For example, according to statistics from an online clothing store, representatives of a female audience often purchase animal t-shirts.  An advertising campaign on YouTube for the request ‚ÄúVideo with kittens‚Äù, in which a promotional video will be shown before the main video, will significantly increase brand awareness. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/a63/132/f4f/a63132f4f938be861d1ed02ed0ae8148.png" alt="image"><br><br>  For videos in the search results of video hosting sites, it is important to come up with a creative title, an informative description and select an interesting picture as a cover in order to attract users.  Otherwise you will not be able to switch attention from kittens to your product. <br><br>  Choosing the type of advertising in Google AdWords depends on the goals of the advertising campaign, and maximum results, like a good cocktail, can be obtained only by shaking and mixing.  For example, to attract traffic, it is better to use search advertising and product ads, and correctly-tuned remarketing scripts on the Google Display Network are perfect for increasing sales.  Any type of advertising will have a high return in conjunction with video ads, because visualization is useful for familiarizing users with a brand or product. <br><br>  <b>Bonus - advertising mobile applications</b> <br><br>  If you are reading this article from a smartphone, it means that we are coming to you.  Google AdWords provides an opportunity to promote online shopping applications through the expansion of ads.  The application in search advertising will help increase consumer confidence in the store and increase the size of the ad, which will lead to an increase in clickability. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/e6b/5a3/29b/e6b5a329bfb594cf06f7c8ff38b29c14.png" alt="image"><br><br>  But that's not all.  Google AdWords allows you to run a separate advertising campaign to promote the application in search, CCM and YouTube.  Keyword targeting is customized in the Campaign section.  And for maximum results, you can use the advertising opportunities of other applications, choosing them by topic.  For example, place a banner of your online clothing store in the app of the women's site. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/fd9/e89/81a/fd9e8981a898ce163edb87805cb40ea3.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Source: <a href="http://rusbase.com/opinion/adwords/">RusBase</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/297130/">https://habr.com/ru/post/297130/</a></p>
