  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Jazz sounds better on vinyl.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> <a href="http://megamozg.ru/company/audiomania/blog/15796/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b56/977/a7f/b56977a7f8a94d848c3ba648552c1199.jpg" width="700"></a> <br><br>  <i>In our <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/audiomania/blog/">blog on GT,</a> we repeatedly paid attention to the topic of vinyl: <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/audiomania/blog/243065/">talked</a> about what was behind the return of vinyl, and criticized the CD and vinyl.</i>  <i>Today we will talk about the atmospheric history that Joe Peacock published on his Medium <a href="https://medium.com/human-parts/ive-become-that-guy-who-thinks-jazz-sounds-better-on-vinyl-and-all-it-took-was-losing-everything-1f6314c22eaf">blog</a> .</i> <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><blockquote>  I became the one who thinks that jazz on vinyl sounds better, and for that I had to lose everything </blockquote><br>  Joe was sitting on the couch and watched a record spin at the other end of the room on the player.  Plate.  Vinyl.  On the player.  For him, this sketch meant a dramatic change in life.  A couple of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Joe-Peacock/e/B002HSY6H6/ref%3Dsr_ntt_srch_lnk_1%3Fqid%3D1428673287%26sr%3D8-1">books</a> , columns in CNN and Huffington Post and now a blog on Medium.  Joe speaks of vinyl as something native, but just a few years ago, the very mention of a vinyl player caused him laughter and forced him to throw words like ‚Äúhipster‚Äù or ‚Äústupid useless audiophile‚Äù.  You can joke on this topic for a very long time.

    <blockquote>  Rental apartment.  Roommate.  East Atlanta.  Turntables.  I, two years ago, now sits inside of me and shouts: ‚ÄúDude!  What the hell is going on in your strange future! ‚Äù <br><br>  A purring cat sits on my lap, and in my hand I hold a cup of hot coffee.  The light notes of John Coltrane's saxophone float around the room, filling the air with cool calm.  The sun's rays fall on a freshly laid wooden floor, over which my friend and I cried when he was ready, because ... we were at home.  And we gradually settled down. </blockquote><br>  Another sketching on the subject of coffee: notes of coconut milk and butter give coffee and honey velvety shades.  Now he cares about such minor for many nuances.  Joe likes crossfit and he started a domestic cat.  He likes to listen to jazz in the morning, but two years ago he would not have been able to endure a couple of minutes of music. <br><br>  Two years ago, after months of discussion, scolding and showdown, he decided to divorce his wife.  Further more: a major supplier refused to cooperate with his company and the business had to be closed.  Joe had to sell his house, or rather he took the bank.  He moved to a friend, the time for journalism and sports flew almost imperceptibly. <br><br><blockquote>  Day after day, I woke up, went in for sports, wrote, ate tuna, wrote, played sports, ate tuna, and slept again.  The time came when I could no longer lie idle.  I needed a job.  I had to urgently stop inconveniencing Mike. </blockquote><br>  Joe talks about moving to Boston and finding work.  Work could help him cope with the experiences and bring himself in order.  He didn‚Äôt really find something worthy - the production companies were not eager to hire a guy who recently was only engaged in the dismissal of their employees.  I had to go back to Atlanta and continue my search there. <br><br>  What happened next: job interview at Deloitte and the first job for a large corporation in the last 8 years.  New job - new requirements.  "New look" Joe combined shirts from the 70s and 80s with dark blue jeans and boots and with a lot more than that.  It took him another year to build the foundation of life. <br><br>  After some time, he was able to return to the origins of his career and again engage in interesting Internet projects.  Now he can go to a hot shower whenever he wants.  He may not worry about the things he needs to sell to buy food, about the old business and the old studio, or about the house he built for himself and his former wife. <br><br><blockquote>  I love my life.  I hope that if you are desperate now, after reading all this, you understand that everything will be fine.  But you should adjust everything yourself.  In fact, you are the only one who can do this.  Believe me, everything must go.  When this happens, you will realize that everything that you cherished was your choice, and now, moving forward, you will be more selective. <br><br>  Pour yourself a cup of coffee (add there butter and coconut milk ... believe me - it is very tasty) and get ready.  You'll like it. <br><br>  ... And for reference, Coltrane really sounds better on vinyl. </blockquote><br> <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/audiomania/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a71/0fd/51d/a710fd51d2194dfb9f119b5b664a4d2a.jpg" align="left" width="200"></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/290948/">https://habr.com/ru/post/290948/</a></p>
