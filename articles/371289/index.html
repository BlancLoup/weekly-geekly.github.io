Oral culture was born. <br><br>  Then we have long invented the method and forms of fixation of oral speech, written language appeared.  Natural language has become the main means of communication and information transfer.  Born written culture.  These are two. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Literally not so long ago, one of the best representatives of our species invented the printing press, and not a few, but already huge human masses made the transition to written culture.

      And most recently they invented a telephone, telegraph, television, computer, Internet, which was the beginning of the era of digital culture.  Four. <br><br>  Surprisingly, the fact is that the last two revolutions have occurred due to the improvement of the signal transmission technology from the sender to the recipient. <br><br>  Let me continue the list of revolutions and say that the fifth was the transition from web 1.0 to web 2.0 and 3.0, marking the birth of a ‚Äúnetwork culture‚Äù.  At the same time, the term (status?) Of this transition is not so important; more important are the truly global changes in society that became apparent and began to grow at an amazing rate. <br><br>  In short, the first social networks, in the usual sense for us, appeared at the very end of the 90s in North America.  This is an English-language Learn and Classmates, which, by the way, is still alive and visiting.  The analogue of the last service of the beginning of the era of web 2.0, flowed into the web 3.0, in RuNet was the social network Odnoklassniki. <br><br>  The terms web 2.0 and web 3.0 appeared a little later, denoting the development trend of the Internet - the emergence of communities and a large number of services offering to unite in communities, interest groups, geographical principles, common biography, and so on;  create content, and not be passive by its consumer, create high-quality content.  The era of user generated content has arrived. <br><br>  Only in the first six zero years have such today's giants as Facebook, LinkedIn, My Space, as well as Cyrillic Learn, Odnoklassniki and VKontakte appeared in the Russian segment of the network. <br><br>  And ‚Äúethnetworks‚Äù have grown so fast that every third inhabitant of the Earth is now caught and made up (at least, is a user of Facebook).  And it will be true (or soon it will be) that every Internet user is a user of any social network at a minimum.  What is not a communicative revolution? <br><br>  But this is only the quantitative side of the issue.  If we look at this phenomenon from the position of qualitative changes, then we can say that there have been very serious changes in the public consciousness, the structure of mass communications, the features of interpersonal and group communications, the psychology of the Internet person.  I will outline briefly and only some aspects; discussion of them is a topic for a whole series of articles. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Consciousness has changed, namely the perception of a person. <br><br>  In the past century, McCluen noted that if printed media create the linear principle of codification and perception of the world, then electronic media determines the mosaic principle of world perception. <br><br>  For us, the current is obvious.  Different media create a different ‚Äúimage‚Äù of the world, pursuing the interests of different groups (state, business, political parties, etc.).  But unlike our moms and dads with their subscriptions to print publications, as well as the era of "TV viewing", we can switch between browser tabs and see the difference in the formed "pictures", we can get objective information about events by finding materials from uninterested eyewitnesses.  Why, we can become a source of news content ourselves. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Vertical communications system is becoming a thing of the past, giving way to horizontal links <br><br>  Until the 20th century, revolutionaries used a single but sure means ‚Äî they destroyed the vertical ties that had developed in society, replacing them with new ones.  Today, even the barricades do not have to climb.  Humanity is already fragmented to a single person connected to the Internet, a social network, and now you just need to be able to observe the behavior of this fragment, collect data.  ‚ÄúSmart machines‚Äù based on observations will create probabilistic scenarios of behavior, will be able to model, program the behavior of this fragment, giving what he needs and directing his attention. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ A special language for networking has appeared. <br><br>  Do you remember the old ‚Äúbear bears‚Äù, ‚Äúaftor zhzhot‚Äù?  And it is constantly evolving.  The current ‚Äústopitsot‚Äù, ‚Äúhapling‚Äù, ‚Äúsheer‚Äù, ‚Äúazaz‚Äù, ‚Äúhaiter‚Äù are already understood only by active users of the Internet and social networks.  English has its own examples, as well as in other languages.  In terms of linguistics, it is slang.  And the appearance of slang indicates the emergence of a cultural phenomenon in society.  In a networked society. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ feelings have changed <br><br>  The sensory lack of network communication leads to attribution errors: we are not always able to interpret the text message correctly, since there is a lack of non-verbal information: facial expressions, tone of voice, look, gestures.  And already, depending on our own state, we endow the content of the author with meanings and intentions.  And the notorious "Emodzhi" do not help us out, because the smiley can mean irony, sarcasm, a sympathetic or friendly smile. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Man has become content <br><br>  It's one thing when you communicate in social networks with your friends and meet them face to face in real life.  And if most of the communication takes place online?  If you have never seen a man, but subscribed to his news?  Here an interesting phenomenon arises: any text (including this article) can be easily challenged, the mind is cunning and cunning, and you can prove anything, just like to refute, (remember Kant).  It is possible to communicate with human text, human content as you please - compassion and empathy tend to zero, hence - including the phenomenon of incitement of adolescents to suicide through social networks, trolling.  Yes, and a simple ‚Äúvirtualization‚Äù of a living person.  He is no longer of flesh and blood, he is the hero of the story, and therefore is not real. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Personality multiplicity <br><br>  Now everyone can easily acquire a new personality from a special agent from a Hollywood film.  Create at least 100 accounts with different photos, names, data and do what you want.  Well, when it reflects the many-sided interests of the user and his inner world.  Or for therapeutic purposes: you took the name of a movie hero or a novel you have loved since childhood.  And if not?  This is very significant for dating services.  The fake industry is also flourishing on Facebook. <br><br>  I suppose that given quantitative and qualitative indicators to indicate the transition from web 1.0 to 2.0 and 3.0 by the ‚ÄúFifth Communicative Revolution‚Äù is enough.  Although the question is, of course, open to reflection, observation by Internet practitioners, sociologists, psychologists, linguists, and philosophers. <br><br>  But further more interesting. <br><br>  Artificial intelligence has already become a part of our life, while not on a planetary scale, but all this is similar to the development of social networks.  And development on the basis of AI for the Internet environment creates completely new types and types of communications. <br><br>  Now, in addition to the so-called ‚Äúcutting edge technology‚Äù (big data, blockchain, neural networks, crypts, predicative analytics), the applied field of cybernetics is actively developing - artificial intelligence and machine learning, used specifically in the Internet environment, in online services. <br><br>  Although often between the terms of AI and machine learning equate, but it is not synonymous.  AI development may have the ability to self-learning based on processing a large amount of data (machine learning), but can be created using well-defined algorithms to perform a narrow task and not have this ability. <br><br>  A striking example of this kind of development is Watson from IBM.  And the text, and speech, and voice and pictures recognize, and chat, and learn, and teach, just in the morning coffee does not brew. <br><br>  The social network Facebook has integrated the <a href="https://wit.ai/">technology of natural language processing</a> and the selection of ‚Äúobjects‚Äù in speech (a little more than 20 languages ‚Äã‚Äãalready, but not yet Russian) in their instant messenger. <br><br>  Also, a <a href="https://www.echobox.com/">special service has been</a> created for the Facebook network that helps publishing houses (and soon companies) post their content with unprecedented efficiency.  The development of AI, which has the ability to self-learning, creates a unique portrait of the target audience for a particular publication and adapts to the Facebook algorithm in real time.  We are waiting for the version for companies! <br><br>  Quite recently, the first smart <a href="http://sonetplan.su/">social network</a> for business using AI development appeared in Russia.  Combines all the features of a professional social network and a tool for project work.  Very timely, I would say, LinkedIn blocking in Russia did not close, but complicated the way for the international professional community to users. <br><br>  And there are already a lot of variations on the theme of Eliza's old-school interlocutor, Joseph Weisenbaum!  In medicine, education, insurance, <a href="https://www.pandorabots.com/">advertising</a> , <a href="https://www.textrecruit.com/">HR</a> .  The Japanese have already released a " <a href="https://gatebox.ai/hikari/en/">virtual wife</a> ."  The context of "philosophical communication" was changed to the context of "recommendations" and earned.  The current chat bot is not just a program that simulates a conversation, but a system that tries to predict the best answer for your interlocutor.  The best of them <a href="https://www.ipsoft.com/">try to</a> use ‚Äúemotional intelligence‚Äù and adjust the tone of the response to the client in order to bring about its location.  In general, chat bot you in the slot. <br><br>  MMORPG developers are not lagging behind.  There is already a special concept of ‚Äúgame artificial intelligence‚Äù for imitating the behavior of a combat unit, a miscalculation of the trajectory in 2 or 3-dimensional space. <br><br>  Elpis.Global entered the list of projects that passed the IIDF accelerator in 2018.  Based on machine learning algorithms and an impersonal database of medical tests from partner laboratories, it helps doctors quickly and more accurately diagnose. <br><br>  Now, not only a person interacts with a person on the Internet, but also a ‚Äúmachine‚Äù interacts with a person.  Directly, as in the case of chat bots, and indirectly - as in the case of other examples, ‚Äúartificial intelligence‚Äù takes over the functions of a person, ‚Äúinvisibly‚Äù acting and greatly expanding the capabilities of the latter.  A culture of a completely new type of communication is emerging.  Network culture now contains 2 types of communicative horizontal links: HI + HI and AI + HI.  ( <i>HI - human intelligence</i> ) <br><br>  And the user generated content (ugc) competition is now ‚Äúartificial intelligence generated content‚Äù (AIgc).  Google Magenta writes music, the Japanese AI wrote a short story and passed the first qualifying round in the national literary award in 2016. <br><br>  The sixth communicative revolution? <br><br>  Yes, God would be with them, with the names.  What's next?  Is the author man dead?  Will die?  When?  Who now communicates with you in skype / telegrame / viber?  How will our perceptions and feelings change and change?  Would not AI-wife be an alternative to a full-fledged relationship?  Where it leads?  Does a special ethic exist in relation to artificial intelligence?  Is it ethical to send chatbot to ***?  Will we animate the interlocutor, as animate plush toys in childhood?  And our children will be in 10-15 years?  Will not our grandchildren perceive us as ‚Äúthe simplest versions of chat bots‚Äù? <br><br>  What modern professions will disappear as the transfer of functions to the "smart machine"?  Accountant, personal assistant, hr, teacher, consultant?  What new skills are needed for the development of AI and implementation in everyday life? ... <br><br>  Thanks for the time and attention. <br>  It is interesting.  We'll keep thinking. <br><br>  <i>Lana Minina</i> <i><br></i>  <i>digital communications consultant</i> <i><br></i>  <i>researcher of virtual reality and mass communications</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/371289/">https://habr.com/ru/post/371289/</a></p>
