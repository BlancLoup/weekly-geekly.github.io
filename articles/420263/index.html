The Knowledge18 conference is a unique event that allows you to keep abreast of the latest achievements in this field, get acquainted with the best practices and promising products of ServiceNow, as well as share experiences with other users of the platform. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/00/mb/oe/00mboeb-tvgu_m2pdgltviw5vp8.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>What happened in Vegas stays in Vegas.</b>  <b>Everything except "Knowledge18"</b> <br><br>  <b>The Knowledge18 conference</b> was held from 8 to 10 May in Las Vegas (USA, Nevada) at the Venetian Hotel.  The conference was attended by over 18 thousand people (magic number 18).  In total, about 300 sessions on various topics were held on Knowledge18, 120 of which included practices for developers.  At the same time, 85% of sessions were conducted not by ServiceNow, but by their clients, which once again confirms the advantages and usefulness of the platform for various types of organizations and goals.

      I was amazed how the organizers managed to accommodate, feed and occupy so many people.  Sessions were held on four underground floors in 20 conference rooms, each with a capacity of 100-150 people.  In the exhibition complex "Expo", the size of a good stadium, fit all 18 thousand participants.  There were stands for the main products of ServiceNow and partner companies, presentations were held. <br><br>  In the main hall for 10,000 people, major speeches were held.  There was also a closed pavilion, where ServiceNow experts sat.  They could ask questions of interest on specific topics, but it was necessary to sign up for the day.  The organizers turned into a dining room a huge underground parking.  Surprisingly, despite such a number of participants, we have never stood in a queue! <br><br>  <b>Better world</b> <br>  <b>(Make the world full of work, work for the good of the people)</b> <br><br>  The conference began with a keynote speech by ServiceNow Director General John Donahoe, who spoke about the company's strategy and mission.  According to him, the main idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe company is to make the place of work of a person, where he spends a third of his life, more effective, more satisfying.  The work forms a person, determines how he feels, how he interacts with other people, I'm sure Donahue.  ‚ÄúAnd when we do our job as well as possible, the world around us gets better,‚Äù said the head of ServiceNow. <br><br>  In 2018, according to Forbes magazine, ServiceNow topped the ranking of the most innovative companies in the world ( <a href="https://www.forbes.com/feature/innovative-companies-service-now/">link to the source</a> ).  It would seem that there are tools for managing services on the market for a very long time, but it was ServiceNow that brought this to the level of TOP innovation.  At the same time, a couple of years ago the company did not even enter the TOP-100 of this rating. <br><br>  Last year, the company's revenue reached $ 2 billion, and the market value reached $ 30 billion. In 2012, after a successful IPO, the company was worth $ 2 billion, but 13 years ago, 63-year-old company founder Fred Laddy, now a billionaire, and then actually bankrupt, alone developed the main product ServiceNow at home. <br><br>  Also, many ServiceNow clients spoke at the conference.  As a vivid example of the use of IT to improve labor efficiency, I liked the presentation of the representative of the medical company Magellan Health.  This is a network of hospitals in the United States, in which, prior to the implementation of ServiceNow, they spent a lot of time filling out medical records, which we are all familiar with in Russian realities.  The introduction of the platform has reduced the time of administrative work, and the doctors were able to focus on their main purpose. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ub/ie/qj/ubieqjakvxfg32zfm5jhq08nthq.jpeg"><br><br>  <b>Travel to the future in world capitals</b> <br><br>  ServiceNow calls its releases with the names of cities and releases them every six months.  For example, at the end of 2017, Jakarta came out, and in the summer of this year, Kingston is preparing for release.  His main theme is machine learning for everyday work.  ServiceNow tries to make machine learning as adaptable as possible for practical use. <br><br>  The Kingston Engine Intelligence machine learning module will analyze data for all incidents.  For each new - the program will select samples with similar keywords and patterns and send to the appropriate team.  This will bring tangible benefits to the Service Desk, especially when classifying applications and incidents initiated through a portal or chat bot.  An ordinary user does not know how to categorize them and which team to send to solve.  Therefore, this automation will provide significant assistance.  Of course, there will be errors, but insignificant. <br><br>  <b>Performance Analytics</b> is an advanced reporting option (Reporting Services) that shows all the statistics and team performance. <br><br>  <b>No code process automation</b> are modules for integrating and building workflows (graphical descriptions of workflows).  Since it does not need to be coded at the same time, business analysts and functional experts will not be able to do this work, but not IT specialists.  They will be able to configure systems, for example, to configure integration with the messenger, with hippchat.  For example, that in some chat there were notifications that something such an incident was created and through it it was possible to confirm some requests or add comments with a ticket. <br><br>  I must say that today, the developers slowly began to worry, seeing such prospects.  ServiceNow makes this process easier, and over time it will select their bread.  The future is in configuration, not coding. <br><br>  <b>All service life cycle in one application</b> <br><br>  After the "Kingston" at the end of 2018 will be "London".  It will contain innovations.  For example, this is the <b>ITSM Agent Workspace</b> module <b>.</b>  This is an updated analyst workspace in Service Desk that receives applications.  It gives you the opportunity to see the general and command queue with incidents and requests, the built-in chat within the ServiceNow of the group to which it belongs, notifications for the bricks of an incident or request. <br><br>  Another module is the <b>Walk-Up IT Service Experience.</b>  It is a tool for local commands that users access directly.  Usually, to register a job, they need to go to ServiceNow every time and describe what the user came with for statistics.  With this application, users will be able to independently log create incidents on their tablet, choosing the type of failure or query.  Our craftsmen from the local team made the same self-written application, and we integrated it with ServiceNow.  If it is interesting, I can share how.  So often we are even ahead of progress). <br><br>  In the summer of 2019, Madrid will be released, the main feature of which is the module for managing the entire life cycle of the service.  This is an administrative module in which you can do everything ‚Äî both to create a service concept and send it to the scrap.  All document flow takes place inside the system; neither Excel, nor e-mail, etc. are required.  Everything works in one ecosystem, in which you can then see how it all began and how it ended. <br><br>  <b>Best customization practices</b> <br><br>  Excessive efforts in this area cause difficulties: if you change the code a lot, when switching to a new version, a lot of problems arise - it collapses, and the improved functionality floats.  Of course, ideally, one should adhere to the principle of ‚Äúzero customization,‚Äù but this is not always the case, business demands.  At the customization management session, they talked about how to minimize business requirements for the use of existing functionality, and how to do this with the least amount of problems, if necessary. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/dq/gg/op/dqggopm0ymomf_umh5-gnffsvuc.png"><br><br>  <b>GDPR Compliance - ServiceNow proves that you can comply with policies.</b> <br><br>  On May 25, 2018, the new EU General Regulation on Personal Data Protection (GDPR) became a widely discussed topic.  The law applies to all companies that process personal data of EU citizens.  Now, any user can request a full report where his personal data was used.  And if a person has worked for 20 years in a company, he may have access and accounts in dozens of systems and documents.  All this is to put together in one report - an extremely trivial task, a big headache for IT.  And if an organization recognizes an inappropriate GDPR, then it will be charged a penalty of 4% of annual turnover.  ServiceNow has developed a GDPR implementation module.  It can track everything that happens with user credentials.  Implementing this module is easy, but attaching it to all databases is a very difficult task. <br><br>  Another important topic is corporate data security.  Everyone remembers the virus "Peter".  From this point on, the topic of security, corporate server vulnerabilities has become an even higher priority.  This module scans IT systems, finds vulnerabilities, automatically registers and prioritizes them, sending a request to the appropriate system, SCCM, for example, immediately adds a packet to the server that meets the updated security requirements. <br><br>  <b>Inject Robotics, happy man!</b> <br><br>  In general, we can say that the future, in terms of IT automation, is the user's communication with the chat bot.  He creates a request, then another bot executes it and sends the result to the user.  Like, you asked for access to a shared folder or mailing list, or create an account, here's a password.  To this is added machine learning, which helps identify incidents and predicts the appearance of problems.  Mars is mastering all the most innovative approaches to IT automation.  We are already developing Chat Bot and Robotic Process Automation. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fx/5w/yv/fx5wyvdbpiwmyfbags_oun_ufbi.png"><br><br>  In the London release, ServiceNow announces a built-in Chat bot module.  In general, it has the same functionality as the Microsoft Bot framework or IBM Watson, but with one clear advantage - it is already fully integrated.  No need to spend dozens of hours integrating with Requests &amp; KB.  As soon as new ones appear, the bot immediately recognizes them and can offer the user.  Among other things, ServiceNow positions itself as an ITSM platform for assessing the performance of bots, for example, how many bots made requests per day, how many were left in the queue, because they could not perform, at what time it was done, etc. <br><br>  The future of IT in the light of ServiceNow is an end-to-end automatic process, from creating a request using a portal or ChatBot (a) to later executing it using integration or RPA.  To this is added machine learning, which helps identify incidents and predicts the appearance of problems.  And, apparently, the future has come. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/420263/">https://habr.com/ru/post/420263/</a></p>
