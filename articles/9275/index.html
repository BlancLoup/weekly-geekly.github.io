  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Microsoft was defeated near Moscow</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Victor Zudenkov, the manager of the Unitechnoplast plant accused of illegal production of disks with Microsoft software, was acquitted by the court of Lobnya.  Microsoft, acting as the injured party, intends to appeal the verdict to the Moscow Regional Court. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Another court hearing took place in the court of the Lobnya town near Moscow in a criminal case against Viktor Zudenkov, general director of the Yunitekhnoplast plant in November 2005. The judge of the Lobnensky court Stanislav Rozhkov told CNews that the defendant was acquitted on procedural grounds.  A representative of Themis refused further comments, confirming only that Microsoft, acting as the injured party in the case, could appeal the verdict in the established legal order. <br><br>  The reason for the acquittal is the same as about six months ago, said in an interview with a CNews correspondent Alexander Fear, a lawyer at Microsoft.  The judge considered that the case had been initiated in an improper way and had been investigated by an inadequate authority.  "Microsoft intends to appeal the verdict to the Moscow Regional Court within the prescribed 10-day period," said Mr. Fear.  ‚ÄúThe case was investigated by the prosecutor‚Äôs office of the Central Administrative District of Moscow, and, according to the judge, should have been investigated by the prosecutor‚Äôs office of the city of Lobnya.‚Äù <br><br>  Recall that Mr. Zudenkov was accused of copyright infringement and abuse of official authority.  In November 2005, employees of the 9th Division of the Office for Combating Economic Crimes of the Main Directorate of Internal Affairs of Moscow conducted a search on the territory of Unitechnoplast, in connection with which a criminal case was initiated: illegal production of CDs from leading world manufacturers was discovered in the premises rented by the plant.  During the investigation, it turned out that Microsoft was damaged in the amount of about 2 billion rubles.

      According to the law, Zudenkov was threatened with up to 5 years in prison or a fine of up to 500 thousand rubles.  The trial of the Director of Unitechplast was the first major Russian lawsuit in a copyright infringement case against a counterfeit manufacturer.  Recall that the activation of the fight against piracy is one of the main conditions for Russia's entry into the World Trade Organization. <br><br>  <a href="http://tlanvar.blogspot.com/">tlanvar</a> <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/9275/">https://habr.com/ru/post/9275/</a></p>
