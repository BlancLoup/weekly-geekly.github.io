  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Russia is creating a national strategy in the field of artificial intelligence</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The Government of the Russian Federation is <a href="http://kremlin.ru/acts/assignments/orders/59898">tasked</a> to develop a national strategy in the field of artificial intelligence before June 15, 2019  The presidential instructions did not indicate the details of what this strategy should be, only the date is indicated. <br><br>  For example, you can look at a similar strategy in China.  Unlike the Russian one, it was adopted several years ago and is now being gradually implemented. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In 2017, the PRC State Council published the Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan, which outlined the main points of China‚Äôs strategy to become a world leader in this field, with an AI industry estimated at almost $ 150 billion. The first step of this plan is to to catch up with the United States in 2020 in the development of technologies and applications that use artificial intelligence. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6d8/c19/b7e/6d8c19b7ebffe9dcc8e2b033a3ebc0fe.png">

      As a result, China is already ranked first in the world in the financing of AI.  For example, in 2017, 48% of the global investment in the capital of AI-oriented start-ups came from China.  For comparison, similar investments from the United States amounted to 38%, and only 13-14% accounted for all other countries combined. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c6c/517/61b/c6c51761b8e49de8a846b513182165b4.jpg"><br><br>  The Chinese AI strategy involves three phases: <br><br><ul><li>  Stage 1: "Competitiveness in the field of AI" - 2020.  Main focus: big data intelligence, autonomous intelligent systems, cross-medium intelligence, swarm intelligence, hybrid advanced intelligence, fundamental theories in AI. <br></li><li>  Stage 2: Breakthroughs - 2025  Artificial intelligence will be widely used in medicine, urban infrastructure, manufacturing, agriculture, in building national defense systems, in the application of laws and regulations, as well as for assessing safety and the ability to exercise control functions. <br></li><li>  Stage 3: World Leadership - 2030.  The organization of social management mechanisms, including the activities of government bodies, the construction of national defense systems and the building of global value chains. </li></ul><br>  Of course, Russia cannot even close and cannot compare with the world leaders in the field of AI in the future, but clearly does not want to pass by the world trend.  At least in some industries, at the level of individual start-ups, Russia is quite competitive.  For example, Russian companies occupy one of the first places in the quality of face recognition in international competitions. <br><br>  As Vedomosti <a href="https://www.vedomosti.ru/technology/articles/2019/02/28/795313-dlya">writes</a> , by February 25, the government and Sberbank had to submit the first proposals on the content of the national strategy (they did not publicly do this).  But according to the representative of the Deputy Prime Minister Maxim Akimov, the government prepared the proposals on time (again, without disclosing their content).  The representative of Sberbank declined to comment. <br><br>  Expert opinions on this subject differ.  For example, Alena Drobyshevskaya, director of the IT consulting group at KPMG, believes that the state is interested in developing AI for applied tasks, such as recognizing machine numbers, in order to write out fines. <br><br>  Artificial intelligence helps to recognize the voice to identify the interlocutor: this system is well combined with the "Spring Laws", according to which operators are required to store all voice traffic in mobile networks.  Voice identification is being introduced everywhere in government agencies and in companies.  Autoresponders robots and more advanced chat bots that work on company sites and call centers are also very popular. <br><br>  Nikolai Knyazev, the head of the Jet Learning Machine Learning Group, believes that if the national strategy defines a vector of tasks, not constraints, the initiative will very quickly have a positive effect.  And Igor Bogachev, the CEO of Numbers, is not sure about the need for a strategy - the sphere is developing so quickly that it is too difficult to fix it in the document.  He believes that the state should not formulate tasks, but stimulate companies, laboratories and researchers, create conditions for investment, protect intellectual property.  And the market participants will choose the directions themselves. <br><br>  The founder of Ubic, which is engaged in processing and analyzing big data, Vitaly Sattarov, in a commentary to Vedomosti, said that the main difficulty in working with AI technologies is to get access to qualitative data for analysis.  Accordingly, the state should define the rules for the market and the procedure for accessing data, as well as formulate the legislative basis for the application of artificial intelligence algorithms. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/442024/">https://habr.com/ru/post/442024/</a></p>
