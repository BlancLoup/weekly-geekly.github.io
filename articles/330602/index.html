You are not quite sure how you will behave at the interview in the company, which you really want to get into?  You experience an incomprehensible jim-jams in the subway on the way to the first meeting with the personnel officer and forget to ask what kind of salary you will have on your hands after the trial period?  If at least one of these questions you answered yes, then I think this article will be interesting to you.  I will not teach you how to behave in an interview, how to hold hands, where to look and how to answer questions.  I can tell you how to gain confidence and get rid of fear. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Honestly, I comprehend Zen and have peace of mind of the Dalai Lama sitting opposite the HR director, IT director and chief accountant I personally did not immediately.  When you go to the university exam, when the Gaitz slows you down, when the big-boss causes you - that same inexplicable and unpleasant feeling has always been with me.  It would seem that he learned everything, did not break anything and did not seem to get anywhere, but still here it is, right there.  And although I am not strong in epithets and metaphors, but I am sure you all understood what I mean and you all know this feeling.  It really hinders.  It makes you distract from the really important tasks, mislead you, makes you make mistakes, makes you unsure of yourself.  I will share how I got rid of this feeling. <br><br>  The book by D. Carnegie ‚ÄúHow to stop worrying and start living‚Äù had a huge impact on this.  She certainly does not give instructions like ‚Äúdo not piss‚Äù, but gives a fairly large list of ‚Äútools‚Äù how to really lower your level of ‚Äúexcitement‚Äù at times.  I will not bring them, because those who want to change something in their life can familiarize themselves with it.  I will only give you my own tool, which I indirectly derived from this book.

      Go for an interview. <br><br>  Yes it is.  At least once a month.  And it is better 2-3 times a month.  Until the counter reaches 15. Unfortunately, British scientists do not say anything about these numbers, but I think this number will be enough for the HR manager to hear your steel eggs from the corridor already at the 16th interview.  What do I need to do?  Post your resume on a popular resource and from time to time monitor it for new vacancies.  Saw a vacancy about you - respond.  Respond to junior and timlid being middle.  Respond to the lead developer as a yesterday intern.  Respond to everything that is more or less relevant to your profession, and where you could be taken with a stretch or without.  Try it all. <br><br>  What will it give you?  Firstly, already during the first telephone conversation with a representative of the personnel service you will notice IT.  You will notice that you worry significantly less.  Because you will not care.  Because you have a job, where you generally like and pay well.  And ‚Äúthey‚Äù want a person of your qualification, but for 15-20 tr.  cheaper.  And there are ‚Äúthey‚Äù in South Butovo with ‚Äú15 minutes by shuttle bus from the metro‚Äù.  And it is the absence of excitement that will allow you to ask any questions you like.  About the work schedule, about dinners, about the availability of a coffee machine, about insurance and a paid gym, but about anything.  The second time you feel it, when you first go to an in-person interview.  And again for the same reason.  You will not care.  You will not care whether you fail or not.  Can you cope with the task of writing a bubble method on a piece of paper or will you make an impression of ‚Äúresponsible and executive‚Äù on the personnel officer?  And it is precisely this ease of communication and a bunch of counter questions that you are not afraid to ask now, you will make an additional impression on the evaluating side, because believe me, the number of candidates who ask more than 2-3 questions on duty at the interview is actually very small. <br><br>  Secondly, you will know the market.  In six months, you will have an excellent view of the labor market.  You will know for how long you will find a job for the current (-10% of the current) salary level.  You will know what requirements they put to the candidates, what questions they ask, what they expect to see.  You will know what awaits you if you pinch the wife of the financial director in the office party.  You will be much quieter to go into the offices of bosses and big-bosses.  You can promote your opinion, defend your point of view, because you don't care.  Because you will no longer be afraid of losing your job.  Because you know that in the last six months alone you received 4 sentences with the same conditions.  Because you know that it is simply not realistic for you to find a specialist equal to your firm at the current rate (companies you have been in have been looking for months with the same budgets). <br><br>  Thirdly, each job-offer you receive will give you +5 to the length.  Understanding that you are appreciated and called to yourself really raises self-esteem.  And if you do not call back - so again - do not care.  You are not going to them. <br><br>  Fourth, you can get a really good offer. <br><br>  Good luck) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/330602/">https://habr.com/ru/post/330602/</a></p>
