  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Shout it out?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <i>The world of IT in 2011: some fanatics call other fanatics fanatics.</i>  <i>(with)</i> <br><br>  The theme of holivar is very popular in Habr√© - in fact, this is one of the main activities of its readers.  But, oddly enough, I will not touch on the topic, who is cooler - Windows or Linux, Android or iPhone, (you can do this later in the comments).  Instead, I want to talk about the very nature of holivars, as well as the prerequisites and consequences. <br><br>  It is always very interesting for me to watch holivars, sometimes I take part in them myself (rather from boredom than from need).  <i>(Thanks to the admins of Habra for a two-month ban - now I can ignore any holivars.)</i> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  But I was always interested in another question - why do holivars arise?  After all, in essence, IT-people are going to - <s>like</s> smart people who make their living with brains (?).  Well, there grandmothers quarreled, which father is the best - Orthodox or Catholic, or the children got into a fight because of a dispute who is better - Schwarzniger or Stallone, but why IT people?  After all, it is worthwhile to write in any holivar that ‚Äúall deposit‚Äù, ‚Äúyou need to select your technologies and tools for each task‚Äù or ‚Äúyou must write not <b>in the</b> language but <b>with the</b> use of the language‚Äù, as everyone immediately agrees.  Moreover, a recent survey showed that most do not care what to write on, if only they would pay money.  <i>So what's the deal?</i>

      Let's first think, maybe the militancy of IT people in the blood?  And the principle of self-regulation (as in Habr√©) is the power of the crowd?  Hmm, a good idea, but, in my opinion, not true.  Let's look at StackOveflow, which is a very good example of a self-regulating system and developing on the basis of User Generated Content.  <b>There are no holivars!</b> <br><br>  I almost did not see a situation where the author of the wrong answer under the approved cries of the crowd impaled, sent to ... Google or wrote that he was!  Yes!  stupid ass, and even Penkin's blood brother!  Moreover, in order to earn a "minus", we must also try. <br><br>  There are several reasons for this situation: <br><br>  - resource administrators close any question that may seem to some moderators too subjective and holivar; <br>  - duplicates are stopped and closed immediately; <br>  - the more answers the user has given, the more <b>real</b> rights on the site he has; <br>  - the higher your rating, the <b>real</b> you are better off (the link to the SO Profile solves a lot of problems when dealing with different people); <br><br>  Compare with Habr and other similar systems. <br><br><blockquote>  But what about your opinion, tell me?  Everyone has the right to opinion !!!  I have even seen the term ‚Äúopinion‚Äù somewhere when you have an opinion.  And shit.  ¬© </blockquote><br><br>  We are mostly outsourcers, i.e.  <s>Cattle</s> coders, most of which are called not by name, but by the cost of an hour of work.  Those.  approximately like this: ‚Äúwe have 10 <i>persons</i> for $ 20 / hour, 5 for $ 30 / hour and one beast-timblide for $ 50 / hour‚Äù.  And no names before signing the contract.  This sometimes leads to paradoxical situations. <br><br>  Situation number 1.  One student works 4 hours a day after attending university in the fourth year.  But according to the documents, he is "two full-time senior developers".  The funny thing is that a person did not work in this company for a year and a half, but he regularly received his salary, for two. <br><br>  Situation number 2.  Customers will find out that their project is half a year headed by a 22-year-old timlid who will soon have to go to take the product to them.  The project manager has a shock, but nothing can be done.  Who knew that in Ukraine such young timlids? <br><br>  These situations speak of one problem - the average age of our IT specialists is extremely small - less than 30 years.  This leads to the fact that every person who graduated from a university and having installed Joomla on his knee already considers himself a guru.  More precisely, not so - he comes to another gavnoktorku, which type is engaged in the development of sites, gets the position of super senior account R &amp; D manager and begins (as he believes) to do mega-complex tasks - to typeset IE6, answer calls or set up mail.  But even here, problems await him - IE6 is a curve, customers are stupid, and the spam filter in the mail works somehow not at all.  And it does not matter that the person was expelled from the university, he never opened a single book in the last five years and did not even read the manual for 5 pages.  Angry "guru" comes to his favorite place - Habr, Lor, Dow (underline) and begins to pour out the problem of his whole life, forgetting about the important <a href="http://fucking-great-advice.ru/advice/7788/">rule</a> . <br><br>  Why am I doing this?  To the fact that the older we get, the more perplexing all kinds of holivars cause, the easier it is to comment on a person‚Äôs IQ and his IT age. <br><br>  Holivary fools, smart give advice.  It is very important to learn to distinguish one from the other. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/118928/">https://habr.com/ru/post/118928/</a></p>
