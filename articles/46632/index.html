  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Smart task scheduling with todoist</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  A good <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/silenced/" class="user_link">silenced</a> person <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/silenced/" class="user_link">has</a> recently advised me a very convenient task scheduler, who has been searching for a long time and unsuccessfully.  I share joy with habrasoobshchestvu - a detailed overview of the <a href="http://www.todoist.com/">Todoist</a> task scheduler from <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/silenced/" class="user_link">silenced</a> (the author does not have enough karma to publish, and useful information should belong to the people :) <br><br>  I really love to plan my tasks and I recommend <a href="http://www.todoist.com/">Todoist</a> service for many years, which I have been using for almost a year.  However, many, after registering and looking around a little, leave the site and successfully forget about it.  If you ask about the reason for leaving, in response you usually get something unintelligible, and then it turns out that the person simply does not know about all the possibilities of the service. <br>  Especially for those who are too lazy to dig and look at the description on the site, I decided to devote a separate article to this service. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  And so, for starters, what attracted me so much in this todo list? <br><ul><li>  The site is not overloaded and looks very clean; </li><li>  Well thought out hotkey system.  Manage tasks can be almost without being distracted by the mouse; </li><li>  Quite convenient syntax when describing tasks and search queries; </li><li>  <a href="http://mail.google.com/" title="Mail from the conqueror of the world">GMail</a> integration, a handy Sidebar for <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/firefox" title="One of the most popular browsers">Firefox</a> and a nice plugin for <a href="http://www.launchy.net/" title="Quick launch applications">Launchy</a> . </li></ul><br>  ‚ÄúOh, hotkeys.  Never liked them (a) or syntax for describing tasks?  Is it really impossible with a mouse? ‚Äù, Someone will say.  Of course, for you there are monsters like <a href="http://www.rememberthemilk.com/" title="About the milk did not forget?">Remember The Milk</a> or <a href="http://planner.zoho.com/" title="Zoho's Famous Planner">Zoho Planner</a> .  I do not like?  Well, then be patient a little bit, I will try to convince you and everyone else, and perhaps interest you in such a wonderful service as <strong>Todoist</strong> .  After all, working in it is really easy and convenient. <br><habracut><br>  And so, what is the <strong>Todoist</strong> ?  And it is a logo and two panels, one of which is reserved for tasks, the other for searching and a list (or tree) of projects.

    <img src="http://www.silentroach.ru/images/pages/todoist_main.png"><br><br>  So far everything seems to be clear: on the right we have a list of tasks from the project chosen on the left or what we have found by a search (top left). <br>  Next we will look at <strong>Todoist</strong> on close to real situations.  So it will be easier and probably more interesting.  And so, my wife wrote to me in the gmail-box that I really needed to go to the nearest hypermarket and buy there a lot of things.  And, of course, attached a huge shopping list: <br><ul><li>  A kilogram of potatoes; </li><li>  Mineral water; </li><li>  Any magazine to read; </li><li>  Several finger batteries. </li></ul><br>  We need to organize all this and, having printed a piece of paper, go to the supermarket on the way from work.  Or, alternatively, not to print anything, but to check on the spot directly through <strong>Todoist</strong> from a mobile phone or PDA.  At the same time get used to the fact that we need to read with us at least once a week, preferably on Fridays. <br>  We define that there will be two global projects on our site: ‚Äú <strong>Work</strong> ‚Äù and ‚Äú <strong>Personal</strong> ‚Äù.  There will be no tasks in the projects, but there will be subprojects. <br>  And so, we create a project - click on <em>Add Project</em> and see the appeared input field where we can enter a description.  Confirm the creation with the <em>Enter</em> key, and refuse with the <em>Esc key</em> . <br>  At the same time learn some useful chips: <br><ul><li>  To create a parent project that does not contain tasks, as well as parent tasks that do not require a check mark, you can put an asterisk (*) at the very beginning of the description; </li><li>  With the <em>Ctrl + Up arrow</em> and <em>Ctrl + Down arrow keys</em> in edit mode, you can move from one element to another, higher or lower, respectively; </li><li>  The key combination <em>Ctrl + Right arrow</em> and <em>Ctrl + Left arrow</em> we can control the nesting of elements.  Those.  in order to make an element nested in another, you need to select it and press <em>Ctrl + Right arrow</em> ; </li><li>  A useful reference <em>Reorder</em> (the same effect is obtained with the <em>r</em> key) both in projects and in the task list allows us to redistribute the list with a simple muscle Drag &amp; Drop (for those who do not understand: you can drag the elements with the mouse). </li></ul><br>  <strong>Attention!</strong>  The most useful hot key in the system is <em>?</em>  (question mark).  Use it more often until you are comfortable;) <br>  And so, we created two global projects (yes, with an asterisk at the beginning).  A curious user has already clicked on the arrow to the right of some project and chose the color you like.  Then created in the project " <strong>Personal</strong> " subproject " <strong>Shopping</strong> ". <br>  What is this zero to the left of the project name?  Yes, this is the number of active tasks in the project.  Now we will fix this case and add some task inside.  Here, everything is absolutely the same as with the projects, but you can add a new task without the help of a mouse, simply by pressing the ‚Äúa‚Äù button (in the Latin layout).  We create the main task ‚ÄúRun through the shops‚Äù and add the list sent by mail to us. <br>  Already more or less accustomed to adding items?  Well, it's time to learn something new: <br><ul><li>  Each task we can assign the time of its execution, for this there is a <strong>Date</strong> field.  For now, we'll write there <em>today</em> (today), and closer to the end of the article we will get to know a little closer to the syntax for describing dates.  Yes, I almost forgot about reading - we put <em>every friday there</em> (every Friday).  Really, is it convenient? </li><li>  You can add a task from GMail if the <a href="http://todoist.com/Help/viewGmail">appropriate plugin is</a> installed.  In this case, the task will take the form of a link leading directly to the box to the letter; </li><li>  Tasks can be prioritized.  Either through the menu using the arrow to the right of the task (the <strong>Priority</strong> item), or by adding a piece of the form <em>! P3</em> (3 in this case, priority) to the task description; </li><li>  Tasks can be assigned tags (then it is quite convenient to search for them).  To do this, add to the description of the task, for example <em>@ purchase</em> ( <em>purchase</em> here is the name of the tag); </li><li>  Description of tasks can stretch;) To transfer the caret to a new line, there is a combination <em>Ctrl + N.</em> </li></ul><br>  Fuh how much he has written.  But really, it's pretty simple?  But more and almost nothing to talk about.  We have described a simple project and will be able to further develop ourselves. <br>  Forgot about searching?  No, I did not forget.  There is nothing to write about him.  He can find any tasks: by tags, priorities, dates.  Contextual search is not a very important component, but it also exists, although paid users (at the time of writing this article, this is $ 3 per month). <br><br>  <strong>A bit of background information for the most curious.</strong> <br><br>  Task clearance: <br><ul><li>  Text selection% (b) <strong>bold</strong> % </li><li>  Allocating% (i) <em>italic</em> % </li><li>  Highlight% (u) <u>underlined</u> % </li><li>  Almost like% (hl) marker% </li><li>  And this is how we make the ‚ÄúLink‚Äù: (http://www.todoist.com) </li></ul><br>  Grouping of allocators occurs right inside the brackets. <br>  For example, highlighting% (biu) <em><u><strong>in bold, underlined italic</strong></u></em> %. <br><br>  Description of dates: <br><ul><li>  <strong>tod</strong> or <strong>today</strong> - today; </li><li>  <strong>tom</strong> or <strong>tomorrow</strong> - tomorrow; </li><li>  <strong>month_n</strong> is the indicated date of this month; </li><li>  <strong>month_number / month</strong> - the specified day of the specified month; </li><li>  <strong>month / month / year</strong> - and so it is clear; </li><li>  <strong>day_week</strong> (in English, in full or abbreviated format) - the specified day of the week; </li></ul><br><ul><li>  The <strong>every</strong> prefix includes repetition; </li><li>  The <strong>next</strong> prefix indicates the following; </li><li>  After <strong>@</strong> you can after the date (or its definition to specify the time). </li></ul><br>  <strong>useful links</strong> <br><ul><li>  <a href="http://todoist.com/m">Mobile version of the service</a> ; </li><li>  <a href="http://todoist.com/Help/viewWidget">Widgets</a> for <a href="http://www.google.com/ig">iGoogle</a> and <a href="http://www.netvibes.com/">NetVibes</a> ; </li><li>  Especially for programmers - <a href="http://todoist.com/API/help">API</a> for interacting with Todoist; </li><li>  Plugins <br><ul><li>  <a href="http://todoist.com/Help/viewSidebar">Sidebar</a> in Firefox; </li><li>  <a href="http://todoist.com/Help/viewGmail">Integration with GMail</a> in Firefox; </li><li>  For <a href="http://todoist.com/Help/viewDashboard">Dashboard</a> ; </li><li>  <a href="http://todoist.com/Help/viewLaunchy">Launchy</a> ; </li><li>  <a href="http://todoist.com/Help/viewQuickSilver">QuickSilver</a> . </li></ul><br></li></ul><br>  Hopefully, I don‚Äôt have much time looking at my head and I believe in the successful development of <strong>Todoist</strong> . <br><br>  This is not my first post on Habr√©, but I'm still ready to listen to all the comments and suggestions. <br>  Goodbye, boys and girls. </habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/46632/">https://habr.com/ru/post/46632/</a></p>
