  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Eight ways to demotivate your employees</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  If you have firmly decided to bring your employees to a white-hot, but have not yet figured out how to achieve this, simply follow the instructions below and you will achieve success. <br><br>  <b>Encourage the initiative.</b>  Managers love this word.  It means that employees should not only react, but rather react in <i>advance</i> , which roughly means simpler management.  No need to give employees any documentation, specifications, and indeed information - let them take the initiative and look for everything themselves. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Punish excessive initiative.</b>  If any employee likes to do any nonsense such as documenting processes (which could simplify training newly hired workers), developing your own tools (which would save you time and money), refactoring code, or applying agile methodology, just ignore his efforts, quote corporate policy, do not give him any support - in short, use all the tools of influence that you have in your hands.  Dismiss his proposals for improving the situation - you can say ‚Äúno!‚Äù To your eyes, or you can make fun of you by saying ‚Äúyes and yes!‚Äù And letting his project rest quietly in the Bose. <br><br>  <b>Do not allow managers to go into details.</b>  In no case do not nominate anyone who understands the subject to managerial positions.  In this case, things can go too smoothly, since such a person will be able not only to speak with the team in her language - but also to understand deeply what this team actually works on.  Instead, hire someone from the outside who is solely in control (wears a leather daddy and / or an iPhone, gathers rallies, talks about things without the slightest understanding of them, while often meaningless, but solid).  The less your manager is familiar with the team - the better: in the end, in a war they shoot at soldiers, not at generals.

      <b>Reward employees.</b>  Just before raising someone's morale, think about the rest of the team (or other teams).  Well this is a no-brainer: to raise morale alone means to lower it to everyone else!  Therefore, reward those who do not deserve it - for example, those who are crucified, what benefits it brings to the company, instead of silently bringing it. <br><br>  <b>Take away their tools.</b>  If your employees need something for work - computer, OS, database, some utilities, then the best thing you can do is take it all away from them, and not immediately, but in turn - to prolong the agony.  If they need commercial products - say that they do not have a budget allocated for them;  if open source software - say that it does not correspond to some internal norm and requires special permission (which, of course, no one will give).  Let them fill out countless forms and write emails.  Do not renew their licenses.  Let them work with a server located on another continent, with a guaranteed 10-second delay.  Do not let them use putty to work in the console.  Crush them on the sly, while not reducing the requirements for their work. <br><br>  <b>Do not let them concentrate.</b>  Sign them up for every single mailing list - including those that have nothing to do with their area of ‚Äã‚Äãresponsibility.  Let them spend hours reading and manually sorting mail.  Eliminate all ways to quickly identify what does not concern them.  Your best weapon is an open plan, when hundreds of people work in a huge room without a single partition.  Encourage loud ringtones, forgotten phones on the desktop and talk over a cup of coffee - let the rest get distracted!  Arrange meaningless meetings and conference calls for those to whom the subject of conversation does not apply in the slightest. <br><br>  <b>Send an employee to refresher courses.</b>  Only that they are strictly obligatory, and have nothing to do with his interests or with the work he does. <br><br>  <b>Get them often.</b>  Make sure that all bugs are carefully labeled as ‚Äúurgent‚Äù.  If someone breaks the code (especially if he does it all the time), don't let him fix his mistakes;  let someone else do it (best of all, if he sees this code for the first time) - and in an excessively short time.  Allow anyone to reassign bugs to anyone - especially without considering the current employment status of developers;  ideally, so that it was impossible to find out who did it. <br><br>  If you think that this will not work - do not worry: it will work.  Tested on living people.  (On me personally.) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/302234/">https://habr.com/ru/post/302234/</a></p>
