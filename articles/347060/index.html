And other reports for tmlidov with HighLoad ++</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  We continue the review of the most popular reports HighLoad ++ 2017 on the topic of team leadership.  In this part, we will talk about speeches for leaders that have already taken place - first of all about the movement from the team leader to higher posts.  Well, let's talk a little about psychology. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e6f/39c/9fc/e6f39c9fcd4be34c849a6761ab032dd0.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The speakers in the <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/oleg-bunin/blog/346760/">previous section</a> have already warned future tmlids that climbing the administrative ladder reduces the share of ‚Äútechnical‚Äù and ‚Äúcreative‚Äù components in work in favor of minor management tasks.  However, the speakers from the second part of our review claim that things will only get worse.  More administrative tasks and responsibility, less time for direct work.  But if the soul to this lies, do not miss your chance.

    <h2>  As I was a team leader, and now - the head of the direction </h2><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RevF1_cQ4Uc" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <a href="http://www.highload.ru/2017/abstracts/3022.html"><i>Report Theses</i></a> <br><br>  Finding yourself a deputy is the primary task of every leader.  In his report, Vitaly Sharovatov (Badoo company) speaks about growing timlid, but not from the point of view of the ‚Äúsubject‚Äù himself, but from the position of the newly appointed manager, who urgently needs to look for a potential replacement in the team. <br><br>  Why in a team?  Because the speaker, like his colleagues from the first part of our review, believes that engineers are better guided by engineers.  However, not any techie can approach this position, since for successful leadership it is necessary to ‚Äúgrow‚Äù administrative skills.  The career path in the direction of the manager is only one of the possible options for the development of a specialist, and not everyone needs it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e9a/b97/96f/e9ab9796f70af46f7b244c71894f1376.png"><br><br>  Vitaly presented an intuitively developed, but well-formalized approach to the selection, appointment and subsequent support of the team leader in the team, which gradually eliminates unsuitable candidates.  Yesterday‚Äôs developers will like this look.  On the other hand, his approach seemed very "human" - at every step there is an explanation of how to do all this comfortably for the people around.  For example, the process of appointing a new manager is considered from the point of view of the expectations of the team entrusted to him, as well as the subsequent introduction of a specialist in the course of business. <br><br>  The approach proposed by the speaker requires a lot of time from the manager at the initial stage.  Vitaly believes that a beginner timblid should literally be led by the hand, building processes with him and examining the difficulties that arise.  However, these costs cover the risks - repairing a ‚Äúbroken‚Äù, crooked leadership team will then be much more expensive. <br><br>  The conversation is filled with practical advice on all aspects of the path of the newly-born Timlide.  But, unlike the reports of the first part, the councils are not intended for the team leader, but for his leader. <br><br>  One of the main ideas, to which the speaker pays a lot of attention, is creating a semblance of a Soviet card file with regularly updated information about employees and even internal scoring.  Along the way, Vitaly disassembled the human qualities important for the Timblid, providing all this with simple life examples. <br><br>  All the details in the video. <br><br><h2>  How to kill a techie in the head </h2><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dmDkFrxwnuM" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <a href="http://www.highload.ru/2017/abstracts/3105.html"><i>Report Theses</i></a> <br><br>  Although engineering background is important for a development manager, in some situations it will interfere with effective management.  In his report, Alexander Trofimov and Dmitry Machekhin (Kaspersky Lab) talk about what "tech-nary" habits will interfere with a developer who is just starting his way along the administrative scale. <br><br>  For a visual illustration of the skills needed for a manager, Alexander suggested that those present draw a picture of his oral TK.  When viewing the report, we recommend not to skip this part, but to try to participate.  After the presentation of the image of what the customer actually wanted, a number of aspects of the work of the manager will literally feel in their own skin. <br><br>  The main idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe report is that by becoming a leader, a specialist stops being directly responsible for the system - he is responsible for the people who create it.  And in an unusual situation, he can get into one of several standard ‚Äúambushes‚Äù.  The report will discuss two of them - those that the speaker got into: attempts to do the work for Krivorukov (according to the newly minted manager) subordinates and abuse of authority, that is, the desire to remake the whole "monastery" under its "charter". <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d37/fad/109/d37fad109b6d11cc90985479d7ef4ae2.png"><br><br>  The main message of the report is that you have to be moderate in your desire to do everything in your own way, both in terms of technology and from other points of view (work schedule, management details).  People need to be trusted, learn to delegate, and direct their forces to higher-level tasks. <br><br>  Despite this spoiler, we still recommend watching the video, as the abstract advice ‚Äúnot a trifle‚Äù is remembered much worse than a chain of vivid personal examples with the analysis of the results obtained on a real team. <br><br>  In addition to the video, we also did a full <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/oleg-bunin/blog/346808/">transcript of this report</a> . <br><br><h2>  STO: dreams come true? </h2><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qydM-Dpx9vI" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <a href="http://www.highload.ru/2017/abstracts/3057.html"><i>Report Theses</i></a> <br><br>  A report by Roman Ivliev (ivliev.info) - on how the work of a technical director (CTO) actually looks through the eyes of a man who has passed all administrative levels, starting from an ordinary techie. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d77/130/c8b/d77130c8b9674774901b5ddb203b04ec.png"><br><br>  From the lower levels of the career ladder, it sometimes seems that CTO is engaged in something incomprehensible, and after all he has so much good in his hands: a whole technological team that can solve complex tasks and is ready to go for it in the fire, ‚Äúand in the water, and on Sunday work "(in the words of the speaker himself).  However, as Roman says, to the team, the ability to make their decisions and take responsibility for them, ‚Äúbonus‚Äù goes a lot of related matters - personnel, budget, endless meetings with heads of other departments, housing and utilities issues (where and how to plant a new employee) and terrible abbreviation - FOT.  The Technical Director has to learn to objectively evaluate people, follow the market, look for ways to keep good specialists and solve a lot of other issues. <br><br>  Starting with such a ‚Äúbarrel of tar‚Äù, the speaker spoke about the typical ‚Äúdiseases‚Äù of the engineer at the CTO site.  About what qualities should be left in the past, and which skills, on the contrary, should be improved.  How hard it is to promote a technical idea in a company through talking about terms, risks and budgets.  And that the results of the CTO are not visible even in comparison with the timlids (in the reports of the first part of the review there was a conversation that, unlike an ordinary developer, the team did not have the ability to quickly assess the results of their actions; and the higher the level - it is more pronounced).  But the mistakes of the technical director are visible almost immediately. <br>  The whole story is filled with very vital examples from Roman‚Äôs own practice. <br><br>  In general, the report once again shows that from the top of the administrative ladder, a look at technical problems is quite different.  But since this is not the leadership of the entire company, despite the fact that the CTO sees many factors, it is not always able to assess their impact on the situation as a whole. <br><br>  The report will be useful to those who are moving up the administrative branch of development.  As Roman noted, if a manager wants to return to programming, this should be done as quickly as possible, since the technological stack is changing at an unimaginable rate.  And this ‚Äúview from the inside‚Äù will help the experts to once again assess whether they want such a development. <br><br><h2>  Resistance in the work of the team and its ‚Äúnice‚Äù scenarios that lead the development of the team to a standstill </h2><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hGQW-SdDpcU" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <a href="http://www.highload.ru/2017/abstracts/3079.html"><i>Report Theses</i></a> <br><br>  Instead of conclusion - a slight immersion in the psychology of teamwork.  Despite the cunning methods of the personnel department according to the assessments of psychological compatibility, team building and other moments, there is always something that prevents the team from developing.  The report of Alexander Ziz (Aletheia Business) tells about what typical problems are found in 100% of the development teams (and not only). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/af9/c36/1f8/af9c361f8c5049a211ab68bba69c8ee5.png"><br><br>  Alexander's report is valuable in that, despite the enormous amount of theory on team interaction, the root causes of these problems have long been known - they have not been fundamentally solved.  To understand this mess, we need practice and experience.  But at the same time understanding what exactly is most actively manifested in IT. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/87a/21a/9bc/87a21a9bcfcf068bed8fcb5036ee56a6.png"><br><br>  Interestingly, the Russian registration of the company also adds its own specifics. <br>  However, we will not engage in retelling ‚Äî we recommend turning to the video of the report for details. <br><br>  In the course of the conversation, an expert recommends literature, refers to researchers - in general there will be something to read.  For example, ‚ÄúThe Kamikaze Way.  How a software developer can survive a hopeless project ‚Äù(Edward Youdon) is about the system level of work with the team, although this book also leaves much behind the scenes. <br><br>  However, the speaker warns against independent action.  In order to maintain a comfortable work environment, he recommends all psychological conversations with employees with the help of invited consultants.  As for the information from the report and literature - they are for the purpose of self-reflection. <br><br>  For those who want not to think, but to act, Alexander offers a step-by-step five-point development strategy (in the lower right part of the slide): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c19/a09/ec3/c19a09ec34eac7407cc9c114860cef28.png"><br><br>  Duplicate the <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/ah341sxg9obnjpr/mg.pdf">link to the questionnaire</a> .  But before you rush to print it, see the report itself. <br><br><hr><br>  Friends, we want to remind you that the next stage of the exchange of experience in team leadership and management will be held in early February at the conference <a href="http://teamleadconf.ru/">TeamLeadConf 2018</a> .  And on the conference site you can find videos of the ten most interesting performances last year. <br><br>  By the way, you can still jump into the outgoing train and <a href="http://speakers.teamleadconf.ru/">submit a report</a> .  What to say?  We have <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1okklO7EJwYnBwgFJQI0untOkM3WnAwtLLBPdNhvyIVg/edit">brainstorming results on this topic</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/347060/">https://habr.com/ru/post/347060/</a></p>
