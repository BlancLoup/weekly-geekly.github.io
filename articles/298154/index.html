      You could not help but hear that content is king.  And the main thing is quality.  And the quality of content is determined by how fully, objectively, comprehensively, volumetrically and objectively the text answers the reader's questions. <br><br>  It is believed that in the issue of Google on the first pages will be the page that meets all these criteria to a greater extent than similar pages on other sites. <br><br>  It is believed that, in addition to quality, other factors influence the position, for example, the age of the domain - the one that is older than the years, is more important.  Content size - ‚Äúlong‚Äù texts are better perceived by search engines.  In general, there are a lot of opinions on this subject.  So let's understand. <br><br>  <i>The article in the topic - <a href="">Marketing longrid - the main format of commercial text</a></i> <br><br><h4>  What to measure and analyze with content intelligence? </h4><br>  <b>Let's first determine the factors that matter in content intelligence:</b> <br><br><ul><li>  Amount of text </li><li>  quality, </li><li>  literacy, </li><li>  readability, </li><li>  accuracy of data </li><li>  completeness of the topic </li><li>  interesting, </li><li>  visual design of the page, </li><li>  key pages, </li><li>  placement on third-party sites, </li><li>  activity and popularity in mass media, </li><li>  presence of content types on pages (text, photo, video, graphics, multimedia, audio), </li><li>  positions. </li></ul><br><br>  As you can see, there are not so many factors.  All of them are clear and logical.  But which factors are more important and which are not?  This is a more difficult question.  And hardly anyone knows the definitive answer to it. <br><br>  Therefore, we resorted to the help of experts who have been working in this field for years.  This will help us get a more objective understanding of content intelligence.  Get ready for a lot of expert opinions and try to take the best from them. <br><br>  <i>Article in the topic - <a href="http://boosta.ru/content-marketing/kak-uvelichit-kolichestvo-repostov-kontenta/">How to increase the number of content reposts</a></i> <br><br><h4>  Expert Opinions on Content Intelligence <br></h4><br>  Content intelligence: why and how to do?  (16 expert opinions) Dmitry Shakhov, director and founder of the REMARKA studio, BalticDigitalDays conference: <br><br>  The simplest, but not the most correct thing is to study competitors in the TOP or competitors with a lot of user traffic to articles.  The most correct, but long and difficult, is to find your way by ‚Äúmeasuring‚Äù the reaction of users. <br><br>  <i><b>Katerina Zolotareva, SEO specialist, founder of Imseo:</b></i> <br><br>  The first thing is to look to competitors from the TOP-3 Google.  It is best to look not at the old trust resources, but at the new market players.  What do they write about in their lyrics?  What is the length of the texts, what terms that increase relevance, they use? <br><br>  An additional way is latent-semantic analysis of texts or, in other words, finding semantic relationships in the text.  If you describe briefly its meaning, then first you need to analyze all the same texts of competitors with the help of special content analyzers.  For example, the same Pr-cy. <br><br>  Then we exclude from there words that do not carry an important meaning (us, we, etc.), change cities and addresses to ours (if they are in the text) and get a ready-made template of text that you should navigate on your site. <br><br>  <i>Article in the topic - <a href="http://boosta.ru/content-marketing/prokachaj-kontent-marketing-16-rabochix-sposobov-chast-1/">Upgrade content marketing: 16 working methods.</a></i>  <i><a href="http://boosta.ru/content-marketing/prokachaj-kontent-marketing-16-rabochix-sposobov-chast-1/">Part 1</a></i> <br>  <i><b>Alexander Sitnikov, Head of Magway Promo Internet Marketing Agency:</b></i> <i><b><br></b></i> <br>  Neither Yandex nor Google can yet independently understand the quality and usefulness of the text.  Their task is different - not to determine how good the text is by itself, but how much it responds to a specific user request.  Search engines rely on specifications: <br><br><ul><li>  uniqueness, </li><li>  the number of occurrences of the key in the text </li><li>  the presence of thematic words </li><li>  spaminess </li><li>  text formatting (titles, lists, tables, illustrations), </li><li>  the content of the query in H1, title, </li><li>  text size and other quantitative indicators. </li></ul><br><br>  Users help search engines in determining the quality of texts, sending social signals (sharing a page, links in social networks) and leaving links on forums and blogs.  Behavioral factors are also evaluated: time spent on the page, click-through rate from search, return to search results. <br><br>  Interaction with the site is monitored by Yandex Metrika and Google Analytics, click on the value from the issue in Yandex Webmasters and Google Webmasters. <br><br>  <i><b>Maxim Denisenkov, head of the SEO department of the Bryansk office of TRINET Group:</b></i> <br><br>  For a large text to be really useful, it must provide answers to the user's true questions, and not to those that come up to the copywriter. <br><br>  <b>We use various methods to identify user problems:</b> <br><br><ul><li>  we conduct a survey of business owners, figuring out the most frequent questions, </li><li>  monitoring topics in thematic forums and in communities </li><li>  we look at the available statistics (requests that come to the site, wordstat statistics, etc.), </li><li>  Standard items, based on the type of site (for example, for service sites - to introduce the service, describe the benefits, convince to make a call or leave a request). </li></ul><br><br>  <i><b>Julia Ramyalg, Internet marketer, co-owner of the web-studio MySite.ua:</b></i> <br><br>  It is necessary to analyze not only the text content itself, but also the places where they are divided, i.e.  view competitor reference profile, social metrics.  But it is even more important to understand how all this fits into the overall strategy: what kind of content the competitors use, for whom, how often they publish, where they spread it, what kind of response they get. <br><br>  For this, I use ahrefs.com, majesticseo.com, tools for analyzing social profiles.  You can use semrush.com, prodvigator.ua to analyze the search traffic of competitors, including that obtained by using content.  Tools such as pr-cy.ru can give a general idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe structure of the text. <br><br>  <i>Article in the topic - <a href="http://boosta.ru/content-marketing/prokachaj-kontent-marketing-16-rabochix-sposobov-chast-2/">Upgrade content marketing: 16 working methods.</a></i>  <i><a href="http://boosta.ru/content-marketing/prokachaj-kontent-marketing-16-rabochix-sposobov-chast-2/">Part 2</a></i> <br><br>  <i><b>Rusfet Kadyrov, SEO-expert:</b></i> <br><br>  The main thing is whether the article will affect the conversion, answer visitors' questions and push them to action.  With the help of the service ahrefs, you can analyze the popularity of your content among users of social networks and the dissemination of information in social networks, and this is now the main thing. <br><br>  Also for wordpress there is an excellent Social Metrics plugin, in which you will see the data with all the published articles and social buttons to them: Twitter, Facebook, Google+, StymbleUpon, Digg and LinkEdin.  Each button has a counter that shows the number of clicks "Share" for each article, and this is the popularity of the content. <br><br><h4>  Text Analysis Services <br></h4><br>  <b>If you need to analyze the site with thousands of pages, experts recommend using special programs:</b> <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="http://www.seopowersuite.ru/website-auditor/">www.seopowersuite.ru/website-auditor</a> , </li><li>  <a href="https://glvrd.ru/">glvrd.ru</a> , </li><li>  <a href="https://prodvigator.ua/">prodvigator.ua</a> , </li><li>  <a href="http://pr-cy.ru/">pr-cy.ru</a> , </li><li>  <a href="https://www.etxt.ru/antiplagiat/">www.etxt.ru/antiplagiat</a> , </li><li>  <a href="http://simple-seo-tools.com/">simple-seo-tools.com</a> , </li><li>  <a href="https://www.gogetlinks.net/">www.gogetlinks.net</a> , </li><li>  <a href="https://askusers.ru/">askusers.ru</a> , </li><li>  <a href="https://just-magic.org/">just-magic.org</a> , </li><li>  <a href="http://www.rush-analytics.ru/">www.rush-analytics.ru</a> , </li><li>  <a href="http://spywords.ru/">spywords.ru</a> , </li><li>  <a href="http://www.similarweb.com/">www.similarweb.com</a> , </li><li>  <a href="https://saitreport.ru/">saitreport.ru</a> , </li><li>  <a href="https://www.semrush.com/">www.semrush.com</a> , </li><li>  <a href="https://ru.ahrefs.com/">ru.ahrefs.com</a> , </li><li>  <a href="http://buzzsumo.com/">buzzsumo.com</a> , </li><li>  <a href="https://www.google.com/webmasters/">www.google.com/webmasters</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://webmaster.yandex.com/">webmaster.yandex.com</a> , </li><li>  <a href="http://arsenkin.ru/tools/sp/">arsenkin.ru/tools/sp</a> . </li></ul><br>  <i><b>Alexey Danilin, senior SEO-specialist at netpeak.net:</b></i> <br><br>  We use our internal tools to analyze content in Netpeak.  From third-party tools are interesting features of WebSite Auditor (part of SEO PoweSuite).  The tool allows you to analyze the TOP and modify its content under it: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/219/e1a/0b8/219e1a0b8e29edcbdfa172dcb62e8b17.png" alt="image"><br><br>  To check the uniqueness of the texts, you can use eTXT Antiplagiat.  Install the program, run, insert your text - and in a few seconds you get the result.  Although in itself high uniqueness does not indicate that the content is of high quality. <br><br>  To clean the text from the "garbage", you can use the service Glavred.  Insert text and correct the errors that the service highlights.  By the way, I advise you to subscribe to the newsletter of this company.  You will periodically receive a portion of very useful information on the compilation of correct texts. <br><br>  If you are really going to make the content better than everyone else, then the process is more important than any technical characteristics of the text.  Good content is unlikely to succeed without researching topics, expertise or experience.  Collect such material that will be very difficult for someone to re-collect or become the first to tell about something. <br><br>  To see how your content sees the search engine compared to its competitors, look in Progressor for reports on potential traffic for pages on your site and competitors' sites.  For example, for the Moz.com website, you can see the pages with the most potential traffic: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/615/976/604/615976604bc4f5ed8cc8dbd5fa7b1638.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Similar data can be obtained from semrush.com, similarweb.com, ahrefs.com, buzzsumo.com. <br><br>  Of all these services, you can build statistics on your pages and the pages of competitors: traffic estimates, likes, sheyra.  It remains only to analyze it and understand the advantages / disadvantages of your content. <br>  <i>Article in the topic - <a href="http://boosta.ru/web-analytics/oni-pomogut-najti-vsex-ubijc-konversii-10-otchyotov-v-google-analytics/">They will help you find all the "killers" of conversion - 10 reports in Google Analytics</a></i> <br><br>  <i><b>Nikita Semenov, General Director of SECL Group Ukraine:</b></i> <br><br>  Usually we use Simple-seo-tools.  This service has all the factors that are worth paying attention to.  Usually estimated the amount of text, the availability of photos, videos, titles. <br>  <i><b>Zakhar Ermishkin, Head of Marketing at SetMeFirst:</b></i> <br><br>  To compare myself with the TOP, I use the built-in features of GoGetLinks: for 490 rubles a year, they do real miracles outside of Hogwarts. <br>  <i><b>Vitaly Kravchenko, head of the agency Webline Promotion:</b></i> <br><br>  Not so long ago, we conducted a small experiment with the service for user evaluation sites AskUsers.  We provided two text pages for the same service for user evaluation.  Of course, this turns out to be expensive for small and medium-sized businesses, for a large volume, but to evaluate a page text that generates sales for hundreds of thousands, the result was obvious. <br><br>  Plus the fact that we could choose a target audience according to the portrait.  At the moment, we have not found adequate analogues, but we hope that in the near future more tools will appear to work with content. <br><br>  <i><b>Anton Zhironkin, head of the group of optimizers Rush-Agency:</b></i> <i><b><br></b></i> <br>  Just-magic service is very well suited for text analysis, namely, 2 tools: ‚ÄúText analysis‚Äù and ‚ÄúWatercolor‚Äù.  The first tool will help to see the real picture by the volume of texts and the density of keywords to get into the TOP, and the second one will prompt the thematic words that it is desirable to use when writing. <br><br>  <i>Article in the topic - <a href="http://boosta.ru/ab-testirovanie/advice/kak-uvelichit-konversiyu-30-korotkix-sovetov-dlya-internet-marketologov/">How to increase conversion - 30 short tips for internet marketers</a></i> <br><br>  <i><b>Alexander Denisov, SEO-specialist of WEB-GOLDEN studio</b></i> <br><br>  My copy of the copywriter text consists of three parts.  In the first part I give a cluster of requests to which this text should respond.  For clustering semantics, I recommend the Rush Analytics service. <br><br>  In the second part, I give the copywriter directly the keys that need to be inserted into the text.  I take the keys based on the texts of the TOP.  To get them, I use the text analyzer of the just-magis service (I advise beginners to be more careful with this service, because sometimes the service gives too many entries for one text).  From there I give an approximate text size.  I do not set the size of the text to verified copywriters, they make it based on the topic for its full disclosure. <br><br>  In the third part I give the desired words to be used.  I collect them with the <a href="http://arsenkin.ru/tools/sp/">service of</a> Alexander Arsenkin. <br><br>  <i><b>Sergey Tsyganyuk, SEO-specialist of Boosta.biz company:</b></i> <br><br>  When analyzing our texts and those of our competitors, we use our own development, which was created based on the personal experience of the company's leading specialists and modern technologies.  As for me, this is the perfect combination.  However, if you do not need to evaluate a huge amount of texts on a daily basis, then you can safely use publicly available services. <br><br>  By the way, very soon we will post our text analyzer on Public, and everyone will be able to evaluate its advantages and analyze their own and competitors' texts quickly and usefully.  If you want to start using our development right now, then you can become one of the beta testers by sending a corresponding request via the feedback form on the Boosta.biz website. <br><br>  Own developments in the form of analyzers can be recommended to large companies that have experienced specialists in the team who are able to convey in detail to the programmer what is required of him and what needs to be seen at the output. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/4c7/d08/416/4c7d084164fb9fe7614acfd2af879c80.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/632/694/1b0/6326941b040ed332ad054660409936e8.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The screenshot shows all these characteristics.  It is also important to note here once again that the service allows us to compare our page with TOP-20 or our own list of competitors. <br><br>  Article <i>in the topic - <a href="http://boosta.ru/growth-hacking/a-vy-znaete-chto-takoe-growth-hacking-11-kejsov-vnutri/">Do you know what Growth Hacking is?</a></i>  <i><a href="http://boosta.ru/growth-hacking/a-vy-znaete-chto-takoe-growth-hacking-11-kejsov-vnutri/">[11 cases inside]</a></i> <br>  <i><b>Alexey Slavgorodsky, SEO Project Manager, SEMatic:</b></i> <br><br>  We start the analysis with Spy Words - in two clicks we get absolutely all the words and key phrases by which the competitor‚Äôs site was and is being searched, i.e.  it is his live visibility, and not the requests that SEOs do.  Very often the site owner himself does not suspect what words are there.  Even people far from internet marketing can use this information to build the content strategy of their site. <br><br>  PR-CY has a lot of free widgets for quick content analysis, and the Best competitor's analyzer - Foreign Web.  For in-depth analysis, we use parsers - I recommend SiteReport of all available, it gives a large number of reports in which you can seriously dig, see errors and correctly use this information for optimization.  For more non-standard tasks that require large projects, you have to write your scripts and parsers. <br>  <b><i>Konstantin Makarov, CEO of SendPulse:</i></b> <br><br>  To understand the "visibility" and "findability" of content by search engines it is necessary, first of all, to follow all the recommendations of the search engines themselves.  Both Yandex and Google have search consoles that help site owners understand content weaknesses and fix them. <br><br>  Both tools are designed to make it easy for newbies to see and implement recommendations for content optimization.  Follow the recommendations provided in the HTML Optimization section on an ongoing basis. <br><br>  In the case of new published content, be sure to check the correctness of the structured data - this is what allows your content to have approximately the following look in search engines: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/32e/bce/324/32ebce3245ad62679e66386cd3dee876.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Notice which of these results immediately catches the eye.  This can be a great competitive advantage.  Such a seemingly simple thing is still neglected - use it!  In particular, be sure to use bread crumbs and rating.  Read more about special markup here. <br><br>  If you are not a professional SEO specialist and publish articles on a wordpress blog, the Yoast plugin will be your indispensable assistant when publishing new content - it is extremely simple in work and will allow you to correct all important SEO moments during the publication of an article. <br><br><h4>  What's next? </h4><br><br>  <i><b>Julia Ramyalg, Internet marketer, co-owner of the web-studio MySite.ua:</b></i> <br><br>  Simply creating content better than that of competitors is a costly and resource-intensive task.  It is necessary to set the goal for which the content is created: to bring a certain group of search queries to the TOP, to raise traffic in a certain segment of the semantic core of the site, to improve behavioral and image factors. <br><br>  I view content closely with SEO, pinning my hopes on long-tailed traffic.  It is necessary to analyze what is in the TOP on this topic, how the search engines react to it.  It is necessary to do better on technical optimization (metatags, headers, formatting, image optimization, video), and on the semantic one. <br><br>  Why create the 11th article, similar to the ten already existing in the TOP?  It is necessary to capture related topics, i.e.  expand content  Or deepen it, giving more specifics and expert data. <br><br>  Do not be afraid to give in the article a little more than competitors give.  Do not be afraid that competitors will learn some secrets from your article and will bypass you.  Millions speak Russian, and only Tolstoy wrote War and Peace. <br><h4>  More is better? </h4><br><br>  <b><i>Vitaly Kravchenko, head of the agency Webline Promotion:</i></b> <br><br>  Over the past year, we have actively begun to use visualization and replace long offers of competitors with light and clear graphics.  We have changed the density of keywords, we lost some occurrences with a ‚Äúlong tail‚Äù in order not to lose the quality of the text in terms of perception, but positions improved and the page conversion increased. <br><br>  At the moment we are just looking at what and how competitors from TOP are writing, and we are trying to give more information with less cost to the client‚Äôs perception - it works.  It is quite expected the overflow of copywriters in the cost of "per page", and not for a sign or a half-sign.  Longrida stop working the way they used to. <br><br>  I attach a screenshot of the current update of the site, after the reduction of the text. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/19d/c33/802/19dc33802c8f7afc5c59f3ea6d3d34a2.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i><b>Nikita Semenov, General Director of SECL Group Ukraine:</b></i> <br><br>  ‚ÄúDeeper‚Äù often means ‚Äúlonger article‚Äù.  If there are facts that competitors do not have on the pages in the TOP, then it is worth mentioning them.  So it was with all my sites that I promoted.  In particular, with blogs moy.bike, prouaz.com and fresh - on legal topics.  We have changed and added many texts.  After which the position crawled up.  Content still plays a leading role in the promotion. <br><br><h4>  Summary </h4><br><br><ul><li>  Competitor analysis is a time consuming and expensive process, so it‚Äôs worthwhile to start it only by setting specific goals.  What information do you want to receive?  What are you planning to do with it? </li><li>  Who are we analyzing?  Who are your real competitors?  They are not necessarily in the TOP-10 issue. </li><li>  The information received and the action plan emerging from it: are they related to the realization of your main goals: sales, conversions, visits? </li><li>  How much will the implementation of the action plan cost, and what effect will it bring? </li><li>  What can be done more, better, fuller, cooler and more productive than competitors already do? </li></ul><br><br><h4>  Competition with yourself </h4><br><br>  The leitmotif of the comments of all experts is a recommendation not only to compete with colleagues in the market, but to grow above oneself, constantly evolving, improving compared to the previous reporting period.  And, of course, not limited to the bar taken by others, but set your own, more ambitious goals. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/298154/">https://habr.com/ru/post/298154/</a></p>
