However, with this step, he threatens the existence of <a href="http://www.quora.com/">Quora's</a> current Q &amp; A site, which was called the most discussed and expected Silicon Valley start-up. <br><br>  The delicacy of the situation is that Quora is a project, one of the two founders of which is a close friend and former partner of Mark - Adam D'Angelo.  The very same Adam with whom they entered Exeter.  Adam, with whom Mark created the first successful Pandora application.  The man who stood at the origins of Facebook, like Mark himself. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  When a sophomore at Harvard Zuckerberg decided to launch then theFacebook.com at the request of the university, to whom did he go?  To Adam.  Went for advice on an instant messaging system, and came up with ideas for the future of Facebook, which, by and large, Adam suggested. <br><br>  When Mark finished theFacebook.com, he quickly began to gain popularity.  At that time, he and D'Angelo lived under the same roof in Palo Alto, and he eventually became an employee of Facebook, receiving a bunch of shares and then taking the position of technical director.  And then he left.  And back.  So, FBML is the first language for the Facebook platform, it developed.

      Now they are competitors (if you can call a multibillion-dollar company with a staff of 1,600 employees, and yesterday's startup, which now employs eight people).  But this is business.  Both are tremendously aware of trends, and Mark is uncompromising in his leadership.  No wonder that big fishes eat small fishes, but to be honest, they don‚Äôt really believe that Tsuk decided to just take revenge on his two former colleagues. <br><br>  This confirms Blake Ross (Blake Ross) - the person who took part in the creation of Firefox, and now the Director of Product on Facebook, hand in hand, says that he would never kill someone else's brainchild, on the contrary - he is in favor of startups appeared and grew, especially since he himself was among the first users of Quora.  And how he is friends with the Quora team and wishes them every success - a lovely sight. <br><br>  However, Quora service is anonymous, which allows you to read some very interesting and bold remarks, for example, <a href="http://www.quora.com/Why-is-Facebook-creating-a-Q-A-product-to-compete-against-Quora/answers/37030">such</a> : <br>  <i>Yes, the Facebook Q &amp; A project is just a fact that Tsuk shows former employees, as well as a consequence of Ross‚Äôs sluggish policy.</i>  <i>Blake loves to create hype, trite copying projects.</i>  <i>Moreover, Q &amp; A is not a priority service, and people were put to work with it on the leftover principle of those who are not involved in priority projects.</i>  <i>This is just a clone of Quora and many Facebook employees made a reservation a couple of times calling their project by that name.</i> <br><br>  At the same time, Quora was under the boot of Facebook.  As Chris Hughes writes in the book The Facebook Effect: ‚ÄúWorking with Mark is a challenge.  You will never know whether he likes what you do or not.  It is much better to be friends with him than to work. ‚Äù <br><br>  via <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/ims-reveal-facebook-versus-quora-is-a-battle-between-best-friends-2010-6">businessinsider.com</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/97355/">https://habr.com/ru/post/97355/</a></p>
