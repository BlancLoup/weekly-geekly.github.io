Botalution of humanity</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <strong>This is my first habratopic, so please do not judge strictly and do not minus too much.</strong> <br><br>  I look at and read Habr for a long time, now there was a desire to start writing here. <br><br>  Every day the Internet is becoming more and more complicated, growing.  And naturally, humanity, as always, seeks to simplify it, to automate it.  It is because of this desire in the network appeared bots.  Currently, a large amount of negative information is associated with bots on the network.  Mailing spam, viruses, spam on the forums.  They are struggling with them, but they continue to improve, bypassing the most skillful defenses.

      But at the same time there are <strong>useful bots</strong> , such as search engines.  They help people learn about new and interesting things online. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  But humanity does not stand still, and our eternal <strong>desire to simplify the world</strong> leads only to its complication.  And then we are trying to simplify what is complicated and it turns out only a spiral, where we constantly rise up or down - it depends on the point of view of the individual. <br><br>  I personally think that now we live in the beginning of the <strong>heyday of the era of web2.0</strong> <br>  I read very little about semantics and stuff, but I remember reading a magazine at school where Tim Berners Lee talked about smart search. <br><br>  Simplifying the search by creating search smart bots with unique individual settings * for you *, when the bot understands that you need to find information about your favorite group Cockroaches, and not about a group of animals Cockroaches for example, of course, this has already been said.  But I am talking about <strong>dynamics</strong> . <br>  Bots are already writing on the forums.  Unconsciously, as children who draw in the list what the teachers told them.  Flood and spam ... <br><br>  But every day there is more and more information on the network and its search <strong>becomes</strong> much <strong>more complicated</strong> ... <br>  Then the children will go to another class.  And they will begin to actively correspond with other children.  By asking your personal search bot a task you don‚Äôt specify where to go?  It decides according to the settings algorithm.  He will be able to communicate with other bots, because someone could already ask the bot to collect such information.  This may be the bot of your colleague, or friend, or maybe the bot of some community that knows more and <strong>more difficult to set up</strong> . <br>  The bot will quietly walk for you to the online store, because he will know better how you eat better and what to wear.  After all, your computer will have all your bio data.  Information will be collected by a bot from policlinic servers, where it will be allowed access to your analyzes, your work, information will be collected there, how often you are late, what you eat, where you sit, on your blog, how often you write about what.  You yourself will open access to your personal bot there. <br>  When you have children, the bot will be able to assist <strong>in their training and monitor their</strong> proper development, to train. <br><br>  The explosion of Tamagotchi‚Äôs popularity has passed, but nevertheless it showed that people can coexist with virtual creatures, and a wave of suicides and nervous breakdowns at the death of pets showed a level of emotional affection. <br><br>  Already during this period, you will be able to conduct an active discussion and discuss with your bots your family, friends, and the community many interesting things to you.  After all, the bot is smarter and more educated than you. <br>  Then people recognize bots as a form of life, because they are developing, they are learning, well, why aren't people? <br>  Algorithms?  So what, a person also has reflex algorithms. <br>  Then bots will be given civil rights. <br><br>  Since bots understand human best of all, it is possible that <strong>marriages with bots</strong> will be allowed.  Naturally, at the same time it will be regulated, at what <strong>amount of wearable unique information and algorithms a</strong> bot is considered to be <strong>* independent *</strong> .  That is something like a certificate of maturity, the majority for the bot.  Do not forget that technology continues to evolve and modern bots will also be far from the bots of this era, as we are far from amoeba and multicellular. <br><br>  Bots-teachers, bots-doctors, bots-soldiers.  Yes, it is Artificial Intelligence.  Here it is in all its beauty, imperceptibly entered into your life.  They are the best consultants, the best teachers.  Relatively impartial (until they get sick with any virus).  But the more the Network develops, the more they will become diverse and unique. <br>  In the end, the law of equalization of civil rights is likely to be passed. <br><br>  What will happen next?  It is hard to say.  Perhaps * they lived happily ever after *.  Perhaps a war of people and bots with complete destruction: <br>  1) people <br>  2) bots and networks <br>  3) people, bots, web and everything else <br>  4) peaceful existence where people gradually lose their dominant role <br>  5) Qualitative leap of the mind of people (I do not know what it is - Telepathy, paranormality, etc.) <br><br>  Maybe this is the evolution of people?  The main problem is that bots will be faster learning and more manageable than humans.  And they will be able to overtake people by these parameters. <br><br>  It all started with the fact that some monkey wanted a banana and she picked up a stick ... This is such a smart stick ... <br>  Naturally, these are all my fantasies.  But who believed in the tales of <strong>Jules Verne</strong> ? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/11004/">https://habr.com/ru/post/11004/</a></p>
