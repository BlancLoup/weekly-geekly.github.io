While the idea was finally formed in my head and I was about to splash it into the bowels of the boomstarter, a similar project started on the more well-known site kickstarter.  If it did not disappoint you, please under the cat ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The article will go copy-paste with boomstarter, so who is too lazy to poke at the link below. <br>  ‚ÄúEvery person is talented in his own way.  Regardless of age, religion, financial status and many other factors, we are all creative people.  Expand your opportunities with us! ‚Äù  These lines somehow themselves laid down "on paper" and as I did not re-read them, it was decided to leave that way.

      <b>Project Goals</b> <br><br>  Some realize their creativity in work, others in the hobby.  Your attention is invited to a device that helps not only develop creativity, but also to become your assistant in the implementation of their projects based on programmable controllers.  The goal of this project is to create an electronic ‚Äúdesigner‚Äù module, which can be used both as an integral part of a large project and as a complete device.  This project is only the first step in the development of a line of commercially available devices of various configurations and purposes.  It is important for us to find like-minded project, those who truly imbued with the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating a product.  By following each other and in step, we can succeed!  By financing this startup you will not only be able to try your hand at mastering the art of programming, but also give impetus to those who lack only a little for the first step in implementing their project! <br><br>  <b>Application</b> <br><br>  There are dozens of different Batl applications.  I will give a few, the most common: <br><br>  1. Education.  Programming and circuitry are key points that help a person to develop (this is especially applicable to children of preschool and school age, when their brain absorbs new information like a sponge). <br><br>  2. Design.  Batl can act as a software and hardware debugging platform.  Choose the development environment closest to you, from several suggested ones, optimize it for yourself and start working! <br><br>  3. Robotics.  The interest of creating something ‚Äúreasonable‚Äù with your own hands is always high.  Immersed in the development of your robot, you can not only create a device of your dreams, but also feel the charm of the possibility of "revitalizing" inanimate objects. <br><br>  4. Automation.  Designing automation devices for use in the systems "Smart Home", "Alarm and Alert", "Leakage Control", etc ... Make your home safer and more economical. <br><br>  <i>And also:</i> one Batl module acts as the ‚Äúheart‚Äù of your project, let it be a robot, a smart home system, a data acquisition and processing controller, an electronic lighting and ventilation control system, a programming learning system, or any other device.  With Batl, most of your fantasies can become reality. <br><br>  <b>The target audience</b> <br><br>  Diverse.  Batl is a device with almost no restrictions on age, sex and level of education.  It's never too late to implement your project or just start exploring something new. <br><br>  <b>Difference from existing projects</b> <br><br>  1. Customization.  Batl has an intuitive hardware interface that does not need to be configured and starts working immediately after connecting to a PC.  Even a beginner will appreciate the ease of communication with the module. <br><br>  2. Pricing policy.  Even the first batch of devices will be competitive in cost and performance compared to other similar projects.  Subsequently, it is planned to adjust the price based on the increase in the number of devices in the party. <br><br>  3. Accessibility.  Controllers (STM32) over the past year have gained a large number of developers.  STMicroelectronics provides first-class support - this is one of the key points in the development of electronics. <br>  4. Main features of Batl S <br>  Core: ARM Cortex-M3, 32-bit; <br>  Flash memory: 64 KB; <br>  RAM-memory: 7,875 KB; <br>  Core / peripheral supply voltage: 2-3,6V; <br>  Interfaces for connecting to a PC: miniUSB; <br>  Additional programming interface: SWD; <br>  Number of ports: 25; <br>  Management: boot and reset buttons; <br>  LED indication: power and controlled output (PC13). <br><br>  5. Sizes Batl S. One of the most obvious advantages is the miniature size of the module, which is especially important for embedded systems.  The dimensions of the board are only 18.5x43 mm, and the possibilities enclosed in it are enormous. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4f0/2e1/94d/4f02e194d35e8db39143bb5ee4f9b29b.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Implementation</b> <br><br>  The project will be implemented in four main stages. <br><br>  1. Design.  Cosmetic changes in the Batl S board (STM32F100C8T6B).  Designing the next in the line Batl M (STM32F100RBT6).  To facilitate the debugging of software, a programmer will be built into this version in order to be able to integrate with the programming environment (for example, IAR). <br><br>  2. Order 10 samples and running test software on them.  Completion of the hardware.  Writing documentation. <br><br>  3. Order the first batch of devices 100pcs.  Elaboration of the concept of expansion cards for the project. <br><br>  4. Encouragement of persons actively involved in promoting the project.  Preparation of booklets and instructions.  Finalization of the site. <br><br>  <i>Pending Goals:</i> <br><br>  After collecting 300000r there is a possibility of further assistance to the project, each subsequent collected 100000r will go to the implementation of the next stage: <br>  1. Study of the site and the organization of the possibility of pre-orders for devices.  Writing detailed technical documentation.  Creating a learning room with several lessons for quick mastering of Batl. <br><br>  2. Creation of the first expansion modules for the Batl board.  The site will contain a voting form that will help you choose the most popular modules (breadboard expansion card, real-time clock, sensor modules, screen module, relay switch card, RF modules for different frequencies, etc.).  There will also be an opportunity to offer their options. <br><br>  3. Development, production and testing of three modules from the line.  After successful completion of testing, the modules will immediately go on sale.  New features - new ideas! <br><br>  4. Creation of equipment for quick testing of assembled printed circuit boards, which at the same time can be used as an expansion card for Batl modules.  Additional connectors, ‚Äúsuspenders‚Äù, LEDs and much more will help to achieve the goal even faster without spending additional time and resources.  We will do everything for you!  You only need one thing: a creative approach to solving the problem! <br><br>  5. Development of the product case.  In addition to embedding the Batl module into ready-made systems (switches, sockets, electrical equipment cases, etc.), you can give your devices a complete look.  We have the opportunity to create several body designs, creating samples (printing on a 3D printer).  After the end of the stage, anyone can download a 3D model of the case from the site and print it. <br><br>  At each new stage we will try to do everything to reduce the cost, and therefore the final cost of the Batl modules, without deteriorating, at the same time, the quality of workmanship. <br><br>  <b>Future plans</b> <br><br>  After the launch of the first batch of devices, it is planned to refine the hardware of the device taking into account possible comments arising in the process of familiarizing users with the platform.  Next, create a line of devices on different controllers (from the ST line) and with different functionality. <br><br>  The first Batl XS board in the line will have an incredibly low cost and is designed on an STM32F100C4T6B chip (dimensions will also be reduced). <br><br>  Batl XXL will be with a wide range of interfaces on a high-performance chip.  To develop this module, a survey will be conducted among users to settle technical requirements.  Each developer will have the opportunity to contribute to the project.  We believe in your experience and hope to cooperate! <br><br>  In total, the line will feature six devices with extensions.  I want to note that the extensions will be cross-platform. <br><br>  <b>Parting words</b> <br><br>  Let your dreams take you!  Materialize your ideas!  Having started your study of microcontrollers from exploring the module Batl S you will not start from scratch! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/219263/">https://habr.com/ru/post/219263/</a></p>
