I see it like this: <br><br>  <b>The student</b> is, of course, a ‚Äúperson‚Äù, whose rights must respect everything, but for some reason do not respect it.  He believes that everyone owes him, and he owes nothing to anyone.  He also believes that all <b>teachers</b> are as stupid as Americans, and they are looking at <b>graduate students</b> as crazy idiots.  It should also be noted that a <b>good student</b> is a person who understands why he came to the university and does not understand at all what <b>students</b> are doing here.  <b>A naive student</b> is usually a <b>good student</b> who is waiting for him to start teaching at a university and, without waiting, becomes a <b>working student</b> who is even worse than a <b>student</b> .

      <b>Graduate student</b> - a former <b>good student</b> or <b>teacher's</b> son / daughter.  <b>They</b> become a <b>graduate student</b> for several reasons: 1) he does not want to join the army 2) he has no job 3) he (and as a rule, she) likes the education system 4) he (she) wants to prove himself in science 5) he (she) graduate student in the fourth (fifth) knee. <br><br>  <b>The teacher</b> is a <b>good graduate student</b> who defended himself and decided to teach at the university. <br><br>  As you can see, the farther into the forest, the less options.  Under the cut the text is more serious. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Why do I need it? </h4><br>  Everyone decides for himself why he needs to go to graduate school and become a teacher.  Very rarely, this love of science (unfortunately), as a rule, the reasons are simpler - the opportunity to work only at the university, family tradition, the army, etc.  I will not dig deeper, the truth still everyone has their own. <br><br><h4>  Graduate student, who are you? </h4><br>  You should understand that a graduate student is not a teacher, because: <ul><li>  A graduate student must pass exams - from Candminimums to local verification. </li><li>  graduate student is dependent on many factors - scientific.  head, bureaucratic education system, rector, etc. </li><li>  graduate student has no right to lecture, but only practice and laboratory (although in life everything is different) </li></ul>  But a graduate student must report 100 hours a year.  Therefore, he and the teacher too.  The first dilemma, which I meet constantly: ‚Äúsorry, I could not pick up the phone, I was on pairs‚Äù.  The interlocutor thinks that there is a student in front of him, and he is unlikely to guess that there is a graduate student reading pairs in front of him.  If you say that you are a teacher, it will mean that you are a little cunning. <br><br><h4>  How to behave? </h4><br>  I had a whole break-up before my first official occupation as a graduate student teacher.  What is the second dilemma: how to behave - put everyone in place, play ‚Äúfashionable‚Äù, play ‚Äúone's own‚Äù, or show ‚Äúwho is the master of science in the temple‚Äù from day one.  After all, you can not behave as a full-fledged teacher, but as a student you can no longer behave.  Dilemma? <br><br><h4>  Science vs Work </h4><br>  This is not just a dilemma, but just the same dilemma !!!  At a time when your childhood friend goes to the X5, you are learning the fifth way to solve a transportation problem or a traveling salesman problem.  For many, this is not acceptable.  I want to say from myself that it is quite possible to combine, but (I think) for the time being. <br><br>  In the process of study (work?) In graduate school the following points are reached: <ul><li>  not all teachers are bad </li><li>  not all teachers are good too </li><li>  who should be considered a good teacher ‚Äî one who gave a good grade, one who lectures well or one who knows a lot?  As for me, one can be considered a good person who has been able to <i>convince</i> students to walk, teach and respect your subject.  Remark: it does not depend on the subject. </li><li>  important: the teacher, in addition to his pedagogical work, also needs to do a bunch of things - from drawing up schedules to writing a heap of waste paper - and all this in a short time "as of yesterday" </li><li>  It‚Äôs not always the teacher‚Äôs fault that it‚Äôs bad ‚Äî to replace Pascal with C # and Java, you need to get a bunch of permissions, redo many plans, write manuals, go through scientific advice and only then, maybe, you will be allowed to read the new language.  It is clear that not everyone will go to such heroic acts, no matter how good a teacher he is </li><li>  bureaucracy in universities has not been canceled </li></ul>  After real life in the role of a student, views on life change dramatically. <br><br>  And finally, a few pearls from student life: <br><br><h4>  Study 1 </h4><br>  We test knowledge goes for several systems: <ul><li>  5th - familiar to most </li><li>  12-point - already familiar too, but more recently replaced by 5th </li><li>  Bologna (letter) - A, B, etc. </li><li>  modular-rated - points for each item.  what is calculated on the basis of loans - one course, as a rule, is one loan.  Later was replaced by a credit-modular </li><li>  sign in magazines of all stripes and instances </li></ul>  It turns out that the teacher must give each student up to 4 different digits and letters for one subject.  We multiply the number of students by the number of subjects and the number of assessments and add journals and reports here, and we understand that the teacher‚Äôs headache at the session hurts more than the students. <br><br>  By the way, I decipher the concept of "credit-modular system" as "you take a loan - you hand over a module" :) <br><br><h4>  Study 2 </h4><br>  They come to take the laboratory in columns 3 students.  The first piece is the title, the second is the task and the program in C # (it is not taught in our department).  I open the third sheet - there is a screenshot of the results of the program, on which the inscription "Turbo Pascal version ..." stands out !!!  As they say, no comment ... <br><br><h4>  Study 3 </h4><br>  Once, one teacher told us one phrase: ‚ÄúNo one will reproach me for not teaching you, but I will surely be reproached for not writing the right amount of articles in a year.‚Äù  This is not us, this is life like this ... <br><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4><br>  For myself, I made it in the following wording: ‚ÄúWhoever you are, a student or a teacher, you need to be, first and foremost, a person.‚Äù <br><br>  PS I just came from the university where I was supposed to give a lecture, but the students did not come.  This article was born in the time saved :) Thank you for your attention. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/77630/">https://habr.com/ru/post/77630/</a></p>
