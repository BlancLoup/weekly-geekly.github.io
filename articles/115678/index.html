    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>Criteria</b> <br>  We will immediately agree: do not spend more than 16,000 rubles - self-indulgence!  And choose only those that are sold on the territory of Russia, and they can really be found on the shelves, and not to look for the remains of one or two stores.  Now that generally consider tablets: let it have a diagonal of at least 7 inches!  Sly marketers can dance around the microscopic crafts of their companies as long as they like, but they will not be more comfortable using such devices.  It is better to buy a smartphone.  We also exclude the younger Android: in 2011, you can only trade crafts on Android 1.5 or 1.6 on the territory of the archaeological museum.  Also, there was almost no place in the charts for the ‚Äútablets‚Äù on Windows 7, but for a different reason: today, for 16,000 rubles, nothing interesting can be found on this system on board. <br><br>  <b>Qugo WinPad 10</b> <br>  Price: 16000 rubles <br><br>  Qugo WinPad 10 turned out to be very close to these criteria, although it is literally on the price line, but it has a good screen and really good hardware stuffing ...  for the netbook.  No, really, carry a kilogram ‚Äúlaptop without a keyboard‚Äù with a frail battery and an operating system that is not very suitable for working with your fingers without any cosmetic improvements?  Not the ultimate dream. <br><br>  Verdict: for that kind of money, I would buy myself a good netbook with a display diagonal of 10-12 inches and did not even remember about tablet solutions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2f2/e4e/904/2f2e4e904932ae2fca46c69b2cfe0261.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Pocketbook IQ 701</b> <br>  Price: 8000 rubles <br><br>  And here is the most controversial device.  Representatives of the company emphasize: this is an electronic reader, not a tablet.  And indeed, the functions of the tablet in the device are trimmed.  There is no access to the Android Market, the hardware stuffing is almost an exact copy of an old Samsung Spica, and a nonstandard display resolution can cause a conflict with some of the applications.  But in the future firmware of the device, the text sounding function <s>may</s> appear, fast access to the Bookland online store is already preinstalled (an attempt to create an ecosystem is included), and 500 works of classics of literature are loaded into the memory of the gadget.  Plus, a solid build, albeit a bit heavy. <br><br>  Verdict: For fans of reading from LCD displays, this is one of the most functional readers on the market with a very reasonable price.  As a tablet it is not worth buying. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/041/75e/dd3/04175edd359b679dff89dbccb246a7f4.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>RoverPad 3W T70</b> <br>  Price: 7000 rubles <br><br>  The most typical representative of the tablets of this weight category: 7-inch resistive screen with a resolution of 800x480 pixels, weak iron and stuck on the 2.1 version of Android.  Of the interesting solutions - just two microUSB connectors.  From complaints - big problems with connecting an external 3G-modem. <br><br>  Verdict: I would not buy such a device even for such a modest amount. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0e8/a9d/f0b/0e8a9df0bbd8aa3376a6e6f5ebbb70df.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>teXet TM-7010</b> <br>  Price: 8,000 rubles. <br><br>  The recently released teXet tablet is even inferior in hardware to the RoverPad 3W T70, but the developers didn‚Äôt stint on the battery: 4000 mAh! <br><br>  Verdict: As a "reader" or photo frame - a good gadget.  As a tablet - I beg you! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d86/426/ba2/d86426ba221b72e82da2bf23a813722e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Oysters T7 Al and Qumo GO!</b> <br>  Price: 7500-8000 rubles <br><br>  This couple is interesting due to the use of a more efficient processor (in Oysters T7 Al, it is also overclocked to 800 MHz).  Judging by the numerous reviews, these gadgets with support for external 3G-modems have full order, and there are significantly fewer slowdowns in their work.  The capacity of the built-in drives is 8 GB, which is also very good.  The screen is the same - 7 inches, resistive, 800x480 pixels.  But for such a sum, nothing else shines for us. <br><br>  Verdict: If money is just enough, and the tablet wants, it makes sense to look at Oysters T7 Al. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d40/69b/7d3/d4069b7d336350f0fd24f45891e2222b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Oysters T10 SL</b> <br>  Price: 12000 rubles <br><br>  Step not only in the direction of increasing the price tag, but also in the direction of improving the characteristics of the gadget.  The screen is still resistive, but the diagonal is many - 10 inches, and the resolution is 1024x600 pixels.  The gigahertz processor and the really capacious battery also belong to the indisputable advantages of the device.  However, this model is associated with a lot of angry responses to the work of the speakers, firmware glitches and various minor flaws. <br><br>  Verdict: If the task is to buy a tablet with the largest screen for the smallest amount, this is an option.  But it‚Äôs not the diagonal that colors the tablet ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6cc/7f7/0f6/6cc7f70f629668df86f0a7168a557e95.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Beeline M2</b> <br>  Price: 13,000 rubles <br><br>  The first tablet from the list, which is not terrible to go out.  In addition to Wi-Fi, it supports work in the networks of the second and third generation, as a bonus, when buying Beeline, it gives 300 MB of traffic.  Here's another chip - if you wish, you can unlock the tablet from the Beeline card.  The 7-inch display of the device, although made by resistive technology, is distinguished by high sensitivity.  A bundle of Qualcomm MSM7227 600 MHz processor and 512 MB of RAM will give the gadget a performance of the LG Optimus One level, which allows us to speak about relatively fast work.  Also on board there was a place for the GPS satellite communication module.  But movies in HD and Full HD resolution on it is normal not to watch.  Brake. <br><br>  Verdict: As a device for traveling on the web and simple entertainment Beeline M2 is quite suitable.  But a little more ‚Äúmultimedia‚Äù would not hurt him. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5c9/239/d91/5c9239d91f5e899b846bf27ca588cd9d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Huawei Ideos Tablet S7 (MTS version)</b> <br>  Price: 13600 rubles <br><br>  The communication capabilities of the Huawei Ideos Tablet S7 are not different from the Beeline M2, but its 7-inch display is made with capacitive technology and supports multi-touch, which means the tablet is much more interesting in terms of games and other fun.  What contributes to the applied processor - Qualcomm Snapdragon QSD8250 with a frequency of 1 GHz.  It is important to remember that the various modifications of this tablet a lot.  And such ‚Äúiron‚Äù goodness is only in the version that MTS sells.  The gadget also got a GPS module and supports the DLNA data transfer standard.  It is a pity, but it does not have its own built-in storage device - only 150 MB for installing applications and a slot for a memory card. <br><br>  Verdict: if the tablet needs not only the Internet, but also a variety of entertainment, this is a good, balanced option. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ac7/dd0/acd/ac7dd0acd7c083379229ae5c20f7ad3e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Archos 101 8GB and Prestigio MultiPad 7100C</b> <br>  Price: 14000-15000 rubles <br><br>  The already sold Archos 101 8 GB and the only Prestigio MultiPad 7100C entering the market are very interesting and versatile solutions.  Their capacitive displays have a diagonal of 10.1 inches, the resolution is 1024x600 pixels, and the processor clock frequency is 1 GHz.  Although the RAM is only 256 MB, Android 2.2.  not nearly as voracious as 2.1, and there should not be any particular shortage.  Adobe Flash is supported, there are satellite communication modules, you can connect external modems.  Despite its high price (there is no money left even for a small bag), these are really interesting things that can deliver quite a few pleasant minutes.  However, it was not without surprises.  Both gadgets by default do not have access to the Android Market.  And if in the case of the Archos the situation can still be corrected by talking with the owners on the forums, Prestigio remains a ‚Äúdark horse‚Äù in this (and many other) relationships. <br><br>  Verdict: Archos 101 8 GB - you can take.  As for the Prestigio MultiPad 7100C, I would wait a little with its purchase.  You never know what other surprises can "emerge"? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/95a/af7/556/95aaf7556c9dc0466beafe3d4778f3cf.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Apple iPad 16 GB</b> <br>  Price: 15000 rubles <br><br>  The recent announcement of the Apple iPad 2 presented a unique opportunity to join the fruit gadgets, without going beyond the amount we set.  Of course, for a novelty, and even in Russia, our budget is definitely not enough.  But the cheapest of the versions of the first generation in a month or two just fall to this level.  The Apple iPad stands out with an excellent high-resolution touchscreen, powerful hardware stuffing, a robust battery, a well-designed ecosystem and manufacturer support.  Which will certainly update the firmware for its brainchild more often than most of the companies that produce "GooglePlanets".  But Flash will have to be forgotten, and the iPad aspect ratio would do honor to an electronic reader rather than a tablet computer.  And more insidious iTunes will control the transfer of multimedia files.  But, nevertheless, this is the best of what may appear in stores in the near future at such a price. <br><br>  Verdict: you have to wait a couple of months and shovel a bunch of offers from various stores, but it's worth it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/01a/d26/883/01ad2688307ab72f044c902cda60d583.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Everything turned out to be very predictable: the more money to invest in the purchase of a tablet, the better product you can buy.  Of course, the entire fifty sold in the market "pills" in this top does not fit.  But, having become acquainted with the most massive and prominent representatives of this crowd, you can easily deal with those devices that have passed our attention.  And now, to consolidate the results - the final table!  Summary <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5c3/513/284/5c3513284963489b213892625757a976.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Comparative characteristics of all participants in the charts.
