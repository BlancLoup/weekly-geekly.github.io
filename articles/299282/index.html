But I found two films that would be useful to watch not only alone, but also with your subordinates.  And now I will explain why. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Motivation</b> <br><br>  A long time ago, in the late 90s, one intelligent person expressed to me the opinion that the main problems of our people are that no one has a goal.  No one understands what he wants to achieve and what to do for that.

      Now, a decade and a half later, not much better.  The obese 2000s brought people faith in a calm and full life, but did not give the necessary message to work hard and hard. <br>  If earlier, many believed that it would not be better, you can not try, but now these people believe that everything will become good by itself, you can and not strain. <br><blockquote>  I have been doing quite a lot of interviews lately and periodically two categories of candidates come to me. </blockquote><br>  The first go with the flow.  To the question ‚ÄúWhy did you not work for half a year?‚Äù, Such: ‚ÄúThere was money in general, I did not see the need‚Äù.  Their dream is a warm place where they can sit their pants for a salary. <br><br>  The latter are energetic, but this energy is mainly aimed at increasing personal well-being.  When I asked such a (very average level of qualification) candidate, what level of remuneration he expects, I heard ‚ÄúYou have crazy salaries in Moscow, so no less than 100,000‚Äù.  ‚ÄúWhy didn't you learn programming in the last work, did you offer it for free?‚Äù I asked. <br>  "And what a fool I am, until 9 every day to stay!"  They wanted me to spend my personal time on it! ‚ÄùHe replied. <br><blockquote>  But the worst thing is that quite hard-working and motivated employees can eventually slide to the state of two previously considered characters. </blockquote><br>  And to prevent this from happening, sit down with the whole company and show them the film ‚ÄúThe Wolf of Wall Street.‚Äù  You can not even the whole movie, but only this fragment: <br><br> <a href="https://youtu.be/qE4GuEqFaDA%3Ft%3D1m"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ac1/ada/f0e/ac1adaf0ecfb43a6933d8fdc55812707.jpg"></a> <br>  <i>Click to view</i> <br><br>  And then discuss.  If they didn‚Äôt get it, if they didn‚Äôt want to pick up the phone right now and call the customer, then it is quite possible that these are the wrong people for you. <br>  Perhaps they want to sit out a crisis (or life) in a warm nest, making a minimum of movements.  Or get everything ready, without effort. <br><br>  And you may need to upgrade your team. <br><br>  <b>Sales passion</b> <br><br>  Sales managers, alas, are not considered the business elite.  Some consider it a boring craft, others unworthy of their ‚Äúgreat‚Äù purpose. <br><blockquote>  As a result, those who could not find themselves in other areas often become sellers.  Or hopes that this occupation is temporary. </blockquote><br>  The fact is that sellers are needed even in difficult times, so numerous marketers, hr-s, designers and others want to outweigh the sales crisis. <br>  Since this is a temporary occupation for them, they are not going to develop, grow and improve their qualifications.  So you should not expect high results. <br><br>  If (so it happened) there are a lot of such ‚Äúimmigrants‚Äù in your team, show them the film ‚ÄúThe Jones Family‚Äù.  Let them see that the sales process is a complex and interesting thing. <br><br> <a href="https://youtu.be/GeIeEXvs_Lw%3Ft%3D17m20s"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/240/881/81a/24088181ac514ec2b661b6a4430386c9.jpg"></a> <br>  <i>Click to view</i> <br><blockquote>  The film clearly shows the principle - <b>if you don‚Äôt believe, you don‚Äôt sell it</b> .  Until the seller himself truly considers his product to be the best, believing that it is impossible to do without him and he will bring happiness to the customer - sales will remain sluggish and mourn over the phone, ‚ÄúTell me, have you already watched our system? ...‚Äù <br></blockquote><br>  In general, see only the right movie. <br>  And good luck to your business! <br><br>  Andrey Ignatov </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/299282/">https://habr.com/ru/post/299282/</a></p>
