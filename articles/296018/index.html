  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Why Facebook artificial intelligence</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Every year your news feed on Facebook becomes one and a half times longer, and time does not increase in days.  Therefore, the social network is trying to configure the issuance of news so that you receive only interesting and necessary messages.  Since 2010, Facebook has been giving the tape incompletely, ranking users' records according to unknown parameters.  Now the network is working on artificial intelligence that can recognize both text and its meaning, as well as objects and people in photographs.  Facebook is trying to become more interesting for all users and more accessible for people with disabilities. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/245/1f8/603/2451f8603a9d601e9c3a54c270d688f6.png" width="600" alt="image"><br>  <i>Using these photos, Facebook developers are teaching the system to recognize the breed of dogs.</i> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Artificial Intelligence </h4><br>  Facebook Vice President Mike Shrepfer <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-outlines-its-artificial-and-machine-learning-ambitions-2015-11">spoke at the Dublin Wet Summit</a> on Tuesday morning November 3, 2015.  Mike spoke about the urgent need for Facebook to create a system that can understand the world and better filter it.  Therefore, the company has assembled a team of FAIR - Facebook Artificial Intelligence Team.  Developers teach the system to understand the world like people, through language, images, planning, and predictions. <br><br>  Facebook has long been finding faces in photos, but the team taught the computer to recognize other objects in the photos and give them names.  Next week, Facebook wants to talk about how developers have learned to segment images 30 percent faster, using less training data than was needed before.

      Now the artificial intelligence system can determine the breed of the dog in the image.  To do this, the system was trained using photos of dogs.  Facebook will be able to use this ‚Äúskill‚Äù of artificial intelligence to customize news feeds, to help people with disabilities, and to improve their own voice assistant M, rival Siri and Google Now. <br><br><h4>  Intelligent news feed configuration </h4><br>  Every year your tape increases by 40-50%.  At the same time from 40% of the total time on Facebook you spend it in the tape.  Internet penetration is increasing, the number of users of social networks is increasing, you are adding new friends, and your new friends and pages are starting to write more and more.  But do you need all this information? <br><br>  Schrepfer explains that artificial intelligence capabilities will help users better configure the tape.  You just need to explain to the social network that you like photos of children, but do not like latte art. <br><br>  The second way to use this Facebook skill is to search for your photos with certain parameters: for example, you can find photos from holidays on the sea.  The third way concerns the processing of a photo: you can take a photo in black and white, leaving the fragment you want in color.  Facebook's visual skills will work along with speech recognition. <br><br><h4>  Expanding opportunities for people with disabilities </h4><br>  <a href="http://geektimes.ru/post/249248/">The blind</a> and <a href="http://geektimes.ru/post/249248/">deaf people</a> use the <a href="http://geektimes.ru/post/265080/">Braille</a> display to get information from the Internet, the blind use the same font or soundtrack, and the visually impaired use the sound due to enlarged fonts and special <br>  site interface.  Facebook plans to help the visually impaired and the blind with the help of artificial intelligence. <br><br>  Schrepfer said that the company is in the early stages of creating a product for 285 million people on the planet with visual limitations and 40 million blind people.  Facebook will help them communicate with the artificial intelligence system to enable them to find out what is depicted in the photos in their feed. <br><br><h4>  Assistant </h4><br>  In August 2015, several hundred people in San Francisco <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-08-26/facebook-tests-ai-based-digital-assistant-in-challenge-to-siri">began testing their personal digital assistant, M.</a>  He is a competitor to Siri and Google Now and works in the Facebook Messenger mobile app.  The above-mentioned activities of the company will help expand the capabilities of the "virtual assistant". <br><br>  M is now learning to communicate with real people.  When you ask for M help in buying flowers, he asks the questions ‚ÄúWhat is your budget?‚Äù And ‚ÄúTo whom do you want to send them?‚Äù For this, the system tracks the communication between living people. <br><br>  <b>PS</b> And by the way - the Facebook application for Android <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/android-app/369513256545845">doesn't record your conversations</a> .  If you turn on this option, the company, while writing your next status, will only try to analyze the audio environment and calculate what kind of music, or TV / radio program is currently playing. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/296018/">https://habr.com/ru/post/296018/</a></p>
