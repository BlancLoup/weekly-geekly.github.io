  <section class="page js-page"><h1>New Mail - Inbox from Google</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Last night (10.22.2014) Google announced the launch of a new service / project - <a href="http://inbox.google.com/">Inbox</a> .  So far, you can try only on invites and it is very limited (when Gmail was launched, they gave 50 invites each, now there was a maximum of 10, but they don‚Äôt give a new one at all).  Invites should appear tomorrow or next week.  Just want to note - <b>Gmail is not going anywhere,</b> and both projects will be developed in parallel.  So those who do not like the new Inbox - do not worry, you can work in the old Gmail interface. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d93/a9d/125/d93a9d125baa4f59a9b84dcfe80573fd.png" alt="Inbox application on Android" width="250"></div><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The Android application is fully implemented with the new concept of <b>material design</b> .  Very nice and comfortable.  There have already been many publications on this topic, so now about something else.  I would like to review a brief review using the example of a web interface, which is also designed in the material design style: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8d2/c46/131/8d2c46131c144e20b7b32e7e493d225d.png" alt="This is the web interface."></div>
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      In the upper left corner is already familiar menu for those who use Google+, for example.  There you can find - <b>Pending</b> , <b>Trash</b> , <b>Spam</b> , <b>Drafts</b> , all your labels and groups, etc. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7ed/3c6/c0a/7ed3c6c0a4d44eb1bd4d487aea5c1d9e.png" alt="Menu"></div><br><br>  Letters are broken up automatically into groups - <b>Forums</b> , <b>Travel</b> , <b>Finance</b> , <b>Alerts</b> , etc.  Enough logically and conveniently - statements from the bank - in Finance, plane tickets - in Traveling, alerts on personal messages, etc.  from social networks - in social networks, etc.  These groups are also combined by date - <b>Today</b> , <b>Yesterday</b> , <b>this month</b> and <b>monthly</b> previous ones.  On the right in the upper corner of each group there is a check mark that allows you to mark all the letters in the group at once as completed.  Oh yeah, about that ... <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d77/ecc/ff5/d77eccff521a4f2ba0568e2191986071.png" alt="Fixed ones do not disappear from the list and are always visible (if they are not executed)"></div><br><br>  The main difference between <b>Inbox</b> and <b>Gmail</b> is that letters represent a to-do list.  Yes, yes, something like that.  Therefore, there is no read, but there are <b>completed</b> .  It is understood that most of the letters that come to you, you need to somehow react - read, reply, forward, etc.  In fact, every letter is a kind of task that needs to be processed.  That is the logic.  And we must understand that in this case, the letters try not to delete (for someone it is a minus, but deleting with a single click in the Inbox will not work).  Letters mark completed.  In Gmail, an analog is an archive.  The letter disappears from the inbox, but it can always be found in completed or searched. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/143/eae/7fc/143eae7fcfd945298d1d238886dd16b0.png" alt="All the main features are"></div><br><br>  Actually, what can you do with a specific letter?  Immediately under the letter, you can write an answer (do not be alarmed that the field looks like one line, as soon as you start writing, both To whom and the opportunity to expand the answer will appear) or forward.  The main features are in the upper right corner - <b>Pin</b> , <b>Postpone</b> , <b>Run</b> and <b>Move</b> .  About <b>Run</b> I already wrote above - an analogue Archive.  The letter is then hidden from the Inbox and can be found in Completed.  So to say - the letter is read and processed.  <b>You</b> can <b>move</b> to automatic groups, if you suddenly got the wrong one, or to any of your shortcuts, or you can create a new one.  On the rest we will stop in more detail. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bec/c7b/79a/becc7b79a2dc48c59b57649e4d22461b.png" alt="Fixed"></div><br><br>  If you fasten a letter (the symbol of a clerical button), the letter remains in your inbox and is not grouped with other letters, which is convenient if you want to mark some important letter.  Disappears if you do or postpone (in this case, it will appear after the moment before which it was postponed).  All the fixed can be viewed on the switch in the upper right corner of the interface. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6f2/cab/cc5/6f2cabcc5dfb4498b94f988f0e63a103.png" alt="Deferred"></div><br><br>  A nice feature is that letters can be put off.  Let's say you're on the road and you are uncomfortable responding to an incoming letter now or if there is no necessary information (you need to look at your work computer).  What to do and how not to forget about this letter?  In Gmail, you would mark it as unread and it would continue to hang out among fellow inboxes.  Well, maybe an asterisk or important would be set.  Inbox is more convenient.  You can postpone any letter for a <b>specific time</b> (morning, afternoon, evening, night, tomorrow), for <b>an indefinite time</b> , for a <b>specific date / time</b> or ... / * drum roll * / until you arrive at a <b>certain place</b> !  Yes, you can now postpone the letter until you arrive at work or home.  Very, very comfortable. <br><br>  And you can immediately make reminders.  With the same opportunities to postpone them to the desired time / place.  And yes, you can mark that the reminder needs to be repeated with a certain frequency.  "Water the cactus" every week at 21 o'clock, for example.  You can always see all the reminders that were set from the menu. <br><br>  What kind of mailer, if you can not send letters?  This is done simply - a red round button in the lower left corner: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e64/d3c/15f/e64d3c15fc1e416f8acfdb37f990d77a.gif" alt="Write a letter or add a reminder - easy!"></div><br><br>  From here you can write a letter or add a reminder.  The top three roundels - <b>TOP-3</b> with whom you corresponded recently - you can immediately start writing a letter to them, without filling the Who field.  By clicking on the <b>Write</b> button, a minimalist window appears: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/548/9fc/1f2/5489fc1f29f84617872c07c0be8be740.png" alt="New letter"></div><br><br>  Everything is pretty standard here - you can attach files, add a copy, slightly format the text of the letter, etc. <br><br>  Mobile application repeats all the functionality described above.  Deferred letters and reminders pop up with notifications, as well as new letters.  From the notifications you can immediately put Done or Postpone. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f0d/165/7d8/f0d1657d8a894a40b23ab39e365c85ea.png" alt="Mobile app" width="400"></div><br><br>  It seems about the main functions told.  If you have forgotten - ask in the comments. <br><br>  Additional Information: <br><br>  <a href="http://goo.gl/Fq5oBj">News</a> in the official blog; <br>  <a href="https://support.google.com/inbox/">Help</a> <br><br>  <b>PS</b> Ask for <b>invites</b> at <b>inbox@google.com</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/362211/">https://habr.com/ru/post/362211/</a></p>
