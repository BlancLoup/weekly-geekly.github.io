The post contains pain.  And generally, consult with your psychotherapist. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I am an analyst and have become accustomed: everything always happens not according to TK.  This is the norm, and for a long time it does not cause surprise to me - I began to think that this is the way it should be.  And then suddenly he became interested in machine learning, went to courses, and there he had to do a programming task, and then check three other people like him.  I looked at how the developers perform training tasks, and the puzzle immediately formed in my head, how does all this happen? <br><br>  Immediately I want to answer several important questions.

    <h3>  Or maybe these are not real programmers, but simply beginning armless ghouls? </h3><br>  Not!  There is a stage of acquaintance at these courses, and there everyone usually writes that they have long been in development and decided to upgrade their qualifications.  And the courses themselves are pretty furious, with a lot of matan and rulers.  Not for juniors at all. <br><br><h3>  And how can you check other people's tasks, if you do not rummage? </h3><br>  The task is arranged brilliantly!  They give you a code, and there are places in it where you need to add your own code, but there are places where you need to answer questions with the text, draw conclusions and generalize.  When you check fellow students, sometimes you understand how the same function could be implemented differently.  Kayf! <br><br>  The check-list contains about 40 questions, in the spirit of: ‚ÄúIn the assignment, they asked for 12 signs, not 13. You‚Äôll see if there are 12 signs.‚Äù <br><br>  The thing is that removing the 13th sign was not so easy.  I had to pretty much dock the docks, to learn just like that, oops, and remove the 13th sign in the associative array, not dying of foolish cycles. <br><br><h3>  Well, well, you checked the tasks of the developers, with some experience, and why did you hit there so much? </h3><br>  And it struck me guys, the general presence of the 13th sign.  Just no one began to bother! <br><br>  I would divide 40 test questions into groups: <br><br>  * You need to use some method that is written about.  Usually, everyone copes. <br>  * Need to implement some kind of task.  Usually, too, cope. <br>  * In this task, you need to consider important details.  There are simple details, for example, captions to graphs.  On this all slaughtered.  Although in each check-list there is an item on the check ‚ÄúDoes the schedules have a signature?‚Äù.  I sit, check tasks - no one has a signature! <br><br>  Then there are the little things about which it is not said how they are made.  Well, for example: ‚ÄúDisplay the alpha coefficient‚Äù.  To display it, you need to have a little taste of the docks or guess.  Almost everyone scored. <br><br>  And then there are the little things that need to be done: ‚ÄúOutput the minimum alpha coefficient for each column‚Äù.  But there is no such method, you need to do it manually - no one began to bother. <br><br><h3>  Well, it's the little things!  The main thing, after all, is to understand the principle while studying!  What are you attached to? </h3><br>  First, to see, for example, alpha is simply necessary for understanding the principles.  Secondly, there are still questions like ‚Äúconclusion‚Äù, and if one is careless about small things, then the heat begins in the conclusions.  For example, a person has a ‚Äúhairpin‚Äù on the ceiling, and he writes in the conclusions how beautifully everything converges to a theoretical normal distribution. <br><br><h3>  Well okay to drive!  Have you got any bugs yourself? </h3><br>  Were  I, too, did not agree.  It was visible, and I reworked.  I was tortured with the 13th sign, tortured with alphas. <br><br>  You just need to cut the code until the correct answer to the quest question is found.  And, in contrast to real life with unfinished questions, they don‚Äôt miss it further. <br><br>  And here I was impressed by the second important point.  In order to enjoy how everything works, you had to google a lot.  And, of course, came across other people's projects.  Many even in Github.  And some - hanging on the domain of some office, which offers its development services.  Although dumping tasks, of course, is prohibited.  But who reads the rules?  Well, my sad discovery is that so many authors of these projects dropped out a year or two ago. <br><br>  What can I say!  There was even a kid who was confused and threw the 13th sign out of the list, and even brought one alpha.  True, in the end, this superman got tired, so he scored on graphics in general, and wrote in the conclusions: ‚ÄúWell, it's all the same here.‚Äù <br><br><h3>  Thanks to this experience, I was born to understand how things are not going according to TK </h3><br>  We made a few points, did not bother further, and then got tired, time was tight, and in general they decided not to do a piece. <br><br>  Well, it‚Äôs not that I didn‚Äôt understand this before, and it‚Äôs not that I myself am sinless in this regard, but here it‚Äôs all in full view.  I sit, do tasks with alphas and immediately understand that I will not see them at check. <br><br><h3>  Yes, I know these hands, I'm not like that! </h3><br>  Of course, sometimes developed high definition.  There is a difficulty with them: they will look at the TK, in which there are muddy places, they immediately say: ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs some nonsense, I don‚Äôt work with this!‚Äù is hell.  Well, or think: ‚ÄúWell, it nafig!  And I‚Äôll become a better instructor in skydiving or rock climbing. ‚Äù <br><br>  And there is still such an option.  In TZ, everything is very clear, the razrab scored and let‚Äôs fuss: ‚ÄúOh, you are confused!  Oh, and I thought wrong, but differently. ‚ÄùAnd customers also love:‚Äú Oh, and we thought it goes without saying. ‚Äù <br><br><h3>  Instead of concluding: ‚ÄúAnd how to live with it?‚Äù </h3><br>  Yes, just as before lived: <br><br>  - Mandatory checklist for each task; <br>  - few points at each stage; <br>  - Mandatory discussion of each item by voice; <br>  - short sprints. <br><br>  Of course, the customer wants a complete stuffing, and that he must be shown a ready-made system.  It is necessary to resist and with pain to form a checklist of low-level points for a short stage.  And yes, I like to say a voice with every voice both with the customer and with the developer.  And I also like to register directly in the TZ, which will not be implemented. <br><br>  And sometimes I score on some of these light principles for some reason and suffer ... <br><br>  PS: <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/zharikovpro/" class="user_link">zharikovpro</a> complements, about <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/340052/">checklists based on the layout</a> : </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/340052/">https://habr.com/ru/post/340052/</a></p>
