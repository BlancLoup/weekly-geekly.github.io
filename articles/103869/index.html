      <b>There is a lot of traffic under the cut.</b> <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>City portal eesti.ee</b> <b><br></b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/a6/d2/a6d275c0d433bc34121ab94289124a5c.png" alt="image"><br>  <a href="">Full size picture.</a> <br><br>  This is the largest and most important portal about which every citizen of Estonia must know (But not everyone knows about it).  Through this portal, you can view any of your data up to the logs of your transfers from class to class. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/75/9b/759b9941b8945db86f9ba5d1567c16ed.png" alt="image"><br>  <a href="">Full size picture.</a> <br><br>  You can enter the city portal using an ID card (which any citizen who has reached 15 years of age has), via a mobile phone (Mobiil-ID technology - Read more - here - <a href="http://id.ee/%3Fid%3D10356">id.ee/?id=10356</a> ).  However, you must first activate this service with a mobile operator. <br><br>  They were not even too lazy and shot a small video clip about how the Mobile-ID system works. <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/u_gWuGoxgRg&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhiLX6QXje95vfP15qER54ACPfTV2g" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Login can also be made via the Internet bank.  You can read more about the ID card in Wikipedia - <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25AD%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_ID-%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0">ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estonian_ID-card</a> or from the link I gave at the beginning of the topic. <br><br>  I prefer to enter through the ID card as for me it is the fastest and most convenient way to enter.  All that is required of me is to insert my ID card into the reader (Reader cost up to $ 10, in banks is often issued free of charge), connect it to the computer, and enter a PIN code which consists of 4 digits and which was issued together with the ID card.  There are drivers for both Windows, Mac and Linux, which is good news.  (Under Linux, the truth does not rise without dancing with a tambourine).  After installing the software, you can use the ID card to enter the state portal and other services which will be discussed below, the software is compatible with Windows with IE and Firefox, with Mac - Safari and Firefox, with Linux with Firefox. <br><br>  Log in as follows. <br><br>  I go to a site that interests me, in my case eesti.ee and watch this form of entry. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/85/79/8579705e74f2ee5278b781c11e8e2db9.png" alt="image"><br>  <a href="">Full size screenshot</a> <br><br>  Then I click on the Authorization button using the ID card and a small window appears asking to enter the PIN code. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/a0/8f/a08f9ac35545374dc6f953781d986fda.png" alt="image"><br>  <a href="">Full size screenshot.</a> <br><br>  If the PIN code is entered correctly, a sign appears asking me to identify myself with a certificate. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/d2/1f/d21f90c9db3449eefbfd83d632359ad5.png" alt="image"><br>  <a href="">Full size screenshot.</a> <br>  Click on the OK button and everything, you have successfully entered the state portal. <br><br>  I will give an example of how you can use the portal eesti.ee in everyday life. <br>  Autumn has come and for many newly graduated students a new problem has arrived - the army, how can the eesti.ee portal help?  Very simple, find the necessary form and if you study at the university, you can ask for a delay of up to 3 years. <br>  Thus, the state portal saves you from having to go to this gloomy place the name to which the draft board.  Similarly, you can fill out most of the documents. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/57/c9/57c96db532afe36a585a905088fd9b2b.png" alt="image"><br>  <a href="">Full size screenshot.</a> <br><br>  It looks like a deferment form, note that half of the personal data is already filled in, which is good news. <br><br>  Enough about the state portal, moving to other equally interesting services. <br><br>  <b>E-school.</b>  <b>(http://ekool.ee)</b> <b><br></b> <br>  This system was established in 2002 and most schools are currently connected to the so-called e-school system or (eKool), this system is a complete replacement of paper journals where all your omissions and evaluations were noted.  In this system, a student can see all his grades, see upcoming quizzes or homework, and the teacher can conveniently add grades, assignments, comments, etc.  There is also access for parents to monitor the progress of their children. <br><br>  Unfortunately, since I have already graduated from school, I will not be able to fully demonstrate the functionality of this service. <br><br>  When entering eKool I am politely warned that I do not have access to the system <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/8b/a5/8ba5b04b04dfb30c6028203fa0ded64a.png" alt="image"><br>  <a href="">Full size screenshot.</a> <br><br>  However, for some reason left the opportunity to lead a small todo sheet. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/5d/23/5d23ed59bddc81ca19d4eb460c7f1693.png" alt="image"><br>  <a href="">Full size screenshot.</a> <br><br>  Since the new school year, the service has undergone many changes, according to friends, added elements of a social network, the ability to add to friends, add photos, and even the ability to run a personal blog.  Some students oppose such changes, see for example here - <a href="http://www.facebook.com/uus.ekool%3Fv%3Dwall">www.facebook.com/uus.ekool?v=wall</a> , quote ‚ÄúWe DON'T like THE new eKool !!‚Äù <br><br>  <b>Digital signing of documents</b> <b><br></b> <br>  Imagine the situation, you need to write a business letter, but bad luck, the interlocutor on the other end can not be sure that you are the one for whom you are posing.  This problem is intended to solve the digital signing of documents. <br><br>  Digital signing of documents is as follows.  For Windows, special software is downloaded - <a href="http://id.ee/%3Fid%3D11147">id.ee/?id=11147</a> . <br><br>  For Linux and Mac, the DigiDoc Web service is available where you can download a document and get a signed document or download a signed document and be able to read the decrypted document.  - <a href="https://digidoc.sk.ee/%3Ff%3Dchg_lang%26lang%3Dru">digidoc.sk.ee/?f=chg_lang&amp;lang=en</a> <br><br>  In short, the recipient gets the opportunity to see that the document was indeed sent from such and such a person, a sort of confirmation of identity. <br><br>  Some screenshots. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/47/96/479600b9101ef30b8cfd21aab6ec0a75.png" alt="image"><br>  <a href="">Full size screenshot.</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/1e/aa/1eaa29025d09effa82d3a9f8ca7a5a26.png" alt="image"><br>  <a href="">Full size screenshot.</a> <br><br>  <b>Buying tickets for public transport</b> <b><br></b> <br>  No less interesting is the sale of tickets for public transport through the portal <a href="https://www.pilet.ee/cgi-bin/splususer/splususer.cgi%3Flang%3Dru">www.pilet.ee/cgi-bin/splususer/splususer.cgi?lang=ru</a> . <br><br>  Through it, you can buy tickets for public transport and check its operation, the service is notable because it automatically checks your eligibility through a single database, in case you do not have the privilege, it will sell you a ticket anyway, but an inscription appears that the right to benefit is missing. <br><br>  When controllers stop the bus, all you need is just to give it an ID card.  The verification process takes a few seconds.  If the right to a benefit is not found, and a ticket has been purchased for a discount, the controller has the right to ask for a paper document confirming the availability of the benefit. <br><br>  This is the interface of the purchased tickets. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/e7/dd/e7ddec6ac31296a0462344ba70a796ca.png" alt="image"><br>  <a href="">Full size screenshot.</a> <br><br>  People who do not really trust high-tech can still use paper tickets or also pay ID-tickets at any kiosk where the seller will issue a ticket for you in a minute. <br><br>  <b>Digital recipes</b> <b><br></b> <br>  A new service that was introduced last year.  This service records your visits to the doctor and if the doctor prescribes you any medicine, all you have to do is go to the pharmacist and give him an ID card, after which the pharmacist sees only those medicines that your doctor prescribed for you. <br><br>  It looks like this: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/cc/c4/ccc4649166be9500ba91a86bffb13a70.png" alt="image"><br>  <a href="">Full size screenshot.</a> <br><br>  <b>Electronic Elections</b> <br><br>  This was much talked about in Habr√©, you can read more, for example, here - <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/the_future_is_here/60749/">habrahabr.ru/blogs/the_future_is_here/60749</a> <br>  So I will not stay here for a long time, I will only say that yes there is, yes it is convenient, everything works, everyone is happy.  Every year more and more people vote in this way. <br><br>  Separate attention is given to the system of laying routes for public transport which is located on kaart.tallinn.ee, you drive in the starting and ending address, the time of arrival, and you get the route to the destination point. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/04/50/0450a880c78d0577ffdf959a1c01f26f.png" alt="image"><br>  <a href="">Full size screenshot.</a> <br><br>  Summing up, I would like to say that all services are made with love, if I may say so, any citizen can express his wishes and complaints. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/e3/e2/e3e2e2b6ecff40f128926544f0315306.png" alt="image"><br>  <a href="">Full size screenshot.</a> <br><br>  From the minuses it can be noted that the Russification is often lame, all the same, the state language is not Russian here, so that is forgivable. <br><br>  I will be happy to answer any questions you may have because of my knowledge. <br><br>  I apologize if it is written a little messy. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/103869/">https://habr.com/ru/post/103869/</a></p>
