Today we will reveal the cards and talk about the perfect tool for support services. <br><br>  To understand what is wrong with e-mail and why we decided to create Usedesk, first we will look at what participants in the service process need: <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>To customer</b> <br>  not so much.  Solving the problem for the optimal time in his opinion.  The human attitude at the same time, and not the phrase phrases - by default, and not a nice bonus.  What time is optimal?  When I cannot withdraw money from an ATM, I want my question at the bank to be answered from the first call, if I write in support of an online store by e-mail, I hope to get an answer at least during the day.

      <b>Employee</b> <br>  most often you want to go out for a smoke or drink coffee.  Customers ask the same "stupid" questions.  You, like a robot, dozens of times write the same thing.  The flow of letters does not end there: where is spam, where was the address wrong and wanted to write to marketing, and they wrote to you where the trouble really happened - it‚Äôs bad if everything is in one heap.  And if to solve the issue urgently need information from the IT-department, then the case is a pipe.  Until they get to your letter and respond, the outraged customer will remind of himself with three more messages. <br><br>  <b>To the head</b> <br>  you should understand what is happening in this black box.  How many calls do we have?  And what is asked?  And who answers faster - Kolya or Sveta?  Or maybe too many claims on the delivery time of our boots, and we need to quickly deliver or indicate another time on the site? <br><br>  <b>Business owner</b> <br>  need happy customers and sales. <br><br>  <i>Why e-mail as a support tool can not cope with these "need?".</i> <br><br>  <b>Does not give a clear task</b> <br><br>  Which letter is important and which one will wait?  What re?  And we already answered this letter?  Damn, forgot to tick and answered again. <br>  Remember how at school mom said: ‚ÄúClean up the table!‚Äù - ‚ÄúWhy?  I already know where that lies.  And in general, this is not a mess, but a creative mess. ‚Äù  What will the creative mess in your inbox lead to?  To unanswered letter and unhappy customer.  And one dissatisfied client = from two to infinity dissatisfied, depending on the severity of the unsolved problem.  To work effectively, it must be streamlined.  Usedesk offers you this order with <b>statuses, priorities, filters, and a collision detector</b> . <br><br>  Employees see what they work with.  Requests are ordered by priority depending on the time, theme and content of the request, the sender and the performer - customize as you like to see what needs attention first. <br><br>  At what stage the processing of the request, will show the status.  ‚ÄúI want to participate in the action,‚Äù the client writes.  You have three stocks in your company, and you will inquire what stock attracted it.  It is convenient to use the status of ‚Äúpending‚Äù: you have already accepted the request for work, but have not yet answered the client‚Äôs question completely and are waiting for additional information from him.  Want to quickly get to all requests "on hold" - create a filter and enjoy the work on the principle of "divide and conquer." <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a1d/7ba/08c/a1d7ba08c4234468b3a7e5cc92602724.png"><br>  It is bad when the client is waiting for eternity or does not receive a response at all.  No better than that awkward situation when a client received three different answers for one question.  Yes, think about it!  Do not think.  The client has already suspected that you have problems with the competence of employees, and even there is no system for handling complaints.  Email does not offer you a way to get rid of duplicate responses.  In Usedesk we built <b>a collision detector.</b>  There is a useful thing behind the ornate name and it works like this: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4d8/174/52c/4d817452c99447f4be2cd575a0b42afb.png"><br>  You see, when someone views or changes the request.  One request - one responsible, no confusion. <br><br>  <b>Does not guarantee that a colleague from another department will help quickly</b> <br><br>  The client communicates only with customer support.  What happens to his letter inside your company does not bother him.  Once I waited a week for a response from the hotel, whether my reservation was confirmed or not.  A week later, I received a message: ‚ÄúSorry, the fact is that we have been waiting for a response from our accountant for a long time to find out if your payment has been received.  She mistakenly deleted the letter from the box ... ".  Thanks for the honesty guys, but I don't need excuses, I needed a prompt response. <br><br>  Solving customer problems requires the help of other departments.  The use of multiple communication channels within the company is nonsense. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/506/9ba/658/5069ba658ea640039afdfa0406166fba.png"><br>  It is easy to recognize that important information is likely to be lost in this thread.  We need the interaction to be simple and fast. <br>  In Usedesk, <b>comments</b> decide this <b>:</b> they are not visible to clients, this is an internal correspondence between employees right there in the client's request. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5b3/110/b98/5b3110b98ce24d58883ae4d04e912a0d.png"><br>  Connect to the work of employees of non-client departments without unnecessary gestures. <br><br>  <b>Makes the client walk the circles of hell</b> <br><br>  I especially appreciate people who understand me perfectly.  Customers for companies feel the same.  When a client formulates a letter in such a way that the essence of the appeal is not clear, you have to ask a bunch of clarifying questions in order to understand what is being said.  Correspondence for clarification of circumstances may be delayed for a long time, but why waste time when you can immerse yourself in resolving the issue? <br>  Win the ‚ÄúWhat?  Where?  When? ‚Äù <b>Client profile</b> will help with contacts and contact history.  Rummaging in the mailbox is not necessary, the context is immediately clear. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/829/eeb/919/829eeb919efd4c07b036c149730ac786.png"><br>  Do not make tedious interrogations that delay the time to solve a problem, meet clients like old friends, and help. <br><br>  <b>Not the fastest</b> <br><br>  The simplest and most complex wow effect is the speed of response, exceeding customer expectations.  The site says that they answer during the day, and you received an answer within half an hour.  It is easy to handle this support if the question is standard.  "What are your payment methods?"  You will spend a minute typing the answer in an email.  Even better, if you have templates prepared in notepad or in Word.  Found the right one, ctrl + c, ctrl + v - 20 seconds, voila!  And what if this is done another 20 times faster? <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4cb/9d2/564/4cb9d2564397400fa66a6169e3aa2563.png"><br>  Submit a pre-made <b>template</b> in two clicks.  Allow employees to tackle complex non-standard issues.  Help and feel useful without wasting time on a stupid routine. <br><br>  <b>Limits automation capabilities</b> <br><br>  You have written down a new feature and it is important to handle all the issues related to it in priority.  In addition, Katerina understands your company best.  Solve this problem with the help of the postal service will not work.  In Usedesk, this is just using a <b>rule.</b>  We put all requests containing a ‚Äúnew feature‚Äù into priority and assign them to Catherine. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/641/fb4/ce1/641fb4ce12a34adea3989cf156453d21.png"><br>  And for questions that come during off-hours, set up an auto answer so that customers do not worry about how long they should wait. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e91/1a9/02f/e911a902fd4549fc9adb5b5ce06ca649.png"><br>  Now your support team is like a slow cooker: threw the ingredients, and everything cooks on its own, and the output is yummy. <br><br>  <b>Does not show analytics</b> <br><br>  Two questions worry the head: what happens and how to fix it.  E-mail will not answer you, who responds to requests faster - Anna or Valeriy, how many claims for refunds per month and at what time your guys are most loaded.  With Usedesk you have everything under control.  Dry numbers will give an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe processes in your support service, will reveal strengths and weaknesses.  Information is power, use it to improve service. <br><br>  The support tool your customers will love is already in the beta version.  We have started and we want a lot of cool service.  We will be glad to questions and constructive feedback.
