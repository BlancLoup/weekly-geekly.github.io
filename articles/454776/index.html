People often ask me why I don‚Äôt realize myself in a company office.  They say that remote work in a company is a kind of golden mean. <br><br>  Now I will try to answer all the questions at once in the form of a certain comparison of work in the office or as a freelancer.  Well, go ahead! <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Your predisposition.  Self-organization or control </h3><br>  In my opinion, an important point when choosing your path is precisely your ability to self-organize or the need for control. <br><br>  If we are less and less adapted to our work schedules, bosses and teams since childhood (this is both a kindergarten, a school, and a university), then there is a slightly different story with freelancing.

      You need to understand that a freelancer is his own boss and subordinate.  Forms himself a schedule, loads of work and assigns vacation. <br><br>  This is not for everyone, I know many people who, with all their desire, cannot bring themselves to work diligently if no one controls them.  Because of the inability to self-organize, such people are more comfortable in the office, as there is a clear timetable, the boss who says what to do and when, an equipped workplace, even a coffee maker. <br><br>  Hmm  It turns out companies consist of unorganized people? <br><br>  You need to listen to yourself and see if you can work independently, without clear instructions, of office walls and staff. <br><br>  For me, for example, the situation is somewhat different.  I started my career as a freelancer sitting in the office of one of the factories back in 2008, and despite the fact that I was terribly lazy, it was the monotonous and greenhouse everyday life of the office that pushed me on adventures.  And bosses, work schedules and holidays once a year.  This is not for me. <br><br>  In any case, do not rush to make hasty conclusions, because this is only the beginning. <br><br><h3>  The ease of starting a career.  Specialist or Employee </h3><br>  Imagine that a specialty has been chosen, the training has been completed and you think about where it is easier to start your career. <br><br>  So, let's consider the main differences starting your way in the office and freelancing.  For this, I collected a few basic requirements that need to be met in order to get a job. <br><br>  For freelancing it is: <br><br><ol><li>  Possess practical and theoretical knowledge in their field.  That is, to be able to do what I decided to do. </li><li>  Have access to the necessary tools.  In other words, buy, lend, <s>steal</s> or rent the necessary tools or equipment for the quality of the order. </li><li>  Find a market for your product or service.  Sign up for freelance exchanges, or find other sites where you can offer exactly your services. </li><li>  Have basic verbal or written communication skills.  That is, to be able to talk with people, customers. </li></ol><br>  Example.  You are an artist, accordingly you should be able to draw, own all the necessary brushes, paints and, in fact, be ready to find a potential client and offer your services. <br><br>  The requirements for starting a career in an office are extremely varied depending on the specific company, I tried to identify the main ones: <br><br><ol><li>  Here, too, you need to possess knowledge of their specialty.  But it is precisely those subspecies, technologies and tools that requires a specific job. </li><li>  To possess additional knowledge of programs and practices that are used in a particular office. </li><li>  To be young.  This item is not always voiced, but, unfortunately, practice shows that it should be included here. </li><li>  To speak English.  I do not see anything bad in the very knowledge of the language, but nevertheless this is an additional requirement. </li><li>  Be a team player.  As a rule, for the company it is more important than your knowledge.  For management, it is necessary to manage the team painlessly, so ‚Äúupstarts‚Äù and overly ambitious candidates who are not used to playing by the rules are likely to be eliminated. </li></ol><br>  Example.  You are a programmer, respectively, you need to own exactly the programming language specified in the vacancy.  And also possess additional knowledge of various office programs for working in a team.  As a rule, be young and know English.  To be able and to love working in a team, and your ambitions should not go beyond the company. <br><br>  Accordingly, if you fit the requirements of the job, then after an interview and a test period, you can start earning. <br>  Summarize the differences in career start. <br><br>  At first glance, points at freelancing look less frightening: all you have to do is be an expert in your business and you can already begin your freelance career.  But you yourself have to buy tools for your work ‚Äî a computer, brushes, a camera, and so on.  And also look for orders and communicate with customers. <br><br>  The company also provides you with work and all the necessary tools, but it needs not just a ‚Äúspecialist‚Äù, it needs just an ‚Äúemployee‚Äù - a person who combines the entire list of requirements.  Including has certain character traits and knowledge, often not directly related to the work. <br><br>  So here I am a specialist.  And at work I want to be judged by the deeds, not by chatter.  Unless, of course, this is not the same thing. <br><br><h3>  Availability.  Freelance calls all </h3><br>  In the previous chapter, we did not take into account a large number of different factors and considered the differences in starting a career with, so to speak, the ideal candidate.  So let's add real life truth to all of the above. <br><br>  Let's say you live in a small city or not in the city at all.  Accordingly, in order to get a job in a company that does not smell in your village, you have to move or drive.  In both cases, the availability of work in the company for you decreases.  Since you will spend more time getting to work or incur financial losses to rent an apartment, transport. <br><br>  What if you are far from 20 years old?  You live with the knowledge that you once made a wrong choice and gave your young years to an unloved profession.  And finally I had the courage to change everything in order to adequately provide for my family.  Sorry, but competing for a place in the company will be more difficult due to age and established habits. <br><br>  Or are you a young mother who would like to do business not to the detriment of raising a child.  I doubt that the office schedule will suit you. <br><br>  What to do if you have health problems, are you low in mobility, or are you just uncomfortable being among people?  I'm afraid the company‚Äôs doors are closed for you. <br><br>  Perhaps you are a minor teenager or a student seeking a part-time job for the summer?  So do not get into the company. <br><br>  I am sure there are more people like you than young people who have just graduated from the capital's university.  All doors are open for her, but what do you do? <br><br>  I was born and raised in a small town of 10,000 people.  And I didn‚Äôt have a lot of chances to make a brilliant IT-career.  But in my example I will tell you one thing - <b>freelancing calls everyone</b> . <br><br>  It is absolutely not important for a freelance client how old you are, where you live, what university you graduated from and whether you graduated at all.  He doesn't care how you look and what your motivation is. <br>  All that matters to him is the completed order.  Qualitatively and in time. <br><br>  Therefore, if we are talking about accessibility for the general public of completely different people, freelancing for one reason or another has a clear advantage. <br><br>  So whoever I am, wherever I live and whatever I have done before, everyone is equal in freelancing.  I, like any other person, can work freely and earn decently! <br><br><h3>  Stability.  Freedom of action or covered ass? </h3><br>  My parents always told me: ‚ÄúWe need to work in a big company.  Stability is first of all. ‚Äù  And it's hard not to agree with them. <br><br>  From the work in a large company looks much more reliable than freelancing, and having a stable projected income is much easier to plan your future, to be confident in the future.  And then there's insurance and a pension. <br><br>  It is because of the lack of stability of orders that many newbies give up freelancing in favor of the office.  At the same time, many experts leave the office for freelancing due to lack of freedom of action. <br><br>  Tell your story.  In 2003, while still at university, I began working at a large car factory.  He worked in the department of customs clearance, which was considered prestigious.  A good team, a good salary, a company car, a quick increase.  Not a job but a dream, especially in my small town! <br><br>  But it became boring for me, very quickly I began to strain my work schedule, because the work was not always, but I had to sit in the office ‚Äúfrom call to call‚Äù.  And at some point, out of boredom, I began to drop into the freelance exchange.  Then I was not a specialist in creating websites, so self-taught.  But I managed to take one or two small orders.  Then I did not understand how much it will affect my life. <br><br>  And in 2008 there was an economic crisis.  Our plant has almost stopped.  Began cuts.  At this time I live with my future wife in a rented apartment.  And only my beginnings on freelancing helped me to stay afloat.  I was already burning with the dream of earning without leaving home, without graphics and bosses, without frames and borders! <br><br>  In August of the same year, I earned on renting an apartment.  And in December, my income on freelance exceeded the salary at the plant twice.  And, most importantly, today is 2019 and I'm still a freelancer.  What is not an indicator of stability? <br><br>  Of course, this is just my story.  And everything could be different.  But I am sure that even without a crisis, sooner or later I would have left for freelancing anyway.  I would risk it! <br><br>  I believe that only being alone with my beloved work, without control and restrictions, one can qualitatively develop as a separate independent specialist.  And yes, you have to independently form your own stream of orders.  In a company, often the other side of stability is all sorts of restrictions - in the technologies used, programs, methods, behavior, appearance, and so on. <br><br>  My story is designed to show you that anything can happen.  And without having the skills to <b>work "in the field"</b> , that is, independently, for one reason or another, you can instantly be left out. <br><br>  I definitely feel closer to the risk for the freedom of realization and development of my capabilities as a freelancer, and not a calm and relatively stable way under the company's wing. <br><br><h3>  Comfort.  Life or PlayStation 4? </h3><br>  As a result of Google search, I found out that residents of post-Soviet countries spend about 6.5 years of their lives on work.  At first glance, it doesn‚Äôt sound much, but if you think that counting is from 20 to 65 years old, and a third of our lives we sleep, then it turns out that work takes almost all of our active time. <br><br>  Therefore, it is very important that you feel comfortable and cozy while at the workplace.  Modern companies understand this and form the workflow, equip their offices so that work is more comfortable. <br><br>  As a rule, your workplace will be equipped with all the necessary equipment for work.  Well, during the break you have the opportunity to drink coffee from the office coffee maker, relieve stress in the gym or play in the PlayStation.  Also, companies constantly declare a friendly team, various joint entertainment, teambuilding, training courses.  The ability to move to another city or country, where the offices of the company and much more.  Add to this the fact that the company keeps accounting for you, encourages cash prizes, gives gifts for birthdays, arranges New Year's corporate events, in general, paradise, and not work! <br><br>  What can freelance offer me?  And nothing, and at the same time all!  Let's figure it out. <br><br>  Having chosen the career of a freelancer, I automatically lost all of the nice office buns without exception.  So what's comfortable in freelancing? <br><br>  To begin with, by our 6.5 working years we should add the time that we spend on getting to our comfortable office, and this is still about 2 years of standing in traffic jams, subways, and shuttles.  So, working remotely, you definitely spend this time more comfortable. <br><br>  Work schedule.  I form it myself!  Reluctance to get up in the morning?  Not a problem - I work when it is comfortable. <br><br>  We go further.  Workplace.  Recall the famous saying "Everywhere is good, but at home is better." <br>  Is there a more comfortable place than your own home?  There you can be yourself, work in one sock, well, or in two, listen to your favorite music, set up a comfortable air temperature, eat homemade food.  Perform tasks on your computer using your favorite programs and tools. <br><br>  The distance from my bed to the workplace is only ~ 2m.  And waking up, I do not think about how lazy to get up to put myself in order and get to work.  My mood is positive and joyful, which leads to good working results. <br><br>  A friendly team is great, but what if it's not completely friendly?  All of us are people and sooner or later become the heroes of office gossip and intrigue, which in no way adds comfort to the working process. <br><br>  Maximum comfort will bring and leave, not only that I determine its duration myself, but I also rest exactly when it is needed. <br><br>  My personal opinion is that the company really provides you with all the attributes of a comfortable life, <b>but not life itself</b> .  I am pleased to communicate with friends and not with colleagues, and at that moment when I want it.  Ride to other cities and countries to rest, not to work.  Have the ability to allocate time and earnings as it is needed at the moment.  Yes, in return, I have to keep the accounting department myself, form a work schedule and control my rest.  But damn, it's worth it! <br>  Well, buy a PlayStation home is no problem. <br><br><h3>  Income level.  Better a hand in the sky than a bird in a crane </h3><br>  According to my observations, the level of earnings of the same specialist in the company and freelancing will be about the same, except that the freelancer will spend less time on work and around the work activities mentioned above.  Both in the company and in freelancing, there is a career growth.  Accordingly, the level of earnings varies depending on how developed you are as a specialist.  In the company they raise you and give you a higher salary.  The freelancer himself raises his price when he considers it necessary. <br><br>  But there is one significant difference! <br><br>  The level of salary in a company is often limited by region, country, competitors, and the desire for leadership. <br><br>  A freelancer can offer his services all over the world without having intermediaries.  And this means that by making efforts, you can enter the markets where the level of salary for the same service is several times higher than in a local company. <br><br>  For example, while sitting in Zhmerynka you can carry out a client's order from Tallinn, Berlin, New York, without having intermediaries in the form of company management, which takes a lot of money for its services. <br><br>  And in spite of the fact that it is more difficult to find an expensive client than in the company, but a freelancer definitely has the opportunity to repeatedly increase his income! <br><br><h3>  Remote work in the company.  Golden mean? </h3><br>  What does it mean to work in a company remotely?  All the same as the usual work in the company, only without visiting the office.  The requirements for a remote worker are the same as for an office worker, but there is much more accessibility, while all the advantages of stability remain.  As for comfort, you will lose some of the buns that you could or could use while in the office.  These are coffee, ball playstation, gym and so on.  But team building, training and bonuses remain.  Differences from freelancing are no longer so obvious, but they are still there. <br><br>  Despite the fact that you do not need to go to work, which is incredibly cool, but you will most likely have a certain work schedule, the number of hours per day that you have to work out. <br>  The team and the team have not gone away, they are just not in the same room with you, but all the programs and methods of teamwork will have to be used.  Holidays and wages are also regulated by the company. <br><br>  Who would work in a remote office?  In my opinion, this opportunity is worth paying attention to people who understand the absurdity of getting to work, but are not ready to embark on a free swim.  Who appreciate home comfort, but at the same time prefer the stability of office salaries.  It is also suitable for people with limited mobility, young mothers, those who are not ready to move or reach.  But, as in the case of the office, the candidate needs full compliance with all the requirements of this company and the vacancy. <br><br>  Should I call the "remote" golden mean?  Maybe you are right.  But for me personally, the <b>company and in Africa the company</b> , with all the bureaucratic problems, restrictions and controls.  Personally, on the contrary, it would be more difficult for me to observe all the rules while sitting at home. <br><br><h3>  Perspectives.  And then what? </h3><br>  We have already dismantled a lot of information about the current realities of the office and freelancing.  It's time to look into the future and understand what awaits you ahead of each of the roads. <br><br>  Successful work in the company implies career growth.  First you are Junior, then Middle, then Senior and Lead.  What leads to an increase in wages, improved working conditions, perhaps moving to another city, country. <br><br>  The freelancer has <b>no divisions into classes and classes</b> .  Your level of income depends on your skill, responsibility and the market that you managed to reach.  And working conditions on how skillfully you manage time and prioritize. <br><br>  But there is a more serious difference, which, in my opinion, influences the future to the maximum. <br><br>  Freelancer is essentially a company, only as part of one person.  And this person, having worked for a certain time, besides his specialty, possesses the skills of an accountant, a manager, even a specialist in personnel. <br><br>  Unlike an office worker, a freelancer is a full-fledged individual specialist.  Able to independently find the order, process it, fulfill the quality and receive payment. <br>  By adding to this the ability to self-organize, we get a potential leader! <br><br>  And despite the fact that it‚Äôs possible that the company‚Äôs knowledge of the device is inside it less compared to an office worker, but in its spirit and predisposition, as well as in a place with acquired skills and experience, freelancers can easily grow into a large company with their staff and maybe even with his office, as strange as it sounds.  And in other non-business cases, show the skills of a leader and a creator. <br><br><h3>  Results  Drumroll </h3><br>  In general, office and freelance can be compared using the example of television and YouTube.  On television, they will provide you with equipment, a studio, spectators and a good salary, in return, they will ask you to conform to the format of a particular channel or program.  On YouTube, you will have to do everything yourself, but for that you will have unlimited freedom of self-realization at your disposal. <br><br>  I drown for freelancing, but whatever path you choose, remember - Live, and work in your free time! <br><br>  Based on the issue of <a href="https://youtu.be/1myXPWLj2ew">freelance or office.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/1myXPWLj2ew">Analysis of KEY differences</a> on YouTube channel " <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/freelancerlifestyle">Freelancer for life</a> " </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/454776/">https://habr.com/ru/post/454776/</a></p>
