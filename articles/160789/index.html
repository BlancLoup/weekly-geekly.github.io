      In practice, this means that if you attain enlightenment, you will know everything.  In general, everything, even that, until which science has not yet realized.  You will understand the essence of things.  The super connection in the universal mind will allow you to create many ‚Äúmagical‚Äù pieces such as astral journeys, conscious rebirths, etc. <br><br>  It's like in a computer game to dial a cheat code and pump your character. <br>  And it seems that Buddhists have a proven way. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  This method is concluded in practices (prostration, mantra, etc.). <br>  A practitioner recites a mantra and on each syllable represents a certain image.  Sometimes, to facilitate synchronization and enhancement of perception, different attributes are used. <br>  For example, there is a mantra of generosity.  For practice, you need a special metal beautiful plate and a mixture of small multi-colored pebbles and rice grains.  Take the plate in your left hand upside down, imagine a huge mountain passing through the center of the earth on it, take a handful of stones and put it on a small pile on four sides around an imaginary mountain, while imagining that these pebbles are all the most precious that you have of their material things, then imagine that all these treasures from your heart you give to someone, while with your right hand you need to brush all the pebbles down from the plate where the handkerchief is prudently laid) <br><br>  The point is that you need to repeat this procedure one hundred thousand times, more precisely 111111 times (this number symbolizes infinity). <br>  And then you will become generous. <br>  There are many such mantras and procedures, and if they are done a hundred thousand times each, it will take several decades, which, in general, the monks do. <br>  In the meantime, as we all know from the school course in natural history, certain changes are taking place in the monk‚Äôs brain.  A certain sequence of images forms connections between certain neurons and drives an electrical signal through them.  The more we repeat this sequence, the more times the signal travels through these connections, making them thicker and stronger.  As a result of repeating a sequence one hundred thousand times, the main strong connections between certain neurons are obtained, which are thicker than almost all existing ones, since there is little that people have repeated in their lives more than one hundred thousand times. <br>  Accordingly, paving the highway of generosity in his brain, if a monk finds himself in a situation where he will need to show either generosity or greed, he is guaranteed to be generous. <br>  Thus, there is a gradual transformation of the brain, which at some point leads to enlightenment.  On this path to enlightenment, a person gradually loses his personality, old unnecessary connections in the brain weaken and break, with them fears gradually disappear, the ego collapses and you become a completely different person.  On the other hand, if you don‚Äôt bother with anything like that and just live as you lived, all the same, in 20 years you will be a different person, but ‚Äúevolved randomly and unpredictably‚Äù.  If you continue the thought, then it turns out that monks who have been practicing the same practices for years turn into the same, but very wise people and they will behave the same in any situation? <br><br>  <i>Forgive me, the Sivaslav Buddhist brothers, because they messed up.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>All good karma!</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/160789/">https://habr.com/ru/post/160789/</a></p>
