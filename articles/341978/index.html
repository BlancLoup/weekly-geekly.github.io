It even sounds convincing, because programmers understand the needs of programmers and share the common pain caused by recruiters. <br><br>  I had this thought - ‚ÄúNow I will do it as it should be.‚Äù  So my project appeared.  So there are thousands of projects created by programmers. <br><br>  Most of my ideas for improving the employment process have been misleading.  For example, the idea to post a job description on your site.  This sounds at least strange, because so many platforms do just that.  But quite experienced recruiters do not even want to think about the topic of job placement.  I do not know how much the publication of vacancies is beneficial for so many projects, but I did not implement this functionality for the reason that it did not solve the main task.

    <blockquote>  And the main task is to make a job search a simple and useful task. </blockquote><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Of course, I would create job descriptions with only the most important and necessary information, which would make their reading an interesting process (and this would be another naive delusion).  But to look at job descriptions every day, even if they are interesting and selected by a special algorithm (a fashionable topic today), is not only boring, but also time-consuming.  But the most important thing is that half of these ‚Äúsweet‚Äù vacancies are empty fillings ... (this method should be familiar to everyone who had to look for an apartment for rent).  I can give my own case as an example.  In a LinkedIn feed, I saw the ad: Remote contract job opportunity.  Remote + contract - what I was looking for so long.  I sent my resume and persistently asked to send a job description.  In the end, I was answered by another recruiter from the same company with the words: this vacancy is currently in the plans only ... <br><br><h2>  So what can make a job search a simple and rewarding pastime? </h2><br>  Let's briefly dwell on how the job search in the EU is going.  This is how it happened to me until recently (despite the availability of my project, I am looking for a job, as this is useful for the project and 3 years in the same company is a lot for me) <br><br>  It all starts with the fact that I need a new job, and, the earlier, the better.  At this stage I am already the loser, but I still do not understand it. <br><br>  So: <br>  I am making a resume, because it is outdated because I did not observe one of the principles of job search (you need to look for work when you don‚Äôt really need it) <br><br>  I comb my LinkedIn account ... If only!  I never did this, because I had no idea how powerful this tool was if I knew how to use it. <br><br>  I am sending a resume to the addresses of recruiters / agents I have (who periodically send me vacancies). <br><br>  I upload my resume on a bunch of different resume aggregators and vacancies.  This is the surest way to secure an influx of spam over the next couple of months. <br><br>  I look at vacancies on stackoverflow and send resumes to the ones I like, but how tiresome I am to invent a cover letter for each vacancy, much less fill out forms that are part of the application for a vacancy, for example, answering this question: ‚ÄúDescribe how you would implement JavaScript saving and replaying user actions on the site. ‚Äù  This is how much time you need to spend, and perhaps no one will even read! <br><br>  Pretty soon, I get calls from recruiters.  They conduct familiarization talks with me, ask about my experience, although this is all on the summary ... <br><br>  They also like to call during office hours when I do not have time to communicate or it is very limited.  Such recruiters sometimes write to the post office ‚ÄúI could not reach you ... one of my super clients is looking for a JavaScript engineer ...‚Äù.  But even more often they call again on the same day before the expiration of the working time or the next day, and if I did not answer, they no longer call back. <br><br>  Some send job descriptions and if some interest me, I answer them and ... at least half do not even unsubscribe and do not call.  And I thought that programmers are sorely lacking ... <br><br>  Then the recruiters with whom I made voice contact offer me vacancies and if I liked the position, we agree on the first interview.  Most often, the availability of the employer in priority, but not so difficult to adjust the time to make it convenient for me. <br><br>  After the first successful interview, recruiters ask a ‚Äútricky‚Äù question about whether I am interviewing other companies at the moment.  This question is tricky because you answer it in the style of ‚Äúyes, I have a lot of suggestions‚Äù, believing that the recruiter would consider me an even more valuable candidate and tell the company about it, in which I successfully passed the first interview and they, bypassing the technical interview , they will immediately make me a job offer with a salary 30% higher than I wanted to ask. <br><br>  But in fact, it‚Äôs like confessing to a girl on the first date that your new BMW on credit is not the next 5 years. <br><br>  A recruiter loses interest if he understands that he is competing for you with other employees in the workshop.  Remember, I wrote above about starting an active job search, I was already the loser.  The logic here is that if I need a job urgently, I will try to say this to the largest possible number of recruiters and companies, believing that this should increase my chances.  But in fact, it creates a lot of extra work for me, a lot of unnecessary interviews and test tasks and discourages the interest of experienced recruiters to work with me. <br><br>  This approach to job search generates automated spam mailings with inappropriate vacancies from recruiters who do not read the resume, because it is read by auto-screening programs. <br><br>  How can I expect a professional approach from recruiters if I personally and voluntarily make myself unattractive to them? <br><br><h2>  So what to do? </h2><br>  There is nothing wrong with the fact that you need work as quickly as possible.  It happens.  Bad then, if every new work is needed here and now.  This means that the approach is incorrect and needs to be changed. <br><br>  If so the circumstances that you need to change jobs in the foreseeable future, you should not know about it.  This need to know only those who can and wants to help. <br>  How to find such recruiters?  It is not so difficult.  If you don‚Äôt make the mistakes that I described above and don‚Äôt blow all the pipes instead of working with one or several recruiters (for example, if you are considering different countries and probably one recruiter will not have vacancies in all countries that interest you). <br><br>  Interestingly, even a premium subscription to LinkedIn has a limit on the number of inMail.  This is done in order to limit the flow of spam from overly ‚Äúactive‚Äù candidates.  See what a serious problem this is? <br><br>  Search recruiters worth through LinkedIn (I know that it is blocked, but I will continue).  It is necessary to fill it with detailed information.  Further, even with a free subscription, a simple search is available, for example, by the keyword ‚ÄúIT recruiter‚Äù and indicate the countries of interest.  If the recruiter has an IT recruiter signature - review his account and ask him to contact him.  Often there are signatures with an indication of technology, for example Helping talented JavaScript engineers with jobs in Germany.  If you are a JavaScript engineer / developer, such a recruiter is guaranteed to add you.  So, step by step, you will find recruiters and later in communication with them you will understand with whom it is interesting for you to look for a job. <br><br>  Or you can use my project.  How it works now, I will write further in this article. <br><br><h2>  Less is more! </h2><br>  But ideally, it is better to look for work when it is not really needed.  This is called a passive job search.  It gives you access to recruiters who can help you leisurely find a really interesting job, maybe even in a company or a country you never thought about. <br><br>  How is it that a candidate who is already well employed is so valuable to recruiters? <br><br>  ‚ÄúAccording to statistics, most experienced employment agencies close the lion‚Äôs share of incoming vacancies from their internal base.‚Äù <br><br>  Once having arranged a candidate for a job, having provided him with a positive job search experience, the recruiter automatically ensures almost 100% re-placement of this candidate in 2-3 years.  There are such statistics that an experienced recruiter can turn at least 5 of 25 passive candidates into active ones. <br><br>  Working with such recruiters, you will receive the proper level of service, which is almost impossible with an active search. <br><br>  So simply, without haste and the need to make a quick choice, you get the opportunity to literally pick up a new job almost to order (almost like a tuxedo). <br><br>  With a passive job search, no one will expect you to make a quick decision, no one will spam and pester with calls.  If you think that a job is interesting, you will be able to pass an interview and each time you will have the opportunity to find your weak points and eliminate them.  Or maybe even correct the direction of your career, because the interview process is actually very useful for developing technical skills. <br><br><blockquote>  So the job search becomes a simple and rewarding pastime. </blockquote><br>  But if you absolutely know for sure that you are not going to change jobs, I recommend not to engage in a passive job search.  Do not give false hopes. <br><br>  Now I will briefly write about the project <a href="https://www.itrabota.com/">itRabota</a> and how the above lies in his new strategy. <br><br>  At the moment, the project provides an opportunity to work directly with recruiters, but not only with those whom I have known for a long time!  Now I also promote candidate profiles to recruiters, whom I find and check through LinkedIn.  This is more suitable for active candidates. <br>  The promotion is that, based on the statistics of viewing profiles, I decide to look for recruiters who specialize in specific technologies.  For example, if I have JavaScript programmers with insufficient contact data requests, I am looking for recruiters who specialize in frontend.  Statistics of views and requests for contacts of a profile will also be available to candidates soon. <br><br>  The purpose of recruiting checks is as follows: <br><br><ul><li>  confirm the experience of the recruiter; </li><li>  establish personal contact with him; </li><li>  tell about the candidates, their technical skills and the need for visa support during personal conversation / correspondence, and that visa troubles fade against the background of the high technical level of the candidates (literally, because this is true). </li></ul><br>  It also allows me to avoid distributing candidates' personal data to someone other than recruiters. <br><br>  Recently, I updated the profile creation functionality in order to make it as quick and clear as possible (changes were made on the basis of GA and collected statistics using the tool for analyzing the actions of site visitors). <br><br>  Now you can simply upload your resume without registration. <br>  In the case of registration through LinkedIn, public information will be imported automatically to save time. <br><br>  Of course, it is possible to indicate whether you are an active or passive job search.  This will be a clear indicator for recruiters, and the profile of passive candidates will be available to those recruiters who want and are able to work with passive candidates. <br><br>  There is still such an important point.  Often candidates may be asked what happens when recruiters do not call.  Does someone do a job search or have everyone forgotten already? <br>  It is quite difficult to answer this question ... if only you are not passively looking for a job cooperating with one recruiter who is interested in finding you exactly such a job, for which you will be ready for a change. <br><br>  I also work on introducing a rating for recruiters.  Interestingly, the idea belongs to several recruiters with whom I work. <br><br>  An additional and very important bonus in working with a limited number of recruiters is that I can be in constant contact with them or in other words - keep my finger on the pulse.  Learn from them the status of candidates and collect first-hand statistics on the most popular technologies / trends and share it with candidates. <br><br>  As before, all services for candidates are free.  I take this opportunity to express my gratitude to all the guys who gave interesting advice on how to improve the project or informed about the problems that I was able to quickly resolve.  Thank!!! <br><br>  You can follow the news of the project in <a href="https://www.facebook.com/coolitrabota">FB</a> or <a href="https://vk.com/public101815422">VK</a> groups. <br><br>  PS: <br>  Since it may be thought that I am doing something like LinkedIn, here is my answer: the fundamental difference in controlling the level of competition.  On LinkedIn, there are thousands of competing recruiters and this is a big problem for them.  For me, it‚Äôs not the number of recruiters that matters, but how effectively they help my candidates.  After all, the candidate needs a job, and the recruiter - confidence that in return for a high level of service, he will not be at the bottom of the trough. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/341978/">https://habr.com/ru/post/341978/</a></p>
