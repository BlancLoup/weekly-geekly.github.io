This means that users can now install applications over the Internet without using Bluetooth or wired connection to the computer.  Moreover, using Nokia Drop from PC to phone, everything is also without wires, you can transfer images, links, rss-streams and locations on the map - just in one click! <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/Uon8hlTcRDI&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhgVKiZ9AzhdjH2vkA24crNUfzd-jg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  How it works? </h3><br>  <a href="http://betalabs.nokia.com/apps/nokia-drop">Nokia Drop</a> is an experimental program from <a href="http://betalabs.nokia.com/">Nokia Beta Labs</a> for transferring images, links and coordinates from Nokia maps from a computer's browser to your smartphone.  The program works through push-notifications implemented using the <a href="https://projects.developer.nokia.com/notificationsapi">Notifications API</a> .  The Notifications API includes a Service API to provide access to the Nokia server through the HTTP REST interface, as well as the Client API, which allows mobile applications to register and receive push notifications from the Nokia Notification Server.  By the way, the Notification Support Package is already installed on all <a href="http://www.facebook.com/note.php%3Fnote_id%3D277563395595839">Symbian Anna</a> devices, so this package will not be necessary to download this package to support the Notifications API.

      The Nokia Drop distribution for the phone is the Nokia Smart Installer: during the installation process, the missing components will be automatically downloaded and installed on your device;  This requires a GPRS, 3G or WiFi connection.  After the installation is complete, all that remains is to enter your login and password for your Nokia account.  Everything. <br><br>  To send content from the browser to the smartphone, you will need to download the extension for Firefox ( <a href="">download</a> ) or Chrome ( <a href="">download</a> ).  Extensions are currently available only for these two browsers;  it is good that their market share is growing and now stands at more than 45%. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/e8012b18/641c959f/6a9dc680/08aded73.jpg"><br><br>  After installing the necessary extension, you can use all the features of Nokia Drop, hooray! <br><br><h3>  What do we have? </h3><br><h4>  Installing free apps from Nokia Store </h4><br>  About the installation of applications from the Nokia Store, we have already mentioned.  With the help of Nokia Drop on a smartphone, a user can, with one click, start the installation of the application they like, found in the browser on the computer.  No complicated new actions: if your phone with the launched Nokia Drop application is connected to the Web, simply click the ‚ÄúSend to mobile‚Äù link in the store - and instead of the standard offer to send an SMS with a link to the application, you will see the ‚ÄúDownload to mobile device‚Äù link.  By clicking on it, you will immediately see in Nokia Drop on your phone a link for installing a new application through Nokia Drop. <br><br>  By the way, quite recently the Nokia store has been updated, and now the installation of the above-mentioned browser extension is not required to send applications to Nokia Drop.  It should be noted that in this way you can install only free sis-applications. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/860fff20/afc02a99/36c150ea/1c3a1551.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Sending images, desktop wallpaper </h4><br>  Sometimes an interesting image from the web you want to quickly fill in the phone, or even put the desktop background.  By installing the Nokia Drop extension for your browser, this process can be reduced to a couple of mouse clicks. <br><br>  Just right-click on the desired image and in the menu that appears, select Nokia Drop&gt; Send image or Nokia Drop&gt; Send as wallpaper.  In the first case, the image will immediately load and open on your phone, in the second, it will instantly be added to your phone as wallpaper for the desktop. <br><br>  Note that the image must be publicly available, that is, do not require HTTP authorization and not be on the intranet, cut off from the network.  The fact is that Nokia Drop does not transmit the image itself, but a link to it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/77a048d5/a453c1ad/2f00de75/aa8837ed.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Submitting links and RSS feeds </h4><br>  Just as the images are sent, you can send links or RSS feeds.  All that is required from the user is to click on the link you need to send with the right mouse button and in the context menu select Nokia Drop&gt; Send link (send link) or Send as feed (send as RSS feed).  A link to the current page can be sent simply by clicking on the extension button located in the browser toolbar. <br><br>  Web pages or documents available on the sent link will immediately open in the smartphone.  Avid web surfers should like it. <br><br><h4>  Sending location </h4><br>  In order to send a location on the map, just open the <a href="http://maps.nokia.com/">Nokia maps</a> , find the place of interest and, by right-clicking on it, select the ‚ÄúShare this location‚Äù item in the drop-down menu.  In the window that appears, you need to click on the Nokia Drop icon, then the Nokia Maps with the exact address will be opened in the phone. <br><br><h2>  So how is it? </h2><br>  As you can see, Nokia Drop is a useful thing for any web surfer.  This program is still in beta testing, so, despite its apparent completeness, it can still get some new features. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/d0746a7f/74b85828/bbf6d8ac/83b57595.jpg"><br><br>  By the way, what features would you like to see in Nokia Drop?  We will be happy to hear any ideas about the program.  Or maybe you have thoughts on how to use Notifications API in your programs if you are a developer? <br><br>  You can download Nokia Drop for devices running Symbian S60 5th and Symbian ^ 3 <a href="http://betalabs.nokia.com/apps/nokia-drop">on the Nokia Beta Labs website</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/129469/">https://habr.com/ru/post/129469/</a></p>
