HP includes computer, enterprise server, and service sales units. <br><br>  HP directors discussed both the details of the potential split scenario and the ability to keep the company intact, since the company seems to be slowly recovering, and its stock price is gaining momentum since it fell below $ 12 last November.  In January, stocks went above $ 17, and are now trading at around $ 16.50.

      If it turns out that HP can recover from recent troubles, separation may not happen.  However, HP shareholders are putting pressure on the board of directors because they are unhappy that the current stock price is much lower than the company is worth. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  On December 27, in a report to the Securities and Exchange Commission, HP announced that it was considering ‚Äúpossible alienation of assets and business that can no longer help us achieve our goals.‚Äù  However, according to Mashable sources, the board of directors did not form a special committee to consider the option of separation and currently has no plans to do so. <br><br>  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãparting with at least one of the divisions of HP is not new.  Former director Leo Apotheker decided in 2011 to separate from the company a division dealing with personal computers.  However, Apotheker was then forced to leave the company due to the fact that investors did not agree with his business decisions.  He was replaced by former eBay head Meg Whitman, who canceled the division of the division. <br><br>  The company then stated that personal computers are important for increasing purchasing power.  However, it is now assumed that individual HP units may cost more than together.  Analysts estimate that if HP were divided, the total value of its units could be more than $ 20 per share and up to $ 29 compared with the current 16.50. <br><br>  HP and other computer manufacturers have been affected by trends changing in favor of mobile devices and tablets.  However, HP has also not recovered from its own problems, including the ever-changing executives and from costly acquisitions. <br><br>  Most recently, HP's stock price plummeted as a result of the scandal with the statements of the British software company Autonomy, which HP bought in 2011 for about $ 12 billion.  HP said in November that it would write off almost $ 9 billion in connection with the company's problems. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/168447/">https://habr.com/ru/post/168447/</a></p>
