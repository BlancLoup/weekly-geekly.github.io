"</i> <i><br></i>  <i>(Philip K. Dick)</i> &lt;/ p align = "right"&gt; Efim Ostrovsky, a popular political consultant, believes that people‚Äôs behavior can be manipulated by incorporating relevant meanings into their minds.  This is called <b>Idea Placement</b> .  For example, in order to grow a new volitional and conscious business generation in Russian society, it is proposed to introduce the concept of ROS (Development of Public Relations) into Russian speech and use it instead of the concept of PR (Public Relations).  Accordingly, the "PR man" will sound like "master-ROS". <br><br>  Efim promotes his teaching through public lectures in different cities: <br><br><blockquote>  I recently wondered a lot when I found myself on a forum on the Net, where the latest book of Noam Chomsky was discussed, finding that his thesis about the controllability of the public consciousness is not obvious to many.  For me, it is absolutely obvious.  And I have only been talking about this for many years and I say that <b>social consciousness is nothing but an object of artificial creation</b> : you will model or model.  The forum was attended by people who had just discovered that a person is much less free than it seems, and that the set of its reactions and behavioral programs is exhausted and limited.  They lamented the loss of the natural ...

    <a name="habracut"></a>  I am from lecture to lecture attacking the myth of the natural. <br><br>  You are probably familiar with expressions like: ‚Äúbe natural‚Äù, ‚Äúnatural emotions‚Äù, ‚Äúnatural reactions‚Äù ... You‚Äôll see a sign that if you‚Äôre natural, you are supposedly sincere, free ... As if freedom is in naturalness ... <br><br>  But <b>naturalness is nothing more than natural artificial norms ‚Äî norms that were once created, planted on people</b> , intermingled over decades, centuries, and generations, many times intertwined, fading, and in this form stretching from generation to generation and organizing their lives.  They are followed, thinking that they are gaining freedom.  But in fact, they obey a powerful mechanistic rein, attracting them, driving them ... And they enjoy this lack of freedom, like a tourbillon in a watch would enjoy it, doing an unusually important thing, but remaining only a tourbillon ... <br><br>  Yes, at some instant we are faced with the fact that there is a certain factor that influences everything.  That there are not only <b>infrastructures</b> ‚Äî material systems supporting one or another activity ‚Äî and not only <b>anthropostructures</b> ‚Äî worlds of people ‚Äî but also <b>ultrastructures</b> built not from matter, not from atoms, but from signs.  ( <a href="http://www.gtmarket.ru/laboratory/publicdoc/gtmarket/2006/56">gtmarket.ru</a> ) </blockquote><br>  People who apply deep humanitarian knowledge in conjunction with marketing are called <b>humanitarian technologists</b> .  I do not like this term.  For the ‚Äútechnologists‚Äù, it sounds like just another eyewash, but the humanities simply don‚Äôt evoke any interest. <br><br>  Marketers, accustomed to numbers and perceiving the world as a set of target groups, hardly pay attention to some ephemeral "ultrastructures."  In turn, linguists who are ready to talk about semiotics, the science of signs, are not interested in marketing. <br><br>  In one of the interviews, Yefim is surprised that after the lectures, the journalists remain agitated only by the length of his hair and how much he spent on air tickets ... However, this does not surprise me at all.  People come to listen to a man who knows how to become the mayor of a rich region.  They are not interested in the Safe Wharf, the dictates of language and simulacra.  The Russian revolution, even, as Efim <a href="http://www.gtmarket.ru/laboratory/publicdoc/gtmarket/2006/484">says</a> , velvet, recognizes signs only when they are monetary. <br><br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/3427/">https://habr.com/ru/post/3427/</a></p>
