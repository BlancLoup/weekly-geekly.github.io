  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Reasoning about Colocation and VDS</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Write this note was inspired by the topic ‚ÄúWeb server for a couple of evenings‚Äù that recently appeared on Habr√©, which aroused great interest and numerous discussions.  A lot of webmasters wrote that they were just thinking of collecting / buying their own server for a project, followed by placement in a data center.  I will try to develop the topic of the inexpediency of placing a project on a colocation at the initial stages of development if there are no technical limitations. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  We will consider a typical situation when a project is created by a small group of developers with a limited budget. <br><br>  As an alternative to kolokeyshynu logical consider VDS (Virtual Dedicated Server) or VPS (Virtual Private Server), they offer almost all hosters.  The benefit of technology has greatly stepped up in recent years, and VDS has become really almost full-fledged Dedik.  At least for typical tasks, VDS fully emulates a dedicated server.

      <br>
      First of all, I wanted to point out the pros and cons of both systems. <br><br>  <strong>Colocation</strong> <br><br>  <em>Pros:</em> <br>  1. Full control over the hardware and system part. <br>  2. All computer resources belong only to you. <br>  3. The relative safety of the placement of information (in the presence of sensors opening the case, seals, etc.). <br>  4. Convenience of placing the initially large amount of information (tens, hundreds of gigabytes), as well as their subsequent addition (physical change / adding media) <br>  5. The price is significantly lower than that of dedicated servers. <br><br>  <em>Minuses:</em> <br><br>  1. The need to keep the minimum spare parts (hard drive, coolers, power supply) for the server.  And if something more serious fails?  Will find the means to recover all this quickly.  And if there was no backup? <br>  2. You may not get physical access to your server right away.  In some data centers, a pass must be issued per day and the time must be coordinated, plus weekends, holidays, etc.  This is all very critical when a breakdown occurred. <br>  3. You must independently provide backup data. <br>  4. You must independently update the system and applications. <br>  5. Possibility of upgrade, only if there are corresponding components on the market. <br><br>  <strong>Vds</strong> <br><br>  <em>Pros:</em> <br><br>  1. Care for the equipment performance rests entirely on the hosting. <br>  2. The minimum price compared with colocation and dedicated servers. <br>  3. Many hostings are backing up data, or for a preferential additional fee. <br>  4. System and standard applications updates hosting. <br>  5. Initially, you can pick up the current configuration (disk, memory, processor) and change it further to fit your needs. <br><br>  <em>Minuses:</em> <br><br>  1. It is impossible to use with very ‚Äúfine‚Äù hardware hardware settings. <br>  2. It is impossible to use a very exotic OS. <br>  3. The difficulty of downloading very large amounts of information. <br>  4. Limited resources compared to colocation and dedicated servers. <br>  5. Data security is comparable to dedicated servers (physical access to equipment is possible) <br><br>  Now compare prices.  Minimum prices for today are taken: <br><br>  <strong>Costs of collocation:</strong> <br><br>  1. Building / buying a 1U server - from $ 600 <br>  2. Installing OS (unix) $ 50-100 * <br>  3. Monthly fee - $ 70-100 <br>  4. Time to search for free space in the data center, server transportation. <br>  5. Some hosting providers charge for server installation (approximately $ 50) <br>  6. Server maintenance by the administrator * <br><br>  * Not taken into account if administration is done in-house. <br><br>  <strong>VDS Costs:</strong> <br><br>  1. Monthly fee - $ 10-30 <br>  2. Server maintenance by the administrator * <br><br>  With an acute budget deficit, the numbers and facts speak for themselves.  In this case, you can draw an analogy with off-line business.  Why rent an expensive office if there are no customers who will come there.  In the case of an online project, the same thing.  You need to be realistic and understand that the first half of the year, or even more, the VDS server will be enough for 100%.  So why pay more if there are no technical limitations? <br><br>  At the initial stages of development, the most important thing for a project is to declare itself, i.e.  as quickly as possible to reach your target audience.  I offer the money saved by hosting, let it be for advertising and promotion, and not to spend for a mysterious place in the data center rack.  Perhaps I missed something or made an inaccuracy.  Comments from your point of view are welcome. <habracut></habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/21456/">https://habr.com/ru/post/21456/</a></p>
