Or pass by.  However, emotional perception affects all aspects of our professional life, starting with the ability to sell, and ending with the ability to make useful contacts and the ability to conquer the career ladder.

      As the leadership expert Gordon Tredgold recently wrote for the Huffington Post: <br><blockquote>  We achieve career advancement thanks to our IQ, and they fire us because of low EQ ... </blockquote><br>  Get to <b>know</b> these extremely <b>simple life hacks</b> that will help you shape your emotional intelligence, and enjoy all its benefits. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">1. Keep cool</font> </h2><br>  Italian researchers have found that changes in body temperature, pulse rate and blood pressure are excellent indicators of stress that can affect our behavior in problem situations. <br><br>  To keep cool, take a walk and breathe in the fresh air or go to the bathroom and wash with cool water.  Do not let stress take over. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">2. Put yourself in the shoes of another person.</font> </h2><br>  <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/kak-uspeshnye-lyudi-spravlyayutsya-so-svoimi-toksichnymi-opponentami/">People can be a tremendous source of stress</a> .  Think about what causes you a negative emotional reaction?  Very often, the "provocateurs" are the opinions, judgments, demands and claims of other people. <br><br>  When a colleague, boss, investor or even a competitor gets on your nerves, try to look at the situation from his point of view.  Inspect it from all sides. <br><br>  Maybe you interpret the problem in your own way, or misunderstand his / her intentions?  Before you react, take a step back and think about the possible motives of the "enemy", <a href="http://testutor.ru/blog/pochemu-nekotorym-lyudyam-vezyot-namnogo-bolshe-chem-drugim/">try to understand what is important to others</a> . <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">3. Come up with plan B. And plan C</font> </h2><br>  Psychology Today defines emotional intelligence as "the ability to recognize and manage your own experiences and the emotions of others."  Will you be able to manage your own feelings well, if you are not always ready for what will happen next? <br><br>  Reactivity is a win-win recipe for emotionality.  Each time you make a decision, <a href="http://testutor.ru/blog/10-veshhej-nad-kotorymi-stoit-zadumatsya-prezhde-chem-brosit-rabotu/">consider its potential consequences</a> , even if some of them seem exaggerated. <br><br>  Imagine how you respond to each of them - so you will not be taken by surprise.  Suddenly, you will realize that even if the result does not match any of the predicted options, it will still be easier for you to cope with the situation and be guided on the go! <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">4. Be decisive.</font> </h2><br>  Fighting bad habits is the key to developing your emotional intelligence.  Do you usually use a passive dictionary to play it safe and protect yourself? <br><blockquote>  The form has been filled out ... New rules have been implemented ... and so on. </blockquote><br>  Passive language is weak by definition, no matter if you use it in writing or in speech.  Indeed, a passive voice is literally a story about what happened to you.  Is something happening to you, or are you yourself the force that shapes events? <br><br>  To demonstrate emotional intelligence, concentrate on highlighting actions that have already been done. <br><blockquote>  I filled out the form.  Our company has implemented a new policy. </blockquote><br>  Become the owner and show your emotional intelligence to customers, shareholders and the whole world. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">5. Use your emotional perception when communicating with others.</font> </h2><br>  A key aspect of emotional intelligence, as defined by Psychology Today, is your ability to influence the experiences of others.  When a tense and frightened colleague comes to you, do you calm him down, or does it get worse after talking to you?  It doesn‚Äôt matter what kind of relationship we are talking about ‚Äî personal or professional ‚Äî or even interaction with strangers. <br><br>  In any case, a lot about your emotional intelligence can tell <a href="http://testutor.ru/blog/9-kommunikativnyx-navykov-kotorymi-dolzhen-obladat-lyuboj-uspeshnyj-lider/">your treatment of other people and their influence on them</a> . <br><br>  Try to make everyone feel better after talking with you than before this meeting. <br><br>  Emotional intelligence is an incredibly valuable skill for all aspects of your personal and work life.  How do you rate your EQ?  Share your thoughts on emotional perception in the comments. <br><br>  PS We recommend another useful article on the topic of working on yourself - <a href="http://testutor.ru/blog/kak-nauchitsya-sebya-kontrolirovat-i-nachat-zhit-toj-zhiznyu-o-kotoroj-vy-mechtaete/">How to learn to control yourself and start living the life you dream about</a> . <br><br>  The author of the translation is Vyacheslav Davidenko, the founder of the <a href="http://testutor.ru/">TESTutor</a> company. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/300016/">https://habr.com/ru/post/300016/</a></p>
