Scientists have been able to save data in a quantum computing system for quite a long time - the researchers believe that we are standing one step away from creating a real quantum computer. <br><br>  Only six months ago, Lukin <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/digitaloctober/blog/144155/">told at his lecture in Moscow</a> how far we are from creating computers based on quantum effects, and today from his laboratory we received news ahead of our time.  It turned out that the future is already on the threshold. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e8a/6fb/b6e/e8a6fbb6e3b58fca6344af99d16580d4.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Lecture at Digital October</i>

      Under the leadership of Lukin, a group of scientists from Harvard University was able to create quantum bits that store information for about 2 seconds.  This is about 6 orders of magnitude longer than in previous experiments.  A separate feature of the created qubit was that it is able to work at room temperature. <br><br>  A quantum bit (or qubit) is the smallest element for storing information in a quantum computer.  According to researchers, the Harvard experiment made quantum computing systems one step closer. <br><br>  Most of the existing quantum systems are created on the basis of complex and expensive equipment, including installations that cool the system to absolute zero (-273 Celsius).  A group of scientists led by Harvard physics professor Mikhail Lukin used Mikhail Lukin diamonds grown under laboratory conditions. <br><br>  ‚Äú <i>What we have been able to achieve in terms of control is truly unprecedented</i> ,‚Äù commented Lukin. ‚Äú <i>We received a qubit at room temperature. We were able to write information into it and save it for a relatively long time. technical limitations. That is, it seems quite realistic to extend the qubit‚Äôs time to the clock. In this case, it becomes possible to implement real quantum computing systems</i> . " <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  In addition to quantum computers, Lukin envisions the creation of quantum payment systems that use quantum bits to encode information, and quantum computer networks with a new level of protection against intruders. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f34/bde/1fd/f34bde1fdd8939a0c03cc64f532bbc3b.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Mikhail Lukin, Georg Kuksko and Christian Latta in their laboratory.</i> <br><br>  ‚Äú <i>This study is an important step towards creating a practical quantum computer</i> ,‚Äù said Georg Kucsko, one of the research team members. ‚Äú <i>For the first time, we were able to create a simple system with an acceptable time interval for data storage</i> .‚Äù <br><br>  The basis for the experiment was found by the Lukin team several years ago, when scientists discovered that defects found in laboratory-grown diamonds (nitrogen-substituted vacancies, NV-vacancies) have the properties of individual atoms, in particular, spin.  With the help of a laser machine, scientists have learned to control the spin and recognize its polarization changing over time. <br><br>  Directly, these scientists recorded in a carbon-13 isotope, capable of maintaining their state for a long time.  However, on the other hand, isolation is a disadvantage - because it is difficult to ‚Äúget close‚Äù to it.  Scientists have found a brilliant solution: they could interact with the isotope with the help of neighboring impurities of another type. <br><br>  As a result of this interaction, the state of the carbon atom can be judged by the state of the NV vacancy, and the researchers were able to encode a bit of information into the spin of the atom. <br><br>  Encoding information in the back of carbon-13 atoms and reading it using an NV-vacancy is only a step on the way to a quantum computer.  Before they become practically useful, researchers must determine how to use the quantum property of atoms: the ability to exist in two states at the same time. <br><br><img src="http://icqt.org/news/ICQT2011/coffee.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Michael on the fingers explains the essence of his work</i> <br><br>  The ability to be in two states at the same time is a key principle of quantum computers.  Unlike traditional computers that write bits of information in zero or one states, quantum computers use atom properties to write two values ‚Äã‚Äãat once. <br><br>  According to the plan, this property will allow them to perform several calculations in parallel, which will make them much more powerful than traditional computers that perform operations in a certain sequence. <br><br>  The head of the research team that created the qubit working at room temperature is MIPT graduate Mikhail Lukin, professor of physics at Harvard University, co-director of the Harvard Center for Quantum Optics, co-director of the Harvard-MIT Center for Ultracold Atoms.  Participates in the international advisory council of the Russian Quantum Center, resident of the Skolkovo Foundation. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/147427/">https://habr.com/ru/post/147427/</a></p>
