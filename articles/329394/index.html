What exactly - we consider in our today's material. <br><br> <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/it-grad/blog/329394/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/7e3/c3b/47a/7e3c3b47ad1b4e7dbe7732a5473d5e32.jpg"></a> <a name="habracut"></a>  <i>/ Flickr / <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/jdhancock/6883176106/">jd hancock</a> / <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/">cc</a></i> <br><br><h2>  Smart cars </h2><br>  A car is a set of mechanical elements and electronic components connected by complex software.  And this software often becomes the basis of programmable services.  So automakers pay much attention to the development of technologies designed to help the driver to control the car.  For example, Jaguar Land Rover and Volvo are actively involved in these issues. <br><br>  The auto giant JLR is <a href="https://www.landrover.com/experiences/news/pothole-detection.html">developing a</a> technology that allows vehicles to locate road holes, broken well covers and storm systems and transfer the collected information to the cloud, from where other road users and road services can read it.  The decision will provide additional time for drivers to react and take the necessary measures to prevent a traffic accident. <br><br>  Another participant in the car market, <a href="http://volvocarchelny.ru/news1/modeli_volvo_90oj_serii_poluchili_novye_resheniya_bezopasnosti/">introducing</a> cloud technology, is Volvo.  She is also active in road safety issues.  We are talking about the warning functions on slippery parts of the road and (Slippery Road Alert) and the inclusion of alarms ahead of cars (Hazard Light Alert). <br><br>  ‚ÄúIn a modern Volvo, a lot of sensors are used.  We are confident that sharing information for the sake of safety, for example, about environmental conditions or dangerous parts of the road ahead, is a thoughtful and beneficial use of the information that car systems receive, ‚Äù <a href="http://volvocarchelny.ru/news1/modeli_volvo_90oj_serii_poluchili_novye_resheniya_bezopasnosti/">said</a> Peter Mertens, senior vice president of research at Volvo Cars.  ‚ÄúVolvo Cars is committed to creating a completely new type of system for safer traffic on the roads.‚Äù <br><br>  The Slippery Road Alert function raises driver awareness of slippery areas in which he is driving or which is only to be driven.  Information about such places enters the Volvo Cars database, from where it is broadcast to all cars approaching a dangerous section of the road. <br><br>  I would also like to note that organizations that are not initially associated with this industry are merging into the ‚Äúcloudy automotive industry‚Äù.  For example, last year, Alibaba officially <a href="https://life.ru/t/%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D1%2585%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B8/874357/umnyi_avtomobil_ot_alibaba_dostupien_dlia_priedzakaza">began</a> selling its vehicle.  This is a smart car Car'OS RX5, developed in conjunction with the Chinese automotive company Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation (SAIC). <br><br>  The company has equipped a smart car with an onboard computer running on the YunOS operating system.  Thanks to her, the car is able to interact with Internet services - for example, to automatically pay for parking or purchases at gas stations.  In addition, the car has four panoramic video cameras, supports voice commands and has an intelligent navigation system that, according to manufacturers, is capable of operating without GPS or a Wi-Fi signal. <br><br><h2>  Car production </h2><br>  Cloud technologies are ‚Äúused‚Äù not only by the cars themselves, but also used in their production.  As practice shows, the use of cloud technologies by automakers not only simplifies the solution of various tasks, but also significantly reduces costs. <br><br>  The well-known car company Tata Motors <a href="">optimized the</a> work of its employees, giving them the opportunity to interact with specialized portals rendered to the cloud.  With the help of these portals, fleet owners can track all vehicles in real time.  According to reports by Tata Motors, the use of web services in the cloud has a positive effect on the work of the company as a whole.  Cloud solutions help in a short time to implement new infrastructure projects at all stages of production: from planning to implementation. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe transition of Tata Motors to the cloud increased the speed of the services necessary for the business, including the availability of web hosting, the ability to use cloud storages and a video library, publish catalogs and much more,‚Äù <a href="http://iaas-blog.it-grad.ru/tata-motors-%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0%25D1%2587%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25B5-%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D1%2585%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B8-%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%2588%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8-%25D1%2581%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B5-%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5-%25D0%25B2-%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B2%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC-%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B7%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D0%25B5">said</a> Madhusudan Shekar, IT manager. Tata Motors solutions.  - Before using cloud solutions when launching new projects, the company often faced certain problems - the most serious of them was the constant lack of resources.  Now Tata Motors uses exactly as many resources as necessary. ‚Äù <br><br>  In addition to Tata Motors employees, the company's clients also use cloud-based tools.  Users have access to resources such as the Loyalty Portal and Telematics Portal. <br><br><h2>  Cloud services for car enthusiasts </h2><br>  The automotive industry is extremely versatile, and cloud services and solutions find their application not only in the workflows of manufacturing companies, but also developers of various applications.  For example, the ParknCloud solution based on Java, the Spring Framework and DHTMLX is <a href="https://dzone.com/articles/5-innovative-uses-for-cloud-technology">offered</a> on the SaaS model and runs from a cloud hosting provider.  The service is used to search for parking spaces and their payment in electronic form.  ParknCloud consists of two components: a mobile application installed on the client‚Äôs smartphone, and a web application for managing tariffs and parking spaces. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/797/3ba/524/7973ba524d22410aa13bb87214cd35d2.png" width="500"></div>  <i>Virtual Parking from the Cloud</i> <br><br>  Using the Parking Finder function, users find the closest available parking, and when they are determined with a place, the application paves the way to the destination.  The service is based on open APIs, so it is easily integrated into ready-made infrastructures. <br><br>  Another interesting example of the use of cloud services is vehicle diagnostics.  The MECH5 cloud platform for analyzing vehicle data provides a remote <a href="http://iaas-blog.it-grad.ru/%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D1%2580%25D1%2582%25D1%2583%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F-%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0-%25D0%25B8-%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0-%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B2%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BB%25D1%258F-%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B7-%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0">connection</a> to a vehicle, collecting and transmitting vehicle maintenance data, and also provides online access to maintenance logs. <br><br>  By accessing the vehicle's electronics, the MECH5 creates reports of vehicle health and detects minor problems, helping to prevent problems.  MECH5 connects and collects indicators of control units, analyzing the state of electronic systems (airbags, air conditioning systems, brakes, gear boxes). <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/241/de4/6d9/241de46d9d6a4128a50c2efbc63bbb90.jpg" width="500"></div>  <i>How MECH5 works from the cloud</i> <br><br>  The MECH5 connects to the vehicle via the VCI (Vehicle Communication Interface) interface and, using the X-Link application, establishes a secure connection to the cloud.
