Nevertheless, in the IT industry I have been working for money for more than ten years, and when I start to sell my experience, it turns out almost twenty (if you count the years of untiring at the institute and side earnings).  I am an IT infrastructure worker, and this topic is pretty close to me.  Therefore, I will share my thoughts about the search and cultivation of a sysadmin. <a name="habracut"></a>

      As the respected author of the previous topic correctly noted, the lack of personnel in IT is now unreal.  Finding a good specialist is damn difficult and trying to grow a specialist from scratch is not a bad idea. <br><br>  A little bit about hiring. <br><br>  Unlike the previous speaker, I am a categorical opponent of wages below the market.  The greatest principle of ‚Äúcostsaving means works works‚Äù (loosely translated - ‚Äúboth paid and for *; yacheno‚Äù) in IT is as strong as anywhere else.  What does an organization get for a small price list?  There are two options: <br>  1. Unqualified specialist who is unable to perform the expected work from him.  Do you really need a worthless person in a responsible position?  I do not. <br>  2. A qualified specialist who your competitors will soon wear out - there is more money in the country than people. <br><br>  Favorite counterargument of citizens who want to save office fzp often sounds like this: ‚Äúwe are going to teach a person!‚Äù <br>  A young ambitious person who understands perfectly well that they will not take him to this or that office, will be able to ask a question in order of clarification: show me the curriculum for subjects and number of hours, the list of teachers, their achievements, show the price for training, and prove to me, that your service is worth my failure in the bubble (in fact, you charge me for my tuition money - show me what kind of powder you sell me). <br>  I assure you, except for a miserable bleating about invaluable experience, this young man will not hear anything. <br>  We'll nail the nail in the coffin: invaluable work experience is <strong>always</strong> acquired.  From the first day of work in the organization and at the extreme, it should not be paid for. <br><br>  Nevertheless, it is possible to grow a valuable frame, and not to spend a lot of money. <br><br>  First of all, it should be understood that a person without work experience is a person without work experience.  And you will pass on your knowledge to him.  Just forget that it costs money.  They are not ready to pass on their knowledge for free - the shortage of coaches is now as fierce, marching there to teach for money. <br>  I quite willingly share my knowledge with colleagues for that. <br><br>  It should also be understood that an unskilled specialist is unlikely to need you 40 hours a week.  And agree on hourly wages (of course, stipulating that consuming coffee and cigarettes instead of productive work is not the best way to wind up a counter of hours worked) <br>  Yes, and pay for the market!  Do not pay you - pay your competitor.  You want to save money, there is an unified social tax, there are deductions in the Pension Fund, there are paid vacation and sick leave - and there are ways to completely not pay it legally and save precious loot. <br><br>  Thirdly, it is obvious that you do not need such a person on staff.  Therefore, do not take a person to the state, it will cost you less, and a person will have a carrot: show yourself from the good side - take to the state. <br><br>  As for the salary figures, then everything is quite conditional, and I am not ready to call universal recipes.  My calculation now is this: a sane sysadmin costs 40-50 tr. In Moscow.  per month, i.e.  hour of work - 250 rubles.  We take into account that a person cannot be available 8 hours a day (the eight-hour availability of a specialist is a product that costs money itself), does not have sufficient qualifications, does not own the problems of your office - and we find that the working hour of an evening student at A 4-hour working day 5 days a week should cost 100-150 rubles.  Or, in other words, about 16 tr.  per month. <br>  I note <strong>immediately</strong> , but not after a couple of years of immaculate service. <br>  Yes, I am aware that any student wants to receive from 50 tr.  immediately, but alas, he has nothing to sell for the money. <br><br>  Of course, for this money you can afford the luxury of picking a person, and not taking the first one. <br><br>  So, how to lure a man, <br>  1. Offer him a market salary. <br>  2. Offer him a job according to his powers. <br>  3. Offer him a suitable work schedule. <br>  4. Explain to him what his salary is made of now, what will not be in it, what will appear in it later. <br>  5. Show the prospects for professional growth. <br>  6. Do not lie in anything: when the truth is revealed, you will lose either the face or the person. <br><br>  and how to keep it: <br>  1. Train, give him your knowledge, and do not pretend that someone owes you for them <br>  2. Let's work on the strengths (do not mess around, but do not overload) <br>  3. If a person develops - put more complex tasks. <br>  4. Communicate as an equal - you work together, the intern should not feel as if he is inferior <br>  5. Trust him (do not trust the person - part with him, do not part - trust) <br>  6. Follow the promise <br>  7. There is a reason and there is an opportunity - let's get more than promised <br>  8. Finally, if it becomes possible to take a person to the state - take <br><br>  And remember: a greedy employer always forges staff for another office. <br>  And while he sits with cheap, but disloyal and unqualified staff. <br>  Anyone who does not spare money and effort on the staff, has a stable and well-coordinated team. <br><br>  What everyone wants. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/20869/">https://habr.com/ru/post/20869/</a></p>
