Vystavochnaya Metro Station (formerly Business Center) <br><br>  Since the stand is still being prepared, and I want to show beautiful pictures, I will say a few words about the projectors themselves, I will share 3D models that we agreed with the stand developer, and briefly tell you about the main features of the installation, especially interactive and entertaining. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h2>  Real, real 4K </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/1u/sn/jc/1usnjc-rs-xzdegxiz68fz9ga50.jpeg"><br><br>  Epson EB-L20000U and Epson EB-L12000Q - installation projectors with a laser light source, which will go on sale in 2019, will be demonstrated for the first time in Russia.  I will tell you more about them as soon as I have all the information on my hands to add on <a href="http://www.epson.ru/">epson.ru</a> . <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Epson EB-L12000Q</b> is the first 3LCD projector on the market with a brightness of 12,000 lumens with a <i>physical resolution of 4K</i> (3840 x 2160).  The main and key point is that the projector, like all others under the Epson brand, is built on 3LCD technology.  Those.  it has <u>three</u> LCD-matrix with a resolution of 4K!  All the <a href="https://habr.com/company/epson/blog/401923/">advantages of 3LCD</a> on site plus 4K UHD support - in one device. </li><li>  <b>Epson EB-L20000U</b> is a lightweight and compact model in a segment of projectors popular with rental companies with a brightness of 20,000 lumens and WUXGA resolution ( <i>not</i> native 4K, but with support for <a href="http://www.epson.ru/technology/projection/1158311/">4K Enhancement</a> technology, which, according to our installers, is still in the majority installations).  The ‚Äúyounger‚Äù brother of this model recently for the first time for Epson <a href="https://habr.com/company/epson/blog/423885/">took part in a large-scale installation at the ‚ÄúCircle of Light 2018‚Äù in Moscow</a> . </li></ul><br>  Both projectors are equipped with a built-in camera that allows remote diagnostics, and can also be used to work with Epson Professional Projection Tool to set up multi-projector installations and work with functions such as stitching and projection mapping. <br><br>  Well, now, actually, about the stand and what can be seen on it. <br><br>  The stand is divided into "zones".  Each has its own characteristics. <br><br><h2>  Front office </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/lw/fn/br/lwfnbrj9bzvcd1sk0qbi-za7vqa.jpeg"><br><br>  Performs the following tasks: <br><br><h4>  Information and Navigation </h4><br>  You can use not only the classic Digital Signage system that broadcasts news and events of the company, but virtually any surface.  For example, an invitation to go to the meeting room is displayed at the visitor directly at the reception desk. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vb/9z/vk/vb9zvk9j-ymjvumswsxgfww4j9m.jpeg"><br><br><h4>  Display advertising and presentations </h4><br>  Reception can tell a lot about products, values ‚Äã‚Äãor technologies, form an intra-corporate spirit.  We will show these functions with the help of the installations ‚ÄúHall of Fame‚Äù (Corporate Museum) and realbook, as well as zones with additional reality points and object mapping for watches (Retail), which are described below. <br><br><h4>  Entertaining </h4><br>  <i>Where are no entertainment!</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/8s/xu/qj/8sxuqjkvlm6on1qh7q2utjfsm7y.jpeg"><br><br>  Good old classic Tetris, but <i>with gesture control</i> .  Demonstrates how the same item can carry not only the function of partitions and decoration of the room, but also entertain visitors, or display some useful information (company news, stock reports, etc.) <br><br>  In addition to the game there are a couple of interactive areas: <br><br><h4>  Hall of Fame </h4><br>  In the shelving on the right are items that symbolize various projects or achievements of companies.  For example, a Spartak soccer ball or a model of a T-34 tank standing in front of the entrance to the Victory complex.  To learn more about the project, you need to put the item on the special box under the screen. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/yi/fs/ce/yifscegob1z_fqrdk0hzjxtkzto.jpeg"><br><br><h4>  Generative graphics </h4><br>  On the wall to the right of the reception is a generative graphic that reacts to the movement of the visitor heading for the counter. <br><br><h4>  Real book </h4><br>  Interactive book with real page turning.  Here are the most interesting projects of the company. <br><br><h2>  Back office </h2><br>  The left part of the stand is also divided into functional areas: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/i5/pn/48/i5pn48uw8ksadw5ownazdfpswzs.jpeg"><br><br><h4>  Study </h4><br>  The modern office of an office employee is interactive, there is a minimum of physical objects and ‚Äúdust collectors‚Äù in it, various possibilities are realized by technical means. <br><br>  Provides features that allow you to change the appearance of various areas.  For example, you can choose the surroundings and the view outside the window to suit your mood.  All items on this modern table are projection: phone, notepad, drawings / photos, etc. More <br>  no mess and dust on the table! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/on/2h/ap/on2hapue1tcqyyz9r9hdnsehbrg.jpeg"><br><br><h4>  Small negotiation </h4><br>  This is a place to relax and work together.  It is easily transformed to any tasks and the desired number of participants in the meeting.  The table transformer allows to collect practically any necessary configuration.  <b>Moreover, the content responds to changes and adapts to the new modification.</b> <br><br>  In this way, a small meeting room and an office can be transformed by simple permutations of cubes into a conference room, a training class or a cinema in general! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/h_/rb/0o/h_rb0oggdhuakyuf48dl-dpozow.jpeg"><br><br><h2>  Waiting for you! </h2><br>  Finally, I will share my own opinion: this year's stand is <i>simply unrealistically cool</i> .  We have never had <b>such</b> interactive installations.  I promise that there <u>will be</u> something to see and where to say "Wow!" <br><br>  In addition, given that the installation is very complex, I still recommend seeing it <i>tomorrow or the day after tomorrow (October 24-25)</i> , and not on the 26th, because  On the 26th, it will function for up to three to four days, after which the complex dismantling process will begin. <br><br>  We are waiting for you at the S-26 booth at the ISR 2018 exhibition. Entrance to the exhibition is <i>free</i> at registration through the <a href="https://www.isrussia.ru/visitors/registration2018/">website</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/427383/">https://habr.com/ru/post/427383/</a></p>
