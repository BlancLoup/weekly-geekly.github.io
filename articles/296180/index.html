Testimonials are a great way to show impressions of this experience, and our community writes over one million reviews every month.  People write reviews to express gratitude or give feedback, and they also read reviews to learn more about people with whom they have not met.  Therefore, we are confident that reviews should be as timely, honest and as relevant to reality as possible, and we are pleased to tell you about some improvements in the work of the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/CouchSurfing">Couchsurfing</a> feedback system. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  1. If you entered someone or entered someone, we will directly ask you about your impressions, instead of waiting until you yourself remember that you need to write a review.  You will see these ‚Äúreminders‚Äù only if you are deducted via Couchrequest or Public Trip. <br>  <i>(Couchrequest is a special type of address message CS in which you specify exact information about the time of your arrival at the place of registration, Public Trip is the same message, but for the whole community, note.)</i>

      Guest Response or Wiscus must accurately reflect the experience of the meeting.  We can not remind you to write a review if we do not know what you were planning to meet, so when you plan to fit in with someone, use Couchrequest to clarify the details and arrival dates. <br><br>  If you have agreed on a meeting not through Couchrequest, you will not be able to leave feedback on behalf of the Guest or the List, but you can still do it on behalf of the Friend. <br><br>  2. You have 14 days to write a review on behalf of the Guest / Applist.  Reviews will appear in profiles either at the same time, when both participants write a review, or after fourteen days. <br><br>  Reviews must be honest and timely, so we want to give you the opportunity to write a review without looking at what another member wrote about you.  We also do not want to admit the possibility that the review was written too late, when the impressions of the meeting will be erased from your memory. <br><br>  3. You can no longer delete or edit a review. <br><br>  All reviews, including those written on behalf of a Friend (or Other) should be a ‚Äúphoto‚Äù of your communication experience, and not a continuation affair.  We want to remove the changeable nature of feedback to give other Couch Surfers the certainty that when they read a review, they see an exact reflection of the participants' impressions of this list. <br><br>  If someone fit you many times (or you fit someone many times) you can write a few reviews about him. <br><br>  4. Now you can provide confidential feedback. <br><br>  There are situations when you may want to send some additional information to our security team for information.  This confidential feedback option gives you the opportunity to report something about your stay that you would not want to publicize. <br><br>  We are enthusiastically engaged in improving the accuracy and timeliness of feedback.  In future releases, we also plan profile changes that are designed to further enhance your experience in real life.  We are waiting for feedback. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/296180/">https://habr.com/ru/post/296180/</a></p>
