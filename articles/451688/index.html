  <section class="page js-page"><h1>From programmer to businessmen</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Now I am quite seriously telling you the real truth, how to make your dream come true and become free and independent, to forget about the vile duty to get up at 7 am to work, buy your own private plane and fly away from here to where it is warmer.  I firmly believe that it can make every sane adequate citizen.  In fact, everything is simple.  It is necessary to carry out three simple steps, and the goal will certainly be achieved. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>1. Meet people who share your aspirations.</b> <b><br></b> <br>  Everything is very simple.  Find new friends will help your old friends.  To do this, bring them together for a cheerful drink of alcohol, singing songs, riding dota or whatever you usually do with them ... Look at them very carefully.  Remember every moment of time that you have irretrievably missed in order to get this instead of achieving your dreams.  Silently say goodbye to these people and quietly leave the party.  And never meet them again for spending time together.  Carefully keep their image in your memory and avoid anyone who is a little like them. <br><br>  Note!  To share aspirations is not to rant on a topic, as it would be good.  It means to strive, to move in a given direction.  And if you are going up, do not stand next to those who cling to you to pull them down!  In the end, not only will they not allow you to do what you have planned, but by filling in the entire part of the space-time continuum around you they will not allow new people to appear in your life.  Especially if you are an introvert.  So, without this, nothing will come of it.  Wept - and forward!

      <b>2. Start moving towards your goals.</b> <b><br></b> <br>  Everything is absolutely simple.  You give up all the things you were doing before, and you start doing things that you really should do, in strict accordance with the Eisenhower matrix.  Trying to do this quickly does not make sense: even with all your endeavors it will turn out slowly.  Awfully medeleennnoooooo.  Because there will be a lot of cases.  So, we throw absolutely all of what you liked to do before (including those entertainment with friends from the first paragraph).  We give up work, we give up entertainment, we give up communication with people who eat time.  We reserve only strategically important activities: bicycle, pool and other movements that support life in your body.  If there is no work at all, we leave it at a minimum. <br><br>  <b>3. Practice self-education.</b> <b><br></b> <br>  Everything is amazingly simple.  You just need to learn a new profession: business.  How many years did it take to master the previous one?  And how many years did it take to form a mentality that led to the acquisition of a previous profession?  This all needs to be replaced.  That is, you need to learn again.  It takes about the same time.  I hope you have not turned 30?  Okay, just kidding.  40 is also quite a suitable age.  There is even a small chance to retire on time!  So, we start to google books on business, autobiographies of businessmen, speeches of successful people, and so on in this spirit.  We are looking for working methods and templates, we eliminate slag, we introduce into life useful things. <br><br>  Here, in general, that's all.  What do you think, I will tell you how to sift a successful startup?  Stupidity.  The point is not in the programs that you write for the computer.  The thing is in the program that is in your head!  We were all born with arms, legs, head and ears.  We all have approximately equal physical capabilities.  And even if you were born in the wrong place, then physically moving to another place is not such a difficulty.  <b>The hardest thing to change your behavior, and start to commit those actions that will lead you to the desired result.</b> <br><br>  And then the question arises: do you need it?  No seriously!  After all, you know what to do, but for some reason you will not do it today, not tomorrow, not in a year, nor in life.  I think the whole problem is motivation.  More precisely, in its frequent absence.  Maybe you just do not see yourself where you think you would like to go?  This is a big and difficult problem.  We are all driven by motivation, often often completely incomprehensible where and why.  That is, to stop moving in a circle, in a spiral, or stagnate, you need to have the motivation to change the motivation.  And it is not.  How to be?  Once upon a time, a long time ago, a comrade (who might recognize himself in these lines) gave me useful advice: go to the book market and buy several books on the topic ‚Äúhow to create a business‚Äù, and which authors do not matter, because their main essence is the same: motivation.  It worked, for which I am still very grateful.  It was a great kick in the ass and charge to start.  After reading three books on how to become a millionaire, I stopped wandering around, and became, figuratively, rushing like crazy.  True, again in a circle, but much faster!  In the end, it enhances the action of centrifugal force, which in itself is quite good. <br><br>  Another question is what to do.  No, everything that I wrote above is understandable, but then what?  How to start a particular business, how to accomplish it, how not to lose money, and, last but not least, not to plunge?  One can think about this question for a long time.  This is also a kind of circling.  How to get out of it?  Yes, just start doing something.  Get up after each fall, no matter how many times you fell.  Draw conclusions and try again.  The main thing is that any thinking should be given an adequate time frame, after which a decision is made.  You can not think forever, endlessly look for an idea in a million.  We simply do not have so much time to think so much.  Moreover, while you are not doing anything, new thoughts will not enter your head.  Therefore - do, do, and do again.  And be persistent and persistent.  Any undertaking, if it did not turn out to be completely delusional, should be brought to some reasonable finale, so that the assumption would turn into confident knowledge.  And then try to take advantage of it - it is also very useful.  It happens that people start something, and then they quit because it didn‚Äôt work.  Time passes, and new brilliant ideas appear, and things are no longer there.  And, if a project still turns out to be worthwhile, you will know about it only when you implement it.  And I will tell you in secret that any sane business in which you have invested your soul is doomed to life, because you create value, and the value is always worth something, and, as a rule, more than fakes.  And in the end, no matter what happens, you get an experience that you do not drink.  Experience will always take you out.  In the end, everything is not as scary as it seems.  I saw a lot of successful projects started by completely ordinary people with completely unremarkable skills.  And what is surprising: while others dreamed, they worked hard, and for several years they received enviable results.  <b>They just worked.</b>  <b>Simply.</b>  <b>WORKED.</b> <br><br>  A few more tips for last: <br>  <u>Business is people</u> , it must always be remembered and taken into account.  Creating a business you create relationships between people - no more and no less.  Therefore, always think with whom you cooperate and whom you hire, build honest relations for the future, this will allow you to become overgrown with useful connections and strengthen your position.  Learn to find a common language with people, it is very important. <br>  <u>Read books</u> .  Do not want to read - watch a video on this topic, catch inspiration and then read.  Treat books like chests of gold.  Each (good) book will give you a very valuable knowledge, in fact - this is someone else's experience, reducing your path for years.  Maybe even some of my previous articles will help. <br>  <u>Do not be afraid that something will not work</u> .  And do not worry, everything will be as horrible!  Just like that.  Over time, when confidence comes, you will appreciate all the nonsense that you did, and understand what it gave you.  <b>The only thing you do not appreciate is the time you have spent not to try to do anything at all.</b> <br><br>  PS: Friends!  All the tips here are not secrets.  There is no magic pill.  What is written in every article and book is the most important thing to know.  I do not sell courses and trainings, I do not write books on this topic.  All the information provided is completely free, and for additional information I refer you to numerous authors of books and articles on this topic.  And most importantly, do not forget: everyone can, but not everyone will.  Do not worry, 144 million aircraft will not be needed.  Yes, and he, to be honest, to anything;) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/451688/">https://habr.com/ru/post/451688/</a></p>
