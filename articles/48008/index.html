  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The birth of an idea. We force events.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <i>This article is a continuation of the article The <a href="http://laberso.habrahabr.ru/blog/47998/">birth of ideas.</a></i>  <i><a href="http://laberso.habrahabr.ru/blog/47998/">How to invent a bicycle.</a></i> <br><br>  Imagine a situation where we need blood-from-nose to come up with a fresh creative idea.  This happens periodically.  For example, we have a free week and we decided to spend time with benefit.  Submitted?  Let's start. <br><br>  The basis again will be taken abstract objects that we choose completely random.  For the purity of the experiment, it will be the most banal things that are in almost every home: an eraser, a pencil and a sheet of paper.  I emphasize that this method is applicable not only to material things.  In the same way you can think of something virtual.  Go. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Let's start with the ‚ÄúPaper Sheet‚Äù object.  It would seem the most common thing in which there is nothing unusual.  How to "pump" it?  What can you think of?  Let us draw a table in which we single out for ourselves three key points: what, for whom, and why. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      In this case, ‚Äúwhat‚Äù is a piece of paper.  It's all clear.  Let's look further.  We will start from the point ‚Äúwhy‚Äù, because the object is so banal that it is not difficult to find a consumer.  Why can our superfood paper be used?  Sketch in the table: <br><br><ul><li>  Printers, copiers. </li><li>  For handwriting in schools and institutes </li><li>  Service forms, notifications </li><li>  Flyers, advertisements </li><li>  Tickets, flyers. </li></ul><br><br>  Let us dwell on these points.  Let us single out the common features of these categories of objects: the first three points are, as a rule, A4 format, have serious content, and the last two are usually of a small format and are filled with advertising content.  We continue to make our table.  Now we will try to paint for whom these two groups are needed. <br><br><ul><li>  The first group is serious people, fairly conservative, some of the papers have a standard from which it is impossible to depart. </li><li>  The second group is Advanced Youth, Party People, People Interested in Information, or Potential Victims of Promotions. </li></ul><br><br>  See what happens?  The first group itself almost falls out of further development, since there are many restrictions on the change in the object.  In fact, this does not mean that nothing can be invented for them, it‚Äôs just that we are now solving a puzzle on the rate of birth of an idea and we don‚Äôt have much time.  In addition, the introduction of creativity in this group will be markedly complicated, but we do not need it.  But the most important thing is that the second group has much more funds, which will allow, provided the implementation of our idea is cheap, to get more guaranteed profits in the future.  In general, we move on. <br><br>  What do leaflets, announcements, tickets and flyers have in common?  The answer is one - mass distribution from hand to hand.  These papers are transmitted by contact and carry information that must be read by the user.  Read ... Be sure to read ... It seems we are hooked on the idea, but it is still too transparent.  Push elbows on.  All these papers get, are used and transferred in public places, on the streets.  Tickets and flyers, as a rule, are in use in clubs, theaters, cinema halls.  We are already somewhere nearby. <br><br>  Let's draw a line and discard the information slag that has accumulated as a result of our reasoning: we have a youth audience mixed with potential advertising victims who carry some paper with them, which they must read when they are in a public place, club, theater ... Again, this is ‚ÄúRead‚Äù .  And what, strictly speaking, can prevent us from reading the text from paper, and even in a club / theater / cinema?  Feel it?  Childbirth is close!  The correct answer is darkness!  We need to solve the problem with the backlight paper and the whole business.  How?  Let's say we make a paper that will glow in the dark around the edges.  Having bent a luminous angle to the text that needs to be read, we somehow or other will see something.  Thus, you can highlight ads at porches, flyers, tickets for parties and other papers, which should always be visible in the dark.  Conveniently?  Sure.  Realizable?  We are considering a hypothetical example, so yes.  That's all!  During the writing of the article (about 30 minutes), we gave birth to an absolutely from scratch idea for further feeding, using the simplest subject in everyday life. <br><br>  Further, I will give only data on the remaining two subjects.  Perhaps, what is described here already exists, but we do not pay attention to it yet.  We are the main process. <br><br><blockquote>  <strong>Eraser:</strong> <br><br>  <em>What for?</em> <br><br><ul><li>  Drawing work </li><li>  Drawing </li><li>  School supplies </li><li>  Office office </li></ul><br><br>  <strong>We unite on the general signs:</strong> Drawing work + Drawing (an irreplaceable subject), School accessories + Office (not the most important subject).  We stop at the first paragraph. <br><br>  <em>For whom?</em> <br><br>  Artists, illustrators, draftsmen, ordinary people to erase sketches. <br><br>  <strong>We think: It is</strong> used when it is necessary to erase something that is badly drawn.  All draw.  Use drawing tools.  Create drawings.  Drawings.  Paint. <br><br>  <strong>Idea:</strong> Eraser that can draw.  How?  Two one corner on the eraser consists of a red material that leaves a flat red stripe on paper, if they hold.  It is used for quick marking on paper, underline, strikethrough. <br><br>  <strong>Pencil:</strong> <br><br>  <em>What for?</em> <br><br><ul><li>  Drawing </li><li>  Drawing work </li><li>  School supplies </li><li>  Office office </li><li>  Ear picking </li><li>  Chewing </li></ul><br><br>  <strong>We unite on the general signs:</strong> Drawing + Drawing work (the main tool), School accessories + Office office (it is necessary), Ear picking + Chewing (Just for fun).  I settled on the latter, since it is a serious tool for those who work with it and it is unlikely that they will want to see changes in it. <br><br>  <em>For whom?</em> <br><br>  Schoolchildren, ordinary people as a subject on the table, creative people <br><br>  <strong>We think: It is</strong> necessary on the desk, on the table in the quality of "that was."  It is not always used as intended.  Most often for pampering.  For fun.  Entertainment. <br><br>  <strong>Idea:</strong> <br><br>  1. Strategic pencil, which is only a third pencil with a movable mechanism.  Bending it, it takes a T-shape.  The pencil part becomes a handle, and the second half is a spitting tube with chewed paper. <br><br>  2. Chewing pencil.  Either edible, or "Mom" beeps when you grip it with your teeth.  Toy in general. <br><br></blockquote><br><br>  In general, as we see it is quite simple.  I do not argue, for this you need to have a certain mindset and fantasy, but, believe me, nothing supernatural is required.  You just need to correctly, using the method of exceptions, evaluate the target user and the niche need of the subject.  I can say that I use this method constantly and he never let me down. <br><br>  _________ <br>  <i>This article is a continuation of the article The <a href="http://laberso.habrahabr.ru/blog/47998/">birth of ideas.</a></i>  <i><a href="http://laberso.habrahabr.ru/blog/47998/">How to invent a bicycle.</a></i> <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/48008/">https://habr.com/ru/post/48008/</a></p>
