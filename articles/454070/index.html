      Or is it time yet?  And if it's time, then how to choose a monowheel for commuting to work? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I will express a number of considerations on a given topic, based on my experience of running several thousand kilometers on different types of electric vehicles (of course, far from the thought that the following is some absolute truth). <br><br>  The first thing to decide on is to use the monowheel for commuting to work?  Like any transport, the monowheel has its own niche and its limitations.  Everything is relative, so ... <br><br><h2>  Legs </h2><br>  For me - the ideal transport for moving over a distance of up to 4 km in both directions.  Well, up to 5. <br><br><h2>  Scooter </h2><br>  Used a few months when the distance home-work-home was 7 km.  Very good option, easy, compact, when traveling a large number of muscles is involved. <br><br>  Of the minuses: <br><br><ul><li>  hard to ride against the wind; </li><li>  it is unpleasant to go on a tile; </li><li>  autumn could not pick up clothes, either hot or cold. </li></ul><br>  If there are a lot of tiles along the way, you can consider the option with ‚Äúinflated‚Äù tires, for example, a domestic manufacturer, a <a href="https://vk.com/ptahascooters">PTAX scooter</a> : <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1c3/23f/078/1c323f07811ae8212d9ca5f1b6f69167.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  This model costs a certain amount of money, but, in my opinion, it costs adequately (although I have not personally tried it). <br><br>  In general, a scooter is an excellent choice for trips over a distance of up to 8 km per day along good paths, especially if you do not need to enter another transport. <br><br><h2>  Electric Scooter </h2><br>  I have used and still sometimes use the e-twow booster model, this is a time-tested "classic".  For which I appreciate: <br><br><ul><li>  relatively lightweight; </li><li>  instantly mastered, you can give the guests; </li><li>  in Russia you can buy any parts; </li><li>  brake only recuperative and back foot (never used), no v-brake to you, disks and pads - minimalism; </li><li>  there is cruise control; </li><li>  You can kick with your foot if you need to burn calories or something went wrong (there was never ‚Äúwrong‚Äù). </li></ul><br>  Used almost year-round (for winter trips it is necessary to change the rear wheel to an inflatable one ( <a href="https://www.micro-scooter.ru/collection/kategoriya/product/koleso-dlya-Flex-Air-200-mm">example</a> ), otherwise it will be ‚Äúbrought in‚Äù): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wp/4m/ei/wp4meimiz-exljhwd9engmngn94.jpeg"><br><br>  When should I prefer a monowheel (my criteria, of course): <br><br><ul><li>  trips more than 10 km in both directions along good sidewalks / walkways;  on the monowheel, the static position oppresses; </li><li>  no time / desire to learn; </li><li>  it seems that the monowheel is more dangerous; </li><li>  for a ride in the winter (agree, exotic) on an electric scooter is somehow safer.  In the courtyard, I drove my sleigh with a monowire on the rolled snow without problems, much to the delight of all parties, but I would not risk taking the route with ice. </li></ul><br><h2>  Bicycle </h2><br>  My current choice on relatively long trips.  Now the distance home-work-home is 16 km, on the mono-wheel you can, of course ... But no, not for me - and so the work is sedentary, and then there is an hour to "defend". <br><br>  I go again, all year round: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qp/qq/1u/qpqq1u7g6d0ifk5jk2lxatnaeu0.jpeg"><br><br><h2>  Monowheel </h2><br>  The ideal transport for ‚Äúhopping‚Äù a total distance of up to 12 km per day.  With great pleasure I use it when I go to work to work - a few kilometers ‚Äúbullet‚Äù on a dirt road to the train station, then also a few kilometers from the subway to work. <br><br>  Significantly surpasses everything else (except the legs) in compactness, terrain and ease of transportation in transport.  It is much more pleasant to drive at relatively short distances than on other types of transport - soft, stylish, minimalist. <br><br>  I do not like to drive far, sometimes my legs become numb, and in general, I think a bicycle is more useful.  But this is mine, personal.  There are people who roll tens of kilometers easily. <br><br><h2>  Monowheel - Selection Criteria </h2><br>  The main thing that should make a start when choosing a monowheel: <br><br><ul><li>  Battery capacity; </li><li>  overall reliability </li></ul><br>  It may seem strange that we are talking about capacity, and not about power, but these things are connected - the more batteries used in a wheel, the more peak power the wheel is able to develop.  This becomes especially important when the battery is very low. <br><br>  In principle, you can ride on a wheel with a small capacity / power, but you need to clearly understand the consequences.  When driving on the mono-wheel, one point of support is used, intelligence <br>  the wheels are constantly and very sophisticatedly seeking balance.  Finding a balance in some cases may require a very large energy release.  Such cases, for example, include an unexpected encounter of obstacles in the form of a recess or protrusion on the asphalt, sharp acceleration and braking.  And if the last two cases can be somehow controlled, the first is a constant threat.  Thus, the capacity and power does not happen much. <br><br>  Another important factor that directly depends on the battery capacity is the range.  Manufacturers indicate the values ‚Äã‚Äãobtained in conditions that are very far from objective reality.  To estimate what will actually be, you can use <a href="http://darknessproduction.com/DistanceCalculator/">the mileage calculator</a> .  In my experience - very similar to the truth.  When calculating, please note that: <br><br><ul><li>  add weight to your weight; </li><li>  you need to select the mode ‚Äúdrive with acceleration / decceleration‚Äù. </li></ul><br>  For wheels, which are considered in this article, the results are as follows: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/2f/pt/f5/2fptf5yaqbw3gqlfeqwaxqoqhse.jpeg"><br><br>  If there is a desire to immerse more deeply into the topic of power, I recommend the one-of-a-kind article <a href="https://airwheel.ru/2017/10/27/test-monokoles-na-dinostende/">Test monowheels on the dyno</a> . <br><br>  As for the rather vague "reliability".  There are quite a lot of nuances in the monowheel, both ‚Äúiron‚Äù and ‚Äúsoft‚Äù, which affect safety.  In general, it is rather difficult to identify and solve them, and I hope that this would be taken into account in some cheap noname I would not.  I have already owned models of two companies for several years - KingSong-14D and Inmotion V8, there are no complaints about reliability, so I‚Äôll briefly go through other models of these companies. <br><br><h2>  KingSong KS14M 174Wh </h2><br>  174 Wh, 12.80 kg, 25.000 ‚ÇΩ <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/60b/506/f61/60b506f6164741d186158c605c51cf01.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  A good choice for light girls and children.  In principle, the "guys" can also be careful to drive, but the mileage will be 6-9 km. <br><br><h2>  Inmotion V5F </h2><br>  320 Wh, 550 W ,, 11.9 kg, $ 37.900 <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/626/b05/652/626b056529fcb0db86c50f99cba7dc9b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Power here, oddly enough, is lower than that of the KS14M, but the capacity seems to me to be a higher priority parameter.  A great option for light and medium weight.  The video is a discontinued model V5: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hmPHJFsaiho" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><h2>  KingSong KS14D 420Wh </h2><br>  420 Wh, 800 W, 13.6 kg, 45.000 ‚ÇΩ <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4a3/f34/338/4a3f343389226aa7fc3df7bdc678f838.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  I traveled for a while, then gave it to the child.  My 100 kg pulls perfectly, but at a distance of ~ 12 km.  Then begins annoyingly peep and slow down.  For my own safety. <br><br><h2>  InMotion V8 </h2><br>  480 Wh, 800 W, 13.5 kg, 55.000 ‚ÇΩ <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8db/41d/c9a/8db41dc9ab8b8c4bd55cfda7d056884c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  It is my choice.  100 kg of weight confidently drive through 20 km, made firmly, monolith, two handles.  The only downside is the price.  But the ideal is not cheap. <br><br><h2>  KingSong KS14DS 840Wh </h2><br>  840 Wh, 800 W, 15.5 kg, 62.000 ‚ÇΩ <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ba3/a37/934/ba3a37934af562109693d70e9654326c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The long-range version of the KS14D.  Sense, in my terms, does not have.  It is better to take the KS 16S. <br><br><h2>  KingSong KS16S 840WH </h2><br>  840 Wh, 1200 W, 17.3 kg, 66,900‚ÇΩ <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a20/b92/91d/a20b9291dbbfb6a26459d2d5021426cb.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  If you need something heavy to move far and for a long time - you are here.  Once he consulted a colleague on the development of skating skills and, accordingly, had a chance to try.  There is a minus - a lot of pressure on the lower leg, since the battery pack strongly protrudes from the body at a low height.  However, this minus is only for the period of study. <br><br><h2>  Inmotion V10F </h2><br>  960 Wh, 2000 W, 20.6 kg, 82,000‚ÇΩ <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/825/e73/f04/825e73f04380750bf5a2e669e8efc587.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Even more long-range option.  Sense for trips to work in the last two models can not see.  For long pokatushek - the very thing, of course. <br><br><h2>  Inmotion V8 or KingSong KS14D </h2><br>  I use both models and can make detailed lists of mutual benefits.  With them it is useful to get acquainted also with the aim to understand what other parameters are important for the choice of the wheel. <br><br>  <b>Over 14D</b> <br><br>  + cheaper <br>  + more nimble (result size 14 ") <br>  + smaller size (consequence of size 14 ") <br>  + retractable handle is easy to push, significantly more convenient `push and roll <br>  - But for my height (185 cm) is a bit short, I have to bend <br>  + headlamp with light sensor <br>  + direction of travel does not matter - the white headlight turns on in the right direction <br>  + for me - significantly more comfortable pedals (wider) <br>  + you can listen to music through the speakers <br><br>  <b>Over V8</b> <br><br>  + more stable rides in a straight line (a consequence of the size of 16 ") <br>  + Better visits to the curb (a consequence of the size of 16 ") <br>  + less pressure on the lower leg, it is much easier to learn from it <br>  + Reliable separate carrying handle integrated into the body, with a button for temporary shutdown of the wheel, significantly more convenient to `take and carry` <br>  + retractable handle taller, with my height (185 cm) handle at 14D is a bit short <br>  + retractable handle is more reliable;  I note that in general kingsonga retractable handle - a very weak point <br>  + longer range <br>  + there is a company cover <br>  + "Denser" all done, monolith <br>  + Pedals more conveniently fold (foot once and ready, with 14D not so) <br><br>  My personal choice of these two models is definitely V8, with the following comments: <br><br>  - the retractable handle ‚Äúflips out‚Äù very tightly, as a workaround I do not click until the end <br>  - the gaps between the wheel and the body are very small, may require "lifting".  I did it <br>  easy, <a href="https://electrotransport.ru/ussr/index.php%3Fmsg%3D1087308">one</a> and <a href="https://electrotransport.ru/ussr/index.php%3Fmsg%3D1112290">two</a> . <br>  - if you drive hard, you can <a href="https://electrotransport.ru/ussr/index.php%3Fmsg%3D1206379">catch the pendulum</a> (I have never had one) <br>  - it is uncomfortable to drive in light shoes, the upper part of the wheel is too tight to the legs, in a few minutes there are unpleasant sensations.  I wear tourist or winter boots and everything is ok - they increase the gap between the legs and the wheel <br><br>  Something like this. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/454070/">https://habr.com/ru/post/454070/</a></p>
