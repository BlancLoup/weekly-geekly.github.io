Phase II research sponsored by Atara Biotherapeutics is planned in several locations in Australia and the USA. <br><br>  More than 25,000 Australians are estimated to have multiple sclerosis, with symptoms including coordination problems, impaired stability, weak limbs, cognitive problems and memory loss. <br><br>  Most patients with MS are diagnosed with a recurrent form of remission, but some of them develop a secondary progressive form in which the symptoms gradually worsen. <br><br>  From the outset, a small portion is diagnosed with primary progressive form. <br><br>  There are a number of treatments aimed at preventing attacks in MS remission, but there are limited treatment options for patients with advanced forms of MS. <br><br>  Professor Khanna said that immunotherapy involves taking blood from patients, extracting T (immune) cells and ‚Äúprogramming‚Äù them in the laboratory to recognize and destroy EBV in patients with MS. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/431692/">https://habr.com/ru/post/431692/</a></p>
