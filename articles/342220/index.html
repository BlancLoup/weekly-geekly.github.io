    <ul><li>  We managed to cover <b>21</b> largest cities of Russia.  Among them are Moscow, St. Petersburg, Yekaterinburg and Kazan. </li><li>  It turned out to increase the total number of metro stations from <b>65</b> to <b>346</b> . </li><li>  The average number of ads increased from <b>131.2</b> to <b>519.41</b> per day. </li><li>  A settings control panel has been added. </li><li>  Bots for <b>Telegram</b> and <b>Vkontakte</b> have been added.  They automatically notify subscribers of new announcements. </li></ul><br>  Hereinafter, I will use the word <b>service</b> - as an <b>SOA</b> module, and not the entire web service. <br><br>  I chose the <b>SOA</b> architecture because it enabled: <br><br><ul><li>  Use different technologies to solve different problems. </li><li>  Develop service independently of others. </li><li>  Deploy services independently. </li><li>  Scale services horizontally. </li></ul><br>  You could call it microservice architecture, but there were some minor differences.  Between services, data exchange is used based on the ‚ÄúCommon Database‚Äù using the <b>MDBWP</b> protocol instead of the <b>HTTP API API</b> that is usual for microservices and storing the data of each service in its database.  This approach was due to the rapid development with the ability to retain all the advantages of the described <b>SOA</b> approach. <br><br>  <b>Ansible</b> was chosen to automate the warmup. <br>  This is one of the configuration management systems that has a low entry threshold. <br><br>  <b>MongoDB</b> was chosen as the database.  This document-oriented database was perfect for storing ads with a list of metro stations, contact details of landlords, and a description of the ad. <br><br>  At the moment, the general scheme of interaction between services is as follows: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jp/vd/0y/jpvd0yglgvbejbum9nawypycpfu.png"><br><br><h3>  Services: </h3><br><hr><br><h4>  rent-view - service display ads and search for them </h4><br>  <a href="https://github.com/mrsuh/rent-view">github.com/mrsuh/rent-view</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/km/w7/5s/kmw75s8eupfqk5qdokfmazv0i8e.png"><br><br>  The service is written on <b>NodeJS</b> , because  The most important criterion of its quality was the speed of the server‚Äôs response to the user. <br><br>  The service requests ads in <b>MongoDB</b> , renders HTML pages using the <b>doT.js</b> template <b>engine</b> and gives them to the browser. <br><br>  The service is built using <b>Grunt</b> . <br><br>  To work in a browser, scripts are written in pure <b>JS</b> , and styles are written in <b>LESS</b> .  <b>Nginx is</b> used as a proxy server, which caches part of the responses and provides an <b>HTTPS</b> connection. <br><br><h4>  rent-collector - ad collection service </h4><br>  <a href="https://github.com/mrsuh/rent-collector">github.com/mrsuh/rent-collector</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/eu/gd/w5/eugdw52yaksvmqdhgewta1exrxk.png"><br><br>  The service collects ads, classifies them and writes them to the database. <br><br>  It is written in <b>PHP</b> for several reasons: knowledge of the necessary libraries for writing the service, as well as high speed of development. <br><br>  The <b>symfony 3</b> framework is used. <br><br>  <b>Beanstalk</b> was selected as the queuing service.  It is lightweight, but does not have its own message broker.  This is exactly what is needed for a small virtual server and for non-critical data to be lost. <br><br>  Using <b>beanstalk</b> , <b>4</b> messaging <b>channels</b> were made: <br><br><ul><li>  <b>parser</b> - highlights from the text such facts as ad type, price, description and links.  To speed up the processing of data, I launched several consumers for this channel. <br>  Note: the consumer communicates with the rent-parser service. </li><li>  <b>collector</b> - writes the processed data about the ads in the database. </li><li>  <b>notifier</b> - notifies users of new ads.  Note: the user communicates with the rent-notifier service. </li><li>  <b>publisher</b> - publishes ads in several Vkontakte groups. </li></ul><br><h4>  rent-parser - classified ads service </h4><br>  <a href="https://github.com/mrsuh/rent-parser">github.com/mrsuh/rent-parser</a> <br>  Service written in <b>Golang</b> . <br><br>  To extract structured data from the text, the service uses the <b>Tomita</b> parser from <b>Yandex</b> .  Performs preprocessing of the text and subsequent processing of the results of parsing. <br><br>  So that you can test the service, I made <b>an open API</b> . <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Try parser online</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Request: <br><pre><code class="bash hljs">curl -X POST -d <span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">'   30   .  + 7 999 999 9999'</span></span> <span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">'http://api.socrent.ru/parse'</span></span></code> </pre> <br>  Answer: <br><br><pre> <code class="bash hljs">{<span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">"type"</span></span>:2,<span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">"phone"</span></span>:[<span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">"9999999999"</span></span>],<span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">"price"</span></span>:30000}</code> </pre> <br>  Types of ads: <br>  + 0 - room <br>  + 1 - 1 bedroom apartment <br>  + 2 - 2 bedroom apartment <br>  + 3 - 3 bedroom apartment <br>  + 4 - 4+ room apartment <br>  + 5 - studio <br>  + 6 - no ads <br></div></div><br>  For more information about the classification of ads, I wrote here <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/328282">habrahabr.ru/post/328282</a> <br><br><h4>  rent-control - settings management service </h4><br>  <a href="https://github.com/mrsuh/rent-control">github.com/mrsuh/rent-control</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/8k/s1/rr/8ks1rr5fls9ylrgdfjtknenqima.png"><br><br>  It is written in <b>PHP</b> for several reasons: knowledge of the necessary libraries for writing the service, as well as high speed of development. <br>  The <b>symfony 3</b> framework is used. <br>  <b>Bootstrap</b> Style Library <b>3</b> . <br><br>  The settings managed by the service include: <br><br><ul><li>  ads; </li><li>  black list; </li><li>  publication configurations; </li><li>  configuration parsing. </li></ul><br>  Initially, all the data to control the parsing lay in the configuration files.  With the increase in the number of cities, it was necessary to visualize them and simplify the editing of records.  In addition, it was required to simplify the addition of new parameters. <br><br><h4>  rent-notifier is a bot service for sending out new announcements in Telegram and Vkontakte. </h4><br>  <a href="https://github.com/mrsuh/rent-notifier">github.com/mrsuh/rent-notifier</a> <br><br>  Example of subscribing to ads: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vv/gy/d-/vvgyd-nlbehw0v_p6np04qhu38a.png"><br><br>  The service is written in <b>Golang</b> due to the criticality of the speed of response to the user. <br>  The essence of the service is as follows: you subscribe to the distribution of new announcements, and as you add, the bot sends you messages about them.  The service inserts a link to the original ad in the message text. <br><br><h3>  Auxiliary repos </h3><br><hr><br><h4>  Code for PHP common database </h4><br>  <a href="https://github.com/mrsuh/rent-schema">github.com/mrsuh/rent-schema</a> <br><br>  General database schema: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ie/xu/6b/iexu6bxegp5qx0kyd6-ll6pohc4.png"><br><br>  With the addition of the rent-control service, the duplication of the database schema code appeared.  Therefore, it was decided to make the code in a separate package.  Now for any service in <b>PHP, it is</b> enough to add this package to the dependencies via <b>composer</b> . <br><br><pre> <code class="bash hljs">composer require mrsuh/rent-schema</code> </pre> <br><br><h4>  ODM for mongoDB </h4><br>  <a href="https://github.com/mrsuh/mongo-odm">github.com/mrsuh/mongo-odm</a> <br><br>  The first ODM for PHP MongoDB that I thought was <b>Doctrine 2</b> .  It comes with <b>symfony 3</b> and has good documentation. <br><br>  But at the time of writing the service, in order for this <b>ODM to</b> start working with the latest version of drivers for <b>Mongo PHP</b> , it was necessary to install another package as a layer between the new and the old <b>API</b> .  <b>Doctrine 2</b> is a fairly large project in itself, and with an additional package it became even bigger.  Instead, I wanted something lightweight.  Therefore, I decided to write <b>ODM</b> myself with a minimal functional set.  And I did it - <b>ODM</b> completely copes with its responsibilities. <br><br><h3>  Some statistics </h3><br><hr><br>  The service adds an average of <b>519.41</b> ads per day to the site. <br><br>  The most popular metro stations, among the largest cities of Russia, were the following: <br><br><ul><li>  <b>St. Petersburg</b> - Devyatkino </li><li>  <b>Moscow</b> - Komsomolskaya </li><li>  <b>Kazan</b> - Victory Avenue </li><li>  <b>Ekaterinburg</b> - Uralmash </li><li>  <b>Nizhny Novgorod</b> - Avtozavodskaya </li><li>  <b>Novosibirsk</b> - Marx Square </li><li>  <b>Samara</b> - Moscow </li></ul><br>  More statistics can be viewed on the site itself. <br><br><h3>  Conclusion </h3><br><hr><br>  If you have not yet decided whether you need an <b>SOA</b> architecture, then make a monolithic application with a breakdown into modules.  So it will be easier to transfer your application to services if necessary.  But if you still decide to use <b>SOA</b> architecture, you should understand that this may increase the complexity of the development, the complexity of the deployment, the amount of code, as well as the volume of messages between services. <br><br>  PS I found the last two apartments with the help of my service.  I hope he helps you too. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/342220/">https://habr.com/ru/post/342220/</a></p>
