      What happens when an object falls into a black hole?  Does he disappear without a trace?  About thirty years ago, one of the leading researchers of the phenomenon of black holes, now the famous British physicist Stephen Hawking, said that this is exactly what is happening.  But it turns out that such a response threatens everything we know about physics and the fundamental laws of the universe.  The author of this book, the eminent American physicist Leonard Susskind, for many years argued with Stephen Hawking about the nature of black holes, until finally, in 2004, he admitted his mistake.  A brilliant and extremely easy-to-read book tells the fascinating story of this long-standing scientific confrontation, which radically changed the way physicists look at the nature of reality.  The new paradigm has led to the stunning conclusion that everything in our world is this book, your house, you yourself are just a kind of hologram projected from the edges of the Universe.  The book is included in the library of the fund "Dynasty". <br><br>  <i><a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/piter/blog/169271/">Announcement of the book on Habr√©</a></i> <i><br></i>  <i><a href="http://www.piter.com/book.phtml%3F978549600395">Book on piter.com</a></i> <i><br></i>  <i><a href="http://www.piter.com/upload/contents/978549600395/978549600395_X.pdf">Table of contents</a></i> <i><br></i>  <i><a href="http://www.piter.com/upload/contents/978549600395/978549600395_p.pdf">Excerpt</a></i> <br><br>  <b>Defragmentation of the brain.</b>  <b>Soft building from the inside</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a19/ba9/fc4/a19ba9fc4f9ad0c6df2c104984f9e44d.jpg"><br><br>  This book is for those who have long been involved in software development.  Or for those who still think to choose programming their profession.  Or for those who are just used to thinking and thinking about what is happening in the world of information technology.  It is no secret that the bulk of soft-engineering is concentrated in the sector of so-called corporate development: from integrated information systems of an enterprise to individual applications.  Therefore, a large part of the plots is specifically Enterprise Programming.  From the text, you are unlikely to learn how to glue multi-storey buildings from ready-made components in a heterogeneous environment, design interfaces, synchronize processes, or write effective queries to databases.  Such topics will only be the background for a story about soft-construction "kitchen".  With a certain amount of curiosity, you can make sure that the new is well forgotten old, find out how some complex systems are organized, when different technologies should be applied, why computer scientists need to be especially careful in filtering information coming from many sources, and much more may not yet have known or already know, but on the other hand.  In the book, I wanted to show our software development world of developing corporate information systems not from the main facade of descriptions of software environments, approaches and technologies, but from the inside.  How it happened - to judge the reader. <br><br>  <i><a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/piter/blog/177829/">Announcement of the book on Habr√©</a></i> <i><br></i>  <i><a href="http://www.piter.com/book.phtml%3F978549600606">Book on piter.com</a></i> <i><br></i>  <i><a href="http://www.piter.com/upload/contents/978549600606/978549600606_X.pdf">Table of contents</a></i> <i><br></i>  <i><a href="http://www.piter.com/upload/contents/978549600606/978549600606_p.pdf">Excerpt</a></i> <br><br>  <b>Object-oriented analysis and design</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/cbe/b5d/b23/cbeb5db23f131568993c1b3bfcd61419.jpg"><br><br>  Tired of reading books on object-oriented analysis and design, which are understandable only to specialists?  You may have heard that OOAP helps to write good programs - programs that will be enough for your superiors and customers.  But how to do that?  The book will show you how the analysis, design and writing of serious object-oriented programs are organized;  programs that are easy to reuse, maintain, and extend;  programs that do not have a headache;  programs in which you can add new features without disrupting the old.  You will learn about the place of OO principles, design patterns and various development methods in the OOAP project life cycle.  Through the use of features of the brain, this book reduces the time of assimilation and memorization of complex information.
