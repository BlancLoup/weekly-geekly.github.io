The first concrete step - <b>we completely reworked the system of content services for short numbers</b> .

      Subscribers (including beta testers from Habr) named the main things that need to be changed: <br><ul><li>  Terms of services should be clear and well visible. </li><li>  Once a connected service should not be forgotten, if not needed by the subscriber. </li><li>  Disconnection should be done simply and quickly. </li><li>  Pensioners and children should be protected from random subscription to a paid service. </li></ul><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  4 basic principles </h4><br>  - <b>Responsibility.</b>  We take control over the procedure for activating the services of content providers.  If the subscriber is not satisfied with the quality of the content or the terms of tariffing are not clear to him, the operator will deal with both the solution of his question and the implementation of preventive measures. <br><br>  - <b>Informing.</b>  We inform subscribers at all stages of using the content provider service: <br><ol><li>  SMS before service activation. </li><li>  Mandatory confirmation of service activation. </li><li>  SMS after ordering the service with an indication of the cost and method of disconnection. </li><li>  Monthly informing about what services of content providers are connected on the number and how to disable them. </li><li>  Disable any and every subscription after 90 days.  If you need to renew - once again the procedure starting from point 2. </li></ol><br>  At the same time we have gone through the entire database of content providers.  At the time of publication, already 90% of the content providers' services of Beeline subscribers can only receive with an additional AoC (Advice of charge) from Beeline - confirmation of the service order.  In particular, this applies to all services provided through the "subscription", as well as services worth more than 100 rubles. <br><br>  - <b>Return of funds.</b>  If any violations in the provision of the service by the content provider are detected, Beeline returns all debited funds to customers.  In addition, Beeline charges funds from non-monetary balance from fines levied from the content provider.  Beeline does not earn fines - all sums are credited to customers as moral compensation. <br><br>  Among other things, this means that if there is some kind of violation by the content provider that we don‚Äôt know about, subscribers will receive a financial incentive to report it as soon as possible. <br><br>  - <b>Relevance.</b>  Beeline establishes a validity period of 90 days for subscriptions to content providers.  After 90 days the subscription is automatically disconnected.  And to extend it, you need to confirm your decision with an additional action. <br><br><h4>  Children's tariff plans </h4><br>  All out-of-the-box children's tariff plans come with an activated ban on content provider services.  Also, the ‚ÄúVeteran‚Äù and ‚ÄúMobile Pensioner‚Äù tariff plans have a pre-activated ban. <br><br><h4>  No subscription without your consent </h4><br>  <b>All this has already been done.</b> <br><br>  By February, we began to receive 6.5 times fewer tickets for content providers to call centers in comparison with February 2012 (it should be noted that the market itself was developing, that is, the direct effect is above 6.5 times ). <br><br><h4>  Further changes </h4><br><ul><li>  We are already using crowdsourced mechanics to search for technical problems in the network and identify places with weak signal.  Development of the network and improvement of the quality of communication is one of the main priorities.  About implementation a little later. </li><li>  The second step is to optimize the tariff line and simplify the package of services in terms of achieving the optimal price-quality ratio and in the logic of ‚Äúone need - one service‚Äù </li><li>  We will continue to increase the transparency of the provision of services: we need full clarity of notifications, understanding by the subscriber of each action. </li><li>  Providing the most prompt and convenient customer service through all channels: Customer support centers, sales offices, online resources. </li></ul><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúOn condition of consistent and precise implementation of this strategy, Beeline will be able to prove by its example that a customer-oriented business in Russia can be cost-effective.‚Äù <br>  <i>General Director of VimpelCom, Mikhail Slobodin.</i> </blockquote>  <b>Well, honestly, did not wait?</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/213683/">https://habr.com/ru/post/213683/</a></p>
