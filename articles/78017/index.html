  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Tale of why I got up and left</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  There is a lot of talk about teachers at school, about teachers at the institute.  I'll try to insert my 5 kopecks, since the topic is interesting.  Only I was associated with a private school, where classes are held in the form of tutoring, and not lectures to a large audience. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  How I came to this </h4><br>  Once I was just offered to go to a friend and ask what she has to offer.  I then studied in the second year of my first institute and was not averse to earning some money for <s>these your Internet</s> stationery. <br><br>  When I came to the class for the first time, there was nothing for me there.  There were several boxes remotely resembling computers.  They rustled at that time still Windows 98. On the windows there were two pots of flowers.  Everything brought on the workflow :) And if I wanted to get something, I had to create a work for myself.  Literally.  Well, as buns to monitor the normal operation of cool computers, and later engage in software licensing. <br><br>  I spent about two weeks to create my own course "Repair and Upgrade PC."  At that time I had no idea who would need it and why, so I had to shovel tons of books.  They all share one thing: the lack of structure.  I won‚Äôt say for sure what the tutorial manuals contain now, but at that time it was tight: the authors jumped from one to another, some chapters contained only letters, and in the third there was a set of nowhere specific terms.  It was necessary for everything else to bring in the course delicious, like small tales about architecture, just do mathematics and mathematics for transferring numbers from one number system suddenly in particular.

      I had long hair, glasses, and I thought I could. <br><br><h4>  And what actually </h4><br>  My courses had a certain popularity.  People came and knew exactly why: they needed Windows.  Contracts were drawn up, advances were paid and the action began. <br><br>  Oddly enough, but in my course, installing / fixing Windows was the very last line.  Exactly after the diagnosis of iron and cleaning dust from the monitor.  I talked about disk layout, talked about the importance of nutrition.  But it was boring and people slept naturally.  We had to wake up and send home :) Although there were adequate students, for example, one ‚ÄúChernobyl‚Äù, who was interested only in a piece of hardware in terms of connecting to a computer linkages.  He led some kind of radio electronics circle at the school and he had to travel an hour by train to listen to tales about the ports. <br><br>  To me, kind grandmothers recorded their granddaughters (!).  Well, how can you tell the boy 14-year-old courses that bearded guys do not all catch?  It was necessary to settle such questions, if only there was no war. <br><br><h4>  So what's wrong </h4><br>  I got a little.  On average, even less teachers in school.  But I did not have to mess with magazines, there were no ratings, statements and other Labuda.  I received cash in cash, exactly half the price of the course.  The course was incomplete a month for 2 hours a day on weekdays, which means for me it was not very stressful and allowed me to work two jobs and have time to read courses in the evening.  The head was not jealous;) In order not to lie, I worked in parallel for half a year in one local school as an ‚Äúengineer‚Äù.  I messed around with glands, banished viruses.  But I did not get accustomed there: it was impossible to work for two chiefs with opposing opinions. <br><br>  But as time went on, after 5 months without a month, the degree of inadequacy began to rise.  Pupils were cunning: they began to demand <i>to change course</i> on the move, to ask to come to tell <i>at home</i> or tried <i>not to pay</i> for courses.  Of course, none of these points suited me.  For example, in the classroom for me there was a certain security <s>, but outside the class I could easily have my head torn off or cut with rusty sharpening</s> .  To ask people to stop fooling around and finally try to listen, all of a sudden there would be some true thought among my nonsense, it was useless.  If money is paid up, a service must be rendered.  Only nowhere was it stipulated how it should be rendered.  And, in fact, the paid hours were spent on all sorts of left chatter, not related to the course.  All this is tired.  Strong.  It was also difficult to ask people after the promise to ‚Äúcome‚Äù to attend classes.  Pupils <i>forgot</i> about classes, and just sitting there is just too tiring to wait. <br><br><h4>  Eventually </h4><br>  As a result, on my own initiative, I terminated the last two contracts.  To suffer bullying even for money was unbearable.  I had to return the advance money, get up and leave. <br><br>  I do not think it was my failure, but a rewarding experience.  I could continue to fight with windmills, trying to improve the quality of my work, arouse the interest of students, show special computer magic.  But laziness and low self-esteem did their job. <br><br><h4>  findings </h4><br>  On Habr√© they write a lot about the relevance of knowledge in educational institutions, for example, instead of Pascal telling children about C #.  But no one who came to my classes asked me to talk about anything relevant.  When Windows XP was fresh, they asked to show the installation of Windows 98. When Vista came out, they asked to show Windows XP.  And the last year added to the Linux course was ignored, well, at least they didn‚Äôt refuse to look at Ubuntu and that was good.  This means that the opinion that self-education is the essence of good, is almost close to reality. <br><br>  I am very grateful to the boss that gave me a springboard for such experiments.  I hope Mother Earth does not end on me, and there will be another man who can repeat my feat. <br>  Let it be so. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/78017/">https://habr.com/ru/post/78017/</a></p>
