      <b>1. Tips and ideas for the holiday</b> (what to wear, what to cook, where to celebrate).  Such content is extremely useful and interesting on the eve of the holiday, because subscribers seek not only to choose a gift for their beloved, but also to surprise the venue of the holiday, their outfit, delicious dinner, etc. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/68f/3eb/220/68f3eb220b414a299d1881da6a111294.jpg"><br><br>  Most often, companies provide tips or ideas for the holiday based on the products of their brand.  For example, ‚ÄúZ gallerie‚Äù offers to organize a wonderful breakfast in bed with the help of their luxurious bed linen and stylish trays for food. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/465/752/8ea/4657528ea3c548489093d7ee34ec8b3a.jpg"><br><br>  <b>2. Gift Guides.</b>  Almost 85% of subscribers ask the question ‚ÄúWhat to donate?‚Äù And it is the guides to the gifts that answer it.  You only need to know which brand products you want to purchase. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/049/582/c1f/049582c1f79045d7abe53fb442410b5d.jpg"><br><br>  <b>3. Discounts and promotions.</b>  Discounts and promotions - a classic of the genre.  Each of these methods is proven over the years, and on the eve of the holidays they are especially effective.  If you have already chosen this type of content, then make discounts on all products, and not just on the one that can be presented on Valentine's Day. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d3d/01a/430/d3d01a4302f54539a277daa853234439.jpg"><br><br>  <b>4. Special collections for the Day of all lovers.</b>  Many companies prepare special products for a particular holiday.  Such products are distinguished by their symbolism (for example, heart, cupid), color, which corresponds to the holiday, etc. <br>  Chocolate brand ‚ÄúGodiva‚Äù made heart-shaped candies specially for Valentine's Day, as well as other sweets that can be seen by clicking on the link. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bab/5e9/4c0/bab5e94c00f244458778ee090248b9a2.jpg"><br><br>  <b>5. Warm greetings.</b>  Do not miss the simple warm congratulations without trying to sell something.  Such a letter may be the final in a series. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c1f/706/575/c1f7065759854a17be66a0f3c318bbdf.jpg"><br><br>  <b><u>Newsletter Design Tips:</u></b> <br><br><ul><li>  Use the traditional symbolism that is associated with Valentine's Day: hearts, cupids, sweets and flowers.  You can also use stylized images. </li><li>  It is necessary to give preference to such colors as pink, red, white.  But do not make the colors too bright, ‚Äúpoisonous‚Äù, as they can cause a negative reaction in the subscriber with the desire to close the letter.  It would be best to use these colors in a pastel, delicate, not ‚Äúeye-cutting‚Äù shade. </li><li>  Always think about how your letter will look on tablets and mobile devices.  Since according to statistics from the Google Analytics department, <a href="http://blog.easybusinesss.ru/e-mail-marketing-business/adaptivnye-pisma-v-e-mail-rassylkax.html">82% of users</a> check mail using mobile phones.  Adaptability - the key to success! </li><li>  Add a gif or video to make your email more attractive and interesting. </li><li>  Do not use too many pictures.  1-2 will be enough. </li><li>  Use standard fonts. </li></ul><br><br>  <b><u>Time to send</u></b> <br><br>  Before you start a newsletter, you need to clearly understand who it will be focused on.  According to the data from the online gift shop <a href="http://podarki.ru/chto-podarit/kto-darit-podarki-casche-muzhchini-ili-zhenschini">‚ÄúPresents.ru‚Äù</a> , women more often buy gifts for their halves and spend more time searching for them: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/06d/36e/f12/06d36ef1272341edb5caec9633fa1408.png"><br><br>  Therefore, make the design of newsletters more feminine, expand the choice of gifts for men and use more images than text. <br><br>  <b>When to send?</b> <br><br>  Americans are starting to do the newsletter 20 days before the holiday, and the Russians, in turn, for two weeks.  But the company <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/marketingcloud/">Retail Email</a> conducted its research in order to calculate exactly when most of the mailings go.  The results showed that 2 of 3 mailings are sent on February 6, 8 and 12. <br>  After you have learned when your competitors send emails, it is worth thinking about what time customers most often make purchases.  And here will help you another study conducted by the company ¬´Experian¬ª.  They found out that the greatest number of purchases is made <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/bingads/why-retailers-heart-valentines-day-search">a week</a> before the holiday of all lovers: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/79e/4b2/9a3/79e4b29a37964c4e9cef681320f54a46.png"><br><br>  Based on all the information received, we will make a <b>schedule of distribution to the Day of lovers:</b> <br><br>  <b>January 15-25</b> - remind your subscribers that Valentine's Day is coming, provide some gift ideas and add a survey about how your customers are going to celebrate this holiday.  Do not forget that subsequent letters should logically complement the first. <br><br>  <b>January 25-30</b> - based on the first email, send the following with options for gifts and ways to present them. <br><br>  <b>February 4-6</b> - motivate subscribers to make purchases, offer various promotions, discounts, bonuses, etc.  For example, when buying any product, holiday packaging as a gift. <br><br>  <b>February 11-12</b> - remind about the purchase of gifts to those users who within at least 3 months opened at least one letter. <br><br>  <b>February 13</b> - you should not already try to sell something.  It is better to send advice on how exactly you can spend the day of all lovers with your half or how to surprise him / her. <br><br>  <b>February 14</b> - send a declaration of love to your subscribers and advise an interesting melodrama to those who are alone on this day. <br><br>  <b>February 15-17</b> - ask subscribers how they spent a romantic evening with their halves and what they gave. <br><br>  Make the mailing original, surprise customers with promotions, discounts and send your holiday email on time.  I wish you success! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/297986/">https://habr.com/ru/post/297986/</a></p>
