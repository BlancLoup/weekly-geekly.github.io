This is both more interesting and more efficient, and noticeably cheaper than buying a sistemnik with a patterned iron in a store. <br><br>  However, those who do not build computers on a regular basis feel the need to re-read the news of the IT market over the past few months in order to collect the best configuration, balanced in three main parameters: <br>  1. Performance (not all megahertz are equally useful) <br>  2. Compatibility (ATI and NVidia are not friendly in SLI mode) <br>  3. Efficiency (not all of us have our own oil rig)

      The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa startup is to create a site on which the best (according to the advice of experienced hardcorers) configuration of a computer <i>at the moment</i> , in 3 price categories: for ~ 15, for ~ 30 and ~ 45 tr.  (roughly: for $ 500, $ 1000, and $ 1,500. I chose these ranges as the most popular among people who assemble their own systems).  Further, depending on the specific needs, the picky users themselves can replace something in a universal configuration with their own (for example, put a second hard drive or a top-end sound machine). <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Benefit to all people: the</b> target audience of the project - people who want to assemble a computer with their own hands, and spend a minimum of time on it.  And for them, the honest opinion of an experienced specialist is at times more objective than the advice of a consultant in a store, the goal of which, at best, is to sell the most suitable hardware from the stock available and not from the stock on the market.  And in the worst case - ... well, you yourself know that. <br><br>  <b>Benefit creators: the</b> site can be monetized by advertising stores selling these same components for computers. <br><br>  The development of the resource and its long creative life will be ensured by the fact that the IT industry is also constantly evolving, prices jump up and down, and as long as users are not forbidden to climb "under the hood", such analytics will enjoy stable demand.  In the future, resource creators may add sections with something else, for example, to sample the market in determining the ‚Äúfavorite of the month‚Äù on the niche of laptops or monitors.  Depending on the country or region, the ‚Äúbest‚Äù configuration may also differ, therefore, for $ 1,000 in St. Petersburg and Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk, it will be possible to assemble different computers.  You can also involve the users themselves in creating the most successful configuration, and in large regional centers there may be experts who know the local market. <br><br>  So it goes. <br><br>  At the same time, I would like to give advice and a request to those who want to create such a resource: the value of such a project is again in three main factors: <br>  - competence (you need to take a responsible approach to giving recommendations) <br>  - periodicity (stability and reliability of a resource is why it is valued) <br>  - honesty (to keep the reputation, and not to be carried on too tempting offers of advertising partners). <br><br>  Good luck to those who want to implement this. <br><br>  <b>UPD.</b> <br>  In the comments to this topic there are links to various resources that create periodically similar changes of configurations. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/111957/">https://habr.com/ru/post/111957/</a></p>
