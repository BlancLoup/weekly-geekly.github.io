With it, most companies increase their budget.  It is necessary to study the current trends of email newsletters, as the level of competition and the importance of email marketing for mobile devices is growing. <br>  Despite the fact that email competes with organic and paid search in e-commerce, it provides higher sales than social networks or display advertising. <br><br>  I have collected <b>7 main trends of email marketing for this year</b> , although, of course, it is not worth being limited to these recommendations alone. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Simple design to work on all devices</b>

      In 2014, we saw a transition to responsive email design: simplifying the interface with a focus on context, visual components and, to a lesser extent, text.  We can expect this to continue in 2015-2016. <br><br>  Companies should discuss techniques that are effective for both mobile and desktop devices, as more and more recipients read their emails on smartphones and tablets.  But the CTR remains higher for emails read from the computer, which also cannot be ignored. <br><br>  In 2015, the most intelligent marketers convinced their copywriters and designers to focus on such things as content hierarchy and criteria for the perception of letters by the user. <br>  The illustration shows an example from John Lewis: the second version of the page demonstrates the appearance of increasingly simple messages, getting rid of elements of complex design and detailed advertising texts. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/db1/395/334/db13953344ee8be20a319bd7a30dec24.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>More animation</b> <br><br>  Advanced retail email marketers believe that animated gifs are effective, as people often save them to your hard drive.  Moving images more actively capture the attention of the reader, so using gifs is much easier to create a fascinating living letter. <br><br>  Dell has a successful story, which raised its profit by 109%, simply by adding a gif to its letter. <br><br>  Also, a fashion trend is the use of the cinemagraph effect when only part of the image is animated.  This effect is realized in the email of the company Mr.  Porter: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/c56/444/bdb/c56444bdbc09d01900065808a124cbda.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Video</b> <br><br>  Now, using HTML5 to embed videos in your letters is even easier than clicking on them for playback.  But the use of video is not allowed at all email clients.  You can work around this problem by replacing the video with animated gif-images. <br><br>  <b>Pop-up windows for increasing the subscriber base</b> <br><br>  This trend will be strengthened even more, as many companies mark the growth of their email subscriber base when using pop-up windows.  But you need to work with such elements carefully, since the pop-up calls to action can be intrusive and annoying subscribers, forcing them to leave the site forever and refuse to send. <br><br>  <b>Real Time Marketing</b> <br><br>  For many years, such marketing was used for online PR and was known as 'Always-OnMarketing'.  Now more and more companies use it: relevant content, broadcast of actual images or information based on the real location of the user works many times better.  But this is only a return to the traditional idea - ‚Äúless creative emails, more relevant emails‚Äù. <br><br>  For example, the Hyatt hotel chain broadcasts the air temperature at a resort in a letter, suggesting subscribers to the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãsunny Hawaii. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/0dc/0cf/49d/0dc0cf49d9ba7ce6df6bb201d85a72f6.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Dynamic content adjustment</b> <br>  The reality of email marketing is such that masterful targeting gives the greatest response, despite the widespread fascination with designer chips.  This is not to say that it does not matter, but ... Email marketers mainly use data for several years for their campaigns.  They are based on the profile and user interactions, it is they who determine the content of emails. <br><br>  At the next level of dynamic tuning, we will see more personalized ad campaigns built on a wide range of data sources. <br><br>  <b>Predictive intelligence</b> <br>  Predictive intelligence uses already known patterns of user behavior.  Forecasting based on user preferences from different audience segments is increasingly used to select email offers and content. <br><br>  This affordable tool is increasingly being used as the basis of email campaigns, as it allows you to increase the number of responses from email recipients. <br><br>  Working with external data is always effective and this possibility, as a rule, is.  This is the method in its campaigns all advanced email-marketers. <br><br>  * Also, do not forget to use the Double opt-in subscription.  This eliminates spam from customers, and the company from a negative image, allowing you to work only with interested subscribers. <br><br>  Understanding email marketing mechanisms is necessary to successfully compete in the inbox, to attract and retain customers.  Therefore, it is so important to take time to understand its fundamental principles and, of course, follow the trends.  And modern mailing services, constantly expanding their functionality, allow us to make email campaigns really effective. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/294634/">https://habr.com/ru/post/294634/</a></p>
