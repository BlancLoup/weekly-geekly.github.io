The first "shovel" was the MX3 with a diagonal of 5.1-inches.  More - more, MX4 conquered 5.36 inches, and MX4 Pro debuted with a diagonal of 5.5 inches, and it seemed that the company no longer intends to produce compact smartphones, similar to the notable sales leader Meizu MX2 with a diagonal of 4.4 inches.  But relatively recently introduced a new line of smartphones pleased users.  The ideological models were the M1 Note devices and its younger brother M1 mini.  Unfortunately, on the territory outside of the Chinese networks, the smartphone simply turned out to be useless due to problems with the networks above GSM.  But today the picture is changing and already M1 mini is logically evolving into <a href="http://www.icover.ru/catalog/product/smartfon_meizu_m2_mini_m578h_16gb_lte_blue/">M2 mini</a> with improvements.  Now, against the background of the previous design, the tempting stuffing and the LTE module working in the Russian Federation have been added, as well as many other things that you will learn from the review, including a pleasant surprise at the end of the article for readers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/04f/791/df7/04f791df78f84f059e2b4ca1d336b427.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h2>  <font color="¬´#6aa400¬ª">Main characteristics</font> </h2><br>  ‚Ä¢ Body materials: plastic, glass (front panel - Asahi Glass); <br>  ‚Ä¢ Display: IPS, diagonal 5.0 ‚Äù-inch, resolution 1280 x 720 pixels, 296 ppi; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Processor: MediaTek MT6735 quad-core, up to 1.3 GHz; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Video chip: Mali-T720; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Operating system: Android 5.0.1, Flyme 4.5 *; <br>  ‚Ä¢ RAM: 2 GB; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Memory for data storage: 16 GB, microSD slot up to 128 GB; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Interfaces: Wi-Fi (ac / a / b / g / n), Bluetooth 4.0, GPS (A-GPS support), Glonass, microUSB 2.0 connector (MHL, USB-OTG), AUX; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Network: GSM / EDGE, UMTS / HSDPA, LTE (TD / FDD-LTE), (Dual SIM support); <br>  ‚Ä¢ Main camera: 13.0 MP.

    <h2>  <font color="¬´#6aa400¬ª">Package and Delivery</font> </h2><br>  Meizu M2 Mini comes in the usual packaging format of this manufacturer - its dimensions can be called average for the market.  The carton of which the box is made is silky and smooth according to tactile sensations, it looks expensive and pleasant.  Its density is significant, which will certainly have a positive effect on the transportation of the gadget. <br>  It is rather difficult to express an unequivocal opinion about the packaging design, since perception is always individual and depends on personal preferences.  In my opinion, the device deserves an approving response.  Focusing on the quality of packaging, the manufacturer rather hints about the low cost of the product. <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/196/13c/17b/19613c17ba154ab2bd7683746c75cad2.jpg"><br><br>  The information on the box is minimum - only the name of the model on top and a neatly decorated sticker on the bottom, which contains all the necessary legal and technical information. <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cf0/2eb/8fc/cf02eb8fcf374f33a75f4e78abec02cc.jpg"><br><br>  Under the cover is the Meizu M2 mini itself, as well as a clip for removing the SIM tray.  Under the smartphone is a notch with the documentation. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b05/185/5eb/b051855eb0684a749c5c4e2959b79aed.jpg"><br><br>  Under the substrate with a smartphone, you will see a modest package, which consists of a Micro USB cable and a charger.  Judging by the molding, there should have been headphones in it, but, alas, not in the case of official supplies for the Russian Federation and Europe.  Instead of headphones, only a plug is available.  However, if desired, the empty space can be supplemented with one of two branded headsets - EP-21HD or EP-20S.  From my point of view, the decision to abandon the complete headphones will not upset the potential buyer.  The price in this case plays an important role, and not everyone wants to overpay for a ‚Äúweak‚Äù, as usual, headset.  There are no complaints about the quality of the manufacture of accessories. <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4ba/863/04f/4ba86304ff9e47069c7e45b1569123f0.jpg"><br><br><br><br><h2>  <font color="¬´#6aa400¬ª">Appearance, design features and display</font> </h2><br>  I will begin the section with the fact that Meizu apparently did not have the task of producing a new and distinctive design of our model.  Meizu M2 Mini was made in the general style of older devices of the company, besides, it looks like a big fellow M2 Note or vice versa, who will like it more.  Similar tactics are now used by many companies.  But it cannot be said that for budget models this strategy is wrong, visually everything is presented adequately and this is important. <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b01/bbd/833/b01bbd8336b64690bbabab2aa5dd3c75.jpg"><br><br>  However, unlike the older models of the MX series, the M2 Mini has several bright body colors, namely pink and blue, to which the familiar white and gray are added.  The latter is just present in our test.  I recommend to look at this shade, the smartphone in it looks charismatic. <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/430/ab7/7b0/430ab77b0e00491499a3dd140cd66235.jpg"><br><br>  Despite the impressive five-inch display, the smartphone turned out to be very compact.  Dimensions of Meizu M2 mini are 68.9 x 140.1 x 8.7 mm, weight - 131 g. Indents on the sides of the display are about 3.5 mm.  Such indicators and the sloping edges of the case allow it to lie in the hand with great comfort. <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8a1/bd6/30c/8a1bd630c8f941c4beb6cb58b54665e5.jpg"><br><br>  Made Meizu M2 mini from plastic, namely from polycarbonate.  Internal frame for metal components.  Well, the front panel, respectively, completely covers the tempered glass with oleophobic coating (Asahi Glass).  In the hands of the smartphone in the flagship looks expensive.  I can‚Äôt call a brand for it, it is resistant to any flaws, like scratches, especially with good handling.  And even with the appearance of such in small quantities, they will not be evident due to the color and texture of the case.  Approximately similar situation with glass.  But since marcost is still present and it is not very easy to remove contamination from the display, a conclusion about the mediocre application of an oleophobic coating arises. <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9ff/4a0/350/9ff4a0350bfd432db7b61bfb77b5641e.jpg"><br><br>  Returning to the front panel, we will discuss the display in more detail.  As I said, the Meizu M2 mini is equipped with a high-quality five-inch IPS matrix - a resolution of 1280 x 720. The pixel density is 269 PPI.  Multitouch supports up to ten simultaneous touches.  The manufacturer claims a contrast ratio of 1000: 1 and a maximum brightness of 400 nits.  Like it or not, I check, unfortunately, failed.  But the overall impression of the display is quite satisfactory.  The picture is quite clear, like the color.  You cannot call a bright display, because at maximum brightness on the street, it is rather difficult to look through the phone, for example, articles on geektimes.ru, but in the darkness the eyes will not make a display exactly. <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/890/713/fab/890713faba3c4ab2a90cf9d0ed4c12ee.jpg"><br><br>  A closer look at the gadget, the first thing that attracts attention is the mechanical key in the center, exactly like the older models.  However, unlike the MX series brethren, it does not carry a fingerprint scanner.  Its functionality is quite wide.  When you press a key, you are transferred to the home screen, and when touched, the action is reversed.  When you press and hold the lock display.  The button is flat, slightly recessed into the body, made in the shape of a rectangle with rounded corners.  There is, on sensations, a metal edging.  There are no more keys on the central panel.  Running a little ahead, I will say that the multitasking menu opens with a swipe up from the bottom of the display. <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/05e/83a/6c0/05e83a6c0fba4584b4031eb42ab97c1c.jpg"><br><br>  In the center above the display is a small speaker.  Its location is convenient and there are no complaints about the work.  The volume of the speaker is quite large.  Next to it is a block with proximity sensor and lighting.  And even further away is the eye of the front camera.  The LED event indicator is hidden on top.  He hides under glass and in a non-working state does not manifest himself at all.  Flashing smoothly white - moonlight.  The LED is quite bright and can be seen from any angle during the glow.  There are no complaints about the sensors in my test device. <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bc4/dae/748/bc4dae748e124f6bbabcc9a5817ed644.jpg"><br><br>  On the lid, closer to the bottom there is a logo and a small inscription in English, which informs about the development of the model in China. <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/37a/023/c1d/37a023c1d41648d19a8aa733f1ea5f68.jpg"><br><br>  But at the top in the center a single flash and a rather large eye of the camera found their place, by the way, it does not bulge.  Rather, he lacks a small metal edging. <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/67b/8f9/946/67b8f994654a4dee8f31933660b0d2c9.jpg"><br><br>  Below the center is the Micro - USB connector, just to the right of the microphone, and on the left side is the speaker, which is hidden under the perforated strip.  Immediately settled and several recessed deep cogs, which holds the case.  On top of his place found AUX connector.  Additional microphone in the smartphone could not be found, after all the middle class.  On the right side of the "rocker" volume control and on / off key.  Buttons, like the plastic case.  Pressed with a characteristic pleasant to the ear click, do not play, are conveniently located. <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/eba/8f9/71f/eba8f971ffc24db682563dd05e9446b5.jpg"><br><br>  On the left, except for the implied SIM tray, there is nothing else.  The phone is ‚Äútwo-SIM‚Äù, but in the case of the second SIM card, you will have to make a choice, either a memory card and one SIM card, or only two SIM cards.  I note that in the case of my test copy, the tray somehow did not sit very tightly and play.  The rest of the assembly no complaints, all soundly.  No squeaks, no backlash, no pushing, fitting parts is very accurate. <br><br><h2>  <font color="¬´#6aa400¬ª">Hardware, performance and software platform</font> </h2><br>  Meizu again preferred MediaTek solutions when choosing a hardware platform.  The Meizu M2 mini is equipped with a MediaTek MT6735 quad-core processor that can operate at up to 1.3 GHz.  The Mali-T720 chip is responsible for the graphics.  RAM in the smartphone 2 GB, a constant 16 GB.  MicroSD memory cards up to 128 gigabytes are supported. <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1ca/6a6/d3b/1ca6a6d3bab844c5b01854ab202e9d14.png"><br><br>  Before you start talking about the work of a smartphone in life, I propose to evaluate the results of testing in some popular benchmarks.  Let me remind you that the manufacturer chose the HD resolution of the display, most likely it will have a positive impact on performance. <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9e4/315/b30/9e4315b301f24f8b87814cc104d4b003.jpg"><br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Test results, careful, original resolution</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fd6/3b3/dd2/fd63b3dd2d3248e48d325ac12c91f26b.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3ce/891/7ae/3ce8917ae754414f9b4ba4cfad53de22.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6fa/412/fe9/6fa412fe9b184fc9b99b90d1374da190.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/174/d3a/953/174d3a9533b34a81a491e426825e2fbd.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/72e/bae/43e/72ebae43eee342e39557bfacea63d6f5.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/357/6a1/37e/3576a137e56f43238a59f6b821af23e4.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/054/9d0/6e2/0549d06e2aeb4c61ae2bef59f8f54abd.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a58/c13/b28/a58c13b2884840e5bf87e4705b5cfd23.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/152/57f/d66/15257fd664614e87b8a0496792e6e985.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e13/f3e/a2a/e13f3ea2ae7c49349f366857b4a08f0d.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4f8/252/53f/4f825253f5f646ab8f59f0496565d56f.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/409/cc9/0cc/409cc90cc8684e929f9ece21e5917077.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9c4/38e/c51/9c438ec51ed64651a1986f65ff6e673d.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/157/73e/3d0/15773e3d095e4c559960f09f228408b1.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/651/8fc/17b/6518fc17b7454b19ac887d20f12d3514.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/93f/0d5/3fe/93f0d53fe3364536821d347c260dd3b4.jpg"><br><br></div></div><br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Stability testing (Classic test - up to 20 minutes, and the final result at 45 minutes)</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f6a/68a/a30/f6a68aa30743464aba636f788f4b64b9.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fef/7f2/a10/fef7f2a108804d609651f970fa0182ef.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2c4/fc4/10c/2c4fc410c61b4fbb9cbd785d8418ded6.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/468/b25/db8/468b25db8a194d9d892d4c82c89ec3dd.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c10/d62/130/c10d6213016b46a9a4f259c6e6b9df83.jpg"><br><br></div></div><br><br>  In general, the end result does not affect the "consciousness", but to call a smartphone weak or budgetary in the literal sense of the word simply will not work.  But these are just numbers, what do we get in real work with a smartphone?  Quick launch of applications, almost complete absence of lags in these and interface, moderate heating under heavy load.  RAM is enough to keep on hand running all the necessary software (objectively, applications up to 10 with an average consumption of "RAM").  As for the compatibility of games, as well as the display of textures, there are no serious problems.  With 3D games in general, everything is fine.  According to statistics, most of the tested games, like GTA: San Andreas or Asphalt 8, were launched on medium graphics settings.  The only thing in Real Racing 3 was the problems with loading textures, but I will not say that this problem occurred often and the game status turned into ‚Äúnot playable‚Äù.  Although even the graphics settings were clearly not the maximum and average.  There is no problem with the stability of the smartphone. <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ade/f2f/101/adef2f101b524150b255c78922cc15f0.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fe2/f50/3fa/fe2f503fad26495999726bd4dac55f58.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fe9/ded/433/fe9ded4331184e1ab8143ae10d814ffb.jpg"><br><br>  As the basis of the operating system, the choice fell on Android 5.1.  But from the native interface in the shell Flyme almost nothing is left.  In this case there is an update on the "air".  Based on the experience of the manufacturer with previous models, it makes sense over time to expect further system updates.  We have already talked more about the Flyme system in our review of the Meizu MX5 and its features.  In the case of the M2 Mini, everything is also approximately.  For familiarization with the interface, traditionally, I will provide a package of screenshots. <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/449/e8e/458/449e8e458cc347998d793e797a0cbc51.jpg"><br><br>  It is worth noting that the manufacturer did not litter the system with unnecessary applications, but only pre-installed the most necessary.  As for official deliveries, all Chinese services are cut out in them.  In other versions, they are not only present, but also complemented by the absence of the Russian language.  Partly, Meizu made a strange decision related to the Russian language, but from a certain point of view this is understandable ...  In order not to breed empty talk and not to enter into polemics afterwards, we simply state as a fact. <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d5f/f3d/378/d5ff3d3786f149228ea0f07b76d25e1b.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/129/fc9/be3/129fc9be37804f84b15de9481a76a8a6.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ece/17f/79d/ece17f79d7364d5c88997b03c82b7d44.jpg"><br><br>  In general, getting used to the firmware is not difficult.  It is made logical and understandable, many actions will be familiar to the standard versions of Android.  There are also some bugs, and exactly as described in the MX5 review, but in principle you can live with them and even find out about them from the first one.  Let's just say you need to look for. <br>  Now about the possibilities of video playback and other multimedia features.  With the help of AnTuTu Video Tester, I have checked the exact number of video formats supported.  I propose to get acquainted with the results, they are clearly worth it. <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/91f/2e4/d5f/91f2e4d5fe7849dcb6696f399dc378dc.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fda/539/807/fda53980746e4c0aa8e6464f9f64bad1.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/547/a56/e3e/547a56e3e7544a648b6d66369aea1434.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3aa/a47/838/3aaa47838b11461a96688bd1d4a236b8.jpg"><br><br>  Music player with a pleasant appearance in the style of a general interface.  It is easy to use and friendly with most formats. <br>  Subjectively, the device plays well, I liked it.  Testing of the device took place with headphones Sony-MDR 1R.  The smartphone plays loudly, the volume margin is enough, the sound is not as clear and detailed as the MX5, but clearly better than the Xiaomi Mi4i, for example.  Pleased and the sound of the speaker, both main and voice.  In the case of a voice speaker, I would like to note its volume, you can hear it even slightly from a distance.  No problems with the microphone. <br><br><h2>  <font color="¬´#6aa400¬ª">Wireless interfaces and communication</font> </h2><br>  Following the trend of using two SIM cards, the Meizu M2 Mini is no exception.  Both SIMs can work in 3G / 4G networks and are installed in one tray (nano-SIM).  But to use in 3G / 4G mode you can only have one SIM card out of two, the second will be active only in GSM networks (In which SIM card mode will work, you can choose in the settings).  As mentioned above in the review, if you decide to install a memory card, you will have to sacrifice one SIM card. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/956/82f/4ac/95682f4ac40d474a9fcb6795820813d4.jpg"><br><br>  The following frequencies are supported by the smartphone: GSM / GPRS / EDGE (900/1800 MHz), WCDMA / HSPA + (900/2100 MHz) and LTE (1800/2100/2600 MHz).  In the presence of Wi-Fi (ac, b / g / n) (supports both the 2.4 GHz band and 5.0 GHz), Bluetooth 4.0, as well as GPS (A-GPS) / GLONASS.  All modules are stable, there were no questions with connections. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b18/7c5/7c1/b187c57c12d94a8a8d8065a05120f9b5.jpg"><br><br>  A cold start of GPS takes about one and a half minutes, and a hot one in the region of half a minute.  Accuracy of positioning is excellent, tracking when moving is smooth.  Communication with satellites smartphone tries to keep steadily, in deep-laid tunnels or buildings, of course, the connection may already be interrupted.  Phone and SMS applications do not clearly differ in functionality from older models.  Normally, you can record conversations. <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/01c/f55/5d4/01cf555d40b54d9ba049ce4dfc0d295a.jpg"><br><br>  In Moscow and Moscow region, the signal level of the network is high.  The connection is not lost, the smartphone stably holds the network, even when it comes to connecting to LTE networks.  Although, in the case of the latter, the situation strongly depends on the coverage. <br><br><h2>  <font color="¬´#6aa400¬ª">Battery and running time</font> </h2><br>  Battery Meizu M2 mini has a capacity of 2 500 mAh.  For an energy efficient hardware platform with HD display resolution, the battery life results are quite satisfactory.  The battery in the style of the latest trends - non-removable.  A standard charger has an output of 2 amps.  First of all, I suggest looking at the result of testing autonomy in AnTuTu Tester. <div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">AnTuTu Tester</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/278/983/4d0/2789834d01eb40c58180a7ab500def66.jpg"><br><br></div></div><br><br>  The result can not be called the best among budget smartphones, but the points scored will clearly compete with many middle-class smartphones.  And what about everyday life?  The smartphone lasts for about a day of moderate use, of which 5 - 6 hours is devoted to using the screen.  If you save a charge and do not often turn to the device, then there is a chance to hold out up to two days.  With some kind of continuous active tasks, like games or watching videos at 720p, the smartphone will last 5 or 6-6.5 hours, respectively.  Night "zhor" in standby mode was minimal and did not make up more than 2-3% of the charge. <br><br><h2>  <font color="¬´#6aa400¬ª">Camera</font> </h2><br>  <a href="http://www.icover.ru/catalog/product/smartfon_meizu_m2_mini_m578h_16gb_lte_gray/">Meizu M2 mini</a> is equipped with two cameras.  The main camera with autofocus is intended for photographing the surrounding world, such as landscapes, pets, cars and other components of life.  The front camera is suitable for selfie and video negotiations with a fixed focus.  The main module consists of a 13-megapixel sensor with a 5-element lens and f / 2.2 aperture.  Corning Gorila Glass 3 protects all this beauty. A 5 MP module with a 4-element lens and f / 2.0 aperture is used at the front camera.  A single LED flash on the back cover completes the picture. <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4fe/9cd/17a/4fe9cd17ab0e451b84b5a4a17eecf073.jpg"><br><br>  A few words about the interface of the standard camera application and its functionality.  The application is absolutely convenient.  On the main tab, all the useful and necessary information is neatly presented and logically divided.  There are manual settings, as well as other shooting modes, such as panoramas, focus changes and portrait shots.  Not forgotten the implementation of the adjustment of exposure to tapu. <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/618/b3f/16a/618b3f16a9f643358e688b6de3ee3b75.jpg"><br><br>  In almost all shooting scenarios, the Meizu M2 mini produces a high-quality and clear picture.  Only in the dark to get a suitable snapshot you will have to switch to manual settings, play with the shutter speed and exposure, and also take several shots of the same object in order to get a clear picture, but not something blurred.  However, there is nothing new here, many smartphones of the middle and even higher segment sin when shooting in the dark.  If we talk about the front camera, then everything is like at all ... the pictures are decent looking.  But, unfortunately, the Meizu models are still unable to get rid of noise. <div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Sample pictures</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f64/427/ed4/f64427ed4b0244f981984b8aaf7ad6aa.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9ef/74c/a84/9ef74ca846154eba8c6d68d4e9969b80.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/451/437/9f5/4514379f54024339855a7c58051cef0e.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1c1/817/553/1c1817553a1e4250b94513576006b60b.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bda/e2c/c1b/bdae2cc1b79e4ed1914934ba09e06a66.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ae5/060/464/ae5060464cf24ae8972366be63fe4937.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c04/135/e11/c04135e114c74004af95a96766e37e88.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d62/0e8/570/d620e8570cca47659d89ba89a3cc27e8.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bac/794/ca3/bac794ca3a1946999c43fec9842b8d79.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ce3/d2a/252/ce3d2a2524aa44faa313f847e847e9e9.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/682/166/4b2/6821664b2ebb45eea6f10b32204c5d8a.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f64/0f1/f78/f640f1f781084acdb7217de30b984526.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/45a/ab7/f2e/45aab7f2ea7c4ef4819995309a2f160e.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9b2/c87/958/9b2c87958ab04528945a3769f45e48b3.jpg"><br></div></div><br><br>  Video is written in 720p, as well as in 1080p at 30 frames per second.  At night, a drop in the number of fps up to the ‚Äújerkiness‚Äù of the frame was noticed.  Stabilization is absent.  Sound is recorded in stereo.  The quality of the picture and the level of color for the smartphone of the middle class is quite acceptable. <br><br><h2>  <font color="¬´#6aa400¬ª">Instead of totals</font> </h2><br>  What is the <a href="http://www.icover.ru/catalog/product/smartfon_meizu_m2_mini_m578h_16gb_lte_white/">Meizu M2 mini</a> ?  Compact, moderately productive smartphone with LTE, high-quality camera and a good display.  Of course, when it comes to a five-inch smartphone, it's not customary to talk about compactness, but the trends on large displays dictate their own rules.  In the hands of the smartphone is really cool, ergonomics thought out.  The quality of the parts themselves, the assembly of the device, as well as the positioning of the smartphone, do not allow to doubt that you are holding not a cheap device, but taking into account the dollar and the euro, the price of approximately 13,000 rubles (from the official delivery) will not is great.  All this is supported by a good indicator of battery life.  In my opinion, for someone, Flyme's proprietary shell can probably become a repulsive factor.  But in principle, there is nothing criminal in it and it is quite possible to get used to it.  Of course, the ultimate choice of a smartphone is yours, but I would definitely recommend this instance for consideration. <br><br>  And finally, good news for those who are interested in buying Meizu M2 mini, presented <a href="http://www.icover.ru/search/index.php%3Fq%3D%25D0%25A1%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D1%2582%25D1%2584%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%2BMeizu%2BM2%2Bmini">in different colors</a> .
