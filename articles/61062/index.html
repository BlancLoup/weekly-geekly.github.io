  <section class="page js-page"><h1>"Tax" monetization</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I call tax monetization here a scheme, when, like the state, a service provides users with the infrastructure, a medium for earning, and they earn themselves, and the service removes interest from their income.  <i>In this case, the main question is not how to make the service on users, but how users make money on the service.</i>  Who will come up with the best schemes, he is guaranteed to receive a rapidly growing set of (grateful and loyal) users.  The sharing of advertising revenue with users, for example, in Flexum and recently in LiveJournal, can be interpreted as a variation of this model.  Of the examples where the tax model is the main one are auctions, various exchanges, ‚Äúpeople's banks‚Äù (like <a href="http://www.zopa.com/global/default.htm">Zopa</a> ), consulting services, remote training, start-up services (like <a href="http://www.b-generator.ru/">b-generator</a> ), payment systems, access to user-generated content. for a friend (like <a href="http://web-3.ru/">web-3.ru</a> ). <br><br>  If you look at traditional societies, the tax model is the backbone in their structure.  Although the examples given in the internet seem to be not so small, it still seems to me that the share of this model in comparison with others is insignificant.  The question is - where does such a difference come from?  Below are a few considerations in the piggy bank of this topic. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  In real life, we pay each other because of dependence on each other in terms of professional specialization: the hairdresser goes to the doctor and pays him, and the doctor goes to the hairdresser and also pays, etc. This interaction rarely has such a direct c2c character, usually we We deal with intermediaries - business organizers and sellers.  A great many people take part in the creation and sale of high-tech things, respectively, intermediary structures can be huge and complex.  At the same time, the state takes part of the money that some people pay to others, both from intermediaries and people.  In the virtual world, this would correspond to a certain superservice, which allowed creating specialized services for earning within itself and existed at the expense of taxes from ‚Äúphysical‚Äù and ‚Äúlegal‚Äù entities.  But the conditions for the existence of such a super service on the Internet are noticeably different.  Much of the services in real life are dedicated to the maintenance of people's bodies ‚Äî food, clothing (appearance in general), health, housing, travel (taxis, etc.), leisure / tourism, security, etc. The ‚Äúsecond round‚Äù of service concerns not people, but equipment and infrastructure that they use for bodily needs.  Let us add here the scope of management of all of these (the very intermediaries) and get a huge share of people involved in what is somehow connected with the material, physical component of human existence.  The information component in traditional society also plays an important role - science, education, communication / communications, media, advertising, entertainment, etc. But it is still only a part, a subset of all services.  And since Internet users are people not only from this subset, many of them cannot offer their paid professional services online (except for consulting and monetizing specialized professional content ‚Äî selling it or making money from advertising).

      Total: the lack of a material component in the internet greatly narrows the scope of services, and hence the basis for the tax model.  But what, in principle, can be its weight, on what else it depends? <br><br>  1. One point has already sounded - we need ‚Äúservices of services‚Äù, i.e.  An environment that can be used to build businesses within it.  The same concept of SaaS sets the development in this direction.  There are, for example, services for creating their own online stores.  Although in comparison with the real, this is quite a highly specialized thing - in real life you can rent out the premises, and the entrepreneurs themselves decide that it will be - dentistry, a beauty salon, an office or a store.  I do not see such flexibility in the internet yet.  It's probably a matter of time.  A stand-alone author site is different from what blog services offer, most of which are features, i.e.  more advanced functionality.  It seems that from a technical point of view, even now it is not a problem to make a mass service with very developed functionality.  Approximately it offers Ashmanov in Flexum - users can have a variety of media, blog, forum and search engine in some kind of own portal and make money from advertising.  You can include an online store in this kit.  And then something else.  On this path, we get a library of formats from which to construct the necessary.  It seems to me that, in search of flexibility, one more line of development should be explored - look at the functionality and understand how it can be simplified and unified to primary elements, some ‚Äúatomic information functions‚Äù, and whether the store‚Äôs website differs from the news item from this point of view. site.  Those.  Is it possible to construct a site not mentioned ‚Äúlarge-panel blocks‚Äù such as a blog, forum, store, but from more elementary ‚Äúbricks‚Äù?  For me, an interesting task is also the study of the ‚Äú <a href="http://vrus.habrahabr.ru/blog/56309/">objects + connections</a> ‚Äù environment in the context of this whole subject.  In the end, I think it‚Äôs best to provide users with all possible ways to monetize their activity - advertising, selling content, selling services, tax model (if some users somehow can offer other users additional opportunities for independent earnings), the ‚Äústreet musician‚Äù model "- the service / content is provided free of charge, but who liked it, can pay. <br><br>  2. The Internet and the real can not be regarded as two independent entities.  The same online stores are an example - the Internet is used as an intermediary for handling material goods.  The scheme is also known, when real-time clients sell clients via the Internet.  This intermediary self of Ineta expands the base for the tax model. <br><br>  3. The breadth of use of the tax model depends on the development of payment systems.  In Runet, they are not developed, which is a strong inhibitory factor. <br><br>  4. Braking factor is also the greed and stupidity of the creators and owners of services.  The same SOUP, which allows LiveJournal users to earn money on advertising, <a href="http://mantease.livejournal.com/727.html">decisively rejected</a> this opportunity a year and a half ago.  Mitigation of positions is not surprising, since  This is a natural and obvious trend. <br><br>  5. Although the professional activity of people dominates in the total amount of their activity, but not so much as not to take into account other aspects of human life.  And here the Internet is able to attract and attracts truly massive participation, which can expand the basis for the tax model.  This requires only suitable formats for it.  A possible version of this format, I will present a separate note, so as not to exaggerate the size of this article and not to mix the abstract with the concrete. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/61062/">https://habr.com/ru/post/61062/</a></p>
