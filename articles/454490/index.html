During postgraduate studies at MEI were published in 1932.  the works, one of which was called ‚ÄúOn the capacity of the‚Äú ether ‚Äùand wire in telecommunications‚Äù and was announced to the report of the 1st All-Union Congress on the technical reconstruction of communications and the development of the low-current industry.  The congress did not take place.  It was published in 1933.  as material for the report (accepted for publication in <br>  November 1932.). <a name="habracut"></a>  Which is the official confirmation of priority.  Completing graduate school, Vladimir reported his work to the Academic Council.  The report was approved, the work "On throughput ..." was not understood, "... sort of true, but science fiction." <br><br>  First, this work indicated promising directions for the development of communications, and cut off dead-end directions.  Secondly, in the information aspect of communication problems, the digital transmission of information was mathematically justified, the famous theorem <br>  Kotelnikov.  In fact, this work contained 7 theorems.

      The one that Shannon and his ilk call the "theorem of readings", which he published 15 years later in 1948.  Then, in the 1970s, with the development of electronics, there was a natural surge in interest in digital information transfer.  In 1977  a question arose in the prioritization and the proposed name of the WKS-theorem, Whittaker-Kotelnikov-Shannon. <br><br>  In 1999  The Eduard Rein Foundation, in summing up the outstanding scientific achievements of the 20th century, awarded the prize to the Soviet scientist Vladimir A. Kotelnikov in the nomination ‚ÄúFor Basic Research‚Äù for ‚Äúthe first mathematically precisely formulated and published reading theorem‚Äù. <br><br>  Another interesting point. <br><br>  The name of G. Nyquist emerges, (eng. Harry Nyquist), who was probably one of the first to understand and expressed the idea that the signal samples should differ in time intervals equal to <br>  approximately the inverse of its spectral width.  This often gives reason, especially to Western scholars, to use the term ‚ÄúNyquist sampling rule‚Äù.  But his reasoning was related to the problem of undistorted telegraph signal transmission, although they were close to the problem of transmitting undistorted analog signal transmission.  Professor Luke D. in the article on the occurrence of the sampling theorem points out this: "the first scientist who precisely formulated the sampling theorem and applied it to the problem of communication theory and technology is probably V. Kotelnikov." <br><br>  A small digression and also about priorities. <br><br>  In 1939  Vladimir Alexandrovich created communications equipment on one side lane and assembled on his own, naturally not one, since  the industry refused: ‚ÄúNo one has ever <br>  did.  Was installed but not accepted on the line Moscow-Khabarovsk.  Not accepted: "Easy to overhear."  After reading H. Dudley‚Äôs article, Kotelnikov created speech encryption hardware and <br>  He outlined her idea in the report "Basic Provisions of Automatic Encryption" on June 19, 1941.  This document was the first to formulate requirements for mathematically undecipherable <br>  systems with evidence of the impossibility of decryption.  In the open publication nebylo (and maybe already have?). <br><br>  K. Shannon September 1, 1945  outlined approaches to building strong encryption systems; the report saw the open print in 1949. <br><br>  Brief revision of the ‚ÄúAdvances in Physical Sciences‚Äù, conferences and symposia, July 2006, volume 176, No. 7 <br><br>  <a href="https://yadi.sk/d/TO0tdvXL70wKRw">Detailed material with mathematical calculations can be downloaded here</a> . <br><br>  In conclusion, I can say very often in scientific and practical literature, foreign authors are silent, ascribing to themselves or at least detract from Russian-Soviet-Russian achievements and priorities. <br><br>  The next publication will be a presentation of the materials on the question ‚ÄúWho is the inventor of the radio, Popov or Marconi?‚Äù If I have the same fire in the feed compartment as it is today. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/454490/">https://habr.com/ru/post/454490/</a></p>
