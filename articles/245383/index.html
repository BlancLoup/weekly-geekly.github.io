    <h3>  <a href="http://livegpstracks.com/">Live GPS Tracking</a> (Russia) </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8b0/5d5/37e/8b05d537e8f54204a8d66a78649f592a.jpg"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  The company has been working in the market of satellite monitoring systems since 2010. <br><br>  For private users, the monitoring system is free and provides opportunities to monitor children, the elderly and pets, as well as the opportunity to share information in real time during their trips and travels. <br><br>  The company does not produce its own, but it supports work with a wide range of devices (more than 180 tracker models), including a large set of personal trackers. <br><br>  The company provides a complete working monitoring system that is easily integrated into client sites (without the involvement of IT specialists). <br><br>  <b>Restrictions:</b> up to 4 devices can be connected for free in one account;  story for 6 months;  up to 4 geofences per device. <br><br>  I did not find access to a browser-based system for mobile devices with a low resolution.  But there is a special program for managing devices and viewing trackers on the Mobile Dispatcher map (Android). <br><br>  In addition to the application for smartphones described below, the developer company provides a number of other personal monitoring programs for smartphones: ‚ÄúLive GPS Tracker‚Äù, ‚ÄúGeoMessageService‚Äù. <br><br><h4>  Useful features of the system </h4><br><ul><li>  Mapping: Yandex, OpenStreetMap, Google;  road traffic (Yandex). </li><li>  In the "Favorites" section there are four mini-maps in which you can display the current location of various devices (or the location of the device at different scales of the map). </li><li>  In the additional device information panel, the current speed, azimuth and charge data is displayed by dashboard widgets. </li><li>  The display of tracks can be adjusted taking into account the setting of parameters: parking time, shutdown time, type of movement, ignoring coordinates on cell towers, noise filtering and smoothing. </li><li>  There is a detailed display of the track.  In this mode, for each point you can get detailed information in the information window.  On the map the display of points is accompanied by a marker of the direction of movement.  Points whose coordinates are obtained by cell towers are highlighted with special icons. </li><li>  In the alarm settings panel, notifications are generated for switching the device on and off and entering / exiting geozones. </li><li>  You can set the mode of tracking and centering the map on the selected device. </li><li>  You can create a tracking link for a selected device.  Access to the link can be arranged with password authorization and limit the time during which it is valid.  The created link is a URL and can be accessed from browsers (this link can be integrated into other web pages). </li><li>  Tracks of their devices can be uploaded to various formats: KML (standard, extended);  PLT;  GPX. </li><li>  You can load tracks created on other systems into your storage. </li><li>  Links to tracks from your repository can be published on social networks (Twitter, Facebook, Vkontakte and others). </li></ul><br>  The system also provides additional tools: <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Creating trip itineraries.</b>  Routes can be published for discussion with friends and saved as a track to download to the navigator. </li><li>  <b>Work with points.</b>  You can create, edit and delete your own sets of points.  Points can be accompanied by photos and comments.  Point sets can be exported and imported. </li><li>  <b>Multi cards.</b>  Displaying maps of a single location in various map services (Google Maps, Yandex Maps, Bing Maps, Yahoo Maps, OpenStreetMap, Kosmosnimki, Wikimapia, ProGorod, Visicom).  Including, simultaneous display of one location in two services at the same time is allowed. </li><li>  <b>Converting tracks</b> from one format to another (a set of acceptable formats is very large).  Recalculation of coordinates, calculation of distances between two points. </li></ul><br><h4>  The application for smartphones "RealTimeTracker" </h4><br>  Key features: <ul><li>  You can create a tracking link for a smartphone (similar to tracking links for a selected device in a web application).  Directly from the application, you can share the link through the channels available on the device. </li><li>  The warning mode that the GPS service on the smartphone is disabled. </li><li>  Set the interval of collection of coordinates. </li><li>  Installation of providers of coordinates (GPS or GPS + LBS). </li><li>  Setting the interval for sending coordinates to the server. </li><li>  Setting the battery saving mode (setting the timeout and collecting the coordinates). </li><li>  Setting actions when connecting / disconnecting external power. </li><li>  Setting the mode of recording settings for the current track to a file. </li><li>  Management via SMS commands from the specified numbers (3 numbers). </li><li>  SMS settings to the specified numbers (3 numbers) when you press the SOS button. </li><li>  Set a password to change application settings. </li><li>  Set actions when restarting the smartphone. </li><li>  Setting the indicator in the notification line of the smartphone. </li><li>  Enabling logging of the application in the log. </li></ul><br><h3>  <a href="http://gps-tracker.com.ua/">M2M gps-tracker.com.ua</a> (Ukraine) </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fe5/cf7/2f1/fe5cf72f1e7e446882b3646e12810559.jpg"><br><br>  The project has been operating in the telematics market for five years, launched in 2009. <br><br>  The system can be used for personal monitoring: control of children, the elderly and close people. <br><br>  In addition to its own production devices (M2M Smart, M2M GPS-Tracer), the system provides support for more than three hundred types of various trackers. <br><br>  The company provides licensed software ‚ÄúM2M Profi‚Äù, which is installed on client servers and has the same functionality as gps-tracker.com.ua. <br><br>  <b>Restrictions:</b> free monitoring is carried out to connect users of the mobile version of the Android application to 5 objects;  for organizations of socially significant importance (MES, tourism section, etc.), regardless of the number of connected objects. <br><br><h4>  Useful features of the system </h4><br><ul><li>  Mapping: OpenStreetMap, Google, 2Gis Map, Ovi, Visicom, Luxena, Bing;  road traffic (google). </li><li>  The ability to display on the map of meteorological data for large cities. </li><li>  The search for a location on the map at Geocoder can be selected (Google, OpenStreetMap). </li><li>  Geofences: polygon (convenient option - quickly delete the last created point). </li><li>  Geofences: easy editing, deleting, changing colors, setting the level of transparency, displaying / hiding selected zones on the map.  The ability to export geofences in xml format. </li><li>  A handy tool to add your own objects to the map.  Select an icon.  Automatic address detection.  Object radius  The ability to import objects in CSV format. </li><li>  Ability to add cameras to the map.  View a photo archive of CCTV cameras. </li><li>  The ability to manually enter the coordinates from the device, and display this location on the map. </li><li>  Quickly (from the application window) reference information and the ability to contact technical support is available. </li><li>  At the bottom of the screen, you can show / hide the event log panel (stations) devices.  Information can be displayed with filtering data according to different criteria. </li><li>  Having marked in the device list (the panel in the left part of the application) you need, you can monitor the device group on the map. </li><li>  By selecting a device in the list, you can view and edit information on it (including setting the maximum speed and satellite limit). </li><li>  By selecting a device, you can get an archive of photographs obtained from it. </li><li>  You can create html links to static and dynamic maps with the selected device. </li><li>  The display of the tracks of the selected device can be configured taking into account the parameters set: stop speed (km / h) and stop minimum time (min).  On the map, for points of the track in the information window you can get detailed information.  On the line map of the track is accompanied by a marker of the direction of movement. </li><li>  There is an advanced system for the formation of traffic routes planned for devices. </li><li>  There is an extended event generation system.  You can define a logical condition under which an event is generated.  (the logical condition is described by a formula containing various parameters of the tracker state). </li><li>  Notifications on device events can be configured for various channels of information transfer (log, email, sms, pop-up window, visual notification). </li><li>  It is possible to prepare commands and send them to devices under certain conditions. </li><li>  You can create stopping places on the map (with a description of their names, comments, addresses and coverage radii). </li></ul><br><h4>  The application for smartphones "GPS Tracker official client" </h4><br>  Key features: <ul><li>  Setting the application launch mode when the smartphone is turned on. </li><li>  Set the display of the application icon in the notification bar of the smartphone. </li><li>  Set ip (or domain name) and server port to which data will be transmitted. </li><li>  Setting the data transfer protocol (MAIN or TR-151). </li><li>  Setting the mode of operation ("Tracker", "According to schedule", "Beacon"). </li><li>  Setting the mode of sending data (by time interval, by the angle of rotation, combined). </li><li>  Setting the minimum parking speed. </li><li>  The building of the data transfer interval in traffic and parking. </li><li>  Setting the angle of rotation (to determine the need to send data). </li><li>  Setting the mode of motion analysis on the accelerometer. </li><li>  Setting the mode of work with the Internet connection. </li><li> Setting the battery saving mode (setting the minimum charge percentage at which the application is turned off; setting the timeout (in cases of quiescent / active mode by accelerometer)), after which the GPS service is turned on / off. </li><li>  Setting an application administrator password (control over the ability to change settings and delete an application). </li><li>  Setting the alarm button. </li></ul><br>  <b>In the final parts of the article, I will look at a few more foreign systems and tell you about our <a href="http://www.euler2012.com/apps/vialat_ru.html">ViaLatM</a> system (it will be finalized and updated soon).</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/245383/">https://habr.com/ru/post/245383/</a></p>
