      It all started with the store Virgin Records and Tapes in Notting Hill. <br><br>  From the example of such successful people, one can learn a lot of lessons that can help in choosing one‚Äôs own way of business development and approach to the activity in general. <br><br>  <i><b>‚ÄúChance is given to someone who works a lot.</b></i>  <i><b>The more practice you have in your life, the more success awaits you ‚Äù, - Richard Branson.</b></i> <br><br>  Those who watched the interview with Richard Branson, certainly noticed his calm and even slightly ‚Äúrelaxed‚Äù style of communication.  But behind such external calmness there is hard work and hard work on building a business for many years.  It is clear that its history is not typical, but the fact is that the entrepreneur was ready for something global almost every day because he worked hard in his field of activity. <br><br>  Make sure that you have devoted enough time to work on your progressive thinking and begin to implement the business plan.  To date, there are a large number of "free" sources where you can find information on time management and drawing up a company development strategy.  The many available marketing benefits allow you to analyze the possible risks and difficulties that may arise during the implementation of your business.  Invest in the preparatory stage a maximum of time to fully understand what prospects you expect, and be ready for any development of events. <br><br>  What do you need to do after this?  Right.  To begin.  As they say, the road will be mastered by a walking one, and the best teacher - by experience  To build a business, this expression fits perfectly.  Branson did not finish business school to start a business.  He simply began to study them and learned about all the ‚Äúpitfalls‚Äù and features in the process. <br><br>  <i><b>‚ÄúWork as if there is someone who works 24 hours a day to take everything from you,‚Äù Mark Cuban.</b></i> <br><br>  When building a business, you need to focus on the idea that you believe in.  After all, you probably build a business for some reason?  To raise children.  Ensure the financial future of the family.  Travelling aroun the world.  No matter what goals you pursue, ‚Äúkeep them in your head.‚Äù  They will be some kind of "fuel" that will give energy to move forward.  And when, once again, friends tell you that you are working too hard and it‚Äôs time to relax, remember everything for what / who you are doing, and continue to work hard on the future.  Even if Mark‚Äôs quotation is a metaphor, it‚Äôs better to come to terms with the idea that there is someone who works harder and harder than you and he has a much better chance of success. <br><br>  If you are going to build something really worthwhile, work hard and stay focused.  There is no other option. <br><br>  <i><b>‚ÄúBefore you bring your idea to the masses, understand who you are and what you want to do,‚Äù - Blake Micocci</b></i> <br><br>  Blake Mikoski is the founder of Californian shoe manufacturing company TOMS.  Since its inception in 2006, the company under the One in One program has been giving children in need one pair of shoes from each pair it sold.  The company is currently producing gift shoes in Ethiopia, Kenya, Argentina and Chile, and plans to expand the geography of its charitable activities.  The company profile is quite clear who they are, what they are worth and what they do. <br><br>  You should not just know what your company does.  You must clearly represent the idea behind this activity.  For example, your company produces children's clothes that are three times warmer than those of competitive brands.  In this case, you could describe the activities of your company like this: <br><br>  <i>‚ÄúMy company allows children to save three times more heat than other brands of clothing.</i>  <i>And this means that your children will be less sick, sleep better, and in general they will have a much happier childhood. ‚Äù</i> <i><br></i> <br>  After such a description, even those who have no children will want to buy children's clothing. <br><br>  Your company history should be easy to remember and tell.  You need to understand what is interesting and necessary for your customers and what exactly resonates with them.  So begins the construction of a strong brand. <br><br>  <b><i>‚ÄúCelebrating success is always nice.</i></b>  <b><i>But it‚Äôs much more important to learn from failures, ‚ÄùBill Gates.</i></b> <br><br>  There are failures in the life of each of us.  But before you drop everything and give up your dream, try to learn from the temporary ‚Äúfalls‚Äù. <br><br>  Bill Gates thinks about his failures: <br><br>  <i>‚ÄúThere was a time when I took on too many responsibilities that ultimately‚Äú absorbed ‚Äùme.</i>  <i>My health began to deteriorate, relationships suffered, and eventually we began to experience an acute shortage of staff to perform a huge number of tasks.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>What lesson needed to be learned from that situation?</i>  <i>Forget about excessive pride, ask for help from the environment, instead of being overloaded.</i>  <i>And in the future, the conclusions that I learned from that lesson helped me more than once in business.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Failure is only failure.</i>  <i>Let it happen.</i>  <i>You can make a few mistakes in the past, but don't let them determine the current position of your business. ‚Äù</i> <br><br>  <b>Draw conclusions and move forward.</b> <br><br>  To summarize, entrepreneurs have plenty of ways to succeed.  Good preparation, hard work, thinking through a good company history and extracting the right conclusions from mistakes - all these factors will help you to move far ahead of your competitors and achieve any goals, however impractical they may seem at first glance. <br><br>  Act!  Initiate an idea, invest effort, develop progressive marketing and advertising formats, take enough time to analyze user behavior.  And then your local idea can become comprehensive and grow into a global trend. <br><br> <a href="http://www.byyd.me/ru/register/%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3Dcontent_marketing"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/041/3c5/29a/0413c529a1424210a02b160e54a40e80.png"></a> <br><br>  <a href="http://www.byyd.me/ru/%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr09062016"><b>BYYD ‚Ä¢ Mobile Advertising Platform</b></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/303022/">https://habr.com/ru/post/303022/</a></p>
