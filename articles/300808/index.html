      Today's consumers, before they go to the supermarket or fill out a virtual cart in the online store, turn for ‚Äúadvice‚Äù to online resources.  There, the so-called agents of influence lay out detailed reports and reviews about their buying experience, describe the characteristics of the goods, share their impressions of the use of products.  There are many thematic forums, otzovikov sites, YouTube channels devoted to reviews - home appliances, movies, food and much more. <br><br>  The strength of such recommendations is difficult to overestimate, because, as a rule, they are written on behalf of ordinary users who inspire confidence with their impartiality, or well-known personalities who already enjoy a certain authority in society.  And this approach is gradually turning into a qualitatively new concept - marketing influence. <br><br>  <b>Mobile connects consumers with online influence agents</b> <br><br>  Today's consumer prefers to learn from the mistakes of others and to be ‚Äúfully armed‚Äù.  Before purchasing a product, he reads reviews and reviews about him on the Internet from people who have already seen him in action.  According to the <b>Mobile Marketer</b> study, which was conducted in the field of e-commerce, <b>21% of women watch online reviews from mobile phone screens</b> . <br><br>  In addition, 70% of consumers sometimes, often or even always resort to online reviews while shopping.  What are they guided by? <br><br>  Maintaining a family budget is not an easy thing.  Therefore, 35% of consumers feel the need to refer to online recommendations where you can find information about better purchases.  33% of customers claim that such online consulting helps them to quickly determine the choice of goods. <br><br>  <b>Consumers rely on online reviews for both new products and well-known brands.</b> <br><br>  In particular, women shopping almost do not have online reviews, and 92% of them say that the existence of such online sites is extremely important and useful. <br><br>  As a rule, they resort to online reviews when they buy a previously unknown product, 96% of female consumers point out the importance of online recommendation services when they meet a new brand.  And 78% refer to reviews, even when buying an already known and favorite product. <br><br>  <b>Online reviews have a significant impact on consumer purchasing decisions.</b> <br><br>  As a result of the study, consumers were divided into two ‚Äúcamps‚Äù, approximately 50/50, - those who always turn to online recommendations when buying any goods, and those who read reviews only in certain cases. <br><br>  Buyers do ‚Äúresearch‚Äù reviews on different product categories, <b>91% of women turn to online reviews when searching for home electronics.</b>  If we talk about the subject of recommendation services, then 88% of reviews are devoted to the analysis of the technical characteristics of computers, tablets and smartphones, 87% - of household appliances.  53% of women turn to reviews and when buying toys and games, 44% - household goods. <br><br>  <b>Modern ‚Äúrecommendatory‚Äù culture motivates resourceful buyers.</b> <br><br>  Previous generations have learned about products exclusively through communication emanating from brands.  As the information field is continuously expanding, the possibilities of consumers are increasing.  In the modern world, the number of buyers who turn to online recommendations has increased, and accordingly, the number of people who are willing to actively share their observations about products has increased. <br><br>  Female consumers consider themselves professionals in the field of online research.  98% are sure that they can easily distinguish whether a recall is credible, and 77% consider themselves to be extremely selective in this matter.  <u>It is this confidence that adds additional ‚Äúpoints‚Äù to those brands that skillfully use the recommendation platform in their marketing strategy.</u> <br><br>  <b>Online recommendations go beyond consumer groups</b> <br><br>  The study shows that today's culture of online recommendations goes far beyond the various consumer groups. <br><br>  <b>Mobile Marketer</b> surveyed more than 600 women under 45 for their research.  It was found that <b>more than 95% of respondents are looking for online reviews before making a purchase in order to receive feedback and recommendations from the ‚Äúfirst person‚Äù.</b>  <b>77% go to the official brand groups on Facebook and 74% prefer to purchase a product that received a positive review.</b> <br><br>  The Millennial generation actively headed for a ‚Äúrecommendatory culture‚Äù.  93% of users periodically or constantly refer to online reviews before making purchases.  87% spend ‚Äúown examination‚Äù of the product, reading comments and reviews about products from peers. <br><br>  <b>Mobile as a direct attribute of the people of the XXI century brought the platform reviews to a new level.</b>  <b>Consumers literally ‚Äúconsult‚Äù with the world community before making a purchase.</b>  <b>And this is another huge field for marketing activities on the way to brand promotion.</b>  And how to use such opportunities is up to them. <br><br> <a href="http://www.byyd.me/ru/register/%3Futm_source%3Dmegamozg%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3Dcontent_marketing"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/041/3c5/29a/0413c529a1424210a02b160e54a40e80.png"></a> <br><br>  <a href="http://www.byyd.me/ru/%3Futm_source%3Dmegamozg13052016"><b>BYYD ‚Ä¢ Mobile Advertising Platform</b></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/300808/">https://habr.com/ru/post/300808/</a></p>
