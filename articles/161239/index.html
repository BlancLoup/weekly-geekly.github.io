    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>Q:</b> What's wrong with the old launch? <br>  <b>A: The</b> guys from Microsoft collecting statistics on their OS came to an interesting conclusion - the launch in Windows 7 was used mainly for the Search Box.  The launch itself was terribly uncomfortable, almost nothing could be done in it.  Bill Gates's company realized that it was time to change a lot, since the entire launch functionality could be replaced with a superbar + searchbox bundle.  Many did, and I'm no exception.  But the place on the super-bar was over, I had to put a left clone of the eplow "shelf". <br><br>  <b>Q:</b> Well, it was possible to make something really worthwhile, beautiful and convenient.  Why is it that way? <br>  <b>A:</b> Microsoft set itself a goal - to make a universal OS for tablets, phones and PCs.  Simple, concise and comfortable.  Agree, the best solution was right in front of you: “this is the button”, the need for which has disappeared with each new release - has become ideal for changing the graphical interface to the tablet view. <br><br>  <b>Q:</b> Full-screen start is disgusting, so much empty space.  What for? <br>  <b>A:</b> Then, so that the start menu can be customized exactly as it is convenient for you.  Group icons and tiles.  For me it has become a native and convenient counterpart of the "shelf". <br>  But if you do not like it, you can not use it, just as you did not use it before. <br><br>  <b>Q:</b> Where did the search go? <br>  <b>A: The</b> search works exactly the same - start typing something from the keyboard in the start screen and you will instantly see the grouped results by applications, settings, documents and, not least, in any installed metro application.  Is this separation good or bad for you?  But the new search has become much faster and more functional. <br><br>  <b>Q:</b> I do not understand the meaning of tiles. <br>  <b>A:</b> Tiles are an innovative idea that they were not afraid to demonstrate in the new operating system. <br>  Tiles are label widgets that allow an application to display the most important information for you at its discretion.  This is a natural evolution of labels - static pictures with a link. <br><br>  <b>Q:</b> All these metro applications are not comfortable when using the mouse!  How should I be now? <br>  <b>A:</b> None.  Nobody forces you to use them - they will never replace the desktop environment.  Microsoft is well aware of this. <br><br>  <b>Q:</b> Is there anything new besides the metro and quick launch? <br>  <b>A:</b> In the explorer, for example, there was a Ribbon-tape with the most important and frequent settings - including the checkboxes “show extensions for registered files” and “show hidden files” (just click View-&gt; Show X) <br>  Just made a single file manager.  Improved the definition of time when copying a file, made a graph of speed. <br>  And they made a new Task Manager.  Convenient and with graphs, but they have not deleted the old one either, you can call it by writing its name in the run (win + r) window. <br><br>  <b>Q:</b> 2 control panels, the off and reboot button is not clear where.  Why is it that way? <br>  <b>A:</b> Alas, not everything is as smooth as we would like.  Microsoft had to divide the settings into “Metro Settings” and “Normal Control Panel”.  And for the sake of touch screens, the main settings of the computer were transferred to the Charm-panel. <br>  Including for ideological reasons. <br><br>  <b>Q:</b> Why didn't they give a choice to users, whether we want it all or not? <br>  <b>A:</b> Microsoft is a commercial company, and not least it is thinking about promoting its promising areas. <br><br>  I hope I answered the most important questions about the metro-environment on desktop. <br>  Please send all typos / errors in PM.  As well as supplement the article with your urgent questions. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/161239/">https://habr.com/ru/post/161239/</a></p>
