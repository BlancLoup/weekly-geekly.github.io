Sounds unbelievable, but true.  Survey platforms (in translation from English - ‚ÄúReview Platforms‚Äù), accumulate in their catalogs the most popular content about software, services, hardware and collect reviews of the real users of these information technology solutions.  Now, when choosing IT products, CIO is not only interested in the opinion of specialists, but also browses the web pages of these independent information sources. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  You can call them differently: Review Platform, Review as Service, Technology Research Services, ‚ÄúIT Yelp‚Äù or survey platforms - but the pattern is similar. <br><br>  For the user, as we have already mentioned, these services are free, they provide analytics of the position of products on the market by function and niche.  But nevertheless, just as users are the aggregator of the most valuable content - reviews, and also appear at different levels as a source of monetization of platforms.  After all, another Review Platform target audience is manufacturers who not only find their brand‚Äôs advocates on such web services.

      Manufacturers often pay platforms for various additional services: gathering information about the needs of potential users, options for representing products on the platform, conducting surveys, receiving requests from potential users (Lead Generation), checking the quality of the lead phone call, receiving new success stories.  Sometimes the Pay Per Click (PPC) click pay model is used. <br><br>  Survey platforms are also armed with tools such as Sales Enablement for IT vendors, giving information about products, their experience in using them. <br><br>  Some products use Artificial Intellect technology to collect and analyze feedback and integrate with CRM to place feedback and query management (Leads Management) into commercial proposals. <br><br>  Technology feedback collection eliminates fake accounts and reviews.  Identification of the real users of the product occurs by various methods: a phone call, screenshots of the products used, linkedin verification, etc. <br><br>  Some platforms offer real users a reward for recalling about 10 USD and are ready to transfer this money to charity at the user's request. <br><br>  Despite the fact that the Review Platform helps in the selection and comparison of IT products and services, Review Platform itself is not very willing to compare.  But we, being one of those, will try) and consider 5 platforms with similar functionality, containing a catalog of IT products and information about user experience.  You can see the complete Review Platform review in <a href="https://roi4cio.com/nc/produkty/sravnit/%3Ftemplate%3D75%26p%255B2234%255D%3D2234%26p%255B2206%255D%3D2206%26p%255B2208%255D%3D2208%26p%255B2210%255D%3D2210%26p%255B2212%255D%3D2212%26p%255B2214%255D%3D2214%26p%255B2216%255D%3D2216%26p%255B2218%255D%3D2218%26p%255B2220%255D%3D2220%26p%255B2222%255D%3D2222%26p%255B2224%255D%3D2224%26p%255B2226%255D%3D2226%26p%255B2228%255D%3D2228%26p%255B2230%255D%3D2230%26p%255B2232%255D%3D2232">our comparative 15 Review Platform table</a> . <br><br><h2>  Getapp </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xb/w5/ge/xbw5geu0nz1ex8289sjubcmicv4.png"><br><br>  <b>Product categories:</b> SaaS software <br>  <b>Reviews:</b> pros and cons, value for money, ease of use, functional options, support <br>  <b>Rating:</b> based on reviews <br>  <b>Product comparison:</b> functionality, prices, reviews - no more than 4 products at the same time <br>  <b>Product information:</b> functionality, price, screenshots, video review <br>  <b>Selection of products:</b> recommendation services based on used <br>  <b>Verification: Yes</b> <br><br>  Features: <br><br>  The project is dedicated to SaaS services.
