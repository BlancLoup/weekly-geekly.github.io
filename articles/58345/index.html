  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Music: network deposits</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The process of Pirate Bay and its results - this is an occasion to think about other ways to get content.  If we talk about music, then the easiest way is to buy it in iTunes.  This method has a significant drawback - it naturally limits the consumption of music.  The need to pay for each track leads to thoughts about whether it is needed.  There are other options that do not lead to such restrictions.  These are either services where music can be listened to and downloaded for free, or services with a subscription, where a one-time fee is paid, regardless of the number of songs heard.  Even if it is not economically profitable, there is no element of psychological pressure: you know that after listening to another track you will not pay extra money - and in this sense you are free, although you have to pay money for this freedom.  Recently, the number of services that the first, that the second type began to increase.  Below is a brief overview of several of these services, based on the notes of the author and his colleagues in the publication <a href="http://ruformator.ru/">‚ÄúRuformator‚Äù</a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>Last.fm</b> <br>  <a href="http://www.last.fm/">Last.fm</a> - the most famous of the services in question - needs no introduction.  However, now to use it fully, you need to pay three euros per month.  For three euros you can listen to the radio.  This means that you can listen to a stream of music files in a particular style or similar to the records of your favorite artist.  However, it is not possible to regulate this stream and order a specific song or even a specific artist. <br>  <i>Pros: relative cheapness (3 euros per month), educational function (listening to the radio, you will learn new artists in your favorite style), sociality.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Cons: the service has become paid, without adding new features.</i>  <i>Listen to what you want at the moment can not.</i> <br>  Ruformator: <a href="http://ruformator.ru/news/article05165/default.asp">Last.fm makes the free version useless</a> . <br><br>  <b>Spotify</b> <br>  <a href="http://www.spotify.com/">Spotify has no</a> last drawback.  In it, you can listen to what you want - and immediately.  It is possible to listen to the radio by genre or by year (for example, ask only for funk and reggae - and only the eighties).  The Spotify catalog contains all the records of Universal and Warner Music - and with the help of a search you can listen to any artist, any album, any song - as long as they come out on these major music.  There is a free version (at the same time, listening every 20 minutes is interrupted by advertising) and paid - there are no such restrictions.  Unfortunately, in Russia free is not available. <br>  <i>Pros: a lot of music that you can listen to without any restrictions.</i>  <i>Having one account, you can listen from multiple computers (not simultaneously).</i>  <i>Giant media collection is always available - if only there is Internet.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Cons: high cost (10 euros per month or 100 per year).</i>  <i>There are no other labels - what happened on EMI and Sony won't be listened to.</i>  <i>Russian performers on majors were published very little - with them also a bummer.</i>  <i>Unlike Last.fm, the system does not issue recommendations.</i>  <i>Nothing can be downloaded.</i>  <i>You can not listen to the player - the application in which Spotify works only exists for desktop Mac and Windu - nothing will work out of Linux either.</i> <br>  Ruformator: <a href="http://ruformator.ru/news/article05216/default.asp">record companies hit piracy with a ruble</a> .

      <b>Yota media</b> <br>  <a href="http://www.yota.ru/ru/media/">Yota Media</a> is a WiMax provider catalog, which currently has 629412 tracks.  Its device is similar to Spotify - only without the application, everything works right in the browser.  You can listen to absolutely no limits <br>  <i>Pros: free for now.</i>  <i>Come across our performers.</i>  <i>Cross-platform and no need for additional software</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Cons: as in Spotify there is no flexible tagging system.</i>  <i>Ten genres - that's all.</i>  <i>While it is in beta, all is well.</i>  <i>As soon as it comes out of beta, there can be ridiculous restrictions, advertising, anything.</i>  <i>While not covered - you can safely use.</i> <br>  Ruformator: <a href="http://ruformator.ru/news/article05143/default.asp">Yota media services are open to everyone</a> . <br><br>  <b>Jamendo</b> <br>  <a href="http://jamendo.com/">Jamendo</a> is a very famous and middle-aged project, which recently had a Russian-language interface.  Unlike the previous ones, it does not provide any desktop application or a special browser window with which you can navigate in this collection.  Only the web interface, the search - by artists, genres and tags - and many hours (only full albums here are more than 18,000, and there are still some songs) of high-quality music released under various Creative Commons licenses.  You will not find famous performers here - but you can learn many new names in your favorite genre. <br>  <i>Pros: free.</i>  <i>Good tagging system.</i>  <i>Many new names that sound fresh and high quality.</i>  <i>Everything can be downloaded or listened to online.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Minuses: if you are familiar with the genre only superficially - it will not be easy: you will not find luminaries here.</i> <br>  Telnews: <a href="http://telnews.ru/dvas/c79467/">Jamendo - as an artist, make money from free music</a> . <br><br>  <b>Kroogi</b> <br>  <a href="http://www.kroogi.com/">Kroogi</a> is a Russian crowdfunding experiment.  Its creator, Miroslav Sarbaev, was still working in that Napster.  So this is a very old and respected pirate.  In Circles, everything is legal: performers post their songs, users download and discuss, form circles of interest.  At the same time, downloading the album, you can make an arbitrary donation (generally speaking, musicians have the opportunity to limit it from below).  The musicians on Kroogi are mostly Russian - Tequilajazz, Aquarium, Rada and Ternovnik. <br>  <i>Pros: free of charge, but the artist you like can be marked by donation.</i>  <i>You can find a community of like-minded people with similar tastes.</i>  <i>Music can be downloaded in high enough quality.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Cons: mostly domestic musicians.</i>  <i>While not too diverse.</i> <br>  Telnews: <a href="http://telnews.ru/dvas/c76751/">Kroogi - a social network that helps artists make money</a> . <br><br>  In addition to already functioning projects, there are quite young ones.  Nothing is clear with them yet - only the core of functionality has been outlined.  It‚Äôs too early to talk about the pros and cons. <br><br>  <b>Free frog</b> <br>  <a href="http://www.freefrog.ru/">Free Frog</a> is a very ambitious project.  While in words.  It was made by people who created Mp3Search.ru - and it is stated that a million dollars was spent on it.  While it is unclear on what - the website consists of an undeveloped Dolphin CMS with glitches falling out in different places, and among the stars in it you can only find the group Demo.  The highlight of the project: users can both share free content with each other, and sell paid (music, photos, even lyrics).  Of course, formally required to have the right to such activities. <br>  Ruformator: <a href="http://ruformator.ru/news/article0529B/default.asp">Free Frog - Russian MySpace</a> . <br><br>  <b>LoudCloud.fm</b> <br>  <a href="http://loudcloud.fm/">LoudCloud.fm</a> is a social network in which different artists can upload their music, and users can rate and comment on it.  There is a system of division by genres and tags.  Content is filtered, which allows to hope for its quality.  For the time being, however, groups of unknowns are lined up and, to put it more accurately, different. <br>  Ruformator: <a href="http://ruformator.ru/news/article05299/default.asp">LoudCloud is a social platform for music lovers</a> . <br><br>  <b>Soundcloud</b> <br>  <a href="http://soundcloud.com/">SoundCloud</a> is a service where musicians can upload music.  It would seem, just a music hosting.  As an independent service, it cannot be considered - however, the word Cloud in the title is not accidental.  This is a convenient framework with which you can create social communities.  The player, through which the files uploaded to SoundCloud are played, can be embedded into any web page.  He also allows commenting of an arbitrary moment in the track.  In addition, a musician, uploading a file to the sound cloud, can provide it with a link to a video, a link for free download or purchase, and specify which license the content is distributed to - standard Copyright, any modern Creative Commons or ‚ÄúNo rights reserved‚Äù. <br>  Ruformator: SoundCloud is a <a href="http://ruformator.ru/news/article0529E/default.asp">universal network for musicians</a> . <br><br>  <b>Mooozone</b> <br>  <a href="http://moozone.com/">Moozone</a> - this is the last service, which will be discussed in this review.  He is different from everyone else.  In its spirit it is almost p2p.  Here, it is not the performers who share files with the listeners, but listeners with each other - it is argued that on legal grounds.  How so?  The fact is that when a user lays out a track and decides who can listen to it, the track becomes available, but only partially.  At the same time, only one person can listen to an audio file, it is shown to all others as inaccessible until the audition is finished.  Thus, only one person at a time listens to music and there is a chance (for the time being this is not clear) that the requirements of the legislation are satisfied.  Although it is clear that in fact one ‚Äúextra‚Äù copy is created: no one controls whether the uploaded file has been deleted from its hard drive. <br>  Ruformator: <a href="http://ruformator.ru/news/article05295/default.asp">Moozone teaches sharing in a new way</a> . <br><br>  Problems of torrent trackers make people look at the world wider.  Someone is ready for a hundred euros a year to receive all the music of the leading labels on Spotify.  Others are ready to dig into the deposits of Jamendo and learn new things.  And someone enough to follow your favorite artist in the "Circles".  Life is richer than boring music stores with rows of identical discs on one side and torrents on the other. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/58345/">https://habr.com/ru/post/58345/</a></p>
