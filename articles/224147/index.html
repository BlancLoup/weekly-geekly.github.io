Choose one - you will not get to others.  What to do? <br><br>  In the case of the Positive Hack Days International Security Forum, this problem can be resolved by reviewing the performances of interest on record.  This will be especially true for those who did not get to the conference at all.  All video files are on the website: <a href="http://phdays.ru/broadcast/">phdays.ru/broadcast/</a> .

      However, to watch the recordings of all the halls in a row, for both days, this is an option for very-patient people.  It is more logical to look at the topics or the authors: first read the descriptions of the reports in the <a href="http://www.phdays.ru/program/schedule/">program</a> , and then select a specific report in the video list. <br><br>  Here, however, it is necessary to understand: the descriptions were written before the conference, when it was still unknown how good this or that report would be.  Maybe he only has a cool name, but inside - boring? .. Therefore, we offer you a third way: in popularity.  We analyzed the feedback from participants PHDays and collected a dozen of the most successful reports.  Here they are: <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  1) ‚ÄúBig data in social networks: special NSA surveillance is not required for you‚Äù </h4><br>  Igor Ashmanov, an artificial intelligence expert, began the report by saying that he himself was not interested in information security and came to the conference by chance.  But then he told so many interesting things about studying people through social networks that the audience did not let him go even an hour after the end of the report.  Especially quoted on the Internet are slides about the composition of the ‚ÄúNavalny gang‚Äù, as well as the rating of <a href="https://twitter.com/4rt3m/status/469066322220167168/photo/1">liberal</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/4rt3m/status/469066919824601088/photo/1">patriotic media</a> based on an analysis of reposts on Twitter and Facebook. <br><br>  Video: <a href="http://live.digitaloctober.ru/embed/2990">http://live.digitaloctober.ru/embed/2990#time1400666542</a> <br><br><h4>  2) ‚ÄúLife after Snowden.  Modern Internet intelligence tools ¬ª </h4><br>  If in the Ashmanov report, social networks were used for generalized research, then the head of the competitive intelligence section of the Academy of Information Systems, Andrei Masalovich, showed techniques for more targeted collection of confidential data.  Many examples were shown live on Pentagon sites.  And the most cited slide from the report is the collection of passport scans by a <a href="https://twitter.com/a_kushakova/status/469455194485714944/photo/1">simple search on Vkontakte</a> . <br><br>  Video: <a href="http://live.digitaloctober.ru/embed/2999">http://live.digitaloctober.ru/embed/2999#time1400760000</a> <br><br><h4>  3) ‚ÄúHow to eavesdrop on a person on the other side of the globe‚Äù </h4><br>  Of course, the publication of telephone conversations of well-known politicians is a very fashionable topic in the press, and it was not by chance that the title of the report appeared.  However, the experts of Positive Technologies Dmitry Kurbatov and Sergey Puzankov told not only about wiretapping, but also about many other hacker possibilities in the SS7 signaling network - including DoS attacks, fraud, money transfer, SMS interception and subscriber location without his knowledge. <br><br>  Video: <a href="http://live.digitaloctober.ru/embed/2990">live.digitaloctober.ru/embed/2990#time1400670335</a> <br><br><h4>  4) ‚ÄúComparison of hackers from Iran, China and North Korea‚Äù </h4><br>  William Hayjstad served in the US Marine Corps for more than 20 years, and now he is a major specialist in military cyber technologies in various countries.  He began his report in Chinese - as an example of another culture that is completely incomprehensible to Western people, including information security issues.  Further speech can be simply disassembled into quotations: ‚ÄúIf you have a question, stop me and ask right away, because I love the multitasking mode.‚Äù  It is difficult to present such a vivid report performed by, say, a representative of the Russian Ministry of Defense ... Although, maybe, they will accept the challenge and answer at the next PHDays conference? <br><br>  Video: <a href="http://live.digitaloctober.ru/embed/2996">live.digitaloctober.ru/embed/2996#time1400756290</a> <br><br><h4>  5) "State and information security" </h4><br>  The organizers invited very different people to this round table: here were a representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, a member of the Federation Council, the head of the Coordination Center of the national domain, a researcher from the HSE, the head of an analytical company, and two hackers.  The section moderator, the former chief editor of Webblanet magazine, Alexey Andreev, suggested that those who gathered should speak about new laws regulating the Internet, but not in general terms, but in the language of security.  Why is a blogger, once gained 3000 readers, suddenly it turns out to be dangerous?  Why Russia will never join the Budapest Convention on the fight against cyber crime?  Where is ICANN's golden egg hiding?  How much is hacking a mailbox Yarosh?  It turned out messy, but interesting. <br><br>  Video: <a href="http://live.digitaloctober.ru/embed/2996">live.digitaloctober.ru/embed/2996#time1400738565</a> <br><br><h4>  6) ‚ÄúIntercepter-NG: New Generation Sniffer‚Äù </h4><br>  Alexander Dmitrenko, the head of the PentestIT training department, spoke about the development of the ‚Äúmost advanced tool for recovering data from traffic‚Äù.  Schemes of some obscure attacks were dismantled.  The author of the sniffer, presented as Ares, was in correspondence with Edward Snowden, who was interested in the work of this tool with large data arrays.  Thus, it turned out that Western children play Russian toys! <br><br>  Video: <a href="http://live.digitaloctober.ru/embed/2991">live.digitaloctober.ru/embed/2991#time1400677520</a> <br><br><h4>  7) ‚ÄúOn the search for zero-day binary vulnerabilities in 2014‚Äù </h4><br>  This year, PHDays had a lot of hacker girls (or security specialists).  Here and the Korean team CTF, consisting of some girls, and experts on the <a href="https://twitter.com/3dwave/status/469042651631996928/photo/1">nursery SORM</a> , and the finalists of the <a href="https://twitter.com/jamadharma/status/469531724414992384/photo/1">Young School</a> .  But Alisa Shevchenko, head of Esage Lab's own company, distinguished herself at this conference twice.  She not only read a report on her own fuzzing techniques with examples of ‚Äúholes‚Äù in Microsoft Word and Microsoft XML, but also won the Critical Infrastructure Attack competition, finding several serious vulnerabilities in the latest versions of real SCADA systems.  At the same time, according to Alice, the search for binary vulnerabilities is not her main job: just a hobby "for a couple of hours in the evening." <br><br>  Video: <a href="http://live.digitaloctober.ru/embed/3000">live.digitaloctober.ru/embed/3000#time1400742033</a> <br><br><h4>  8) "Impression: do not break, make your key" </h4><br>  Representatives of the American Open Organization of lock hackers (the abbreviation <a href="http://toool.us/">TOOOL</a> stands for <a href="http://toool.us/">it</a> ) came to PHDays for the second time.  For two days, their tables were constantly surrounded by a crowd.  What most people saw only in the cinema, you could try it yourself: crack the classic door lock with a pair of simple metal hooks.  This year the TOOOL team not only showed the work with master keys, but also the impression technique: to open the lock, we only need a key blank, a sharp eye and a file. <br><br>  Video: <a href="http://live.digitaloctober.ru/embed/2996">live.digitaloctober.ru/embed/2996#time1400760340</a> <br><br><h4>  9) "SCADA Strangelove: hacking in the name of" </h4><br>  Sergey Gordeychik and six other Positive Technologies experts told several stories about vulnerabilities in automated control systems used in various fields: here both electricity meters, and oil producing enterprises, and even the hadron collider.  Vendors are also different - ABB, Emerson, Honeywell, Siemens.  Over the two years of working with SCADA systems, the company discovered more than 200 zero-day vulnerabilities, but only those that could be talked about were chosen for the presentation, because the manufacturers had already eliminated them.  Speakers hinted that they have many more such stories for next year. <br><br>  Video: <a href="http://live.digitaloctober.ru/embed/2990">live.digitaloctober.ru/embed/2990#time1400663085</a> <br><br><h4>  ten).............. . </h4><br>  Void in tenth place is not a mistake.  We just decided to offer you to choose what should be written here.  What report on PHDays IV did you personally like most?  Suddenly we missed something?  Tell us in the comments! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/224147/">https://habr.com/ru/post/224147/</a></p>
