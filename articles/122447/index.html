  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Inverser - APOZH for Android</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  APOZH is a rather funny musical game from the program ‚ÄúGood Jokes‚Äù, which was played on STS by Mikhail Schatz, Tatyana Lazareva and Alexander Pushnoy. <br><br>  If someone does not remember, then the meaning of the game is to guess the song that the other person sang.  In this case, the task is complicated by the fact that the person who guesses hears only the recorded song turned upside down, and, in order to understand what the song is, he repeats in parts what he hears.  As a result, all the parts are glued together, the recording itself turns over in the right direction, and the player tries to guess the original song. <br><br>  It's easier to watch the recording of the original program in order to understand what's what.  This is probably the most famous APOJ entry with Pryanikov and Ivanushki-international - <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DM3mkUyJMw2I">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3mkUyJMw2I</a> .

    <img src="http://inverser.org/images/00681.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  At one time, I used the laptop, an external microphone, additional speakers, Adobe Audition, and fast hands to perform APOJ.  But it was extremely inconvenient: I needed skill, speed, and also a lot of equipment with me. <br><br>  And so, before the last weekend, my friends sent me a link to their new Android program, <b>Inverser</b> . <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  About the game </h4><br>  Without thinking twice, I immediately installed the <a href="https://market.android.com/details%3Fid%3Dru.steadycom.android.inverser">full version of</a> Inverser on my Desire (it costs only 55 rubles) with the hope of having fun at the weekend.  It is worth noting that the program also has a <a href="https://market.android.com/details%3Fid%3Dru.steadycom.android.inverser_lite">free version</a> .  As I understand it, the lite-version differs from the paid one by the presence of a number of time restrictions and the presence of advertising, but this version is enough to evaluate the game. <br><br>  Losing details about all my adventures at the weekend, I will describe the overall impression of Inverser. <br><br>  The game as a whole really liked: <br><ol><li>  Simple and nice interface. </li><li>  Normal, from my point of view, usability.  Navigation is done with both fingers and joystick. </li><li>  The availability of help allows you to quickly understand the gameplay (although video on working with the program would not hurt). </li><li>  Settings allow you to set several parameters: the maximum possible recording length of the original song;  the lengths of the parts into which this song will be divided after turning;  application language - Russian, English (by the way, it's more pleasant to play on it) and German (for me, weird choice) are available;  sampling rate, which is responsible for sound quality. </li></ol><img src="http://inverser.org/images/screenshot_1.png" alt="image"><img src="http://inverser.org/images/screenshot_2.png" alt="image"><img src="http://inverser.org/images/screenshot_3.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="http://inverser.org/images/screenshot_4.png" alt="image"><img src="http://inverser.org/images/screenshot_5.png" alt="image"><img src="http://inverser.org/images/screenshot_6.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The gameplay itself is quite simple and consists of four steps: <br><ul><li>  Record the original song. </li><li>  Record in parts of an inverted song. </li><li>  Listening to the glued parts and guessing the newly inverted recording. </li><li>  Comparison of the original recording and recording, resulting from these simple manipulations. </li></ul>  As a result, they played Inverser with friends at the dacha by a rather large company.  It was very fun, and it was especially funny to listen to inverted versions of songs. <br><br>  The only thing that would be advised is that if you are thinking of playing Inverser, then take with you external speakers (special telephone numbers are possible), but the speaker built into the phone is not very loud for a large room. <br><br>  If we say that I personally did not really like the application, it is the impossibility of changing the length of the parts during the game itself (to change this setting, you need to go to the menu, thereby losing the already recorded original song).  In addition, judging by the reviews on the Android Market, Inverser may not work on some devices with custom firmware. <br><br>  It is also worth noting that the developers promise in the future to add the ability to save recorded songs, as well as the ability to manually split an inverted song into fragments. <br><br><h4>  Where to find? </h4><br>  Game site: <a href="http://www.inverser.org/">http://www.inverser.org</a> . <br><br>  QR codes of paid and free versions: <br><br> <a href="https://market.android.com/details%3Fid%3Dru.steadycom.android.inverser"><img src="http://inverser.org/images/code1_paid.png" alt="image"></a> <a href="https://market.android.com/details%3Fid%3Dru.steadycom.android.inverser_lite"><img src="http://inverser.org/images/code1.png" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  In general, if you are tired of playing the Crocodile, are tired of swearing at each other when playing Mafia, and you just want to diversify your ‚Äúbooze party‚Äù, then Inverser should help you with this. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/122447/">https://habr.com/ru/post/122447/</a></p>
