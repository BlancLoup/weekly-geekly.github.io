Typically, such a viewing is organized by downloading files from the phone to a PC, and viewing it already on the computer display.  Sometimes files are downloaded from the phone to a USB flash drive, and viewed on TV - that's even better.  But all this takes time, and this is just inconvenient.  A similar problem arises in people who move around a lot and often live in hotels - it's nice to watch movies on a big TV, not on a laptop screen.  But the hotel TV does not always recognize the flash drive, and not the fact that the TV will have a USB input.  You can connect via HDMI, but you don‚Äôt want to carry the extra wire with you. <br><br>  A more convenient way is to organize the direct transfer of any video files from a smartphone to a TV using a gadget. <br>  It would seem that there is a fairly large selection of devices that connect to the HDMI connector on the TV and receive a signal via WiFi. <br>  So we decided that such a device meets the requirements for dadzhetami (useful, electronic, simple interface) and it must be entered into the range.  And here it turned out that not everything is so simple. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  We tested a dozen of these gadgets.  Along with all sorts of noname-devices, tested Tronsmart T1000, iCast Mirror, Phone TV.  Three of the tested gadgets did not want to work at all.  Of the seven others, the majority either didn‚Äôt support all protocols, or didn‚Äôt work with all types of mobile devices and / or was buggy during configuration or operation.  There was also a problem with the complexity of the initial setup.

      The only (really unique) device that worked correctly and conveniently turned out to be a device, <a href="http://dadget.ru/katalog/multimedia/videomost">called ‚ÄúVideo bridge‚Äù</a> , which I would like to tell about below. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8a5/fc5/300/8a5fc530046d992445aec9ce678d50b0.jpg"><br><br><h3>  How it works? </h3><br>  It is very easy to configure Video-Video; you only need to establish a connection with a smartphone once (a couple of minutes), after which the viewing can be organized almost instantly. <br><br>  All you need to get started is to connect the Video Bridge via the HDMI connector to the TV.  Power can be supplied via USB (by connecting to an adapter or to a port on the same TV, if available).  After that, the corresponding application is installed on the smartphone or tablet, and that‚Äôs it - the system is ready for use.  There are applications for Android, Windows, iOS. <br><br>  For data transmission using wireless communication standard Wi-Fi 802.11n (only supported 2.4 GHz band). <br><br>  "Video bridge" supports most popular standards for the transmission of multimedia signals, namely: <br><ul><li>  <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/AirPlay">AirPlay</a> function; </li><li>  <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miracast">Miracast</a> function; </li><li>  <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/DLNA">DLNA</a> function. </li></ul><br>  It is worth noting that <b>there are not many similar devices on the market that combine Airplay and Miracast protocols</b> . <br><br><h3>  How easy is that? </h3><br>  I tried to use the Video Bridge on my own, plus a couple more people got this device at their disposal.  Setup and installation of even the most "dense" in technical terms, the user (female, blonde hair) did not take more than 5 minutes.  Everything is very simple. <br><br>  After installation, everything works as it should.  There are no extra "ryushechek" - only the main function: the transfer of the image from a mobile device to the TV.  The instruction is not particularly needed, although it is included. <br><br><h3>  Specifications </h3><br><ul><li>  Processor: AM8521; </li><li>  Memory capacity: 128 MB; </li><li>  Power supply: 5 V / 0.5 A; </li><li>  Linux support: Linux 3.0.8; </li><li>  Mac and iOS support: iOS 6.0 and above, MAC OS 10.7 and above </li><li>  Windows support: XP SP3 and above </li><li>  File format <br>  <b>Video</b> : AVI / DIVX / MKV / TS / DAT / MPG / MPEG1,2,4 / MP4 / RM / RMVB / W MV <br>  <b>Audio</b> : MP1 / MP2 / MP3 / WMA / OGG / ADPCM-WAV / PCM-WAV / AAC <br>  <b>Photo</b> : HD JPEG / BMP / GIF / PNG / TIFF </li></ul><br><h3>  What is Video Bridge capable of? </h3><br>  This device has only one function - the transfer of image and sound from the phone to the TV.  There is nothing else.  In principle, there are options for using this function: <br><br><ul><li>  Broadcast the contents of the mobile device on the big screen without wires; </li><li>  Using TV as a sound enhancement on a smartphone; </li><li>  Presentation of presentations on the big screen. </li></ul><br>  As for the presentations - this is more applicable to all sorts of companies and corporations.  Most have a projector, so few people will use the phone to transfer data to the TV (although, why not, if there are no other options?). <br><br><h3>  Are there any analogues? </h3><br>  As already described at the beginning of the article, there are analogues.  The problem is that in this price range, many analogs do not work correctly, or are difficult to configure or use.  There are options in a wider functionality, but they are, as a rule, much more expensive than <a href="http://dadget.ru/katalog/multimedia/videomost">Video Bridge</a> . <br><br>  =================== <br><br><h3>  Invitation to test dadzhetov </h3><br>  The djadget invites authors interested in testing our devices and writing an objective review for cooperation.  The device after the publication of the review remains with you.
