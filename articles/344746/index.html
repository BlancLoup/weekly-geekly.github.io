Is milk chocolate and passion fruit sauce suitable for marbled beef?  No, we were not mistaken by the site and do not even want to make fun of you before Friday evening.  But yes, we want to talk about food, about ‚Äúfood computing‚Äù and how you can help us where artificial intelligence is powerless.  Just tell us about your tastes.  Even if they are very specific ... <br><br> <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/ruvds/blog/344746/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/mm/mi/kz/mmmikzroozktynvsicobttrmj8s.jpeg"></a> <br>  <font color="#999999"><i>Burger Heroes <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2qXvl8qc0zcbWo0REpSRjNiU2s/view">Bad Bro</a> Burger</i></font> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  All the perversions we named were invented by artificial intelligence - namely, the <a href="https://www.ibmchefwatson.com/tupler">IBM Chef Watson system</a> (by the way, the <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/ibm/blog/229285/">article about it on Habr√©</a> was already three years ago).  The program's interface is extremely simple: you select the ingredients by category, add style and mood - then the neural chef adds its ingredients and gives you an unusual, but relatively harmonious dish.  However, it is immediately clear that the computer future of the kitchen has been forced to stop at the multicookers and other smart appliances.  Or not right away? <br><br>  Let's figure it out.  Here are the benefits of IBM Chef Watson that chefs and cooking experts reveal: 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
    <ul><li>  You can enter the most strange and ridiculous ingredients, for example, on the basis of residues in the refrigerator and get a fairly normal combination.  For example, one expert noted pancakes with eggplants and caper and fennel salad (although he did not dare to follow the recommendations to flavor this cocoa business). <br></li><li>  You can have fun.  So, the journalist decided to conduct an experiment and feed the guests exactly by advising IBM Chef Watson, without prescribing their ingredients.  The menu was excellent: cherry-tomato gazpacho, paella made from salmon, rice, mussels and figs knows what else, and ice cream made from butter, garlic and curry powder.  Such combinatorics can amuse, but no more. <br></li><li>  If you are adequate and choose the ingredients that you really can eat, you get wonderful dishes - a cut above those that we usually cook.  The fact is that IBM Chef Watson is based on "synergy of combinations" and research into combinations of different tastes and compositions.  For example, if you choose honey and coconut, you can get baklava with orange zest, walnuts, hazelnuts, butter, pepper and darjeeling (tea) in one of the iterations.  And it is delicious - anyone who has ever tried nuts with honey and hot hot pepper or just hot pepper with honey will say. <br></li></ul><br>  Do you think this is just a fan, or in this culinary joke only a fraction of the joke, and the rest is pure applied computer science?  That's right, there is no time for jokes.  The food industry has long been not averse to the services of programmers, but is actively using them.  No, they do not work for food. <br>  Large companies and even corporations that own fast food restaurants and not so much nutrition have long been engaged in the development and testing of different tastes in search of the cherished <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bliss_point_(food)">bliss point</a> - they are looking for the most harmonious level of salt, sugar and other flavor components. <br><br>  The point of bliss is the range in which the amount of salt, sugar and fat is pleasant to the consumer.  The task of companies is to save money by identifying and using the least amount of products in this very range.  And all because the business on the taste buds - a bonanza. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c43/425/336/c434253362717ee194d1943d3a1fd94c.png"><br>  <a href="http://theconversation.com/recipe-for-disaster-creating-a-food-supply-to-suit-the-appetite-3218"><i>A source</i></a> <br><br>  That‚Äôs how cognitive cooking is done, friends.  We are only afraid that this is not good for us: corporations consider an effective way to ‚Äúplant‚Äù us, a bright blue screen causes a feeling of hunger (and you can eat a refrigerator on nerves because of a blue BSOD), before a PC, snacks, pizza and burgers come to bang.  In general, there is no way out? <br><br>  There is.  Cook by yourself.  And even if it's a new year, and even Friday, we suggest you use your tastes, engineering thinking, iron logic and offer a burger recipe. <br><br>  The point is this.  Moscow Burger Heroes are long-time friends and partners of RUVDS, with whom we have already held several <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BRWKI6cgjf1/%3Ftaken-by%3Dburgerheroes">events</a> .  They love to create and experiment in the kitchen, but for sure, logical and restrained.  This is not for you every 55 cheeseburgers each, cooked by yesterday‚Äôs philologists and historians.  And they need help - offer in the comments your burgers with or without chickpeas, with meat or fish, or maybe with chicken or turkey.  You can even play with color.  In general, those that you would like to eat right now, hating us for the article in the middle of the day. <br><br>  The most original and realistic burger with a slight modification will fall into the menu, and the winners will get far from edible, but good and material prizes.  We will play the phone <b>Huawei P10 Lite</b> , for the most original recipe, which gained the greatest number of advantages from Habr's users. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/222/58b/249/22258b249ff5f29c1781fbe2485ed8ee.jpg" alt="image"></div><br>  And for the most realistic recipe chosen by our friends from Burger Heroes, the winner will receive a virtual server for 6 months from RUVDS with a CPU configuration of 3 * 3.4 GHz, RAM 3 GB, SSD 60 GB.  All contestants will also receive edible prizes - free coupons for tasting the burger at Burger Heroes in February. <br><br>  Let's fantasize? <br><br>  <i>While the post was published, the first version from our team arrived</i> .  White bread, fried chicken, sauce based on walnuts, seasoning and broth, mustard sauce, raw onions, soft hot peppers, grilled bell peppers, cream cheese.  On the drink - mulled wine or grog of white wine.  Can be served with chicken broth.  Well, it is out of competition. <br><br>  So what will it be, admin-burger? <br><br>  <b>PS</b> For RUVDS, this experiment is not the first collaboration with representatives of the food industry.  Last year, the company introduced the Dark Admin beer, and in the next couple of weeks, Smart Admin will see the light of its antagonist. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/344746/">https://habr.com/ru/post/344746/</a></p>
