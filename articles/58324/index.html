  <section class="page js-page"><h1>On the handles of IT-nick say a word</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Once, when the monitors were large and non-liquid crystal, when talking about the dangers of working with a computer, they mentioned visual hazards.  Indeed, the sensation of sand poured into the eyes is familiar to those who looked at the glass screens of these monstrous monsters.  Monitors became smaller, my eyes began to get tired, too, much less (I personally completely stopped), and the years I spent with the mouse in my hand began to make themselves felt quite differently. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  On Habr√©, the topic of tunnel-carpal syndrome more than once rose, but I decided to return to it again.  And I really hope that the honorable audience of this IT community will support me. <br><br>  At one time, I had the opportunity to study very carefully the problems of combating carpal tunnel syndrome.  First, about 2.5 years ago, I myself, with horror, saw a hand swelling in the evening and the inability to literally move my fingers.  In addition, a year and a half ago, Peter published my book Computer and Health (as far as I know, unique in the market).  And in this book, I paid important attention to this disease of computer scientists.

      However, now I have to return to this problem.  I understand that the gel pad pad bought 2.5 years ago then stopped the development of the problem.  As well as properly selected chair and table, as well as the correct placement of the keyboard on the desktop.  However, I notice that the situation is aggravated, the arm hurts and so on.  This is especially noticeable on Friday evening, after a hard work week.  And after a long weekend the hand gets better.  But then after a heavy bag or barbell in the gym - on the contrary, the pain intensifies. <br><br>  We all know that exercise is the best method.  However, although I consider myself an organized person, I forget to do them, they do not fit into my schedule, etc.  Medicine will not help us, at least, to me (not to go into long narratives, during my 5-minute visit to the surgeon, I told him 4.5 minutes what printer and scanner he should buy, and he signed the ticket for half a minute he said that I need to go to him. Questions arose after my remark that, say, the arm hurts from a computer mouse ...). <br><br>  Therefore, I decided to share my methods of salvation from this scourge, which are still working and, accordingly, I decided to ask Habrales for what they are doing to save their hands. <br><br>  So, I tested: <br><br>  <b>- salt baths</b> <br><br>  Almost every evening I do hot water baths, where I throw cosmetic bath salts.  It is written on the pack that there is salt for the hands, but I think that this is not the point.  It's hard to say about the effect, it seems to me that it works. <br><br>  <b>- ointment Apizartron</b> <br><br>  An old sports tool that I used in my youth to treat sports injuries.  It also seems to me that it works <br><br>  <b>- gel with live bones (am I right?)</b> <br><br>  I see no effect.  Although I heard somewhere that he will, but you need a very long time to smear <br>  <b>- homemade spirit tincture of the plant called ‚ÄúGolden mustache‚Äù</b> <br><br>  In my opinion, it was she who saved my hands for the first year and a half after the start of problems. <br>  <b>- Bishofit</b> <br><br>  This is a salt solution, in Ukraine it is sold at UAH 5 (less than a dollar) per can.  This miracle of nature was advised to me, judging by the description, it helps in problems with the joints, but for everything you need a system, but I have not experienced it systematically. <br><br>  Plans: try <b>Sabelnik's ointment, paraffin therapy</b> . <br><br>  Problems that have not yet been solved are heavy bags (although I almost learned to carry them in my left hand) and a bar in the hall. <br><br>  And what methods have you experienced?  Except exercise. <br><br>  (still I would venture to give a link to my blog, more precisely, its <a href="http://internetessa.com/category/zdorove/">section</a> , in which I quoted the very above-mentioned book) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/58324/">https://habr.com/ru/post/58324/</a></p>
