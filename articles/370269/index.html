  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Westone W80: eight components of good sound</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> At the end of 2016, the Westone company pleased the audience with <a href="http://westonerussia.ru/%3Fp%3D1130">W80</a> headphones.  The manufacturer does not stint on the assurances of the quality and uniqueness of the new product by integrating several decades of experience into a small plastic case.  No doubt - Westone makes good and high-quality headphones, this has been proven more than once or twice.  But is there a limit to perfection?  I propose to get acquainted with the flagship closer. <br> <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/hfhe/blog/286942/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2e7/0dc/743/2e70dc743264a0c765cc79ca3776ed94.jpg"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a>  A box of thick cardboard is strict and beautiful: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/abb/673/a83/abb673a8367e4ab53e781b3407d21e7a.jpg"><br>  Under the two black covers, the inner box made of orange cardboard looks out over the wishes and autograph of designer Karl Cartwright (Karl Cartwright): <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/166/91d/b8c/16691db8c61509f74f96f09a7a6887eb.jpg"><br>  Inside it is a foam insert, giving the package strength.  All useful content is packaged in a small hard zippered case: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2cf/50b/a59/2cf50ba595055cd9215623f7f639126f.jpg"><br>  Its dimensions are small (210 x 140 x 70 mm), the quality of performance is good. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/dce/bbf/4b4/dcebbf4b42708497c7aea63792dc5e2d.jpg"><br>  Inside there are several compartments for storing the headphones, wires, attachments and care products themselves:

These are three pairs of removable decorative parts on the W80 case, a tool for replacement and cleaning, ten pairs of soft nozzles of various shapes, sizes and materials.  Half is made of Comply high viscosity memory foam (True-Fit), and the rest is made of silicone (see the first photo). <br><br>  Someone like this variety may seem redundant, but do not make premature judgments.  As practice has shown, pick up the tips should be not only the size of the ear canal, but also the desired shade of sound. <br><br>  For carrying in a pocket inside a large case is another, smaller, with a mesh bag for the wire.  In any case, it was stored there at the time of unpacking. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/423/314/a98/423314a98a24d9a85c428568709acc38.jpg"><br>  Nothing prevents you from shuffling the contents to your liking. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1bc/cb4/a29/1bccb4a29ea08ecd7a87d5bb8117e58b.jpg"><br><br>  The W80 comes with two cords - one so-called ALO Audio Reference 8, braided with translucent rigid insulation and a three-prong (TRS) 3.5 mm jack for connection to an audio source: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d24/962/b79/d24962b790ee684decaef342ce944640.jpg"><br><br>  The conductors in it are made of highly refined silver plated copper, which should have a positive effect on the sound quality. <br><br>  The second is the usual black, with a four-pin (TRRS) 3.5-mm jack.  The fourth contact is needed for the operation of the buttons on the remote and the microphone when connected to a smartphone.  Nothing remarkable, he does not stand out, the quality of performance is ‚Äúordinary‚Äù, without frills. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/fdc/551/a59/fdc551a595af90c682ba08b9b65861e5.jpg"><br><br>  Connecting the cable to the radiators is carried out with branded small-sized connectors: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c0b/6fa/08f/c0b6fa08ff7aa6bbbf62ea66565ed9aa.jpg"><br><br>  Due to the well-thought-out design, they perfectly hold in the socket and at the same time allow you to quickly replace the cable if necessary.  Given the frequent damage to the cord in wired headphones in the field, as well as the considerable price of the <a href="http://w80/">W80</a> themselves, such care of the user is more than appropriate. <br><br>  Headphones and cables easily fit into one case: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/756/f6d/841/756f6d8414b65e81c0021b7c68724e01.jpg"><br><br>  By the way, covers, like cable, have their own names: Premium Small and Premium Deluxe.  The first, judging by the size, is intended only for the headphones themselves, and the second for the joint transfer of the entire portable audio system: a player, amplifier, headphones, and a hiking set to care for them. <br><br>  W80 - channel reinforcement earphones with eight (!) Drivers.  With the help of the crossover, tasks are distributed between the emitters: two work out low frequencies, two - medium and four are responsible for reproducing high frequencies. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b78/2ba/6de/b782ba6de81556040609c99d8095cf33.jpg"><br><br>  Also, the manufacturer claims a noise reduction system that can reduce their level by 35 dB.  I didn‚Äôt make measurements on noise reduction, but in public transport extraneous sounds are extinguished noticeably better than ordinary headphones - ‚Äúplugs‚Äù of the average price range.  A good role in this is played by the correct selection of nozzles for the ear canal - in the case of the W80, they are very soft and elastic.  This allows you to securely fix the headphones in the ear and to ensure a snug fit of the nozzle to the skin of the passage, sealing the connection. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/26b/0a7/72a/26b0a772af82c427d215ca308ab2063f.jpg"><br><br>  W80 sound good and always different.  Much depends on the sound source and the ‚Äúseals‚Äù used.  So, in a relaxed atmosphere with a proper selection of music with an abundance of detailed instruments, you can catch the difference between the silicone nozzles of different diameters, and the foam material due to its elasticity makes the sound a little deaf.  On the move, these nuances, of course, are not noticeable, and only one thing is important - how tightly the headphones are in contact with the ear canal and whether the tightness will be affected by a sharp turn of the head.  With this complete order when using the complete "audiophile" cable, equipped with reinforcing pieces of a transparent tube at each of the plugs.  It helps to lay the cord behind the ear and fix the W80 in the aisle. <br><br>  Regarding the quality of playback.  The sound is detailed and clear, accents in instrumental compositions are well given, aggressive music (rock, industrial, alternative) is excellent.  The bass is deep, but not always - it is important to choose the right signal source.  With Astell &amp; Kern AK70, there was a shortage of low frequencies, with FiiO X3 II this was not observed (especially after a slight equalizer correction). <br><br>  Summarizing all the above, the W80 model can be answered purely positive: a comprehensively developed product with a rich and well thought-out bundle.  Every detail, be it a carrying case or a cloth case, is convenient to use.  Very appropriate ALO Audio Reference 8;  It is not only good electrical parameters, but also practical.  The only disadvantage of headphones is the price, but it is unlikely to scare away real connoisseurs of quality. <br><br><blockquote><h3>  Specifications <a href="http://westonerussia.ru/%3Fp%3D1130">Westone W80</a> </h3><br>  <b>Headphone Type:</b> Reinforcement <br>  <b>Drivers per channel:</b> 8 <br>  <b>Type of ear cushions:</b> plug-in (monitor) <br>  <b>Frequency range:</b> 5 - 22.000 Hz <br>  <b>1 kHz</b> impedance <b>:</b> 5 ohm <br>  <b>Sensitivity:</b> 111 dB / mW <br>  <b>Passive noise reduction:</b> up to 35 dB <br>  <b>Cables:</b> Removable ALO Audio and MFI <br>  <b>Cable length:</b> 128 cm </blockquote><br>  We also bring to your attention a <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/hfhe/blog/279932/">review of</a> more affordable <a href="http://westonerussia.ru/%3Fcat%3D15">Westone AM</a> headphones (all three models - AM10, AM20 and AM30) that started our blog: <br><br> <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/hfhe/blog/279932/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/085/f9b/811/085f9b811b69fd4eb7c393f8961d0b1c.jpg"></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/370269/">https://habr.com/ru/post/370269/</a></p>
