Today we go further and introduce collective editing of questions.  Now each member of the community can make changes to the questions of any other participant.  You can edit everything: the essence of the question, its details, as well as the tags to which the question is attached. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a81/dae/fb3/a81daefb30604d118cd3cfddf130f961.png"><br><br>  A new opportunity opens up the following stunning prospects. <br><a name="habracut"></a>

    <h2>  Improving the accuracy and speed of delivery of questions </h2><br>  For the service of questions and answers, it is very important to be able to deliver the questions exactly to those people who are not interested in this topic and can help with the answer.  Delivery is realized by linking the question to the correct tags.  Users who subscribe to question tags receive it in their feed, as well as to their email, through an <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/tm/blog/245279/">enhanced subscription</a> to tags or via a <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/tm/blog/225889/">weekly digest</a> . <br><br>  Often, users, especially beginners, carelessly affix their question tags: either they prescribe extras, or vice versa - they don‚Äôt add necessary ones.  As a result, the tape may be cluttered with irrelevant questions for one tag, and vice versa for other tags - not filled with relevant questions. <br><br>  Now the situation can be significantly improved.  Everyone can go into any question and correct those tags to which he was attached by the author. <br><br><h2>  Clarification of the meaning of questions </h2><br>  Often the questions are asked by those who are not very strong in this matter, or by those who find it difficult to give a written statement of their thoughts.  And because the wording of the questions are incomprehensible, confusing, and sometimes simply wrong.  To such questions react reluctantly, and sometimes simply hostile.  But sometimes it is enough just to slightly correct the wording and rearrange the accents, and the question from ‚Äústupid‚Äù becomes very ‚Äúsmart‚Äù and interesting. <br><br>  Now those who own the topic and are able to clearly express their thoughts will be able to help those who have not mastered these skills yet, to convey their thoughts to the experts.  It is enough to make changes to the essence (title) or details (description) of the question. <br><br><h2>  Creating a comfortable knowledge sharing environment </h2><br>  Those who constantly follow the questions in their specialty, have to look through a lot of texts.  And a lot of grammatical and syntactic errors in these texts are irritating, through which one has to wade in order to understand what is being asked of you.  This greatly reduces people's productivity, with the result that far fewer good answers appear. <br><br>  From now on, those who are friends with the Russian language will be able to act as text editors.  And thus not only to help experts quickly grasp the essence of the issue, but also to help the authors of illiterate texts master the power of the Russian language. <br><br><h2>  How does collective editing of questions </h2><br>  In order for the proposed edit to take effect, the author of the question or moderator must accept it.  All adopted edits are saved on the page of the history of changes in the question: here you can see who proposed which revisions.  A little later, we will definitely reward those who are actively involved in improving the quality of issues on the "Toaster". <br><br>  To suggest editing the question, you need to click on the ellipsis icon and in the drop-down menu, click on the "Correct the issue" link. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ddf/f58/30a/ddff5830ada7474281c58de4fb14b5ff.png"><br><br>  After that you get on the form of creating a new version of the question.  This form is no different from the usual form of the question.  It is immediately filled with the data of the current version. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/db0/a03/196/db0a0319677949bebfa0ab3d04345bcb.png"><br><br>  After you save your version, you go to a page with a history of changing the issue and see your version, which shows the edits that you made. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2c4/ade/478/2c4ade478dc24999a7bb26a9962e5fb4.png"><br><br>  The author of the question is immediately notified that such a user offers an edit.  He follows the link leading directly to the new version, where he also sees all the changes made.  Here he has two buttons: "Accept" and "Reject."  If he accepts the proposed version, then it becomes relevant, and the author of the edit is sent a notification that his edit has been accepted.  The next time you open the context menu of the question, you can see that there is already a history of changes (the number of accepted edits is shown in parentheses). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/85c/39d/b0b/85c39db0b0344ac3826bd8e4ebf29ac3.png"><br><br>  Let's make the ‚ÄúToaster‚Äù the best place to quickly provide qualified answers to any questions on IT topics!  And so help us collective editing of questions. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/250391/">https://habr.com/ru/post/250391/</a></p>
