  <section class="page js-page"><h1>As a star of Brazilian TV shows, she accidentally helped open an IT company in Russia</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  On September 1, 2008, exactly nine years ago, ITSumma had its first office in Irkutsk.  We consider this day to be one of the three birthdays of the company - there is another day of official registration of legal entity and the day when the star of soap operas came to a talk show in Brazil's prime time and told about makemebabies.com, which was immediately followed by a powerful stream of visitors and who therefore became one of our first customers.  Two photos could be uploaded to the site, they were mixed, and a picture of a child would be produced that would have turned out to be the people in the photo. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/e03/010/52b/e0301052bfec4a8a9e7f0332b7f47ee7.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In our blog, we write about technologies, our developments, interesting thoughts, but today I would like to speculate about why success is almost always an accident.  Including the emergence of ITSumma is a chance coincidence.  Under the cut - my thoughts on this and the history of the creation of the company. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  At one of the conferences where businessmen told about their success stories, I noticed one interesting point - almost all of them told that the business was an accident.  This is quite interesting - no one says that he consciously went to make this or that business.  I wondered if chance was always the main factor of success, or did this specific character of the personality lead to the fact that in the end they were ‚Äúlucky‚Äù?  Is it possible for a person to learn to think and behave himself so that such ‚Äúaccidents‚Äù occur?

      In 2008, my friend, who at that time lived in St. Petersburg, was developing software that recognizes faces.  Together with their partners from Israel, they launched the site <a href="http://makemebabies.com/">makemebabies.com</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/6a3/0cb/00a/6a30cb00aa0e470e87e0f7245e449efb.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <a href="http://mashable.com/2008/06/24/makemebabies/">An article about a Mashable site</a> read a Brazilian TV series star, uploaded photos, and absolutely by chance she had a child, one on one looking like their little son.  She came with this photo for an evening talk show in Brazil.  Within a few hours, three million people visited the site, and the site fell.  At that time I was engaged in system administration on freelancing, friends called me and asked for help.  For almost two days I did not sleep, trying not to let the site fall.  And then the guys asked to keep the site constantly and help them develop a new one so that they would not fall down.  So our company appeared. <br><br>  Then these friends from Israel came to us to Irkutsk, and we all joked: to think only, the producer of that Brazilian TV show still does not know how many lives he has changed without himself assuming.  One of them is now engaged in the manufacture of guitars, and its new model is more expected than the new Fender models in 2017.  He began to make guitars with the money he earned from that joint venture, which received random success. <br><br>  The first "big" client ITSumma came to us, too, one might say, by chance - a lightning bolt hit the data center where it was serviced.  Today we are nine years old, and I still do not understand how we managed to go this way to a successful business. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/18b/9ae/9d2/18b9ae9d2a45431c92cab79d1b10e042.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Now ITSumma employs 60 people, we have offices in Irkutsk, Moscow and St. Petersburg and we are trying to open an office in the USA</i> <br><br>  Somehow, even more rational people than I explained to me - the point is that I just don‚Äôt notice the ‚Äúunsuccessful‚Äù events, they are simply considered a normal life, and when something ‚Äúspecial‚Äù happens, you pay attention to it.  That ‚Äúluck‚Äù depends on the number of unsuccessful attempts that you have made before. <br><br>  And here I understood one of the most important decisions for myself.  When something fails the first, second or third time, this does not mean a complete failure;  it only means what might happen next time.  Many successful entrepreneurs have a history of failures - it very rarely happens that someone is lucky from the very beginning.  The founder of the Finnish studio Rovio Peter Westerback with friends made dozens of unsuccessful games, and only with Angry birds became famous all over the world, earning millions of dollars.  Few people know that before founding Microsoft, Bill Gates and Paul Allen, while studying in high school, had already tried to create a company, developing devices for the number of passing cars in their native Seattle.  The device did not work, but it was joint work experience, software development that enabled Gates and Allen to create Microsoft three years later.  Failures happened to Mark Zuckerberg, Sergey Brin, and many others. <br><br>  It is necessary to stop treating failures as a problem, and think like this: ‚ÄúNow we are not lucky, but this brings me closer to success.‚Äù  And then be sure to get lucky.  That is, success can only be achieved if you constantly do something, and if you continue to move forward, sooner or later, ‚Äúgood luck‚Äù will come.  If you stop after the first attempt - yes, almost certainly no miracle will happen.  But if you made, say, one hundred attempts, then with one of these attempts something will definitely work out. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/336938/">https://habr.com/ru/post/336938/</a></p>
