Last year, it was officially surpassed by the world day of shopping, it is also the day of the bachelors in China, it is 11.11.  The turnover of the biggest Chinese sale was 9 times higher than Black Friday. <br><br> <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/gearbest/blog/282298/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3af/fcd/d16/3affcdd164274adff9ecbd0631d08c4d.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  The scale of sales in Chinese (and not only) retail is so huge that a comic idiom appeared in China, which can be translated as ‚Äúcutting off your hand‚Äù.  Naturally, the one that lies on the mouse or fluently controls the touchpad - because the passion for online shopping in the Middle Kingdom has passed all boundaries and turned into madness.  Which, by the way, for several years now, Europeans and Russians are no less reeling.  And all because of mass reasons.  Gearbest, like a geek's Chinese shop, did not stand aside - this time we approached 11.11 as never fully armed. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  First and foremost, all activities are collected on a separate <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/m-promotion-active-252.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">page</a> with cute gifs.

    <h3>  Remember last year's snow </h3><br>  Gearbest is actively growing in the international market - literally, all the flags to visit us.  And we decided to talk about one of the most protected commercial secrets of stores - the most popular products last year's sales.  We present to your attention the alignment of countries and products - purely for curiosity. <br><br><ul><li>  In Russia, the most popular product was the <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/smart-wristband/pp_263275.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">Xiaomi Mi Band</a> with white LEDs. <br></li><li>  In Ukraine, the multitul in the form of a <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/survival-emergency-gear/pp_16234.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">Multi-function Outdoor Knife Saber Card</a> was a sales hit. <br></li><li>  European countries (France, Germany, Italy) unanimously chose the <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/smart-wristband/pp_263275.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">Original Xiaomi Mi Band 1S</a> . <br></li><li>  In the US, everyone took the <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/home-gadgets/pp_13613.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">Creative Skull Design Crystal Transparent Glass Cup</a> . <br></li></ul><br>  Most popular products in categories: <br><br><ul><li>  The top-selling phones were the <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/cell-phones/pp_202943.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">DOOGEE Y100X</a> , the <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/cell-phones/pp_328502.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">XIAOMI RedMi Note 2 32GB</a> and the <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/cell-phones/pp_188622.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">DOOGEE Y100 Pro</a> . <br></li><li>  The tablet that everyone wanted was the Teclast X98 Air 3G Phablet 64GB ROM, and the slightly less wanted Teclast X98 Air III Tablet PC. <br></li><li>  The Floureon H101 was the quadcopter for each and every one, followed by the DM007 RC Quadcopter 6 Axis Gyro Explorer UFO and Yizhan Tarantula X6. <br></li></ul><br>  By the number of sales and the number of orders by language, the first three are as follows: English, Russian, Spanish. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/937/42e/45d/93742e45dd6f06e01acab646827df621.png"><br><br>  But in general, the first five looks like this: the United States, Russia, Germany, Spain, France and Italy. <br><br><h3>  Cutting coupons </h3><br>  Everyone loves coupons, is looking for and actively using them - what could be nicer than a good discount, received just like that.  At Gearbest every day you can get different types of coupons: for a product, for a product category, for a section, for a brand, etc.  For example, you can get a 30% discount coupon for clothes.  More details can be found on <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/coupon.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">the coupons page.</a> <br><br>  Coupons will be issued at a strictly designated time.  So beware!  And yes, of course, their number is limited.  At the same time, for each IP, only one coupon of each type will be available every day - you need to have time to choose. <br><br>  If you are too lazy or have no time to sit on the Gearbest website and continuously update pages with promotional items, subscribe to a special newsletter about 11.11 (on the main page of the promotion). <br><br>  ‚ÄúCountdown‚Äù starts 11.11.  And here there are two important time points: <br><br><ul><li>  The time when it will be possible to get the biggest discounts on coupons: November 7 - November 15, 00:00 Beijing time (19:00 Moscow time); </li><li>  All coupons will be valid only after November 9, 11:00 Moscow time. </li></ul><br><h3>  Podarkopad </h3><br>  In general, the leaf fall is over, the snowfall continues to cover Russia with might and main, why not call the <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/m-promotion-active-253.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">action Giftopad</a> ?  The essence is simple, just like in the Winnie the Pooh cartoon: get gifts for free, that is, for nothing.  What to do to get a gift?  It is enough to stand under <s>an umbrella and look at the sky with a</s> special rain in our system.  First, you must be registered on <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">www.gearbest.com</a> .  Secondly, you must be quick to catch as many coins as possible to get points, coupons and free gifts! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/eed/b1b/9e9/eedb1b9e9dcd4e58a37e89e804f69da3.jpg"><br><br>  What should be done to get under this rain: <br><br><ol><li>  Log in and share on one of the channels <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/m-promotion-active-253.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">page shares</a> .  It's simple - click the VK or FB or Instagram button on the stock.  Schering as schering, nothing new. <br></li><li>  Catch coins from November 7 to 15 at a certain time!  Here is the schedule of rain: at 19:00, 21:00, 24:00, 13:00 and 16:00 (Moscow time).  It's all like in Mario. <br></li><li>  The gift will last 3 minutes in each segment of the allotted time.  That is, from 16-00 to 16-03.  Have time to catch as many coins as possible!  Three minutes of the game after all, do not distract you much?  A break at work or at home does not hurt. <br></li><li>  What are the gifts?  Coins, points and goods will be hidden behind the coins.  By the way, pay special attention to the goods - they are all available for purchase with discounts. <br></li></ol><br>  Ultrabook <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/tablet-pcs/pp_349484.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">Cube iWork11</a> .

The functional fitness tracker from Teclast looks very good and can do a lot: count the steps, remotely control the camera of the phone, send notifications to WhatsApp, Facebook, SMS and calls, follow your sleep.  By the way, if you don‚Äôt get it among the gifts, it‚Äôs very cheap now - $ 12.55. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/df2/c7d/298/df2c7d29825ff40b9bf73c2181a8ef29.jpg" width="550"></div><br>  TV box <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/tv-box-mini-pc/pp_447781.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">YUNDOO Y2</a> .
