But do people free up their time on themselves, or use it to become even more busy? <br><br>  Here, for example, that the president of Microsoft in Russia advises to combat the lack of time: <br><br><ul><li>  Plan your schedule in such a way as to solve as few secondary urgent tasks as possible, and important ones - to solve before they become urgent; </li><li>  Do what you love with maximum engagement; </li><li>  Consider the principle of life balance as an important personal and managerial task. </li></ul><br>  Yes, we can not pause the world.  But we can change the approach to business and attitude towards our own lives.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/dad/b9e/f80/dadb9ef809345968e6e0ca6f61f6e949.jpg"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Steve Jobs, in his famous speech to Stanford graduates, spoke about his own way to always be satisfied with life: <br><blockquote>  Every morning I look in the mirror and ask myself: ‚ÄúIf today was the last day of my life, would I want to do what I‚Äôm going to do?‚Äù.  And whenever I say ‚ÄúNo‚Äù to myself for too many days in a row, I understand that something needs to be changed. </blockquote><br>  What are we aiming for?  To success, to money, fortunately?  Do these concepts always coincide? <br><br><h4>  Successful does not mean happy </h4><br>  Not always achieving financial stability and success in business makes a person happy.  Money alone does not bring happiness.  But when there is little or no money, they play the role of a substitute for happiness. <br><br>  It is believed that there is a certain trait, after which money ceases to be the equivalent of happiness.  American researchers claim that this happens after a person‚Äôs income exceeds $ 70,000 per year.  We have this figure should be 2-3 times less. <br><br>  This statement is confirmed by words from an interview with the famous actor Bruce Willis: <br><blockquote>  Before I began to take acting classes, I was completely satisfied with my job as a bartender.  I earned good money by the standards of proletarian New Jersey, and I felt that the whole world was at my feet.  Even when I began to act in blockbusters and earn millions, I did not feel happier or happier with life than in those years.  Funny, yes? </blockquote><br>  The fact that the star of Hollywood seems "fun" for the majority remains an unattainable dream.  People believe that they should work hard and hard to achieve the desired heights.  It's hard to argue with that.  But often hard work from a means to achieve the goal itself turns into a goal.  A person becomes a workaholic. <br><br><h4>  About workaholics </h4><br>  Our time is considered the ‚Äúera of consumption‚Äù, in which financial success plays a big role.  A person at a subconscious level builds a logical chain: <br><br>  I want to live comfortably ‚Üí you should pay for comfort ‚Üí you have to work a lot to have money. <br><br>  As a result of the implementation of these rules, a person becomes a workaholic. <br><br>  Jason Fried and David Heinemeyer Hansson have written well about the dangers of workaholism in their book ‚ÄúRework‚Äù: <br><blockquote>  Our culture encourages the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãworkaholics.  Every now and then we hear about people working at night.  They, in turn, encourage ‚Äúnight vigil‚Äù and sleep in the office.  It is believed that you need to award the medal "For Courage" to those who kill themselves on the project.  No amount of work is too big. <br>  Such workaholism is not only not mandatory, it is stupid.  Working no longer means worrying more about business success or doing more.  It only means that you work more. <br><br>  As a result, workaholics create more problems than they solve.  First, this style of work can not be stable for a long time.  And when a person ‚Äúburns out‚Äù, and this will happen, the consequences will be very serious. <br><br>  Workaholics are not heroes.  They do not save time, they just burn it.  This hero has long been at home, he found a faster way to complete his work. </blockquote><br>  I completely agree with this, work really needs not too much.  In order to do more, you need to work efficiently, and not to put yourself in a state of constant fatigue.  Try to take a pause regularly, let's relax your body.  Work in order to live, and not vice versa. <br><br><h4>  About a dream </h4><br>  The best rest is not a change of activity at all.  The best (and necessary) rest is a dream. <br><br>  Working to the detriment of sleep is not correct.  Try to sleep for 7-8 hours a day, adhering to a constant schedule.  Do not miss the opportunity to sleep at lunchtime for 20-30 minutes. <br><br>  You can only occasionally allow yourself to work day and night.  Regular lack of sleep will cause a number of problems (from the aforementioned book ‚ÄúRework‚Äù): <br><br><ul><li>  Loss of ingenuity.  People who achieve a result many times more effective than the majority are distinguished from this majority not by greater diligence, but by ingenuity, which allows them to find a solution that requires one tenth of the effort compared to the others.  When you do not sleep, you lose such an important advantage as ingenuity; </li><li>  Lack of drive.  You will be doing what is really not important, for example, reading another non-meaningful article.  When tired, you lack the motivation to do big things; </li><li>  Aggression.  Feeling tired, you cease to be patient and tolerant.  The likelihood that others will become victims of your insomnia increases; </li><li>  Bad decisions.  It is bad decisions you are destined to take in a state of fatigue; </li><li>  Stubbornness: in a state of fatigue, it always seems easier for a person to continue to work in the chosen direction, no matter how bad it is, instead of revising its correctness.  The finish line seems like a constant mirage, and everything ends up going too far into the desert. </li></ul><br>  What practical steps should be taken to optimize your time and switch to a less stressful mode of operation? <br><br><h4>  About goals </h4><br>  Any action will be much more effective if you break it into goals, tasks.  Tasks are the same goals, only on a smaller scale. <br><br>  If the goal is not recorded, then it does not exist.  You can write it anywhere: in the diary, on a sticker, on a piece of paper.  Many people prefer to use special services, for example, the <a href="https://smartprogress.do/">service of achieving the goals of Smartprogress</a> .  This is one of the best Russian-language services, which allows you to record goals, dividing them into stages. <br><br>  By registering on the site, you formulate your goal, break it into stages, and keep a kind of diary, commenting on the progress of each stage and the progress towards the final goal.  The service also allows you to discuss your own and other people's goals with other users, consult, comment, etc.  The result of all this is a visual representation of the progress in the process of accomplishing its goal.  Some consider these services to be something of a narrowly focused social network, and doubt their usefulness.  But for many, such a public statement of their goals really helps in achieving them.  Among the English-speaking public, <a href="http://www.43things.com/">43things.com is a</a> very popular service. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/cdc/30b/0f0/cdc30b0f0851d46aa84f3e48a495631f.jpg" align="left"><br><h4>  About time management </h4><br><br>  The fulfillment of our duties does not always cause us spiritual enthusiasm and enthusiasm.  Instead of working, we read articles that are supposedly useful to us, we put things in order on the desktop, etc.  In other words, we do anything to delay the start of work on an uninteresting or routine task. <br><br>  The most effective way to solve the above problem is the correct distribution of working time, time management. <br><br>  A large number of books, articles and manuals have been written on how to organize time.  You can easily find a lot of materials on the topic, for example, on the website <a href="http://improvement.ru/">improvement.ru</a> , on thematic forums and in blogs. <br><br>  Getting acquainted with the methods of proper organization of working time, do not forget about the main thing: <br>  Time management for you is not a theoretical discipline, but an applied method. <br><br>  If instead of working you will only study the methods of its organization, this is unlikely to contribute to success. <br>  We are all different, so maybe the individual way will be better than recommended in any new book?  All this you do to make it more convenient. <br><br><h4>  Total </h4><br>  In order for life and work to turn from a race and stress into an enjoyable, calm process, it is necessary not so much: <br><br><ul><li>  Clear formulation of strategic objectives and tactical objectives; </li><li>  The correct distribution of working time; </li><li>  Full rest and sleep. </li></ul><br>  Indeed, a little, and even something similar to the advice of Captain Obvious.  But how many of us follow these simple rules? <br><br>  Do you always remember that your most important project is yourself? <br><br>  <i>PS If you do not have an account in Habr√©, you can express your opinion on <a href="http://smarttalks.club/ru/rhythm-life/">this article in our blog - SmartTalks</a></i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/167489/">https://habr.com/ru/post/167489/</a></p>
