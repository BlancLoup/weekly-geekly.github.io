      The answer to the question of choosing between a local and a cloud server is obvious. <br>  Of course, it is always better to have both a local and a cloud server in order to ensure maximum continuity of business processes in the enterprise and continuous backup of important data.  However, the budget for IT that is not always allocated allows one to pull both options.  That is why the manager, who is responsible for the IT infrastructure at the enterprise, has to choose one thing.  And now we will try to analyze as much as possible the pros and cons, as well as the possible risks of using virtual and physical servers for Zimbra deployment in the enterprise. <br><br>  Deciding on the choice of site for the Zimbra Collaboration Suite should be based on the size of the company and the type of activity in which it is engaged.  For example, Zimbra is very popular among small-scale enterprises and startups with low turnover, because it is a free open-source solution.  Zimbra Collaboration Suite allows such enterprises to organize joint work, involve employees working on the remote, and in some cases even abandon their own office. <br><br>  It is usually believed that for small businesses the best option is a local server, because Zimbra is completely undemanding in computing power and an inconspicuous system unit installed with Ubuntu on board will be much cheaper than renting a cloud server.  However, this is not always the case, and primarily depends on the criticality of using Zimbra in your business processes, as well as on what other IT solutions are used in the enterprise.  Deploying Zimbra on a local server in the future may result in a number of problems for an enterprise that is tied up to work together.  As the company grows and develops, the question of the continuity of Zimbra operation, systematic backup of data, and equipment upgrades will be increasingly critical.  All these issues are much more efficiently solved when using a cloud server. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b32/7b4/64d/b327b464db2c4a3f13925bf111bdc0aa.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In addition to economy, the cloud server helps to provide higher mobility for the enterprise, compared to the local server.  It is no secret that speed and mobility is the advantage of small businesses over large businesses and the lack of a physical server greatly simplifies moving to a new office.  This saves a lot of time and increases the reliability of the IT infrastructure, because virtual servers, unlike physical ones, are extremely rarely broken and the consequences of such failures are usually not as serious as in the case of physical servers. <br><br>  In the case of medium-sized businesses, the cloud infrastructure is much cheaper than the local one.  It's not just about capital costs and cost of ownership, but also about security issues.  Since Zimbra is not just a mail server, but also a complete collaboration solution, over time a large amount of data, which is a trade secret, accumulates on the server with Zimbra.  That is why the IT manager is required not only to ensure the continuity of the server, but also data integrity and prevention of important third-party information.  Again, more <br>  Safe in such cases are certified cloud servers, which allow to exclude a number of possibilities for intruders.  For example, if a firing system administrator or IT manager decides to ‚Äúgrab with him‚Äù the Zimbra archive, then in case of using a cloud service, this incident will be recorded by the service provider. <br><br>  But for large enterprises, based on the volume of computing power consumption and IT services, it is much more profitable to maintain their own fleet of servers and their own IT staff.  Typically, such enterprises have a serious security policy that <br>  Significantly reduces the risks associated with maintaining your own IT infrastructure.  Also, the option with local servers is suitable for government agencies that can use Zimbra because of the open source code, but cannot transfer their data to the side. <br><br>  Thus, we have seen that the option with virtual servers for Zimbra deployment is often the most optimal and secure. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/368761/">https://habr.com/ru/post/368761/</a></p>
