Yes.  Let it not always work ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  1. We do not come to meet you on time. <br>  So that you do not have the deceptive impression that I take this meeting at least a little seriously.  It is necessary to torture you! <br><br>  2. We do not kiss with you on the first date. <br>  Although it would seem, what's the difference: the first, second, that fifty-fifth, not in mathematics because of happiness. <br><br>  3. We do not tell about the fact that we have dyed hair, contact lenses, veins on the teeth, or silicone implants in the chest. <br>  And certainly we are not going to discuss these interesting facts with you in detail. <br>  Did you notice?  Have you guessed?  The most correct thing would be if you keep the results of these scientific studies with you.  Professional illusionists, you know, cannot stand it either, when the secrets of their tricks become the property of the general public.

      4. We do not sleep with you on the second date. <br>  It‚Äôs not that I reread fairy tales in my childhood, in which all the most interesting things happen exactly on the third night - they bring Wii there, for example ... But I must, first, make you follow me, and second, how otherwise you will guess that I am a girl with strict moral principles? <br><br>  5. We will not go to your house for the first time, without any reason, even the most trifling. <br>  Think of something, offer to drink a unique, delicious tea varieties "Lipton" in tea bags.  Seduce to offer to read the tutorial playing the bagpipes.  Ask for help moving the refrigerator.  I need excuse for conscience. <br><br>  6. We do not call you earlier than three days after the date. <br>  In theory, you, the animal, of course had to call himself.  That evening!  As a last resort, the next day ... And, in an amicable way, I shouldn‚Äôt have had to desecrate my manicure by dialing your number at all ... Because it is completely unclear why you are not calling. <br><br>  There are three options: <br>  a) you died <br>  b) you didn‚Äôt like me (you‚Äôd rather die) <br>  c) you are shy because you are timid and unsure of yourself. <br>  I will call you in the calculation of the ‚Äúin‚Äù option, but not earlier than 72 hours after our meeting - I will sit over the phone with a stopwatch, but I will not disgrace myself with a premature call. <br><br>  7. We do not say that you have a small penis. <br>  At least, as long as we still hope to continue the relationship.  From our point of view, such recognition is the last frontier; the use of the nuclear button is the last explosion before the end of the world.  As a last resort, we can give you something like, "Well ... it's not very big ... but so wonderful! .." <br><br>  8. We do not admit that we can look at pictures with naked men for hours. <br>  Because in men I am only interested in the soul.  Didn't you know?  I, after all, is not such a primitive organism as some. <br><br>  9. We will never say: ‚ÄúHoney, I will not go with you today, because I did not expect to continue the banquet and put on my favorite little old panties with yellow ducklings.  In addition, epilation in the bikini area now also leaves much to be desired ... ‚Äù. <br>  I'd rather fly you some nonsense about the fact that today I decided to better understand our feelings with you. <br><br>  10. You and I will not have sex in silence. <br>  Do you want the truth?  Twice in my life, I, communicating with a man, actually experienced an irrepressible need to yell, moan and howl.  This man was my dentist.  In all other cases, I could easily and not utter a word, even experiencing ten orgasms in a row, but I need to somehow encourage you!  Well, in general - the more passion sounds in the bedroom, the more reckless sex is, and will you wait for the right sound effects?  All the most have to. <br><br>  11. We do not tolerate when you, taking off our pants, leave them hanging on one leg. <br>  Immediately there is a feeling that you treat me insufficiently reverently.  And you are only interested in one part of my body (although, I know for sure that you are interested in at least three ... no, even four! ..). <br><br>  12. We will not engage in oral sex with you twice. <br>  Unless you are a paralyzed patient, and I am a sister of mercy, in all other cases, mercy does not work, I do not so much aspire to bring good to people. <br><br>  13. We do not allow you to dig in the box with our laundry. <br>  Would you like it if I opened the hood of the car and started to gamble there with a large spanner at random? <br><br>  14. We will not have sex if you watch a porn movie at this moment. <br>  I must excite you at this moment, and not that unpleasant Swedish woman.  You at least pretend to look at me!  And in general, your neck is now collapsed, if you do not immediately stop staring there - well, give me a remote! <br><br>  15. We are very disgusted to ask you for money. <br>  We prefer to have abstract conversations about how the mean government again inflated the prices of model shoes and acrylic nails.  And then - hope for the speed of your intellect. <br><br>  +++ <br>  So here ... Such are the girls in the act;) <br><br>  <a href="http://bla-bla-bla.ru/">Original source</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/7767/">https://habr.com/ru/post/7767/</a></p>
