We are not talking about the need to take out the stale garbage or nail the shelf to the wall, I'm talking about more ambitious things.  For some of you, especially for habre habitues, opening your startup can be such a large-scale task, for others - moving to another country, for the third - searching for a life partner.  Whatever global goal is, its biggest problem is globality.

These questions arise only when you look at the problem from a high level, but if you break it apart, everything becomes logical and accessible.  For many people, breaking down their goals into components can become an overwhelming task, and then other people‚Äôs experience can come to the rescue. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Here it is important to understand that there are few pioneers on Earth.  It was hard for Gagarin, who first experienced outrageous overloads and survived, other astronauts already used his experience, it was hard for primitive man to find himself face to face with a saber-toothed tiger, only then his descendants were able to defend against them with fire and primitive weapons.  In the modern world we live with the benefits and experiences gained by past generations, most of the problems have already been solved by someone else, at the same time your life experience is also unique and you can share it with someone who does not have this experience. <br><br>  After thinking about it once, we decided to create a resource where we can share this experience.  We set out to gather on one site completely different people united by one goal - the realization of their goals and objectives.  What is the essence of the project: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3eb/c14/5b8/3ebc145b8470ba7aad28327fa7900a65.png"><br><h5>  TOOL </h5>  We give you the opportunity to publish your cherished goal for public viewing.  Break the goal into stages.  Having done this, you yourself will understand your further actions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/850/7e6/d8e/8507e6d8e6ce1c6b6d90489441c58636.png"><br><h5>  HELP </h5>  It‚Äôs very difficult to analyze everything at once and understand how to proceed, and we often resort to outside advice. <br>  Each participant has their own experience.  Discussing our goals, and commenting on others, we will inevitably find the right solution. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/83d/6ba/b93/83d6bab938bc37e08c8d0fd5e57151ce.png"><br><h5>  MOTIVATION </h5>  The goal is created, the solution steps are found, what next?  Then it's up to you. <br>  It would be naive to believe that gin will arrive tomorrow and will do all the work.  We will only occasionally remind you of your dream. <br><br>  <a href="https://smartprogress.do/">SmartProgress is</a> not a blog, but something more.  Users can track the current implementation of each goal, plus comments and all stages are tied to one goal.  The result of all this - a visual representation of the progress of the process of achieving the goal.  Blogging in a similar format would be problematic, and not all users are able to start a blog.  We, in turn, tried to simplify registration to the maximum, and also introduced a unique format for testing the site - a ‚Äútoy account‚Äù.  With it you can register on the site in one click and try out the main features of the site - conveniently and quickly. <br>  If the service sympathizes with you and you want to use it all the time, then welcome to the main registration. <br><br>  Now the project is in beta testing.  We will be happy if you leave feedback and comments. <br><br>  <a href="https://smartprogress.do/">SmartProgress</a> .  Progress wisely! <br><br>  <i>PS If you do not have an account in Habr√©, you can express your opinion on <a href="http://smarttalks.club/ru/smartprogress/">this article in our blog - SmartTalks</a></i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/152381/">https://habr.com/ru/post/152381/</a></p>
