  <section class="page js-page"><h1>During the job search</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Greetings habrayuzer. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/25/cf/25cfbc9e72be5658f505d0ebe5539d56.jpg" align="right"><br>  Recently, I happened to look for a new job.  This means that I had to attend quite a lot of interviews, and therefore I would like to share my experience, to express my observations and comments on the whole process of hiring employees.  I hope that in the post they will find something useful and those who are looking for work, and those who are looking for a new employee. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  Contact </h5><br>  In general, a job search begins with viewing and selecting jobs.  I think for a IT person in a hundred percent of cases these are sites like HH.ru.  A few comments on this. <br><br>  From personal experience, I got the impression that it is less effective to leave an application like ‚ÄúRespond to a vacancy‚Äù on such sites than to send a resume directly to an e-mail.  In addition, everyone has a summary in doc or pdf, but on the websites it is still necessary to register.  If the vacancy does not specify a contact address, look at the company's website and look for the same vacancy on other sites.  For example, in My Circle, where vacancies are already placed by specific people, from whom you can always find out the desired mailing address. <br><br>  Each of us, reading the requirements for a job and the specified salary, ‚Äútries on‚Äù everything for himself.  Advice - even if you understand that (some) do not pull on the stated requirements or salary, it is still worth submitting a resume.  <i>‚ÄúAsk for the impossible - you will get the maximum</i> .‚Äù

      Employer: be sure to answer letters.  Even if the candidate did not fit you.  It's not that hard to write two or three lines.  This leaves a more positive impression of the company than the lack of a response.  And the latter can be interpreted as you please: the resume did not reach, or the resume came, but was not considered, or the summary was reviewed, but the candidate did not fit. <br><br><h5>  Job interviews </h5><br>  So, you were invited to an interview.  The first impression from the company is HR.  Personally, I am very sensitive to this person.  In some companies, after communicating with HR, I realized that I don‚Äôt want to continue any further.  For example, it is worth at least say hello to the candidate <i>with a smile</i> .  Seriously.  Also a really good HR will definitely tell about the company, in connection with which a vacancy is open, what conditions are offered, and ask to ask him questions. <br><br>  Next - a technical interview.  As a rule, this is a project manager or one of the leading developers (sometimes - together).  It is good when a company representative again tells about the company itself, about a vacancy, with a more technical bias, and answers your questions at the end of the interview.  At the interview itself, it is necessary to give an opportunity to reflect on the answer if the candidate asks questions in the process of thinking and answers them.  It is impossible to know everything, you can forget something, but to think and come to an answer is valuable.  You can ask leading questions.  And it's better not to confuse with phrases like ‚ÄúWhat-what?  Are you sure? ‚ÄùOr‚Äú I don‚Äôt know :) ‚Äù, interview - and so tense. <br><br>  From a personal one, I don‚Äôt like it when they make it clear during an interview that they are ready to tear you away with your hands.  Well, just not interesting :).  I also consider an incorrect question about the level of wages in the previous place.  If only because this level may be below the level of knowledge due to various circumstances (I know enough examples). <br><br>  At the interview, especially with managers / developers, ask as many questions as possible.  You <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/gtd/113652/">have to work with these people</a> .  The most unexpected for all was the question " <s>What do you dislike</s> ? What would you improve in your company, in your work?". <br><br>  Also, as an additional selection, a candidate may be asked to complete a test task.  As before the interview (entrance control), and after.  What is upsetting - sometimes ‚Äúinput‚Äù test tasks are sent without regard to the vacancy and candidate‚Äôs resume.  To be honest, getting a job for a 3rd year student who settles in to the junior position, the desire to get involved disappears further. <br><br>  Acquaintance with the company begins with HR, and HR ends.  As a result of the interviews, I accepted one of the proposals.  Accordingly, he wrote a waiver to other companies, explaining the reason and thanking him for his time and attention.  And somewhere I was at the stage of performing the test task, somewhere I had ready-made proposals.  And I never thought that the reaction is so different.  From silence in response (again, is it difficult to write a few lines?), To questions about the reasons for the choice, the wishes of professional success and the offer of a larger salary.  What do you think, if later someone asks me, ‚ÄúWhat is there about Company Z?‚Äù, About whom will I give a <i>better opinion</i> ? .. <br><br><h5>  Briefly </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/6d/16/6d16cc222087236109cc094f2f773035.jpg" align="right"><br>  The main idea that I would like to convey to those who are looking for employees - be attentive to people.  Yes, there may be many candidates.  But you and the relevant experts have it.  The opinion about the company remains good, if at all stages the candidate is treated as the <i>only one</i> , and not as someone from the crowd (letters without addressing by name are not uncommon).  To some extent, the company's attitude towards candidates can be extrapolated to the attitude towards its employees. <br><br>  For job seekers - take your job search seriously as a job.  Starting from the selection of vacancies and mailing resumes, and ending with interviews and assignments.  And again - be courteous with people.  Do not disappear, do not be late and do not delay the deadlines, otherwise, at least warn. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/285356/">https://habr.com/ru/post/285356/</a></p>
