  <section class="page js-page"><h1>One day at Web 2.0 Expo. Impressions.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Yesterday I had a chance to visit the <a href="http://en.oreilly.com/webexsf2008/public/content/home">Web 2.0 Expo</a> .  I was very happy, because it looks like this is one of the largest events of this kind.  Yes, and an impressive list of sponsors did not give reason to doubt the seriousness of this event. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Despite all my efforts, I was a little late for the beginning.  So I can't tell you about what Brady Forrest from O'Reilly Media, Inc. was talking about.  and Jennifer Pahlka from TechWeb. <br><br>  So, the approximate time is 9 hours and 15 minutes in the morning - Moscone Center, San Francisco.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Battelle">John Battelle</a> and <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Andreessen">Marc Andreessen</a></b> (one of the founders of Netscape) talk in the main conference hall.  They talked about everything a little bit.  Few remembered the glorious times of the struggle Netscape Navigator with IE.  From this part of their conversation, I learned that Netscape was not only developing the browser, but also creating websites, and even at some point was the largest advertising company on the Internet.  A little about social networks, in the context of the current platform for creating social networks on the interests of <a href="http://www.ning.com/">Ning</a> , which Mark is currently busy with. <br><br>  Further on the program was supposed to be <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Zittrain">Jonathan Zittrain</a></b> (professor from Oxford), but for some not very clear reasons he could not be present and sent a video instead of himself, while he himself sat in a chat room on meebo, where, if he wanted, to ask questions.  He basically scared everyone about how everything would be terrible when the Internet knew everything about us.  And strongly recommended that all platform developers, like Facebook, protect themselves by depriving themselves of the opportunity to interfere in the lives of their creations.  Thus, if one day there is a call from above with a directive to remove an objectionable application running on their platform, they will be able to say with a clear conscience that this is not in their power.  And of course he did not forget to advertise his new book, The Future of the Internet and How to Stop It.

      Then spoke <b>Mitchell Baker</b> - Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Mozilla Foundation and the Mozilla Corporation.  She mainly talked about the mobile Internet and that in the near future, Firefox, in particular for mobile devices, will get rid of the very concept of ‚Äúmobile Internet‚Äù.  She also remembered her original <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitchell_Baker">hairstyle</a> and the constant use of the word Firefox (even when it would be more logical to say Gecko or Mozilla). <br><br>  After it, CTO spoke Yahoo!  - <b>Ari Balogh</b> .  He said that Yahoo!  will become more open.  They plan to provide third-party developers with the ability to create small applications that can be integrated directly into various Yahoo services! .. You can read more about this <a href="http://www.ysearchblog.com/archives/000534.html">here</a> . <br><br>  Then a certain citizen Ofer Shaked from <a href="http://www.current.com/">www.current.com</a> spoke.  This is another news site that is filled with information from users.  He spoke rather dullly, and having looked at the time, I decided to move on. <br><br>  From this point on, the general part ended and the people sold out to several audiences where there were reports on various topics related to the Internet.  I decided to listen to a report called <b>‚ÄúMobile Ajax and the Future of the Web‚Äù</b> , read by Daniel Appelquist from Vodafone.  He again spoke a lot about the fact that the mobile Internet is developing very quickly.  True, unlike Mrs. Baker, he argued that there should be a difference between the normal Internet and the Internet for mobile devices, due to the presence of both serious limitations (size) and fundamentally new features (location information) of mobile devices.  From useful, he told that work is underway to create some best practices for mobile web application developers and gave some examples.  And perhaps the most interesting was the link to <a href="http://dev.w3.org/2008/mobile-test/test.html">Mobile Acid Test</a> . <br><br>  Next was a rather long break for lunch, after which I planned to visit a report entitled <b>‚ÄúOntologies for the Enterprise‚Äù</b> .  There they were supposed to talk about the semantic web and how it is urgent for everyone to start implementing it.  But since the break was rather long, I decided to walk around the center of San Francisco, as a result, the good weather and beautiful city did their job and I decided to skip this report ... <br><br>  Next on my list was <b>‚ÄúThe Art of Testing Web Applications‚Äù</b> performed by Gregg Pollack with <a href="http://www.railsenvy.com/">Rails Envy</a> .  Here they told about <a href="http://behaviour-driven.org/">Behavior Driven Development</a> in general and RSpec in particular.  What it is now, I will not try to explain, I think it would be better to follow the link and learn everything firsthand.  I got the impression that for a unit testing BDD is no better than standard approaches, but for integration tests it represents a certain value, since it allows shifting the work of writing them from the developers to someone else, in some cases it is even possible to the client. <br><br>  And lastly I had a report about <b>‚ÄúGoogle App Engine‚Äù</b> .  He was represented by Kevin Gibbs - the main Google in App Engine.  He told in general about Google App Engine, but did not say anything new.  The only thing at some point he was reassured by all, saying that only support for Python is temporary and adding new languages ‚Äã‚Äãwill not be difficult, but still at the end answering questions from the audience said that it is not known when support for other languages ‚Äã‚Äãwill appear. <br><br>  I must admit that my expectations were not justified.  Most of the reports were very superficial and not very informative.  Apparently this is primarily a place for communication of people working with the Internet, and all these reports are mainly for not very technical people and only for superficial acquaintance. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/24195/">https://habr.com/ru/post/24195/</a></p>
