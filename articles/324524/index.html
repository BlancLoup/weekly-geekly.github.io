This time, we are going to Innopolis to study a new city and university, which we have only heard about so far.  Before the school, we plan to manage to conduct a methodical intensive course for teachers on the basis of a project on the Internet of Things and an information security meeting. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/daf/dd8/173/dafdd8173829075c65af4dfad66fe64c.jpg" alt="image"><br>  # already left <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  About school.  Participants are waiting for 4 directions: application programming, bioinformatics, machine learning and robotics, which is now fashionable to call cyberphysics.  Both large projects are planned, for example, for voice work, Reinforcement learning and information security, as well as small projects for beginning designers, with whom we will make the first telegram bots and mobile applications, analyze social networks and improve the base.

      By tradition, we hold a competition for free participation in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gNRJj2TxZW-q4weUFUWZJ4s4BmjPgsv1yK1WZsOI4Nk/edit%3Fusp%3Dsharing">GoTo Challenge</a> school.  This time we asked everyone who wanted to take part to make a telegram-bot for the school, which would help the participants learn everything about the school, and let the organizers notify promptly and organize various events, issue awnings, etc.  We will soon announce the results in social networks, while you can be curious and see examples of work: <a href="https://github.com/AlexanderVoronkov/GoToHub">one</a> , <a href="https://github.com/shtirlets/GoTo_Challenge_Spring_2017">two</a> , <a href="https://github.com/alxmamaev/fedot-bot">three</a> . <br><br>  <b>A little about directions and intensity:</b> <b><br></b> <br>  Application programming <br><br>  As always, the application programming section will be divided into two streams: the ‚Äúyoung fighter course‚Äù and the ‚Äúproject‚Äù course.  In the framework of KMB, we will better master Python and during the school we will implement several mini-projects, for example, we will work with external APIs and get acquainted with SNA.  On the project flow, we have prepared large project tasks for the participants, which will require you to thoughtfully think through the concept, design and implementation, and a series of projects for those who do not feel confident in long-distance races and long-term projects. <br>  One of the projects that we will offer is a special project with the Charity Shop to create a service to help collect things.  The guys will do the service to optimize the cost of time, resources and inform the loader about which of their boxes spread around the city are already filled with clothes, using a module made by robotics for inserting into them. <br><br>  Robotics <br><br>  Experienced guys will take up immediately for the projects - they will go through all stages from idea to implementation.  The second stream is specifically designed for beginners who will get basic skills and tools: get acquainted with the Arduino platform and development environment;  will learn to work with various sensors, microcircuits, servomotors, etc.  and combine it all to get smart devices.  Each participant of the direction will receive a result in the form of a prototype or a complete device by the end of the school, and will also take a series of master classes in design work, industrial design and 3D printing, the Internet of things. <br><br>  A good example of a project from this direction, which was continued and supported by Intel, is a smart dumbbell.  The project was a success, and on March 31 we plan to conduct a free, <a href="https://leader-id.ru/event/3823/">free methodical intensive course</a> for all teachers interested in a project-based approach to education and the Internet of things. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7d5/384/58a/7d538458a093e70ad262a78b04c067f7.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  At the school in Innopolis, it is planned to launch a similar story with a bunch of hardware and machine learning using the example of a project with voice control.  <a href="http://edurobots.ru/2017/03/goto-projects/">Here</a> you can read about projects in this area since the last school. <br><br>  Bioinformatics <br><br>  During the week, participants will get acquainted with a variety of problems and tasks of bioinformatics.  The topics covered will include both commonly used algorithms (for example, sequence alignment) and more specialized ones (prediction of the secondary structure of RNA molecules, determination of the origin according to genotyping, etc.).  Every time we will go from a specific question that arises in modern biological research, try to figure out how to get an answer to it, study existing approaches, implement one of them and apply to real data.  Advanced participants will be invited to work on their own project based on a real bioinformatics problem.  Project examples: <br><ul><li>  Research on the gene regulatory network: simplifying the graph, identifying the most significant components and connections. </li><li>  Search for de novo predicted V genes in short readings of the genome by filtering by k-measures, aligning and classifying its results. </li></ul><br><br>  Machine learning <br><br>  In this direction, the guys are also divided into 2 streams.  In the first, a series of master classes from teachers of the SAS takes place, which helps to get acquainted with the main tasks of ML, to realize their first projects on price prediction and recognition of cats, to train their first neurons.  The second stream takes up work on projects with the use of and more detailed immersion in the currently fashionable areas: deep learning, recommendation systems, RL, etc. <br>  This direction is very popular among adults, and we often receive applications from 30-year-old uncles.  For them, we launched a <a href="https://goto.msk.ru/math_course/">course on introduction to the basics of data analysis</a> , solid and long, it starts on March 25 in Red October, it is 2 months on weekends. <br><br>  <b>School bonuses and mitap</b> <b><br></b> <br>  Security by Default <br><br>  We are planning to introduce information security into all GoTo educational programs, and at this school we will begin to acquaint children with information security in a variety of contexts. <br>  As a first step, we are <b>holding GoTo Meetup: Security be Default</b> in March, where we will look at the life of software in general, including writing safe code, administering and UX, and discuss how to do it better. <br>  While we are used to doing physical infrastructure like bridges or houses taking into account wind and earthquakes, we often begin to think about the reliability of software after serious incidents.  This is demonstrated both by Heartbleed, Cloudbleed or Shellshock, as well as thousands of open database servers, webcams and printers that are easy to find on the Internet. <br>  This is due to the current development culture, focused on functionality, often at the cost of security, ease of support and reliability.  And the lack of interaction between programmers, system administrators and users.  And the development of obscure interfaces.  And many more such "and", because security is a process. <br>  <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/1J2OnxzDjVjmq1Qr2">We invite everyone</a> to discuss these problems, as well as learn to notice and prevent them like this in advance.  Bring your projects or ideas for discussion with experts to find out what can go wrong with them. <br><br>  Communication Laboratory <br><br>  Within the framework of the project, the Communication Laboratory and GoTo schools will host the business ‚ÄúScientific Anticrisis‚Äù, the participants of which will become professional journalists and scientific communicators for several hours.  The first is to create your own media in a modeled information flow.  Guys are not limited in the choice of topics and formats, distribution of duties and editorial policy, the only rule is to be remembered by the audience, to be informative and interesting.  The second (scientific communicators) will have a complex task - to create and preserve the reputation of their scientific institution, get into the newspapers with good news and level reputational risks from pseudoscientific and bureaucratic scandals that suddenly appear in the news feed, and also become visible in the media field using all the methods not prohibited by law. <br>  Participants will be divided into press services of NASA, CERN, MIPT, IBC RAS, RCC, etc., will be offered to compete for media attention. <br><br>  CROC's IT-Project Business Career Guidance Game <br><br>  Especially for schoolchildren and undergraduates interested in mathematics, computer science, information technology, CROC has developed a business career guidance game ‚ÄúIT project‚Äù.  School participants are waiting for a complete immersion in the atmosphere of an IT project.  In the process, the guys will face the same surprises and difficulties as the real project teams.  After going through all the stages of the project, participants will be able to understand what types of activities in the field of IT are close to them and where their abilities can be claimed. <br><br>  Echpochmaks, chak-chak and innovations, in general, we are going to take Kazan. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/35c/86e/519/35c86e5190f3a1fe489b4e71ae3b69df.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  We will be glad to all who wish to join and share knowledge and experience with participants in any format, write to us.  Alga! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/324524/">https://habr.com/ru/post/324524/</a></p>
