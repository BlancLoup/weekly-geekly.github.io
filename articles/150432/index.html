IT-Portfolio is now a recruiting company with a strong web component and a news portal. <br><br>  Briefly about us you can say this: "We find work for super-professionals and publish news of the IT industry." <br><br><h2>  vuPAd </h2><br><img src="http://cs405616.userapi.com/v405616072/1f80/Rqq2GT_lMzg.jpg" alt="Vupad"><br><br>  <a href="http://prelaunch.vupad.me/">This</a> project will allow you to try on vases, sofas, armchairs and other furniture in the apartment or unusual places right on the tablet screen.  Point the camera at a future place for a sofa in your room - and voila! <br><br><h2>  Parhagon </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/344/0cd/0c9/3440cd0c90e41dd53c43d40d4a1bec34.png"><br>  Parhagon SAS, a project based on the 101st Avenue Champs Elys√©es in Paris, is a service of original auctions for luxury goods and services. <br><br>  We have developed a time-limited auction model, in which the winner of the auction will receive the goods at a price not exceeding 10% of the market price, and the owners will be able to receive guaranteed benefits corresponding to their goods. <br><br><h2>  Korja.us </h2><br>  Is the setophor broken?  Flooded the street?  Take a photo on your smartphone, specify the location and inform the relevant services! <br>  <a href="http://korja.us/">Korja.us</a> makes this process reflexively reflexive. <br><br>  Korja is a service for automated collection and tracking of "non-critical" incidents in the city.  Made with love and attention to modern urban infrastructure, it is convenient for citizens to use and easy to implement in management structures. <br><br><h2>  Parland </h2><br><img src="http://cs304404.userapi.com/v304404230/4f7f/lGM4jEDh_HE.jpg"><br><br>  Many artists and photographers go unnoticed?  This is all untrue!  After all, there ParLand.ru! <br>  <a href="http://parland.ru/">ParLand.ru</a> is a set of tools for promoting the work of artists and photographers both on the Internet and in the real world. <br><br>  The project allows creative individuals to bring their work to a wide audience, through contests and tournaments on the site, keeping their mini-blogs, in which users can add their own news, give lessons and conduct lectures online, create thematic communities, online galleries. <br>  And the best works take part in offline exhibitions of St. Petersburg! <br><br>  Today 5 galleries are connected, we will take part in several exhibitions, we will organize one of them (photo exhibition) with the support of the city administration, hold competitions in a group in VK, 1,500 works on the old version of the site. <br>  The launch of the beta version of the updated project is planned for August 30, 2012. <br><br><h2>  LocalEvents </h2><br><img src="http://sumit3.pbworks.com/f/1343218514/%D0%9B%D0%BE%D0%B3%D0%BE%D1%82%D0%B8%D0%BF%20%28%D1%87%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B9%20%D1%81%20%D0%B3%D0%BE%D0%BB%D1%83%D0%B1%D1%8B%D0%BC%29.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <a href="http://localevents.ru/">LocalEvents</a> is a web service that allows you to freely navigate in the whole variety of events hosted on Facebook and VKontakte social networks, as well as helping to find certain events and meetings and prompting the most interesting ones in accordance with the requests and preferences of users and their friends. <br><br>  In addition, in the future, the site will provide a number of interesting opportunities for event organizers, such as creating events with automatic publication on various resources simultaneously, promotion tools, ticket sales, etc. <br><br>  In the future, we plan to provide visitors with the opportunity to conveniently interact with all events posted on social networks - and this is about 30 thousand per month only in Moscow and St. Petersburg for VKontakte and more than 16 million events worldwide on Facebook. <br><br>  LocalEvents is focused on active users of social networks between the ages of 16 and 26 who are interested in the cultural life of their city, as well as organizers of events of any level who form it. <br><br><br><h2>  My Donor </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/992/8ad/8d3/9928ad8d3b3fca10fdfad5018bd8ca87.png"><br><br>  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe <a href="http://xn--d1ajigccbq.xn--p1ai/">project</a> is to create an Internet resource that will enable donors and people who need them to quickly and easily find each other.  Surely you have repeatedly met with such announcements: ‚ÄúBlood is urgently required for a child!  Group number n.  Tel.  ... "  Unfortunately, not all of them are real, and hundreds of people every day really need urgent transfusions, and many can help!  Being a donor is easy and safe.  For the convenience of interaction, a system will be created in which you can safely leave your contact details (telephone, email).  All information will be absolutely confidential, and at the same time the site will instantly notify that someone needs your help.  The donor will not pester the site - there will not be constant rampant emails and spam. <br><br><h2>  DiscoverBeauty.ru - discover your beauty! </h2> <br><img src="http://sumit3.pbworks.com/f/1343199150/1343199150/ab2.jpg"><br><br>  What for?  Because before you buy, I want to try! <br><br>  We want every girl to be able to afford more shopping, to be contented and attractive.  But in the rhythm of modern life it is difficult to find time for shopping.  As a result, in conditions of limited time and under the influence of beautiful advertising pictures, girls often buy what they don‚Äôt need, don‚Äôt like, don‚Äôt fit, or even harm! <br>  And recent studies in Europe have shown that many people are prevented from shopping on the Internet that the goods cannot be touched, sniffed and inspected from all sides ... <br>  On the other hand, we know that the promotion of new products in the field of perfumery and cosmetics is a constant headache for manufacturers and distributors.  Moreover, it is very expensive! <br><br>  We combine solutions to all these problems in one project!  However, while it concerns only cosmetics ... <br>  How?  Using the user profile, we select an individual set of mini-packs of well-known manufacturers of cosmetics and deliver them to your home. <br>  There, in a relaxed atmosphere, the client will be able to test everything, and decide what exactly she needs. <br><br>  PS Men will have to wait a little longer, a special version of the site is almost ready for them. <br><br><h2>  Tigeroy </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a80/977/d2b/a80977d2b001cab64a779dd933a852fe.png"><br><br>  Get new knowledge and meet people with similar desires, thanks to thematic classes.
