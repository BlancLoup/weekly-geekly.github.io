The text will allow you to understand clearly enough what Samsung is preparing for us in the near future. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>Samsung, with its <a href="http://www.computerbild.ru/%3Fdid%3D903_2675">Q1</a> , is now one of the leaders.</b>  <b>How did the market take this device?</b> <br><br>  People took Q1 with utterly overwhelming enthusiasm.  For most buyers, this device is extremely convenient for its low weight and modest size allowing them not to part with the computer all day.  The business has found an opportunity to implement fully-functional, vertically integrated applications, such as trade automation, medical information systems, etc.  Educational institutions are also interested in the wide distribution of such devices among students.  Interest is really extremely high.

      <b>UMPC is now limited by the requirements for battery capacity, processor capabilities and chipset power.</b>  <b>What does Samsung do to overcome these obstacles?</b> <br><br>  When creating mobile computers, you always have to keep a balance between battery life, system performance and device size.  This balance is discussed in detail by developers when planning a product.  To achieve the desired parameters of battery life, engineers have to carefully check the battery capacity and processor power, which will achieve the required performance.  This difficult task has to be solved in conjunction with the design of the case and enter into its limited size and weight.  And of course, when developing, we are trying to find all new technologies that will make the device faster, smaller, easier and work as long as possible. <br><br>  The next generation of ultra-portable PCs will take advantage of new Intel processors, which have reduced power requirements, which means longer battery life.  They will also be more compact.  Unfortunately, it is necessary to understand that the overall performance of such devices will be somewhat lower than that of the devices on the existing Mobile Pentium. <br><br>  <b>The advent of Vista is a test for UMPC manufacturers and their followers.</b>  <b>At the same time, the market requires the most innovative solutions, and now it means Windows Aero.</b>  <b>Are there plans to build Aero compatible devices in the near future?</b> <br><br>  Absolutely.  And we are going to work more closely with the chip manufacturers to reduce power consumption while increasing the graphics capabilities and reducing the size of the electronic components used in our devices. <br><br>  <b>The decision to include <a href="http://www.ixbt.com/news/index.php%3Fstr%3Dssd%26x%3D0%26y%3D0">SSD</a> in the Q1 model is excellent in performance, speed and battery life, but extremely burdensome for the wallet.</b>  <b>Will the line remain with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSD">SSD</a> luxury, or will Samsung work with partners to reduce prices and bring technology to the mass market?</b> <br><br>  SSD is still a new technology but, unfortunately, the price for it is so far that devices with its use are expensive.  Samsung is one of the leaders in the production of memory chips and, as such, the company is working to reduce prices for SSDs.  You can expect that as soon as it becomes possible to make a massive offer, such devices will be included in mass products. <br><br>  <b>Let's talk about reliability: UMPC can be used in many adverse places for conventional PCs and laptops.</b>  <b>Is it planned to release a protected version of Q1?</b> <br><br>  We again return to the discussion of balance.  Adding industrial protection to a product means increasing the size and weight of the device.  As for the SSD, then yes, the addition of such a drive really allows you to completely abandon the moving parts in the computer and increases reliability.  Samsung will work with third-party manufacturers when they create secure devices based on Q1. <br><br>  <b>At the moment, the presence of LED backlighting in newer versions of Q1P is widely discussed.</b>  <b>This is really a very useful innovation.</b>  <b>Could you tell us more about this?</b> <br><br>  This is one example of the use of technology developed within Samsung.  LED backlighting consumes less energy, which makes it ideal for use in devices with small sizes and allows you to extend the battery life. <br><br>  <b>Does Samsung have plans to create a device as small as OQO O2?</b> <br><br>  We can not comment on future, not announced products, but I can assure you that Samsung is always looking forward when planning new devices. <br><br>  <b>Are there plans to increase compatibility between the Q1 line and other Samsung products, such as mobile phones?</b> <br><br>  Not quite clear question.  Samsung believes that there will always be a need for separate cell phones that may have some additional functionality, such as MP3, camera, etc.  As for the UMPC, the need to introduce mobile phone functions into this device is not paramount for us.  We believe that at the moment such functionality will not be required by a wide range of users. <br><br>  <b>Now the Internet is rapidly growing "social" sites.</b>  <b>Wikipedia, MySpace and YouTube are among the most popular sites in America, of course, right after the search engines.</b>  <b>Will the UMPC Samsung change under the pressure of these sites?</b> <br><br>  In terms of the desire of users to be in touch always, everywhere, we can say that Samsung hears the ‚Äúvoice of customers‚Äù and now these wishes have a significant impact on the development of new devices. <br><br>  <b>If we talk about a "magic function" that you would like to implement in Q1, but this is not yet possible, what is it?</b> <br><br>  This feature is the ability to work autonomously for 8 hours without an extended battery or any other additional power, without reducing performance and increasing the size of the device. <br><br>  <b>Thank you for taking the time and answering the questions.</b> <br><br>  Source: <a href="http://ultramobilegeek.blogspot.com/2007/02/interview-with-samsung.html">ThoughtFix</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/3510/">https://habr.com/ru/post/3510/</a></p>
