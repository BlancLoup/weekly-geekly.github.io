  <section class="page js-page"><h1>And we called the advertising campaign ‚ÄúDediki from Dedkov‚Äù</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Good afternoon, dear readers of Habr! <br><img src="http://firstdedic.ru/dedic/8.jpg" alt="image" align="left"><br>  I want to tell you a story about how our advertising character was born.  Maybe this story will give someone the direction of thought, it will help someone to unleash their creative potential and create something similar, while it will be just nice for someone to see funny pictures. <br>  Last June, our marketing department was tasked with launching a new project on dedicated servers.  Immediately, I note that the guys in our department are talented and creative.  We did not want to do something regular and ordinary, so we started with the unusual.  Our plans were incredibly audacious, we wanted the new project to become a brand as soon as possible, so we remembered the university lessons in psychology and marketing and decided to come up with an advertising character. <a name="habracut"></a><br>  We began to argue with what dedicated servers are.  So, a <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2592%25D1%258B%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25B9_%25D1%2581%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580">dedicated server (born dedicated server) is a type of hosting in which the client is completely provided with a separate physical machine (as opposed to virtual hosting).</a>  <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2592%25D1%258B%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25B9_%25D1%2581%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580">Usually used to run applications that can not coexist on the same server with other projects or have increased resource requirements.</a>  We started to ‚Äúdance‚Äù from the word Dedicated and literally immediately the character‚Äôs image was born - Grandfather.  However, we didn‚Äôt want our servers to be associated with a man in years; we wanted our Grandfather to be young, naughty, experienced and very advanced!  The task was complicated, but we did not lose heart.  Together with our friend and a wonderful freelance designer (at that time) <a href="http://mcreal.ru/">Alexey Guk,</a> we began to develop versions of the image of our future Grandfather.  They turned 7. <br><img src="http://firstdedic.ru/dedic/all.jpg" alt="image"><br>  All the grandfathers turned out fun and funny, but it was not him - the very one and only.  A test drive of our company's employees showed that we will not come to a consensus: opinions were divided and were diametrically opposed.  Someone, mostly to our theoretical physicists, was close to Grandfather No. 3, because the image of a nuclear physicist came close to my heart in my thoughts.  Fans to drink tea and chat liked option number 7.  Therefore, we decided to look for compromise ways.  We combined the upper part of Grandfather No. 3 and the lower part of Grandfather No. 7, it was already getting ‚Äúwarmer‚Äù, but something was still missing. <br>  - And let's make him another ear ring?  - persuaded me our guys. <br>  The idea seemed very provocative to me, and I said: ‚ÄúOh, come on!‚Äù <br>  And that same Grandfather, whom we so wanted to see, appeared before our eyes. <br>  And even its variations! <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e55/eaa/cef/e55eaacef790d51ff4fae242cd8c8239.jpg" alt="image"><br>  It only remains for us to dress him in a branded overalls with the company logo and send to the site so that he becomes the face of the <a href="http://firstdedic.ru/">FirtsDEDIC.ru</a> project </div>
