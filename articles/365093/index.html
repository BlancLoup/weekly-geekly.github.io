  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Tesla Motors has problems with sales of electric cars in China</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b4d/281/29d/b4d28129de880d68dbb3d02a48c7b15a.jpg"><br><br>  The head of Tesla Motors Ilon Musk is going to dismiss a number of senior managers from the Chinese division of the company.  The reason is the low level of sales of electric vehicles, according to this indicator, China lags behind the estimated level.  So, for the last month, <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/02/10/us-tesla-china-exclusive-idUSKBN0LE2Q320150210">only 120 electric vehicles</a> were sold across the Middle Kingdom.  But Musk hopes to bring the level of sales of Tesla electric cars in China to those in the US by the end of this year. <br><br>  Two top managers from China have already left the company in 2014, perhaps because of Tesla's weak sales in this country.  And on January 13 of this year, the value of the company's shares fell by 7% for the same reason - the company‚Äôs work in China was not very good, investors were expecting several other indicators.  However, Musk is not losing optimism, and argues that by the middle of this year the situation will be rectified. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  According to sources from Tesla, at the end of January, Musk sent a message to the managers of the company in China stating that he was fired if there were no positive results and the current situation was corrected.

      There is frustration because of what - because this year Musk hoped to increase the sales of electric cars to 50 thousand cars a year.  And by 2020, the plan for the year is 500 thousand, and the main hope of the company is laying on the markets of the United States and China.  In the US, everything is fine so far, but China has not yet reached the level of the ‚Äúlargest‚Äù market for Tesla.  However, as early as 2025, Musk hopes to sell several million different Tesla models per year.  Already this year, Musk hopes, the level of sales of electric vehicles in China should reach the level of sales in the USA. <br><br>  If this does not happen, then many managers in the Chinese division of the company will either be fired or transferred to lower positions. <br><br>  As a matter of fact, Tesla is still not making a profit, which, of course, upsets investors.  Last year, however, the price of the company's shares rose by 48%.  But this year, the stock price has slightly decreased, due to not too good news.  However, the company has no choice but to move forward.  And knowing the character of Mask, you can be sure that he will fight to the end. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/365093/">https://habr.com/ru/post/365093/</a></p>
