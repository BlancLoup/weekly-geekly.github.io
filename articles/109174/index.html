But I will add a couple more kopecks, for I consider this to be a rather important remark, which, perhaps, will make someone think. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  User <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/piepl/" class="user_link">piepl</a> in his topic <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/personal/100372/">Our new personal data</a> (thanks to him, by the way, for a rather interesting analysis) cited as an example the point of the rules of "Vkontakte" as a benchmark, namely: <br><br>  <b>In paragraph 4.8 of the Vkontakte social network rules the following is written.</b>

And at least when I chose the option ‚Äúdelete page‚Äù, I was assured that in a month it would not be. <br><br>  But it was just one of the examples of how the ‚ÄúProcessing of the User‚Äôs personal data is carried out in accordance with the legislation of the Russian Federation.‚Äù In the main social network of the Russian Internet. <br><br>  But I decided to conduct my small investigation further. <br><br>  In the section "Vkontakte" <a href="http://vkontakte.ru/help.php%3Fpage%3Dabout">about the site</a> is the legal address: <br> <code> " ", -,  ., . 8, . </code> <br> <br>  For the sake of scientific interest, I looked into the State Register of Legal Entities, and (about a miracle), I <a href="http://egrul.nalog.ru/fns/g.php%3Fo%3D1079847035179">found it</a> . <br><br>  The INN of our LLC <s>"Chamomile"</s> "In Contact" <b>7842349892</b> <br><br>  Skopipastiv INN, I went to the official website of Roskomnadzor, namely in the section <a href="http://www.rsoc.ru/personal-data/register/">Registry of operators engaged in the processing of personal data</a> <br>  Enter the TIN and see the following: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/277b70e3/0d816314/cac743d8/f3b1625d.jpg"><br><br>  So, one of the largest operators of personal data in Russia, not only does not comply with the elementary legislation of Russia itself, does not even bother to enter its LLC into ‚Äúsome kind of registry‚Äù, which it is obliged to enter as according to the law and by definition. <br><br>  <b>Findings?</b>  Do it yourself ... </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/109174/">https://habr.com/ru/post/109174/</a></p>
