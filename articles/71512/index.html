      You have already met <b>Vika Zhislin</b> in the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/intel/blog/69549/">first week</a> with Intel at Habrahabr.  Prior to joining Intel, Vika worked in a company where she worked on a 3D graphic library <b>Geometry Engine</b> .  At that time, there was an idea that the software could ‚Äúbeat‚Äù graphics adapters in speed, so Vika was involved in creating a well-optimized library, which should have done so. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/068/d53/ab9/068d53ab91af4de6bf749c91096e6b5f.jpg" alt="Vika Zhislina"><br><br>  <b>Philip Gerasimov</b> worked at a well-known company <b>NVIDIA</b> , where he worked in collaboration with developers of three-dimensional programs and computer games on optimization issues.  He traveled a lot, mainly in Europe, talking with developers and helping them to switch to new technologies.  The next logical step was the company Intel - Philip believes that Intel has interesting plans for new graphics architectures, so he joined Intel last year.  Its main task is to support the <b>Larrabee SDK</b> , which is now in full swing: interaction with both external developers and internal ones;  improved SDK, help in writing documentation, new ideas for demo samples and so on. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f4a/0dd/1e4/f4a0dd1e44f4a1322c583ca9af697c26.jpg" alt="Philip gerasimov"><br><br>  <b>Vladimir Travkin</b> worked in a large Russian outsourcing company that cooperates primarily with telecom;  Two years ago, he was called to Intel as a project manager for the <b>Graphics Performance Tools</b> , which he does now, creating an <b>Intel Graphics Performance Analyzers</b> toolkit for optimizing graphics applications. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6e9/a23/a28/6e9a23a288d1ba8621a6a0e2b07b9ec7.jpg" alt="Vladimir Travkin"><br><br><h2>  What questions of readers are you ready to answer?  For example, is it possible to ask about Larrabee? </h2><br>  <b>Vic</b> : Ask.  It is clear that we can not tell all, for example, it is pointless to ask us about the specific predicted performance of Larrabee, or about the number of its cores at the time of release.  But we are wondering exactly what will be asked - depending on this, we will somehow adjust our actions.  For example, we can try to convince the authorities to open some information on this project, expand the circle of developers admitted to Larrabee SDK, and so on. <br><br><h2>  What is the development stage for Larrabee? </h2><br>  <b>Vic</b> : We already have engineering samples in the laboratories.  They are not ready for sale, at least I would not have sold mine :), but presumably they will appear on the market as early as 2010. <br><br><h2>  Many people ask questions about GPGPU, general purpose GPU - can you discuss this interesting topic with our readers? </h2><br>  <b>Philip</b> : Of course, we can touch on this topic - we cannot tell everything, but we'll tell you something about GPGPU.  Here I must say that in addition to a whole range of work on the Larrabee SDK, I am doing about the same kind of activity related to Graphics Performance Analyzers - a set of tools designed to optimize computer graphics;  Now it is primarily concerned with integrated graphics adapters and chipsets.  Literally today we will talk about this in Moscow at the GraphiCon conference. <br><br><h2>  If you compare the built-in graphics and discrete - what are the main differences? </h2><br>  <b>Vic</b> : The integrated graphics cards have their advantages - they are inexpensive, we can say that they are completely free - they are embedded in the motherboard;  they do not heat up - there is practically nothing to warm themselves, they are reliable and do not make noise, there are no moving parts.  Naturally, one cannot say that the integrated graphics cards are very powerful, but we are constantly improving them.  Intel ranks first in the prevalence of the integrated graphics market; moreover, it is now even more than discrete at the expense of integrated graphics notebooks. <br>  Therefore, developers need to be explained how, with such limited capabilities, to make programs ‚Äî first of all, games ‚Äî work no worse than discrete adapters, or at least just work correctly. <br><br><h2>  What would you be interested in talking to readers about? </h2><br>  <b>Philip</b> : We will be able to answer all the questions about optimizing graphics applications.  In addition, I could tell you about new effects in computer graphics. <br><br>  <b>Vladimir</b> : I would be interested to talk with game developers - what tools do they use to optimize their applications, what problems do they have and how can we help them, what new features can we add to our tools.  I can tell you about optimizing graphics applications for DirectX, answer any questions about Intel GPA and project management.  Most likely, I will keep silent about Larrabee and some deep technical details. <br><br>  <b>Vic</b> : I am pleased to discuss the problems of working with integrated graphics and any issues related to it.  In addition, my themes are Larrabee New Instructions (this is a new set of SIMD instructions implemented in Larrabee) and general issues of interaction between modern GPUs and CPUs. <br><br>  .................................................. .................................................. ............................................. <br><br>  Let me remind you that we already had: <br><br>  - <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/intel/blog/69377/">Announcement of the program</a> " <b>5 weeks with Intel</b> " <br>  - <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/intel/blog/69549/">First week</a> - <b>Intel Architecture and Application Optimization</b> <br>  - <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/intel/blog/70211/">Second Week</a> - " <b>Intel Development Tools</b> " <br>  - <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/intel/blog/70818/">Third week</a> - " <b>WiMAX in Russia</b> " <br><br>  You can read - the most interesting was in the comments, although in an interview we tried;) <br><br>  .................................................. .................................................. ............................................. <br><br>  By the way, our scouts are still looking for a happy owner of the main <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/intel/blog/69377/">prize</a> .  They do not know what he looks like, but they know that he has to make a sign - ask such a question in the comments, according to the interesting level of which Intel employees will say ‚ÄúYes, this is it!‚Äù In one voice. <br><br>  Perhaps you have not been able to find the answer to some elementary question for a long time, but it will be this very one that many people just cannot sleep at ease with.  Or maybe this is such a serious technical question that the discussions to it will lead to the appearance of some ingenious ideas and misdeeds for someone :) So, do not hesitate! <br><br>  And further.  What would you like to talk about next week?  We are not proud and accept applications!  ;) <br>  And for those who inarguably puts the cons of the post, we have prepared the ancient curses;) <br><br>  <b>Successes!</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/71512/">https://habr.com/ru/post/71512/</a></p>
