  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Interns in the company: how and why? Pros and cons for the employer</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Everybody knows the truth - every year the shortage of qualified IT-specialists increases, the education system does not keep up with market trends.  In this regard, the cost of personnel will rise against the background of a decline in their quality. <br><br>  Many companies a few years ago saw the solution to their problems in attracting the attention of students;  some come to this just now.  Each self-respecting IT-department cooperates with several companies, each self-respecting technical university encourages the love of companies (most often not free of charge) to their students. <br><br>  What are the methods of integrating students into the environment?  Participation in career fairs.  Organization in the university days of the company.  Placement of information about vacancies and internships in the department or in the Student Employment Center.  Friendship with teachers and the selection of students on the recommendations through them.  Good help and employees of the company, teaching in IT-departments.  More costly business - the formation of its own training program on the basis of the department and direct contact with students in their classes.  Organization of summer schools for students of the department.  Holding contests, conferences, seminars.  And much more. <br>  Thanks to this, students from the initial courses hear the name of the company, know that it presents itself (from the inside as well) and understand how to get there.

      But now I want to dwell on the possible benefits and disadvantages for a company collaborating with young people. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Pros: <br><ul><li>  The ability to "blind" a specialist by yourself.  Here we are talking about both professional skills and commitment to the corporate culture of the company and the ability to work according to internal rules and regulations. </li><li>  More loyal employees grow out of youth.  No comments, this is a priori. </li><li>  Employees who have made a career within the company (albeit small) are usually cheaper than those taken from the market. </li><li>  The youth, thanks to their energy and integrity of mind with the baggage of experience, is able to bring new practices, optimize processes and generate new ideas for the benefit of the company. </li></ul><br><br>  Minuses: <br><ul><li>  Cost  For example, if a company participates in a job fair once a semester and holds a personal meeting with students, the total cost of this will be more than one hundred and fifty thousand a year.  But compared with the cost of recruiting this defect is imaginary. </li><li>  Some of the activities listed above are a long-term investment, the effect of which will manifest itself in a year or two or three years. </li><li>  If an employer makes a major stake only on young people, the result may be a deterioration in the aggregate intellectual of employees and, as a result, a decline in the quality of services provided. </li></ul><br><br>  Of course, the lists are complementary and my opinion can be challenged, so I invite everyone to the discussion - outside opinions are interesting. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/285568/">https://habr.com/ru/post/285568/</a></p>
