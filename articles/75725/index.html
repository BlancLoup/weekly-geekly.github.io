And the result, as will be seen below, can be achieved well. <br>  I note that I do not have a burning hatred, or the opposite feeling to any of them, so please do not stigmatize me in advance as a sober right-wielder, who does not see anything except his own personal disadvantaged "I". <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Well, let's begin the description of my chronicles. <br><br>  I use cellular communication from Megaphone.  No benefits or benefits - just historically.  Somewhere in the beginning of this year I receive a text message on my phone with something like this: ‚ÄúYou have the service‚Äú Replace beep ‚Äùconnected.  After 2 weeks of free use, you can disconnect by sending SMS to the number XXXX, otherwise a subscription fee in the amount of XX rubles will be charged. ‚Äù  I must say that by the nature of my activities (IT security, IT infrastructure) I have a healthy sense of paranoia, and the SMS in which is written <i>‚Äúblah blah blah ... send SMS to the bla bla bla bla number‚Äù</i> I consider spam and divorce to money, if 100% is not sure what it is and why it came.  Naturally, I deleted the incoming SMS, as soon as I read it, and after 15 seconds I completely forgot that it came.

      8 months have passed, summer has passed, holidays have passed.  Arriving from hospitable Siberia, I went to the site of Megaphone in order to check how many were counted for roaming.  Returning from long trips, I try to do it, because  I still hope to find some logic in these "numbers" :-).  For a moment I notice that the monthly bill contains a column ‚Äúpayment for services‚Äù.  Again, I must say that I have this ... policy or something, not to order something that I do not use, but because  I only need voice communication and sms from a mobile phone, then I should not have any services ... hmm ... interesting ... <br>  I start to unwind the chain, look at the bills, call the call center.  It turns out that the service "Replace the dial tone" (aha! I remember ... the beginning of the year ... sms ...) lives happily on my account and eats 45 rubles a month.  So, so ... interesting. <br><br>  Further events develop as follows: <br>  - I call the call center, saying that I did not connect this service and from where it appeared I have no idea - return the money (about 350 re accumulated there during these incomplete 8 months. Not much big money - but somehow ... ugly on their part , it is necessary to understand).  I answer that yes, yes, of course.  We accepted the application - we will instantly figure it out, punish the innocent, reward the guilty.  And all for 2 weeks.  Well, ok, I have already disabled the service through the site, so you can wait. <br>  After 2 weeks, SMS arrives.  The text is almost quoting ‚Äú <i>Dear Subscriber, according to your application No. XXXX, an inspection of the operation of the service Replace Beep was carried out.</i>  <i>Failures are not identified.</i>  <i>To get an answer on the application, you can contact the Subscriber Service ... blah blah bla</i> . <i>"</i>  Hmmm ... failures are not identified ... I wonder what they mean. <br><br>  - I call the call center.  I am told that everything is fine, the service was connected then, and just recently you disconnected - everything works correctly, no incorrect calculations were detected.  And so they literally "chopped off" it, so clearly and clearly formulated, that they couldn‚Äôt argue that they did not exist. <br>  Okay.  He sat, thought a little.  Some kind of irregularity looms.  I DIDN'T CONNECT this service, I was imposed on it.  I looked at the <a href="http://moscow.megafon.ru/download/docs/services/oferta_zameni_gudok.doc">Agreement</a> on this service on the site - everything is correct.  To connect it - you need to either send an SMS, or by phone to ask or on the website - well, in general, to do something meaningful to connect the service.  And I did not do anything like that!  Conclusion - the service imposed.  And this is a completely different calico.  Okay, another attempt. <br><br>  - I call the call center, I say my arguments, they say you think something is right, but I did not connect the service, it was you who vtyuhali it to me!  They answer - what you want from us, we sent you an SMS, offered to disconnect - you did not disconnect.  Well, they themselves are to blame.  Money will not be refunded.  Like, we informed you (via SMS) - and you made the decision not to turn off - well, everything is legal.  And again - so confidently, damn it ... and there is nothing to argue ... hehe :-) Well done, what can I say, correctly interpreted!  :-) <br><br>  Okay.  Having decided that the calls were calls, and before the megaphone office 20 minutes on foot, I walked to them at lunchtime and wrote a statement (it‚Äôs a thought: can they really say the same thing in writing? Well, I can WRONG the wrong way!).  Actually here is a scan.  Poor quality, because  made with a photocopy, which the manager kindly provided me with gritting teeth (apparently with joy). <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/938/7a7/ffe/9387a7ffef8be3b58b7c836ef979c86a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  I will omit the details of communication with the girl behind the desk, sadly, that's all, I‚Äôll just note that she looked at me ... well, like a heavyweight boxer at a fifth-grader schoolboy.  Not that it is very threatening, but also ... with a certain degree of contempt, saying ‚Äúwhere is the suessi, child?‚Äù  what complaints?  we all have chiki-oi. ‚ÄùThey teach them to do this on purpose‚Ä¶ Well, there‚Äôs no problem. <br><br>  <b>RESULT:</b> after about 2.5 weeks the money quietly appeared on the account.  And after 6 weeks I received a letter - the scans themselves are also attached. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f3b/825/6d2/f3b8256d26d067c9b8306647d74d1628.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3c4/b46/b37/3c4b46b3733842a862947b550e2299a6.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>A couple of thoughts about it all.</b> <br>  <b>1.</b> Service Replace Beep is now included in the "default" (!!) package of services seems to all tariffs megaphone.  Those.  as soon as you a) buy a new number, b) change the tariff, the service will automatically be activated.  And then everything will be according to the law - you will not reproach.  The only way to avoid overpaying money is to disconnect it immediately. <br>  <b>2.</b> The choice of this particular service as a default - for me, smacks than the bad.  I will never notice such a service myself as a subscriber, it is visible only for the one who calls ME (that is, not for me).  Is that a monthly account detail - but how many of us monitor it?  Nothing like?  A service sits for itself, for the user it is imperceptible, it slowly pumps money, not so much - but ‚Äúten old women are already a ruble.‚Äù  For some reason, I immediately have an association - pure trojan!  :-) <br>  <b>3.</b> in words (on calls), the call center and PPSO managers will be long and tedious to prove their case, even if they are wrong.  If you feel that you are right, it makes sense to write a complaint in writing. <br>  <b>4. The</b> answer of Megaphone is the brilliance of marketing thought :).  There is more than a ‚Äúwater‚Äù page about what a wonderful service, how good it is for all subscribers to use it - and one paragraph that the recalculation is due.  There are no apologies for (literally) misappropriated money in principle.  :-) Well, actually I would be more surprised if they were. <br>  <b>5.</b> In general, the method ‚Äúhere is a service for you, while it is free and then if you don‚Äôt disconnect - for money‚Äù in my opinion is wrong.  There is in this such ... petty calculation on the fact that a person will forget about the dates and at least a little, use for money, or even decide not to bother with disconnection.  It seems that a little leech sucks, let it live ... everything is a living creature ... you look and it will bring some benefit :-)) <br><br>  This moral: If you are sure that you are right, do not be afraid to defend your rights.  Justice exists. <br>  Good thoughts to you. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/75725/">https://habr.com/ru/post/75725/</a></p>
