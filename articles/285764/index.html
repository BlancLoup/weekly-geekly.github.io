      To date, the Department of <a href="http://mit.spbau.ru/">MIIT</a> offers training programs in three areas: <br><br>  <b>1. Theoretical computer science (computer science)</b> <br>  Theoretical computer science is an actively developing scientific field located at the junction of mathematics and computer science, the results of which are in demand both in basic science and in modern technologies.  The curriculum includes courses on algorithms, computational complexity, cryptography, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and more specialized subjects reflecting modern directions in computer science.  Many read courses are complemented by practical exercises in which students solve interesting and non-trivial tasks, allowing them to navigate the material at a level sufficient to conduct independent research.  The head of the training is a leading officer of <a href="http://www.pdmi.ras.ru/">POMI RAS</a> , a specialist in algorithms and complexity theory, Doctor of Physical and Mathematical Sciences <a href="http://logic.pdmi.ras.ru/~hirsch/">E.A. Girsh</a> .  Training and research is carried out with the direct participation of the staff of the Laboratory of Mathematical Logic of POMI RAS, as well as the laboratory of algorithmic methods created in 2014 under the guidance of the winner of the megagrand program of the professor <a href="http://www.ii.uib.no/~fomin/cv.html">F.V.Fomin</a> (Bergen, Norway).  The educational program is complemented by special courses of <a href="http://compsciclub.ru/">Computer Science Club</a> and trips to <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/spbau/blog/247915/">international student schools</a> . <br><br>  About training in this area can be found in the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/spbau/blog/175113/">recall of</a> our graduate. <br><br>  <b>2. Software development (software engineering)</b> <br>  The educational program was compiled in accordance with modern international standards with the participation of specialists from major Russian IT companies.  In the learning process, students participate in the development of software products under the guidance of experienced consultants working in the industry.  In addition to the basic courses (software development technology, object-oriented programming, databases, algorithms), specialized subjects are also taught (functional programming, parallel programming, machine learning, data analysis, computer vision, etc.).  The main focus is on individual practical work with students.  Student projects are carried out within the framework of a real production process based on the companies JetBrains, Yandex, Parallels, EMC, which are partners of the university.  This allows graduates to be sought-after professionals with experience in highly organized teams. <br><br>  Student's story about the direction of "software engineering" can be read <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/spbau/blog/139842/">here</a> . <br><br>  <b>3. Algorithmic bioinformatics (algorithmic bioinformatics)</b> <br>  The program, opened at the laboratory of algorithmic biology, headed by <a href="http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~ppevzner/">P. Pevzner</a> , a professor at the University of California at San Diego, includes in-depth courses on algorithms and data structures that are used in the analysis of large data arrays. <br>  Programming, discrete mathematics, fundamentals of molecular biology, statistics, machine learning, and other - more specialized - subjects are also being studied.  Students take part in solving real bioinformatics problems: <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/spbau/blog/238759/">developing algorithms and software systems for assembling genomes</a> , solving problems in the field of computational proteomics and mass spectrometry. <br><br>  Our student told about training in the program of algorithmic bioinformatics <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/spbau/blog/143115/">here</a> . <br><br>  <b>Academic University</b> <br>  St. Petersburg Academic University - Nanotechnology Research and Education Center of the Russian Academy of Sciences (Academic University) is a state university established in 1997 under the auspices of the Russian Academy of Sciences.  Our university has many advantages: a small set allows for almost individual training, increased scholarships, a lot of useful, including paid, practice, work on topical scientific and practical problems.  By the end of the master's course, students have all the opportunities to continue their studies and scientific and pedagogical activities in the postgraduate school of our or a foreign university, or to tackle practical tasks by entering the staff of a large prestigious company.  We collected some information about our graduates on our <a href="http://mit.spbau.ru/students">website</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5d7/339/9d5/5d73399d59bd4c1e8ec8e783da2eb1fc.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Arrival</b> <br>  For admission to the Academic University wishing to pass the entrance tests, more detailed information in the <a href="http://mit.spbau.ru/admission_form">rules of admission to the magistracy</a> .  Applicants who have specialized diplomas are interviewed.  The rest pass the exam in computer science and mathematics.  If you have any questions, you can search for answers <a href="http://mit.spbau.ru/faq">here</a> , and if your question is unique, you can ask it via the <a href="http://mit.spbau.ru/contact">feedback form</a> . <br><br>  If you would like to study with us and plan to take part in entrance examinations this year, you need to fill out the form on <a href="http://mit.spbau.ru/">the</a> department <a href="http://mit.spbau.ru/">website</a> .  Completing the form does not oblige to anything, but allows you to receive operational information about the admission, including the date of the preliminary interviews in 2015. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/285764/">https://habr.com/ru/post/285764/</a></p>
