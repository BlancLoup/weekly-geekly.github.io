After a short and slightly sarcastic interview, viewers learned that the 47-year-old woman always practiced being a singer, and today is her chance to prove herself.  The hall whistled and hooted, and the jury looked at her with some pity and sympathy and waited for the performance to begin. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      Watch the video before reading the rest, because  words are superfluous ... <br><br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DRxPZh4AnWyk">www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxPZh4AnWyk</a> <br><br>  - jury comments: <br><br>  ‚ÄúWhen you stood here and said that you wanted to become a singer, everyone was laughing at you.  Nobody laughs anymore.  It was a fascinating ... amazing performance, "- Piers Morgan. <br><br>  "... there was a whole room against you, everyone expected you to fail. I honestly think that we were all cynical, but this song became a‚Äú bell ‚Äùin life. I would like to say that it was an honor to listen to you!", - Amanda Holden <br><br>  <a href="http://www.vesti.ru/doc.html%3Fid%3D275722">www.vesti.ru/doc.html?id=275722</a> <br><br>  An hour after the broadcast, programs about her were known not only in the United Kingdom.  The video with her performance appeared on YouTube.  During the first day this video was watched by 5 million users.  Four days later, the total number of views was over 30 million.  And it continues to look and revise. <br><br>  The army of fans of Suzanne Boyle is growing exponentially, as well as sites on the Internet with her photos, an incredible performance in the program and, most importantly, a biography worthy of film adaptation.  The birth injury, due to which Susan did poorly in school and grew ugly, ridicule of others, death of parents, loneliness, unemployment and at the age of 47 is a triumph for a huge audience. <br><br>  Domains named Susan Boyle appear in different countries, groups are created on social networks, they write to her and in the comments they give to Olympus itself, the latest fashion is T-shirts with her name on her chest.  True, Susan Boyle herself seems to have not yet realized that her dream has come true, she has become a famous singer - at least on the Internet. <br><br>  P.S.  It seems to me that this is a very touching and instructive story in itself, but I don‚Äôt know which section is better to place in ... </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/57629/">https://habr.com/ru/post/57629/</a></p>
