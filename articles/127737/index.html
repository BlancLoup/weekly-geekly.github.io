  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Digest Wanted.VC # 13</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> In the first week of September, we decided to take a small summary of what happened during the existence of <a href="http://wanted.vc/">Wanted.VC</a> .  And the following happened: from April 2011 to September 2011 <s>there was not a single gap;</s> we published information about 137 projects looking for venture capital investments. <br>  This is a lot.  137 projects with teams is a packed conference hall of the Digital October center, where we have another <a href="http://startupweekend.timepad.ru/event/9270/">Startup Weekend</a> this weekend.  These are 137 IT-services, which you, quite possibly, will use or use already.  These are several hundred people who daily find the strength to fight procrastination and refine their local Yandex. <br>  Some of them come themselves, and some we find in the network (including on Habrahabr'e).  Those who have a project that requires investment, but whom we have not yet found, are still urged to get to Wanted.VC and <a href="http://wanted.vc/wanted/">perform some simple manipulations</a> . <br>  And those whose projects are still resting at the idea stage are still called to <a href="http://startupweekend.timepad.ru/event/9270/">Startup Weekend</a> . <br>  Have a good working week. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ee3/d6a/7fe/ee3d6a7fe92f3b9033ae3cab1050ac84.jpg" align="left"><br>  To check how all the coupon sites we wrote about on Wanted.VC, we subscribed to each of them.  As a result, every day we diligently clean up the work mail from a dozen letters with the newsletter, simultaneously assuring ourselves that frameless furniture at half price is not an objective necessity, but just a marketing ploy. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  But I must say that sending out is perhaps the only way for coupon sites to stay afloat in the face of tough competition: traveling through discount services is becoming quite tiresome, so reading mail is an absolute user limit.  <a href="http://krupon.info/">Krupon</a> offered another option, much more obvious and less annoying: just collect offers from all sites on the same page.  And I collected: now the site <a href="http://krupon.info/projects/%3FSHOWALL_1%3D1">lists</a> discounts from 58 different coupon services.  <a href="http://wanted.vc/blog/the-main-disadvantage-of/">+++</a>

Simply, the longer you work, the more people around you who need something from you.  The creators of the ‚ÄúElectronic reception room‚Äù have an idea how to establish communication with minimal damage to personal time and moral health.  <a href="http://wanted.vc/blog/authorized-reception/">+++</a> <a href="http://wanted.vc/blog/authorized-reception/"><br><br></a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bf1/a25/016/bf1a25016e107f988f2e1aa0fc85cad5.png" align="left">  ‚ÄúNightmare by Polaris‚Äù, ‚ÄúRepair of roads for a solid‚Äú two ‚Äù,‚Äú Auto-trash ‚Äù,‚Äú Drug addiction center in the center of Molitovka ‚Äù, etc., etc. These are not the slogans of an advertising agency specializing in anti-advertising, these are attempts by the residents of Nizhny Novgorod to solve human problems all over the world, a kind of popular revolt, but meaningful and sparing. <br>  Instead of pickets and strikes - peaceful online ads collected on one single site <a href="http://imhonn.ru/">IMHONN.RU</a> .  It seems there is something to complain about: red flags <a href="http://imhonn.ru/claimmap">appear on the map of the city</a> literally every minute, denoting the places to which Nizhny Novgorod have complaints.  <a href="http://wanted.vc/blog/vox-populi/">+++</a> <a href="http://wanted.vc/blog/vox-populi/"><br><br></a> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/50c/4ea/4c1/50c4ea4c1fd073b573c02cc140cf6500.jpg" align="left">  The ‚ÄúGuru‚Äù project began as a graduate student work: after four years in the Laboratory of Scientific and Applied Psychology, specializing in various tests, the project author Alexey Mariza decided to make a full-fledged service. <br>  The result is a ‚ÄúGuru‚Äù, a project that allows you to make management decisions and make judgments about performance and decisions.  <a href="http://wanted.vc/blog/human-psychology-through-the-eyes-of-internet-service/">+++</a> <a href="http://wanted.vc/blog/human-psychology-through-the-eyes-of-internet-service/"><br><br></a> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1e8/4c1/819/1e84c18198afcf607ce294813b918c6d.png" align="left">  Did I turn off the iron?  Just turned it off?  And what if not turned off? <br>  The creators of the Gobee project, obviously, asked this question a little more often than the rest of humanity.  In fact, the ‚Äúiron problem‚Äù can have only two solutions: either throw the iron away, or learn to control it from a distance.  Gobee authors chose the second.  <a href="http://wanted.vc/blog/gobee/">+++</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f25/4b9/bf4/f254b9bf4822eb9c5b26352ec6977f11.png" align="left">  As you are currently reading this post on Wanted.VC, most likely you are the author of the project, looking for investments. Or an investor, looking for the author of the project. <br>  Or a third party, closely watching how the authors of the project are looking for investors, and investors - the authors of the projects. <br>  For all three categories, there is another meeting place - <a href="http://sdelki.ru/">Deal.ru</a> service.  Investors, businessmen, and other economically notable personalities also live there.  <a href="http://wanted.vc/blog/deal/">+++</a> <a href="http://wanted.vc/blog/deal/"><br><br></a> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e23/a39/0b8/e23a390b8cd495b45619e4119f4a7a83.png" align="left">  What associations does the word "photographer" cause?  Well, let's say, staged shooting in magazines, reportage shooting, then - wedding photos. <br>  Where to look for such photographers is approximately clear (traditionally, they first ask friends, then the search engine).  Meanwhile, it is far from so obvious exactly where to look for a specialist in retouching or, say, aerial photography. <br>  <a href="http://www.allprophoto.ru/">AllProPhoto</a> service took to collect photographers from various areas on one site.  <a href="http://wanted.vc/blog/%25D1%2584%25D0%25BE%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BF%25D1%258B/">+++</a> <br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/641/3b0/c14/6413b0c1472758e8c02207139f6e8260.jpg" align="left"><br><br>  Recently in one blog the modernized fairy tale about a goldfish was <a href="http://grinevskaya.com/2011/08/07/dolboeby/">published</a> .  Its essence, on the one hand, is that we are too accustomed to everything ready to try to do something on our own.  On the other hand, there is another point: there are so many different sources of information around that, trying to engage even in highly specialized activities, one inevitably experiences panic fear.  What to take, from which side and with what force? <br>  The creators of BP-Start have already thought of everything, have registered and calculated.  Users of the service need only to choose a business plan suitable for their case and begin to implement it.  <a href="http://wanted.vc/blog/%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D1%2588%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5-%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B-%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0-%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D1%2588%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5-%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B/">+++</a> <br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/dac/bbf/974/dacbbf974b68000c383162e6ca05ff0d.png" align="left">  You just recently launched a very successful Internet portal.  Well, let's say, about men's socks - or, following the advice from books about marketing and maximally narrowing the covered area, about men's socks with folk ornaments from CIS countries. <br>  The blog suddenly became popular, attendance quickly passed the mark pleasant for advertisers, and now advertising is asking for you in your cozy blog.  To find out who your audience is (not counting your colleague) and who, therefore, will be your advertisers, you decide to conduct a survey. <br>  And here <a href="http://simpoll.ru/">Simpoll</a> appears.  <a href="http://wanted.vc/blog/%25D0%25BA%25D1%2580%25D1%2583%25D0%25B3-%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2/">+++</a> <br><br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/127737/">https://habr.com/ru/post/127737/</a></p>
