  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Private Delivery Service - import2me</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/643/c49/c6b/643c49c6bafb856fb079065d72628a72.png" align="left"><br>  It's no secret that the cost of imported goods in domestic stores can be several times higher than the cost in stores abroad.  This state of affairs is caused by a number of objective and not very reasons, but the fact remains that imported goods are costly for the domestic consumer. <br><br>  On the other hand, every year there is a growing flow of people traveling abroad for holidays, business trips or business trips.  Some of them travel abroad regularly.  On their trips, they sometimes buy some things for the purpose of resale, but finding a buyer is often difficult for them, and the risk of not selling is high.  Meet these people with potential customers even before the trip helps service import2me.com. <br><br><h5>  How it works </h5><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  At the core of the import2me.com service are two key concepts: offers of delivery (travel) and orders for delivery (orders) of goods. <br>  <b>Trips</b> are offers from people who are going to go on a trip and can (for a specified reward or without it) bring any goods. <br>  <b>Orders</b> are a list of applications for the delivery of certain goods (in most cases from abroad) for a predetermined cost (the total amount, as a rule, consists of the purchase price and the delivery fee). 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      After placing an order / trip, the service provides the ability to automatically select a list of suitable reciprocal trips / orders for making a deal. <br><br><h5>  Benefit </h5><br><br>  Since the cost of the same product in different countries and even cities can vary significantly, delivery by an individual is beneficial to both parties: the traveler receives a reward for delivery, and the product is cheaper to the customer than at a local store. <br><br>  All you need to make money on your vacation or business trip is to simply add a trip to import2me.com, find a person (suitable options will be offered automatically) who need to bring something, and get a reward for delivering the goods. <br><br>  If you want to buy something that is much more expensive here than abroad - you just need to place an order at import2me.com, find a person (suitable options will be offered automatically) who is going to travel and agree on the cost of delivering the goods you need. <br><br><h5>  Users </h5><br><br>  The import2me.com service is primarily aimed at individuals, but it will undoubtedly be interesting for organizations, including shops selling imported goods.  For them, the solution to the problem of the high cost of delivery can be cooperation with people who go abroad on business, but are ready to bring the necessary goods for a certain reward.  Service import2me.com helps to find them! <br><br><h5>  Implementation </h5><br><br>  It took about a month to write the basic functionality.  The service is written entirely in python (django), Postgresql is used as the database.  The load distribution is handled by nginx.  For caching, memcache is used. <br>  The design was done on its own (there is no designer in the team), so we will be happy for any productive comments (and not only on design). <br>  The search is implemented with the help of sphinx, also sphinx is responsible for the selection of counter orders for travel and return trips for ordering. <br>  Now the service is in the stage of active development - there are a number of ideas for improving and expanding the functionality, which are planned to be implemented soon.  Follow us on Twitter for the latest news. <br><br><h5>  Conclusion </h5><br><br>  Constructive criticism is welcomed, various forms of cooperation and mutually beneficial proposals are considered.  It would be very interesting to hear the opinion of the habrovchan both about the idea as a whole and about its implementation. <br><br>  Respectfully, <br>  Team <a href="http://import2me.com/">import2me.com</a> <br><br>  We are in contact: <a href="http://vkontakte.ru/import2me">vkontakte.ru/import2me</a> <br>  We are on twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/import2me">twitter.com/import2me</a> <br>  We are on facebook: <a href="http://www.facebook.com/import2me">www.facebook.com/import2me</a> <br><br>  On Habr√©, on questions in a personal, you can write to the user <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/cod/" class="user_link">cod</a> (preferably;)), or me. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/136956/">https://habr.com/ru/post/136956/</a></p>
