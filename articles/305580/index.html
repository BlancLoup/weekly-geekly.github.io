An important distinctive feature of the acceleration program was the specific acceleration policy of Sberbank, under which at first the projects will receive only expert support from the bank and at the same time a penny of investments.  Sberbank will provide financial support only to projects that were recognized as the best after the acceleration program. <br><br>  And at the end of June, news appeared in the media about a joint project of Sberbank, the Russian Academy of National Economy and the State Service under the President of Russia (RANEPA) - the <a href="http://sber-magistr.ranepa.ru/">master's program</a> in the specialty ‚Äúfinancial technologies‚Äù. <br><br><h4>  Foreign organizations </h4><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/755/1dd/672/7551dd6726d042c8b8493803a7bfd0ab.png"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/489/2c9/136/4892c9136f854357a415927fda6dc9d8.png"><br><br>  Below is a list of accelerators focused on fintech projects that are at an early stage of development. <br><br>  <a href="http://fi.co/">Founder Institute</a> (FI) is an incubator designed for young FINTECH startups, which has established its presence in 45 countries. <br><br>  <a href="http://startupweekend.org/">Startup Weekend</a> is a series of 54-hour events organized with the support of Google for Entrepreneurs.

According to him, the Russian Fintech project can go one of four ways: <br><br><ul><li>  Sell ‚Äã‚Äãthe jar.  An important criterion here is the presence of a FINTECH startup really valuable technology for the bank. </li><li>  Find buyers of their services from the players of the banking market.  Such services may include, for example, analyzing the preferences of bank customers, organizing loyalty programs between banks and retail customers, exporting data from banks for online scoring, and countering fraud. </li><li>  Solve business problems of a single bank.  For example, Rocketbank, working in the interests of Otkritie Bank. </li><li>  Get support from the bank.  A typical example of this is the above-mentioned acceleration programs organized by banks and financial companies. </li></ul><br>  The accelerated infrastructure, partially formed and continuing to develop around the world, indicates that any fintech project that has the potential and is capable of solving problems of its users in a quality manner is available all the necessary tools for growth throughout the world. <br><br>  <i>Continue to follow the materials that are specially prepared for you by <a href="http://payonline.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr%26utm_medium%3Dreferral%26utm_campaign%3Dwebpayments-main">PayOnline</a> specialists, and stay up to date with global trends in the development of FINTECH start-ups.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/305580/">https://habr.com/ru/post/305580/</a></p>
