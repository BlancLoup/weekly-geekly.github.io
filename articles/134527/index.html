What's new? <br><br>  We in Minsk the other day (December 10) was <strong><a href="http://startit.by/">Belarus Startup 2011</a></strong> .  This time the competition was not limited to the capital, but also captured startups from the regions.  There were two stages: from November to December everyone could submit applications that were considered by a high commission, and the best of the best passed to the finals, and then in the final they chose the best in their nominations and the best project of all presented. <br><br> <a href="http://startit.by/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/3a06b898/96de6eac/41bbbc4a/ce72a607.jpg"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  What happened next? </h4><br>  Since there is still no complete report on the last event (I hope that so far) - unless, of course, a small photo report on <a href="">Online</a> is <a href="">taken</a> into <a href="">account</a> - I will tell about everything myself.

      There were three nominations ( <strong>scientific</strong> , <strong>web</strong> and <strong>game start-ups</strong> ), each with three finalist projects.  Since from the very beginning it was known that <br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúIn the final of 2011, the best project in the opinion of the Expert Council will be a free 4-month pre-investment preparation in a business incubator and in the spring of 2012 will go on an internship in Silicon Valley USA‚Äù, <br></blockquote>  The guys tried to show the best that they have.  Or wanted to try. <br><br><br><br><h4>  SCIENTIFIC STARTUP </h4><br>  Unfortunately, I missed the scientific section, so it would be great if there was someone on Habr√© who saw the presentations and tells us about them.  Here are the three finalists: <br><ul><li>  Alexander Kukh with <strong>"Heat energy converter"</strong> </li><li>  Dmitry Odinets and his <strong>"Parallel processor"</strong> </li><li>  Artyom Semenenko and <strong>"Evaluation of building structures"</strong> (winner) </li></ul><br><br><h4>  GAMEDEV STARTUP </h4><br>  The following were game developers, two of whom have already become regulars of Belarusian startup events: <br><ul><li>  Egor Kuryanovich once again showed <strong>‚Äú <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DtyIAJ6Aon0E">FAR7</a> ‚Äù</strong> , told about the themebox (this is like sandbox and themepark right away), interactive space and promised to soon open testing. </li><li>  Nikita Velmaskin again told about <strong>‚ÄúPocketGame‚Äù</strong> - his adaptation of the PocketFallout engine for mobile platforms, on which you can make games almost without programming or writing scripts using a special dialect of BASIC. </li><li>  Kirill Gorenitsyn, the winner of the nomination and the whole Belarus Startup 2011, blinded everyone to <strong>‚Äú <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DcCc_TZHgD5Q">Far Galaxy Ocean</a> ‚Äù</strong> - a demo version of the game for the iPad, where the brave dolphin will have to collect eggs and dive into the pipe to get to the next level. </li></ul><br><br><h4>  WEB STARTUP </h4><br>  We closed the procession of web-startups: <br><ul><li>  Artem Fedenko suggested making an <strong>‚ÄúE-Ticket‚Äù</strong> - a system through which it will be possible to buy tickets for various events remotely and not print them. </li><li>  Alexander Kulitsky came up with the idea of <strong>‚Äúrefeed.me‚Äù</strong> and won, because he proposed an application that can ‚Äúlike‚Äù only part of the content of a post, page, site, etc. </li><li>  Philip Daineko presented the concept of <strong>‚ÄúGreat Work‚Äù</strong> , a service of life mentors, which will be integrated into a social network, and where lost people will be able to get advice or instruction, and those who have found themselves will be given this advice or instruction. </li></ul><br><br><h4>  At last </h4><br>  After the start-ups of the finalists, a flash pitch began, where everyone from the audience could go to the microphone and present their project within 60 seconds.  Speakers and projects, there were about a dozen, voted for the audience who liked everything.  As a result, the guy won - sorry, I did not remember the name - who demonstrated the backpack column and offered an interesting system for illuminating the car disks. <br><br>  Apart from the main prize - internships in California - the winners were awarded books on the relevant topics, provided jobs in the <a href="http://www.incubator.informatics.by/">incubator</a> , and were morally encouraged to do better, more and, in general, lean more on startups. <br><br>  In parallel with the main program, an amateur video about startups was held.  Videos of the contestants, as well as voting for the best of them can be observed in the <a href="http://vkontakte.ru/itstart">group of the event</a> . <br><br>  PS Links were listed only on those presentations that I was able to find.  If you have any additional information about the participating projects or about the event itself, let's discuss it in the comments to this post. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/134527/">https://habr.com/ru/post/134527/</a></p>
