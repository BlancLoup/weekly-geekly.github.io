Get acquainted now with the Bitcoin family: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/959/fa3/984/959fa398401f464a8cd012c8f9957bc7.jpg"><br>  <i>When Joshua Redman‚Äôs six-year-old son Joshua gets a tooth, he finds a piece of paper with a QR code under his pillow, which means that coins have been added to his bitcoin wallet</i> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  This is just one of the curious features of the amazing life of the Redman family, which is closely related to cryptocurrencies, as Jamie <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/buzz/we-are-bitcoin-family">argues</a> in his article entitled ‚ÄúWe are a Bitcoin family‚Äù.  In this post, he describes in detail how Bitcoin permeates the entire living space of their family, consisting of Jamie himself, his wife Lisa and two sons - six-year-old Joshua and two-year-old Franklin, ranging from paying bills to homeschooling of children.  Jamie, a former builder and now bitcoin-blogger, bitcoin-artist and journalist (who pays bitcoins), teaches his children himself and tells them about the bizarre world of crypto-finance. <br><br><blockquote>  We live in the world of Bitcoin 24 hours a day.  It looks like a continuous blockchain.  For my family, bitcoin really means a lot. </blockquote><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c44/c3e/07e/c44c3e07e013464a851e6d2578065f73.jpg">

      Strange as it may sound, but while most adults can hardly connect a couple of words, answering the question ‚Äúwhat is bitcoin?‚Äù Joshua, who, as we remember, six, answers this: bitcoin is a cryptocurrency.  This is such computer money that you can pay on the Internet.  Such numbers, for which someone can buy.  As they say, through the mouth of a child. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d6f/aab/06d/d6faab06d08d44389be70dfe23189fda.jpg"><br>  <i>The son of Jamie Joshua holds a bitcoin wallet in his hands.</i> <br><br>  According to Jamie, he first heard about Bitcoin in 2011, but was not a big fan of this cryptocurrency until 2012. <br><blockquote>  I persuaded my wife to buy a few coins as an investment, I wanted to try to trade on the stock exchange and began to read literature about cryptocurrencies.  But I got so carried away that at first I only said that about Bitcoin, I constantly drew sketches about Bitcoin, it inspired me. </blockquote><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3b4/c69/a4d/3b4c69a4d51844fd8bd05d1f635fcfde.jpg"><br><br><blockquote>  At first, my wife did not share my hobbies, she could not explain to her acquaintances what kind of money it was, but now she‚Äôs just as good as me, she appreciated the real possibilities of this currency and believed in her.  Joshua didn‚Äôt immediately understand me either, once we went to a Bitcoin ATM (of which in Boston 4), he was 4 years old, and he expected to see ‚Äúreal Bitcoins,‚Äù that is, coins, but this did not happen. </blockquote><br>  But Joshua enthusiastically perceived the appearance of the Trezor wallet in the family - now he knows exactly where his coins are kept. <br><br><blockquote>  When people ask me what I do, I respond like this: ‚ÄúI write about bitcoin every day.  The first is that, as a rule, everyone is interested in - do I get paid for it? ‚ÄùSays Jamie,‚Äú Yes, I get paid in bitcoin.  There usually have to go into explanations, show the wallet on your smartphone and graphics on the Internet.  Financial technology has evolved greatly, but even the fact that you can pay most bills from your wallet in your smartphone still makes a strong impression on many. </blockquote><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/15f/896/12c/15f89612cb7a47e8bb609ac69bbbb8a5.jpg"><br>  One of Jamie's paintings: <a href="http://www.crypto-graphics.com/graphics.html">Crypto-graphics.com</a> <br><br>  Jamie is often asked what to do if, for example, friends are invited to a restaurant that does not accept bitcoins. <br><br><blockquote>  Everything is not so difficult, we still pay some of our bills in Fiat, for this we use the <a href="https://bitpay.com/">BitPay</a> service.  So, I don‚Äôt give up on fiats at all, but I try not to resort to them whenever possible. </blockquote><br>  In addition, there are several good restaurants in Boston that accept bitcoins. <br><br>  Jamie identifies himself as an agorist, supporter of the concept of Samuel Konkin, who has as his ultimate goal the achievement of a <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A1%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25B9_%25D1%2580%25D1%258B%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BA">free market</a> society in which all relationships between people are built on voluntary exchanges.  He believes that when choosing a currency, we would choose the model of the world order to which we aspire, and he is not inclined to categorize ‚Äúvote for dollars‚Äù. <br><br><blockquote>  We use bitcoins every day for everyday and major purchases.  If we are going to the vegetable shop, we <a href="https://www.gyft.com/bitcoin/">stock up on Gyft cards</a> , which accept payments in the Whole Foods Market.  Gyft cards are a great alternative, sometimes for their use you can get 10-15% discount, <br>  - Jamie writes in his blog. </blockquote><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/286/549/e27/286549e27ee84b8ab5976804d7f8bd8e.jpg"><br><br><blockquote>  I tell children a lot about bitcoin, my son and I sometimes draw pictures about bitcoins together.  In their home school there are lessons on crypto-finance.  We often discuss the stories I write, I talk about crypto enthusiasts from around the world whom I have had to interview.  Sometimes we consider graphs of changes in the value of Bitcoin and I have to explain what green and red candles mean.  For some reason, these graphics are very interested. </blockquote><br>  Jamie believes that their lifestyle has a great future: <br><br><blockquote>  So far we are somewhere in the middle of the road, half of our family budget exists in bitcoins, so we have to follow the courses.  At some moments, our purchasing power grew, then fell, but my fees are calculated in dollars and paid in bitcoins at the current rate, and the money in a family of four does not stay long, so the overall depreciation over the last year didn‚Äôt hurt us much .  However, I can read and follow the charts as much as I want, but I cannot predict the future even for the next year.  So, in a certain sense, a full transition to bitcoins is a leap into the unknown.  For now, I can only believe that the possibilities of Bitcoin will be appreciated - over time.  I constantly meet talented innovators and developers who are also burning with crypto-ideas like me.  I see what they create, and these projects live and change our reality.  A few years ago, no one could have imagined that an Internet access point could be worn on his belt, but this is so.  Now many do not believe in cryptocurrency, but every year there will be less and less of such people. </blockquote><br>  <i>Bitcoin may well become a way of life.</i>  <i>And we in <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/hashflare/blog/">HashFlare</a> just help them to mine.</i> <br><br> <a href="https://hashflare.io/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3D262888"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1dd/367/7aa/1dd3677aafe64a1e888d52478bfea613.png"></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/368467/">https://habr.com/ru/post/368467/</a></p>
