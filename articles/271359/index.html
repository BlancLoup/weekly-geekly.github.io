      <i>Translator's note: and Habr is <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/198816/">no exception</a> .</i> <br><br>  After this, you ask yourself a question - have I chosen a bad language? <br><br><h2>  Everything is written in PHP </h2><br>  Maybe you will even begin to doubt yourself because you have put on the wrong horse.  After all, everyone seems to like Clojure, Haskell and JavaScript, but no one is PHP. <br><br>  Let's look on the Internet, what projects still use PHP: <br><ul><li>  Facebook </li><li>  Wordpress </li><li>  Yahoo </li><li>  Wikipedia </li><li>  4chan </li></ul><br>  A large proportion of the largest sites in the world are written in PHP.  It seems certain that PHP is a worthy and practical language for creating web applications, but we are distracted. <br><br><h2>  Now is not 2004 </h2><br>  A lot of criticism of PHP is based on things that were not in the language when the critic was last looking at him - at the beginning of zero. <br><br>  Today in PHP there are classes and normal OOP.  There are great frameworks, such as <a href="http://laravel.com/">Laravel</a> and <a href="http://symfony.com/">Symfony</a> . <br><br>  PHP has <a href="https://getcomposer.org/">a package manager</a> that works with a <a href="https://packagist.org/">huge archive of</a> open source packages. <br><br>  PHP has great testing frameworks: for example, <a href="https://phpunit.de/">PHPUnit</a> for unit testing, <a href="http://docs.behat.org/en/v2.5/">Behat</a> and <a href="http://codeception.com/">Codeception</a> for BDD. <br><br>  Some complaints in the aforementioned articles are well founded.  There are inconsistencies in the language, and, of course, there are languages ‚Äã‚Äãin which there are fewer problems, but PHP looks like nothing, if you take into account its age, flexibility, and why it <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/phps-creator-rasmus-lerdorf/">was created</a> . <br><br><h2>  How does this affect developers </h2><br>  It's a shame when you are not taken seriously as a developer, despite working in serious projects.  Such an attitude seriously harms the community. <br><br>  It often seems that PHP developers are locked in closed micro-communities.  Due to the fact that in larger communities they are not welcomed, they often organize their own meetings, user groups and conferences. <br><br><h2>  Funny story </h2><br>  Sometimes this constant conviction really exhausts me.  Even though I know that PHP is a great language, I often think about quitting writing on it, if only I don‚Äôt have to deal with prejudices anymore. <br><br>  When I was younger, I looked weird: with painted dreadlocks, with piercings on my face and in patched clothes.  I really liked that look, but it was terribly tiring. <br><br>  Everywhere ‚Äî during college classes, at the intern interview, when I started my own company ‚Äî my appearance was a constant distraction.  At best, they told me that for someone who ‚Äúlooks like this,‚Äù I am ‚Äúsurprisingly professional.‚Äù <br><br>  10 years have passed, but the problem is the same - it only distracts the other.  "You are surprisingly well aware of computer science for a PHP developer."  Fu <br><br>  Unfortunately, I see no progress in solving this problem.  Often people complain about PHP simply because it is fashionable.  But, unfortunately, there is no end in sight. <br><br>  It is very sad.  We found ourselves in a chicken-egg situation: if PHP developers are constantly humiliated, they will leave the community, and there will be fewer and fewer good PHP programmers in it. <br><br>  <i>The article was translated specifically for the corporate blog Web-payment.ru - a project that will help you connect to the site <a href="http://web-payment.ru/priem-platezhej/">accepting payments</a> or mass payments.</i>  <i>Contact us!</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/271359/">https://habr.com/ru/post/271359/</a></p>
