  <section class="page js-page"><h1>And a little more about the Fujitsu World Tour</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <b>Hi Habr!</b>  In our previous <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/fujitsu/blog/308474/">post,</a> we already talked about Russian projects that will be presented at the <b>Fujitsu World Tour 2016</b> : creating the largest storage system in Russia (in terms of memory) for the petrochemical cluster of the Republic of Bashkortostan and building an integrated infrastructure for the Samara Medical Center Heart Clinic.  In addition, we look forward to the presentation of international expert Daniel Thorniley, president of DT-Global Business Consulting GmbH.  In this article, we will touch on other projects that Fujitsu customers will tell you about - the Safe City in Chita, the modernization of the IT infrastructure of Yulmart, and also talk about what <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/fujitsu/blog/215479/">Fujitsu GDC Russia</a> is doing and what <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/fujitsu/blog/235793/">Retail solutions</a> Fujitsu produces .  All interested please under the cat.  <a href="http://www.fujitsu.com/ru/microsites/worldtour2016/registration/index.html">Registration for the conference is</a> open until September 16! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6f5/34a/e63/6f534ae63a1b4866bc656cdffb3b7e29.JPG"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Let's start with the projects.  Most recently, a joint project was completed with Rostelecom PJSC (with the participation of a partner, AT Consulting) - building an IT infrastructure to ensure the operation of the Safe City system.  It includes video surveillance in public places and outdoor cameras, as well as an analytics system based on the captured video of incidents in the city (accidents, fires, etc.), which in real time processes a huge stream of data from the cameras and provides an analytical A report with recommendations for preventing emergencies.  To provide systems with computing resources in Chita, 2 geographically distributed data centers were built based on Fujitsu servers and data storage systems: several dozen servers and 2 ETERNUS storage systems per site.  Storage capacity for video storage - about 2 petabytes each.  All applications that record, edit video and analytics are in a virtual environment, the video is processed in an automated mode, and an analytical report is created.  The project in Chita was launched at the end of last year, and at the beginning of 2016 it was fully commissioned. <br><br>  Another major project that we will discuss at the conference is the creation of an integrated IT infrastructure for Yulmart, the leader of Russian e-commerce.  The project of migration to PRIMERGY servers and Fujitsu ETERNUS storage systems began in 2010, and by now the vast majority of systems - ERP, 1C SCP, website, and so on.  operates on Fujitsu hardware.  Now there are 3 independent data centers and dozens of stores throughout Russia.  The peculiarity of the project is that initially Yulmart purchased Fujitsu equipment for the implementation of the SAP ERP system, but after evaluating the quality and usability of working with Fujitsu, he decided to switch completely to systems from one vendor, which gives serious advantages.  When switching to a new generation of Fujitsu servers and storage systems, the continuity of the architecture is preserved and, having learned to work with this equipment once, there are almost no further problems.  In addition, since Ulmart has an SAP software infrastructure, an additional advantage is the expertise of the company.  Fujitsu works with SAP directly - one of the first SAP installations occurred on Fujitsu servers.

The center provides infrastructure management services, applications, Service Desk and workplace support services, as well as administration of various Cloud platforms (including Fujitsu K5 &amp; MetaArc, which can also be learned at the event).  The conference will feature Ruslan Vagizov, executive director of Fujitsu GDC Russia and Alexey Shipov, project manager for cloud technologies.  They will present a Russian project developed by GDC - a hybrid private cloud on the infrastructure of OpenStack.  The basis was the Japanese Fujitsu K5 cloud platform methodology and a new interface and procedures were written on its basis.  Throughout the exhibition, Fujitsu GDC Russia will demonstrate several Fujitsu solutions - the workplace of the future (integration of Windows 10, Office 365, Azure, Intune, etc.) and the package of software management services Application Packaging - preparing software packages for deploying them to work places. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/274/97d/2b2/27497d2b29354a87a67035953507f346.jpg"></div><br><br>  <i>Application Packaging management software services provided by Fujitsu GDC</i> <br><br>  We want to tell you what GDC is, and why we believe that the future lies with them.  Given the low ruble exchange rate, Fujitsu GDC Russia services are becoming more profitable than their foreign counterparts.  GDC Russia has not only foreign customers, but also several large Russian clients.  It is safe to say that Russian customers have already ‚Äútasted‚Äù IT services from professional service providers, and there is a gradual increase in the order book. <br><br>  A separate session of the conference will be devoted to examples of projects with retailers that use Fujitsu trading equipment (self-service cash registers and POS terminals).  These include the trading network AUCHAN, Children's World, Leroy Merlin, Myasnov / Relax and others.  In the Russian market, the Fujitsu portfolio for retailers is the most extensive, it includes about 80% of the equipment needed to deploy the infrastructure of a trading enterprise. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c90/3ba/2c0/c903ba2c05b94a269f2a4672cee6cbae.JPG"><br><br>  The Fujitsu World Tour conference is not only a major annual event in the IT sector, but also an excellent platform for exchanging experience and immersing in the world of innovations used in Russian projects for building IT systems.  Register and come, it will be useful and interesting! <br><br>  Detailed information and the program are available on the conference website: <a href="http://www.fujitsu.ru/worldtour">www.fujitsu.ru/worldtour</a> <br>  Registration - <a href="http://www.fujitsu.com/ru/microsites/worldtour2016/registration/index.html">www.fujitsu.com/ru/microsites/worldtour2016/registration/index.html</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/309224/">https://habr.com/ru/post/309224/</a></p>
