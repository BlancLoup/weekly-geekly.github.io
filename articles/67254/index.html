      <b>06/02/2009</b> <a href="http://www.securitylab.ru/news/380707.php">‚ÄúPirate Party‚Äù claims for seats in the European Parliament.</a>  On June 7, elections to the European Parliament will take place. <a name="habracut"></a>  ‚ÄúPirate Party‚Äù, advocating for free file sharing, can claim one seat in the European Parliament.  Elections to the European Parliament are held every 5 years in all EU countries.  From 2009 to 2014  The European Parliament will have 736 delegates.  Sweden will be represented in the European Parliament by 18 delegates.  In order to get into parliament, the Pirate Party will need to get a little more than 5 percent of the total number of votes.  ‚ÄúThe Pirate Party‚Äù is not the first time participating in the elections to the European Parliament, in 2006 she managed to get only 0.63% of the vote in Sweden.  <b>After the trial of the creators of The Pirate Bay, the number of party members has grown</b> to 46,000 people.  The batch program includes the following items: <b>free file sharing between Internet users, reducing the cost of licensed discs, elimination of patent law, prohibition of DRM systems</b> . <br><br>  Thus, the process for the Pirate Bay was the impetus for the growth of the Pirate Party.  "And it is right". <br><br>  <b>06/08/2009</b> <a href="http://www.securitylab.ru/news/380976.php">‚ÄúPirate Party‚Äù got into the European Parliament The</a> Swedish ‚ÄúPirate Party‚Äù managed to win a seat in the future composition of the European Parliament, in the elections held on Sunday, <b>gaining 7.4% of the vote</b> .  Supporters of this party are in favor of free distribution of intellectual property on the Internet.  In the 18-30 age group, the so-called ‚Äúintellectual pirates‚Äù enjoy the support of 19% of voters.  The main requirements of the party are the freedom to share files over the Internet, lower prices for CDs, the abolition of patent rights and the prohibition of restrictions on copying files at home.  ‚ÄúPirate Party‚Äù was founded in 2006 and this year received 0.63% of the vote in the elections to the Swedish parliament.  One of the party‚Äôs policy documents states: ‚ÄúIt is important to preserve the right to privacy and the right to communicate through free e-mail, telephone and mail.  On the Internet, you need to feel secure.  Therefore, the state should not infringe upon the rights and prey on an entire generation. ‚Äù <br><br>  And rushed: <br><br>  <b>06/23/2009 The</b> <a href="http://www.securitylab.ru/news/381750.php">Pirate Party of Germany gained a place in the Bundestag</a> J√∂rg Tauss, a prominent German politician, member of parliament, recently decided to leave the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) and join the Pirate Party because of disagreement with the parliamentary majority on Internet censorship .  J√∂rg Tauss, a famous German politician, a member of parliament, recently decided to leave the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) and join the Pirate Party because of disagreement with the parliamentary majority on censorship <br><br>  <b>06/29/2009</b> <a href="http://www.securitylab.ru/news/381964.php">Pirate parties appeared in France, the Czech Republic and Estonia.</a> French legislation provides fertile ground for the prosperity of such a party.  Recall that the authorities have approved a very tough "law of three blows", which implies a complete disconnection of violators of the "copyright" from the global network.  Currently, the group has about 1,600 members on Facebook.  ‚ÄúOne of the key points of our political program is to carry out a reform of copyright legislation, following which the inhabitants of the global network will be provided with comprehensive access to cultural values,‚Äù says the leader of the French pirates Remi Seresiani (R√©my C√©r√©siani). <br><br>  Please note that in France the creation of the Pirate Party was a forced act of self-defense of thinking people against the copyrights, supported by the full power of the law and the police apparatus. <br><br>  <b>07/06/2009</b> <a href="http://www.securitylab.ru/news/382202.php">Pirate Party will participate in the elections to the German Parliament The</a> Pirate Party of Germany (Piratenpartei Deutschland) at the first party congress, held July 4-5 in Hamburg, decided to participate in the elections to the Bundestag, scheduled for September 27, reports ddp.  Representatives of the Pirate Party say they are hoping to overcome the necessary five percent barrier, but they note that even two or three percent will be ‚Äúabsolute success‚Äù for them.  The optimism of the "pirates" supports the sharp increase in party members, the number of which, as reported on the official website of the BCP, has quadrupled in recent weeks.  In the January 2009 land elections in Hesse, the Pirate Party received 0.5 percent, and in the elections to the European Parliament 0.9 percent voted for it ( <b>224,840 voters</b> ). <br>  At the first party congress, a new party chairman was elected - he was a 40-year-old physicist from Munster Jens Seipenbusch - and also approved the party's electoral program.  The main thing for members of the GTS is the <b>protection of the fundamental rights of citizens in the digital age and the fight against the state of total surveillance.</b>  <b>Among other things, this involves giving citizens complete control over the use of their personal data, the removal of software patents and the weakening of copyright laws, which, according to ‚Äúpirates,‚Äù <u>hamper the development of science and society.</u></b> <br><br>  <b>August 13, 2009 The</b> <a href="http://www.securitylab.ru/news/383606.php">Pirate Party of Great Britain is officially listed in the register of political organizations.</a>  The party can now nominate its candidates for the next general election. <br>  The pirate party is fighting for the legalization of file sharing on the Internet, protecting the rights of the user of the Network, as well as the reform of copyright, restricting the distribution of music and movies.  The party leader, Andrew Peter Robinson, called on the British to make donations to promote "pirated" ideas, as well as to join the party. <br>  Recall that the pirate political movement originated in Sweden in 2006 <br><br>  <a href="http://www.securitylab.ru/news/tags/%25CF%25E8%25F0%25E0%25F2%25F1%25EA%25E0%25FF%2B%25EF%25E0%25F0%25F2%25E8%25FF/">Pruflink</a> . <br><br>  Well, what about us?  Where is the Pirate Party of Russia, strong and creative?  Is it time to fight for your interests?  Al, we are not imprisoned for copying Adobe? <br><br>  Everyone will wait until they come personally for him? <br><br>  Update: <br>  September 19, 2006 <a href="http://www.securitylab.ru/news/274062.php">Pirate Party Created in Russia</a> <br>  pirateparty.ru - see comments.  Thanks to all who commented. <br><br>  Update 2: since each of my explanatory comments leads to the fact that my karma decreases, I, perhaps, can no longer answer. <br><br>  If you understand what is written here - please throw in karma.  In the minus there are drawbacks. <br><br>  If you do not understand what is written here, then: <br>  Read carefully highlighted in bold.  Ask yourself: is there a word ‚Äúfreebie‚Äù in the highlighted?  Do you personally, personally, in your experience, DRM? <br>  Please find out the difference between a software patent and a software license.  See what the patents are about.  (For example, about 25% of the human genome is patented. A wheel is patented in Australia. Using this information violates someone's patent ... If we believe that the existing patent system is perfect). <br><br>  My predictions please consider my personal matter.  For example, fiction and cyberpunk. <br><br>  It is somehow unpleasant to write on Habr after all this.  What exactly are you minusuyte for?  For the fact that Windows Vista does not go to ARM?  For what chrome linux kernel is?  So this is not my fault. <br><br><habracut></habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/67254/">https://habr.com/ru/post/67254/</a></p>
