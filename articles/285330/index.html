  <section class="page js-page"><h1>About stressful interviews</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Some time ago on Habr√© an article appeared <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/hr/85886/">The most terrible interview in my life</a> , in which I was told about the concept of stressful interview.  I wanted to collect more information about him for full coverage of the issue. <br><img align="right" src="http://img694.imageshack.us/img694/4369/interviewstress.jpg" alt="image"><br>  A stressful interview is an interview in which a candidate is attempted to be off-balance, put in a situation when he feels uncomfortable or simply does something that the applicant is not ready for. <br><br>  An experiment was conducted a few years ago - to people who thought they were being interviewed for a top management position, a recruiter suddenly splashed out a glass of water in his face.  This experiment was so famous that now the reception "a glass of water in the face" is mentioned as one of the first when talking about stressful interviews. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  The reactions were varied - someone wiped himself and continued the conversation, someone left in shock, others gave the change - in return they threw something at the recruiter.  One man showed excellent response by dodging (then left the room).  The insecurity of the experiment manifested itself in the fact that one girl, while the water was still in flight, managed to snatch a chair from under her and try to hit the insulted person, in this case the recruiter had already shown agility - if he had not had time to dodge, he would not do without medicine.  (unfortunately, I could not find the video program in which this experiment was shown)

      It is believed that a stressful interview is useful when interviewing a person who in the future in the process of work will have to deal with stress.  In my opinion, this is not so - this method, as can be seen from the experiment, removes the mask from a person and shows his real qualities, which allows one to more accurately judge whether he is suitable for a certain position or not.  For example, a manager needs aggressiveness, and a public relations officer needs slyness and tolerance. <br><br>  Now such interviewing methods (not so tough, of course) are used in the IT field.  For example, I know a person who faced elements of pressure during an interview for the position of Analyst. <br><br>  So, what can wait habrrvchanina. <br><img src="http://i056.radikal.ru/1003/44/6504497f8c18.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  1. Everything will start before you enter </h4>  A common version of the introduction to stress - to marinate a person in anticipation of the interview.  In this case, it is worthwhile to estimate for yourself in advance how much waiting this job is worth and sit out this time.  You can stock up on a book. <br><br><h4>  2. Filling out the questionnaire in uncomfortable conditions. </h4>  This reception was even mentioned in the People in Black, as well as the way out of the situation - make yourself comfortable (who does not remember - <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DviUfFqdEPhU">here</a> from the fourth minute starting) <br><br><h4>  3. The interview may be held in an uncomfortable room. </h4>  - too bright or dark, stuffy / cold, smoky, etc. This simply needs to be ready. <br><br><h4>  4. Unequal forces. </h4>  The interview can be conducted in such a way that there are many applicants or vice versa, the employer‚Äôs representatives, while one sits opposite you, leans towards you and at first represents a lot of interest.  The other one sits in such a way that it was uncomfortable to look at him (from behind or from the side), and they tell you that this is a very important person and you must certainly impress him.  The third is also located somewhere behind as an observer.  This situation, when the ‚Äúbig brother‚Äù sees you, and you do not see those who are looking at you can be solved by turning the chair to see all the interlocutors. <br>  Sitting opposite the "interested" also does not make a pleasant impression.  He deliberately does not use in communication the so-called connection technique.  In ordinary life, we mirror each other's gestures and poses, and in this case your interlocutor intentionally moves away, turns away from you, responds to your smile with a cold look. <br><br><h4>  5. In the process of the interview </h4>  unexpected questions may be asked, the pacemaker, tone and enthusiasm of the recruiter for conversation will change dramatically - that is, he may just think, distract himself, or make a call to someone. <br><img src="http://i069.radikal.ru/1003/30/b621c7990726.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Topics may be affected: <br>  - The shortcomings of the applicant, which are immediately discussed, criticized and ridiculed; <br>  - Reasons for leaving a previous job. <br>  - Interest in the personal life of the candidate.  And by the moments, perhaps, not having a connection with the work and quite intimate.  One woman, for example, was asked questions: ‚ÄúYou have two children, while you worked without interruption.  Have you come to work when the child was very small?  I do not like women who abandon their children!  Why do you need a second child?  Was he born in a second marriage?  So you also have a problem with men!  Some women think that you can keep a man with the help of a child.  Naive, right? ‚Äù <br><br>  And in a certain company, all applicants were asked on an interview (naturally, fake) to have a plastic surgery paid for by the company - this was how the depth of loyalty of the applicant was checked :). <br><br><h4>  6. Among the insane approaches are also: </h4>  (although it is more for managers and managers) The option was to place the candidate in ‚Äúreal field conditions‚Äù, when HR disguised as a client (angry, as a rule) burst into the office where the interview was held and, addressing anyone, engaging those present in the conflict.  Much depended on the applicant's reaction: on the one hand, he is not yet an employee, cannot intervene, but on the other hand, the scandal within the walls of a reputable company is not the best indicator, other customers will react to this, therefore it is necessary to smooth it out with possible means. <br>  An applicant who is not indifferent to the company in which he intends to work and who sets out on the path to resolving a conflict with an unknown hooligan client is precisely this indicator, along with others, was evaluated when making a decision. <br><br><h4>  7. And of course, the good old "good and evil police." </h4>  For example, the evil in every possible way puts pressure on the interviewee, while the good at this moment suggests thinking about positions that are more worthy of a candidate like him. <br><br>  Total, universal recipe - be calm and polite.  You can make concessions or not, but politeness, even gloomy, should not leave you.  Remember, you can complete everything at any time - just say goodbye to a tactless or rude interviewer. <br><img src="http://s61.radikal.ru/i174/1003/1d/769b9090ab90.jpg" alt="image"><br>  By and large, the methods for selecting personnel characterize the company in which to work.  And the applicant, in turn, may wonder if he needs it?  So stressful interview gives important information not only to the employer, but also to the applicant. <br>  And finally, the video.  Playing, but the essence reflects well. <br><br><iframe src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http://player.vimeo.com/9436225&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700043,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhj65WBvfD1O4-b9agCJnF5SJOIxSA" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" title="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/285330/">https://habr.com/ru/post/285330/</a></p>
