  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Why do startups need a good "felling"?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <b>This year, for the first time, a new startup competition <a href="https://angel.co/europe-venture-summit-2013-startup-competition/apply">Startup Competition</a> will take place in Kiev.</b>  <b>The battle of projects will be held at the <a href="http://venturesummit.eu/">Startup Addventure (Europe Venture Summit)</a> conference.</b>  <b>The peculiarity of this startup fair will be one prize place and an unprecedentedly large cash prize for Ukraine.</b>  <b>In this post, we have pointed out several main reasons why startups from Europe and the CIS should take part in the competition.</b> <br><br>  Startup Competition will be held in Kiev in the NSC "Olympic" on December 4-5 of this year.  Participants who pass the qualifying stage will have the opportunity to write their projects to venture capital investors from around the world.  The conference will be attended by real rock stars of the industry.  In particular, the founder and managing partner of the largest venture seed fund and one of the largest startup accelerators in the US is <a href="http://500.co/">500 Startups</a> <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/davemcclure">Dave McClure (Dave McClure)</a> , whose assets include investments in more than 500 companies.  As well as the founder of the world's largest networked startup incubator <a href="http://fi.co/">The Founder Institute</a> <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/adeoressi">Adeo Ressi</a> , the creator of startups worth $ 2 billion. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8f6/2b1/d4f/8f62b1d4f0caa254fc1344a6991f6b90.jpg" alt="image"><br>  The finalists will present their projects on the stage in front of venture capital investors on December 5th.  The main prize of the competition will be ‚Ç¨ 25,000. The only winner of the <a href="https://angel.co/europe-venture-summit-2013-startup-competition/apply">Startup Competition</a> will receive the entire prize amount.  This is a very important argument in favor of participation in the competition, as often when holding ‚Äústart-battles‚Äù the prize fund is dispersed, that is, it is divided into at least three winners.  As a result, the received funds do not have a tangible effect on the development of the project.  It is clear that in the case of <a href="https://angel.co/europe-venture-summit-2013-startup-competition/apply">Startup Competition there</a> will be only one winner, that is, the participants have less chances to win than in the usual competition format.  But the winner will have the opportunity to support the project financially for at least six months and also invest in its development. <br><br>  Start-up money, including those received at the competition, can be a key factor in the popularity, development and future success of a startup.  But winning it can give the project more critical drive.  ‚ÄúVictories in any nominations are, first of all, an excellent motivation for the team, and then - money for development.  All that is needed for victory is the confidence that the product is ‚Äúproduced‚Äù.  That is what jury and experts appreciate.  Such confidence comes only when everything goes on increasing - customers, development and, of course, the mood within the team.  After we receive a recent grant from the <a href="http://gtf-fund.com/">GTF</a> foundation, part of the team will receive a salary on time for 6 months, which is now extremely important for the project, ‚Äùsays the founder and CEO of the <a href="http://happyfarm.com.ua/startups/residents/hashtago/">HASHTAGO</a> project <a href="http://happyfarm.com.ua/startups/residents/hashtago/">,</a> Andrey Litvin.

      In addition, the winners and even the participants of the competition will get a good opportunity to light up for free in the world's leading specialized media.  ‚ÄúIt was after participating in LOGIN contests in Vilnius, Seedcamp Kiev, iForum that investors noticed us.  We held 2-3 meetings with them a week.  We arrived in Moscow, visited 4 investment companies in one day.  As a result, they received an offer of $ 300 thousand, ‚Äùsays Stas Matvienko, founder and CEO of Ukrainian startup <a href="http://happyfarm.com.ua/startups/residents/advicewallet/">Advice Wallet</a> . <br><br>  At the moment, the organizers of the <a href="http://venturesummit.eu/">Europe Venture Summit</a> - the American-Ukrainian full-cycle incubator <a href="http://happyfarm.com.ua/">Happy Farm</a> and the American venture fund 500 Startups - are conducting a set of projects that will take part in the competition.  At the moment, 280 teams have already submitted to it.  Of these, 41% represent the United States, 40% - Europe, and the remaining 19% - the CIS. <br><br>  Applications are accepted only from projects, the volume of attracted investments in which does not exceed $ 2 million.  <a href="https://angel.co/europe-venture-summit-2013-startup-competition/apply">You can apply for participation</a> until November 8 through the social network for startups and venture investors <a href="http://angel.co/">Angel List</a> .  This selection tool was not chosen by chance - it is the most popular and effective marketing platform in the world for startups and angels.  It allows you to provide the most transparent selection conditions, as it excludes the possibility of any manipulations with the rating of projects.  And it provides the experts - jury members with full access to the entire database of applicants.  It is planned that 10 finalists and 2 reserve contestants will be selected on November 22. <br><br>  After which they will be trained for the competition on the basis of the <a href="http://happyfarm.com.ua/">Happy Farm</a> incubator.  Each team - finalist will receive 2 free passes to the event and a discount on the purchase of tickets for other members of the project. <br><br>  Startup AddVenture (Europe Venture Summit) is the largest specialized conference that will gather more than 3,000 IT entrepreneurs, venture investors, business angels and incubators from Ukraine, the CIS, Europe and the USA.
