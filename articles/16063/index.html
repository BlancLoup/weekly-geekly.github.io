In this article, I offer you 33 ways to increase your subscribers.  So let's find new subscribers for your blog. <br><br>  1. <strong>Only quality information.</strong>  I don‚Äôt like to be the first to write this tip because it‚Äôs a tip that all professional bloggers give.  But here's the reason everyone gives this advice.  There is no point in subscribing to a blog if you do not offer anything worth reading.  You must give the reader a reason to return.  If there is no reason to return, why should he subscribe? <br><br>  2. <strong>Write every day.</strong>  Let's think about why people subscribe to blogs.  Because they do not want to miss the following posts.  That is why you should write excellent articles and publish them with sufficient frequency that people would think that they can miss something.  Not bad to write one article per day.  Make your readers afraid to skip one of your articles.  (but do not forget about the first item, always write quality articles)

        <ins class="adsbygoogle"

      3. <strong>Do not write off-topic.</strong>  Always remember your blog topic.  Readers will not subscribe if you write all the time on various topics. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  4. <strong>Use the big orange RSS button.</strong>  People search for this orange button when they want to subscribe.  It has become a recognizable, universal RSS feed symbol.  I met sites where the RSS icon was a different color, blue or green, but it is recommended to use orange, because everyone is accustomed to the orange RSS icon. <br><br>  5. <strong>Post your RSS button as high as possible.</strong>  If you are trying to get your readers to do something on your blog, for example, subscribe to RSS, make sure that this feature is at the top of your blog.  People are more likely to pay attention to what is at the top of your blog. <br><br>  6. <strong>Only full texts in RSS!</strong>  Many people who use RSS readers do not subscribe to blogs with incomplete RSS posts.  I also do not subscribe.  There are about 200 RSS feeds in my reader, I cannot read them all at once, so I use search and filters on topics of interest to me.  I would like to search by the full text of the record, and not by its entry.  Many bloggers recommend using only full-text RSS feeds. <br><br>  7. <strong>Enable your readers to subscribe via E-Mail.</strong>  It‚Äôs very hard for bloggers to imagine how people live without using RSS readers, but believe me, a very small percentage of Internet users use RSS.  That is why you should give the opportunity to subscribe to your RSS feed via email.  E-mail, now uses almost every Internet user.  There are so many services that allow you to add this feature to your blog, I use FeedBurner.  Someone might like rss2email more. <br><br>  8. <strong>Speed ‚Äã‚Äãup your subscription.</strong>  Reduce the number of actions required to subscribe to the RSS feed.  Using the service FeedBurner, a great option to optimize the subscription procedure.  I once again recommend using FeedBurner for your RSS feed, now this service is becoming more and more popular, not only for subscribing your visitors, but also for statistics and calculating the blog rating. <br><br>  9. <strong>Write an article explaining what RSS is and how to subscribe to your blog.</strong>  Bloggers often forget that many of their readers may not know what RSS is and how to use it.  Write an article about RSS and your users will know that they can subscribe to a blog. <br><br>  10. <strong>Write an article explaining how to use RSS readers.</strong>  Many do not know about these programs, and do not know how they can make their lives easier.  Describe several programs, their configuration, disadvantages and advantages, tell us what programs you use to read RSS. <br><br>  11. <strong>At the end of each article, ask the reader to subscribe to your RSS feed.</strong>  Perhaps the reader will want to subscribe after reading one of your great articles, simplify this task for him.  Post an RSS icon or text link at the end of each of your posts. <br><br>  12. <strong>Use the Toodoo widget.</strong>  One of the best ways to increase the number of subscribers to your blog is to ask people to subscribe to it.  Sometimes readers should be invited or encouraged by something to subscribe.  Perhaps they did not even think about subscribing, maybe they don‚Äôt even use an RSS reader.  By offering them to subscribe, you are reminded that there is the possibility of subscribing to your blog.  The Toodoo widget shows people who are registered on the service, and visit your blog, when the widget shows a new person coming to your blog, you can click on the avatar and send him an email.  For example, thank him for visiting your blog with a request to subscribe to your blog, and a link to an RSS feed. <br><br>  13. <strong>Make sure that your blog's RSS feed is automatically detected.</strong>  You may have noticed that a small RSS icon appears in your browser.  This icon appears when the browser automatically finds the address of the RSS feed on the site you are viewing.  Check your blog and see if Internet Explorer or Firefox automatically finds your RSS feed.  Some subscribers use this method to subscribe to blogs.  You do not want to lose a subscriber, just because this feature does not work on your blog? <br><br>  14. <strong>Use the plugin ‚ÄúWhat Would Seth Godin Do‚Äù.</strong>  This plugin allows you to ask your users to subscribe to your blog.  This plugin is good because it allows you to show this request, only for new users. <br><br>  15. <strong>Write a letter to readers who comment on your blog.</strong>  Invite them to subscribe to your blog.  If the reader leaves a comment, he may want to subscribe to your blog.  Make your letter personal, the point is to make contact with the commentator. <br><br>  16. <strong>If readers wrote you a letter, make sure that you answered it.</strong>  If the reader wrote you an e-mail, this does not mean that he has already subscribed to your blog.  If you do not respond to emails, why should he subscribe to your blog?  You must remember that your readers time is precious.  If they read your blog and write you letters, they invest their time.  Do not let your investors. <br><br>  17. <strong>Link to your RSS in the form of sending comments.</strong>  I'm not sure about this method, it can sometimes annoy visitors.  However, this is also a way to attract RSS subscribers.  You decide whether you use it or not. <br><br>  18. <strong>Offer unique information that your readers will not find anywhere else.</strong>  By making your blog unique, you encourage your readers to subscribe to your blog, because they will not find such excellent information anywhere except your blog.  If you just repeat the posts of others, people can just read others. <br><br>  19. <strong>Write so that it would be convenient to read.</strong>  Blog readers usually want a lot of information in a short time.  If you write readable posts, you make it easier for visitors to read your blog.  Be sure, when writing a new post, think about how it will look in the RSS reader.  People do not always have enough time to read each RSS feed.  If you write readable posts, people will be more happy to read exactly your RSS feed. <br><br>  20. <strong>Write attractive headlines.</strong>  Make sure your headlines attract attention.  Sometimes the only chance to seduce the reader to read your blog is the title of the post.  If the title is not interesting, the reader will simply go on to read the next blog and of course will not subscribe to your RSS.  When people read articles in their RSS reader, they usually browse the headlines, and read those that interest them.  However, you do not need to write headlines that do not correspond to the content of your post.  Inappropriate headlines are a quick way to lose your RSS subscribers.  To see examples of interesting headlines, check out popular articles on social news services, News2, Habrahabr, Smi2.  Popular articles tend to have great headlines. <br><br>  21. <strong>Offer a free e-book to those who subscribe to your RSS feed.</strong>  This is a good way to attract subscribers with additional content. <br><br>  22. <strong>Offer access to classified information only for RSS subscribers.</strong>  If you report that only your subscribers will have access to additional information, visitors will begin to subscribe to your blog.  This can be a closed forum, or a password to some closed records.  For convenience, you can use Feedvertising plugin, it allows you to insert a link into the post, which will be visible only to RSS subscribers. <br><br>  23. <strong>Write guest posts.</strong>  When you write guest posts, you advertise your blog on other blogs.  It gives you the chance to turn the followers of another blog into your blog followers.  However, be careful.  In guest posts, you need to write great posts.  If, as a guest post, you write posts of average quality, you lose the opportunity to attract new visitors to your blog. <br><br>  24. <strong>Participate in blogging contests and events.</strong>  It is very useful to participate in contests and events in which a large number of bloggers and readers participate.  The more attention you attract to your blog, the more subscribers you can get to your blog. <br><br>  25. <strong>Invite other bloggers to your blog for guest posts.</strong>  This will not only add great articles to your site, but also new visitors and subscribers, because a blogger who writes a guest post, as a rule, reports about it in his blog so that his readers can read the guest post. <br><br>  26. <strong>Start podcasting.</strong>  Keeping podcasts can also increase the number of subscribers to your blog.  Not many bloggers have podcasts.  That is why podcasting will help you to stand out among the rest of bloggers. <br><br>  27. <strong>Actively communicate on the forums.</strong>  Leave a pleasant impression by talking in different forums.  By helping people on topics that are related to your blog's niche, you will recommend yourself as an expert in your field and they will want to subscribe to your blog. <br><br>  28. <strong>Link to your RSS feed, in the signature on the forums and in the E-mail.</strong>  This will allow your readers to quickly subscribe to your blog.  Alternatively, you can write two links to your blog and to your RSS feed, and the reader decides what he wants. <br><br>  29. <strong>Refer to articles in other blogs.</strong>  Readers can subscribe to your blog, knowing that you always give additional sources of information in their posts. <br><br>  30. <strong>Register your blog's RSS feed in RSS directories.</strong>  The more directories you know about your blog's RSS feed, the more people will be able to subscribe to your blog. <br><br>  31. <strong>Use paid advertising to increase visitors to your blog.</strong>  People coming from contextual links are interested in information from your niche, some of them will subscribe to your blog.  I recommend using Google.Adwords or Yandex.Direct advertising. <br><br>  32. <strong>Articles should contain your opinion or comments about the news in your niche.</strong>  People are more likely to subscribe to your blog if your thoughts are expressed in it, for any of the topics or news.  They can read news on any news service, but your thoughts and your view of them can only be found on your blog. <br><br>  33. <strong>Publish the number of your subscribers.</strong>  As soon as you have more than 100 subscribers, I recommend publishing the number of subscribers to your blog.  People are more inclined to follow someone than to lead.  If people see that many are already subscribed to your blog, they will subscribe too. <br><br>  This article is a free translation of the article " <a href="http://newestonthenet.com/35-guaranteed-ways-to-increase-your-rss-subscribers/">35 Guaranteed Ways To Increase Your RSS Subscribers</a> ". </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/16063/">https://habr.com/ru/post/16063/</a></p>
