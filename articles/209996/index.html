It has long been known that according to statistics, all people are half men and women.  What has a bit more women. <br><br>  The task was to find out which letter threads work better and which ones worse.  And just need to understand what is good and bad.  To do this, we took 157517 letters (all these letters were sent in one month) and analyzed how people open them.  What conclusions received - under habrakat. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  For starters <b>top three</b> :

    <ol><li>  Director of the educational institution (86.38%) <br></li><li>  Skype chatting (85.18%) <br></li><li>  Congratulations from the company * famous MLM *!  (83.10%) <br></li></ol><br>  The statistics were collected from letters that were sent to at least 500 people.  Letters from the top three were sent to the database from 3 to 5 thousand subscribers. <br><br>  The entire conditional "top" is occupied by <b>letters waiting</b> : <br><br><ul><li>  price lists; <br></li><li>  webinar time alerts; <br></li><li>  messages from network marketing companies with prizes. <br></li></ul><br>  The first conclusion that can be drawn from these statistics: <br><br><h1>  It is important to whom you write <br></h1><br>  Some used the base cleansing method ‚Äúvizhiganiye‚Äù to obtain such indicators: <br><br><ol><li>  We send the letter to all base <br></li><li>  According to the results we break the base on the Readers and the Readers. <br></li><li>  For those who read more and more often, unread - only the best and no more than a week. <br></li><li>  Then we select another third group - those who bought it, but this is a completely different topic. <br></li></ol><br>  We confirmed that it is important to correctly assemble and clean the base - let's go further. <br><br><h2>  Average hospital temperature <br></h2><br>  <b>8.79%</b> - such an average OpenRate for all letters.  1.27% is the average percentage of clicks. <br>  0.09% - the average ratio of unsubscribing from the mailing. <br><br>  We assume that these indicators - <b>this is our bad</b> . <br><br>  Most common: <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Specific words:</b> <br></li><li>  Invitation. <br></li><li>  Sell-out. </li><li>  New. </li><li>  Webinar <br></li><li>  News. </li><li>  <b>Situational words:</b> <br></li><li>  The name of the countries for tourists, for example, HUNGARY: UNFORGETTABLE HOLIDAYS AND TREATMENT ON LAKE BALATON.  TOURS FROM ‚Ç¨ 1720 - such names gain from 4 to 21% of discoveries, but their main array is concentrated in the area of ‚Äã‚Äã6%. <br></li><li>  Names of companies. </li></ul><br><h3>  Using special characters in the subject <br></h3><br>  Airplanes, hearts, snowflakes, watch, currency icons and so on.  Average Open Rate - 10%.  Values ‚Äã‚Äãabove 30% - 20 of almost 7 thousand. <br><br>  At the same time, most of our clients refrained from using special characters in alerts and reminders. <br><br>  [offtop] UniSender conducted split testing for one online store.  Including special characters were checked.  The difference was 2.6% in favor of the version of the theme without special characters [/ offtop] <br><br><h3>  Use of tags (substitutions) <br></h3><br>  You can substitute anything and anywhere.  But most UniSender clients put a name tag at the beginning of the topic. <br><br>  For example: <br><br><ul><li>  {{first_name |  Take}} {{first_name?, Take}} your gift - 20% of discoveries. </li><li>  {{Name}} - A delicious GIFT is waiting for you!  - 24%. </li><li>  At the same time - {{fname | LocalPart}}, play for free - win real money!  - 2% <br></li></ul><br>  In the topics of letters in which there is a substitution of the name - the average percentage of discoveries - 11.64% <br>  On the one hand, this may be due to the use of personalization, and may indicate the level of marketers who do mailings. <br><br><h3>  Questions <br></h3><br>  Building a question in the title - conditionally increases the percentage of discoveries. <br><br>  For example, the average Open Rate for titles that start with How is 11.39%.  If, again, playing a little with statistics is 29% more than the average Open Rate for all letters. <br><br>  <i>A small note: E-mail mailing services measure discoverability like this ‚Äî insert a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_bug">‚Äútransparent pixel‚Äù</a> .</i>  <i>Each upload of this image is recorded as an opening.</i>  <i>If the recipient has opened the letter and uploaded the pictures - the opening is registered.</i>  <i>Also, it is believed that there is a discovery, if a person followed any link in the letter.</i> <br><br><h1>  Findings: </h1><br>  Controversial.  Such made the author.  Write in the comments what you did <br><br><ol><li>  Much more important to whom you write, not the title. </li><li>  To begin with, titles should be written using <a href="http://www.unisender.com/ru/services/obuchenie/app/kak_pisat_temy_pisem/">simple formulas</a> . </li><li>  It is important to test on your own database substitutions, questions, special characters. </li><li>  Specific sentences in letters (for example, specific countries or specific webinars) work only when a person is waiting for them.  Otherwise they work worse than neutral titles. </li></ol><br>  Write in the comments what other data you want to get, we will analyze further. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/209996/">https://habr.com/ru/post/209996/</a></p>
