  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Why I do not believe in the possibility of improving the service in Sberbank</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Based on yesterday's <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/sberbank/blog/113374/">post on Sberbank's blog</a> about how they are going to increase their ‚Äúlow level of customer service.‚Äù  Already when I read this regulation itself (I will not lie, I haven‚Äôt read further on the first page), I had thoughts in the head in my head ‚Äúand let's introduce fines for poverty - it will be unprofitable for the poor and everyone will get rich‚Äù. <br><br>  Today I understood the reason for my skepticism when I remembered the new interface of Sberbank ATMs (which was <a href="http://www.sbrf.ru/moscow/ru/press_center/tb_all/index.php%3Fid114%3D11002466">announced</a> with fanfare <a href="http://www.sbrf.ru/moscow/ru/press_center/tb_all/index.php%3Fid114%3D11002466">a year ago</a> ). <br><br>  Do you know how to identify a non-working Sberbank ATM from afar?  If there is no queue, the Sberbank ATM does not work.  The reverse is not true (if there is a queue, the Sberbank ATM may still not work).  It would seem that Sberbank ATMs in Moscow are an <a href="http://bankomator.ru/">unreal heap</a> , whence the queue?

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  What operations are most often performed through an ATM?  Well, of course, the issuance of cash, the request for the balance and, possibly, some kind of payment (opsozy, utilities, etc.).  All other operations are used a negligible number of times.  The normal ATM interface looks like this (the first available picture on request is the Ural Bank for Reconstruction and Development): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6b7/df1/34d/6b7df134dcfe986c85768c971b689b62.png"><br><br>  Nothing more - three basic operations + PIN change, information and a large ‚Äúshutdown‚Äù button.  There are no menu items for two more buttons - there‚Äôs nothing to be done, let them be empty. <br><br>  Well, now take a look at the Savings Bank masterpiece. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5b7/cd5/fff/5b7cd5fff106cd5a1d5876a3ed6340cc.jpg"><br><br>  ‚ÄúIn the new design of our public transport stops everything is provided - metal seats in case of frost, a transparent roof in case of sunny weather and holes in the walls in case of wind‚Äù (c) an unknown satirist. <br><br>  First of all, it is necessary to bring the ‚ÄúInternet service‚Äù and ‚ÄúMobile Bank‚Äù to the most important places - well, of course, any ATM user will first of all climb there! <br><br>  We will call the issue of money ‚ÄúCash Operations‚Äù (nothing that there can only be withdrawn cash, and to put it - separate buttons).  By the way, the variety of amounts in the withdrawal menu is amazing - with one touch you can remove one, two, three, four or five thousand rubles.  Very comfortably. <br><br>  Now try to guess where the balance is.  I also scratched my turnips for the first time and went through the menu in order.  He is in the "Information and Service", suddenly!  What you need to be an idiot to the most frequently used function to thrust into the second level of the menu with the most vague name?  And after all these idiots still paid money for it!  Coordinated, come on, this design with top management, probably still held presentations and conferences, showed this nightmare of Tyoma Lebedev (I suppose it is these interfaces that Tema is dreaming about in nightmares) to a bunch of people! <br><br>  I imagine how unhappy pensioners for the first time try to check whether they have received a pension.  I think even the most educated at this moment think of the developer of this interface only with obscenities.  And the rest of the queue at this moment curses the brake pensioner. <br><br>  But from the payment of services it is necessary to make three points and to damn the dogs all menu, so that neither for balance, nor for the ‚Äúgive card‚Äù button there is no place left, and the unfortunate owners of Sberbank's credit cards poked a few minutes into the screen in search of the magic button completion of work ". <br><br>  So how do you think the queues at Sberbank ATMs will disappear, if you install them twice as much and repair them twice as fast?  Yes, hell with two!  The interface of the Sberbank ATM even makes technically savvy people feel like idiots and poke all the buttons in a row.  But technically savvy customers from Sberbank - an absolute minority.  One gets the feeling that the new interface was designed specifically to confuse as much as possible and introduce people already far from the technology into a stupor. <br><br>  No organizational measures will help here until the leadership of the Security Council of the Russian Federation condescends, finally, to at least try to use its own service.  While the top managers who make decisions will not stand in line to the average ATM (and any other Sberbank service), there will be no change for the better in the Sberbank service. <br><br>  UPD.  Especially for the Sberbank service - a number of constructive suggestions: <br><br>  0. Personally use all the services of Sberbank. <br>  1. The ‚ÄúBalance‚Äù button should be called ‚ÄúBalance‚Äù and be on the first page. <br>  2. The button "Cash withdrawal" should be called "Cash withdrawal" and be on the first page. <br>  3. The ‚ÄúShutdown‚Äù button should be called ‚ÄúShutdown‚Äù and be on the first page. <br>  4. Of all the other buttons, you can make one menu ‚ÄúPayments‚Äù and not clutter up the interface. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/113445/">https://habr.com/ru/post/113445/</a></p>
