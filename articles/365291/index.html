It was a special event for iRidium because it was the first time when the company publicly presented its most important product of this year. <br><br> <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/iridiummobile/blog/247838/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/90b/e0d/578/90be0d578cb440a09dfee32f1b18a755.png"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  IRidium Big Premiere: Bongo </h4><br>  Until now, iRidium was a company for developers - first of all, for integrator companies, but also interesting for those who are not averse to doing something with their own hands.  This year, iRidium mobile is entering the user market for the first time, launching an application not for smart home developers, but for those who will live in them. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3b0/dda/cd0/3b0ddacd06dd47a39ad384136afaf20a.png">

      From the user's point of view, this is an application that finds all smart devices, all Internet of Things gadgets on your network, allowing you to remotely access, manage, configure, save configurations in the Bongo Cloud cloud and share it with other users and on other control devices. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0b3/992/1c6/0b39921c65004882a2c7f5fb0d485c1c.jpg"><br><br>  The technology's slogan is ‚ÄúBongo: everything is under control‚Äù (Bongo - Everything is under Control).  This is iRidium's answer to fragmenting the Internet of Things market at present, which still lacks a single standard that could unite different devices from different manufacturers. <br><br>  Of course, the effective work of Bongo implies that the application is ‚Äúfamiliar‚Äù with the devices used by users - i.e.  There must be thousands of devices in the Bongo library.  And here iRidium's extensive experience is most welcome.  As the head of the company Sergey Korolyov said: ‚ÄúDeveloping iRidium, we prepared the platform for Bongo.  This is the best thing we have ever done. ‚Äù <br><br>  I will tell you more about Bongo in the following articles.  Ask questions in the comments, we together with iRidium mobile will definitely answer them. <br><br>  For now, let's take a look at MATE, which was held simultaneously with the ‚ÄúInternet of Things‚Äù conference, at which iRidium presented Bongo. <br><br><h4>  MATE Exhibition </h4><br>  MATE for three days captured a pavilion of the Sokolniki Exhibition Center.  In addition to the conference, an exhibition was also held at the event - dozens of booths represented almost the entire range of ideas and gadgets that are now attracting the attention of the audience.  Pay attention to some of them. <br><br><h5>  The virtual reality </h5><br>  Without a demonstration of the possibilities of virtual reality, not a single big event can now do.  IoT-conf was no exception: visitors could play at once with two developments in this genre - the Oculus Rift, long familiar to everyone, and the new Russian development of Fibrum.  Unlike the "Oculus", the Fibrum is simply a helmet and software; any hardware of a suitable size and characteristics serves as an "iron" in it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/137/7b1/1c7/1377b11c72014349b1000d12abdcff99.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Vs</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c04/37e/145/c0437e14558041a7a0e4dbe2de130dbb.jpg"><br><br>  Having compared both (conveniently, both Fibrum and the company that brought Oculus to the exhibition, they used a very similar rollercoaster ride program as a demo), I can say that Oculus copes with the task of causing dizziness out of the blue it is better.  And Fibrum needs to seriously work on the sound quality in their programs so that it contributes, rather than interferes with immersion in a virtual environment. <br><br><h5>  Cars </h5><br>  Remoto attracted the attention of visitors with the help of Kia pasted over with their logos.  Judging by the description on their website, the application chip is the functionality of an advanced alarm system (event notifications with a car, remote climate start and route tracking), stuck in the application and without the security function itself. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2a1/496/b32/2a1496b32c1e4c6ead2f7a256f95cb37.jpg"><br><br>  But of course, the Tesla Model S was the main head turner on the presentation. Of course, it doesn‚Äôt cause a stir ‚Äî besides this is not a new Model D, but as a wedding general demonstrating the level of the event, she coped well. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e65/3e2/df3/e653e2df304e4a9aa5dbb95f3b1f2c17.jpg"><br><br>  Of course, what a technology exhibition without 3D printers: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e97/e0d/de2/e97e0dde21c448f38bd7490f1bf69bfd.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/468/2b8/6e1/4682b86e15ba4cb78124755ce3ccdcce.jpg"><br><br><h5>  Geolocation on the premises </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/929/d04/d9a/929d04d9a68e49c3a8a4738cefe8e201.jpg"><br><br>  The iBecom company told and showed to everyone the <a href="http://ibecom.ru/products/ibecom-beacons">technology of geolocation in the premises</a> , working on the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) protocol. <br><br>  Of course, this list of participants is not exhausted - I brought only, perhaps, the most photogenic part of the exhibition.  But the companies that put their stands on it were much more - including those that are not connected directly to the Internet of things (for example, the accounting service ‚ÄúMy Business‚Äù), but were interested in once again lighten up before the advanced public. . <br><br><h5>  Stand iRidium mobile </h5><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/42b/b52/a0c/42bb52a0c5074d8491ce67da287c4e3a.jpg"><br><br>  All day at the iRidium mobile stand, the company's employees who specially arrived at the exhibition from Nizhny Tagil answered questions about the company's developments, including the latest Bongo and another new development - iRidium Server, which can work as part of Bongo, and as an independent solution that meets for data collection, graphing, script processing. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a6e/994/de5/a6e994de56c34c79b7d2b3defbc53196.jpg"><br><br>  In addition to their own products, the company's partners were present at the iRidium stand: <a href="http://www.z-wave.me/">Z-Wave</a> and <a href="http://www.hdlrus.ru/">HDL Automation</a> demonstrated control in conjunction with Bongo, <a href="http://www.coolautomation.com/">Coolmaster</a> and <a href="http://www.evika.ru/">Evika</a> , which demonstrated its new <a href="http://evika.ru/katalog/catalog_evika_lm4-llight/">LogicMachine4</a> controller. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/521/c4c/6c7/521c4c6c7ec849c482cd6f98e2e0cacd.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ed3/a77/2b0/ed3a772b09db4f7693f87ddc42543712.jpg"><br><br><h4>  IRidium presentation </h4><br>  The highlight of the iRidium participation program at the conference was the presentation of Nikolay Rusanov, a representative of iRidium mobile in Russia and the CIS. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c54/06f/719/c5406f719ae74cc8a5c3c7f513b5eae5.jpg"><br><br>  He talked about what the status quo of smart homes and the Internet of things are today and where the market is moving in the coming decades: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/399/562/20a/39956220ad864506811d7026b4a83c3d.png"><br><br>  Some have already begun to prepare for this beautiful future: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d1e/05c/864/d1e05c864d70438f8082562846d12e19.jpg"><br><br>  You can see the full <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/iRidiumMobile365/ss-46081230">iRidium presentation</a> below, which is definitely worth spending a couple of minutes on it: <br><br><div class="slideshow"><iframe src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/46081230&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgweQzmTCEBU-ZzW08iPRbiUGrFeQ" width="425" height="355" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><br>  By the way, this Friday, Nikolai will repeat his encore speech at the <a href="https://my.webinar.ru/event/474023/%3Ft%3D83246">‚ÄúSmart Home and Internet of Things‚Äù webinar</a> .
