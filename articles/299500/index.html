The guys give a lot of tips to sellers based on their research.  They study the psychology and behavior of users.

    <br><br>  <b>Earlier,</b> we already <a href="http://www.carrotquest.io/blog/38-prodazh-za-schet-onlajn-konsultanta-dlya-sajta-kak-dobitsya-takogo-pokazatelya/">said</a> that at the last stages of online shopping, users experience a heightened sense of risk, so it is necessary to take the initiative in their own hands and lead such users to the purchase. <br><br>  How to sell to potential customers, while taking into account the behavioral and psychological characteristics of people: <br><br><br><h2>  <b>Step 1: Come up with a chip on contact</b> </h2><br>  Always start your conversation with some chips.  Once, one study was conducted on how to increase the number of tips for waiters.  The result was unexpected: it was only necessary to start servicing the client, using a positive comment.  When the guest came into the restaurant, the waiter wished him good morning and gave the weather forecast for the day, of course, positive.  Tipping has increased by 27%! <br><br>  This is an example of working with the user offline, and on the Internet this is a little different.  Users value their time, so pay attention only to the most relevant information.  When you know with 100% certainty what interests the user, then you start the conversation as you need. <br><br><br><br>  See how it looks in the <a href="http://www.carrotquest.io/%3Futm_source%3Dmegam%26utm_medium%3Dcontent%26utm_content%3D6tactik%26utm_campaign%3Dsale">Carrot Quest</a> service, which collects information about each visitor on the site (an example of one of the tour operators) and provides key tools for communicating with users (chat, email, pop-up windows, call): <br><br>  The manager saw what the user was interested in and made a specific offer (highlighted in red in the screenshot).  This approach is relevant for all tools (call, chat, letter). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/aaf/3dd/b5e/aaf3ddb5e35c5d6f723102bb867a2933.png" alt="image"><br><br><br><br><br><br>  If suddenly a user called you, the service will also record it in his card.  You will know his phone number and you can always call back with a specific offer (because he is really interested). <br><br><br><h2>  <b>Step 2: Never criticize your competitors</b> </h2><br>  The biggest mistake is to criticize your competitor. <br><br>  Suppose if you say that your competitor‚Äôs product is of poor quality and cannot be relied on, then your potential client will think subconsciously that you yourself came to them with a poor-quality product and you yourself are irresponsible, although they realize that you are talking about your competitor. <br><br>  That is why it is worth remembering: prepare in advance your advantages in relation to each competitor, but in none of them do you speak ill of a competitor (even if this is actually the case). <br><br><br><h2>  <b>Step 3: Use Positive Labels</b> </h2><br>  When you call someone smart or good, then the person subconsciously tries to begin to conform to these labels.  In one study of donations, Science of People, states the following: a group of people were told that their level of donations is the highest among all others, but in fact these people donated rather average amounts of money.  After some time, they began to sacrifice even more. <br><br>  When you communicate with a client or a potential client, let him know that you consider him an excellent client, however, do not overdo it.  The option ‚ÄúYou are one of our best clients‚Äù or ‚ÄúWork with you is a pleasure.‚Äù  Thus, the client associates himself with his idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe best client and subconsciously begins to act like this. <br><br>  But constantly saying standard phrases is not the most effective solution.  It is worth knowing the user better.  To do this, in <a href="http://www.carrotquest.io/%3Futm_source%3Dmegam%26utm_medium%3Dcontent%26utm_content%3D6tactik%26utm_campaign%3Dsale">Carrot Quest,</a> we automatically receive the user's contacts in the social.  networks (highlighted in red in the screenshot).  You can look at the client profile and build your dialogue based on this. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/a7d/ad5/f23/a7dad5f23842d6fe1f25059b6af2429b.png" alt="image"><br><br><br><br>  With soc.  phishing is in no way connected, because  we receive social network contacts only if the user has left his email address - we consider this approach the only correct one and oppose any fraudulent schemes (such as social phishing). <br><br><br><h2>  <b>Step 4: Do not forget the agenda and give the client a sense of control.</b> </h2><br>  When calling or chatting in a chat, managers should always mention the agenda and find out the client‚Äôs opinion about it.  In this way, they give clients a sense of control, the client feels more comfortable in this case.  For example, you can say ‚ÄúI am glad that I managed to contact today.  Let's discuss topic 1. What do you say? " <br><br>  In this case, you need to keep the entire history of correspondence with the user in one place (it does not matter, email, call, chat, or something else).  Therefore, in Carrot Quest, we have integrated key communication tools.  The whole history of communication on them is available in the user's card (any of the managers is always aware of which ‚Äúpath the client has already passed‚Äù) <br><br><br><h2>  <b>Step 5: Show Your Uniqueness</b> </h2><br>  The customer must feel in the seller the energy and passion for the product.  Infect a customer with your fever.  It is for this reason that salespeople usually sit together, rather than each sitting in a separate conference room. <br><br>  Find the benefits of your product that you yourself are crazy about.  Use them constantly, charge yourself with energy and share it with customers. <br><br><br><h2>  <b>Step 6: Highlight the important intonation</b> </h2><br>  In addition, focus on intonation when making a phone call or on punctuation and signs when writing - this gives an excellent effect.  Especially when you leave a voice message or just send email.  Highlighting the right words, you kind of lacquer your speech, paying attention to the right topics.  You become more and more convincing. <br><br><br><br>  With Pleasure, the team of <a href="http://www.carrotquest.io/%3Futm_source%3Dmegam%26utm_medium%3Dcontent%26utm_content%3D6tactik%26utm_campaign%3Dsale"><b>Carrot Quest</b></a> is a service that collects key information about each visitor to your site and helps guide him to the purchase, both manually and automatically. <br><br>  Some of the information is translated from the <a href="http://www.scienceofpeople.com/">Science of People</a> blog and <a href="http://www.hubspot.com/">HubSpot</a> <br><br>  Subscribe to our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/carrotquest/">Facebook page</a> , we constantly publish the most useful materials. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/299500/">https://habr.com/ru/post/299500/</a></p>
