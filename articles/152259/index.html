  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Our tools at our institutes, or why a laptop engineer</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  We can assume that this post of surprise.  We can assume that I'm still not calm down. <br>  Here I spoke on the subject of recording lectures (conducting notes) on a laptop.  It was convenient for me at one time, and I decided to find out who thinks about this topic.  After reading many comments on this post, I realized that I don‚Äôt understand a lot about life and studies. <br><br>  I will start from afar, go under the cat, well, be sure to KDPV: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/df5/d2c/329/df5d2c3293874028522a325474646809.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  This photo hangs on the <a href="https://www.edx.org/">EDX</a> website - MIT, Harvard and Princeton initiatives in the field of online learning.  In the photo - MIT students (there is written on the doors of the Eleven Cambridge Center).  Each of them has a laptop in their hands.  It is clear why they have a laptop in their hands - because they are MIT students and (most important) - future engineers.  Because I think they think that they will earn their living with the help of computers. <br><br>  Is it so?  Or do they just <s>pontal</s> check mail in between pairs?  Let's take a look at, for example, the MIT-shnuyu lecture on YouTube, dated 2008: <br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/k6U-i4gXkLM%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhgHNMLyM_HmlOavU0Rrrd0UTpeUJw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  We squander in the course of the lecture, look at the audience.  Fak!  Yes, there are a lot of people with laptops, someone on the course of the lecture shows someone to someone (probably, add a diagram in the Word).  This is unreal cool.  This is (in my subjective opinion) the beginnings of professionalism - young people strive to solve problems with the tools they will use in their professional activities.  And the lecturer does not present them with material in some ‚Äúother special‚Äù form - in the form of prepared slides, for example.  He read and wrote on the blackboard, and he writes - nothing changes in this part of the interface.

      It really seems to me logical and very correct that a student for five years tries to carry out his entire training staff with the help of some applications on a laptop.  After all, then he will come to work, they will give him a laptop.  And on him he will do his work. <br><br>  So why do we think that we have to operate with pen and paper for five years, draw (for example) UML diagrams in notebooks, and not on tablets? <br>  And why, having come to work, give me a laptop and a workplace with a pussy, and not a blackboard with markers, a set of pencils and a stack of paper? <br>  Well, it's clear why - because all engineers, in all areas, somehow or other, do their work with the help of computers and software - whether they are compilers, CAD or mathematical modeling tools. <br><br>  The idea was voiced that keeping the abstract with your hand allows you to better remember the material.  Typing on the keyboard does not leave anything in the memory.  Maybe that's why I can't figure out the code I wrote six months ago?  Maybe it is better to write it by hand, give the code monkey, let it fill, compile, and I have my own leaves in my daddy with my feet?  Glue the tag ‚Äúv.0.18‚Äù and take it to the room with a Git sign.  To hell with sarcasm. <br><br>  The human brain is very much changed under the influence of the fact that with the development of the Internet information has become easily accessible.  Twenty years ago it was decided to sit in the library and read books.  From start to finish.  It was the only way to deal with the problem.  Now you can "just google".  This is such a trend.  This is how the world is changing, including ways to get an education.  And, in my opinion, living and learning with the help of your laptop is the same trend, only somewhat undervalued in our education system. <br><br>  I do not want to reduce everything to a holivar ‚Äúwarm tube notebook‚Äù against ‚Äúsoulless cold PDFa‚Äù, I just want to convey the idea that when studying at the institute, you need to force yourself to work in ‚Äúcombat‚Äù conditions - you need to be able to throw layouts (anything), commit lectures in git, try Matane in Agile style, keep track of your time, set tasks for yourself in Megaplan, control deadlines, etc.  Being digital, in short.  How to do it without beech - I do not know. <br><br>  In the comments I call my digital-minded (if there are any).  Thank. <br><br>  PS As a counter-argument to myself, I will only point out that in the course of conducting interviews, the tasks are still asked to be solved on pieces of paper, yes. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/152259/">https://habr.com/ru/post/152259/</a></p>
