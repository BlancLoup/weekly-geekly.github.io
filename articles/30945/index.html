      <strong><abbr title="Random Access Memory (RAM)">RAM</abbr> vs <abbr title="Read-Only Memory (&amp; quot; read-only &amp; quot; - historically established name, read-only memory, ROM)">ROM</abbr></strong> <br><br>  All abbreviations about which we will speak here refer to the type of memory.  Memory is used to store data on your device.  Phone numbers, pictures, programs, music, etc.  etc.  - all this requires memory.  Ignoring outdated technologies that no one uses now, as well as such rare and exotic ones that are not intended for the mass market yet, there are two types of memory: <abbr title="Random Access Memory (RAM)">RAM</abbr> and <abbr title="Read-Only Memory (&amp; quot; read-only &amp; quot; - historically established name, read-only memory, ROM)">ROM</abbr> .  Their similarity is that they are designed to store data.  But their main differences are in the speed of work and energy consumed. <br><br>  <em><abbr title="Random Access Memory (RAM)">RAM</abbr></em> : very fast, but consumes enough energy. <br>  <em><abbr title="Read-Only Memory (&amp; quot; read-only &amp; quot; - historically established name, read-only memory, ROM)">ROM</abbr></em> : much slower, but more energy efficient. <br><br>  But, more significantly, <abbr title="Random Access Memory (RAM)">RAM</abbr> needs constant power to store data, while <abbr title="Read-Only Memory (&amp; quot; read-only &amp; quot; - historically established name, read-only memory, ROM)">ROM</abbr> does not.  In other words, if your battery runs out of power, the data in the <abbr title="Random Access Memory (RAM)">RAM</abbr> will be lost, but not in the <abbr title="Read-Only Memory (&amp; quot; read-only &amp; quot; - historically established name, read-only memory, ROM)">ROM</abbr> . <br><br>  <strong>How is it used?</strong> <br><br>  Before the advent of <abbr title="Windows Mobile 5.0">WM5</abbr> , this was a difficult issue.  With <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/windowsmobile/archive/2005/07/14/438991.aspx">Persistent Storage</a> , everything has become much easier. <br><br>  <abbr title="Read-Only Memory (&amp; quot; read-only &amp; quot; - historically established name, read-only memory, ROM)">ROM</abbr> is the <em>storage</em> location.  All programs and <abbr title="Operational System (operating system)">OS</abbr> , which represent the software on the device, are stored in <abbr title="Read-Only Memory (&amp; quot; read-only &amp; quot; - historically established name, read-only memory, ROM)">ROM</abbr> .  Your data is also stored in <abbr title="Read-Only Memory (&amp; quot; read-only &amp; quot; - historically established name, read-only memory, ROM)">ROM</abbr> .  Both <abbr title="Secure digital">SD</abbr> and <abbr title="CompactFlash">CF</abbr> memory cards are <abbr title="Read-Only Memory (&amp; quot; read-only &amp; quot; - historically established name, read-only memory, ROM)">ROM</abbr> storage.  In fact, your device was implanted with an <abbr title="Secure digital">SD card</abbr> that you cannot remove. <br><br>  <abbr title="Random Access Memory (RAM)">RAM</abbr> is the place where programs <em>are executed</em> .  When you turn on your device, programs from <abbr title="Read-Only Memory (&amp; quot; read-only &amp; quot; - historically established name, read-only memory, ROM)">ROM</abbr> are loaded into <abbr title="Random Access Memory (RAM)">RAM</abbr> and already there, in <abbr title="Random Access Memory (RAM)">RAM</abbr> , they work.  When you listen to music, some of the composition is loaded from <abbr title="Read-Only Memory (&amp; quot; read-only &amp; quot; - historically established name, read-only memory, ROM)">ROM</abbr> to <abbr title="Random Access Memory (RAM)">RAM</abbr> , played back, unloaded back, and loads the next part, etc.  When you read an email, the text is loaded from <abbr title="Read-Only Memory (&amp; quot; read-only &amp; quot; - historically established name, read-only memory, ROM)">ROM</abbr> to <abbr title="Random Access Memory (RAM)">RAM</abbr> and displayed on the screen.  When you move to the next letter, the old text is unloaded from memory and the new text is loaded.  Turning back to the previous letter, it will again be loaded from <abbr title="Read-Only Memory (&amp; quot; read-only &amp; quot; - historically established name, read-only memory, ROM)">ROM</abbr> to <abbr title="Random Access Memory (RAM)">RAM</abbr> .  <strong>Note</strong>  <strong>translator: the</strong> <em>process of loading and unloading data is described formally, to simplify the model, but the essence remains the same.</em> <br><br>  So, generally speaking, the amount of available <abbr title="Random Access Memory (RAM)">RAM</abbr> determines the amount of simultaneously loaded data.  And the amount of <abbr title="Read-Only Memory (&amp; quot; read-only &amp; quot; - historically established name, read-only memory, ROM)">ROM</abbr> - how much data you can store on your device. <br><br>  <strong>How much memory do I need?</strong> <br><br>  Due to the nature of the hardware limitations, the amount of memory is clearly regulated.  Deviations are rare.  Basically, the amount of memory is not less than 32Mb and increases, remaining a multiple of two.  32MB, 64MB, 128MB, 256MB, etc. <br><br>  A ‚Äútypical‚Äù <abbr title="Windows Mobile 5.0">WM5</abbr> device will have 64MB of <abbr title="Random Access Memory (RAM)">RAM</abbr> .  32MB of <abbr title="Random Access Memory (RAM)">RAM</abbr> will only be appropriate if the device uses the " <abbr title="Memory type based on the logical operation &amp; quot; Not OR &amp; quot; (NOT-OR)">NOR</abbr> " <abbr title="Read-Only Memory (&amp; quot; read-only &amp; quot; - historically established name, read-only memory, ROM)">ROM</abbr> (more on this later).  Due to the high power consumption, there is a ‚Äúflip side of the coin‚Äù with too much <abbr title="Random Access Memory (RAM)">RAM</abbr> .  And, for this reason, 128MB of <abbr title="Random Access Memory (RAM)">RAM is</abbr> unlikely, but it is possible for certain ‚Äúprofessional use‚Äù devices. <br><br>  So, a ‚Äútypical‚Äù <abbr title="Windows Mobile 5.0">WM5</abbr> device will have 64MB of <abbr title="Random Access Memory (RAM)">RAM</abbr> .  There are no other limitations, besides the cost, to have more <abbr title="Random Access Memory (RAM)">RAM</abbr> .  However, if you can afford it, then more <abbr title="Random Access Memory (RAM)">RAM</abbr> will never be superfluous. <br><br>  There are many different versions of <abbr title="Windows Mobile 5.0">WM5</abbr> - Smartphone, PocketPC, PocketPC Phone Edition, and their variations.  The language of the operating system also affects the choice of memory size (for example, Asian fonts occupy a large amount of memory).  But, a rough rule of thumb can be formulated as follows: the software of your device will take about 32MB.  So, if you buy a typical device with 64MB <abbr title="Read-Only Memory (&amp; quot; read-only &amp; quot; - historically established name, read-only memory, ROM)">ROM</abbr> , then you can store about 32MB of your own data.  If you have a 128MB <abbr title="Read-Only Memory (&amp; quot; read-only &amp; quot; - historically established name, read-only memory, ROM)">ROM</abbr> - you can store about 96MB of your data. <br><br>  You do not need to throw me angry letters if you buy a device with 64MB of <abbr title="Read-Only Memory (&amp; quot; read-only &amp; quot; - historically established name, read-only memory, ROM)">ROM</abbr> and you only have 30MB free.  All devices are different, so the amount of available memory is also different. <br><br>  We need to find a compromise.  Other things being equal, I would prefer a device with 32MB of <abbr title="Random Access Memory (RAM)">RAM</abbr> and 128MB of <abbr title="Read-Only Memory (&amp; quot; read-only &amp; quot; - historically established name, read-only memory, ROM)">ROM</abbr> , compared to a device that has 64MB of <abbr title="Random Access Memory (RAM)">RAM</abbr> and 64MB of <abbr title="Read-Only Memory (&amp; quot; read-only &amp; quot; - historically established name, read-only memory, ROM)">ROM</abbr> .  But I would like 64MB <abbr title="Random Access Memory (RAM)">RAM</abbr> and 256MB <abbr title="Read-Only Memory (&amp; quot; read-only &amp; quot; - historically established name, read-only memory, ROM)">ROM</abbr> :-).  Of course, the latter would have cost <em>significantly</em> more. <br><br>  See how all this is marketed by marketers.  Some say: ‚ÄúWe provide 64Mb <abbr title="Read-Only Memory (&amp; quot; read-only &amp; quot; - historically established name, read-only memory, ROM)">ROM</abbr> ‚Äù, others say ‚Äú30Mb available for user data‚Äù.  They mean the same thing, but talk about it in different words.  Although, due to the nature of marketing, I am sure that they would prefer to talk about the big numbers :-). <br><br>  <strong>What about other capital letters?</strong> <br><br>  Now let's go to <abbr title="Memory type based on the logical operation &amp; quot; Not AND &amp; quot; (NOT-AND)">NAND</abbr> and <abbr title="Memory type based on the logical operation &amp; quot; Not OR &amp; quot; (NOT-OR)">NOR</abbr> .  These are the two main types of <abbr title="Read-Only Memory (&amp; quot; read-only &amp; quot; - historically established name, read-only memory, ROM)">ROM</abbr> .  They are, to a large extent, used in the same way, and everything I said about <abbr title="Read-Only Memory (&amp; quot; read-only &amp; quot; - historically established name, read-only memory, ROM)">ROM</abbr> is true for both of them.  So, you can not care about which of these types of memory you have.  But I will tell you about them anyway. <br><br>  <em><abbr title="Memory type based on the logical operation &amp; quot; Not OR &amp; quot; (NOT-OR)">NOR</abbr></em> : faster reading, slower writing. <br>  <em><abbr title="Memory type based on the logical operation &amp; quot; Not AND &amp; quot; (NOT-AND)">NAND</abbr></em> : slower reading, faster writing. <br><br>  This is all relative.  Both types are significantly slower than <abbr title="Random Access Memory (RAM)">RAM</abbr> .  There is one very important difference in these technologies.  <abbr title="Memory type based on the logical operation &amp; quot; Not OR &amp; quot; (NOT-OR)">NOR</abbr> allows you to do something that we call ‚Äúperforming on the spot‚Äù ( <abbr title="eXecutive In Place (&amp; quot; on-site &amp; quot)">XIP</abbr> ).  Remember what we said at the beginning.  To execute a program, you first load it into <abbr title="Random Access Memory (RAM)">RAM</abbr> , and then you execute it from there.  <abbr title="Memory type based on the logical operation &amp; quot; Not OR &amp; quot; (NOT-OR)">NOR</abbr> allows you to execute a program directly from <abbr title="Read-Only Memory (&amp; quot; read-only &amp; quot; - historically established name, read-only memory, ROM)">ROM</abbr> without loading it into <abbr title="Random Access Memory (RAM)">RAM</abbr> in advance.  This means that you can have a system with less <abbr title="Random Access Memory (RAM)">RAM</abbr> .  Notice that this only works for <em>programs</em> .  You cannot "perform on the spot" an image or sound file.  Inability to <abbr title="eXecutive In Place (&amp; quot; on-site &amp; quot)">XIP</abbr> , <abbr title="Memory type based on the logical operation &amp; quot; Not AND &amp; quot; (NOT-AND)">NAND</abbr> compensates for its cost ( <abbr title="Memory type based on the logical operation &amp; quot; Not AND &amp; quot; (NOT-AND)">NAND is</abbr> usually cheaper.) <br><br>  Since <abbr title="Memory type based on the logical operation &amp; quot; Not AND &amp; quot; (NOT-AND)">NAND is</abbr> faster to write, and <abbr title="Memory type based on the logical operation &amp; quot; Not OR &amp; quot; (NOT-OR)">NOR</abbr> to read, the ideal system should have 64MB <abbr title="Memory type based on the logical operation &amp; quot; Not OR &amp; quot; (NOT-OR)">NOR</abbr> and 64MB <abbr title="Memory type based on the logical operation &amp; quot; Not AND &amp; quot; (NOT-AND)">NAND</abbr> .  Then all programs would be stored in the <abbr title="Memory type based on the logical operation &amp; quot; Not OR &amp; quot; (NOT-OR)">NOR</abbr> , and user data would be stored in <abbr title="Memory type based on the logical operation &amp; quot; Not AND &amp; quot; (NOT-AND)">NAND</abbr> .  Since all the programs would be executed ‚Äúon-site‚Äù, there would be no need for 64MB of <abbr title="Random Access Memory (RAM)">RAM</abbr> , which would reduce its volume to 32Mb while saving the precious charge of your battery.  ‚ÄúRunning onsite‚Äù would also mean faster loading of programs, since there would be no need to load the program into <abbr title="Random Access Memory (RAM)">RAM</abbr> before execution.  Such a device would be just a fairy tale! <br><br>  By the way, <abbr title="Secure digital">SD</abbr> and <abbr title="CompactFlash">CF</abbr> memory cards are based on <abbr title="Memory type based on the logical operation &amp; quot; Not AND &amp; quot; (NOT-AND)">NAND</abbr> .  Thus, there is no possibility for ‚Äúexecuting on-site‚Äù the programs stored on them. <br><br>  There is much more that I could tell about, but then it would be a rather long narration.  So, I put the point here. <br><br>  - Related articles: <br><ul><li>  <a href="http://kela.habrahabr.ru/blog/8057.html">Everything you wanted to know about SD ...</a> </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/30945/">https://habr.com/ru/post/30945/</a></p>
