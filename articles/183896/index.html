Non-standard scrolling, parallax, typography - all this is very attractive and pleasing to the eye.  The current designers with the use of modern technologies are able to realize any whim of the customer and their own imagination.  On the other hand, software development tools are developing equally intensively.  Various frameworks, SASSs and other pleasures of life speed up the process and make life easier for programmers and layout designers.  It would seem, live and rejoice, web industry, sparkle with brilliantly ingenious interactivity, push the boundaries of the usual boring world of monotonous sites ...

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  "But" will definitely be.  But at the end :) <br><br>  Many millions of times before me it was said that users go to the Internet for information, that "content is the king" and stuff like that.  It's silly to argue with this: as a rule, we are all interested in information, it is not so important in what form of media it is presented, text, photo or video.  However, the correct content must also be placed in the Procrustean taxonomy bed and divided into correct blocks with the right content, located in the right places and at the right time.  Again, it is necessary to put down tags or something to replace them so that the visitor can group the blocks of content at his own discretion with one or two clicks.  In sum, this can be called "information architecture." <br><br>  In turn, the information architecture is often confused with the fashionable term ‚Äúusability‚Äù, meaning essentially ‚Äúusability‚Äù.  I‚Äôll clarify the term: speaking of usability, most people mean beautifully laid out forms and correct buttons, that is, the visual side of the question, the interface.  We cannot say that usability and information architecture do not overlap, but these are still different things that work for one goal: increasing the speed of working with the system. <br><br>  But the most important thing is that all of the above is not a task, but only the means to solve it. <br><br>  A task exists outside of technology, and, moreover, a task almost always exists in real life.  An example of a correct task: tell a potential buyer about a new FMCG product.  I hope you don‚Äôt need to say that before launching the most wonderful promotional site, this product must first be lowered down the distribution chain, and if we are talking about sales via the Internet, then the entire logistics chain must be prepared.  The promo site in this chain is the first, but far from the most important link. <br><br>  An example of an incorrect task: to make an online store so that the conversion is 20%.  What business, please tell me, do you need a conversion of any level, if after the first attempt of an order the buyer runs to Yandex.Market to write an angry review about the disgusting work of the delivery service?  Moreover, the conversion of primary buyers can really be high ... exactly as long as a wave of angry reviews covers the entire project with a copper basin. <br><br>  It is clear that what is said refers to any reasonable human activity: first understand the task, then choose the method of implementation.  It‚Äôs just that I personally have lately come across too often the fact that even good technical specialists (and sometimes just because they are good specialists) the technological beauty of a solution overshadows the original problem.  Wow, parallax!  Wow, typography!  And on the phone calls, for example, the robot answers, and it‚Äôs impossible to wait for a live operator. <br><br>  So, my opinion: <b>Dao Web Builder - the creation of a really working tool for doing business, and not the satisfaction of their own design or technological ambitions.</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/057/1c9/df1/0571c9df1b2c0ec187aa83f41a709970.png" title="Iceberg web project"><br><br>  There is a great temptation to make a website for some kind of TK, get money, put a job in the portfolio (if it turned out well) and look for the next customer - but this is a road to nowhere.  If the initial task set by the customer requires a different TK, or even in general, it needs a fair change in business processes, the site builder is obliged to indicate this, otherwise there is a serious chance to waste the customer‚Äôs money for nothing.  Moreover, the customer may for a long time acquire immunity to Internet projects, which harms the industry as a whole. <br><br>  Yes, this is a difficult path, which implies a much deeper immersion of a web specialist in the customer's business.  It takes more time, it takes more power, but this is the only way to understand the bottlenecks of this business, to understand the real problems and, thus, to establish more accurate requirements that the web system must meet, and therefore - to create a more advanced website that can really help conduct business. <br><br>  I can guarantee that this way will have to be cut through the customer‚Äôs misunderstanding and other difficulties, but, honestly, the result is worth it, and as a result, the website made will make the world a little better, and not become another technological rattle. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/183896/">https://habr.com/ru/post/183896/</a></p>
