In 1982, he was written by a 15-year-old schoolboy Rich Skrenta for the <strong>Apple II</strong> platform.  It should be noted that the antivirus market, created by the advent of viruses, has become an area in which Russian companies feel no less confident than foreign ones. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The first virus, which appeared in July 1982, was written by a 15-year-old schoolboy Rich Skrenta for the Apple II platform and was classified as bootable.  It spread by infecting the boot sector code of floppy disks for the Apple II operating system.  When the computer was booted, the virus remained in memory and infected all the floppy disks that were inserted into the disk drive. <br><br>  The virus had no malicious manifestations, however, it worked correctly only with diskettes for Apple DOS and could spoil the boot code on diskettes with other systems.  The computers of friends and acquaintances of the author, as well as his math teacher, became victims of the virus. <br><br>  Like many old viruses, Elk Cloner was distinguished by its visual manifestations: at every 50th download, he showed a short poem entitled ‚ÄúElk Cloner: The program with a personality‚Äù: ‚ÄúIt will get you all your disks.  It will infiltrate your chips.  Yes it's Cloner!  It will stick to you like glue.  It will modify RAM too.  Send in the Cloner! ‚Äù(‚Äú Elk Cloner is a unique program. It will penetrate all your disks, filter your chips. Oh yes, this is a Cloner. It will stick to you like glue. The program can change RAM as well. Let Cloner come to you ").

    <img src="http://store.furtaev.ru/habr/apple_ii.jpg" alt="Apple II" title="The first virus was written for Apple II"><br><br>  ‚ÄúA lot of time has passed since the appearance of the first virus, and at the same time this‚Äú battle of the shield and sword ‚Äùbegan between the developers of viruses and antiviruses, - says Alexey Dolya, head of the Analytical Center of InfoWatch.  - The market for antivirus products has turned into a multi-billion dollar industry.  Of particular interest is the fact that the antivirus market is one of the few markets in which Russian developers feel even more confident than foreign ones. ‚Äù <br><br>  Interestingly, the first antivirus is not much younger than its enemy - only by two years.  In 1984, the programmer Andy Hopkins (Andy Hopkins) wrote the utilities CHK4BOMB and BOMBSQAD, which allowed intercepting some operations performed through the BIOS, as well as analyzing the boot module, which made it possible to deal with some types of viruses of that time. <br><br>  <strong>Source</strong> - <a href="http://www.cnews.ru/news/top/index.shtml%3F2007/07/17/259126" title="Original article">CNews</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/12349/">https://habr.com/ru/post/12349/</a></p>
