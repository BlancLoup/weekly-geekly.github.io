  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Svyaznoy - business in Russian!</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  My girlfriend ordered a phone through Svyaznoy's online store, as a gift to mom on NG.  On the same day, the staff of the messenger called and said that the next day the phone would be delivered free of charge at a convenient address. <br><br>  The ‚Äúnext day‚Äù comes, and the morning begins with a call from the contact that they cannot deliver the goods today, but only on January 2 or 3!  I wonder if someone needs a phone after NG as a gift? <br>  As an alternative offered to drive up to their warehouse itself !!!  and pick up the phone from there.  Because  the girl had no time to travel to this godforsaken warehouse; I went there.  When I came to the "warehouse", it was also the training center of the company.  In the lobby in front of the reception were 30-40 people.  At first I had a feeling that I didn‚Äôt get there, and these people are waiting for refresher courses ... <br>  But after talking with one guy, I realized that everyone here is with the same purpose as I would pick up my goods, which this office promised to deliver itself ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Trying to understand the principle of issuing goods, talked with people standing nearby.  It turns out you must inform the employee at the reception number of your order.  She will inform him by phone in the recruitment department, and after he has been staffed, they will bring him to one of the rooms near the reception desk, where he will be given to me. <br><br>  Realizing that I was one of more than 30 people, I sat down on the sofa and began to watch.  (and the people all approached and approached, with the same desire to receive their goods).  And the staff who complete the product work amazing, every 15 minutes they go down from the department of formation and bring 2-3 phones, no more !!!  As a result, you can estimate that in an hour they will release no more than 12 people.

      Here is such a history of the work of a coherent.  At the same time watching this picture, I was struck by the attitude of employees to customers.  Yes, I certainly understand that those employees who were present there are not to blame for the problems of the entire liaison.  But at the same time not one employee has never apologized to the client for the failure with delivery.  That's right, people now have their heads ‚Äúaround‚Äù from whom and what to donate, so not everyone is ready to ‚Äúreplay‚Äù their plans.  And she uses this connection.  Only here the reputation of the company after this New Year's Eve week will be ‚Äúbelow the plinth‚Äù. <br><br>  I used to always have a positive attitude towards this company.  He bought his phones from them and advised them to his friends.  But after everything I saw today, I realized that the coherent - sharaga. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/79750/">https://habr.com/ru/post/79750/</a></p>
