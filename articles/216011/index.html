  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Smartwatch Sony Smartwatch 2 SW2</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Despite the fact that wristwatches are now viewed more as a decoration, and not as a device for measuring time, I would rather leave the house without a mobile phone than without a watch.  I got used to them.  By the time I have small requirements - analog dial, date display, water resistance (so that you can wash your hands), backlight.  A nice, but not mandatory bonus is the digital dial. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/10f/c4d/43b/10fc4d43b4eb3e73395c4bba46f83500.jpg" alt="OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA" width="531" height="480"><br><br>  Until recently, I had inexpensive Casio, which, in principle, arranged for everyone.  There was only one drawback - hurry.  Somewhere for a minute per month.  If they lagged behind, it would not be so annoying - from time to time it is easy to translate forward for a minute.  But in order to translate a minute ago, the analog clock had to be rewound 11 hours 59 minutes ahead - the hands did not move back.  So the idea arose to buy a clock with time synchronization. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  At first I looked in the direction of radio synchronization.  It did not work out - the towers are in Europe, they only hook Russia on the borders.  Plus any time transfers for winter / summer. <br>  Sync via GPS?  Overweight.  It‚Äôs better to have a GPS logger while wearing a watch. <br>  Watch phone?  Just bust.  A toy for a couple of hours, then throw on the shelf and no longer reach.  How the clock works half a day, how the phone is useless at all.  Yes, and talk to the clock ... It's not mine, in general.  :)

      Sync with phone via bluetooth?  The very thing. <br>  Went to look at Casio.  <strong>GB-6900B</strong> - there is no analog dial, cost 6500 - if ordered on ebay and 9500 - if you buy from us.  They synchronize, scream, if a letter or SMS arrives, control the player, work for two years from one battery (when using bluetooth).  Recorded in the candidates.  But nevertheless, the analog dial wanted, it seems to me much more comfortable than the digital one.  Because I went to watch alternatives. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/93e/8b3/684/93e8b368411bb793dfb3e2b2e1dbd17a.jpg" alt="002" width="300" height="370"><br><br>  <strong>Citizen Eco-Drive Proximity</strong> .  Analog.  Beautiful.  Only mail and incoming calls are reported by waving the arrow.  Work only with iphone.  Sorry, but not good. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fa4/4ed/6b4/fa44ed6b4e90afad26017b682c3468a6.jpg" alt="003" width="400" height="267"><br><br>  <strong>Cookoo Watch</strong> .  Analog, not as beautiful as Proximity (although also pretty cute), do not display the date.  Refuse. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b1b/25a/393/b1b25a393773d4b917193805becaf037.jpg" alt="004" width="400" height="241"><br><br>  Somewhere at this stage I wanted to control the player from the clock (useful when using a wired headset), to see who is calling (and not just having a call).  Well, make calls from the clock - so as not to get the phone when using the headset. <br><br>  <strong>Samsung Galaxy Gear</strong> .  Big, expensive, too heaped up, work day, work only with Samsung.  No good <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e0c/db2/283/e0cdb22833c2b11068491ea9b788ecc5.jpg" alt="005" width="400" height="300"><br><br>  <strong>Sony Smartwatch</strong> - the cheapest option, but it hurts too much toy.  And the time is not much longer than the Galaxy Gear.  Plus, all these tapping on the screen to display the time ... Absolutely stupid thing. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ac7/644/fcd/ac7644fcdfb844c1f6f6d16e51ef55a8.jpg" alt="006" width="388" height="300"><br><br>  <strong>Pebble</strong>  Interesting.  Work long enough for this class of devices.  A bunch of different dials and all sorts of indications (mail, SMS, weather, coordinates, speed ...). <br>  In shortcomings: <br>  - Design.  Not liked, too much like a simple Chinese watch.  Maybe when meeting live, I would change my opinion, but they did not meet me in stores.  Fixed in <strong>Pebble Steel</strong> . <br>  - Own connector for connecting the charger.  And I somehow got used to that everything around through microUSB is charging. <br>  - Russian language.  Fixed in alternative firmware. <br>  - Control of three buttons.  For dialing or searching it in the phone book, it is much less convenient than a touchscreen. <br>  Pebble: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/81c/5c5/813/81c5c5813e7b55257b41e4db9e3b229b.png" alt="007" width="400" height="300"><br>  Pebble Steel: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6e0/cdd/e8b/6e0cdde8b430f8a541a14f40eeae0459.png" alt="steel-black-front-400-adbdf2130bffcf43a287c439a291b3d7" width="300" height="400"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9d7/e56/771/9d7e56771e566d28b52d6225ab0dbf00.png" alt="steel-silver-front-400-557b315e2898d32cee532579c556d784" width="300" height="400"><br><br>  Well, the winner of the race - <strong>Sony Smartwatch 2</strong> .  Compared to the first version, they have become much less toy-like, now they are more like a watch and support the use of ordinary straps.  More details below. <br><br><h5>  Specifications </h5><br>  Pretty mean: <br>  Touchscreen display 1.6 ‚Ä≥, 220 √ó 176, 176 ppi <br>  Bluetooth 3.0 <br>  NFC <br>  Compliance with IP57 protection standard (dustproof, withstand short-term immersion to a depth of 1 m). <br>  Compatible with any smartphones based on Android 4.0 <br>  Dimensions 42 √ó 41 √ó 9 mm <br>  Weight 46 g <br><br>  Neither you use the processor, nor the size of the RAM ... But this is still a clock, not a phone.  ;) <br>  The dynamics in the clock is not, so they are dumb.  But there is a strong enough vibrating signal. <br>  Design - the current Sony style.  Black, square, side button.  Not to say that it is particularly beautiful, but not a plastic remnant. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/25e/f1b/a80/25ef1ba80ace50d26cd200ff7084d34f.jpg" alt="008" width="400" height="265"><br><br>  On the complete silicone / rubber strap a lot of complaints in terms of life expectancy, but with a metal strap we don‚Äôt sell these watches.  But the mount is standard - so you can put any straps 24mm wide. <br>  I lick on something like this, but for now the toad is choking. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5a5/f18/2a4/5a5f182a43329b44d0a743f54a2ddfda.jpg" alt="009" width="640" height="210"><br><br><h5>  Without a phone, the watch has the following functionality: </h5><br>  Time display: 10 preset dials, two thirds of which are displays of each other in black and white. <br>  Alarm clock: Two alarms, set the alarm on days of the week and the alarm duration (10, 15, 30 seconds).  Signal vibro. <br>  Stopwatch: Cut off circles, display the icon of the shortest circle. <br>  Timer: until 23:59:59. <br>  Plus settings and completely stupid flashlight application - just fills the screen with white color. <br><br><h5>  Screen and control </h5><br>  Touch screen  Below it are three touch buttons in the android style - Back, Home and Menu. <br>  On the side - a round silver button, similar to the ones that Sony uses in its smartphones.  The first press turns on the backlight, the second one goes to the program list, the third one returns to the standby mode.  In the list of programs, the movement occurs with right-to-left swipe. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ff4/258/3b7/ff42583b7e3500eb9759ff4f08abd9e0.jpg" alt="OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA" width="532" height="480"><br><br>  In standby mode, the backlight is turned off, the selected dial is displayed, the screen does not react to anything. <br>  The screen at the watch is transflective, therefore, with the backlight turned off with external illumination, the image is perfectly visible.  And the brighter it is, the better it can be seen.  The disadvantage of this screen is the graininess of the image. <br><br><h5>  Used programs </h5><br>  There are quite a few programs for watches in the market, but I use less than a dozen. <br>  <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.sonyericsson.extras.liveware.extension.gmail">Gmail</a> - mail notification, the ability to read a text letter.  When a letter arrives, it vibrates and displays several lines.  If at this time to click on the screen, it will try to download the entire letter (without images and attachments).  It works well, but with some Russian-language problem headers, it displays a type of porridge "=? KOI8-R? B? PT9LT0k ...", while the text itself displays normally.  There are no such problems with letters in utf-8.  At normal start displays a few recent letters. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/100/624/b62/100624b6239a45a97e52d4fb751b0efe.png" alt="011" width="308" height="300"><br><br>  <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.sonyericsson.extras.liveware.extension.messaging">Messages</a> - alerts on incoming messages.  Works the same as Gmail. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ae7/a81/ae1/ae7a81ae14eb1e9c2cdd8675e562ea8c.png" alt="012" width="312" height="300"><br><br>  <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.sonyericsson.extras.liveware.extension.call">Call management</a> - when a call comes in, we show the name and number of the caller (whether the photo shows - I don‚Äôt know, I don‚Äôt have any photos in the address book), allows you to take a call, reject a call, reject with a message from the list of pre-installed ones or just turn off the sound on your phone in hours).  When launched, it allows you to make a call from the list of favorite numbers, from the list of recent calls, from the phone's address book, or simply by typing the number in digits.  The disadvantage is that sorting is done by the name of subscribers, and not by last name.  But still, the program is very convenient when using a headset (which is wired, which is wireless). <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/409/44b/35a/40944b35a554e1672679ba059925d037.png" alt="013.1" width="321" height="300"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f48/8ce/6e4/f488ce6e49c0d351a3b6e6a516a38ff9.jpg" alt="OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA" width="258" height="240"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b5d/447/4fd/b5d4474fd82501bf684d3741a02c6db9.jpg" alt="OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA" width="275" height="240"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/097/149/8e9/0971498e96dad6b24f1a2eca83563de2.jpg" alt="OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA" width="249" height="240"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/045/322/941/045322941efc49ddeeadf8bcc286fa7a.jpg" alt="OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA" width="262" height="240"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/869/560/f9a/869560f9ae2ff411a0f4ebdba0871551.png" alt="013.6" width="300" height="302"><br><br>  Missed calls - just a list of missed calls. <br><br>  <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.sonyericsson.extras.liveware.extension.music">Music player</a> - shows the title and the cover of the current song when it starts up, allows you to change the volume, switch tracks, pause.  And everything, perhaps.  While using with a bluetooth headset it is useless, but useful when using ordinary headphones.  Works with any player (I have - n7player) <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/736/21a/3cb/73621a3cb6910da1143667b3dced8a0e.png" alt="014" width="316" height="300"><br><br>  <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.sonyericsson.extras.liveware.extension.calendar.control">Calendar</a> - displays upcoming diary events.  No alerts - they already come by SMS and mail. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c68/017/e39/c68017e39e6dfd9a19c9ca0bfe10a60d.png" alt="015" width="320" height="300"><br><br>  <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.sonyericsson.extras.liveware.extension.weather">Weather</a> is more a toy than a useful application.  At the start, it displays the weather for today and the next three days in the place specified in the settings.  The pictures are the first smartwatch, but the application itself has not changed, it looks the same. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0e6/a8d/e53/0e6a8de53c4bf76f8671f3f2f2d7a120.jpg" alt="016.1" width="304" height="300"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2ad/bee/150/2adbee1507d28d604f2813835162f74f.jpg" alt="016.2" width="313" height="300"><br><br>  <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dde.bytewiese.smartwatch2.gpsmap2">GPS map</a> ‚Äî receives the coordinates from the phone‚Äôs GPS receiver and displays them on the OpenStreetMap map.  Also fun, but useless toy.  The battery of the clock is eating like not in itself. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/61d/487/788/61d487788f196f6d038f7781ee02fde2.png" alt="017" width="269" height="252"><br><br>  From what I do not use, but you should pay attention: <br>  <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dnet.nefastudio.android.smartwatch2.nfappwidget">Remote Widget</a> - display almost any android widgets on the clock screen.  Only it is necessary to take into account the fact that the more often the data is transmitted to the watch, the faster their battery sets. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/94a/9a4/165/94a9a4165bb7432872166756f33198fc.png" alt="018" width="384" height="640"><br><br>  <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.sonyericsson.extras.liveware.extension.toggles49">Toggles</a> - enable or disable various phone functions (wifi, sound, gps, data transfer, etc.) and display the battery level, cellular signal and a list of available wireless networks. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0c0/e3f/cce/0c0e3fcce38e800f5b6666ae7cce649a.png" alt="019" width="318" height="300"><br><br>  In general, there are more than two hundred applications for watches in the market: <a href="https://play.google.com/store/search%3Fq%3DSmartWatch2%26c%3Dapps">https://play.google.com/store/search?q=SmartWatch2&amp;c=apps</a> <br><br><h5>  Working hours </h5><br>  With my usual mode of use, the clock works for about five to six days, if not turned off for the night.  Of course, not two years, but once a week I am ready to charge my watch.  Although, I think it can be averaged that the clock works for four days. <br>  But on the phone work with the clock affects more seriously.  If I usually had a battery for 10-15 percent per day, then with the connected clock, 30-35% of the charge flies away per day.  Not deadly, I still put the phone in the cradle every evening, but I must take it into account.  Although the external battery is still in your pocket anyway, it will feed the phone and the watch - the benefit of the charging connector is the same. <br><br><h5>  Small notes </h5><br>  Normally works simultaneously with the Bluetooth headset. <br>  Some delay in triggering notifications - first the phone, after a second to a friend - the clock. <br>  Reconnect without problems, the time of connection and disconnection is marked vibra.  If during the shutdown some missed events appeared on the phone, then the vibration also works.  But once.  Can be confused with vibration when reconnecting. <br>  The maximum range of work depends on the walls, through two supporting walls they no longer finish off. <br>  Sometimes they freeze and stop responding to events - with this control of calls or the player works.  It is treated by rebooting the clock. <br>  The list of preset dials is not editable.  But additional dials are still there, they are implemented through the installation of programs, like <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.sonyericsson.extras.liveware.extension.clockisw2">Clocki</a> or <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dnet.nefastudio.android.smartwatch2.nfwatchfaces">WatchFaces</a> .  I haven‚Äôt seriously dealt with them myself yet, so I won‚Äôt say how much they affect the hours of work. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bfa/1cb/40e/bfa1cb40e6731766313ee292a1e293c6.png" alt="020.1" width="390" height="640"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/821/b23/da7/821b23da7ae06081d6f00781978d7e35.png" alt="020.2" width="360" height="640"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e98/768/d6e/e98768d6e360de5d92705fcb2c2eb7e1.png" alt="020.3" width="384" height="640"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/dac/bf8/77e/dacbf877e2ce4fe4476dbf68bdd2a33d.png" alt="020.4" width="384" height="640"><br><br><h5>  Total </h5><br>  In my opinion, Sony Smartwatch 2 is currently the best option among all smart watches.  Convenient to use, decent running time, work normally without a phone, waterproof, standard charging connector, connect to any smartphone.  If you take today - then they are.  Or pebble.  And if not today, then wait and see what Apple and Google will show. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/216011/">https://habr.com/ru/post/216011/</a></p>
