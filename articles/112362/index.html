  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Google tightens methods to combat search spam</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/52753527/0091622f/312d1c96/ea79c5ee.jpg"><br><br>  The fight against unscrupulous SEO is conducted by search engines for many years.  Nevertheless, despite all the attempts of search services to eliminate empty websites that go to the top only thanks to the ‚Äúblack‚Äù methods of search optimization, there are still quite a few similar websites.  The other day, Matt Kats, head of the anti-search spam department at Google, announced the introduction of new methods to combat search spam, much more reliable than before.  It is clear that sooner or later all kinds of ‚Äúoptimizers‚Äù will find a way out of the situation, but, according to Kats, it will not happen soon. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  Google is going to fight not only with the so-called ‚Äúdoorways‚Äù and other garbage, but also with the usual sites (the same online stores) that violate the rules of the search service.  In principle, many of us have heard of an online store of sunglasses, which has been in the top for many years due to negative customer reviews.  It is clear that in addition to the owner of this online store, who was only pleased with this effect, many SEO specialists abused and abused the ‚Äúblack‚Äù methods of promoting resources on the web.  It is with such figures, or rather, with their products artificially promoted in search results, that the search engine is going to fight.  This is a war ‚Äúfor life and death‚Äù.

        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

      <br>
      For example, Google has learned to recognize automatic comments left by various scripts (which, in turn, are used by SEOs themselves for their resources) in order to promote websites in search engine results.  In addition, the "radically improved" method by which the search engine will now be able to identify normal sites that have been hacked.  This method was introduced not so long ago, and showed good results, well, and now, according to the developers, it has been made much more perfect. <br><br>  By the way, Google introduced another way of dealing with low-quality sites - a filter that lowered sites with duplicated (copied) content in search results, has undergone significant changes, and now copyright-free sites are waiting for an unenviable fate.  In any case, I want to hope so. <br><br>  Kats also stressed that websites that violate Google‚Äôs rules, and which have Google AdSense contextual advertising on their pages, have no advantages over similar sites without AdSense ads.  This is probably a direct allusion to the so-called doorways.  True, this is somehow hard to believe - the struggle has been going on for a long time, and so far there has not been much success in this fight. <br><br>  Well, I would like to hope that the new methods of dealing with web spam will become a truly reliable tool for clearing the web of garbage.  Recently, Habr√© has already published news that, according to analysts, in five years the Internet will simply ‚Äúdrown‚Äù in a huge number of garbage sites, which are becoming more and more.  One would like to hope that this forecast will not become a reality. <br><br>  Via <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20110121/tc_afp/usitcrimesoftwareinternetgoogle%3B_ylt%3DAv5wfbKnkQiVsjVUzcwPTyH6VbIF%3B_ylu%3DX3oDMTM3cWVtOG8xBGFzc2V0A2FmcC8yMDExMDEyMS91c2l0Y3JpbWVzb2Z0d2FyZWludGVybmV0Z29vZ2xlBHBvcwMzMQRzZWMDeW5fcGFnaW5hdGVfc3VtbWFyeV9saXN0BHNsawNnb29nbGV0YXJnZXQ-">yahoo</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/112362/">https://habr.com/ru/post/112362/</a></p>
