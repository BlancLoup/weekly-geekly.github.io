      In each chapter, we describe the traditional implementation of the pattern and then show how to implement it using the Java EE platform oriented semantics. <br><br>  We use complete code samples to demonstrate both the traditional implementation and the implementation for the Java EE platform, and we supplement each chapter with examples from practice that demonstrate the correct (and erroneous) use of patterns.  We explore the pros and cons of each pattern and study their areas of application.  At the end of each chapter are exercises to test your understanding of this pattern in Java EE. <br><br><h5>  Who is this book for? </h5><br>  This book is for everyone, regardless of experience level.  It covers almost all of the information about patterns, starting with how they are described in other books, to simple Java implementation code, Java EE implementation and, finally, to practical examples: how and when to use a particular pattern.  It also has real-life stories that discuss successful and unsuccessful patterns. <br><br>  Useful knowledge of the design patterns and the Java EE platform will be helpful when reading the book.  If you have already dealt with patterns and basic implementations in the Java language, you can go directly to the implementations for Java EE.  However, it may be useful to refresh your memory and knowledge of design patterns. <br><br><h5>  What does this book cover? </h5><br>  This book covers all the classic design patterns offered by the Java EE platform as part of the standard implementation, as well as some new patterns.  The coverage starts with Java EE 5 and includes the latest version of the platform currently available - Java EE 7. We hope that this publication will become a reference book that will permanently settle on your bookshelf. <br><br><h5>  How this book is structured </h5><br>  Each chapter is focused on one design pattern.  If the pattern is classic, then after explaining its essence, a simple implementation in the Java language is given.  Each chapter offers practice stories illustrating the pattern on which the chapter is focused, positive or negative real-life examples.  The history from practice is followed by the implementation on the Java EE platform, an example and an explanation.  Each sample code can be run separately from the others.  Finally, each chapter ends with a description of where and how to effectively use this pattern. <br><br><h5>  About the authors </h5><br>  <b>Murat Yener</b> is a programming fanatic and open source software committer;  currently a developer for the Android platform in the division of Intel New Devices Group.
