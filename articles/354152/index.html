Revising all presentations of the speakers is a thankless task, so for the readers of Habr the robots chose the most interesting ones.  Details under the cut. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/y2/uz/km/y2uzkmj9q9ut6qen8h4suonpxgw.png" alt="image">  <b>Anton Polyakov, iOS developer:</b> <br><br>  - At the conference there were two types of reports: engineering and "smoothies" - for those who are not in the subject.  In general, there were no revelations. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"

          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"

      <br>
      For example, there was an interesting report about reverse engineering, but if I were involved in this topic, there would be nothing new in the report for me. <br><br>  Separately, it is worth noting the level of speakers - it is felt that this was paid attention to and spent time rehearsing reports.  It was nice to listen to foreign speakers, for example, from Google. <br><br>  I would put a monument to the organizers.  Except for the only shoal with a non-working projector, everything was very cool and thoughtful.  Half-hour breaks between the reports allowed to talk, digest all the information received and as a result did not feel overloaded after 8 hours of the conference.  What is often lacking and why they come to the conference is an opportunity to talk with the developers and ask questions that I did not manage to formulate or ask after the report itself. <br><br>  If you do not know how to write code, you will not learn this at the conference.  But for developers it is useful to get an insight into topics that they have not encountered in their work, and to understand where to dig if necessary. <br><br>  At the conference, in principle, go for communication and experience, which is not read anywhere.  Therefore, it is always interesting to hear reports on how the development automation processes in companies are arranged - for example, this was the Avito report.  It would be good to get his record, to review at home and analyze how similar it is or not to our experience. <br><br><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/a3/r3/ez/a3r3ezzac3v85klmmii_yhx2txg.png" alt="image">  <b>Kirill Kochnev, Android developer:</b> <br><br>  - In my opinion, the most interesting was the report by Anton Dudakov from Yandex. Auto about the insides of the Android OS - there were moments in it that are very difficult or impossible to find in the documentation.  In particular, an interesting case, when the application crashes and a standard dialog appears.  The default behavior can be changed by setting your own default killApplicationHandler and changing the exit logic from the application.  It is also useful about how the system allows you to increase the priority of the application while it is in the background, and when it is double, Receiver Ban is triggered.  In general, I strongly recommend for viewing. <br><br>  The report of Andrei Breslav about Kotlin, I believe, is obliged to see everything - in order to finally stop the debate about who stole what.  To copy successful solutions of other languages ‚Äã‚Äãand correct bad ones is good and correct.  That's why Kotlin turned out to be interesting, because it absorbed many successful cases. <br><br>  Here are a couple of borrowed solutions: <br><br>  1) removed the word new when creating an object - like in Python; <br>  2) removed the words implements extends, extension functions (but with a much more pleasant syntax) - like with C #; <br>  3) val, var, companion object, type on the right - like Scala; <br><br>  Alexey Shpirko from Avito told how their Continuous Delivery works.  It looks, of course, very impressive.  Git is associated with Jira.  For example, if the feature in Jira is not closed, then the build will not be delivered with this feature - and all this becomes clear automatically.  Implemented the ability to build release builds by disabling certain features, which, in my opinion, is just great.  An interesting idea that it is useful for teams to create a so-called release policy and stick to it. <br><br>  In general, the impressions of the conference are very positive.  There were several strong reports on complex things, as well as interesting philosophical topics.  Of the minuses, I would note the BoF-session - but, perhaps, this is a particular format. <br><br><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/sw/xn/u3/swxnu3tljnwk7ekrgdn1sldpgue.png" alt="image">  <b>Svetoslav Karasev, iOS developer:</b> <br><br>  - Firstly, Mobius is a great experience, interesting reports, wonderful people.  Not all speeches met expectations - Felix Krause‚Äôs ‚ÄúTrusting iOS SDKs‚Äù report was a bit disappointing, which tells you that you can be subjected to an MITM attack when you pull http dependencies into your project.  I wanted to hear about less obvious and more likely dangers when using third-party libraries.  During the report for some reason, I remembered the "Hacker in the dining room." <br><br>  Strong, energetic and memorable was the story of Andrei Breslav from JetBrains about what, how and from where was borrowed when developing Kotlin.  Also worth a look is the recording of the report of Evgeny Suvorov on the modularization of mobile applications, very entertaining. <br><br><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/_i/jx/i8/_ijxi8p2enebpjqxfv0ixy7rbxw.png" alt="image">  <b>Ivan Vavilov, iOS Team Lead:</b> <br><br>  - In general, the level of the community and presentations at conferences is growing - if earlier they could discuss how to create a class correctly, now they are talking about really complex and interesting things.  For example, the developers of ‚ÄúMamba‚Äù made a report - they combined the development of the application with the concept of the playground.  Developers write components in the playground that are used in the application and immediately see how animations work, for example.  It is interesting that, even now this topic is not very popular, the Alfa-Bank team recently spoke about this on its mitap.  The developers of "Mamba" began to use this technology a year ago, and now they already have a fairly large set of components that are testing this way. <br><br>  Developers who write on Kotlin generally had a unique opportunity to talk to one of the creators of the language.  The guys just got lucky that JetBrains in St. Petersburg - we write in Swift, and it‚Äôs not so easy to talk to its developers. <br><br>  <b>Instead of conclusion</b> <br><br>  Mobile development, on the one hand, is developing at a tremendous speed, on the other, it has become as complex and voluminous as the other areas.  Each developer can deeply understand a certain part that he is digging himself, but it is incredibly difficult to keep up with everything at once.  Such well-prepared conferences like Mobius help to learn a lot of details from different teams and advance in solving their own problems. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/354152/">https://habr.com/ru/post/354152/</a></p>
