Brakes remained. <br>  Finally, recently, we moved to a good dedicated server with SAS disks. <br>  The site began to fly, and the expense of finance, you will not believe the same as on Claudo! <br>  Also, to reduce the load on the disk, we stopped storing more than 1000 files in one folder. <br>  For example, a month ago, a folder with avatars contained more than 140 thousand pictures! <br>  In general, it used to be <b>/ava/2034.jpg</b> , now it has become <b>/ava/2/034.jpg</b> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>About increasing functionality</b> <br>  We started as a service of anonymous comments. <br>  Easy registration, no extra information - you get a page and throw it in the social.  network. <br>  The service was just an addition to social networks.  You could even say a toy.

      Then we added blogs and photos.  It's so great when all the familiar people can talk without masks about your personality, appearance, and your <i>brilliant</i> blog posts. <br>  Criticism helps us to become better. <br>  For the first month, users wrote 4,000 blog entries and uploaded 11,000 photos (piece loading, 30 user limit per user). <br><br>  And as soon as we launched friends and messages, 1500 social contacts (friend postings) were recorded on the site within 24 hours!  Page views increased by 30%. <br>  By default, friends are hidden.  You can add no more than 100 friends. <br><br>  <b>About messaging system</b> <br>  In early May, we began to develop a system of conversations with the possibility of adding up to 7 friends. <br>  What was our surprise when VKontakte announced a similar function on June 2nd. <br>  Moreover, they launched it in the middle of May, just announced later. <br>  I had a shock.  4 years did not move, and here as soon as we started it, they start. <br>  Redesigning the architecture was already expensive and we still launched our system of group conversations. <br>  Powered by files.  This is something similar to leproinbox, only in a more nimble version. <br><br>  We also added this ajax-panel, which turns green when there are new messages. <br><img src="http://shaida.biz/panelgreen.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>About competition</b> <br>  When we first started, I, of course, was afraid of the emergence of direct competitors. <br>  Services of anonymous questions already existed, but we launched the service of anonymous opinions first. <br>  Surprisingly, during these 5 months no one has created a service similar to ours. <br>  There are new services anonymous questions.  There are <a href="http://trislovamne.ru/">clones of</a> <a href="http://threewords.me/">foreign services</a> . <br>  And in a niche of anonymous opinions, no one climbs.  It turns out that there is competition, but inferior. <br>  It's a pity.  Competitors - this is one of the best incentives to help develop quality. <br><br>  <b>Growth chart</b> <br><img src="http://shaida.biz/upstat.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Hey gay, we did it!  In less than six months we have done a popular project, which <br>  <a href="http://www.liveinternet.ru/rating/ru/meeting/">already included in the top thirty most visited projects on this topic in runet</a> . <br><br>  Now I am not ashamed to invite you to <a href="http://nekto.me/">join</a> ,%% username. <br><br>  PS <a href="http://nekto.me/Mark_TSukerberg">He is waiting for your opinions</a> ! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/122176/">https://habr.com/ru/post/122176/</a></p>
