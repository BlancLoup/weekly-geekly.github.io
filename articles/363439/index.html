Did you have to pay extra for extra weight at check-in because you simply did not have time to weigh your luggage before departure?  Do you know any unpleasant situations with lightning, wheels and other telescopic handles? <br><br>  It seems that at some point all these problems with luggage just got the guys from the New York-based <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/trunkster/trunkster-zipperless-luggage-with-gps-battery-scal">startup project Trunkster</a> , who decided to create a reference sample of a modern suitcase - utilitarian, durable and stylish. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/645/639/373/645639373e814be6a65e94ea037113b5.gif">

    <a name="habracut"></a><br>  And most importantly, however, not to say that this is so unexpected - there are not so few people with similar problems, as well as the amount of the fund they provide: more than 650 backers and more than $ 230,000 of investment (this is with the stated goal of $ 50,000 !) <br><br>  But what did the former backpackers buy when they decided to trade their rumpled backpacks for this miracle of design and engineering? <br><br>  The project presents two types of luggage - Carry-On and Cheked with a capacity of 43 and 86 liters, respectively.  The supporting structure and side walls are made of durable and lightweight aircraft-grade aluminum.  But the access system inside the baggage is truly revolutionary and made on the principle of sliding curtains of hard and hard polycarbonate, frosted black. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8ed/23e/c0a/8ed23ec0ad9d4e9bba85636558f8b699.jpg"><br><br>  By the way, in order to help all lovers or, rather, lovers cram everything into their luggage, they have developed a special ‚Äútamping‚Äù mechanism, combined with a closing panel. <br><br>  The emphasis on lovers of traveling with a small luggage is not accidental - the startup emphasizes the versatility of their suitcases.  And the marketing strategy of the project is the same backpack, only more reliable, more capacious, more functional and stylish - it finds its bright embodiment in the key details of the product. <br><br>  Rigid telescopic handle on the entire width of the suitcase - remember how often you yourself suffered with narrow handles and trying to turn over the luggage. <br><br>  Practical wheels with ceramic bearings and a working surface made of the newest rubber compound - asphalt, paving stones, paving slabs and even steps will not cause them any harm. <br><br>  Well, so that all these performance characteristics do not remain a proto-declaration, the founders of a startup - a full exclusive among all projects on Kickstarter, provide a 5-year warranty for both their models.  Any more questions? <br><br>  Probably not.  But there are additional chips in Trunkster suitcases that make them the absolute exclusive in the luggage market. <br><br>  So, in order. <br><br>  First, the display built into the handle at the moment of lifting the suitcase shows its weight - now you will not have problems registering, you can distribute things in advance: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6bb/c33/aec/6bbc33aec4924e05bbb95a7667a19f95.jpg"><br><br>  Secondly, a battery is built into the suitcase, on a single charge of which you can charge your phone up to 9 times - now there are no throwings around the airport building and the streets of an unfamiliar city with the extended wire in your hand: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5b6/1ca/fed/5b61cafeda5740e6a24267753fb5b61f.jpg"><br><br>  Well, maybe the most important thing - from a value point of view, for sure - is an additional GPS sensor (+40 $), which functions on the Apple Find My Mac principle.  That is, in extreme cases, at least you will find a suitcase. <br><br>  Which, by the way, is not bad in itself, considering how much this miracle costs, more precisely, it will cost after the completion of funding.  Namely: Carry-On - $ 500, Cheked - $ 600. However, if you invest now with a delivery date in August 2015, the prices will be $ 255 and $ 295, respectively. <br><br>  The weight of the suitcase version of the Carry-On is approximately 3.5 kg, with packaging it will pull approximately 4.2 kg.  With <a href="https://litemf.com/">LiteMF</a> it can be sent to Moscow for $ 59. <br><br> <a href="http://litemf.com/ru/price"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/521/d7d/506/521d7d506c53477494e0b40d66252dba.png"></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/363439/">https://habr.com/ru/post/363439/</a></p>
