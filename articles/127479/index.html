      Transactions are faster and more secure than at BTC.  If you have ever used Bitcoins, you know that sometimes sending them can take many hours.  In 2011, businesses and users expect much greater speed.  They do not want to tell their customers "you need to wait 12 hours and the payment will pass." <br><br>  2 - Security <br><br>  Many people are not aware that BTC are vulnerable to a sharp drop in the power of miners, which for example has recently caused the collapse of IXCoin, and before that NameCoin.  People who own IXCoin with extreme difficulty can now transfer them to somewhere.  Bitcoin have exactly the same vulnerability - if too many miners simultaneously fail (for example, to extract SolidCoin) the entire network falls into a coma and the next recalculation of complexity will have to wait for an unknown time. <br><br>  The new smart algorithm SolidCoin makes sure that even if many miners fall down - the complexity quickly (recalculated 2 times a day) adapts and the network will continue to work just as steadily.  This is exactly what business and users want, maximum stability and uninterrupted ability to translate coins. <br><br>  3 - We make everything simple (They just work) <br><br>  Unlike Bitcoin developers, we have developed commercial sites that use BTC as currency for our users.  There are a lot of potential vulnerabilities that could lead to new installations like MyBitcoin.  Online currency reputation is the top priority if every second day there is a successful hack of sites that use Bitcoins - how can they enter the mainstream? <br><br>  Why do you have to be a computer veteran with 20 years of experience in order to use BTC correctly and safely?  SolidCoin has already improved the API by making it more similar to the modern banking system, and subsequent updates will make the ability to integrate SolidCoin into the business much easier and more understandable. <br><br>  4 - Justice <br><br>  During the first 48 hours after the launch of SolidCoin, more than 2,000 people became currency owners.  A week later, 10,000. Unlike the launch of Bitcoin, when most of the currency was in the hands of units.  These people then sold their BTC and left the project with almost no support. <br><br>  SolidCoin on the other hand has thousands of supporters interested in the success of Internet currencies, many of whom donated their coins to the prize pool.  We learned from Bitcoin errors and created a better and fairer system for the world, combined with a faster and smarter network. <br><br>  5 - Plans for the future <br><br>  Bitcoin developers seem to have no clear direction.  Development is stagnant and trying to pull it in different directions.  Recently, one of the main developers announced the possibility that the Bitcoin network will be managed by Bank of America.  One of the worst banks, as shown by the Financial Crisis, will manage the decentralized Internet currency?  Would you like to support something like that? <br><br>  We know that people want an easy-to-use decentralized Internet currency that does not depend on existing banks.  We know that people want to pay low transfer fees.  We know that people want the fastest possible translations.  We know how to scale a network safely then when it reaches the scale of a Visa / Mastercard network.  If you agree with all this, you understand that SolidCoins has a bright future.  We are not afraid to put our goals on public display. <br><br>  The text is, of course, a little too advertising, but in many respects fair - from the BTC clones I currently know, SolidCoin is perhaps the most promising indeed.  It‚Äôs a pity that they didn‚Äôt have time to add Merged Mining to themselves - in my opinion, it‚Äôs the future.  =) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/127479/">https://habr.com/ru/post/127479/</a></p>
