    <h4>  Theory </h4><br>  Implement the transfer of money using transactions can be similar to how it is implemented in Bitcoin.  But to realize the issue will have a different way.  I will try to explain how you can try to implement this with an example. <br><br><a name="Kriya"></a><h5>  Kriya </h5><br>  For a start, I propose to introduce the concept of " <b>Kriya</b> " project.  The value of Kriya is determined depending on the number of "actions" spent on the implementation of the project and on the evaluation of the project by the society (the "karma" of the project).  In other words, Kriya is understood as the quantitative value of the value that the project brings to society. <br><br>  " <a href="http://www.waylove.ru/lib/energy/24/2.html">Kriya</a> - letters," action ". In the most general sense, means any activity, in a specific way - religious activity (rites, sacraments, etc.). In yoga and tantra (see) means controlled movements and postures of the body. <br><br><blockquote>  <a href="http://nathas.org/dictionary/krijja/">Kriya</a> (Kriya) - action, movement, activity.  The first two stages of ashtanga yoga (yama and niyama) make up separate kriya yoga, action yoga. <br>  In a general sense, kriya means any activity.  In a specific sense, it is a religious activity, especially rites, ordinances and ceremonies. <br></blockquote><br><a name="Artha"></a><h5>  Artha </h5><br>  In addition, I propose to introduce the concept of " <b>Artha</b> ".  By Artha we mean the accumulation of the user, his money. <br><br><blockquote>  <a href="http://nathas.org/dictionary/artxa/">Artha</a> - material prosperity, one of the goals of human life. <br></blockquote><br><h5>  Formulas </h5><br><a name="Formula1"></a>  The formula for changing the user‚Äôs Artha after voting is completed: <br>  <b><code> += </code></b> (1) <br><br><a name="Formula2"></a>  The issue of new money is determined as follows: <br>  <b><code> =  * </code></b> (2) <br><br>  New surplus value money is issued once for each project. <br>  If KriyaProject is less than zero, then there is no positive surplus value and no emission is made. <br><br><a name="Formula3"></a>  The formula for calculating the emission factor for the previous billing period (for example, for the previous 65536 cycles): <br>  <b><code> =  / </code></b> (3) <br>  Where <br> <code> =  / </code> <br> <code> =  / 65536</code> <br> <br>  The emission factor will allow smoothing periods of strong emission growth (with an influx of a large number of projects) and periods of a small number of projects.  When using this coefficient, the issue of money will be approximately the same size as in the first period of the system‚Äôs existence and in the subsequent ones.  During periods when there will be few projects per unit, Kriya will issue more money than during periods when there are many projects.  This should ensure the stability of the development of the system as a whole. <br><br>  In the initial period of the system, the formula for calculating the coefficient will not work.  Therefore, up to the moment of 65536 cycles, the CoefEmission must be taken of a constant value (constant).  For example, equal to 1.00.  Or, alternatively, starting the counting of the cycles not from the value 1, but from the value 65536. <br><br><a name="Formula4"></a>  The formula for determining the value of Kriya project, I propose this: <br>  <b><code> =  * </code></b> (4) <br><br><a name="Formula5"></a>  The formula for determining the value of the evaluation project: <br>  <b><code> = (*) / </code></b> (5) <br>  Where <br>  Rating - Evaluation of the Voting User <br>  Kriya - Voting User Kriya <br><br>  Project Evaluation will be able to take values ‚Äã‚Äãfrom -1 to +1.  A value of -1 is possible if all users vote against the project;  +1 value is possible if all users vote for the project.  Only users with a positive Kriya can evaluate a project; only Kriya positive is taken into account in the SumAccount value of AllUsers. <br><br><a name="Formula6"></a>  Formula user rating ("Karma" user): <br>  <b><code> = ()</code></b> (6) <br><br><a name="Formula7"></a>  Formula for determining user Kriya value: <br>  <b><code> = ()</code></b> (7) <br><br><h4>  Examples </h4><br><h5>  Simple example </h5><br>  Suppose there are three users with positive Kriya (User1, User2, User3).  User1, User2, User3 have the following Kriya values: <br> <code>User1 +1000</code> <br> <code>User2 +2000</code> <br> <code>User3 +3000</code> <br>  There are also three projects (Proj1, Proj2, Proj3) that created two other users (User4, User5).  User4 created projects Proj1 and Proj2, User5 created project Proj3.  Projects Proj1, Proj2, Proj3 collected the following amount of money for the implementation (cost of projects): <br> <code>Proj1 100</code> <br> <code>Proj2 200</code> <br> <code>Proj3 300</code> <br>  Suppose all three projects scored the required amount and were completed (but with different results).  Users voted for the projects as follows (who is for which project votes - rating): <br> <code>User1 Proj1 +1</code> <br> <code>User1 Proj2 +1</code> <br> <code>User2 Proj1 +1</code> <br> <code>User2 Proj2 -1</code> <br> <code>User3 Proj2 -1</code> <br> <code>User3 Proj3 -1</code> <br> <br>  The amount of Kriya users is: <br> <code>SummKriya = +1000+2000+3000 = 6000</code> <br> <br>  Only users with positive Kriya are counted, the rest are not involved in the calculation. <br><br>  Project estimates will be as follows ( <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/179715/">formula 5</a> ): <br> <code>ProjEst1 = (+1*1000+1*2000)/6000 = +0.50</code> <br> <code>ProjEst2 = (+1*1000-1*2000-1*3000)/6000 = -0.67</code> <br> <code>ProjEst3 = (-1*3000)/6000 = -0.50</code> <br> <br>  Kriya projects will be as follows ( <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/179715/">formula 4</a> ): <br> <code>ProjKriya1 = +0.50*100 = +50 =&gt; </code> <br> <code>ProjKriya2 = -0.67*200 = -134 &lt; 0 =&gt;  </code> <br> <code>ProjKriya3 = -0.50*300 = -150 &lt; 0 =&gt;  </code> <br> <br>  Changes Kriya authors of the projects will be as follows: <br> <code>UserKriya4 = ProjKriya1+ProjKriya2 = +50-134 = -84</code> <br> <code>UserKriya5 = ProjKriya3 = -150</code> <br> <br>  To calculate the emission coefficient, you need to know how much new money was created during the billing period (previous 65,536 cycles) and how much money was created during the entire life of the system (for example, 100,000 cycles have passed).  Suppose for the previous period 10,000 units of money were created, and for the entire period 12,000 units of money were created.  Then the coefficient for the emission will be as follows ( <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/179715/">formula 3</a> ): <br> <code>EmissionFactor = (12000 / 100000) / (10000 / 65536) = 0.786</code> <br> <br>  Issue will be ( <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/179715/">formula 2</a> ): <br> <code>Emission = 0.786*50 = 39  </code> <br> <br>  As a result, this new money will be credited to Proj1‚Äôs author‚Äôs Artha project ( <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/179715/">Formula 1</a> ): <br> <code>Artha += 39</code> <br> <br><h5>  An example of determining the maximum emission </h5><br>  0. Assume that at the time of the creation of the system 1000 units of money for the first project and 1000 units of Kriya will be issued. <br><br>  1. Further, when creating a second project with a cost of 1000 units and a positive assessment of the Kriya project, it will be: <br>  KriyaProject = + 1.0 * 1000 = 1000 <br>  Suppose CoefEmissions in the initial period of the system is equal to: <br>  Equity Ratio = 1.00 <br>  The emission will be: <br>  Emission = Emission ratio * KriyaProject = 1.00 * 1000 = 1000 <br>  The total amount of money in the system will be: <br>  TotalMassMoney = 1000 + 1000 = 2000 <br><br>  2. Further, when creating another 10 projects worth 200 units and with a positive assessment <br>  Total Kriya of all projects of the past period: <br>  Kriya of the Past Period = 1000 + 1000 = 2000 <br>  Total Kriya of all new projects: <br>  KriyaOdnogoNoproekta = + 1.0 * 200 = 200 <br>  KriyaNovProektov = 10 * 200 = 2000 <br>  Total issue: <br>  Emission = 10 * Energy ratio * KriyaProject = 10 * 1.00 * 200 = 2000 <br>  Total amount of money in the system: <br>  TotalMassMoney = 2000 + 2000 = 4000 <br><br>  3. Further, when creating another 10 projects worth 400 units and with a positive assessment of each <br>  Kriya of the Past Period = 2000 + 2000 = 4000 <br>  Total Kriya of all new projects: <br>  -Kriya OneNew Project = + 1.0 * 400 = 400 <br>  KriyaNovProektov = 10 * 400 = 4000 <br>  Total issue: <br>  Emission = 10 * Energy ratio * KriyaProject = 10 * 1.00 * 400 = 4000 <br>  Total amount of money in the system: <br>  Total Mass Money = 4000 + 4000 = 8000 <br><br>  And so on, increasing twice in each <u>project implementation cycle</u> . <br><br>  4. Consider a more realistic situation where the number of projects will increase and not all projects will receive positive ratings.  For example, another 10 projects will be created, each worth 800 units, but each project will score an average of 0.5 (which is equivalent to a situation where half the masses vote positively and the rest ignore the project). <br>  Total Mass MoneyPast = 8000 <br>  Past Kriya = 8000 <br>  Total Kriya of all new projects: <br>  KriyaOdnogoNoproekta = + 0.5 * 800 = 400 <br>  KriyaNovProektov = 10 * 400 = 4000 <br>  Total issue: <br>  Emission = 10 * Energy ratio * KriyaProject = 10 * 1.00 * 400 = 4000 <br>  Total amount of money in the system: <br>  TotalMassMoney = 8000 + 4000 = 12000 <br><br>  That is, the growth of the mass of money decreased and amounted to 4000/8000 = 0.5 = 50% for <u>the project implementation cycle</u> . <br><br>  The project implementation cycle is all the time when the money invested cannot be spent on anything until there is no solution, the project has collected the necessary amount of money or not.  The implementation of such transactions, in principle, will not be a difficult problem.  After it becomes known that a project has scored the required amount or not, the transaction is either confirmed or deemed not accepted.  If the fundraising of each project takes place over 10,000 cycles, then the maximum number of ‚Äúproject implementation cycles‚Äù will be 65536/10000 = 6. And during this time the maximum increase in the money supply will be 1000 * (2 ^ 6) = 64000. <br><br>  If there are no projects at all in this cycle or all projects receive negative votes, then there will be no emission. <br><br><h5>  Example 2 </h5><br>  Let us consider a more realistic example, when in the initial period not all projects will be assessed positively and free funds will not be invested in all projects. <br><br>  0. Assume that at the time of the creation of the system 1000 units of money for the first project and 1000 units of Kriya will be issued. <br><br>  1. Further, when creating a second project with a cost of 1000 units and a positive assessment of the Kriya project, it will be: <br>  KriyaProject = + 0.8 * 1000 = 800 <br>  Suppose CoefEmissions in the initial period of the system is equal to: <br>  Equity Ratio = 1.00 <br>  The emission will be: <br>  Emission = Emission ratio * KriyaProject = 1.00 * 800 = 800 <br>  The total amount of money in the system will be: <br>  TotalMassMoney = 1000 + 800 = 1800 <br><br>  2. Further, when creating another 2 projects worth 500 units each (for a total of 1000 units) and with an average estimate of +0.25 <br>  Total Kriya of all projects of the past period: <br>  Kriya of the Past Period = 1000 + 800 = 1800 <br>  Total Kriya of all new projects: <br>  KriyaOdnogoNoproekta = + 0.25 * 500 = 125 <br>  KriyaNovProektov = 2 * 125 = 250 <br>  Total issue: <br>  Emission = 2 * Effluent KriyaProject = 2 * 1.00 * 125 = 250 <br>  Total amount of money in the system: <br>  TotalMassMoney = 1800 + 250 = 2050 <br><br>  3. Further, when creating 3 more projects worth 300 units each and with an average grade of each +0.3 <br>  Kriya of the Past Period = 2000 + 2000 = 4000 <br>  Total Kriya of all new projects: <br>  KriyaOdnogoNoproekta = + 0.3 * 300 = 90 <br>  KriyaNovProektov = 3 * 90 = 270 <br>  Total issue: <br>  Emission = 3 * Effluent KriyaProject = 3 * 1.00 * 90 = 270 <br>  Total amount of money in the system: <br>  TotalMassMoney = 2050 + 270 = 2320 <br><br>  And so on, increasing not much per <u>project implementation cycle</u> . <br>  As a result, for the first 65536 cycles, according to estimates, it will turn out 10,000-20000 new units of money with an initial amount of 1,000 units. <br><br><h4>  What does all this give? </h4><br>  We are moving away from the shortcomings of the existing system.  Namely, in the proposed system will be: <br>  1. Security of money.  The money will be provided with really useful work. <br>  2. Distributed Emission.  Emission is clearly determined by the algorithm, and not a handful of bankers. <br>  3. Transparency.  The maximum possible transparent distribution of new money received during the emission. <br>  4. Security.  No one will ever be able to block money in your account. <br>  5. Anonymity.  If desired, you can use I2P to transfer system data. <br><br>  In the next part, I plan to provide for all possible system problems.  And, in particular, the problem of adequate evaluation of projects by the community.  To do this, I propose the division of the whole society into separate thematic communities and lay a more complex formula for calculating ratings.  In particular, project evaluation will depend on the project evaluation by project participants (those who have invested in the project) and by members of the thematic community (who will act as experts). <br><br>  Continued: <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/179867/">KriyaMoney.</a>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/179867/">Part 4. Possible problems and their solution</a> <br><br>  Ps1.  Sometimes it happens that a <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/175385/">domain name for an interesting idea is quickly occupied by cybersquatters</a> (in the comments on the link, pay attention to the date of publication of the comment and the date of registration of the domain).  Therefore, in order to prevent this from happening, I decided to take up the kriyamoney domain name in the com org and ru zones in advance.  If you have a desire to develop a project, write a client program (like bitcoin-qt) and also make a website, then I will be happy to give you all three domains. <br><br>  PS2.  The previous two articles have reduced my karma by half.  If the Habr community decides to fix my Karma completely, then I will not be able to lay out the following parts.
