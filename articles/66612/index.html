  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Wii Sports Resort - my first impressions</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> The main part of the article will be devoted to my impressions of the game Wii Sports Resort, but first I will tell you what the prefix might be interesting for computer scientists - the main contingent of Habr. <br>  For a very long time, I thought that game consoles are the lot of kids, adults, if they have not played enough in childhood, play only on computers.  But, this year my opinion changed dramatically when I purchased the Nintendo Wii console.  My impressions and reviews of games can be read in the <a href="http://blog.alexanderklimov.ru/">blog</a> , and I will say a few words about it for those who still think that consoles are intended for children.  First, the games will allow you to pull the fifth point off the computer chair or sofa and get a decent load on the body.  My friend, jumping in front of the TV for 10 minutes in the Boxing game, the next day, complained of pain in his muscles.  And having bought an additional accessory Wiifit, you can do yoga and strength exercises.  This is the first reason you might be interested in the console.  But if you cannot live without a computer and programming, then the craftsmen have managed to write special libraries to work with the Wii Remote, and you can create your own applications using the remote.  For example, there is a program that, when standing on the Wii Balance board, you can use the Wii Remote to travel in Google <b>Earth‚Äôs</b> program.  On Habr√© you can find references to these opportunities.  In a short time I also plan to get acquainted with these libraries. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  But today I will tell you about my impressions of the new game <b>Wii Sports Resort</b> .  Perhaps many of you already have this console, and you want to hear another opinion about this game.  And for someone, suddenly this article will become a starting point and will spur interest in the Wii prefix.

      Finally, we waited!  New game <b>Wii Sports Resort</b> has already appeared in Russia.  I already described <a href="http://blog.alexanderklimov.ru/post/Wii-Sports-Resort-Pervye-vpechatleniya.aspx">my first impressions</a> of this game when it was presented on Red Square.  But, I wanted to deal with it in more detail in a calm home environment.  The company <a href="http://www.nd.ru/">New CD</a> , which represents the interests of Nintendo in Russia, launched an advertising campaign about the start of sales of this game in Russia.  In the Union store on August 5 there was a special presentation with prizes to the first customers.  I drove after work to the store and bought a game.  Employees of the new disc gave me a large bath towel with the words Wii.  For which many thanks to them, I just needed to buy a towel for the shower. <br><br>  The company <b>New disc was</b> well prepared for this event by launching a <a href="http://www.nintendo.ru/wsr">special page</a> dedicated to the game Wii Sports Resort.  Flash animation of the island is made on the site almost one to one, as in the game.  Also on the site is very detailed about all the games: a lot of videos, instructions and other useful information.  I recommend to visit the site to explore the game. <br><br>  I will not repeat, but I will tell only about my impressions about the game.  I must say that when connecting, I did not use any instructions and manuals.  I was wondering if the user can figure out the game for himself.  And, admittedly, the developers have tried their best.  After I inserted the disk into the drive, the system update began.  The operation lasted a few minutes and I even began to show anxiety.  But, fortunately, the update was completed quickly and you could run the game.  The game begins with the launch of the training video, where the installation process of the new <b>Wii MotionPlus</b> accessory is shown in detail.  And then the game itself begins ... <br>  And the game also begins with the launch of the video - at an altitude of several thousand kilometers from the ground the plane flies.  In the compartment of the aircraft are two people - an instructor and a parachutist.  The instructor tears open the door and begins to push it, that the plane flies over the island and it's time to jump.  The parachutist, who was sitting with his back to me, turns around and I see myself ... I almost fell off my chair!  Of course, I saw not myself, but my character Mii, who had long been drawing in the character editor for a long time.  I was so used to my created unique character that I was taken aback when I saw him in a new game that I had never played before.  So, my character, that is, I, courageously approached the open door and siganul down.  And here was my first acquaintance with the capabilities of the Wii MotionPlus.  While Mii was floating in the air, I began to turn my Wiimote in my hands.  The parachutist, obeying my movements, very realistically tumbled in the air, just like real parachutes in films.  Then other parachutists came from somewhere.  And everyone began to grapple with each other, forming different shapes.  I decided to gossip a bit and started spinning, touching them with my body parts and disturbing them.  Then there was a clap, a parachute fired and everyone landed safely on the island.  And the game began Lost (LOST).  Just kidding. <br><br>  And then began the acquaintance with the 12th games, which the Japanese corporation generously bestowed on us.  Since descriptions of games can be found on the Nintendo website, which I mentioned above, I‚Äôll tell you about some of them. <br><br>  As in many games from Nintendo, access to some games can be obtained after passing through the previous modes.  There were no problems with this - all the first levels are quite simple.  But let's start in order. <br><br>  <b>Fencing</b> - the first mode is interesting for boys, when on the tower you need to push the enemy into the water.  I liked the other two games more.  <b>High-speed felling</b> has a certain amount of intelligence - the judge throws two identical objects to you and your opponent, and you need not just to cut it, but to cut it in the right direction: from top to bottom, diagonally, horizontally.  And it must be done faster than the opponent.  At first, without understanding, I just chopped off my shoulders))).  I liked the objects for cutting: watermelons, cakes, pencils, a vase with flowers, etc.  The animation is very high quality and cool.  MotionPlus clearly captures the direction of your hits and does not count for the wrong blow.  The third <b>clash</b> mode is also more suitable for the younger generation, but an adult man can swing his sword against a horde of opponents in order to stretch his body after work in the office or lose weight. <br>  The next game I liked was <b>Frisbee</b> or plate throwing.  The plot is simple - you throw a little plate, and your faithful dog runs after it.  If you have thrown the plate neatly and correctly, then your four-legged friend will have time to catch the plate and bring it back to you.  I liked the animation of the dog with good shots.  When the dog catches a plate high in the air, then with joy he begins to dance on his hind legs, the audience applauds all around, and you begin to be proud of your skill.  Once I even managed to see how the dog after a particularly successful throw made flips on the joys.  I suspect that the asset of the dog and there are other interesting tricks. <br><br>  The third game that can be a hit in the company is <b>Basketball</b> .  The first mode is training.  It is necessary for 60 seconds to throw in the basket 25 balls.  In Red Square, I have never failed to hit the target.  At home I calmly scored 19-21 balls from the first attempts at home in a calm atmosphere.  But I was much more attracted by the 3x3 mode.  This is a real game with combinations, false swing and deft throws.  The game involves two teams of three people.  At your disposal are three players that you can control.  You can pass to any of them and entrust the throw.  In my team, the girl differed with particular dexterity, and she constantly got into the basket from an acute angle.  You can also dribble and defend.  You can play against a computer opponent, but I want to try to play with someone from my friends.  In a sports company, this game should be a success. <br><br>  <b>Table tennis</b> was already familiar to me from the previous public presentation of the game, and there is nothing special to add here - a good game that will appeal to many. <br>  Of particular interest is the game <b>Canoe</b> .  As in the case of Fencing, this is a good way to warm up in the winter in a badly heated apartment.  You need to imagine that you have a paddle in your hands, which you need to row very vigorously in order to pass a track that is constantly increasing in the allotted time.  Fun developers have added a duck to the game with a family of ducklings who either prevent you from swimming, getting in the way, or swimming next to you, mockingly overtaking you while you are frantically waving your oar in the sweat of your face. <br>  And finally, the last game that attracted me was a real flight simulator.  You hold the remote like a model airplane and fly around an island.  You can do various aerobatic maneuvers, fly under a bridge or through tunnels, soar up sharply to avoid being hit with a rock, and so on.  My brother is a long-time fan of aviation and has always played in flight simulators, starting with the ZX Spectrum.  Be sure to tell him about this game. <br><br>  The rest of the game I tried to catch a glimpse and can not tell about them something interesting.  After I bought the game and the first emotions have subsided, you can sum up some of the results.  In advertising brochures, marketers are hard on the word <i>revolutionary</i> with respect to the Wii MotionPlus.  But, as a user, I did not feel any new features.  Of course, without this accessory, the games would not have turned out so, but I am talking about my feelings.  That is, increased accuracy of movements is taken for granted and is not noticed in games.  If we talk about the collection as a whole - my favorites are still Wii Sport (tennis and bowling), Wiifit and Guitar Hero.  Maybe a little later I will return to the Wii Sports Resort and pay more attention to it.  But, if you are a fan of Nintendo products, like me, then you must have this game in your collection. <br>  The novelty is already available in Moscow, and residents of other cities can order it through online stores, for example, through <a href="http://www.ozon.ru/context/detail/id/4586898/%3Fpartner%3Dvisual">OZON</a> . <br><br>  Play on health! <br><br>  Note: Screenshots, videos and other material on the game are presented in large numbers on the <a href="http://www.nintendo.ru/wsr">Nintendo</a> website, so I did not use them here. <br><br>  Upd.  People ask for pictures.  They gave a very good link to YouTube.  I will add to the review at the request of workers. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D5qcDjwRynyU">www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qcDjwRynyU</a> <br><br><br><br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/66612/">https://habr.com/ru/post/66612/</a></p>
