It never occurred to me to write an article about this, since I have no relation to programming, and in general I work in another field.  However, I found this topic interesting enough to tell about it in more detail. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  For the average user, ‚Äúcheats‚Äù are a kind of mythical means for winning in a network game, and any cheat is ‚Äúaim and bx‚Äù, but not many people know what it is and what they can do. <br><br>  Almost all of you have heard the words that are sometimes heard in games: ‚Äúaimbot‚Äù, ‚Äútriggerbot‚Äù, ‚Äúoffney in,‚Äù ‚Äúhe has a NoRecoil, report, throw‚Äù.  At the same time, people do not always know what it is, how it works, and in general, cheats in the representation of some are a kind of mythical improver of the skill with which you break everything around and do not fire.  Something that you can "download and go bend."  This is not entirely true, and I will try to tell about this in this article.

      So, in this publication we will consider: <br><br>  - Classification of cheats and methods of distribution (public, paid cheat from a cheat provider, private, customized); <br>  - The functionality of cheats: what is aimbot, triggerbot, esp, spinhack, ragehack, as well as the settings; <br>  - How to use cheats, using the example of CS: GO (some phenomena of the cheat scene); <br>  - How to play against cheater, using the example of CS: GO; <br>  - As well as some popular misconceptions. <br><br>  Perhaps, after reading this article, you will know exactly what to blame for watching you through the wall, but who cannot shoot;  or making wild vanchots of players who have an account for 15 hours. <br><br><blockquote>  <u>Disclaimer 1:</u> In order not to spread this infection, I will try to avoid the names of specific cheats.  The topic is full of nuances that I will try to touch on, but in many places I had to come to simplifications, because different providers have different functions under different names, with different settings and different implementations.  Therefore, in the form of simplifications do not forget that they are made with the aim of lowering unnecessary parts. <br><br>  <u>Disclaimer 2:</u> I am not a cheater, I am not connected with cheats and do not play with them.  I fully support the punishments of cheaters, including those used by Valve (bans of main accounts, with skins for 3-5 + thousand euros), and I dream that cheating in games would be impossible. <br><br>  <u>Disclaimer 3:</u> The publication will not be different behind-the-scenes drama, which there is not enough - rat, plums / purchase / theft of sources, copy-pasted cheats that are publicized under different names, pouring dirt on each other on the forums, plum chitoo in Valve / PB / more somewhere, or when the cheat is done solely to make money and then disappear from the scene after the first wave of bans.  This is undoubtedly interesting to a certain circle of people, but the purpose of the publication is different, namely, to tell what the mythical ‚Äúaim and vx‚Äù is. </blockquote><br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/56a/0cb/a5e/56a0cba5e40e4902b3938460e0212c61.png"></div><br><h1>  Cheat classification </h1><br>  For the end user, there are 4 classes: <br><br><ul><li><h4>  Public / public. </h4><br>  <b>Price:</b> ‚Ç¨ 0 <br><br>  <b>What:</b> This cheat can be anything from a implemented proof-of-concept, which is detected, to an attempt to write a full-fledged cheat, at the same time training your skills.  A cheat does not claim to be rich in functionality or ongoing support, but it may not be detected for some time.  Fast enough becomes [Detected].  They don‚Äôt take money for them, but you also get the appropriate functionality (sometimes - not bad for a free cheat, but it doesn‚Äôt reach the paid ones).  Do not count on permanent support or absence of detectors.  These cheats are practically not used, except for the sake of draining accounts, or if you bought a pack of hacked ack, and pay for a subscription is a pity for money.  They get banned quickly, often have poor settings and are intended only for ‚Äúfull hemming‚Äù, which is still not as strong as that of paid cheats. <br><br>  Sometimes they are downloaded by schoolchildren, or people who do not even know about the presence of paid cheats.  And pretty quickly ban.  This is basically a cheat for ‚Äúshake 10 minutes‚Äù, after which you ban or get Untrusted in CS: GO. <br><br>  <b>How to deliver to the client's computer:</b> Such a cheat is in the public domain and is distributed through the cheat forums.  They can be downloaded directly from there, sometimes even without registration.  They almost always do not have a client or a safe delivery method for the user (ie, what you downloaded is injected. Sometimes there is a dll file next to it that needs to be injected.). </li></ul><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">An example of how a public cheat is distributed</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e27/70f/ffe/e2770fffe8574027bb1f45df7216d4f8.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b35/836/b27/b35836b27f544fc0ab8714bc7be744c2.png"><br></div></div><br><ul><li><h4>  A paid cheat from a cheat provider / pay2cheat, paycheat, p2c, payhack, subscription hack / cheat, and various variations of slang.  Most often they are called private, which is not quite true. </h4><br>  <b>Price:</b> ‚Ç¨ 2.99- ‚Ç¨ 70 + per month, with discounts on purchases at 3/6/9/12 months. <br><br>  <b>What:</b> This cheat is distributed by the so-called "provider" and is commercial.  The developer (s) are interested in the fact that the cheat is not detected, and most often they succeed.  However, it is never known when it is detected, so buyers play at your own risk.  Some cheats were not detected for several years, but then Valve sharply bent down the cheat, and a whole bunch of accounts.  And often, even the basics, with content on many thousands of euros. <br><br>  It can cost from a couple of euros (if low-quality cheat) to 25-30 euros per month.  The latter often has a very rich functionality, has a lot of settings and configs, and depending on reputation and positioning can be very strong.  As in the case of games Hack vs Hack (about what it is, later), and for the "tackle-free" game and antelect. <br><br>  If a cheat is more expensive than 25 euros, it does not mean that it is somehow ‚Äúcool‚Äù, it can simply be positioned for other purposes - such as EAC, FACEIT, ESL, ESEA bypass.  Most often it is made for legit games at matches, streams and various ladders. <br><br>  <b>How to deliver to the client's computer:</b> Have protection from the "drain".  You download a client in a password-protected archive with a random name, following the precautionary rules specified by the provider.  It does not have a cheat in itself and is a ‚Äúclient‚Äù for downloading the latest version of a cheat from an provider's server (which is unique with each download. But sometimes it does not. <br><br>  When you first start the client is tied to the customer's hardware and sometimes puts the driver (but now the golden rule - the client should not leave behind any traces).  The subsequent injection can occur in different ways and sometimes can be a rather interesting implementation of protection against the detection. </li></ul><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">An example of what a paid cheat looks like.</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><br>  Pictures are clickable. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ba4/53f/0bf/ba453f0bf6504df5a0e8457bae98164c.png"></a> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f8b/a4c/ead/f8ba4cead28148c3937a0efdbf703581.png"></a> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e2b/fbf/f4c/e2bfbff4c0a340d8ba8d13360add3b76.png"></a> <br></div></div><br><ul><li><h4>  Private cheat with limited slots / private hack.  Often confused with "paid cheat", meaning private, and vice versa. </h4><br>  <b>Price:</b> ‚Ç¨ 20- ‚Ç¨ 500 + <br><br>  <b>What:</b> Cheat, which is available only to a limited circle of people, in order to avoid detection, or to delay it as much as possible.  Sometimes such a cheat can sell a private provider, limiting the number of purchases to 10 or 100-200, so that he has the smallest possible audience, and he did not attract attention.  These are not known to me.  These are mostly privately written cheats that are sold on forums or various marketplaces.  Most often they have under 10-50 "free" slots, linked to hardware, and may have very different functionality. <br><br>  Such cheats are made mainly for circumventing third-party anti-cheats, or a constant game based on for many years.  Depending on the skill of the author, they may never be denoted in general.  And they can banish after a couple of months. <br><br>  <b>How to deliver to the client's computer:</b> Have protection from the "drain".  The delivery method depends on the creativity of the author and may be similar to the delivery of paid cheat. </li></ul><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">An example of selling a private cheat</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/213/2f5/d5b/2132f5d5bfee4747834bfe5052f08e22.png"></div></div><br><ul><li><h4>  Customized cheat.  The rarest option for the richest, but it also exists. </h4><br>  <b>Price:</b> ‚Ç¨ Four-digit amounts. <br><br>  <b>What:</b> A person hires the services of a programmer.  Practically not practiced, but there is.  Sometimes you can find topics like "[WTB] private hack / cheat coder for 1 user, budget $ 2000".  There is a risk to get a sample cheat "on the back", so people with a budget buy privatka. <br><br>  <b>How is delivered to the client's computer:</b> The delivery method depends on the creativity of the author and such information is not publicly available. </li></ul><br><h1>  Functional paid cheats </h1><br>  The functionality, name and grouping of settings varies from provider to provider.  Some rivet sample cheats for an extensive number of games, some specialize in games from Valve, sometimes making cheats for other games on the principle of "if not laziness", and then we look at the set of functions for the average paid cheat.  It mainly consists of an interface for settings, and: <br><br><ol><li>  Aimbot </li><li>  Triggerbot </li><li>  Visuals (visuals, ESP, wallhack) </li><li>  Add.  Functions that do not fall into any of the categories, for example: spreader, knife trigger, speedhack, fakelag, spamming, chat spam, hanging in the air, spinbot / spinhack. </li></ol><br>  The implementation and name may differ from provider to provider, but the principle of operation remains the same. <br><br><h4>  Aimbot / aimbot </h4><br>  In the case of paid cheats, Aimbot is just a part of a complex cheat, and paid cheats with monthly pay are complex and quite complex cheats.  In public, they are simply called BX or an aimbot, without thinking about what exactly these words mean.  In fact, these cheats are ‚Äúmulti-hacks‚Äù, simply ‚Äúhacks‚Äù, or P2C (pay2cheat, paycheat, and various slang variations).  Most often they are called ‚Äúcheats‚Äù, although outside of Russian-speaking countries, these are exactly ‚Äúhacks‚Äù (‚Äúhacks‚Äù). <br><br>  Aimbot is only a part of a complex cheat, and it can have one or several modes / tabs for settings: Aimbot, Ragebot, FullRage, Legitbot, MM, LegitAim (they are called differently, but the purpose of the mode is passed). <br><br>  A typical ‚Äúaimbot in vacuum‚Äù looks like this: you pinch a button, the scope jumps to a given part of the opponent‚Äôs body and leads it exactly in the center until the button is released.  May include, for example, such triggers as: "when firing", "by pressing the button", "first 3 bullets".  Contrary to popular misconception, the aimbot doesn‚Äôt shoot itself unless AutoFire is turned on.  As a rule, the audience is scorched by the fact that the sight sharply ‚Äújumps‚Äù at the target in a straight line, and the jerks do not coincide with the general style of the cheater.  Initially, the aimbot was simply fixed on some part of the opponent‚Äôs body (head, for example) and from the side it is very obvious.  Over time, aimbot evolved, acquired a more modeless mode and a bunch of settings. <br><br><ul><li>  How does it look from the side?  The cheater sees you, his sight jumps sharply on a given part of the body along a straight path, and shoots (with or without a rifling sight).  Identify quite easily if the aimbot is not ‚Äúhidden‚Äù by other settings. </li></ul><br>  <u>Different groups with settings are:</u> <br><br>  <b>One of them</b> may be called <i>Ragebot</i> - this is aimbot, where the settings are made for ‚Äúgo to full rage‚Äù (rage, ‚Äúgo full rage‚Äù).  In it, you can unscrew the settings to the maximum and "break everything around."  Such tabs as AntiAim (spinhack) can be placed in this tab.  In this case, the player can spin and sweep all possible places on the map.  Depending on the author of the cheat, it can be quite a powerful thing, especially with ‚ÄúWallscan‚Äù (Autowall, proskanom points lumbago).  Then you run around the map, spinning around, and breaking everything around, even if the enemy sticks out the heel in the place where it is shot, but it depends on the skill of the writer of the cheat. <br><br>  A powerful full-cheat cheat can be called a ragehack (rage hack).  This is a cheat originally planned to break as much as possible at maximum settings.  However, such a cheat always has a legit mode.  Before CS: GO improved the defense, such a cheat was just hell for the enemy team: the cheater hung in a jump, and, spinning, broke the enemy team even through walls and corners. <br><br>  <b>The other group of settings</b> , if it exists at all, is intended for a ‚Äúmatchless‚Äù game in matchmaking, or on a stream.  Most often, these settings are called <i>"Legitbot"</i> with a hint that it is aimbot.  This is not entirely true, and is used rather to separate settings.  There is an aimbot in this category, but it is used only for certain types of weapons, such as, for example, AWP.  It has a more ‚Äúlegit‚Äù lying with less obvious aiming, or ‚Äúlets go‚Äù the target after the nth shot. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Sample Settings Window</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><br>  Please note that Legitbot is a group of settings for the ‚Äúlegit‚Äù style of play, and in the ‚ÄúRagebot‚Äù tab are settings for a full burnout, although there is an aimbot in both tabs. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/25a/0ba/365/25a0ba365af543d6905cddf91a9d6185.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ec3/e64/bec/ec3e64bec4fe475b85a59b7e8be02168.png"></div></div><br>  Cheaters who do not want to burn, in a crude simplification, use two combinations: <br><br><ol><li>  Aimbot with a narrow angle of capture + SilentAim, so that the jerks of the sight were not visible to the spectators and the patrol.  In CS: GO it is used for sniper rifles in order to get a shotgun "on the skill".  On closer viewing, you can see how the person shoots by, and the AWP bullet flies to the other side, and exactly to the body / head.  It is rarely used, because it is very noticeable, and you need to monitor the shooting all the time so as not to burn. <br><br></li><li>  Triggerbot with a higher percentage of hits.  If you increase the percentage of hits, it sometimes makes sense to turn on SilentAim so that there is no shaking of the sight (depends on the implementation).  But then the situation is repeated, as with the AWP - the cheater turns the line in the hand, and the bullets go to the head, dropping to the neck or torso.  <u>It is used almost always</u> , because it is the most bespalevny way to "send bullets where necessary", while not rubbing the camera.  And here we go to the triggerbooter: </li></ol><br><h4>  Triggerbot / triggerbot </h4><br>  Initially it was a function that makes a shot when the enemy hits the crosshair.  And that's all.  Example of use - on de_dust2 aim at the AWP at the gate, hold down the button that turns it on, and wait for the enemy to run through the sight.  The rifle shoots itself.  Triggerbot was used to "take the reaction." <br><br>  In our time, the triggerger has evolved and now only the cheapest, lazily written cheats are being ‚Äúreacted‚Äù.  Modern triggerbugs have learned not only to execute a shot in a situation when you hit the enemy 100%, but also to ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù the spread during the shot, ‚Äúdirecting the bullets‚Äù where necessary - namely, to selected parts of the body.  In 99% of cases, it is configured to turn on the shooting button.  The main purpose of the trigger is the least pale, but consistently kill the enemy for 1-5 shots.  <u>It is with him that most cheaters play</u> , preferring a triggerbot instead of an aimbot. <br><br>  The scatter is ‚Äúcorrected‚Äù by one of or a combination of both methods: <br><br><ol><li>  The sight is led down, following the pattern of scatter weapons.  When you hold the shot button, the weapon goes down so that all the bullets hit one point.  Although not a trigger job, it is most often configured through it. </li><li>  Corrects the spread so as to increase the percentage of hits on the enemy, or in other words, ‚Äúsend bullets‚Äù where necessary. </li></ol><br>  If, in the case of an aimboat, your aim was aimed for the bullets to fly to the right place, in the case of modern trigger guards, the bullets are already ‚Äúguided‚Äù.  The main difference with the aimbot is that the deflection angle cannot be greater than the spread of the weapon itself.  If the lazily tuned Aimbot + SilentAim could send a bullet 20 ¬∞ from the sight, then with a triggerbot you simply miss if the target is outside the normal spread of hits. <br><br>  Properly configured triggerbearing is incredibly difficult to catch, with him often even play on the stream, turning off the visuals.  The sight does not jump and does not ‚Äúcatch‚Äù on a part of the body (as is the case with the aimbot). <br><br>  How does it look from the side? <br><br><ol><li>  For example, a cheater can shoot <u>on the run</u> , and most of the bullets still hit the head / neck / chest.  The scatter of weapons does not coincide with what should be, and more bullets than you should fall into you.  In CS: GO, this is very obvious when you increase the distance, when the first thought after you were killed - ‚Äúsomething burst into the head with a lot of bullets‚Äù. <br><br></li><li>  You stuck your head at a distance of half a card, and there was a line at its center.  It is the turn, or <u>very</u> fast single shots, which would still cause a return.  The fact is that the skill player can adjust the spread so that the bullets hit about one point ... but with an increase in the distance, the spread still cannot be adjusted so perfectly - this is what strikes the eye. <br><br></li><li>  At high settings: The cheater's sight is next to the head (so that it misses otherwise), it shoots, the first 1-3 bullets hit the head, the next miss, following the scatter of the weapon.  Thanks to him, in high ranks, people do not understand how they got into them.  And just - made a couple of shots next to your head. <br><br>  It can be obvious, but it's still difficult to notice them in straight arms. <br><br></li><li>  As a rule, the target of a trigger job is the least pale, but consistently, to kill the enemy for 1-5 shots. </li></ol><br>  <u>How to notice on the demo?</u> <br><br>  In inexperienced hands or in a ‚Äúnon-steaming‚Äù cheater, the triggerbot is easy to notice: the parsing of a weapon does not follow what it should be, and it does not make maneuvers to make it less noticeable. <br><br>  If the cheater makes attempts to hide, then earlier ( <i>and now?</i> ) When viewing the demo or Patrol recording, it was possible to turn on the visualization of scatter + recoil + hits.  Then they turned on the free camera and watched the place where the bullets hit.  To counter, the developers made sure that the bullets didn‚Äôt get exactly to the center, so this method is not always relevant, but it helped ( <i>and still helps?</i> ) The experienced Patrolman. <br><br>  It is difficult to notice them in direct hands - the cheater will actively mask the trigger: sit down when firing, do not make more than 3-4 shots at a time, specifically miss, or surrender if more than two enemies come from different sides.  However, sometimes the moments described above still skip over. <br><br>  <i>PS: May the experts forgive me for such simplifications.</i>  <i>Different providers group their settings in different ways, and sometimes a triggerbot can be a mixture of NoRecoil + NoSpread or reduce the spread by a given percentage, and sometimes it can be done only by an embot.</i>  <i>Other providers may not trigger a trigger in the classic sense of the word, but engage in ‚Äúdirecting bullets‚Äù to a part of the body selected in the settings, introducing a predetermined percentage of misses.</i>  <i>The topic is full of nuances, I tried to touch it, without making a review of several dozen implementation options.</i> <br><br><h4>  Visuals / esp / visuals;  what is often called "ix" or "wallhack" (wallhack) </h4><br>  The same BX that allows you to see through the walls.  It can be completely miserable and just draw squares around enemies.  And it may have a lot of settings: painting the head in a bright color or highlighting player models, show lives, armor, hitbox, weapons. <br><br>  This may include features such as NoFlash, NoSmoke, NoSkybox, sight, mini-map (radar). <br><br><h4>  Other functions </h4><br>  <b>SilentAim:</b> It has two similar <b>things</b> . <br><br>  <u>The first:</u> Hides suspicious movements during the residence of the aimbot or triggerbot.  The camera from the first person does not jump, does not shake, or does not go down, following the weapon scatter pattern. <br><br>  <u>Second:</u> You can move the camera no matter where you shoot.  The essence of the function is that you can turn on the 360 ‚Äã‚Äãdegree review, go ahead yourself, and the aimbot will kill people from behind (while the camera is looking forward, that is, the camera does not depend on where the aimbot shoots).  This worsened the accuracy and speed of response, but it was popular on public servers so that you could ‚Äúrun and break everything around,‚Äù without stopping to shoot. <br><br>  Flawlessly firing a patrol (overwatch) - you shoot into nowhere (or up / at the floor), and the enemy dies.  Or the camera simply looks up or down, and turns (although from the patrol side, the spinbot looks exactly the same, but it depends on the forwardness of the encoder).  Another variation SilentAim'a combined with the trigger, as described above. <br><br>  <b>Spinhack / Spinbot / AntiAim:</b> The player‚Äôs model starts spinning around on its axis, walking backward twitching up and down, and what technologies have not been invented here.  Can at the same time look at the floor / up, or wave the gun.  The main purpose of the spinbot is the HvH game (hack vs hack), and there is to mislead the aimbot / trigger cheater in the enemy team.  HvH is when there are cheaters on both servers in the server, and one of them decides to "go and break" without hiding. <br><br>  Cheap or copied cheats were very well deceived - the aimbot shot a spinning model, sometimes in the head, but it didn‚Äôt hit and all the bullets flew past.  One of the providers managed to do quite a harsh Spinhak - you look at how your body is shot at you, but all the bullets fly through you and make slip sounds, and you have 100% hp.  Sometimes it has features like ‚ÄúFakeduck‚Äù, when the model also crouches very quickly, while maintaining the speed of the run. <br><br>  <u>On the patrol demo or for the viewer, it looks like this:</u> The hellish camera is spinning, looking up or down, sometimes still pulling the gun up and down.  During the shots, the spinning stops, but the skilled coders had time to insert a ‚Äútorsion‚Äù between the shots. <br><br>  <a href="https://youtu.be/jYJECVq6Cfs">What it looks like from the side</a> (in the video the spinbot is not very strong). <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Several gif-pictures for demonstration (the first gif, the second opens webm-video)</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3ae/e01/5aa/3aee015aae894329bc5d354b5b1e63da.gif"></div><br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c4d/bd7/12a/c4dbd712ae5a4781b69d0e20ea1cddff.gif"></div><br></div></div><br>  Another camera can be turned upside down: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b7d/099/14e/b7d09914ee1e45c18365a4f94455d925.png"></a> </div><br>  <i>(The picture is clickable.

Used to mislead the target of a cheater from an enemy team.  Against strong aimbot not effective. <br><br>  <b>AirStuck:</b> You hang in the air.  Used exclusively in HvH games, for positioning.  Allowed to hang in the air, and hide parts of the body in unplayable places where the enemy could not shoot you, and shoot him first. <br>  This resulted in whole matches in all 30 rounds, because two experienced cheaters with a full time break broke each other with a 50% chance, and the rounds were about who would sit out or who would endure someone. <br><br>  <b>Bunnyhop / Raspryg:</b> Allows you to do Raspryg, holding one button.

Remarkably, it was private, not a corrupt cheat.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Slots sold for hundreds of dollars. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It was fixed right after it began to spread, because someone leaked the method.</font></font><br><br><h1><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">What is used cheat CS: GO. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Before now</font></font></h1><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Previously, CS: GO was full of hell, when almost all cheats worked with full functionality, and Untrusted bans were rare. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Now the number of cheaters diminished, but, in my opinion, there are still very few of them there. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Here I will touch on some phenomena that are not completely known to the public. </font></font><br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Boosting / boosting / boost:</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Buying "wins" in order to obtain a high rank. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Prior to the introduction of the zeroing of ranks in CS: GO, they got up according to the following scheme - 4 students + 1 cheater, who pinched W, and went to break with the maximum settings. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Sometimes he deliberately turned around to annoy the enemy team, even if there was no cheater in it. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This is not a joke about schoolchildren - if you vote for a common voice chat, then they start screaming (!) In a prepubertal voice, about how they bend you, gg ez, you are noobie, mamma, hi, thanks for the win. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Accounts for such purposes were taken in the following ways:</font></font><br><br><ol><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Account to emit. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A game / account was bought for a penny, after which the booster had to ‚Äúlive it up‚Äù in as many matches as possible, the more the better. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Often they went right away with a full shuffle, so that the enemy team would kick their own, and vote Give Up.</font></font></li><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">According to the account for the match. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Also, a game / account was bought for a penny, after which the cheater played one game per account per day, with a full time record. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In this case, the accounts were enough for a month, if you're lucky.</font></font></li></ol><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Hell itself began when two teams of boosters met, then the cheater tried to break the enemy while slowly increasing the settings. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The team helped him in this, for example, by closing his cheater so that he would have time to kill the enemy while he was killing them. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Patience broke and sometimes both cheaters cut it to the full, and went to spin against each other. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If one of them had a worse cheat, the losing team immediately began to feel sad and ceased to offer resistance, while the victorious ones mocked the reader, who could not break them, and lured away the clients to themselves.</font></font><br><br><div class="spoiler"> <b class="spoiler_title">         </b> <div class="spoiler_text"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aEnOkfqQ10I" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br></div></div><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Anti-boost:</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Opposite entertainment when 3-5 friends went in search of other boosters. For this, a game was bought, or stolen accounts with open matchmaking, several games were won with a score of 15-0, and the chance to get on boosters increased dramatically. Seeing the nicknames containing the word ‚Äúboost‚Äù, in the opposite team, 1-5 people were cut to the ground and went to break. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">As a rule, anti-boosters bought the strongest cheat, despite the price (but it was not always the most expensive). In addition to their cheats, there were various tactics to delay the match in their arsenal. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Since the goal of the boosters was to win as many games in a row as possible against honest players, delaying time could cost them both an account ( </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">with a large number of reports, the patrol could ban them right during their game</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> ) and customers.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Stumbling on anti-boosters, boosters either gave up or tried to turn on the full rage. As a rule, anti-boosters won almost all the clashes, so boosters quickly gave up. Some, after several defeats and loss of customers, went to try different cheats. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The most ‚Äújuice‚Äù was to find the same Tipcs in the next search, and once again break them with a full podrub, spamming the chat with the phrases ‚ÄúFREE ANTI-BOOST SERVICE‚Äù. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If the boosters cheat was not weak, the game could drag on for up to 30 rounds, with sitting on the backache, hammer throwing, and hanging in the air in unchecked places. Anti-boosters, owning the necessary experience, still often won, while delaying the very necessary boosters, and increasing the chance of a ban.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Sometimes, if you provoke those who bought the boost strongly enough, they could get them off from their main accounts. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And even then they lost in 80% of cases, and at the same time they lost the main account. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Often they would begin to leave the game without leaving it, so that the game would end. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Then the class itself was to stretch the round in order to reach the next one, after which they would wait for the ban to leave the game and beat those who did not quit. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Now this kind of dubious "service" has almost disappeared, and will be boosted very carefully, not playing with one account more than once, and in general it has become unprofitable.</font></font><br><br>  Here's what it looks like: <br><br><div class="spoiler"> <b class="spoiler_title"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Video with comments when two cheaters try to win</font></font></b> <div class="spoiler_text"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HQiDEjD0Jx0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br></div></div><br><div class="spoiler"> <b class="spoiler_title"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">One of the old videos of anti-boosters. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Earlier in matchmaking it happened exactly</font></font></b> <div class="spoiler_text"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0SmzMRQs5ls" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br></div></div><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For this‚Ä¶. </font></font><br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Bought hacked accounts</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> at different sites, for a penny. They were used for a ‚Äúone-time‚Äù burned out or ‚Äúbefore the first ban‚Äù, and with them they either went up or broke up other boosters. Very sad people went to live alone, for several games in matchmaking, after which they got banned, and the account was thrown away or soon returned by the owner. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Now the shop was almost covered, starting to block all accounts on the account purchaser's computer, and the lovers of the props diminished sharply. </font></font><br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">What do we have now?</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> With the latest updates, many features have made it impossible. Impossible aimbot with 100% accuracy, it is impossible to run and spinning to break everything on the run. Attempts to even turn on these functions lead to a ban for 1-30 minutes.</font></font> And this is good. <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Valve has recently increasingly began to ban all accounts on the cheater's computer (from which he played during the period when he played with cheats on one of the lines). </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Banned if the general email and phone. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In general, I very much welcome these measures, and fully support the methods that will detect cheaters and ban all their accounts, including the main one. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">After the wave of bans, when the cheaters were banned from the basics with skins for many thousands of euros, the ‚Äúlive‚Äù on the MM servers became much less. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But, unfortunately, there are still too many of them.</font></font><br><br><h1><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> How to play against cheater on the example of CS: GO </font></font></h1><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Everyone knows that unpleasant feeling, when a cheater comes across an enemy team, and no matter how hard you try, you cannot win. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Forget about winning, because the cheater decides whether you win the match or not. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Start with a report. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">After this, your task in this game will be to dissolve the cheater for errors and ‚Äúfawn‚Äù, which the Patrol considers sufficient for a ban. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">So what can you do?</font></font><br><br><ol><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Use smoke grenades more often. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The most common mistake is when the cheater shoots in the smoke, supposedly "shooting through". </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The trick is that if he has a trigger, and he shoots the smoke in which you are standing, the bullets can get away from the sight and hit you. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Or, shooting at a team mate who has come out of the smoke, he can press it so that the scope will jump into the smoke after the death of the team mate.</font></font></li><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Try to go to the cheater, throwing his blind grenades. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This is the moment at which they can burn. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Or not to press at all, being afraid to get on the demo.</font></font></li><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Try to tease him around corners, for example, to make a movement as if you are going to go out, but not go out. </font></font></li><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Keep the standard places in which the cheater is sleeping, coming out on you. </font></font></li></ol><br><h1><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Popular misconceptions and questions </font></font></h1><br><blockquote><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> An aimbot is all that a cheater needs, and in general they all have an aimbot. </font></font></blockquote><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In fact, the aimbot is part of a complex cheat, and private cheats with monthly payments are complex and quite complex cheats. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In public, they are simply called BX or an aimbot. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In fact, these cheats are ‚Äúmulti-hacks‚Äù, simply ‚Äúhacks‚Äù, or P2C (pay2cheat, paycheat, and various slang variations). </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A cheater can use anything, and sometimes it's pretty hard to say what.</font></font><br><br><blockquote><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> For cheats do not banyat. </font></font></blockquote><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In fact, banyat cheats, though not immediately. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the case of VAC, for a public cheat ban can be obtained immediately. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For a fee - many months later, and, unfortunately, during this time, the cheater will have time to spoil more than one game. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">An exception may be private cheats with less than 50 users, but there is always a risk of being banned. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Many hoped that they would never be banned, and then they lost their main accounts with skins for many thousands of euros. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Never use cheats. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The developers themselves openly declare that they do not give any guarantees. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">You use cheats at your own peril and risk, and no one owes you anything.</font></font><br><br><blockquote><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> If I live on hacked accounts, then basically I will never be banned. </font></font></blockquote><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Tell it to those who have lost the inventory in the cost of many thousands of euros. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Can ban your primary account along with the one from which you live. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This can happen a week later, and maybe a few months later. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In addition to the ban by VAC, for the purchase of hacked accounts, they practice disabling all accounts on the computer, and they can not be returned. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Moreover, if you register a new account, and the owner of the stolen realizes only after some time, your new account can also be disabled.</font></font><br><br><blockquote><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Cheats can write any student. </font></font></blockquote><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In fact, high-quality paid cheats are a whole industry with millions of incomes. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Imagine if there are about 30,000 active ‚ÄúPremium‚Äù participants on a forum per month, each of whom has paid at least ‚Ç¨ 20- ‚Ç¨ 25. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This is more than ‚Ç¨ 750,000 euros, and yes - maybe someone bought Lifetime, someone paid ‚Ç¨ 50 for 3 months. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I brought this example to give you an idea about the amounts that are in this business. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Naturally, cheats for ESEA, ESL, EAC, are more expensive and have a smaller audience, but people earn not bad money on this, and it is in their interest that the cheat works. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The developers themselves do not believe that something is low, for them it is a business or a hobby.</font></font><br><br><blockquote><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> How are things with Blizzard, with the game Overwatch? </font></font></blockquote><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> The developers of commercial cheats said basically two things: </font></font><br><br><ol><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Protection is too complicated and not worth the effort, </font></font></li><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Blizzard is suing </font></font></li><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Or, as a third option, vaguely denied that ‚ÄúThe hack was discontinued‚Äù, and most likely the reasons were precisely in 1. or 2. paragraph. </font></font></li></ol><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Now there are only private snaps, but some developers have already received "letters of happiness" in the mail, with threats to receive a claim. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Unfortunately, I did not follow the scene for quite a long time, so I do not have deeper information about OW.</font></font><br><br><h1>  Afterword </h1><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Now that you have read the publication, it may be easier for you to identify cheaters in games, or to notice the impossible moments. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">As mentioned above, the purpose of the publication is to tell what the mythical ‚ÄúAim and Bx‚Äù is. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If after the publication there will be an opportunity to edit the list of delusions (and questions), I will fill them up as the discussion goes. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If you have any corrections, clarifications, criticism or questions, I will be glad to accept and hear them. </font></font><br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Play fair!</font></font></b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/401813/">https://habr.com/ru/post/401813/</a></p>
