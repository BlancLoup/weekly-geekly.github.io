  <section class="page js-page"><h1>There is work in RnD, or how to get away from monotonous and minor tasks</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Recently, we decided to allocate RnD-activity Nexign (formerly Peter-Service) into a separate division, distributed across three cities of Russia - Moscow, St. Petersburg and Novosibirsk.  Since then we have been actively looking for new professionals for him who will determine the shape of our main decisions in the future.  In this post we will describe in detail how RnD Nexign works and whom we are looking forward to in our team. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/301/6b7/ed4/3016b7ed4e6a737c08087eb1a5bf9988.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  RnD Nexign is divided in accordance with the company's three main products - BSS (Business Support System), NWM (Network Monetization) and IoT (Internet of Things).  The teams are not tied to any one city, the experts from all the cities of presence are working perfectly in the same city.  For talented employees living elsewhere, we can help with moving to any of these cities. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fbd/9ce/2b6/fbd9ce2b6ee2a0ccfa831dceac78da1d.jpg">

      Basically, all Nexign divisions interact with customers, and their work is aligned with requests from customers.  RnD is distinguished by the fact that it develops products, focusing on the product roadmap created in the company's product division on the basis of market analysis and customer needs in the target segment.  Based on the roadmap and product requirements, business analysts create requirements for product development. <br><br>  By analyzing queries, RnD determines the architecture, the organization of all our products.  The development of the products in RnD is organized into two-month super sprints, by the end of each of which new functionality appears at the system level at the system level.  According to their results, RnD shows a demo for the product team. <br><br><h2>  NWM - Network Monetization </h2><br>  NWM is a comprehensive solution with which you can provide billing and manage service delivery policies in real time.  NWM covers all known network standards and services - mobile and fixed communications, VAS and OTT services, e-commerce and payment cards.  NWM meets industry standards and can be integrated with existing telecommunications networks and billing systems.  In general, this is one of the key elements of the infrastructure of any BSS solution for communication providers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/dc2/16b/532/dc216b532eedcf6dafdb8591dbbdfa15.png"><br>  <i>Smart words: NWM is a 3GPP PCC architecture with a basic OCS (Online Charging System) node, additional functions (Policy and Charging Control Function) and supporting services, such as UDR (User Data Repository).</i> <br><br>  The largest user of our NWM system is a telecom operator with an audience of about 70 million active subscribers with a total number of transactions per second in the region of 30-50 thousand.  To develop such a high-load service, we use the programming language C ++.  We have developed our own set of system libraries for this programming language, in which all components of our system are developed.  These components can be combined and customized, depending on the wishes of customers. <br><br>  The NWM development team is divided into three groups.  Highly skilled programmers are engaged in the development of the system kernel.  Other C ++ developers develop off-the-shelf services with NWM.  And the third group is engaged in customization - they work with the scripting Lua programming language, which is quite actively used in telecom, for example, for customization of Cisco service platforms. <br><br>  A feature of our NWM system is that it inherits a large number of components from other products.  Now there are up to 2-3 subsystems per one NWM developer - services that provide a specific PCC function.  Such a volume does not create trouble due to the well-functioning work of testing specialists - we have about the same number of developers.  We try to eliminate to the maximum the stages of manual testing due to automation, but this does not save developers from the obligation to cover the code with unit tests. <br><br>  Now within the framework of the roadmap we are developing NWM towards NFV, we divide monolithic components into microservices, including the possibility of building a cloud solution. <br><br><h2>  BSS - Business Support System </h2><br>  BSS (Business Support System) is a complete solution for business process management, the software heart of the operator business.  Among the tasks of the BSS is to recognize, charge, calculate a client, provide services to him, issue an invoice, accept payment and make it so that everyone is pleased.  Even this list already looks impressive.  And now, with the development of the BSS carrier business, they are becoming more complex and taking on new tasks.  Once everything was limited to sending service SMS and forming admissible negative limits, and now, for example, advanced advise, prompts of new tariffs, individual offers of new services are already connected. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a36/aa6/351/a36aa6351f9d3589dbdc93b86c5de64c.png"><br><br>  There is a myth that BSS is an ossified system where nothing interesting is expected.  This is not true.  According to its structure, BSS is a large set of different services, where there is a place for a variety of modern standards and technologies: machine learning and claudification, omnichannel and microservice architecture, in the future - 5G and active AI implementation.  You can read more about the potential of BSS in one of our previous <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/billing/blog/344236/">posts</a> . <br><br>  Within the framework of all RnD, we are ready to create teams for those open-source solutions, in which we see a future for product development.  Any specialist, in principle, can find a place for himself in RnD BSS, if his work fits into two main vectors of BSS Nexign development - reducing the cost and increasing the stability of the service.  If we talk about purely technical specialists, we are very much looking forward to experts on NoSQL, Java, automated and load testing.  And we will be happy to business analysts and architects with experience in telecom, knowledge of standards and industry requirements. <br><br><h2>  IoT - Internet of Things </h2><br>  Our IoT platform allows you to integrate with various sensors, aggregate and sell information from them.  Based on this platform, our customers can build ready-made IoT solutions in various areas: logistics, smart city, industry and not only. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bd8/d81/d78/bd8d81d78e5f19f9f67b43b3b25ec007.png"><br><br>  In RnD IoT, as in the other two directions, the full production cycle is also introduced, starting with business intelligence and ending with assembly on information stands.  Most of the technology stack is the Java backend.  In addition to it, there are commands that create UI in a web application and do realtime integration with network devices via C ++ and Lua. <br><br><h2>  General wishes </h2><br>  Narrow technical queries we cited above.  Now - what we expect from all candidates in RnD.  High motivation is very important, the desire to express themselves and actively develop, the desire to see the product as a whole, and not just within the framework of its own piece of code.  We do not demand that our candidates immediately give answers to complex tasks - you must agree, the ability to come to a decision on their own is much more valuable, logically justifying all the steps along the way. <br><br>  For our part, we are ready to personally support each newcomer and provide him with an experienced mentor / curator - as a rule, team leader or technical team.  You can contact them for any questions related to the task.  At the request of newbies, the curators detail the tasks, explain the nuances, willingly share the best practitioners - in general, they do everything so that the new person becomes a full-fledged member of the team as soon as possible. <br><br>  We will be happy to answer questions in the comments. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/354516/">https://habr.com/ru/post/354516/</a></p>
