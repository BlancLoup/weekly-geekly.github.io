This, you guessed it, is good old Denwer.  He firmly settled on my computer back in 2003.  Other alternatives, if they existed at the time, were known in narrow circles and were not so popular. <br><br>  Let's look at what we can use today, after so many years.  I propose to consider, test and compare 14!  software systems designed for the development of sites for Windows. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  1. AMPPS </h4><br>  Latest version: 1.7 <br>  Russian language: there is (partially) <br>  Portable version: No <br>  Homepage: <a href="http://www.ampps.com/">http://www.ampps.com/</a>

All this economy is painstakingly cataloged and described in detail. <br><br>  The undoubted advantage of this assembly is the support of many common CMS, blog platforms, web forums, message boards, photo galleries and so on.  There are more than 200 applications available!  The set of components included in the package also keeps up with life, all modules are quite fresh and, which is remarkable, here we can find such exotics as Python and MongoDB. <br><br>  Of the minuses, I want to mention a partial Russian translation, which is present only in the script directory, and even then not everywhere.  After restarting Apache, the tray menu refused to work, restarting Windows did not help.  Another disadvantage is the lack of portability.  In my opinion, AMPPS is more useful for newbies to learn scripts than for serious developers.  I was not very comfortable working with this software package, there are better options. <br><br><br><h4>  2. AppServ </h4><br>  Latest version: 2.5.10 <br>  Russian language: No <br>  Portable version: No <br>  Homepage: <a href="http://www.appservnetwork.com/">http://www.appservnetwork.com/</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8de/de5/2a5/8dede52a5603098ab39f652c449325e6.png" alt="Appserv"><br><br>  Basic set: <br><br><ul><li>  Apache 2.2.8 </li><li>  PHP 5.2.6 </li><li>  MySQL 5.0.51b </li><li>  phpMyAdmin-2.10.3 </li></ul><br>  Apache and MySQL are installed as services.  There is no management program, only a page of dubious design with a link to PhpMyAdmin.  At its core, AppServ is a graphical installer for Apache, PHP, MySQL, and nothing more.  If the same Denwer itself starts the components, then here they are simply installed as services and managed by Windows itself. <br><br><br><h4>  3. Denwer </h4><br>  Latest version: 3.2010-11-07 <br>  Is there Russian language <br>  Portable version: Yes <br>  Homepage: <a href="http://www.denwer.ru/">http://www.denwer.ru/</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/166/696/756/166696756ccbfc3df6941628f0993da7.png" alt="denwer"><br><br>  Basic set: <br><br><ul><li>  Apache 2.2 </li><li>  PHP 5.3.3 </li><li>  MySQL 5.1.40 </li><li>  phpMyAdmin 3.2.3 </li></ul><br>  Denwer ... good old Denwer.  We see all the same meager set of not very fresh components (cut down on the very eggs), a black window and no GUI.  The advantages of this package include its extremely small size and a good ‚Äúknowledge base‚Äù on the forum, accumulated over many years.  Actually, the server is controlled by executing .BAT scripts for starting and stopping modules, as such, there is no control program at all. <br><br>  Denwer is extremely simple and straightforward, and therefore has the largest army of fans among the "dummies".  The most complete description of this platform will be the following phrase, said by one of the users: "Denver performs the main tasks and well, and the more lotions the more problems (no one does not use them at all 100)." <br><br><br><h4>  4. EasyPHP </h4><br>  Latest version: 5.3.9 <br>  Russian language: Yes <br>  Portable version: Yes <br>  Homepage: <a href="http://www.easyphp.org/">http://www.easyphp.org/</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/697/dd0/e9a/697dd0e9a494a88c958fa9d71647ec44.png" alt="EasyPHP"><br><br>  Basic set: <br><br><ul><li>  PHP 5.3.9 </li><li>  PhpMyAdmin 3.4.9 </li><li>  Apache 2.2.21 </li><li>  MySQL 5.5.20 </li></ul><br>  Pretty simple and unremarkable build.  We are offered a regular no-frills menu, simple settings and an intricate start page without the Russian language.  This software package did not make any impression on me, it works and that is good.  EasyPHP is quite suitable as a replacement for Denwer with a "version with windows" (if the start page is not scary). <br><br>  I note that EasyPHP manages the server on its own, no scary black windows pops up, the server is started and stopped fairly quickly. <br><br><h4>  5. EleanorServ </h4><br>  Latest version: 2.0.2.0 <br>  Is there Russian language <br>  Portable version: Yes <br>  Homepage: <a href="http://eleanor-cms.ru/server">http://eleanor-cms.ru/server</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bec/c77/0c3/becc770c343d1d29012512f409c6532f.png" alt="Eleanorserv"><br><br>  Basic set: <br><br><ul><li>  Apache 2.2.19 </li><li>  PHP 5.3.6 </li><li>  MySQL: MariaDB 5.2.6 </li><li>  PhpMyAdmin 3.4.2 </li><li>  SlimFTPd 3.1.81 </li><li>  DNS Unbound 1.4.10 </li></ul><br>  EleanorServ at first seemed to me a dark horse, or rather some kind of specialized server for the same name Eleanor CMS.  After reviewing it turned out that this is the usual WAMP kit. <br><br>  In this build, I liked the design of the menu, which turned out to be quite attractive, which is a big rarity among such programs.  I also liked the control panel, or rather the start page, which has a rather unusual performance. <br><br>  <s>After creating a new domain, the control panel simply disappeared</s> .  It turned out that there was an error in the domain manager, and it opens an incorrect address, but these are trifles.  Another disappointment was the inability to open the folder with domains from the tray menu, I had to look for where I installed EleanorServ ... <br><br>  In general, I liked EleanorServ, especially the ability to start / stop the server directly from the browser. <br><br><br><h4>  6. Nimp </h4><br>  Latest version: 1.5.0 <br>  Is there Russian language <br>  Portable version: Yes <br>  Homepage: <a href="http://nimpbox.ru/">http://nimpbox.ru/</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3ea/48c/447/3ea48c447712971c364b28e17d7646e8.png" alt="Nimp"><br><br>  Basic set: <br><br><ul><li>  Apache 2.2.17 </li><li>  Nginx 0.9.3 </li><li>  MySQL 5.5.8 </li><li>  PHP 5.3.5 </li><li>  Sendmail 31 </li><li>  phpMyAdmin 3.3.9 </li><li>  Sypex Dumper 2.0.8 </li><li>  FileZilla 0.9.37 beta </li><li>  Memcached 1.2.4 </li></ul><br>  Here we see an ugly implementation of the control panel with elements of pornography, but there is a rather interesting menu tray.  The strangest thing in this build is as much as 4!  tray icon with exactly the same menu.  I managed to make the server work far from the first time.  As it turned out, Nimp can only work from the root of the disk, which is without a doubt another fatty drawback of this software package. <br><br>  While using this assembly, something was constantly failing, FileZilla never stopped itself (it was necessary to kill through the task manager), and Memcached did not start at all.  Some puzzled by the words of the author of the program that "this assembly is perfect for highly loaded sites in corporate and urban networks," the program is clearly far from being used in a corporate environment. <br><br>  The ‚Äútrick‚Äù of this platform is that Nginx works as a frontend and is designed to distribute static content, while Apache works as a backend for generating dynamic content.  In general, my impression of this assembly remained twofold, it gradually changed from a sharply negative at first to normally acceptable in the process of working with the program. <br><br><br><h4>  7. Open Server </h4><br>  Latest version: 4.5.2 <br>  Is there Russian language <br>  Portable version: Yes <br>  Homepage: <a href="http://open-server.ru/">http://open-server.ru/</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e04/fdf/00d/e04fdf00d1434fbd6977b6b1041d3487.png" alt="Open server"><br><br>  Basic set: <br><br><ul><li>  Apache 2.2.22; </li><li>  Apache 2.4.2; </li><li>  Nginx 1.2.0; </li><li>  MySQL 5.1.63; </li><li>  MySQL 5.5.24; </li><li>  PostgreSQL 9.1.2; </li><li>  PHP 5.2.17 (IMagick 2.2.1, Zend Optimizer 3.3.3, IonCube Loader 4.0.7, Memcache 2.2.4); </li><li>  PHP 5.3.13 (IMagick 2.3.0, Xdebug 2.2.0, IonCube Loader 4.0.14, Memcache 2.2.6); </li><li>  PHP 5.4.3 (Xdebug 2.2.0); </li><li>  SlimFTPd 3.181; </li><li>  Fake sendmail 32; </li><li>  NNCron Lite 1.17; </li><li>  Memcached 1.2.6; </li><li>  Adminer 3.3.4; </li><li>  HeidiSQL 7.0; </li><li>  Webgrind 1.0; </li><li>  PHPMyAdmin 3.5.1; </li><li>  PHPPgAdmin 5.0.4; </li><li>  PHPMemcachedAdmin 1.2.1; </li></ul><br>  In contrast to other participants of our review, Open Server has the most pleasant and thoughtful interface, it has powerful features for setting up and administering components.  The undoubted advantages include support for settings profiles, switching HTTP / MySQL / PHP modules, task scheduler (cron), convenient management of domains and aliases, and for dummies there is an intelligent user guide. <br><br>  A nice feature of the Open Server is the ability to use the program as a portable personal start menu.  You can install the server on a USB drive, transfer your portable programs there, create bookmarks for frequently visited sites and wherever you are, you will have a convenient menu of quick access to your favorite sites and programs. <br><br><br><h4>  8. Server2go </h4><br>  Latest version: 1.8.2 <br>  Russian language: No <br>  Portable version: Yes <br>  Homepage: <a href="http://www.server2go-web.de/">http://www.server2go-web.de/</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/551/db6/7e4/551db67e40fbbe63955fa06a999f67f1.png" alt="Server2go"><br><br>  Basic set: <br><br><ul><li>  Apache 2.2 </li><li>  PHP 5.3.2 </li><li>  SQLITE </li><li>  MYSQL 5.1.46 </li><li>  PERL 5.8 </li></ul><br>  From this shit I spat for a long time and spent a few minutes looking for and killing child processes.  It turned out that when you start the Server2go program, the web server just starts and that's it.  EVERYTHING - in the literal sense of the word, there is no control program, no monitor, the server can neither be stopped nor even restarted.  All that this software package has is the start page where you can see innocuous information on the similarity of the PHP Info output. <br><br>  The impression is extremely negative, although it would seem: the server starts, PhpMyadmin opens, but what else do you need?  No, the server that cannot be stopped is not for me.  Burn it in hell! <br><br><br><h4>  9. Uniformserver </h4><br>  Latest version: 8.5.4 <br>  Russian language: Yes <br>  Portable version: No <br>  Homepage: <a href="http://www.uniformserver.com/">http://www.uniformserver.com/</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/dd5/e34/c25/dd5e34c250fcca745154824813153b58.png" alt="Uniformserver"><br><br>  Basic set: <br><br><ul><li>  Apache 2.4.2 </li><li>  PHP 5.4.0 </li><li>  MySQL 5.5.24 </li><li>  phpMyAdmin 3.5.1 </li></ul><br>  Uniformserver - this is another crafts on the knee and say at least something good about it, I can not.  A curved Russian translation, a huge ugly logo in the tray menu, the menu itself is not at all thought out, and because of the curved translation, it‚Äôs impossible to understand anything at all.  All that this build can do is start up and open PhpMyadmin.  Using the menu you can still get to the logs and configuration files.  The only pleasant surprise was to find Cron there. <br><br><br><h4>  10. USBWebserver </h4><br>  Latest version: 8.5 <br>  Russian language: No <br>  Portable version: Yes <br>  Homepage: <a href="http://www.usbwebserver.net/">http://www.usbwebserver.net/</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6a2/977/746/6a2977746a06dc348243f3501af99a77.png" alt="USBWebserver"><br><br>  Basic set: <br><br><ul><li>  Apache 2.2.21 </li><li>  MySQL 5.5 </li><li>  PHP 5.3.9 </li><li>  PhpMyAdmin 3.4.9.0 </li></ul><br>  Simple and easy WAMP kit.  The control panel is plain, it can be hidden in the tray.  Unfortunately there is no Russian language.  The assembly can be recommended to undemanding users and beginners.  There are no features or buns that I could talk about in this software package. <br><br>  In terms of its functionality, USBWebserver is similar to Denwer, except that Perl is not enough.  In the control panel, you can start / stop the modules, open the logs, there are still a couple of useful functions and settings, that's all.  I would recommend this build as a GUI replacement for Denwer, for those who need the same functionality, but I want to have a control panel with buttons and ruffles. <br><br><br><h4>  11. Vertrigo </h4><br>  Latest version: 2.27 <br>  Russian language: No <br>  Portable version: No <br>  Homepage: <a href="http://vertrigo.sourceforge.net/%3Flang%3Dru">http://vertrigo.sourceforge.net/</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4f2/297/56f/4f229756ff809459186f77fc3b51fdb6.png" alt="Vertrigo"><br><br>  Basic set: <br><br><ul><li>  Apache 2.2.22 </li><li>  PHP 5.3.10 </li><li>  MySQL 5.5.20 </li><li>  SQLite 3.7.10 </li><li>  Smarty 3.1.7 </li><li>  PhpMyAdmin 3.4.9 </li><li>  Xdebug 2.1.3 </li><li>  SQLiteManager 1.2.4 </li></ul><br>  A good and functional software package, fairly well-known, easy to learn.  It has a convenient menu, good features for configuring PHP and Apache.  I really liked the build, I used Vertrigo for quite a long time. <br><br>  But not everything is so rosy in our kingdom, of course, there are also disadvantages.  The most important and significant disadvantage is that Vertrigo is not portable, it cannot be installed on a USB flash drive and used on different machines.  Among other problems, I would like to point out the difficulties in creating a domain or alias, as well as the absence of the Russian language. <br><br><br><h4>  12. Wampserver </h4><br>  Latest version: 2.2d <br>  Russian language: Yes <br>  Portable version: No <br>  Homepage: <a href="http://www.wampserver.com/">http://www.wampserver.com/</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c56/20b/71b/c5620b71b80381ac5734427ba4d20c88.png" alt="Wampserver"><br><br>  Basic set: <br><br><ul><li>  Apache 2.2.21 </li><li>  Php 5.3.10 </li><li>  Mysql 5.5.20 </li><li>  XDebug 2.1.2 </li><li>  XDC 1.5 </li><li>  PhpMyadmin 3.4.10.1 </li><li>  SQLBuddy 1.3.3 </li><li>  webGrind 1.0 </li></ul><br>  Like XAMPP, this build is widely known in the west.  Perhaps the reason for this is the support of a large number of languages, the ability to install any version of Apache, MySQL and PHP as an add-on and an attractive homepage, which is not the case with the control program itself. <br><br>  The build works well, has a terrible, but quite understandable menu.  There is nothing in it that makes this local web server stand out from the crowd.  To be honest, I was very surprised to see such misery in the design of the program after visiting a stylish and colorful home page. <br><br><br><h4>  13. Winginx </h4><br>  Latest version: 0.4.0.4 <br>  Is there Russian language <br>  Portable version: Yes <br>  Homepage: <a href="http://winginx.ru/">http://winginx.ru/</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7d6/fb8/032/7d6fb80327de488467496de0f32b2003.png" alt="Winginx"><br><br>  Basic set: <br><br><ul><li>  Nginx 1.2.0; </li><li>  PHP 5.3.13; </li><li>  PHP 5.4.3; </li><li>  Node.js 0.6.17; </li><li>  MySQL 5.1.62; </li><li>  MongoDB 2.0.5; </li><li>  memcached 1.2.6; </li><li>  phpMyAdmin 3.5.0; </li><li>  Adminer 3.3.3; </li><li>  RockMongo 1.1.1; </li><li>  phpMemcachedAdmin 1.2.1; </li><li>  Xdebug 2.2.0.5, Zend Guard Loader 5.5, ionCube 4.0.14 </li></ul><br>  This build boasts the presence of MongoDB and Node.js, as well as the rapidly gaining popularity of the Nginx web server.  I was also pleased with the presence of a normal tray menu and settings section, but in the process, it turned out that the settings window has 3 tabs with only 1-2 options (why?). <br><br>  Oddly enough in Winginx work with logs looks.  To view them, we are offered a menu for selecting files of the form error.log, access.log, and so on, but which particular module these logs belong to is impossible to understand: Nginx, PHP, and maybe Node.js? <br><br>  Although Winginx has a control program, however, the command of the web server itself, as well as in Denwer, is done through .BAT files.  I made such a conclusion on black windows emerging from nowhere when starting or stopping the server. <br><br>  It is possible that someone (first of all, for beginners) will find the automatic installation of scripts (PhpBB, WordPress, Joomla, etc.) very useful when creating a domain, especially considering that the scripts are configured to work with Nginx (rewrite rules of rewrite itself pretty hard).  However, personally, I never use such functions and prefer to perform the installation myself, because you never know what is installed there and what surprises may await you in the future. <br><br><br><h4>  14. Xampp USB Lite </h4><br>  Latest version: 1.7.7 <br>  Russian language: No <br>  Portable version: Yes <br>  Homepage: <a href="http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp-windows.html">http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp-windows.html</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0cd/8a9/33c/0cd8a933caec1ef2e6967d788c60d3a3.png" alt="Xampp"><br><br>  Basic set: <br><br><ul><li>  Apache 2.2.21 </li><li>  MySQL 5.5.16 </li><li>  PHP 5.3.8 </li><li>  phpMyAdmin 3.4.5 </li></ul><br>  XAMPP is a very popular overseas software package.  I think the popularity is due to the fact that this build is quite reliable and has versions for all major operating systems: Windows, Linux, Mac OS X and even Solaris. <br><br>  The start and stop of the modules occur fairly quickly, the welcome page is not confused and understandable, albeit in English.  In general, a pretty good software package (with a bunch of buns in the desktop version) in which there is nothing superfluous or repulsive.  Black windows from the corner do not attack, the control panel is quite normal, but not very useful. <br><br>  Of the minuses of this software package, I can point out just this control panel, or rather the absence of this control itself, there is nothing in it except for starting and stopping the server.  There is no convenient menu with a list of sites, there is no web server settings section, there are no useful tools.  You have to manually configure the working environment in this build. <br><br><br><h4>  Comparison </h4><table><tbody><tr><th></th><th>  Portable </th><th>  Russian language </th><th>  GUI availability </th><th>  Useful GUI </th><th>  View logs </th></tr><tr><td>  Ampps </td><td>  - </td><td>  + </td><td>  + </td><td>  - </td><td>  + </td></tr><tr><td>  Appserv </td><td>  - </td><td>  - </td><td>  - </td><td>  - </td><td>  - </td></tr><tr><td>  Denwer </td><td>  + </td><td>  + </td><td>  - </td><td>  - </td><td>  - </td></tr><tr><td>  EasyPHP </td><td>  + </td><td>  + </td><td>  + </td><td>  + </td><td>  + </td></tr><tr><td>  Eleanorserv </td><td>  + </td><td>  + </td><td>  + </td><td>  + </td><td>  + </td></tr><tr><td>  Nimp </td><td>  + </td><td>  + </td><td>  + </td><td>  + </td><td>  - </td></tr><tr><td>  Open server </td><td>  + </td><td>  + </td><td>  + </td><td>  + </td><td>  + </td></tr><tr><td>  Server2go </td><td>  + </td><td>  - </td><td>  - </td><td>  - </td><td>  - </td></tr><tr><td>  Uniformserver </td><td>  - </td><td>  + </td><td>  + </td><td>  - </td><td>  + </td></tr><tr><td>  USBWebserver </td><td>  + </td><td>  - </td><td>  + </td><td>  - </td><td>  - </td></tr><tr><td>  Vertrigo </td><td>  - </td><td>  - </td><td>  + </td><td>  + </td><td>  + </td></tr><tr><td>  Wampserver </td><td>  - </td><td>  + </td><td>  + </td><td>  + </td><td>  + </td></tr><tr><td>  Winginx </td><td>  + </td><td>  + </td><td>  + </td><td>  + </td><td>  + </td></tr><tr><td>  Xampp usb lite </td><td>  + </td><td>  - </td><td>  + </td><td>  - </td><td>  - </td></tr></tbody></table>  Best results: EasyPHP, Open Server, Winginx. <br><br><br><h4>  Testing </h4><br>  <b>Test number 1 - False start</b> <br><br>  The essence of the test lies in deliberately spoiling the Apache configuration in order to check whether we receive any warning or all the indicators will turn green and nothing will work.  Agree to use an assembly that deceptively reports a successful launch and makes you an idiot, little desire.  If the server does not give any signals or works covertly, then the test will also be considered failed. <br><br>  <b>Test 2 - Difficult Ways</b> <br><br>  The essence of the test is to deliberately install the server in a folder with a complex name, in our test we will use a folder called ‚ÄúC: \ test \ Mys $ ka! ._- () zlo {} + ~% &amp; 2% Files‚Äù.  If PhpMyAdmin (it is taken just for convenience, as it is in each assembly) does not open, then the test will fail accordingly.  Each person is an individuality, folders are sometimes called the most unexpected names.  The folder name selected for the test is correct for Windows and must be properly processed. <br><br>  <b>Test number 3 - SSL out of the box</b> <br><br>  The test is extremely simple - we start the server and try to open PhpMyAdmin using the SSL protocol. <br><br>  <b>Notation:</b> ‚Äú+‚Äù means that the test was successful, ‚Äú-‚Äù means that the test failed. <br><table><tbody><tr><th></th><th>  False start </th><th>  Difficult paths </th><th>  SSL out of the box </th></tr><tr><td>  Ampps </td><td>  + </td><td>  + </td><td>  + </td></tr><tr><td>  Appserv </td><td>  - </td><td>  + </td><td>  - </td></tr><tr><td>  Denwer </td><td>  - </td><td>  + </td><td>  + </td></tr><tr><td>  EasyPHP </td><td>  + </td><td>  + </td><td>  - </td></tr><tr><td>  Eleanorserv </td><td>  + </td><td>  + </td><td>  - </td></tr><tr><td>  Nimp </td><td>  + </td><td>  - </td><td>  - </td></tr><tr><td>  Open server </td><td>  + </td><td>  + </td><td>  + </td></tr><tr><td>  Server2go </td><td>  - </td><td>  + </td><td>  - </td></tr><tr><td>  Uniformserver </td><td>  + </td><td>  - </td><td>  - </td></tr><tr><td>  USBWebserver </td><td>  + </td><td>  - </td><td>  - </td></tr><tr><td>  Vertrigo </td><td>  + </td><td>  + </td><td>  - </td></tr><tr><td>  Wampserver </td><td>  + </td><td>  + </td><td>  - </td></tr><tr><td>  Winginx </td><td>  - </td><td>  - </td><td>  - </td></tr><tr><td>  Xampp usb lite </td><td>  + </td><td>  - </td><td>  + </td></tr></tbody></table>  Best results: AMPPS, Open Server. <br><br><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4><br>  Having examined and tested so many software systems, the question arises - what is the ultimate choice for everyday work?  It is not so easy to answer this question, each assembly will be good for a specific type of task. <br><br>  For beginners, I suggest using Denwer, as the easiest and time-tested WAMP kit.  For all other web developers, as well as for those newbies who do not have enough Denwer functionality, I recommend using Open Server. <br><br>  If you need to quickly familiarize yourself with any well-known script, forum, photo gallery or guest book and do not want to bother with installing it and finding a suitable platform, you can try AMPPS.  Of course, provided that the script you are interested in is supported by this development. <br><br>  If someone needs to use such rare modules as a local mail server, Node.js, MongoDB, etc., then I think everyone will be able to choose a suitable option among the other participants in our review. <br><br>  PS The opinion of the author is based on superficial communication with each assembly and may not reflect some of the advantages or hidden disadvantages of any of the platforms that were not revealed in the process of work. <br><br>  PPS I want to warn commentators who advocate a virtual machine with Linux on board and no longer recognize anything as an alternative.  In part, I agree with you, when transferring a site to a real hosting, some problems may arise: streams, fs rights, symlinks, console, etc. <br><br>  However, look at it from the other side.  Such problems are special cases and they occur quite rarely.  In reality, the opposite is true - the template maker on the Smarty engine does not need to know anything about streams, simlinks and the console, and the CMS developers have already learned 100 years how to set the correct write rights to downloadable files. <br><br>  As a result, I want to say that WAMP platforms have the right to exist and the use of virtual machines in most cases is completely unjustified. <br><br>  <b>More WAMP builds (from comments):</b> <br>  <a href="http://zwamp.sourceforge.net/">Z-WAMP</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.uwamp.com/">UwAmp</a> <br>  <a href="http://bitnami.org/stack/wampstack">Bitnami WAMP Stack</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/144242/">https://habr.com/ru/post/144242/</a></p>
