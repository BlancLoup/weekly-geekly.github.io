      If you have many contacts / friends, you can share ads with them for hire. <br><br>  How to find out whether the search for personnel in social networks is effective. <br>  Everything is relative. <br><br>  For comparison, you need to place a real ad on the working site and at the same time start searching for personnel in social networks. <br><br>  After some time, evaluate the effectiveness of both search methods. <br><br>  So I did. <br><br><h2>  Benchmarking - Headhunter vs Team Social Networks </h2><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Since the real announcement about the hiring of a personnel director was used as a ‚Äútest job‚Äù, I managed to get by with minimal effort to post a job on social networks. <br><br>  Participation in professional HR-communities, as well as in special groups in which vacancies are published, made it possible not to waste time searching for groups and joining them to post vacancies. <br><br>  Immediately I will note an important point - we are talking only about publishing an advertisement for hiring in social networks and distributing it in your personal network of contacts / friends. <br><br>  I did not search for accounts and send out personal messages and requests for repost ‚Äî this is serious and time-consuming work, the implementation of which in the framework of this project was inappropriate. <br><br>  As for the publication of an advertisement for hiring on a working site, I used the standard ad on hh.ru worth 700 rubles. <br><br><h2>  What networks were used to search for staff </h2><br>  First of all, Facebook and Linkedin. <br><br>  Why they?  In my opinion, the target audience to which my ad is addressed is most widely represented on these networks. <br><br>  The total number of participants in Facebook groups in which the vacancy was placed - 15-20 thousand people, 25-35 thousand - Linkedin.  The total number of personal contacts that could see a job is 3,500 on Facebook and 10,000 on Linkedin. <br><br>  In both networks, I placed an advertisement for hiring on my own page, HR-PRACTICE pages, communities of the same name, as well as in professional groups and special groups for posting vacancies. <br><br>  For the purity of the experiment, I used Vkontakte and Odnoklassniki, but they limited myself to publishing an advertisement about hiring only on my pages and in professional groups. <br><br>  Despite the impressive number of participants of the groups on the topics ‚ÄúJobs, vacancies‚Äù of Vkontakte and Odnoklassniki, I didn‚Äôt risk placing the ‚ÄúHR Director‚Äù vacancy in them - the neighborhood with the vacancies of salesmen and sales managers seemed to me inappropriate. <br><br><h2>  Summarizing </h2><br>  The team of social networks shamefully lost to the traditional Headhunter. <br><br>  As responses to the e-mail address indicated in the announcement on social networks, only 34 resumes were received, while Headhunter ‚Äúshot‚Äù 548 of them. <br><br>  The actual performance of social networks turned out to be zero, which was understandable given the fact that Headhunter‚Äôs efficiency ratio in this project was about 3%. <br><br><h2>  Hypotheses </h2><br>  I don‚Äôt suggest that anyone consider the result obtained by me in one comparative test a regularity. <br><br>  Many experts use social networks to search for employees, perhaps someone has other results. <br><br>  Some colleagues from the IT-sphere consider social networks to be a much more effective tool than working sites, although, taking into account the fact that search is not limited only to the publication of a vacancy. <br><br>  I try to reflect on why my experience was so unfortunate. <br><br>  The first thing that comes to mind is the association with the fence on which ads are posted. <br><br>  Headhunter's fence is always in the same place, everyone knows that it is hanging on it, go to it with a specific purpose and can find the right ad using the search form. <br><br>  If you posted an ad on hh.ru, then nobody will break it for a month - everyone will read it. <br><br>  As for social networks with their constantly scrolling tape from a variety of content, then you can see an ad on this fence rather by chance than purposefully. <br><br>  The search engine, unlike hh.ru, does not equip this fence, moreover, it does not actually stand still, but constantly moves. <br><br>  And this fence itself decides to whom and what ads to show - I mean content ranking algorithms in social networks. <br><br>  Not all visitors to social networks are looking for work.  This explains why even a large audience does not make the publication of the announcement effective. <br><br><h2>  Conclusion </h2><br>  I hope my experience will be useful to you. <br><br>  If you know the secret of how to use social networks more effectively - share them in the comments to this material. <br><br>  I wish you success and good luck in finding staff. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/300786/">https://habr.com/ru/post/300786/</a></p>
