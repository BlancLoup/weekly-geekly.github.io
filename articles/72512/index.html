The first is hiring people for permanent employment, the second is the use of freelancers.  Is it possible to combine the positive qualities of these very different approaches, while getting rid of the shortcomings? <br><br>  I think it is possible.  And, moreover, that the conditions for this in some companies already exist.  So, <a name="habracut"></a>  to decide what we want to save, and get rid of, consider the pros and cons of each approach. <br><br><br><h3>  Freelance vs.  permanent employment </h3><br>  <b>Advantages of permanent employment:</b> <br><ul><li>  Guaranteed income (and other buns) </li><li>  A team of professionals around, who has to learn from experience and skills </li><li>  Participation in large projects </li></ul><br>  <b>Disadvantages of permanent employment:</b> <br><ul><li>  Lack of motivation </li><li>  Low interest in the development of an individual employee </li><li>  Lower (comparative) labor efficiency </li><li>  The ‚ÄúI'm the boss, you are a fool‚Äù relationship model is of little use for IT, where people are notable for their intelligence by definition. </li><li>  Low employee loyalty </li><li>  Narrow specialization - code, code and code.  Although many are not averse to express themselves in some other way. </li><li>  Fixed working day - although there are variations, it‚Äôs all the same - having worked 12 hours on the same day, the next one is welcome to the office </li></ul><br>  <b>Advantages of freelancing:</b> <br><ul><li>  Strong motivation for effective work (as you will sink - and you will burst :) </li><li>  The ability to vary the ratio of "income-free time" at its discretion </li><li>  A responsibility </li><li>  Additional skills that appear due to the need to communicate with the customer </li><li>  When working with a freelancer, the company has the opportunity to transfer some of its risks. </li><li>  The need for a freelancer in the constant acquisition of new knowledge </li></ul><br>  <b>Cons freelancing:</b> <br><ul><li>  The risk of being left without orders for an indefinite period </li><li>  Unknown to potential customers </li><li>  Work on typical tasks in small projects </li></ul>

    <h3>  Peace, friendship, chewing gum </h3><br>  So how can you make full-time freelance friends? <br><br>  To do this, it is enough to introduce in the team relations on the principle of the free market: <br><ol><li>  At the beginning of the project we recruit contractors - team members.  The scope of work and remuneration negotiated with each separately. </li><li>  We set a bonus for everyone for early completion (the size is determined <b>individually</b> ), and penalties for failure to meet the deadlines (hello. Motivation, thank God you came! :) </li><li>  Well, we also determine the rate for work performed outside the agreed framework of the project. </li></ol><br><br>  <b>What is the result?</b> <br><br>  A sense of responsibility and motivation is rising. <br><br>  Risks for the project are shared and transferred to contractors. <br><br>  Your boss is your customer.  Teach team members to interact. <br><br>  The employee himself will be able to vary his load-income. <br><br>  A person begins to do something not out of fear of sticking with the boss, but because he himself has agreed and must now answer for his obligations. <br><br>  There is a normal business motivation - the desire to establish long-term relationships with the customer, so that orders will fall to you in the future (taken into projects). <br><br>  I want to improve the quality and efficiency of work in order to be able to raise my price in the future. <br><br>  <b>Restrictions</b> <br><br>  It is clear that this will work only if PM has the authority to manage the budget and determine the composition of the team. <br><br>  In addition, in order to reasonably agree on the scope of work and remuneration, the TK should be worked out in detail.  Those.  can be used in RUP.  And in Agile (Scrum) to negotiate anew at each iteration (by the way, if you set the iteration length per month, then you can simplify financial issues). <br>  Skill requirements for the next iteration can be published so that people can plan their employment for the next period.  Well, there is a lot more to do ... <br><br><h3>  findings </h3><br>  What is the net remnant? <br>  They removed the cons of freelancing: you know the customers within the company, and whether it will depend on you to take you to interesting projects;  We work in large projects, according to their level. <br>  The minuses of permanent employment were removed: everyone became quasi-freelancers and received an upgrade of motivation and responsibility. <br><br>  In general, everything looks very rosy: every employee is a company to himself.  And the strength of the whole company lies in the unity of its strong employee companies. <br><br>  Obviously, this approach will work best for companies with a design organization.  Although it will also come down for operational activities - employees are able to perform the functions of service contractors, stipulating their activities and remuneration for a certain period. <br><br>  But without sure, we can‚Äôt do without it - so that the upper ranks want, and the lower classes can.  In the sense that the management must understand that it will be necessary to work in a new way.  And they wanted it.  You won't be able to pull Vasya and say ‚Äúdo it,‚Äù and then after an hour ‚Äúno, better do that‚Äù.  And the bottoms - that is, the employees, should be able to crawl out of the cozy swamp and try themselves in the real world (Morpheus, I‚Äôm blue, but more, more :) <br><br>  You can start with a part of the collective - the center of crystallization - to which you gradually connect the rest. <br><br>  Of course, there are questions.  For example, how to deal with bugs (the contractor gives a guarantee on your code)?  Or how to keep people who have received a new degree of freedom, from going to free swimming? <br><br>  There are many of them, but I want to think about this approach, it seems to me very promising.  And I want to analyze it from all sides.  Therefore, the question to the community is - what problems might arise?  Or vice versa - unexpected advantages. <br><br>  Maybe someone already uses / used a similar approach - what kind of reviews? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/72512/">https://habr.com/ru/post/72512/</a></p>
