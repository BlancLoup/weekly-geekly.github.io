  <section class="page js-page"><h1>ABC novice Symbian OS user</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><h2>  Attention! </h2><br>  This article is aimed at people who for one reason or another are owners of smartphones based on Symbian OS, but in spite of this they use their device exclusively to <strike>open beer traffic jams</strike> .  The article contains elements of the neglect of the copyrights of some foreign software firms, but given my extremely good intentions, I allow myself such a weakness.  In the end, if you want to buy this or that software - no one holds you.  For example, I have about 30% of the software honestly bought (for I really need it), 60% is free, and only 10% is Varese, for which I refuse to pay in principle, due to the discrepancy between price and quality. <br><br>  I, with the assistance and supplying me with the necessary supply of provisions and very stimulating (admittedly, very) kicks from my unforgettable comrade whose name is Oleg, I write an article-manual, such as the alphabet of a beginner smart lead, which will help him (smart lead) to understand the elements of a smart connection and It is worthy to make these beautiful devices as it should be rightfully.  How is it?  Hehe ... One day I saw my old friend.  He is such an average user recording user, kodit even a little on python (just for fan) ... So, he asked me to help him master the new gadget (which he did not want to learn from his innate pathological laziness with God and (or) Google).  Well, I helped the man to the EU, but how could I say no more.  And thought.  But how many people have a smartphone at their disposal, but due to the laziness / lack of time, they don‚Äôt even want to use it.  Maybe among habranaroda there are such?  Here in today's article I will tell you about how to make something out of a lifeless piece of iron on meringue Symbian OS that is not a shame, and even a pleasure to use. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Today I will tell you, habrachelovek, about the <strong>S60 3rd Edition</strong> (tobish Symbian 9.1 / 9.2 / 9.3).  And about the veteran axes I will tell you another time (if there will of course be willing to read).  Just in case you, habrachelovek, forgot, I will remind you - that yes on what.

What to do?  How to use it?  Can it be used to enslave the parallel worlds?  From what angle should it be kept to open a beer without strong damage for him and for the final product? <br><br>  To understand the philosophy of the nine, you need to immediately understand a couple of simple things so that everything falls into place. <br><br>  Unlike previous versions of Symbian (hereinafter referred to as the veteran axes), cunning guys made us a little dirty trick, namely, they cut down access to the file system (hereinafter FS), breaking all users into 3 castes. <br><br><img src="http://img136.imageshack.us/img136/7357/screenshot0033xe0.jpg" align="left">  Ideally, it should have been like this - Each device has its own level of "openness" (capabilitis).  The most severe - a very narrow caste with the highest level of capabilitis - full, which (# 1) have full access to all restricted to foreign sections of the FS.  There is also a group of those (No. 2) who by hook or by crook received the opportunity to view closed sections in read mode.  Well, the most common caste (‚Ññ 3) - those who have only an abstract idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe closed FS koluars of their device. <br><br>  But, naturally, the brave guys from all over the world could not come to terms with this injustice, and within a year they decided to face this dilemma.  Today, any user of the nine can get full access in a couple of minutes by resorting to the crack of the system.  Why is it good to be the owner of a croaked smartphone?  Well, first of all, there is no need to sign unregistered officially and not received a certificate from Nokia applications.  You must admit that the prospect of receiving a certificate so that everyone could use the icon you made - does not inspire optimism.  You can of course get a personal certificate (under IMEI) and sign each such application to them, but, again, this is an extra hemorrhoid which can be avoided.  Yes, and there are still a couple of fitchies, for the sake of fun, koi should be tried (see screenshot). <br><br><h2>  We broke, we broke - and we are not ashamed, yes. </h2><br><br>  So, the first thing you need to hack your device.  For this you need <a href="http://depositfiles.com/files/67uyxkfwv">QuickHackKit</a> .  Immediately I warn you - this does not work on the latest firmware.  See the guys from Nokia are also not asleep. <br><br>  <b>At the moment, do not break:</b> <br>  - N82 from 30 firmware <br>  - 6120 from 6.01 <br>  - 5320 from 3.26 <br>  - 6110 Navigator from 6.01 <br>  - 6220 from 3.23 <br>  - E66 from 110 <br>  - E71 from 110 <br>  - E90 from 300 <br><br>  <b>Can not hack at all</b> <br>  - N79 <br>  - N85 <br>  - N96 <br><br>  You can find out the version of your firmware simply by typing * # 0000 # and pressing the call key.  (The result on the screenshot above is optional;)) <br><br>  Without hesitation, stupidly skopipastil instructions for <a href="http://depositfiles.com/files/67uyxkfwv">QuickHackKit</a> .  Better not vseravno tell. <br><br><blockquote> QuickHackKit is the easiest and fastest way to hack your smartphone. <br>  Install sis, click on the icon, wait a couple of seconds, reboot the phone and everything is ready! <br>  Package allows you to install <br>  1) BiNPDA SecMan (You can install the root certificate (Leftup plus BiNPDA) for N-Gage 2 games and applications and disable the verification capability) <br>  2) InstallServer (for installing unsigned applications and expired certificates) <br>  3) Ldd driver for CapsOff and CapsOn (to disable capability if you don‚Äôt want to use the sekman) <br>  All components are independent of each other.  Ie if you are only interested in the installer, then leave a tick only on it.  and that's it! <br>  During the installation, you will be asked to choose the version of InstallServer.  We leave a tick on only one version. <br>  There may be three ticks in total (SecMan, one of the installers and a driver for your axis). All three components are independent of each other! <br>  When choosing the version of the installserver, navigate so <br>  If you have 9.2 or 9.3, then the 100% version will go from it. <br>  If you have 3250, E50, H80, try versions from 9.1, E50, E61, 3250 and 5500. From 9.2 do not even try. <br>  MUST BECOME SECMAN if you do not know which version of the install server is right for you.  So you can then carry the wrong version. <br>  If the file is written corrupted, you need to press Turn Plat sec Off in the Secman and then delete it via X-plore sys / bin / installserver.exe <br>  Attention!  This is a test version, laid out specifically to see how it works on other phones.  If everything will be fine, then after a small refinement lay out the final version. <br>  After completing the procedure in the application manager, you can remove QuickHackKit.  It does not affect what is established. <br>  This is a modification of SecMan 1.1 from BiNPDA.  For which they are very grateful. <br></blockquote><br><br>  If everything turned out - we dance and rejoice.  If not - do not despair, try again a bit later. <br><br><h2>  Gentleman's set </h2><br><br>  If you have become the happy owner of a hacked device (it will be more politically correct to say unlocked, um), you will need the necessary minimum of software, which I will try to explain below.  If the file is marked with a sign - <strong>[P],</strong> this does not mean at all that you will have to suffer with it for a long time, just for its work you need an interpreter of the Python language (which is what I will say further).  And if it is marked with the <strong>[L]</strong> icon <strong>,</strong> then to install it you need to either unlock the smart (which we have already done, right?), Or sign it with a personal certificate obtained from our Chinese friends from OPDA. <br><br><h3>  <a href="http://trashbox.ru/link/x-plore-symbian">X-Plore 1.30</a> </h3><br><br><img height="273" src="http://img168.imageshack.us/img168/4691/xplore1ox4.jpg" width="205" align="left"><img height="274" src="http://img168.imageshack.us/img168/8960/xplore3fo2.jpg" width="206" align="left"><br>  <a href="http://trashbox.ru/link/x-plore-symbian">X-Plore</a> is the best file manager for Symbian.  There are certainly analogs, but in terms of usability, functionality and convenience - this is the case when the competitors are far behind.  Conditionally free.  Conditionally - because after each inclusion of the free version, you need to wait out the 3-second window, which is not very intrusive.  It has a built-in hex editor (see screenshot), a primitive player of audio and video files (which is very convenient!), Well, if you watch images.  Also can work with text files.  But with .doc and .docx for now - read only.  Irreplaceable software.
