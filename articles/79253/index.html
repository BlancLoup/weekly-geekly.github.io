For boiling. <br><br>  I have been with Qwerty for more than three years. <br>  During this time it was all.  And the hardest transition to neonet and technical support attempts to dump the problems on my computer, allegedly for viruses. <br>  But all this was a long time ago and quite tolerant. <br>  And I used and rejoiced in my quite quite tolerable Internet. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  However, <b>since October 2008,</b> something began that cannot be called ugliness. <br>  The killing of p2p traffic began, I already <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/p2p/71491/">wrote</a> about this, specifically torrent traffic, for a year now ‚Äúthe company is looking for other methods‚Äù, but the situation has not returned to the status quo, which is not observed.  At the same time, the company rejected the whole month until November. <br>  <b>Since the Summer of 2009,</b> Qwerty every month, and sometimes several times, the DNS begins to fall, the Internet has simply turned into a dial-up.  Someone suffered, someone left, and someone was technically savvy, like me, changed the standard DNS to others.  Qwerty also had other glands, the fall of which paralyzed the work of most of the network.  And technical support couldn‚Äôt do anything about it, she just didn‚Äôt answer, she was out.  that is, getting through the phone by phone was simply unrealistic.  This story will continue to this day.  For example: on December 8, Qwerty DNS collapsed again.  And none other than the day before, on December 23, the network was paralyzed for 12 hours, the problem was eliminated by noon on December 24th.  It does not take 2 weeks so that the network does not lag.

      If you think that this is all, you are mistaken. <br>  <b>Going further:</b> <br>  Over the past year, QWERTY from a normal provider has become an acado for which, the main priority is digital TV, go to the Qwerty website, <a href="http://qwerty.ru/news">read the news</a> .  You will see that 80% of news for the year, exclusively about Digital TV.  New channels are added, new packages are formed.  And do not say that this is Triple play, this is a clear bias towards TV. <br>  Meanwhile, <b>Teleq</b> , a service with which you can watch channels without a set-top box, works only on <b>Windows XP</b> <br>  Meanwhile, the tariffs have not changed for almost a year and a half almost, and already morally obsolete.  Half a year we are promised a revision of tariffs, but so far nothing has happened. <br><br>  <b>A small comparison:</b> <br>  For 650 rubles in the biline, you can get 12 megabits ( <a href="">pruflink</a> ) in Qwerty for the same amount, even 10 rubles more expensive, only 8.5.  12 megabits in the biline is not an extreme speed, whereas in Qwerty this is the limit, there is no unlimited further, and the limits are extremely unprofitable.  And it costs 12 megabits in Qwerty from 850 to 950 rubles, depending on the tariff.  That is a benefit to the face.  Well, let's say this is a VPN, this is a bad technology, but in the NBN for 650 rubles you can get 10 megabits, and this is not the limit. <br><br>  Qwerty is famous for its tracker, but why do I need it?  When I can have 10-12 megabits and calmly download from other resources, without killing. <br><br>  If you can‚Äôt provide a normal upload to subscribers, do it like on-line, <b>officially</b> , showing in the tariffs that, yes, we‚Äôre cutting and not surreptitiously, that until you enter the forum, you don‚Äôt even know why the rating on the tracker began to fall. <br><br>  Today, the Quartie forum is Akado + Stream.  TV plus slain uplink, but stream at least openly warns of restrictions. <br><br>  The provider has long been promising promotions for "old subscribers". But until today, this has not happened. <br><br>  So, even in the capital, the Internet is not super. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/79253/">https://habr.com/ru/post/79253/</a></p>
