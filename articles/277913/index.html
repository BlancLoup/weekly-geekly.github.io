Initially, at the institute she was engaged in collecting data and searching for literature. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4e0/894/d1c/4e0894d1ca4244e8aa7641da3dccaef3.jpg"><br><br>  The first task for Elizabeth in the Engelbart team was to write a Resource Handbook for the first ARPANET demonstration at the International Computer Communication Conference. <br><br><h4>  Nic </h4><br>  By 1972, <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/edison/blog/277803/">when the glorious team was developing the world's first personal computer, the Xerox Alto</a> , it led the working group to create a new <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InterNIC">Network Information Center (NIC)</a> for ARPANET. <br><br><blockquote>  <i>‚ÄúThe NIC looked like prehistoric Google,‚Äù</i> says Elizabeth.  <i>‚ÄúPeople turned to us for any question.‚Äù</i> </blockquote><br><br>  The center gave users information about people, organizations (similar to the ‚Äúyellow pages‚Äù), communication was carried out by regular mail and telephone.  Later communication was carried out through e-mail on nodes ARPANET. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b94/4b0/c04/b944b0c04dda4dfb8202e31dfba18e02.jpg"><br><br>  Feinler, along with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Crocker">Steve Crocker</a> , <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Postel">Jon Postel</a> , <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joyce_K._Reynolds">Joyce Reynolds</a> and other members of the Network Working Group (NWG), developed <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/RFC">RFC (Request for Comments, Work Offer)</a> - a series of numbered information documents containing technical specifications and standards for ARPANET and then for the Internet. <br><br><h4>  RFC </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f28/965/271/f289652718433d1f3e1dfbb452b490cd.jpg" alt="image" align="right">  The RFC format appeared in 1969 when discussing the draft ARPANET. <br><br>  <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1">RFC 1</a> was published on April 7, 1969 and was called ‚ÄúHost Software‚Äù. <br><br>  The first RFCs were distributed in printed form on paper in the form of ordinary letters, but since December 1969, when the first segments of the ARPANET were launched, documents began to be distributed electronically. <br><br>  Most of the early RFCs were created at the University of California, Los Angeles and the Stanford Research Institute. <br><br>  From 1969 to 1998  the permanent and only RFC editor was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Postel">John Postel</a> .  After his death, the Internet Society ( <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISOC">ISOC</a> ) entrusted the editing and publication of RFCs to the Institute of Information Sciences.  University of Southern California. <br><br>  Essay on the history of RFC for 30 years from 1969 to 1999.  is presented in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2555">RFC 2555</a> . <br><br><h4>  WhoIs and domain names </h4><br>  In 1974, Elizabeth with the working group developed a short textual naming of hosts ( <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc608">Host names on-line</a> ). <br><br>  In ARPANET, the host owner had to send an email to HOSTSMASTER@SRI-NIC.ARPA to request an address.  The HOSTS.TXT file was distributed by the efforts of the NIC employees and was manually installed on each host in the network in order to provide communication (mapping) between all network addresses. <br>  Later, the research team worked on scaling and the functions of the NIC were taken over by the WhoIs and DNS services. <br><br>  Thanks to Feinler, there is a modern domain name system (.com, .gov, .org, .mil). <br><br>  In 1989, Feinler went to work at NASA at the Ames Research Center.  She retired in 1996 and in 2010 published the <a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/icp.jsp%3Farnumber%3D5551028">history of the NIC</a> .  In 2012, she entered the Internet Hall of Fame. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/stmlMH__sro%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700043,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhiJY4PxVjhjb5Q_TzZqJFlUrVCBkg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <a href="http://www.wired.com/2012/06/elizabeth-jake-feinler/">Article about Elizabeth</a> in WIRED <br>  <a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/icp.jsp%3Farnumber%3D5551028">The Network Information Center and its Archives</a> <br>  <a href="https://www.sri.com/about/alumni/alumni-hall-fame-2000">Elizabeth at</a> Stanford University <a href="https://www.sri.com/about/alumni/alumni-hall-fame-2000">Hall of</a> Fame <br><br>  <b>Today is Elizabeth's birthday.</b> <br><br><hr><br><br>  Together with the company <a href="http://www.edsd.ru/">Edison we</a> start the spring marathon of publications. <br><br>  I will try to get to the primary sources of IT-technologies, to understand how they thought and what concepts were in the minds of the pioneers, what they dreamed about, how they saw the world of the future.  Why did you think ‚Äúcomputer‚Äù, ‚Äúnetwork‚Äù, ‚Äúhypertext‚Äù, ‚Äúintelligence amplifiers‚Äù, ‚Äúcollective problem solving system‚Äù, what meaning did they put into these concepts, what tools they wanted to achieve a result. <br><br>  I hope that these materials will serve as an inspiration for those who are wondering how to go <a href="https://megamozg.ru/post/2408/">‚Äúfrom Zero to Unit‚Äù</a> (to create something that had never happened before).  I would like IT and ‚Äúprogramming‚Äù to stop being just ‚Äúcoding for the sake of dough‚Äù, and recall that they were conceived as a lever to change the <s>methods of warfare,</s> education, a way of working together, thinking and communication, as an attempt to solve world problems and answer facing humanity.
