  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Intellect, language and WikiPedia - is there a relationship?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/39d/b38/437/39db38437ebe137ee3e85a3bae30592d.jpg" align="right">  The fact that the intellect of a person depends on his skin color or, more precisely, on a race has already been tested and proved more than once, both by scientific experiments and by the most objective expert in this matter - the history of Man himself.  Thus, according to scientific studies, the average IQ for Asians is about 106, for whites - about 100, for blacks - from 85 in the United States to 70 in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãso-called Black Africa. <br>  Such results were obtained, despite the fact that IQ tests were initially developed by whites and for whites. <br><br>  The genetic architecture of IQ is about the same for all races and mainly depends on heredity. <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/062/4c8/e02/0624c8e0228863d45a33dfb07c0b1903.jpg" align="right">  Researchers who examined a certain number of twins of the Negroid, Mongoloid, and Caucasoid races, concluded that hereditary factors account for 50% of the weight in the formation of intelligence.  The remaining 50% responsible for the formation of intelligence accounts for external factors.  One of which is language.  It is precisely the language that will be devoted to our further quasi-research. <br><br>  As the initial data set for the study, we take statistics on the number of articles published in WikiPedia in various languages ‚Äã‚Äãover the past 5 years. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><table><tbody><tr><td></td><td>  <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/">2009</a> </td><td>  <a href="http://wikipedia.org/">2010</a> </td><td>  <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/">2011</a> </td><td>  <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/">2012</a> </td><td>  <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/">2013</a> </td><td>  The relative increase in the number of articles in 5 years has increased </td><td>  The absolute increase in the number of articles in 5 years has increased </td></tr><tr><td>  English articles, thousands </td><td>  2847 </td><td>  3290 </td><td>  3645 </td><td>  3907 </td><td>  4230 </td><td>  1.49 </td><td>  1383 </td></tr><tr><td>  German, thousand </td><td>  894 </td><td>  1066 </td><td>  1236 </td><td>  1383 </td><td>  1580 </td><td>  1.77 </td><td>  686 </td></tr><tr><td width="150">  French, thousand </td><td width="50">  792 </td><td width="50">  947 </td><td width="50">  1106 </td><td width="50">  1230 </td><td width="50">  1380 </td><td>  1.74 </td><td>  588 </td></tr><tr><td>  Italian thousand </td><td>  560 </td><td>  687 </td><td>  803 </td><td>  905 </td><td>  1030 </td><td>  1.84 </td><td>  470 </td></tr><tr><td>  Spanish, thousand </td><td>  465 </td><td>  596 </td><td>  761 </td><td>  879 </td><td>  1010 </td><td>  2.17 </td><td>  545 </td></tr><tr><td>  Russian, tyss </td><td>  380 </td><td>  534 </td><td>  714 </td><td>  838 </td><td>  1000 </td><td>  2.63 </td><td>  620 </td></tr></tbody></table><br>  The study will be conducted on the example of the main languages ‚Äã‚Äãof the white race for several reasons.  First, the white race shows the average IQ between the Negroids and the Mongoloids.  Secondly, China, as the main representative of the Mongoloid race since 2004, has blocked access to WikiPedia to its users, and consequently, its numbers will not be sufficiently objective.  Third, representatives of the Negroid race are represented on the Web in a completely non-representative volume. <br>  As can be seen from the table, the absolute record for the number of published articles is English.  This, literally, outstanding result is due not only to the fact that English is the third after Chinese and Spanish in terms of the prevalence of the language in the world ( <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A1%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BA_%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B5_%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D1%2581%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D1%2591%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D1%2585_%25D1%258F%25D0%25B7%25D1%258B%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2">1</a> ), but also the official language for all scientific works that claim to be internationally recognized.  This fact should be taken into account when analyzing numbers. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c25/e80/6e1/c25e806e1eb4bd4c79a2f309c023e8a3.jpg">  The presence in the table on the second and third positions of the German and, accordingly, French languages, indicates that despite the insignificant compared to the English distribution, the share of these languages ‚Äã‚Äãaccounts for a significant part of the articles.  This indicates a high intellectual potential of the speakers of this language.  Indirect confirmation of this statement can be found in the fact that the economies of Germany and France serve as a locomotive for the entire European Union.  And products made in the same Germany are a kind of quality standard, and this is true not only in relation to the automotive industry, but also to other high-tech industries. <br>  At the same time, the Russian language, which exceeds the prevalence of German and French together, accounts for <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A1%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BA_%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B5_%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D1%2581%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D1%2591%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D1%2585_%25D1%258F%25D0%25B7%25D1%258B%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2">~ 1.5</a> times fewer articles than French or German separately.  Based on this fact, we can draw the appropriate conclusion about the intellectual potential of the speakers of a given language.  This conclusion is confirmed if we analyze the state of science, economy and industry of countries for which this language is the official one. <br>  Thus, it can be argued that such an indicator as the number of articles published on WikiPedia can serve as a specific criterion for assessing the intellectual maturity of speakers of this language and the development of their science, economy and industry. <br>  Developing the topic, you can transform the first table by adding columns with numbers to it reflecting the dynamics of the increase in the number of articles for each language and see the following dependencies: <br><table><tbody><tr><td>  Language articles </td><td>  2009 </td><td>  2010 </td><td>  Delta-2010 </td><td>  2011 </td><td>  Delta-2011 </td><td>  2012 </td><td>  Delta-2012 </td><td>  2013 </td><td>  Delta 2013 </td></tr><tr><td>  English </td><td>  2847 </td><td>  3290 </td><td>  sixteen% </td><td>  3645 </td><td>  eleven% </td><td>  3907 </td><td>  7% </td><td>  4230 </td><td>  eight% </td></tr><tr><td>  German </td><td>  894 </td><td>  1066 </td><td>  nineteen% </td><td>  1236 </td><td>  sixteen% </td><td>  1383 </td><td>  7% </td><td>  4230 </td><td>  eight% </td></tr><tr><td>  French </td><td>  792 </td><td>  947 </td><td>  20% </td><td>  1106 </td><td>  17% </td><td>  1230 </td><td>  eleven% </td><td>  1380 </td><td>  12% </td></tr><tr><td>  Italian </td><td>  560 </td><td>  687 </td><td>  23% </td><td>  803 </td><td>  17% </td><td>  905 </td><td>  13% </td><td>  1030 </td><td>  14% </td></tr><tr><td>  Spanish </td><td>  465 </td><td>  596 </td><td>  28% </td><td>  761 </td><td>  28% </td><td>  879 </td><td>  sixteen% </td><td>  1010 </td><td>  15% </td></tr><tr><td>  Russians </td><td>  380 </td><td>  534 </td><td>  41% </td><td>  714 </td><td>  34% </td><td>  838 </td><td>  17% </td><td>  1000 </td><td>  nineteen% </td></tr></tbody></table><br><ol><li>  The smaller the absolute number of articles in a given language, the more intense the dynamics of their growth over the years.  Those.  the number of articles is not only dependent on the intelligence of the native speakers, but also on the degree of coverage of the carriers with access to the Network.  It is obvious that in the CIS countries, which are the main speakers of the Russian language, the mass coverage of the network began only the last 5 years, hence the outstanding indicators of the increase in the number of articles. </li><li>  In the long term, the number of articles in the main 4-6 languages ‚Äã‚Äã(minus English) should stabilize around a certain constant value of ¬± 2-3%.  It is obvious that as the number of articles grows in a certain language, the average IQ of the speakers of this language also grows; science, economics, and production are developing. </li></ol><br>  Based on the foregoing, two conclusions can be made.  The first and unconditional - WikiPedia is not only the carrier of a huge stock of information and knowledge in many languages, but also in itself acts as a generator for new / derived knowledge and information.  The second is not unconditional, but extremely fair - carriers of several basic languages ‚Äã‚Äãhave a higher IQ, respectively, the presence in the country of two or more official languages ‚Äã‚Äãcontributes not only to an increase in the indicator of intellectual development, but also to the development of science, economics and / or industry. </div>
