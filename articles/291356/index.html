In my opinion, it turned out to be somewhat underestimated, I have not received a single comment, although the material is quite interesting. <br><br>  In the process of preparing that article, I registered on Simon‚Äôs website and received a brochure, the translation of which I want to submit today.  So, <i><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/hv9y7vkvys1oftm/Speak%2520to%2520Inspire%2520Action%2520V2.pdf%3Fdl%3D0" title="Original">Speak to Inspire Action</a> - tips that will help you speak and point out a path that will inspire others to join your cause.</i> <br><br>  In order for our world to change for the better, great ideas must somehow spread.  In order for the idea to spread, it must be sufficiently understandable.  When ideas are easy to understand, they become more effective.  We wake up every day to inspire people and do things that inspire them.  The tips and ideas presented in this essay are written by Simon Shink and are designed to help the reader speak and present his ideas in such a way as to inspire other people's interest in these very ideas.  Co-creation is much better than working alone. <a name="habracut"></a>

    <h4>  1. Speak to those interested </h4><br>  A clearly formulated goal quickly attracts supporters and repels skeptics.  Immediately, it is necessary to speak with those whose attention has already been attracted, and not to convince or ‚Äúsell‚Äù the idea to the skeptical. <br><br>  When we try to convince others that we are right, we occupy a position in which part of the audience can make oppositional judgments.  The best way to get the necessary dynamics (traction) of your ideas is to focus your time and attention on those who already believe in them and voluntarily expand the number of followers and like-minded people. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e17/289/07b/e1728907beac439cb2df7571c7fed96a.png" alt="bell" align="right">  Simon in his speeches and publications often refers to the law of diffusion of innovations (diffusion of innovations) and, illustrating this law, the bell-shaped schedule (normal distribution).  Innovators and enthusiasts are the categories of users who primarily require involvement and on which, at first, it is necessary to concentrate all their forces.  It is they who seek to be a part of something that seems important to them and that which they believe. <br><br>  Most are skeptical, and not ready to accept new ideas not tried by anyone.  Focus on the left side of the distribution graph.  Yes, we need the majority if we want to change the world, but innovators and enthusiasts inspire it. <br><br>  Instead of trying to speak in front of a large crowd and doubting skeptics, say where you were invited to speak, where people are open to your ideas and want you to share them.  If you bang your head against the wall, you can burn out and your ideas will disappear.  Start with those who believe you, believe that they can stand shoulder to shoulder with you. <br><br><h4>  2. Speak to the audience </h4><br>  When you make a presentation or make a presentation, what are your perspectives?  What is your relationship with your audience?  When we come up with a motive that is different from providing useful information to the audience, the audience will definitely feel it. <br><br>  On the other hand, agreeing to speak only for money, or in the hope of acquiring useful connections that may come in handy in the future, or to impress management in the hope of promotion, you cannot effectively inspire others.  That does not mean at all that the fee, bonds, shares and other incentives do not matter.  Absolutely have.  However, these are just side effects. <br><br><h4>  3. Start with the final goal. </h4><br>  This refers directly to the proposed concept ‚ÄúStart With Why‚Äù.  Before you start on the road, you need to know your destination.  How would you like people to feel when leaving your presentation?  What would you like to achieve by inspiration of your ideas?  What is the main idea?  When you begin with your final goal, you can tailor each story and thought that you‚Äôve told to your target destination.  Sometimes it may be useful to plan a presentation from the opposite.  Instead of the first paragraph, start with the final conclusions, then figure out what needs to be done to arrive at the introductory words, and the main idea should express in brief the whole point of the presentation. <br><br>  When introducing new material, some speakers, including Simon, move around the stage with the very basic idea.  They will tell stories and share experiences related only to this idea and strengthening only it and nothing else.  This ability comes with experience and practice.  At the same time, even if you already have a prepared speech, you can still revise it in the same way. <br><br><h4>  4. Get hold of the hall </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/91c/3c7/baf/91c3c7baf9ff474ba52d09dcf36bcf4a.jpg" alt="Stark1" align="left">  While you are on stage, the whole room belongs only to you.  Being in front of an audience ready to listen to you, when you are ready to convey your idea, the audience feels satisfied, because you have already laid the foundation for inspiring your ideas. <br><br><h5>  Here are some ideas for capturing an audience: </h5><br>  <i>Confidently climb the stage</i> <br><br>  Before you begin your speech, you have a way to the stage and the hall‚Äôs attention will already be focused on your person before you start speaking.  If you seem nervous or worried, extraneous conversations in the audience will begin before the first word breaks from your lips.  A great way to increase the level of comfortable interaction with the audience is to enter the stage.  Even if you are in the very gallery of the large hall, walk forward slowly.  Do not run, do not jump, just walk confidently.  This approach will help to tune in to the maximum level of eloquence and the ability to persuade. <br><br>  <i>Pause before you talk.</i> <br><br>  Most of the speakers begin to speak as soon as they come up to the stage, this, of course, is not true.  One of the best ways to attract attention is a pause before the start of the report.  Make eye contact with several people in the audience.  At first you may feel a little uncomfortable, but this is a very effective way of communicating with people.  Eye contact can provide a much more powerful start than originally planned. <br><br>  <i>Don't stand still</i> <br><br>  The way you move on stage will enhance the oral impact.  Great speakers always move on the stage completely naturally.  Their gestures are fluid and fluid.  Simon Sink especially for this took lessons in a ballet class.  Ballet gives an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe correct movement, while there is absolutely no need to learn pirouettes and other dance movements.  Just learn the basics of movement. <br><br><h4>  5. Talk only about what you know and what you care about. </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/64f/aeb/9e5/64faeb9e58b64b38ab9cd706880762cd.jpg" alt="Stark2"><br><br>  Have you ever noticed how passionately parents talk about their children?  This indicates only parental care, and not their oratorical talent.  When you talk about what you love and what you are passionate about, the audience feels it.  Speaking more naturally, with more passion and energy, you can more effectively influence your audience. <br><br>  Stick only to those understandable to you.  We cannot be experts in everything, and too often we try to appear as such.  In fact, admitting facts that are unknown to you helps people to trust more when you talk about what you really know. <br><br>  When you try to appear to be an expert in what you don‚Äôt understand, everything said can be perceived as unreliable, with the result that the whole performance will suffer. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/291356/">https://habr.com/ru/post/291356/</a></p>
