  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Responsibility against the programmer</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><h4>  Introduction </h4><br>  Working as a programmer in one small enterprise connected with a government order, one has to face many problems inherent in such organizations.  This is incompetence, and irresponsibility, and unwillingness to develop, and a simple lack of interest in the work performed.  At some point, everyone decides for himself to change jobs, and here an ordinary programmer often has ‚Äúanchors‚Äù that keep him at work.  First of all, this is responsibility to colleagues for unfinished projects.  Why is it usually possible to hear from familiar programmers: ‚ÄúI‚Äôll finish the project and leave‚Äù? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Problem </h4><br>  The work of the programmer is associated with constant mental activity.  The duration of this activity to solve the task cannot be absolutely accurately measured (Mythical Man-Month, F. Brooks, 1975).  Therefore, in complex and lengthy projects there are errors, failures of dates.  Many projects stop before they start. <br><br>  In this light, the programmer looks like a person poorly motivated, irresponsible.  At the same time, he completely lacks a conscience!  But in life, everything usually leaves, everything except the programmers.  Programmers want to finish the project, correctly transfer the source code, add documentation ... Of course, not all programmers are like that, but they seem to be the majority.

    <h4>  Effects </h4><br>  And now, when people change, deadlines fail, tension floats in the air, does not pay salaries, invites you to a better paying job - good programmers work to a certain point.  And this point can be far away, and employers in the person of bosses begin to use it.  And no matter how hard the programmer tries, he doesn‚Äôt get any better.  The programmer is working gritting his teeth and repeating the word "Must", "Must finish the project." <br><br>  You can take, for example, a book.  If you start reading a book, then it is better to finish it, otherwise there will be some kind of spiritual pit.  All my life, at the mention of this book, thoughts will come: ‚ÄúBut he began to read, why didn‚Äôt he?‚Äù.  So programmers seem to be people who are trying to keep the number of these holes to a minimum. <br><br><h4>  Decision </h4><br>  Due to the lack of open publications with research on this issue, the decision is chosen by everyone for himself.  Someone puts the installation for himself: ‚ÄúAnother month without a salary and that's it!‚Äù, Someone: ‚ÄúAfter two months the project is archived and free!‚Äù.  But still this is everyone‚Äôs decision.  The main thing is to accurately determine this point and not to retreat from the plan, otherwise others will start using your weakness. <br><br><h4>  findings </h4><br>  Programmers are ordinary people.  But they have a heightened sense of responsibility, because they create works of programmer art, always different and unusually complex.  They love their programs and strive to bring them to, if not perfection, then working condition.  Programmers should monitor their responsibility and, of course, always try to complete their projects! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/97490/">https://habr.com/ru/post/97490/</a></p>
