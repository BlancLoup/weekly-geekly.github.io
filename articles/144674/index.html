Ahead of the vacation time, and I would like to share with you a complete overview of the roaming proposals of our ‚Äúfavorite‚Äù telecom operators.  I hope you can save more than one thousand rubles, even if you download TV shows. <br>  If you often travel around Russia and the world, then somehow you are already used to the rates of 10 rubles per minute within the country and 30-60 rubles outside of it.  The cost of traffic sometimes has passed for 750 rubles per megabyte (despite the fact that many services in modern smartphones love to download updates).  This state of affairs has ceased to suit the leadership of our country, so that, having shook a finger, it ‚Äúsuggested‚Äù to slightly curb the appetites and to reduce prices at least several times.  A Russian person, of course, has become accustomed to living in conditions of struggle and enjoys all the benefits of wi-fi and skype, tourist SIM cards and IP telephony, but I dare to assure you that from this year you can talk quite profitably without resorting to such tricks. <br><br>  <i>Rates are as of June 1, 2012.</i> <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      Since I myself am from Krasnodar, at first I did a review of roaming in the southern region with a local sim card.  Who is not interested, you can immediately go to travel in <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/144674/">Russia</a> and the <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/144674/">world</a> . <br><br><h4>  Native South Region </h4><br>  The southern region, according to the operators, is the Krasnodar Territory and the Republic of Adygea, the Rostov Region, the Stavropol Territory, the Volgograd Region, the Astrakhan Region, the Republic of Kalmykia, the Republic of North Ossetia-Alania, the Republic of Ingushetia, the Karachay-Cherkess Republic, the Kabardino-Balkarian Republic and the Republic of Dagestan. <br><br>  Table 1 - rates of operators in roaming in the South Federal District <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/492/adf/2c4/492adf2c4866ed2cf4c0e7919413e20e.png" alt="image" width="803" height="325"><br><br>  A minute of outgoing and incoming calls cost 9-10 rubles, SMS - almost 4, the Internet at a fixed price.  <b>MTS</b> turned off its service <b>‚ÄúNeighboring regions‚Äù,</b> drastically reducing communication costs and left only <b>‚ÄúAlways at home‚Äù</b> , which really has slightly better conditions when staying in the Southern Federal District: outgoing for the Southern Federal District for 1.5 rubles, and not for 3, all incoming calls are free. subscription to 3 rubles per day (connection - 30 rubles to the number * 111 * 3333 #) <br>  As in the past year, when traveling to another region of the Southern Federal District, it is highly desirable to connect the profitable <b>‚ÄúHome Region‚Äù service to Beeline</b> .  When you connect the service for 30 rubles and a monthly fee of just 1 ruble per day, you can practically not limit yourself in communication: all incoming calls, calls and SMS are absolutely identical to the home rate.  You can connect it to the number * 110 * 241 #, disconnect - * 110 * 240 #.  I was pleased with <b>Megafon</b> only by offering the option <b>‚ÄúRegion-Caucasus‚Äù</b> , which similarly makes the cost of calls and SMS ‚Äúlike at home‚Äù.  You can connect it to the number * 235 * 13 * 2 # for 30 rubles, the monthly fee is only 50 kopecks per day, and <b>Tele2</b> traditionally offers competitive prices only in ‚Äúits own‚Äù region - the Rostov region - and standard prices in all others. <br><br><a name="russia"></a><h4>  Russian roads </h4><br>  Prices for intranet roaming are shown in Table 2, but there are some points to pay attention to. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/944/3e7/83a/9443e783a7c705edfe5fdbfdc789e0fb.png" alt="image"><br><br>  At <b>MTS,</b> be sure to enable the service <b>‚ÄúEverywhere at home‚Äù</b> .  The connection costs 30 rubles and the subscription fee is 3.95 per day, but you will not pay for incoming calls, and calls to any numbers will cost 3 rubles.  Connect / Disconnect - * 111 * 2150 # <br>  On <b>Beeline,</b> be sure to connect <b>‚ÄúRoaming Light‚Äù</b> with the command * 110 * 9991 #.  With its help, all incoming calls in roaming will be free, outgoing calls to Beeline all over Russia are 1.95, to other phones - 4.95 per minute.  Connecting it for free, and the monthly fee - 5 rubles per day.  You can absolutely not limit yourself to receive calls from colleagues, partners and relatives, and for home calls, you can use the USSD command ‚ÄúCall Me‚Äù - * 144 * phone number #, for example * 144 * 9031234567 #.  Then this subscriber will receive an SMS-message with a request to call and call you back at your cheap regular rate. <br>  <b>Megaphone</b>  For 3 rubles a day, you can use the <b>‚ÄúMega Country‚Äù service</b> , which makes all calls at a cost of 2.90 at once.  You can connect it for 30 rubles by the number * 235 * 4 * 2 #, disconnect - * 235 * 4 * 3 #.  For 4.90 per day, you can receive all incoming calls for free with the service <b>‚ÄúEasy reception‚Äù</b> , but the connection costs 49 rubles (* 235 * 3 * 2 #, disconnection * 235 * 3 * 3 #).  Again, you can use the service ‚Äúcall me back‚Äù by getting a free connection with relatives (* 144 * subscriber number #). <br>  <b>Tele2</b> rates are highly dependent on the region to which you intend to arrive, so we recommend that you look at the network coverage map before the trip.  If an operator works in the region you need, then incoming and outgoing to Tele2 will cost 1.5 rubles, the other outgoing / incoming - 5 rubles.  Internet at home rate, and SMS - 0.95.  If, for example, you are in Moscow, you will receive 9.45 rubles for outgoing and incoming and 4.5 rubles SMS.  Internet - 25 rubles per megabyte. <br><br><a name="world"></a><h4>  Abroad </h4><br>  For the sake of this section, and cost to analyze the proposals.  Since last year, the prices have "lost weight" several times, on the Internet - 20-50 and sometimes 100 times!  So be sure to read the operator's site before the trip, it may pleasantly surprise you. <br>  So, billing is divided into zones.  Usually Zone 1 - CIS and Europe, Zone 2 - Africa, Asia, Australia, Zone 3 - North and South America.  But make sure that this division applies to your operator.  Sometimes you wonder how strongly the division into zones by different providers ‚Äújumps‚Äù and it seems that the site is made specifically to completely confuse you. <br>  So let's go. <br><br>  Table 3 - fees for international roaming <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/609/9ff/5e9/6099ff5e9264923269fac2ea1c18e2af.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The table, of course, is extremely confusing.  It is extremely unprofitable for operators to save money.  We understand in pieces. <br><br><h5>  Tele 2 </h5><br>  Everything is very simple and profitable.  For the year, tariffs in Europe fell by 2 times, with no monthly fees. <br>  Europe - incoming and outgoing 9.45 rubles per minute, SMS - 4.50 rubles. <br>  Africa, Asia, Australia - 35 and 12 respectively. <br>  North and South America - 65 and 12 respectively. <br>  In Tele2 networks in Sweden, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Croatia and Kazakhstan you can get even more advantageous tariffs when you activate the service <b>‚ÄúPreferential roaming‚Äù</b> - * 143 * 1 #: 5 rubles a minute of outgoing and incoming calls, 3.50 - SMS, 5 rubles - megabyte. <br>  It is cheap.  But!  Before you travel, make sure that the PIN code request feature is enabled on your phone.  If your phone does not request a PIN when you turn it on, you need to enable this feature.  To register on the network in the PIN code input field, you need to dial the number "1" and then the PIN.  That is, if PIN 9876, then you need to dial 19876 in the input field. Otherwise, you will not register on another network! <br>  Remember also that although you can receive incoming messages in the same way as usual, you will not be able to call directly!  It is necessary to use the command * 147 * 8xxxxxxxxx # or * 147 * + 7xxxxxxxxxx #.  That is, to dial the number 8-952-123-45-67, you need to enter * 147 * 89521234567 # and press the send call button.  International roaming is activated automatically, billing in real time.  In some European countries, you can call without these problems, check the operator's site before the trip. <br><br><h5>  Mts </h5><br>  Practically without changing the base rates, it offers a good service <b>‚ÄúWorld without Borders‚Äù.</b>  When you connect it when you are in Armenia, Belarus, Ukraine or Uzbekistan, your calls will be charged as follows: 10 minutes of incoming calls are free, from 11 minutes - 5.90 rubles per minute.  1 minute of outgoing calls to Russia - 25 rubles, from 2 minutes - 5.90.  If you travel in other countries, the tariffs will be the following: the first 10 minutes are free, from the 11th minute - 8.90 rubles per minute.  1 minute of outgoing calls to Russia - according to the tariff, from 2 minutes - 8.90.  The fee is 19 rubles per day.  You can connect to the number * 111 * 33 * 7 #. <br>  You can also connect the free service <b>‚ÄúGo-go roaming‚Äù</b> to the number * 111 * 882 #, with it incoming and outgoing calls will cost you only 11.90 (in ‚Äúdistant‚Äù countries - 79 rubles), though you need to call the numbers with the prefix such as * 137 * 79181234567 #.  True Internet and in fact, and in another case, it will still cost 750 rubles per megabyte.  Reducing the cost of services such as "BIT abroad" will allow you to pamper yourself with the Internet, because with it 10 megabytes per day you will be available for 300 rubles per day in Europe and 700 rubles per day in other countries.  But of course it is better to find free wi-fi access points or buy a local SIM card. <br>  In order for you to be available in roaming, you need to go to the service office and activate the International Access and International and National Roaming services.  According to users, billing can be both real-time and offline, so the balance of your phone may not be accurate. <br><br><h5>  Beeline </h5><br>  Beeline will be very happy tourists this year for its service <b>"Multipass".</b>  Judge for yourself: in Europe, the CIS and Asian countries, the outgoing call is 15, and the incoming one is only 5 rubles, SMS is 3.95, and the Internet is 25 times cheaper than 30 rubles per megabyte. <br>  In other countries, you can use less comfortable services, for example, ‚ÄúCountry to order‚Äù - a discount on all calls and SMS at 50% of the basic price of the tariff.  Subscription fee - 15 rubles per day.  * 139 * 551 * country_code # <br>  <b>‚ÄúVoiced roaming‚Äù</b> - 50% discount on all incoming calls.  Fee - 10 rubles per day.  * 110 * 0051 # <br>  <b>‚ÄúComfortable Roaming‚Äù</b> is an extremely advantageous offer for subscribers who take a lot of calls.  100 incoming minutes in any country of the world for 895 rubles.  * 110 * 995 #. <br>  But the most profitable is the new <b>‚ÄúSeductive roaming‚Äù</b> (connect by the number * 110 * 0171 #).  For 10 rubles a day incoming and SMS in any country of the world will cost you only 3.95 rubles! <br>  Services can be combined with each other.  International roaming is activated automatically.  Tariffication - in real time. <br><br><h5>  Megaphone </h5><br>  In order to use roaming, it is necessary to activate the service ‚ÄúRoaming in all networks‚Äù in the office, otherwise the phone abroad will not work. <br>  The main innovation is <b>‚ÄúEuro tariff‚Äù</b> , which is automatically connected.  Calls, SMS, Internet in Europe are much cheaper and without any additional services.  Outgoing calls will cost 16 rubles, and incoming and SMS - 6, the Internet - 50 rubles per megabyte.  In other countries, you can activate the service <b>"My World"</b> - included 2 times cheaper for 10 rubles per day - * 235 * 6 * 2 #, off * 235 * 6 * 3 #. <br>  The present is a present for owners of smartphones from Megaphone - the Internet almost throughout Europe ( <a href="http://mobile-review.com/articles/2012/image/mega-new-packs/spisok2105.pdf">List</a> ) for <b>7 (!) Rubles</b> (107 times cheaper than other operators), with the <b>‚ÄúHoliday-online‚Äù service,</b> which can be connected in just 10 rubles by number * 104 # and further by selecting this option. <br>  In some regions, the option "Around the World."  Connection is 15 rubles (* 105 * 708 #), the subscription fee is 9. It makes SMS, incoming and outgoing calls in the CIS, Europe and some other countries at the price of 6-9 rubles. <br><br><h4>  findings </h4><br>  If you are from the Krasnodar Territory and are traveling in the <b>South Federal District and the North-</b> West <b>Federal District</b> , the best choice is ‚ÄúHome Region‚Äù on Beeline, ‚ÄúRegion-Caucasus‚Äù on Megaphone and ‚ÄúEverywhere at Home‚Äù of MTS.  Connect required. <br>  If you are traveling in <b>Russia</b> , be sure to connect ‚ÄúRoaming Light‚Äù from Beeline, in the second place ‚ÄúEverywhere at Home‚Äù from MTS, or bring a Tele2 SIM card with you if you are going to the region where it is presented.  If you have a Megaphone, connect the "Mega Country" for outgoing calls or "Easy reception", if most of it will be incoming. <br>  If you are going <b>abroad, the</b> best offer will be roaming from Tele2 for you.  If you use another operator, analyze which country or countries you are going to go to and how many minutes to spend, since current offers of operators help save a lot.  Megafonovsky Euro Tariff, Beeline Multi-Pass and MTS World without Borders are just a must have for any traveler to stay in touch and not spend thousands of rubles on it.  If you fly far away, connect Beeline's ‚ÄúSeductive Roaming‚Äù or ‚Äúgo-go roaming‚Äù from MTS and you can also not be afraid for the budget. <br><br>  2012 really gave us the tariffs that Russians deserve abroad.  It is not entirely clear why they could not have been accepted before, but already now it is possible to save a lot if you connect the necessary services in advance.  Have a nice connection on vacation! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/144674/">https://habr.com/ru/post/144674/</a></p>
