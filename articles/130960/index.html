This applies to both copywriting and web-rated.  How to create your own brand, a valuable brand?  First of all, you need to learn how to position yourself.  And there is an effective way of this positioning, namely, niche.  Of course, there are other branding tools, but this can be attributed to the main, fundamental ones. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  So, everything in order.  What is niche and what does it eat?  Nesting is a specialization, an expert area.  You can work with any text, this is the choice of the majority.  There is no question of specialization.  You can choose advertising texts as the main direction.  And someone at all is limited only to such an area as commercial offers.  This is a niche. <br><br>  Very often we hear that a good author will cope with any tasks.  At the same time, my opinion remains adamant - working on the principle of ‚Äúeverything for all‚Äù is a wrong and inefficient choice.

      Nesting is one of the most effective branding tools (and perhaps the most effective).  Of course, in order for this tool to work, you must occupy a worthy place in the chosen niche.  You must be an expert in this niche.  It should be noted that specialization in any content-direction is not a sufficient condition.  You also need to sell this specialization to potential customers. <br><br>  In order to form a brand, it is important to have a profitable difference that is easier to show and prove to customers.  And, most importantly, to interest in this difference - to SELL it.  If you take the practice, here niche is in its infancy, say more - this tool does not work.  In the market of web-raiting, there is not only a niche, we hardly even see any attempts to differ, but to compare favorably. <br><br>  ‚ÄúWrite about everything‚Äù - about 90% of web writers adhere to this aspiration.  This is especially true for beginners.  Newbies happily grab everything.  In principle, it is logical - you need to start getting at least some income.  It may well be that after dialing a certain rating and a pool of customers, the author will reassess values. <br><br>  However, the fact is that niche is not used by more experienced authors.  Even experienced authors, despite the rather large experience in the web-raiting market, continue to clutch at each ‚Äúpiece‚Äù.  Financial topics?  Ready!  Jurisprudence?  You are welcome.  Patterns to generate?  I'm sick, but I'll take it anyway.  And maybe posts on the livestock forum?  For the first time I meet, but still try. <br><br>  To work on the principle of ‚Äúeverything for everyone‚Äù, without choosing a specific niche, is a path that is not distinguished by its effectiveness.  Choosing this approach, it is very difficult to come up with high, really high, pay rates.  Not to mention personal branding.  How can you create a valuable personal brand if you are no different from most authors and ‚Äúeat‚Äù any subject?  Why Nestle is not engaged in the production of cars, and Toyota does not specialize in chocolate products?  Because they chose their direction, their niche.  It was this particular specialization that helped these companies form a brand that is highly valued in the market.  And today Nestle is delicious chocolate, and Toyota is high-quality cars. <br><br>  What can a web writer encounter if it works with any ‚Äúpiece‚Äù turned up?  He can simply screw it up in unfamiliar topics.  Moreover, qualified customers can publicly ridicule the author who is "not in the subject."  The result is a soaked reputation, and reputation is one of the most important values ‚Äã‚Äãfor a web writer. <br><br>  Where do the ‚Äúfeet‚Äù of niche grow from and why is a master not worth his weight in gold? <br><br>  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãniche was formulated by Jack Trout.  This idea consists in the following: the consumer is inclined to trust the profile specialists, rather than ‚Äúall-rounder masters‚Äù.  In practice, this means that the majority of consumers prefer working with narrow specialists, ‚Äúexperts‚Äù.  Note that not only people, but also specialized products / services / companies act as ‚Äúexperts‚Äù. <br><br>  For example, if I decided to eat pizza, heading to a pizzeria, and not choose a regular cafe.  For the layout of the flash site I resort to the services of a flasher, and not a wide-profile programmer.  Of course, there are some reservations here, but in general it works.  Because we are dealing with human psychology.  And this psychology does not perceive specialists "in everything."  Agree, it is very difficult to believe that the installer plays the violin perfectly, sews and effectively sells in the Forex market?  At the same time, most web authors remind of just such a universal installer - I‚Äôll write SEO texts, provide high-quality posting, multiply, otreraych, and work on an analytical review and sell it. <br><br>  I do not know about you, but my mind is resisting - IMPOSSIBLE!  Being an expert in everything is Utopia.  Of course, if the customer needs low-quality texts, you can ‚Äúmold‚Äù him the content ‚Äúeverything about everything‚Äù.  Yes you can.  BUT - here we are not talking about expert, honest texts. <br><br>  And if the customer needs texts that solve important business problems?  If his need is for an effective booklet, press release, one-page, commercial offer or advertising concept - he, with a high degree of probability, will choose a narrow specialist.  Not always, but most likely. <br><br>  In summary, the advantages of niche are as follows: <br><br>  1) Customer confidence in niche specialists is higher.  Serious articles of a narrow thematic focus, most likely, will entrust the web-site that specializes in this and which has profitably SOLD this specialization to the market. <br><br>  2) The services of niche specialists are easier to remember.  For example, it is much easier to remember and identify an author with a unique ‚Äúniche‚Äù advertisement than an author, whose advertisement is similar to the advertisement of a huge number of web writers.  ‚ÄúI work with any subjects.  Fast, high quality, cheap ‚Äù- trite, is not it?  ‚ÄúMy texts are taught to manage finances‚Äù - but here is niche in action. <br><br>  3) Often narrow specialists get more.  Expert status is a tool to increase value.  Of course, this status must be supported by work and recommendations. <br><br>  4) Niche - this theme that you know best.  Accordingly, working with this niche, you will be like a fish in water. <br><br>  5) As a rule, the ‚Äúniche‚Äù theme is a favorite theme, and writing in a favorite genre is a real high.  Moreover, you get money for it, good money. <br><habracut></habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/130960/">https://habr.com/ru/post/130960/</a></p>
