  <section class="page js-page"><h1>[Advertising] UPS based on kinetic energy storage</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The use of uninterruptible power supplies seems commonplace for personal computers.  They have even greater validity in data centers.  Moreover, it is spelled out in the holy of holies - in the rules for creating and operating data centers.  Including  and memorable TIER.  And for quite a long time, for powerful server-based systems, instead of UPSs with chemical batteries, another type of drives is used - kinetic, in which rotating flywheels serve as energy storage. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/10d/5c3/e7a/10d5c3e7a88363243c6bb49d57b88e60.jpg" alt="image"><br>  What is uninterruptible power supply?  In order that at the moment when the mains voltage is gone, or there is a deep collapse of it, quickly pick up the power supply of the servers and the cooling infrastructure of the data center and provide power to the output of the backup diesel generator to its operating mode.  Typically, such systems are designed for power in the hundreds of kilowatts and to maintain power supply from a few seconds to a few minutes.  Further, after working out its IPT, the diesel generator set will already power the consuming equipment.  But in those seconds and minutes before the diesel shaft spins up, the most terrible risk for the data center lies.  Therefore, so much attention is paid to uninterruptible power supplies when creating them. <br>  In comparison with battery solutions, handwheel UPSs have several significant advantages.  They do not require a special room with a microclimate rigidly maintained there.  With equal power and energy consumption, flywheel UPSs take up 40-50 percent less space.  Operating costs are significantly lower.  There is no risk of electrolyte spills.  Higher reliability of the unit and an incomparably longer working life - 20 years or more. <br>  There are few companies in the global market that provide such solutions.  Among the most well-known and best-selling brands are European Hitec, Hitzinger, Piller, the American company ActivePower and.  perhaps that's all.  The rest, which can be ‚Äúcaught‚Äù on the Internet, are either at the research and development stage, or at the stage of perpetual market entry or bankruptcy.  The latter are those that have chosen a very risky way of using high-speed super-flywheels.  The most famous of these companies is the American BeaconPower, which went under the hammer despite government infusions in the amount of $ 34 million. <a name="habracut"></a><br>  However, European companies are living well and gradually, on the sly, in the wake of the boom in the construction of data centers, are being drawn into the Russian market.  For example, UPSs with kinetic drives are used in the data center of Krok company, in the well-known large project Beeline in Yaroslavl and in many other projects. <br>  However, over the past two years, domestic technologies that use kinetic energy storage devices in their solutions have already grown in Russia.  This is a project of the Russian Superconductor company, which is developing kinetic drives of high power and energy intensity.  By the way, the well-known scientific professor Nurbey Gulia, who is an unsurpassed authority in the field of flywheel mechanics and the author of hundreds of patents in this field, acted as the research manager. <br>  Specialists from the "Russian Superconductor" not so long ago announced the successful testing of the kinetic energy storage device, the energy intensity of which is 4 MJ.  They used a 22 kW generator for this model.  Representatives of the company say that they have developed a modular design, which allows to multiply increase the energy intensity of their drive up to 30 times.  In addition, the power used motor generator can also vary widely - from 5 to 500 kW. <br>  As noted in the company, the volume of the market of powerful UPSs in Russia is very large and is currently being satisfied only with chemical batteries and in a small amount so far with foreign flywheel units.  Among the advantages of their equipment they note: high specific energy intensity, high specific power, significantly lower prices, high performance.  The service life of UPS NKE more than 20 years.  The company plans to complete the testing of the serial sample of the product and enter the UPS market in 2014. </div>
