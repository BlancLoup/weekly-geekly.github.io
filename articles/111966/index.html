  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Atomic tablet Odeon TPC-10, part one</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  There will be two, maybe three parts.  The first (current) - introduction, about how I came to such a life, in the second I will describe the impressions of the device.  In the third plan some specific software solutions to describe, if such appear. <br><br>  In this part there will be a lot of pamphlets and few pictures.  :) <br><br>  I wanted the tablet for a long time, but I still can‚Äôt choose.  In principle, there are not so many options - an apple ipad, something android, a transforming netbook or a tablet on an x86-compatible processor (the same netbook, only with a torn keyboard). <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/32f/94f/79a/32f94f79ae7e0f1e04b94df859727cdd.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I needed a tablet, first of all, for comfortable reading of djvu.  Secondly - pdf, cbr and cbz.  Well, in the third - for browsing from the couch.  With the second and third points, in principle, any tablet handles it without any problems, so the first one became decisive.  Only devices of approximately 10 "diagonals were considered, although occasionally I glanced at 7" - but I still did not understand why these overgrown communicators are needed.

Both options did not suit me.  Recoding is a great investment of time and a rather strong swelling of files, iphone software is a terrible image quality. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2b7/ceb/a15/2b7ceba1521735ea69ef9dc6da391d6e.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <b>Android tablets</b> are quite voluminous.  To begin with, all inexpensive Chinese devices disappeared.  Very uneven build quality, resistive screen, old versions of android ... More decent models (modern android, capacitive screen) have already disappeared for another reason - there is only one program (vudroid) for reading djvu, and it differs in increased falling tide, not very dependent. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3dc/294/f40/3dc294f403530d19d50aa8dddf98ef6f.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <b>Netbook-transformers</b> - the option would be very tempting.  But after I threw out netbooks on an atom from consideration (for the transformer was supposed to be my main laptop), the choice was reduced to acer 1425 or 1825. Both netbooks are very good, in my opinion (I have acer 1410), but the main disadvantage is the weight of 1.8 kg.  The usual, non-transformer, netbook version weighs one and a half kilograms and I personally consider this to be the maximum weight for my laptop. <br><br>  Therefore, in the end, I stopped on tablets with x86-compatible processors - there are no problems with the software to view the files I need, quite decent weight, normal screen size ... Since the tablet didn‚Äôt consider the role of the main laptop, processor weakness and lack of hardware acceleration of video playback forgive <br><br>  I thought to order from the Chinese, but there such tablets cost around 500 bucks.  The difference from the Russian price is not global, but all sorts of drawbacks are added such as lack of warranty, delivery by mail, etc.  Therefore, I decided to look at what our stores offer. <br><br>  And they offer the Viewsonic Viewpad 10, Odeon TPC-10 and iRos PD10, which, strictly speaking, are the same device, slightly different characteristics (and place of sale).  I did not find the last one on sale, but I met the first two. <br><br>  <b>Viewpad 10 is</b> currently Svyaznoy exclusive, inside it has an 1.6Ghz atom, a 16 gigabyte SSD and two operating systems ‚Äî Windows 7 HP and Android 1.6.  Complete set, unfortunately, I do not know (they write that almost naked). <br><br>  <b>Odeon TPC-10</b> - you can say, MTSovsky exclusive (for now?), The viewpad differs from the processor - 1.8Ghz, the large SSD - 32Gb and the lack of android.  Included are a tablet, an adapter from miniDSUB to DSUB, a carrying case (just a bag). <br><br>  There is neither a GSM module nor there, although there is a place for a SIM card. <br><br>  Considering that both cost the same, but the second one has the best features and equipment, I chose the Odeon TPC-10. <br><br>  Impressions, pictures, etc.  read in <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/gadgets/112028/">continuation</a> .  <s>Which is not yet.</s>  <s>:)</s> Which is already there. <br>  If you have any questions, suggestions for tests or any poses in which you want to see the tablet in the pictures - write. <br><br>  Ps.  Yes, to the claims that I supposedly didn‚Äôt use &lt;insert_device_device&gt;, but scold me.  The ipad, and various eastern tablets (starting with Stobak Chinese and ending with the galaxy tab), and the same transformers were not the same in the selection process ... So the choice was meaningful, from my own experience, and not just from pictures on the Internet.  :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/111966/">https://habr.com/ru/post/111966/</a></p>
