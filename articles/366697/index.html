Optical heart rate monitor options</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1f5/8b2/9de/1f58b29de2be631159da4564f813715c.png"><br><br>  Measuring the pulse is a good and necessary thing: this parameter helps to determine the general condition of the human body, as well as to assess the level of activity of the activity, in the case of training.  True, measuring the pulse ‚Äúon the go‚Äù is a rather troublesome business.  After all, no one wants to carry around bulky devices or carry out measurements manually.  Professional athletes for a long time treated chest pulse meters, whose readings are very accurate.  But the chest heart rate monitor is also not perfect - like, for example, using it to quickly measure the pulse of a person in an office?  In general, over the past few years alternative pulse meters have appeared - optical ones. <br><br>  The optical heart rate monitor shines through the skin of a person using a relatively powerful beam of light, and the optical sensor determines the speed and characteristics of the reflected light radiation, determining the parameters of blood circulation through the capillaries.  Sensors of this type are quite accurate.  The advantage of an optical heart rate monitor is portability, such modules are built into smart watches, fitness trackers and other devices.  We propose to evaluate the most successful models now.

    <a name="habracut"></a>  The market for heart rate monitors <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/fitness/kak-vybrat-pulsometr.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeek%26utm_medium%3Dpodborka%26utm_content%3Dim%26utm_campaign%3Dpulsometr">is huge</a> , but there has always been an increased focus on attention and increased demands on the optical, and the leaders of this niche seem to be able to meet the best expectations.  Let's start with the classics. <br><br><h3>  Mio alpha 2 </h3><br>  One of the most successful models of sports watches of recent times.  Actually, the "sports watch" is not even the right name, rather, it is a heart rate monitor. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/g5eUtua0dvE%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgCatW6_Cch2oWdxJ5hGd4aYcvBhQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  As mentioned above, the device is able to measure the pulse without a loading belt, due to the pulse meter module built into the case.  By determining the pulse, the watch provides an opportunity to adjust the so-called heart rate zones to optimize training. <br><br>  The device transmits all data wirelessly to a mobile phone in its own application.  The <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/mio-alpha-2.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeek%26utm_medium%3Dpodborka%26utm_content%3Dim%26utm_campaign%3Dpulsometr">Mio Alpha 2</a> readings are very accurate, and the pulse is determined even during over-active training (some models of wrist heart rate monitors start to fail at this time). <br><br><h3>  Basis peak </h3><br>  Practically universal device, with equal ease tracking pulse and evaluating the quality of sleep.  Aluminum waterproof case, high-quality display, a large number of functions - what else does an active lifestyle person need? <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/sSjDcSzbk5A%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjft4tDhVPTWC5a1VqVWK-ZTB_DRg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Probably a heart rate monitor, yes.  Here it is, optical, like all other gadgets from the collection.  The device is very accurate, correctly shows the pulse and during exercise and during rest.  With the help of Body IQ technology, the Peak device automatically recognizes different types of activity - running, walking, cycling. <br><br>  The watch uses an advanced optical heart rate monitor with more powerful sensors than most analogs, to improve the accuracy and consistency of heart rate measurement.  The user of <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/basis-peak.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeek%26utm_medium%3Dpodborka%26utm_content%3Dim%26utm_campaign%3Dpulsometr">Basis Peak</a> can monitor the heart rate in real time 24 hours a day, directly on the wrist - while walking, jogging, cycling and with any other type of activity. <br><br><h3>  Microsoft Band </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a84/437/5c2/a844375c25126331fb14ab8fafe0b79a.jpg"><br><br>  This is one of the most functional devices in the collection.  Everything is there - a display, a bunch of modules, sensors and sensors.  Of course, there is an optical heart rate monitor, which has already earned the approval of users of the device.  Thanks to this functionality, Microsoft Band can be called a universal wearable gadget.  The device can be used to organize personal time, business planning, and to assess their activity during sports activities. <br><br>  Since the gadget has an optical heart rate monitor, the pulse itself can be determined at any time - during exercise or during rest.  In addition, the Band has a pedometer, sleep quality sensor, UV radiation detector, GPS, WiFi, Blueooth modules and much more. <br><br><h3>  Fitbit charge </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a03/99c/e8b/a0399ce8b56349064663f8afdda7b2e6.jpg"><br><br>  The pulsometer of the Fitbit Charge HR fitness bracelet works on the basis of its own design, the PurePulse optical heart rate counting technology, which records the slightest changes in blood pressure.  The technique involves the use of tiny safe LEDs on the back of the gadget.  The essence of the method used is that in the heartbeat process, the capillaries expand and contract depending on the volume of blood that fills them.  PurePulse LED technology allows you to determine the microvascular filling by changing the density of the light beam passing through the capillaries.  The photodetector registers the change between the starting indicators from the light source and the reflected result after the absorption of a part of the light beam by blood and soft tissues.  PurePulse technology is completely safe and has extremely low energy consumption. <br><br>  The PurePulse option allows the user to track workout intensity, calories burned by visualizing results using interactive graphs and charts in the Fitbit app. <br><br><h3>  Apple Watch </h3><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/1Ql0Z8Il73s%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhi8qiLPqgXDeU_IieKTNxpnKL6v6g" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  It makes no sense to describe Apple‚Äôs smart watches again - the web is full of reviews.  However, this device also has a heart rate monitor, and it works well.  True, not so long ago, after receiving the update, the heart rate monitor began to work somewhat unpredictably, measuring the pulse not every 10 minutes, but choosing different time intervals. <br><br>  However, Apple seems to have been able to solve the problem, in any case, the number of complaints on the forums has decreased dramatically. <br><br>  Now, optical heart rate monitors and gadgets with them are becoming more common, and the reason for this is the ability to measure heart rate on the go.  Modules of this type are built into many devices, including smart watches.  In principle, this is not a bad idea, since, since a smart watch is called a digital assistant, why don‚Äôt they be a little more and a digital doctor (well, or at least a nurse?).  Indeed, most Android Wear devices are equipped with heart rate monitors, among other models you can call the <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/lg-watch-urbane.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeek%26utm_medium%3Dpodborka%26utm_content%3Dim%26utm_campaign%3Dpulsometr">LG Watch Urban</a> . <br><br>  In the future, probably the number of devices with different modules, the purpose of which is to study the state of the human body, will only increase.  And this is good, because software platforms for tracking the dynamics of the state of your body are also developing.  Google, Apple, Samsung in this matter - ahead of the rest. <br><br>  Well, it remains only to wish everyone good health. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/366697/">https://habr.com/ru/post/366697/</a></p>
