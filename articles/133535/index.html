  <section class="page js-page"><h1>327 000 rubles from the state? You are welcome!</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Discussion of government programs to support start-up entrepreneurs have often been raised on the pages of our collective blog.  But, since there are several self-employment subsidy programs, I still want to stay at one of them, which, for some reason, has hardly received any attention here. <br><br>  At present, the state self-employment subsidy program provides an opportunity for a citizen registered with the employment center as an unemployed to organize his / her own business and receive the largest one-time subsidy (up to 30 minimum wages). <br><br>  You may be interested to know exactly how an ordinary person from a simple Russian city can take it and get a grant for the development of his business in the amount of 327,000 rubles. <br>  How much time and effort was spent, what obstacles stood in the way of achieving the goal - everything will be briefly discussed under the cut. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In each region, as you well know, the minimum wage is different.  Six months ago, the minimum wage in Moscow amounted to 10,900 rubles.  30 MROT - 327,000 rubles.

      So, what you need to get subsidies: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Resign, at least ‚Äúon paper‚Äù, to register as an unemployed person.  In practice, this means that a) in the workbook there should be a mark about your dismissal from the last job;  b) the employer should not make any deductions for you; and c) you should not be a student, retiree, founder, director of a legal entity or an individual entrepreneur. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ The following documents must be submitted to the Employment Center (CZN): passport, employment record, diploma, SNILS (pension insurance number), TIN, and details of your personal account in a savings bank.  There you fill in the necessary statements, you will be given all the forms. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ You will have to wait some time, during which the CZN will check the submitted documents (it took me about two weeks).  At the end of the audit, it will be decided to register you as an unemployed person.  By the way, from now on you will receive a small unemployment benefit. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ After receiving a copy of the order that you are unemployed, you must contact the CZN department for self-employment subsidy programs (in my CZN there was a special office), find out what form it is necessary to draw up a business plan and what documents need to be additionally provided for participation in this program.  You will sign some more papers, you will be given a brochure with explanations, and if you are lucky - a sample business plan.  In his image and likeness you will sculpt your "brick".  As a last resort, you can always find samples using you-know-what search engine. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ At the same time, it will be necessary to pass several simple tests with a psychologist working at the Central Hospital.  According to the results of the tests you will be given a document that you are recommended to allocate a subsidy for the organization of your own business.  It all took me half an hour. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ If there is not enough knowledge to organize one‚Äôs own business, seminars are organized at the Center of Healthcare where the basics of entrepreneurship are explained.  I myself have not been to any of the seminars, because I have experience both as a lawyer and a freelancer, so I don‚Äôt dare to judge how well they are trained and whether it is worthwhile to attend such seminars. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ After completing the work on the business plan, it must be submitted to the CZN department on work with subsidies.  If, on a formal basis, the business plan meets the requirements, it needs to be signed on each sheet and attach copies of all the same documents (passport, employment, TIN, etc., you will be prompted).  The CZN employee will definitely need to provide an electronic version of your business plan with all schedules, calculations, estimates, etc.  After that, the business plan will be sent to the financial commission. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Financial Commission - a special stage.  The review is carried out by independent experts who decide on either approval or the need to finalize the business plan in accordance with their wishes.  My "brick" was checked for two weeks, approved immediately. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ If the experts make a positive decision, sign an agreement with the Department of Labor and Employment of the Population (DTiZN) to provide you with a grant. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ In accordance with the concluded agreement, you register either an LLC or an individual entrepreneur, open a current account, with all supporting documents come to the Department of Technical and Social Safety in the period specified by the contract (I have it within 30 calendar days). <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Within 20 days after the DTP of all documents has been received, 327,000 rubles will be received by you on the current account. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Profit! <br><br>  It took more than three and a half months to implement this project (even though I had to spend eight hours every day at my, say, unofficial work). <br><br>  Of course, I described all this from memory and the only thing that moved me was to share with the habrasocial community a recipe for getting my money from the state.  If you have questions, I will be happy to answer them in the comments. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/133535/">https://habr.com/ru/post/133535/</a></p>
