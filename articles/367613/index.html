Acceptance of payments for the Internet and mobile phone is not carried out directly: the transaction takes place after the conversion of Bitcoins into rubles at the internal rate of the platform.  Cryptonator does not charge fees for making payments and, judging by the official release of the company, considers this feature one of its main competitive advantages. <br><br>  However, Vladimir Dubinin, the general director of the Distributed Lab, believes that if such services do not charge commission for payment, it means that the fee for their services lies in the ratio of exchange rates during currency conversion.

      ‚ÄúOne way or another, the commission is present,‚Äù <a href="http://cointelegraph.com/news/116026/russians-can-pay-internet-and-phone-bills-with-bitcoin-without-fees">says</a> Vladimir Dubinin. <br><br>  The second company that offers to pay online and mobile accounts with Bitcoin is 7pay.in.  The service has been around for three years and allows you to buy bitcoins, as well as make payments using bitcoins.  According to the founder of 7pay.in Dmitry Ermolaev, the service has already won the trust of 3,176 users.  7pay.in does not store customers' bitcoins, all information and statistics about payments made is available on the site. <br><br>  "All the bitcoins we store is the change from the payments made by our users, which is stored in their accounts until the next payment."  7pay.in does not require registration and password authentication. <br><br><h3>  Perspectives in Russia </h3><br>  Russian regulators are still unable to come to a consensus in assessing the legal status of Bitcoin, but are actively discussing a bill that equates cryptocurrencies to ‚Äúmoney substitutes‚Äù.  However, according to Vladimir Dubinin, such platforms can attract the attention of legislators only if they gain considerable popularity among users: <br><br>  ‚ÄúRegulators begin to impose sanctions on companies only if their services are really in demand in the market.  The more popular the service becomes, the stricter the sanctions will be. ‚Äù <br><br>  Co-owner of Intels Legal <a href="http://intelslegal.com/about-us/">intelslegal.com/about-us</a> and <a href="http://intelslegal.com/about-us/">legal</a> expert Dmitry Machikhin believes that since services do not use cryptocurrency directly - they only convert bitcoins into rubles and make final payments already in the national currency of Russia - then there are formal reasons for banning them there are no authorities. <br><br><h3>  The target audience </h3><br>  Some analysts of the cryptocurrency world are skeptical about the market opportunities of such services in Russia, as they believe that their services are not designed for beginners unfamiliar with Bitcoin, and are not focused on promoting cryptocurrency operations. <br><br>  Dmitry Vollo, founder of BitcoinFamily.org, Russia believes that cryptocurrency services should attract new users who are not involved in this industry, and the Bitcoin payments themselves should become primitively simple, accessible in a few mouse clicks.  The main mistake of these projects, he said, is that they focus on users who are already using cryptocurrency, and this is a direct path to failure.  ‚ÄúIf we consider the long-term perspective, we should offer those services that are somewhat different from traditional payments, those that may be of interest to Russian users.‚Äù <br><br>  Cloud mining <a href="https://hashflare.io/%3Flang%3Drus%26utm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3D269252">service Hashfare</a> reminds you that you can not only buy, but also get bitcoins to pay bills: <br><br> <a href="https://hashflare.io/%3Flang%3Drus%26utm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3D269252"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/eb1/57f/5f9/eb157f5f90f54032aa2b80b1c2973a73.png" alt="image"></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/367613/">https://habr.com/ru/post/367613/</a></p>
