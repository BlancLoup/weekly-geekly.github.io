  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Samsung has brought bloggers to Berlin and does not give return tickets without working off.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  These days, a big IFA exhibition is taking place in Berlin: a big celebration for everyone, but not for a couple of Indian bloggers who came to the event <a href="http://thenextweb.com/insider/2012/09/02/heres-samsung-flew-bloggers-halfway-around-world-threatened-leave/">at the invitation of Samsung</a> .  These guys were literally taken hostage: the company refuses to provide them with return tickets, demanding to work on the corporate stand in the company uniform. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/733/ac3/ae2/733ac3ae2560a8e5b46a25572daea292.jpg"><br><br>  Distributing free tickets or even product samples to bloggers is common for large companies.  Thus, they hope that the authors mention the company in their notes.  Samsung India also launched the Samsung Mob! Ler program in its own country.  There were a lot of those who wanted to, but two lucky tickets to Berlin won, including Clinton Jeff, the author of the blog <a href="http://unleashthephones.com/">Unleash the Phones</a> .  However, on arrival in Berlin, the bloggers were in for an unpleasant surprise. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Strange things began to happen on the very first day, when a Samsung spokesman warned bloggers about the need to come the next day at 8:00 in the morning to "target", sign an NDA and get Samsung uniforms.  The bloggers were perplexed, because they came here for another job: they wanted to be the first to write about their Note 2 and new products from other companies on their blogs.  What is NDA?

      But then it turned out worse.  It turned out that T-shirts are not a gift, but a uniform for work at the Samsung stand.  A company spokesman said that they were obliged to wear T-shirts and work all day at the exhibition booth, communicating with journalists and talking about the company's mobile devices. <br><br>  It was too much.  Bloggers explained that they came here to write news, and not to work at the company's booth.  They took the guys to one of the main PR specialists, who listened to them with a stern face and said that the company needed time to decide what to do in such a situation.  Soon, a representative of Samsung India phoned them and said that they would either work at the stand, or they would be canceled return flights from Berlin and expelled from the hotel.  A few minutes later, the threats came true: a company representative called again and said that the tickets for September 6 were canceled.  Moreover, they will not receive new tickets in the event that they tell someone about this conflict. <br><br>  The bloggers did not have money for return tickets, but they did not fully agree to the company's conditions: they took part in the Samsung Unpacked event, but refused to wear Samsung branded T-shirts and sneakers, for which they deserved disapproving views from bloggers from other countries - also program participants Samsung's Mob! Ler, - who worked in uniform. <br><br>  The next day, the bloggers received a letter demanding to leave the hotel as soon as possible, but they did not receive return tickets.  Clinton Jeff yesterday <a href="http://thenextweb.com/insider/2012/09/02/heres-samsung-flew-bloggers-halfway-around-world-threatened-leave/">shared this story with the press</a> .  He says that some other company agreed to help in this situation: they paid him the hotel until the end of the exhibition (September 5) and promised to buy tickets to their homeland. <br><br>  UPD.  <a href="http://karanbajaj.in/blog/2012/09/03/clearing-the-air-around-samsung-moblers-vs-indian-bloggers-fiasco/">A post</a> explaining some of the points and the difference between the status of reporters and promoters on the Samsung Mob! Ler.  In short, at first they took the guys as reporters, but at the last moment they reclassified themselves as promoters with their consent, without really explaining the essence of the work. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/288910/">https://habr.com/ru/post/288910/</a></p>
