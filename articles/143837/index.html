  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Sorry, the store on the record</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  When selling material goods, the need to make an inventory is perhaps the most unpleasant part of the work.  Everyone has become accustomed to dealing with virtual matters. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/58f/e8c/a07/58fe8ca0756fa8c8b51c15202945b88d.jpg"><br>  And why bother with anything at all considering goods in IM?  Why not confine ourselves with the phrases: ‚Äúmany, few, specify before ordering?‚Äù.  Because when we ourselves buy in IM, we don‚Äôt like to call and ask for the actual amount available for purchase.  Since the site has an online ordering mechanism, I want to be able to fully use it.  So, if you have to do an inventory, you will have to understand bar codes (CC) and scanners. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  We refused (see <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/angels-it/blog/143649/">retail vs IM</a> ) from 1C products and similar solutions.  This led to a simplified warehouse layout and ensured the relevance of the information, but the downside was the lack of ready-made solutions. <br><br>  We will explain, for those with whom we did not communicate in a personal, than we were not satisfied with the scheme with synchronization of databases (for example: site and 1C database).  Suppose there is 1 item in stock.  When a visitor moves a product to the basket, the quantity of goods available to other buyers does not change.  This product is written off only at checkout.  He managed - who first ordered the goods. <br>  Complicate the situation.  Imagine that there are several stores (warehouses), and the rate of receipt of orders, at least every few minutes.  How often should the base synchronize to guarantee up-to-date data?  How many servers?  How much does it all cost?  The only commodity base simplifies this system. <br><br>  <b>When implementing it was necessary to consider the following:</b> 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      <b>Mobility and scalability.</b>  Those.  the ability to quickly, with minimal cost, organize new jobs for sellers, ensuring linear growth of productivity.  Any computer (laptop) performance, USB Barcode Scanner and Barcode Printer with USB port will do. <br><br>  <b>Determine the structure of the CC.</b>  Use the code CC: Code128, because: <br><ul><li>  compactness of coding (2 digits for one CC module) </li><li>  the possibility of encoding letters.  For technical CCs, such as discount ID or check number, for example, on each check there is a CC that starts with the letter 'i' (i1234) </li><li>  understood by most HQ scanners </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/94f/dc5/fa6/94fdc5fa65194a819fe534d5155df2c4.png"><br>  Why a unique sequence number?  It allows you to track the entire history of a particular item.  For example, to whom and when was given to hire (take into account the wear).  From which batch of purchase this unit (at what price was purchased).  Due to the double control when packing it is impossible not to report the goods to the order (pick up) or, by chance, put the wrong size. <br><br>  <b>Select an input device</b> (port type, laser or optical) <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c23/bf4/5d0/c23bf45d02e4b5eed8dafcf1fc3fdf26.png"><br>  Optical Scanner Cipher 1000-USB HID <br>  Why he?  USB, keyboard emulation provides the ability to work through the web-interface.  Cheap.  There are no mechanical parts, so there is nothing to break.  The width of the scanned barcode is up to 67mm, in our case the label is 43x25mm in size.  The size of the label was chosen for the smallest product. <br>  Why do not we use a laser, because it should be long-range and faster?  Tried it.  For correct operation, the laser scanner necessarily requires a contrast printing of CC.  Our printer in quick print mode does not provide this. <br><br>  <b>Printer QC and paper type for it.</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/749/00a/8f3/74900a8f3392ab9810a38b11f7c0e612.png"><br>  Our hero is a thermal label printer Zebra LP 2824 Plus. <br>  Why he?  The modest price, USB interface, is defined in the system as an ordinary usb printer (printing from a browser), printing width from 25 to 60 mm (we have 43 mm), a label break sensor (it is looking for the beginning of the next label), a compact size. <br>  The paper is a self-adhesive thermal label of 4.3x2.5 cm, 1000 labels, 4 cm sleeve, white. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f20/884/48e/f2088448e7bbaace3cfd71a2578e4bd9.jpg"><br>  This scheme allows with a satisfactory probability to ensure that the current quantity of goods is displayed to the visitor.  This gives sellers confidence to communicate with customers.  For example, a week ago an employee from the St. Petersburg office of Yandex ordered a sombrero and twice asked again about the actual available quantity.  We insisted that everything is exactly as written on the site. <br><br>  <b>And if the product is currently out of stock?</b> <br>  Then we offer to leave your phone or email.  When goods arrive at the warehouse, messages are sent to interested people.  Usually, 10 minutes after the newsletter, people start placing orders. <br><br>  <b>What could be done better?</b> <br><ul><li>  Do not indicate the price on the labels.  We want to experience a price checker in stores.  You have to rewrite prices for various reasons, and this is not for you to correct the figure in CMS. </li><li>  immediately begin to indicate the date of the inventory on the label.  So you can save a lot of time on the inventory of only some part of the goods. </li></ul><br><br>  Good luck! <br>  Write comments.  It is interesting to hear your opinion. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/143837/">https://habr.com/ru/post/143837/</a></p>
