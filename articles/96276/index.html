I have nothing against these devices and the same ASUS (which basically give me ‚Äúbeeches‚Äù for the test), but just a few palls, and the interest of the audience is not at all - whatever the finish or stuffing. <br><br>  But it is quite another thing when the device is somehow unusual - for such I gladly undertake.  Well, for example, the hero of this review is a netbook from the Finnish company Nokia, which never specializes on netbooks, but as far as I know, the adjacent market is a leader.  Here, at least it is interesting to look at what happened - even if everything is obviously bad with characteristics.  And here, by the way, everything is not so bad - even despite the fact that the netbook has been around for more than a year and managed to morally degrade.  I admit honestly - I didn‚Äôt even expect that the Finns are capable of SUCH debut. <br><br>  What is such a debut at?  Read!

    <h2>  Intro </h2><br>  The device is completely called <b><a href="http://europe.nokia.com/find-products/mini-laptops/nokia-booklet-3g/">Nokia Booklet 3G</a></b> .  It all started a big oblong blue box of blue cardboard.  I open it, which means that I, with my brows furrowed, take out something with a glossy black lid. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e72/cf7/eef/e72cf7eef9e6ee83c31bb2d9aac923db.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  At first it was immediately upset - the only netbook from the company, and this beginning ... but then reacted with understanding.  After all, what is terrible in the glossy cover (it is really stamped), prints?  Maybe, but there it is easier to wipe them there, and during work it doesn‚Äôt strike at all.  So I "went" further. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0cb/e63/464/0cbe63464f1620a8f9b25ed60cdd5f94.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  And then waited continuous pleasant surprises.  For example, here, the package bundle - in the package there was another box with the words ‚ÄúHello Hei!‚Äù (‚ÄúHello, Habr!‚Äù From Finnish), inside which there was a wired stereo headset with a microphone (quite good in quality for its class - ‚Äúout of the box on first time "), a Y-shaped cord for charging two devices from the USB port;  fibrate rag;  small, but detailed and color manual. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/771/0ce/9b2/7710ce9b204bcf66ebc805d494f4989e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/db1/275/961/db12759617a5de01f5a7b76ed75abdb4.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/acf/1a1/eac/acf1a1eac948f580c63f3ce612f49c43.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/897/701/9e4/8977019e45f7a71360078cbb76ab406b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In such an ordinary device as the power supply unit of the charger, something unusual also occurred - it contained a small chute for winding the wire. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8aa/232/ed6/8aa232ed6ba3880cac3563daf43821fe.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  All this slowly ‚Äúsmoothed out‚Äù in my eyes the guilt of the glossy lid) Next - no less interesting. <br><br><h2>  Appearance </h2><br>  Full metal case, very, very similar to the MacBook.  Silver aluminum, perfect fit, pleasant chill - class. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/de2/f5b/b0d/de2f5bb0d7a6830e21a6406c2473272a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Unusual and elements that are present on the netbook.  Firstly, this is an HDMI port - for the same ASUS, I know very few models (for example, EeePC 1201n) with this connector. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b37/ee7/17f/b37ee717f709303f3701fee5b24d85aa.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Three USB ports, a minijack for headphones (there is no microphone minijack, which no one ever uses, no), a power connector and a latch for the SD and SIM card slot.  On the side ends and there is a power button - very unusual.  Two speakers on opposite sides.  There is no RJ-45 or VGA - are they needed? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bef/80e/77f/bef80e77fd424b4e10cb93797976eb53.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a02/443/dc5/a02443dc52923f46603d85a0616e4f25.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5dc/e7c/a29/5dce7ca296f4458f0dea8e5ce4b4f5a1.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Minimalism reigns on the bottom - there is nothing but 4 rubber feet and two clamps of a lithium-polymer battery (16 cells, 3840 mAh, 57 W / h). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/26c/a8a/932/26ca8a932b10a19705382b341f27da89.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The back is also empty - just a display hinge, very similar to the one used in my <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/asus/blog/69249/">EeePC 1002HA</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/520/d03/2eb/520d032eb0340780fc14ccf4f4f08430.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/99d/62b/5e6/99d62b5e63b5ec462fb665939a162cbf.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Dimensions are exactly the same as most 10 "- inch netbooks (265x185x), more weight (1250 grams with battery) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f15/9b9/130/f159b9130815a168486b597df210fdbd.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/fb7/74c/0e8/fb774c0e8df5ce8cac8c64f0f7b940c3.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  ... but a small thickness is another plus (only 20 mm). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1e6/898/feb/1e6898febe7f5776da61545b514f8144.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The screen and webcam are hidden behind the glass, which smoothly passes into the metal frame of the case - yes, again the gloss, but here it is easy to wipe it with the same rag from the kit.  But ... but the screen resolution is already 1280x720! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/151/672/ede/151672edee51ca47fb13d99ddd2706db.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The place under the screen is not very rational.  Despite the fact that the button in (s) switches and speakers are placed on the side, and all the LEDs on the hinge ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/065/a1b/72b/065a1b72b993c64e84b3075e65d7ca54.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  ... keyboard buttons are very small. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/349/7b6/ee7/3497b6ee7c1fa8f6aee1acc2ecfebc79.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  There are gaps between them, but this is also no excuse - in the same EeePC with equal sizes, buttons, LEDs, a large touchpad and quite large keyboard buttons fit on the case.  So strange. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/922/500/659/9225006594d4ff7417126987fb2750e4.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The rest of the clave is very good - a small and quiet keystroke;  convenient fn-functions spread on the F1-F12 buttons (except for the fact that Fn is to the left of the Ctrl key).  In the CapsLock button there is a status indicator.  The arrows are combined in one pile, which I never liked. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/923/e34/e45/923e34e45488504c9da68766a87854a9.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Touchpad from Synaptics and without multitouch support - a pity.  The click is also quite loud, but pleasantly resilient. <br><br>  The whole space around the keyboard and touchpad is matte and also made of aluminum - lepota! <br><br><h2>  Turn on and work </h2><br>  I‚Äôd like to say right now that there‚Äôs not much to expect in this section, because last year‚Äôs netbook, which means neither Ion, nor something tasty there.  Although everything is relative - you can work on such a machine. <br><br>  So, the pre-installed Windows 7 is fully loaded in about 35 seconds and in the future it does not slow down at all.  What I immediately noticed was that the netbook ... is absolutely silent!  No, disk chirping is audible, but no more - apparently, not the hottest filling is cooled passively at the expense of the metal case.  Strange, but the latter is almost not heated ... although not - under load, the battery heats up pretty well, but you can easily work without a stand. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6f6/8ce/0a5/6f68ce0a56499792bf0ec7d0f68ff4e0.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The screen is beautiful in all senses - from high resolution to color reproduction and good viewing angles on the sides (not very top-bottom).  But bad, as I said, gloss - prints and highlights are inevitable. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9a6/c93/194/9a6c9319449920ab5ed9887f6c880677.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  About stuffing.  The processor is an <b><a href="http://ark.intel.com/Product.aspx%3Fid%3D35463">Intel Atom Z530</a></b> with a frequency of 1.6 GHz, on an Intel Poulsbo US15W chipset unknown to me.  1GB of RAM and an integrated <b>Intel GMA500</b> video system - well, everything is just like in pioneer netbooks.  Another of the buns is a 1.3 megapixel camera, Wi-Fi b / g / n, built-in Bluetooth 2.1 and A-GPS module. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e38/b7d/ba8/e38b7dba8ab185d274dbb43b23a08bcb.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/00f/f22/618/00ff22618cd48b51ff51a2317496d615.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Separately, I want to note the presence of a SIM-card slot ... which I did not manage to use :) The fact is that the netbook came to me in a very unusual way, there were no pre-installed programs on it or anything else.  I tried to install the Noka OviSuite program, but this had no effect on working with the SIM card.  But, I think, if there are two straight arms and a bright head (I still have neither the one nor the other), the connector can be used for its intended purpose.  Accordingly, there is practically nothing to tell me about one of the key features (because the netbook is called the Nokia Booklet 3G).  I will write only what the manufacturer writes about this in the specifications: built-in 3G modem (data calls only), WCDMA 900/2100 or 800-850 / 900/2100. <br><br>  The performance index is only 2.2 (rests on percent) out of a possible 7.9, which is quite expected.  I also did not torture the device with calculations of synthetic tests, because the result is still approximately known. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c8a/aa6/1bf/c8aaa61bfbfaa3dabcc68e9c150cdce2.png" alt="image"><br><br>  But from the pleasant moments - the netbook easily lost almost all videos (except FullHD), which I offered him - up to 720p.  Without any brakes and out of sync. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/93f/db4/f67/93fdb4f67f801a007ce4271b349caa29.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The only thing that I didn‚Äôt like very much was the sound ‚Äúleaving‚Äù to the sides, some kind of deaf.  But if you use headphones (but at least from the kit), then a couple of movies in good quality will easily have a netbook on one charge.  Well, or for output kin on the big screen via HDMI - why not. <br><br>  Inside a Toshiba 120GB hard drive (4200 rpm) is installed, the speed indicators of which are sooo questionable: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/575/d66/75c/575d6675c66981906744c7276752fc4a.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b8e/6e1/499/b8e6e149944835bee9003b1fc2af4c5c.png" alt="image"><br><br>  At maximum brightness, the device can work for about 8 hours, although knowledgeable people claim that this time the netbook is able to play video, and ordinary office work can easily take 10-12 hours. <br><br><h2><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/af2/94a/228/af294a2281f2c106ec7aac2f877a8602.png" alt="image">  Check weighing </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/881/117/ccb/881117ccbc836c685868fb19a2bf46c1.png" alt="+">  Excellent build quality and fit parts <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/881/117/ccb/881117ccbc836c685868fb19a2bf46c1.png" alt="+">  Stylish and compact brushed metal body <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/881/117/ccb/881117ccbc836c685868fb19a2bf46c1.png" alt="+">  High screen resolution <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/881/117/ccb/881117ccbc836c685868fb19a2bf46c1.png" alt="+">  Completely silent <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/881/117/ccb/881117ccbc836c685868fb19a2bf46c1.png" alt="+">  Support 3G, GPS, Wi-Fi n <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/881/117/ccb/881117ccbc836c685868fb19a2bf46c1.png" alt="+">  Long battery life <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/24f/0ae/920/24f0ae920b085ead2e6d649649177122.png" alt="-">  No Ethernet port <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/24f/0ae/920/24f0ae920b085ead2e6d649649177122.png" alt="-">  Glossy cover and screen <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/24f/0ae/920/24f0ae920b085ead2e6d649649177122.png" alt="-">  No multitouch <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/24f/0ae/920/24f0ae920b085ead2e6d649649177122.png" alt="-">  Keyboard buttons are rather small, Fn is to the left of Ctrl <br><br>  By and large, all the minuses are not serious - I never used the Wi-Fi only network port on my netbook, glossy covers and screens are almost everywhere today, and many do not use multitouch, preferring the mouse.  The buttons on the keyboard are small, yes, but you can get used to it ... remember at least the first EeePC.  Fn and Ctrl cannot be changed in BIOS in places, but, as far as I know, somehow it can be solved by software, this is also not so scary.  But the pros ... much more pleasant. <br><br><h2>  Total </h2><br>  Apparently, Nokia has watched the netbook market a lot and not only - thoughtfully read into the reviews of other models, took into account the minuses and advantages, absorbed the most juices and ... and once gave birth to her brainchild.  The netbook is definitely a success, in all senses - in it the same ASUS-am (after all, they made the first mass netbook) have something to wind on a mustache. <br>  The usual sizes and weight, but at the same time the metal case and the screen with high resolution;  weak for our time stuffing, but at the same time capacious battery - I think if the company continued to produce devices of this class, then they would definitely use some success. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/11c/52e/312/11c52e3126d25a82dd7f66562aca163b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  For now ... for now it is a pity that the device practically does not occur in the Russian market.  If you wish, you can order it from abroad, as I did - thanks to the kind people from <b><a href="http://amac.ru/">amac.ru</a></b> , who once again brought an interesting gadget for the test. <br><br>  <b>Successes!</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/96276/">https://habr.com/ru/post/96276/</a></p>
