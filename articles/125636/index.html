  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Insight Remote Support is a powerful tool for ensuring uninterrupted operation of HP servers and storage systems.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Many small and large companies around the world periodically face a decline in the performance of their business-critical applications and a decline in the quality of IT services that may be caused by a failure in one of the components of their IT infrastructure.  To minimize potential losses, companies need to quickly detect the root cause of such failures and promptly take measures to eliminate them, as much as possible by automating these operations. <br><br>  Back in the 1990s, HP offered various remote monitoring tools for different lines of its equipment.  Perhaps some of the experienced administrators still remember tools such as PRS, HAO and HPFN, Predictive.  In 2001, the company introduced the new HP Instant Support Enterprise Edition (ISEE) product, which provides event and configuration management for servers and storage devices.  The continuation of the ISEE technology was the HP Service Essentials Remote Support Pack (RSP) released in 2007, which allows you to integrate monitoring tools into a single console for managing the HP Systems Insight Manager infrastructure.  The first release had version number 05.00.  In the spring of 2009, when version 05.20 was released, the products were merged into the HP Insight Software and RSP portfolio and renamed HP Insight Remote Support (IRS).  Thus, this product has a long history and at the same time it has been actively developing, for example, from 2007 to the present, eight releases of this product have been released. <br><br>  HP Insight Remote provides simple, reliable round-the-clock monitoring with advanced failure detection and alert functions, and automatically generates service requests to the HP support center.  According to HP itself, the use of IRS averages up to 20% faster resolution of problems and gives almost 100% accuracy of their diagnostics.

This software solution implements all the basic functions of remote monitoring and diagnostics.  To deploy it, you need an HP ProLiant server running under Windows that can run other Windows applications.  HP Insight Remote Support Standard supports all HP server lines (with the exception of non-stop NonStop servers) and HP StorageWorks storage systems (except XP and P9000 disk arrays). </li><li>  For large enterprises, HP Insight Remote Support Advanced edition is intended.  This solution is capable of serving almost all HP equipment, as well as some models of standard Dell and IBM architecture servers.  As the name suggests, it implements advanced remote monitoring and diagnostic functions, including report generation and integration with a powerful system management tool like HP System Insight Management (SIM).  HP Insight Remote Support Advanced deploys on a dedicated HP ProLiant server. </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/d4b55e5c/74838520/2a9910f8/c2d66937.jpg"><br><h6>  Proliant server page in SIM </h6><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/2c45fb98/2fc6865c/b2da38b4/b8c3ff7b.jpg"><br><h6>  Perform System Identification in SIM </h6><br>  While other leading server vendors offer similar remote support tools, only HP delivers it for free, provided that the customer has a valid hardware warranty for the company, or he purchased the HP Care Pack, or entered into an agreement with HP for a support agreement.  Moreover, if the customer has a contract or he wants to connect the equipment to the monitoring during the installation, then HP will free of charge for the customer to work on installing and configuring the IRS. <br><br>  The North-West branch of Megafon mobile operator, which has more than a hundred HP servers and storage systems installed in four data centers, has signed a contract to support HP Mission Critical Partnership.  After introducing HP Insight Remote Support Advanced, this customer‚Äôs fivefold reduction in the number of system administrators ‚Äôcalls to HP support, there were also fewer complaints about the quality of IT services from users and company management, and the average troubleshooting time decreased by a quarter. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/863a4884/b0e80bad/ffda5df6/ec264b29.jpg"><br><h6>  Simplified IRS Advanced Chart </h6><br>  HP IRS Advanced automatically tracks all changes in system configurations, and based on the analysis of the data collected by them, HP support center specialists assess the condition of the systems and the likelihood of equipment failures, quickly and accurately diagnose the failure, and for customers with a contract based on these data make various reports.  In addition, HP Services, based on data from HP IRS Advanced, automated the installation of software patches on servers and storage systems of the Northwest MegaFon.  Prior to the implementation of this solution, several employees of the customer‚Äôs IT department only worked on analyzing system logs all working day; now they are transferred to more creative work on planning the deployment of new systems, therefore the IT department did not need to expand the staff of system administrators. <br><br>  An English-language description of the introduction of HP IRS Advanced in the North-West ‚ÄúMegaphone‚Äù can be found <a href="http://h20195.www2.hp.com/V2/GetPDF.aspx/4AA2-0630ENW.pdf">here</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/125636/">https://habr.com/ru/post/125636/</a></p>
