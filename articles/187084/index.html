      When lightning strikes the surface of the World Ocean, a hydrogen explosion occurs, and with a successful combination of water depth and bottom relief, impact direction and voltage, pulse duration and duration of its front, a huge single wave is formed as a result of pulsed electrolysis of the surface layer of water article.  Not the last role in the phenomenon plays a resonance. <br>  In the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2591%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25BC%25D1%2583%25D0%25B4%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9_%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D1%2583%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA">Bermuda Triangle,</a> these conditions are most often met, so he received his notorious fame. <br>  Approximately one million of the 250 million lightning that hit the surface of the oceans every year gives rise to a super-wave. <br>  The white wave - the water saturated with gases, into which the crews of low-flying aircraft fall, is not fiction and it is present in the experiments.  The electromagnetic pulse (EMP) arising from a lightning strike that disrupts navigation equipment also fits into this theory. <br>  Unlike other exotic methods of water ignition, the considered variant is simple and has 100% repeatability.  Experience shows the tremendous speed and performance of water electrolysis under a short pulse effect, and also allows you to safely investigate the electro-hydraulic effect and lightning in laboratory conditions.  The device can be used to study the conditions of the formation of stray waves.  In the future, the creation of automatic devices that will generate an oncoming wave for extinguishing destructive tsunamis and killer waves in protected coastal zones will become a reality. <br><br>  The assumption is verified and confirmed on a small layout.  GIF-animation ‚ÄúWater‚Äù - waveforms: ‚Äúsingle tower‚Äù, ‚Äúwhite wall‚Äù, as well as wonder-eye with eyes and other beautiful elements of water, obtained at the initial voltage of 145 volts for the effect, are shown in the text above. <br>  Anyone can repeat the experience and check the assumption. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  When the electrode is on the surface of the liquid, the effect of burning water is easily achieved. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f48/92a/ec3/f4892aec3290dbda4bdb0043066ae501.gif"><br>  Animation ‚ÄúWater is burning‚Äù <br><br>  <b>Flint for water.</b> <br>  More than a year ago, an article entitled ‚Äú <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/144252/">Pulsed Electrolysis at the Google Science Fair</a> ‚Äù was published, where a battery version of a pulsed electrolyzer was used in water burning experiments.  Since then, much salt water has flowed and a new version of the device, called the water match (VS), has been created.  The battery version from the previous article will be VS-1, today's network will be VS-2. <br>  Key features of the devices are: <br>  - thin electrode - the thinner the better; <br>  - work on the surface of the liquid or in depth, using an isolated along the length of the cathode; <br>  - pulsed operation; <br>  - short pulse time and long pause; <br>  - steep front of the pulse; <br>  - water with high salinity as a working fluid. <br><br>  Hydrogen is released from water during a pulse effect on the surface layer using a thin cathode (a negative electrode, if anyone does not know, and I constantly forget it) and instantly burns in the presence of oxygen.  The process of excretion / combustion is very fast, therefore it has an explosive character.  Fortunately, the inhabitants of the planet, the process is damped - as much hydrogen is released during the pulse, so much and burns.  The device uses salt water, as fresh water requires large voltages to create similar sizes of hydrogen flame. <br>  The operation of the device is based on the electrohydraulic effect (EGE), discovered by the great Russian scientist <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/yutkin1911/biografia-l-a-utkin">Yutkin</a> .  So that no one was hurt, it can be argued that in other countries, this effect operated long before its discovery in the form of an ordinary <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259C%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F">lightning</a> .  But even the usual lightning has not yet been fully studied - elves, jets, sprites, as well as cosmic rays to start the process confirm this. <br>  In devices operating on the EGE effect, high voltage, arresters, and other large and dangerous things are required.  But salt water and modern components allow you to assemble the device on the basis of a handle from an old soldering iron, using a relatively low operating voltage.  Although not without a microcontroller, the scheme is available for repetition by any radio amateur. <br><br>  In the previous experiment with water ignition, my role was to create a pulsed electrolyzer.  The results of the experiments turned out to be interesting, but instead of studying the EGE, the daughter is preparing for the EGE - this newfangled hobby more and more absorbs the minds and time of the younger youth, as well as their parents' money.  Therefore, there will be little experimental data in this story; those who want to read the details can do this in the previous <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/144252/">article</a> .  I have satisfied my interest with the creation of a more powerful device and a short film. <br><br>  <b>Theory of EGE.</b> <br>  Yutkin in his experiments used a voltage of only 20 ... 50 kV or more, and the capacity was up to 1 microfarad.  The theory was published in the work ‚ÄúElectrohydraulic effect and its application in industry‚Äù, in the format djVu is <a href="https://docs.google.com/leaf%3Fid%3D0BxY-b2sIjkXGOTczOWVkYzItMWQyMC00ZmY1LTg0YWUtOGMxMmIyYTQxOGRj%26sort%3Dname%26layout%3Dlist%26num%3D50">here</a> . <br>  What is happening when a lightning strikes a water with its voltage of millions and billions of volts is difficult to imagine, since the energy stored in a capacitor and released during its discharge is proportional to the square of the voltage and is determined by the formula: W = CU ^ 2/2. <br><br>  Compared with the dischargers of Yutkin and the more so with lightning, VS-2 is a child's toy, but it allows you to explore the phenomenon in safe modes in a glass on the table.  The above formula for calculating energy can be used only partially, since BC-2 controls the amount of energy supplied to the cathode and the capacitor is not completely discharged. <br><br>  According to the theory of EGE, it is believed that the reason for the increase in fluid pressure is the expansion of the vapor-air mixture resulting from the instantaneous boiling up of the fluid in the streamer channel due to its enormous temperature. <br>  But according to the results of previous experiments with VS-1, it can be concluded that the source of pressure growth is the enormous rate of electrolysis, and therefore the release of hydrogen and its subsequent burning at high speed (explosion) in the presence of oxygen dissolved in water. <br>  That is, when discharging, an almost instantaneous decomposition of water molecules into hydrogen atoms ‚Äî fuel and oxygen ‚Äî an oxidizer occurs, and a subsequent explosion of an explosive mixture in the cathode zone (oxygen is dissolved in water and replenished from the anode zone). <br>  Most likely, the observed boiling of the liquid occurs as a result of cavitation, after the explosion of hydrogen. <br>  The greater the current density (determined by the voltage and diameter of the cathode), and the shorter the pulse front, the greater the number of water molecules involved in the electrolysis process and the more hydrogen is released at each pulse. <br>  It can be concluded that in EGE primary is high-speed electrolysis, which gives rise to all subsequent effects. <br><br>  Thunder - the sound of lightning, is the result of an explosion of hydrogen during the decomposition of water molecules in the atmosphere.  But if in the atmosphere, due to the low density and high compressibility of air, only an explosion is heard, then waves form in the water. <br>  Each explosion is individual.  The complex nature of the fluid movement is illustrated by a photograph with the ‚Äúmiracle-yud‚Äù, where the trajectory of the heated end of the electrode is visible after the explosion. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e79/519/74f/e7951974f4bcb6c1e9b5a9b557d2e31e.jpg"><br><br>  The study of pulsed electrolysis at the air-liquid interface, as well as using a thin closed electrode immersed in a liquid, will allow studying the phenomenon in more detail.  These experiments are the beginning of experiments, which it is desirable to continue with the use of modern scientific instruments, more advanced measuring and recording techniques.  It is desirable to measure the level of EMR.  In some video fragments (especially when using a high-speed transistor), there is a noticeable ‚Äúchoking‚Äù of the sound path of the camera, which is caused by the effect of EMP on the microphone or its overload due to a sharp sound, it is not clear. <br><br>  <b>Creation of VS-2.</b> <br>  The basis of the electrical circuit of VS-2 was taken from the previous development of a pulsed electrolyzer VS-1. <br>  The transformer shown in the diagram is any available and it is outside the VS-2 board.  It can not be used if the power is produced from the mains  But at the same time there is a risk of electric shock. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4c4/988/5ba/4c49885babf60db012dc1edebd5a3158.png"><br><br>  The PIC12F675 microcontroller is used as the master oscillator, which forms the required pulse duration. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9ee/253/825/9ee25382572eee831ca7ac67228d7ce5.jpg"><br><br>  Surplus voltage (expected to work up to 800 V) is extinguished on the ballast resistor, which is made from the assembly of semi-watt resistors.  The efficiency of the pulse generator and high duty cycle of the work contribute to the low level of power allocated to this resistor.  A series connection and a large number of resistors prevent them from breaking at extreme voltages. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/55f/462/0f9/55f4620f9de7ab5fafcaf9c05f9c596b.jpg"><br><br>  This version of the power supply was chosen because of its simplicity, reliability, and also due to the fact that it was supposed to work not from a 220 V network, where only 311 V can be obtained on storage capacitors, but from a separation step-up transformer, which allows a significant increase in voltage.  From what was available, a circuit of three transformers was assembled and an alternating voltage of 544 V was obtained, from which 769 V of direct voltage is obtained after rectification and filtration.  This is already something, compared to the 145 V used in the VS-1. <br><br>  From previous experiments, it became clear that one of the factors affecting the performance of the installation is the minimum duration of the pulse front, so the circuitry of the device is aimed at increasing the slope: <br>  - short length of electrodes and wires, placement of power elements in the immediate vicinity of the electrodes to reduce the inductance of the power part of the circuit; <br>  - powerful driver MOSFET TC4452, controlling the power transistor; <br>  - the newest super-duper transistor as a speed switch: CREE Z-FET ‚Ñ¢ MOSFET on silicon carbide (SiC) CMF10120D with parameters Qg = 47 nC, maximum voltage 1200 V, resistance RDS (on) = 160 mŒ© and a pulse current of 49 A. <br>  When debugging on the layout (working on long wires) everything worked fine.  After installing the soldering iron on the handle and reducing the length of the conductors to the electrodes, the first copy of the key did not withstand work at a high voltage of 769 volts and was replaced with its twin brother.  With its high cost, it was a shock.  The development of power electronics is a costly area of ‚Äã‚Äãactivity. <br>  The second copy also could not last long.  Most likely, a voltage surge occurs when the pulse is disconnected, and the transistor crashes to exceed the maximum voltage, adding to the list of victims of the experiment.  The result of the control measurement - breakdown of all conclusions.  Next time, in the presence of a large number of transistors, you can search for the area of ‚Äã‚Äãsafe operation between 311 and 769 V. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e61/90d/355/e6190d355dc6c1ec7a5abb69a0aa111f.jpg"><br><br>  When the device operates, the breakdown of the transistor is observed as follows: the pulse duration is no longer limited by the controller, and on the electrode, when touching the surface of the water, significant energy is released.  The electrode does not stand up and burns a little, spraying copper particles - it works as a fuse.  The fragment is visible in the middle of the film ‚ÄúThe water is burning!‚Äù (Lower down the course). <br><br>  In addition to reducing the duration of the front, another way to increase hydrogen production, and therefore the height of the flame, is to increase the voltage on the electrodes.  It was supposed to receive a voltage pulse up to 800 V, so I had to use a pair of capacitors.  Two series-connected capacitors 47 microfarads x 450 V give a resultant capacitance of 23.5 microfarads x 900 V. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b0e/e53/2ff/b0ee532ff94f7ec25aec196fa0cf3b95.jpg"><br><br>  The heroic storage capacitors used in the circuit, like Ilya Muromets, lay for a very long time, so they were <a href="http://qrx.narod.ru/arhn2/kon.htm">molded</a> .  For this, for two days, the series-connected capacitors were under a rectified mains voltage of 220 V. On the first day, the voltage on them changed as follows: <br>  C1 - 241, 235, 216, 203, 196, 190, 187, 184, 179, 175, 172, 165, 162, 155, 154 V. <br>  C2 - 065, 072, 104, 120, 127, 134, 139, 141, 145, 148, 154, 160, 159, 153, 153 V. <br>  The total voltage on the capacitors depends on the magnitude of the mains voltage in accordance with the formula U = 220x1.414 = 311 V. On the second day, the voltage difference did not exceed 1 volt, which is an indicator of the end of the molding process. <br><br>  The BC-2 handle is taken from the EPSN soldering iron 220 V, 40 W.  It has recesses and stops that allow you to securely fix the printed circuit board with the elements. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2b0/c84/af7/2b0c84af7a61b0dff7b85ac7e7ddec80.jpg"><br><br>  When the device operates, there is a significant dispersion of salt water droplets; therefore, the device components are located inside the protective plastic bottle. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d9d/293/208/d9d293208e4874ee0ec305337b6c5fa1.jpg"><br><br>  As it was proved in experiments with VS-1, the height of the flame is dependent on the thickness of the electrode.  VS-2 electrodes are made of copper wire with a diameter of 1.7 mm.  The anode should be much larger than the cathode. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/39f/156/354/39f156354902229d75d25df9ee8c8a58.jpg"><br><br>  A thin copper cathode with a diameter of 0.07 mm (less could not be found) was soldered to the end of the supporting electrode.  When reducing the diameter, it is necessary to select the pulse parameters (voltage, duration, pause) so that the electrode practically does not collapse with a short pulse effect. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d5f/6cf/c79/d5f6cfc7932fafaa9f35b94bae7950ff.jpg"><br><br>  As follows from experiments with BC-1, a hydrogen funnel forms and a fluid surface oscillates.  During subsequent pulses, the waves are incident on the electrode, and the surface explosion turns into an underwater one ‚Äî the electrode is ‚Äúflooding‚Äù and the height of the hydrogen flame decreases.  It is difficult to hold the electrode accurately on the surface in a strong storm with one hand (the other handles the process of photographing).  To facilitate the task, in the VS-2 program, the pulse duration is halved to 100 microseconds, and the duration of the pause between pulses is tripled to 300 ms compared with the BC-1 work program. <br><br>  <b>Program of work VS-2.</b> <br>  start: <br>  HIGH GPIO.2 'key enable <br>  PAUSEUS 100 'pulse width 100 ¬µs <br>  LOW GPIO.2 'key disable <br>  PAUSE 300 'pause duration 300 ms <br>  GOTO start <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Completion of the program</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><br>  If you enable the inclusion of pull-up resistors and install a miniature switch between the outputs of the controller 7 and 8, then you can make two frequencies of output pulses: <br>  @ DEVICE INTRC_OSC_NOCLKOUT, MCLR_OFF, WDT_ON, CPD_OFF, PWRT_ON, PROTECT_ON, BOD_ON 'BANDGAP0_ON <br>  'internal 4MHz, GP4 and GP5 generator functions as I / O ports <br>  'MCLR is internally connected to power, GP3 works as an input port channel <br>  WDT Watchdog Enabled <br>  'CPD EEPROM data memory protection disabled <br>  'PROTECT program memory protection enabled <br>  'ON = enabled - enabled = allowed, OFF = disabled - disabled = disabled <br><br>  INCLUDE "modedefs.bas" <br>  DEFINE NO_CLRWDT 1 'do not insert CLRWDT <br>  DEFINE OSC 4 <br><br>  'Configure the controller <br>  OPTION_REG =% 01111111 'let's turn on the pull-up resistors, connect the pre-splitter to the WDT, <br>  'division ratio for WDT = 1: 128 (at F = 4 MHz, the off time is about 2.8 seconds) <br>  ANSEL = 0 'digital mode of analog inputs <br>  CMCON =% 00000111 'shutdown of the comparator <br><br>  'Text of the program <br><br>  start: <br>  CLEARWDT <br>  HIGH GPIO.2 <br>  PAUSEUS 100 '100 microseconds <br>  LOW GPIO.2 <br>  IF GPIO.0 = 0 THEN <br>  PAUSE 100 '100 ms <br>  ELSE <br>  PAUSE 300 '300 ms <br>  ENDIF <br>  GOTO start <br>  END <br></div></div><br>  <b>Photo and video</b> <br>  Splashes of water spread from the electrode at a distance of more than a meter, so the survey had to be carried out at a great distance. <br>  It is necessary to use a protective glass on the lens and it is desirable to cover the camera, since salt water for electronics is not very good. <br>  Ideally, it is desirable to use a high-speed camera, but for lack of one, the shooting was carried out on a Nikon D7000 DSLR camera with a 18-105 mm lens. <br>  Photographing is best done in manual mode, as with a small impulse time the automatics cannot cope. <br>  Before shooting, as accurately as possible, focus the device fixed on the tripod to the place of the intended explosions with the help of an additional high-contrast object, since it is difficult to catch the focus on water.  By trial shooting set exposure time. <br>  Now you can calculate the probability of obtaining a successful snapshot: <br>  - pulse time - 100 microseconds; <br>  - pause between pulses - 0.3 sec; <br>  - the rate of fire of the device in continuous high-speed mode - 6 frames per second; <br>  - shutter speed set for the image - 1/100 sec. <br>  That is, the probability is extremely low. <br>  The rate of hydrogen release is huge, so it‚Äôs impossible to get a clear image of the flame of a flame with such exposure.  By reducing the shutter speed for a beautiful shot of a flame post, we make it even less likely that the flash will hit the frame.  Alternatively, you can try the devices for automatic synchronization, but these devices are missing. <br>  All flashes caught during the shooting, as well as other photos related to this project, can be viewed in the <a href="https://plus.google.com/photos/116668088451857322516/albums/5901155863218922449">album</a> .  When analyzing images, it is clear that each blow is individual, although the electrode is located almost equally.
