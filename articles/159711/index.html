As usual, I have prepared a list of novelties of computer or computer-related writers in Russian and English that have recently appeared, or will appear some time soon. <br>  This is not a list of reviews, but only a list of books that I myself will read with pleasure in the near future.  So my opinion is based more on the name of the author and some "weighted average" opinions of the people on our Internet sites, and it may well change after a closer acquaintance with these creations.  Nevertheless, all of them, at least, deserve our attention and deserve to be added to the endless list of books on the ‚Äúto-read‚Äù shelf. <br clear="all"><br clear="all"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h5>  1.

At the same time, the main feature of such a list is that it is very small and that new books get into it quite rarely.  The Sasha Goldstein book is exactly the type of books that can be safely attributed to such a list of books and recommend to most .NET developers interested in the efficiency of their applications and the internal structure of the CLR. <br>  In general, I highly recommend!  I have this book is one of the first to-read! <br>  <b>Links</b> : <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Pro-NET-Performance-Applications-Professional/dp/1430244585/ref%3Dsr_1_1%3Fs%3Dbooks%26amp%3Bie%3DUTF8%26amp%3Bqid%3D1352742820%26amp%3Bsr%3D1-1%26amp%3Bkeywords%3Dpro%2B.net%2Bperformance">amazon.com</a> <br><br><h5>  2.

Judging by <a href="http://www.wintellect.com/cs/blogs/jeffreyr/archive/2012/10/19/what-s-new-in-clr-via-c-4th-edition-as-compared-to-the-3rd-edition.aspx">this article,</a> Richter himself is not talking about big changes (because there are very few by definition): New asynchronous features of C # 5.0, as well as a new Reflection API, details of the changes in which can be read <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/dotnet/archive/2012/08/28/evolving-the-reflection-api.aspx">here</a> . <br>  In general, how will you prepare for the next interview and decide to update your knowledge, then you can take this latest edition right away. <br>  <b>Release date</b> : December 3, 2012 <br>  <b>Links</b> : <a href="http://www.amazon.com/CLR-via-C-Jeffrey-Richter/dp/0735667454/ref%3Dsr_1_2%3Fie%3DUTF8%26amp%3Bqid%3D1352652545%26amp%3Bsr%3D8-2%26amp%3Bkeywords%3Dclr%2Bvia%2BC%2523">amazon.com</a>

Programming F # 3.0 by Chris Smith </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/888/4d4/183/8884d41836a8f6e473cc5e2c8e8e781f.jpg"><br>  Anyone interested in functional programming on the .NET platform may find it interesting that Chris Smith, after leaving Microsoft, did not abandon book-writing and decided to release a new edition of his book.  The main features of the F # 3.0 language are type providers, and this is the most noticeable change from the previous edition. <br>  In any case, Chris's book is one of the most intelligent books on the F # language in the market, so if you decide to study it, feel free to pay attention to this book. <br>  ZY  I reviewed the translation of the first edition and I hope to continue this lesson for the new edition.  If I have the details regarding the translation of this edition, I will definitely inform you. <br>  <b>Links</b> : <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Programming-F-3-0-Chris-Smith/dp/1449320295/ref%3Dsr_1_2%3Fs%3Dbooks%26amp%3Bie%3DUTF8%26amp%3Bqid%3D1352744571%26amp%3Bsr%3D1-2%26amp%3Bkeywords%3Dprogramming%2BF%2523">amazon.com</a> , <a href="http://sergeyteplyakov.blogspot.com/2010/12/f.html">review of the first edition</a> <br><br><h5>  4. Essential C # 5.0 by Mark Michaelis and Eric Lippert! </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/fd0/3e1/83b/fd03e183b8690b4190ac82f1cc0e3cab.jpg"><br>  Yes, everything is correct, the very same Eric Lippert, the author of the famous blog <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ericlippert/">‚ÄúFabulous Adventures in Coding‚Äù</a> (which I temporarily scored for translation, litter) has ceased to be a reviewer of the book, and co-authored it!  I, frankly, do not know very closely with previous editions of this book, but judging by the reviews and content, as well as the number of reviewers, the book is well worth it to pay attention to. <br>  Before you take on this book, you need to clearly understand its target audience: this is a classic textbook on the C # language, similar to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/C-5-0-Nutshell-Definitive-Reference/dp/1449320104/ref%3Dsr_1_1%3Fs%3Dbooks%26amp%3Bie%3DUTF8%26amp%3Bqid%3D1352821976%26amp%3Bsr%3D1-1%26amp%3Bkeywords%3DC%2523%2Balbahari">Albahari</a> or <a href="http://sergeyteplyakov.blogspot.com/2011/04/c-4-unleashed.html">Bart de Smet‚Äôs</a> book, which covers all the possibilities of the language, literally from ‚ÄúA‚Äù to ‚ÄúI‚Äù.  And if you have recently mastered one such textbook, then there is no particular reason to switch to another.  But if the place of the textbook on the C # language is free for you, then this book is quite suitable for it. <br>  <strong>Release date</strong> : December 10, 2012 <br>  <strong>Links</strong> : <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Essential-Edition-Microsoft-Windows-Development/dp/0321877586/">amazon.com</a> , <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ericlippert/archive/2012/11/09/it-s-still-essential.aspx">announcement from Eric</a> <br><br><h5>  5. C ++ Programming Language 4th Edition by Bjarne Straustrup </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c16/587/87d/c1658787d86bac0180659828ed0e94d6.jpg"><br>  Surely even .NET developers have noticed recently increased activity around the C ++ language.  It is connected with two points: first, last year a <a href="http://sergeyteplyakov.blogspot.com/2012/05/c-11-faq.html">new standard of C ++ was released</a> , and secondly, old C ++ is back on the line and is the ‚Äúfirst kind language‚Äù for developing applications for the Windows Store. <br>  That is why I think that all those interested in C ++ (of which there should be more) should pay attention to the release of a new edition of the book by Bjarne Straustrup.  As for me, this is one of the most powerful books on software development in general, with a huge concentration of information, both on the C ++ language, and on OOP and other aspects of software development.  If suddenly you will have a couple of free months (or maybe years?), Then I would highly recommend paying attention to this book. <br>  <b>Release date</b> : March 25, 2013 <br>  <b>Links</b> : <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Programming-Language-4th-Edition/dp/0321563840/ref%3Dpd_sim_b_9">amazon.com</a> <br><br><h5>  6.

Therefore, it is not at all surprising that there were simply no books about multi-threaded programming in the context of a language, and not a specific operating system. <br>  This year, the situation has changed with the release of Anthony Williams‚Äôs book entitled ‚ÄúC ++ Concurrency In Action‚Äù.  The author of this book keeps a <a href="http://www.justsoftwaresolutions.co.uk/blog/">blog about multithreading</a> , he is the author of the Just :: Thread library, and also the maintainer of boost :: thread.  In general, the comrade is very, very pumped up in this matter, so if suddenly anyone is interested in such mundane things as a memory model in C ++ 11 and other interesting interesting things about multi-threading programming in C ++, then the best source is simply not to be found. <br>  <b>Books on multithreading (for priming interest)</b> : <br><ol><li>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Java-Concurrency-Practice-Brian-Goetz/dp/0321349601/ref%3Dpd_sim_b_47">Java Concurrency in Practice</a> by Brian Goetz et al. <br></li><li>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Concurrent-Programming-Windows-Joe-Duffy/dp/032143482X/ref%3Dsr_1_2%3Fie%3DUTF8%26amp%3Bqid%3D1352752074%26amp%3Bsr%3D8-2%26amp%3Bkeywords%3Dconcurrent%2Bprogramming">Concurrent Programming on Windows</a> by Joe Duffy <br></li><li>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Windows-via-C-softcover/dp/0735663777/ref%3Dpd_sim_b_30">Windows via C / C ++</a> by Jeffrey Richter <br></li><li>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Programming-POSIX-Threads-David-Butenhof/dp/0201633922/ref%3Dpd_sim_b_43">Programming with POSIX Threads</a> by David R.

His first book ‚ÄúZero Day‚Äù was published last year and, on the whole, was warmly received by the readers.  Personally, <a href="http://sergeyteplyakov.blogspot.com/2011/05/zero-day-novel.html">Mark‚Äôs first book</a> seemed worthy to me, if you don‚Äôt expect too much from a technician‚Äôs book, so I didn‚Äôt regret the time I spent on it. <br>  Apparently, the second book is not worse; therefore, personally, I very much want to get to know her better, after which I will definitely share a more detailed opinion with the respected community. <br>  <strong>Links</strong> : <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Trojan-Horse-Novel-Mark-Russinovich/dp/1250010489/ref%3Dsr_1_1%3Fs%3Dbooks%26amp%3Bie%3DUTF8%26amp%3Bqid%3D1352747452%26amp%3Bsr%3D1-1%26amp%3Bkeywords%3Dtrojan%2Bhorse%2Bmark%2Brussinovich">amazon.com</a> , <a href="http://sergeyteplyakov.blogspot.com/2011/05/zero-day-novel.html">Zero Day Review</a> <br><br>

The good news is that the amazing book of the Albahari brothers on C # was translated into Russian;  Now (November 2012) is the only book on the language C # 5.0, published in Russian.  ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what‚Äù the news is that this book has been published by Williams, whose quality of books, how to say it softer, is not always ‚Äúperfect.‚Äù  Right now there are not even examples of chapters, so it‚Äôs impossible to draw conclusions about how bad everything is. <br>  In any case, this is one of the best books on the C # language, which can be safely considered one of the <a href="http://sergeyteplyakov.blogspot.com/2011/04/cnet.html">classic books on the C # language</a> , and it is not a shame to recommend to your colleagues almost any level. <br>  <strong>Links</strong> : <a href="http://www.williamspublishing.com/Books/978-5-8459-1819-2.html">publisher site</a> , <a href="http://www.amazon.com/5-0-Nutshell-The-Definitive-Reference/dp/1449320104/ref%3Dsr_1_1%3Fie%3DUTF8%26amp%3Bqid%3D1352748336%26amp%3Bsr%3D8-1%26amp%3Bkeywords%3Dalbahari%2BC%2523%2B5.0">amazon.com</a> <br><br><h5>  9.

So it is not at all surprising that the old Brooks decided to return to the design process (the design process) again. <br>  There is very little good literature on design and architecture, and despite the fact that the book did not win the same popularity as the first book of Brooks, nevertheless, it is clearly worth the attention of everyone who is interested in this topic (otherwise everyone wants to be hellish architects and design day and night, but for this reason no one wants to do anything for this). <br>  <strong>Links</strong> : <a href="http://www.williamspublishing.com/Books/978-5-8459-1792-8.html">publisher site</a> , <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Design-Essays-Computer-Scientist/dp/0201362988/ref%3Dsr_1_1%3Fie%3DUTF8%26amp%3Bqid%3D1352748599%26amp%3Bsr%3D8-1%26amp%3Bkeywords%3Dbrooks%2Bdesign%2Bof%2Bdesign">amazon.com</a> <br><br><h5>  10.

The result is a book with a wide variety of tips: from the use of coding idioms and the role of unit testing, to the benefit of learning foreign languages ‚Äã‚Äãfor the self-development of programmers. <br>  Kevin put together an excellent set of tips that would be easy and pleasant to read while sitting on the couch, finding confirmation of his own thoughts and experience, if there is a lot of it.
