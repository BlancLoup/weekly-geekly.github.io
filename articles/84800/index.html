      As for women, the answers to the question <b>‚ÄúWho would you like to see your man?‚Äù</b> Did not surprise us.  The beautiful half still prefers pilots and special units soldiers.  An exception was made only for military engineers who took an honorable third place. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d95/bff/add/d95bffadd2b2f19a2880a2bd11957072.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Then we wondered <b>how men's ideas about the ideal military specialty change</b> depending on the real profession of the respondents. <br>  The absolute record-holder was also the specialty of the sniper.  Employees of the media, sales, IT, marketing and advertising, banks and many other industries dream of a rifle with a telescopic sight. <br><br>  But this is not the most interesting. <br>  Curious was the fact that many modern men in the event of war are ready for the benefit of the armed forces to use their existing skills and <b>make their current military specialty</b> . <br><br>  For example, educators and trainings are not against becoming intelligence officers, and representatives of the logistics sphere are ready to go to the partisans. <br>  So there is a reason to take a fresh look at your colleague in the office. <br><table><tbody><tr><th>  Industry </th><th>  The most frequent choice </th></tr><tr><td>  FMCG </td><td>  Sniper </td></tr><tr><td>  IT / Internet </td><td>  Sniper </td></tr><tr><td>  Banking, Finance, Insurance </td><td>  Sniper </td></tr><tr><td>  Marketing, advertising, branding </td><td>  Sniper </td></tr><tr><td>  Production </td><td>  Military engineer </td></tr><tr><td>  Restaurant and hotel business </td><td>  Space business </td></tr><tr><td>  Retail chains </td><td>  Sniper </td></tr><tr><td>  Construction and real estate </td><td>  Military engineer </td></tr><tr><td>  Telecommunications and communication </td><td>  Military engineer </td></tr><tr><td>  Transport, logistics </td><td>  Partizan / Sniper / Paratrooper </td></tr><tr><td>  Personnel Management </td><td>  Sniper </td></tr><tr><td>  Services for business </td><td>  Sniper </td></tr><tr><td>  Public services </td><td>  Sniper </td></tr><tr><td>  Jurisprudence </td><td>  Sniper </td></tr><tr><td>  Car business </td><td>  Sniper </td></tr><tr><td>  Wholesale </td><td>  Sniper </td></tr><tr><td>  Extraction and processing of raw materials </td><td>  Military Engineer / Sniper </td></tr><tr><td>  Education / training </td><td>  Scout / Military Engineer </td></tr><tr><td>  Sports clubs / fitness </td><td>  Paratrooper </td></tr><tr><td>  Diversified holding </td><td>  Sniper </td></tr><tr><td>  The medicine </td><td>  Scout </td></tr><tr><td>  Media, media </td><td>  Sniper </td></tr></tbody></table><br>  Among the free answers to the question who would you like to become, if you had to defend the Motherland, the answers were received: <br>  * admin in any troops <br>  * I will plump <br>  * Universal Evil <br>  * Governor.  The war will ever end and the economic activities of the region should be supported and developed at any time ... <br>  * chief of food and clothing service regiment <br>  * strategic missile forces, that I, fool chtoli, on the front to fight? <br><br>  When analyzing the geographical distribution of answers, it turned out that the <b>dreams of the capital and the regions of Russia</b> do not differ much. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7d1/7fc/32c/7d17fc32cf8170e1ddec9f13e61ca3a3.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1ab/792/c90/1ab792c907e580dc90f71c071cf36075.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  We found it interesting that, despite the fact that representatives of the cultural capital of Russia often dream of serving in the navy, their beautiful half most want to see them in the sky: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/fe6/9c4/d61/fe69c4d61bdaec414e488d81a02dac80.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  And finally, we learned <b>how the ideas about the popularity of this or that military specialty correspond to the real state of affairs</b> . <br>  It turned out that the favorite specialties of the sniper, pilot and engineer in reality are not so popular in the army, and conscripts have to defend their homeland in the less popular quality of border guards, artillerymen and doctors. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1de/09d/b28/1de09db28fdbce0eccbe84c758786b13.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>PS:</b> And it turned out that 6% of the respondents served as partisans =) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/84800/">https://habr.com/ru/post/84800/</a></p>
