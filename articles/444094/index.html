      Experts at Boston University have <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90316833/scientists-have-discovered-a-shape-that-blocks-all-sound-even-your-co-workers">proposed a</a> "breathable" plastic ring that blocks up to 94% of the noise.  He was called the "acoustic <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259C%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB">metamaterial</a> ". <br><br>  The principle of the metamaterial is based on <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A0%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B7%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D1%2581_%25D0%25A4%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE">Fano resonance</a> .  When two waves interfere, their energy is distributed asymmetrically.  As a result, at one point in space, the sound pressure rises to maximum values, and at another, it drops to almost zero. <br><br>  This distribution of acoustic waves by researchers from Boston University was achieved using a special form of metamaterial - inside the ring <a href="https://sci-hub.tw/10.1103/PhysRevB.99.024302">there is a</a> spiral channel through which sound passes.  Acoustic waves in this channel are reflected from the walls, come into Fano resonance and calm down. <br><br>  The authors of the technology developed a prototype device, which was printed on a 3D printer and installed on a PVC pipe, at the other end of which a speaker was located.  And although the end of the pipe with the ring remained more than half open, the sound passing through it became noticeably quieter - in action you can see it in this <a href="https://youtu.be/Fd1D42dVxS0">video</a> : <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Fd1D42dVxS0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><h2>  Advantages and disadvantages </h2><br>  One of the advantages of the technology is the variety of possible ‚Äúsilencer‚Äù forms.  According <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2019-03/bu-brd030619.php">to the</a> authors of the study, they were able to model noise absorbing nozzles with square and hexagonal cross sections - material of this form is proposed to be used as building blocks for soundproof partitions. <br><br>  The second advantage is low cost.  The device can be made of any plastic, and it does not require special expensive materials.  For example, the authors of the technology used to create prototypes standard for 3D printers, <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2590%25D0%2591%25D0%25A1-%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA">ABS plastic</a> and <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25AD%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BA%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D1%2581%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0">epoxy resin</a> . <br><br>  But the invention has an obvious disadvantage - the need for individual calculation.  Each device is designed for specific frequencies and sizes, so massively create universal rings will not work. <br><br><h2>  Analogs of the Invention </h2><br>  The direction of acoustic metamaterials has been evolving for several years.  And work in this area, not only researchers from Boston.  As an analogue, you can bring the device engineers from France - in 2016 they <a href="https://phys.org/news/2016-09-acoustic-metamaterial-panel-absorbs-low-frequency.html">created a</a> panel with a thickness of 1 cm, blocking low frequencies.  Usually for suppressing low frequencies, panels up to 10 cm thick <a href="http://www.un-s.ru/zvukoizol_niz_chastot.html">are required</a> . <br><br>  The French invention <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.99.024302">consists</a> of rows of small Helmholtz <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A0%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B7%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D1%2581_%25D0%2593%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D1%2586%25D0%25B0">resonator</a> chambers that muffle the passing sounds.  According to the authors of the solution, it can be used for sound insulation in buildings and transport - the panels take up little space and weigh a little, but at the same time block almost 100% of the sounds. <br><br>  Another acoustic metamaterial was <a href="https://www.rdmag.com/article/2018/04/new-metamaterial-blocks-out-sound">developed</a> at the University of Southern California.  It is a lattice structure of plastic with iron particles, created using a 3D printer.  Under the influence of a magnetic field, these particles move, which changes the structure of the material and its acoustic characteristics. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/bj/w-/jt/bjw-jta0smc1o4xwtxop6bahurm.jpeg"><br>  <font color="#A9A9A9"><i>Photo by <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/kohrogi/16217519736/">Shunichi kouroki</a> / <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/">CC BY</a></i></font> <br><br><h2>  findings </h2><br>  It is believed that developments in the field of acoustic metamaterials will expand the possible scope of sound insulation.
