And they <a href="https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/response/ale-chief-white-house-beer-recipe">shared it</a> .  All that needed to be done to do this was simply to ask, and <a href="https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/release-recipe-honey-ale-home-brewed-white-house/XkpkYwc0">12,240</a> people did this by taking part in the petition program of the White House <a href="https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/">‚ÄúWe are the People‚Äù</a> . <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Launched in September 2011, the petitioning system allows users to create petitions about everything that comes to their mind (it is quite obvious that petitions on the site still undergo a tough moderation).  Further, after receiving the initial 150 signatures, petitions are published on the site.  And if, over the next 30 days, the petition scored enough signatures, the White House will officially respond to it. <br><br>  But there is one problem: the petition system has become too popular.  The initial limit of 5,000 signatures was too easy to type and in October 2011 it was raised five times to 25,000. But on January 15, 2013, the White House again raised the lower limit to <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2013/01/15/why-we-re-raising-signature-threshold-we-people">100,000</a> so that only the most popular ideas could rise in the rankings.  Now there is already a <a href="https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/revoke-their-increase-number-petition-signatures-required-response-25000-100000/sWlQ0q0B">petition</a> to cancel this decision ( <i>at the time of writing the translation there were 6,732 signatures</i> ), someone else asked the administration <a href="https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/get-rid-petitionswhitehousegov/DLBvj7Vh">to stop this whole circus</a> with the project ( <i>at the time of writing the translation there were 1,000 signatures</i> ), another <a href="https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/actually-take-these-petitions-seriously-instead-just-using-them-excuse-pretend-you-are-listening/grQ9mNkN">asks the</a> White House to take petitions more serious ( Signatures: 37000+. To which the answer was received: <a href="https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/response/were-listening-seriously">We are listening to you. Seriously.</a> ). <br><br>  <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2013/01/15/why-we-re-raising-signature-threshold-we-people">Since September 2011</a> , about 10 million signatures have been put under more than 141,000 petitions created.  In the last two months of 2011, 73,000 new petitions have been created and 2.4 million people have registered in the system.

      As of January 24, more than 285 petitions are awaiting signatures.  And the most popular petition today is the <a href="https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/legally-recognize-westboro-baptist-church-hate-group/DYf3pH2d">request</a> for recognition of discriminatory actions by the Baptist Church of Westborough and its inclusion in the ‚ÄúList of Hate Groups‚Äù (signatures: 325000+).  Most petitions are submitted with requests for forms of taxation, control over firearms, or even completely banning firearms, as well as pardoning prisoners.  But among all this multitude of incoming petitions, there are those that are related to science and technology. <br><br>  For example, a <a href="https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/secure-resources-and-funding-and-begin-construction-death-star-2016/wlfKzFkN">petition</a> asking the administration to consider building the Death Star, which was subscribed to by 34,435 people and received a well-known answer - the official "No" in the Jedi spirit. <br><br>  Below are the other, collected by us, petitions on topics related to science.  And of course, including the recipe for homemade beer from the White House.  Because there is one more thing that we love in our editorial department ( <a href="http://www.wired.com/wiredscience">Wired Science</a> ) as well as science - this is beer. <br><br><h4>  White House Home Brew </h4><br>  Ale for the chef: <a href="https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/response/ale-chief-white-house-beer-recipe">recipes for</a> honey ale and honey porter.

The petition also claims that at present technologies allow the construction of the first generation Enterprise-like starship to begin, and the author modestly advises the White House to delegate to NASA to conduct feasibility and project studies on this issue.  Despite the fact that it will take about 20 years, the result would be amazing travels, and we hope to manage to avoid <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0708480">Tribbles</a> ( <i>asexual nude fluffies, breeding with great speed, flooded the spacecraft - comment of the translator)</i> . <br><br>  Note: The petition was withdrawn from consideration after revealing the fact of signing signatures by the required date.

See, the set of scientific data that I collected as a scientist actually shows that the Earth is really young.  I do not believe that the Earth is more than 9000 years old.  I believe that it was created in six days, as we know ( <i>note: the speech was made in the Baptist church</i> ).  This is what the Bible says.

And he continued: ‚ÄúThe set of scientific data that I collected as a scientist [Brown has a doctoral degree] actually shows that the Earth is really young.

In 1958, Congress created the committee's predecessor, the House of Science and Astronautics Committee, after the Soviets launched Sputnik-1.  One of the first decisions of the committee was the creation of NASA.  Over the years, the scope of the areas of the committee has expanded to include ecology, alternative energy sources, meteorology and atomic research programs. <br><br><h4>  Get rid of pounds </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a75/201/96c/a7520196c01cf66f194fbd1ccd87fda8.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Signatures under the petition: ~ 35400. <br>  The British Imperial Metric System, in which everything is measured in feet, miles, pounds, gallons, etc.  - too chaotic and confusing, according to a <a href="https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/make-metric-system-standard-united-states-instead-imperial-system/FndsKXLh">petition filed in December</a> .  ‚ÄúWe [the United States] still persistently adhere to the use of an inaccurate Imperial System, despite the fact that any other country with which we have to interact, uses the Metric,‚Äù the petition says. <br>  But in the Metric system, where the measurements in such units as kilogram, meter, liter, is also not without problems.  And the main thing here is that the standard kilogram is <a href="http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2013/01/keeping-kilogram-constant">not always as standard</a> as it should be. <br>  Or you can consider the issue of adopting the <a href="">Potrzebi</a> system or measure it in <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/trivia/sagans-an-informal-unit-of-measurement-signify-what">Sagans</a> and <a href="http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2009/smoot-0604.html">Smoot</a> . <br><br><h4>  Make a $ 1 Trillion Coin </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/85d/08b/179/85d08b179e677a4541b3c0b2f5874f9e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Signatures under the petition: ~ 11200. <br>  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãminting one platinum coin of 1 trillion dollars "is not more absurd than playing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_football">Political Football</a> , and in general the economy is threatened," the January 3 <a href="https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/direct-united-states-mint-make-single-platinum-trillion-dollar-coin/8hvJbLl6">petition</a> said. <br>  In Wired Science, we decided to approach this proposal from an arithmetic point of view and calculated the cost of a platinum coin with the size of a silver dollar - $ 1,200 came out.  And although this is not considered in the nominal value of the petition, a platinum coin of 1 trillion dollars would be much more and would not fit into the bank, and certainly in your wallet: the weight is almost 43 million pounds, about 80 feet in diameter and 6 feet in thickness. <br><br><h4>  Make a DDoS attack a legal form of protest. </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ded/a21/159/deda2115905eb8dc22d00138c32ec90b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Signatures under the petition: ~ 5600. <br>  <a href="http://paritynews.com/government/item/552-anonymous-files-petition-to-make-ddos-legal-form-of-protest">The</a> <a href="https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/make-distributed-denial-service-ddos-legal-form-protesting/X3drjwZY">petition</a> <a href="http://paritynews.com/government/item/552-anonymous-files-petition-to-make-ddos-legal-form-of-protest">sent by the</a> hacktivist group Anonymous on January 7 asks the White House to decriminalize massive attacks on servers sending web sites to offline.

It is explained that DDoS is not so much an attack as the Internet equivalent of protest actions (sedentary protest or seizure-Occupy).  ‚ÄúInstead of a group of people standing outside the building and seizing the territory, they use their computers to capture a website in order to slow down (or stop) one site or another for a short time,‚Äù says the petition. <br><br><h4>  Remove daylight saving time. </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/538/608/c3f/538608c3fc91f2a1e7b711dc5d6189e5.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Signatures under the petition: ~ 5700. <br>  The transition to summer time, first conceived by Benjamin Franklin, still remains an ‚Äúapple of discord‚Äù.  ‚ÄúEvery year, the spring hour ahead brings clear and obvious performance losses: setting hours, missing meetings, angry-tangled-tired people, stress for parents ...,‚Äù says <a href="https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/end-daylight-savings/Vqmj9z6D">this</a> January 12 petition. <br>  Guys, we do not know what you have there for strange hours, but there are also more convincing arguments "for" and "against" the transfer of arrows.
