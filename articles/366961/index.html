A lot of fans around the world have already seen the teasers of the game before the holes, discussing the details of what they saw on the forums, and a dispute broke out between the followers of the old-school ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù Fallout 1/2 and those who liked wandering through the wasteland in the third part of the game .  But both gamers' camps, like many people who have never played in any Fallout, are united by a craving for beauty ‚Äî a post-apocalypse, a world lying in ruins.  Probably, psychologists will find in the zagashniki a couple of theories explaining why the broad masses are so interested in the topic of a destroyed world in which the remnants of humanity survive.  But let's not do amateur psychoanalysis, but rather on the eve of the release of the new Fallout, we read books and watch films in which the action takes place during the post-apocalypse. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h1>  What to see </h1><br>  Let's start with the most important, according to Ilyich, art - cinema. <br><br><h2>  <a href="https://afisha.mail.ru/cinema/movies/724684_paren_i_ego_pes/">The guy and his dog</a> </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/972/463/105/972463105c4818ba57ff2420f73b4093.jpg" alt="image">

      The oldest movie in our collection.  It is believed that he became one of the sources of inspiration when creating the first game of the Fallout series. <br><br>  After the Fourth World War, very few people remained on the planet.  And they survive as they can.  A young man named Vic wanders in search of food and women, and the dog Blood helps him in this.  It so happened that Blood visited a secret military laboratory and can now communicate telepathically with Vic. <br><br>  The film is based on the <a href="http://www.livelib.ru/book/1000312792">same book</a> . <br><br><h2>  <a href="https://afisha.mail.ru/cinema/movies/646471_zabvenie/">Oblivion</a> </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/fe9/84c/776/fe984c77678ad7b32fbee0619f00fcb6.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Fantastic thriller about the future of mankind.  Earth was attacked, mankind won the war, but failed to save the Earth.  These are the last, stripping team.  But one day the hero finds a woman among the wreckage of a wrecked ship, which casts doubt on the whole habit of things he is used to.  And only the key, hidden in the memories, is able to regenerate it.  "Oblivion" is the second feature film directed by Joseph Kosinski, famous for his film "Tron: Heritage." <br><br><h2>  <a href="https://afisha.mail.ru/cinema/movies/418654_ja__legenda/">I'm a legend</a> </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/df3/919/dc8/df3919dc81c1adf74e98bdd15057c7eb.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In the near future, scientists have found a cure for cancer, but they miscalculated: after testing, 99% of the population turned into infectious mutant ghouls.  Dr. Robert Neville entered the percentage of healthy people.  In the afternoon, he walks through empty New York, picturesquely overgrown with weeds, in the company of faithful Samantha (Abby German Shepherd Dog), hunts antelope and sets traps for those infected.  And at night, having barricaded himself in a mansion, he is trying to develop a vaccine and send messages on the air to a possible survivor.  So far to no avail ... <br><br><h2>  <a href="https://afisha.mail.ru/cinema/movies/721111_vodnyj_mir/">Water world</a> </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ca6/b97/01e/ca6b9701ed470f025050f7bca600dd4b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In the future, the polar ice melted, and almost the entire planet was under water.  Legends of a pristine piece of land suitable for life began to circulate around the world, but no one could find this place.  The protagonist of the film, an honest sailor, travels along the water surface with three buildings, meeting different people on its way.  All the inhabitants of the water world are wary of insidious bandits, called "smokers" - because they move in motorboats.  They rob ordinary navigators and do not stop at anything in search of long-awaited sushi.  The main thing that is appreciated in the new world is soil, terrestrial plants and fresh water, suitable for drinking. <br><br><h2>  <a href="https://afisha.mail.ru/cinema/movies/721506_pochtalon/">Postman</a> </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/dca/8e9/86b/dca8e986b2b1f2534787c950388a9ce8.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Events unfold in 2013 (yes, an old film - was released in rent in 1997).  It took several decades after nuclear war and the subsequent collapse of civilization.  In the post-apocalyptic desert, a lone nomad travels on a mule.  In order not to die of thirst and hunger, he plays in front of a few residents the performances of Shakespeare for a couple with a four-legged friend.  In the meantime, a gang of neo-fascists, led by a stern general Bethlehem, are operating in the district.  They regularly collect tribute from the surrounding villages - take valuable things, recruit recruits.  One of these recruits is the notorious nomad.  Not wanting to serve the so-called holistam, the hero escapes.  He finds a wagon with the corpse of a postman, puts on his uniform and goes on, posing as the deceased and swearing to the postal service. <br><br><h2>  <a href="https://afisha.mail.ru/cinema/movies/711814_sudnii_den/">Judgment Day</a> </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d8c/1d7/d8c/d8c1d7d8c8791bdc9f8c8a347b191664.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  After the universal catastrophe, the Earth turned into a scorched desert.  On the endless roads, teeming with gangs, fighting with each other for food, wander five.  Hoping to find peace, they stop at a house that turns into a trap.  Can someone get out alive? <br><br><h2>  <a href="https://afisha.mail.ru/cinema/movies/581872_doroga/">Road</a> </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ea6/20b/c73/ea620bc73d191f211bca604a224b4dc6.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The land is in agony - after a series of disasters, states and cities were destroyed, all plants and animals died.  Survivors feed on preserved canned food and other people.  Father and son go to the coast along a road strewn with ashes, in the hope that life is still there.  On the way they face many challenges and dangers.  But hope helps to overcome all the trials. <br><br>  The film is based on the novel by Cormac McCarthy, the author of ‚ÄúOld Men‚Äù.  The book is wonderful, and we recommend reading it too! <br><br><h2>  <a href="https://afisha.mail.ru/cinema/movies/522105_kniga_ilaya/">Eli's book</a> </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/74c/5e1/45e/74c5e145e2e172d21eaac0535c2ae727.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The lone hero Eli is one of the few who survived a nuclear disaster that shook the world.  He wanders through the inhospitable deserted cities, changes all the money for water - the main value of the new world, and does not part with the mysterious book, which he likes to re-read in dull evenings.  Unfortunately, Eli catches the eye of a certain Carnegie, the ‚Äúmayor‚Äù of one of the towns and the head of gangster-marauders, who is overly interested in his book.  To lure her from Eli, Carnegie sends a beautiful woman, Solara, to him, but the girl begins to feel warm feelings for the guest and goes with him to the desert. <br><br><h2>  <a href="https://afisha.mail.ru/cinema/movies/754388_bezumnii_maks_4/">Mad Max: Fury Road</a> </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/510/03b/d87/51003bd8768277b9f64c72929c303e1b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Max is haunted by his own past, and he believes that the best way to survive is to wander all alone and stay away from everyone.  Sweeping away everything in its path, it is picked up by the fugitives racing through the desert in the fighting wagon of the Furyosa warrior.  They are saved from the Citadel, where only cruelty and vice reign, reigned in the cult by the tyranny of the Non-Death Joe.  In the insane and irrepressible rage, Joe, from whom something priceless was stolen, gathers all his troops and mercilessly pursues the rebels along the merciless Road of War. <br><br><h2>  Phoenix 9 </h2><br>  And finally - a post-apocalyptic short film.  Nuclear war, the world is destroyed, famine, epidemics, desertification of land, the climate goes to hell.  The seven survivors walk across America from one coast to another to find the colony least affected by the disaster.  Once they find a temporary shelter in a destroyed building, and make an unexpected discovery ... <br><br><iframe src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://player.vimeo.com/video/111296890&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgeD9-oq6m7pYYsQNbiqTuYMvEgPw" width="560" height="235" frameborder="0" title="Phoenix 9 - A sci-fi short film" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/10a/5d5/6a1/10a5d56a13f0fb9af706311d23f97d48.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <sup>Modern versions of the four Horsemen of the Apocalypse.</sup> <br><br><h1>  What to read </h1><br>  Cinema is a good thing, but do not neglect the literature.  According to Fallout, they never made a single film, and only one book was written ‚Äúbased on‚Äù - ‚ÄúThe <a href="http://www.livelib.ru/book/1000522489">Hand of the Enclave</a> ‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/631/1f6/3b5/6311f63b502cdadce1df5c3780c7deba.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  But the world literature can offer many other post-apocalyptic stories. <br><br><h2>  <a href="http://www.livelib.ru/book/1000306890">Lucifer Hammer</a> </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2e7/7cc/173/2e77cc1736c790782463c4cbe214a10b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The earth was bombarded by numerous fragments of a disintegrating comet, which led to horrific consequences.  But it seemed little to the people: the war between Russia and China began, the level of the world ocean rose, the coastal zones devastated the tsunami - in short, everything that could have happened.  Naturally, few survived.  A gang of cannibals arose, opposed by a small group of people who retain the remnants of civilization. <br><br><h2>  <a href="http://www.livelib.ru/book/1000253362">Malville</a> </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f13/03c/5f4/f1303c5f4493ef7f1a2e74a9dfb0b424.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  A group of people who survived a global nuclear catastrophe hid in an old castle.  They had to create a primitive agrarian-feudal society. <br><br><h2>  <a href="http://www.livelib.ru/book/1001265265">Deviation from the norm</a> </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/15f/54a/2c1/15f54a2c1dfad5cce8b9a41769c2f19c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The book is about a handful of descendants of those who survived after the Third World War.  The pieces of information that have come down to them, they formed the basis of their community. <br><br><h2>  <a href="http://www.livelib.ru/book/1000753936">Living people</a> </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/566/80f/86e/56680f86e383f58d08ac2986de06ab91.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The world after the disaster is not only deserts and ruins of cities.  This is, first of all, the lack of everything that is needed for survival: food, drinking water, medicines, heat, housing, security.  And survival depends not only on the needs of the body, but also on the relationship between people who by chance ended up in a harsh environment with each other. <br><br><h1>  miscellanea </h1><br>  What fan of Fallout didn‚Äôt dream of getting an analogue of the Pip-Boy mini-computer?  Actually, especially hardcore fans collect very diverse versions of the device (examples: <a href="https://www.vg247.com/2015/07/01/fallout-super-fan-makes-his-own-real-life-pip-boy-replica/">one</a> , <a href="http://www.giantfreakinrobot.com/scifi/ideal-gift-fallout-fan-working-pipboy-3000-replica.html">two</a> , <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2011/09/03/homemade-pip-boy-3000-does-almost-everything/">three</a> ).  But the pleasure is not practical.  But now you can put on the smartphone or tablet the official companion application released by Bethesda on the eve of the fourth version of the game.  With it, you can watch your game statistics, inventory, study world maps, as well as play embedded mini-games. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bde/722/b96/bde722b961a24e8ab9db1d11f3de12a1.jpg"></div><br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9af/f6e/2f9/9aff6e2f954f46a392d749043116a747.jpg"></div><br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/edd/dfd/b98/edddfdb9807a4dfc8c04a420854ba5e2.jpg"></div><br><br><h2>  <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.bethsoft.falloutcompanionapp">Android</a> |  <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fallout-pip-boy/id1049061806%3Fmt%3D8">iOS</a> </h2><br>  Lovers of collection models will soon be able to replenish their collections with a smart attack aircraft with a full parade, on a <a href="http://www.toyark.com/threezero-fallout-4-a-167919/">1/6 scale</a> : <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b99/7bc/ea4/b997bcea4c6940f2ab4754600dda65ce.jpg"></div><br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a3b/2ea/209/a3b2ea209bfd407f904f72b6050f6dea.jpg"></div><br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/893/ec5/4a3/893ec54a3f414ab6b4ddd340a4237377.jpg"></div><br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6f2/4a4/059/6f24a4059dc6402c97a5a611db91d6da.jpg"></div><br><br>  Get ready, soon have to leave the shelter.
