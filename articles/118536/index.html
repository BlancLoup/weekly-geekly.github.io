Why and for whom?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  This is the first part of the review where we will examine the basic concepts and principles of the work of interactive boards. <br>  Interactive boards are increasingly used in our lives.  They stand in offices, they are engaged in schools, they become a good tool for transmitting and perceiving information.  What is the interactive board, how it works, what they are and whether they are needed in Russian schools, which questions I would like to answer in this review. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/de7/2dd/3a3/de72dd3a3f08fb1e0b719ad5bca3141b.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Recently, news about the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/hardware/111567/">new development of LG</a> was published where the company presented a ‚Äúschool board of the future‚Äù, various comments appeared in the comments, some said that ‚Äú... all the most eminent scientists in the largest universities in the west create flowcharts and describe the equations in chalk on an ordinary board .. . "and the emergence of such innovations leads to dullness of children, while others believed that it was a new impetus to the development of education, now it‚Äôs not possible to explain on the fingers how electrons move around the nucleus, but clearly show on video or 3D models that  Once again, it will interest children and draw their attention to the academic process.  Well, we will understand. <br><br>  And so what is an interactive whiteboard is nothing more than just a huge touch panel on which with the help of a projector an image of the desktop is projected from a connected computer. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a31/b48/1c9/a31b481c94166d26fba6d81f72d9de49.jpg">

      Boards with this type of installation are called ‚Äúdirect projection boards‚Äù due to the fact that the projector is installed directly in front of the panel, or suspended from the ceiling.  This type of board is the easiest and cheapest, which is important, but it has a significant disadvantage when you use it, you have to stand sideways to the board so as not to block the projected image, which is not always convenient <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ec8/d4e/64b/ec8d4e64baa9a6882a3c0ccb7a694bed.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  This drawback is deprived of the rear projection board where the projector is located behind the touch screen, and the speaker, approaching the screen, does not block the luminous flux of the projector, which is very convenient in operation.  In addition, the bright light of the projector does not enter the eyes of the speaker. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/af0/2e2/efb/af02e2efbf1fad5fc41b9e0e34797b63.jpg"><br><br>  Stationary boards are built into the walls or into special structures, the mobile kit does not require additional construction, its design includes a system of mirrors that allows for a compact mobile device.  But the weight of the structure, of course, corresponds to ~ 200 kg, with the weight of an ordinary board in the region of 40 kg. <br> <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/5cm_cRd9WgANxSdtoX6FHQ%3Ffeat%3Dembedwebsite"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b06/dad/744/b06dad7449e003400a49beba1fed61c4.jpg" height="480" width="640"></a> <br><br>  It should be said that interactive boards are made using various technologies for determining the position of a marker or a finger on the surface.  Now there are: Sensory resistive, optical, infrared, ultrasonic, electromagnetic technology. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Sensory resistive technology is used in interactive boards, the surface of which consists of two layers, between which the sensors are located.  When you press any object (or finger) on the top layer of the working surface of the board, the sensors determine the place of contact and transfer information to the computer. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Optical technology used in interactive whiteboards, also allows you to work with the board in any subject.  Infrared sensors ‚Äúsee‚Äù an object that is brought close enough to the surface of the board, determine its coordinates and transmit to a computer. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Infrared and ultrasound technology allows you to work with the board only with a special marker.  When the surface is touched, the marker emits an ultrasonic and infrared signal, which is fixed by sensors in the frame of the board. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Electromagnetic technology also implies the use of a special marker with an interactive whiteboard.  Its position is determined by sensors in the surface of the board.  The same technology is used in wireless tablets, as well as in interactive panels that replace a computer monitor. <br><br> <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/xsFB2GG3IcKdhUCBb48Exw%3Ffeat%3Dembedwebsite"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4c9/8ba/bcd/4c98babcd62983e7a854baaf8ec2af71.jpg" height="640" width="640"></a> <br>  those markers <br> <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/5vA26WQRSG5E8GRUrP6XKg%3Ffeat%3Dembedwebsite"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b09/5ca/c3e/b095cac3ea0d1184f390b904aa255e99.jpg" height="640" width="640"></a> <br>  and they are in action <br><br>  All of these technologies can be divided into 2 conditional subgroups of boards that can be operated by hand or for boards that require a special ‚Äúmarker‚Äù <br>  Each of them has its main advantages for one is the speed and ease of control without additional priblud, on the other it is easier to do the construction and all the operations associated with the accuracy of determining touch. <br><br>  So when choosing an ID, you need to decide on the following questions: <br>  - How often and in what capacity will the interactive board be used? <br>  If an ID is often written, it makes sense to buy an ID on which you can write not only in the ‚Äúwhite‚Äù board mode, but also with an ordinary marker in the off state.  If presentations are planned with written additions, or using drawing programs, for example, PAINT, then a hard-surfaced electromagnetic board is better suited for this purpose. <br><br>  - Do you need a mobile or fixed board? <br>  Your choice depends on the purpose of using the ID <br><br>  - Do you need companion ID devices? <br>  These are, for example, remote controls that are used in surveys, surveys, or testing using an ID.  Such consoles can be supplied with the board or sold separately. <br><br>  - What software ID do you need? <br>  Each ID is equipped with software, only some include only the most basic utilities, and some have additional software, for example, multimedia software ‚Äî libraries, encyclopedias, trainers, developmental flash games, etc. <br><br><br>  Of course, this is not all the questions that should be guided when choosing an interactive whiteboard.  You should consider the conditions of warranty and repair in the event of a malfunction of the ID, take care of the availability of Russian instructions, familiarize yourself with the functionality of the interactive whiteboard and the simplicity of its development, and, of course, do not forget about the price. <br><br>  The most important advice: do not rush to buy the first available interactive equipment just because it is called the ‚Äúinteractive whiteboard‚Äù.  It is best to consult with a specialist, visit online forums where different types of boards are discussed, get acquainted with products from different manufacturers. <br><br>  <i>In the second part of the review there is the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa SmartBoard vs ActivBoard duel from the different categories of SmartBoard Sensory (without manipulators) and ActivBoard Electromagnetic (marker), so suggest what parameters they can be tested and the methods of these tests ;-)</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/118536/">https://habr.com/ru/post/118536/</a></p>
