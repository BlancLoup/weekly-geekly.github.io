  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Swedes are going to arrest the head of WikiLeaks</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Today it became known that the Swedish law enforcement authorities resumed the case of Julian Essenge, the project manager of WikiLeaks, who in this country is accused of rape (yes, it is in the plural) and harassment.  The situation is all the more interesting because the Swedes seem to have decided to drop all charges against Essenge, after which he left the country.  And now it all started anew, but Essendzha is no longer in Sweden.  He went to seek political asylum in Switzerland, known for its broad views on such matters.  True, Sweden seems to be also a rather liberal country, but apparently this is as long as the case does not concern the United States and local warriors. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  In general, it is difficult to imagine how someone who is as famous as Essenge, trying to avoid political persecution, comes to another country to live a normal life, working for the good of society (well, or for his own benefit, there are several alternative opinions about WikiLeaks).  And suddenly this man starts for no reason at all begins to rape the citizens of the country where he came to live and work.  Of course, something like this can be expected from Mike Tyson, but certainly not from Essenge.  Naturally, there is a possibility that all this is true (who can vouch for one hundred percent for someone?), Then this probability is vanishingly small.  After all, US representatives are just waiting for the right moment to discredit the ‚Äúenemy No. 1‚Äù of the American nation, as some Pentagon representative recently called it.  And then suddenly the ‚Äúenemy‚Äù itself begins to compromise itself. <br><br>  In general, Sweden seemed to understand this, too, and admitted that their attempts to accuse Essenge were groundless, but as soon as he left the country, a new legal process began immediately.  Now the Swedish authorities want to receive an international arrest warrant for the head of WikiLeaks.  He has already said that all this is pure provocation and a discredit of the project itself and its management.

      Probably, the United States really put pressure on the right people in Sweden, who started up the Essenge case again.  Let's hope that in Switzerland they will not think of something else.  In principle, you can come up with something like ‚ÄúEssendzh provided information about the degree of protection of US nuclear facilities to Iran‚Äù - you can also do some good work ... We are waiting for the development of events. <br><br>  Via <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-11785281">bbc</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/108412/">https://habr.com/ru/post/108412/</a></p>
