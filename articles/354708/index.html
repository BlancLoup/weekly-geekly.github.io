  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Transparent HTTPS proxy to bypass Roskomnadzor‚Äôs locks</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hi, habrovchane!  I think many have recently encountered problems of access to the necessary resources because of the <s>shame of</s> Roskom‚Äôs supervision of blocking Telegrams.  And I think there are no comments here.  The fact is that these resources are not to blame for anything, but they are blocked.  Problems arose with Viber, ReCaptcha, GoogleFonts, Youtube and others (except the telegraph itself).  It happened in my organization, and we need some innocent services like air.  At some time, everything was decided by using proxy servers, but they were unstable or completely disconnected (they were also blocked by our great and mighty RKN). <br><br>  After reading a bunch of articles, I got the idea to teach Squid to start up separate URLs via Tor.  Whether to use this method, you decide.  But I will say that after the implementation, all the problems that existed before have disappeared.  Who cares, go under the cat. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Why is this?</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  The article is written solely for the purpose of helping those who wrongfully suffer from the total nonsense that is happening in our country.  It is also aimed at those who need exactly ‚Äútransparent‚Äù Squid with HTTPS without certificate substitution and the ability to track visits both via HTTP and HTTPS, since the article is essentially a continuation of <a href="https://habr.com/post/267851/">another</a> article of <a href="https://habr.com/post/267851/">mine</a> , because here I propose a fix for a long-standing bug that did not allow to see https resources in the logs and did not allow using newer versions of Squid.  Well, and also just for those who are interested in using Squid. <br></div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">What are the benefits?</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><ul><li>  Unlimited scaling options </li><li>  Relative ease of support and administration </li><li>  If this is important, then you can provide anonymous access to the resources listed in the list (although this is not the topic of the article, anonymity is provided by the ‚Äúmess‚Äù </li><li>  Stability.  If you use several Tor services (different config files), you can connect them to Squid, and get a round robin. </li><li>  Absolute free.  Forever and ever. </li></ul><br></div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">I don't know anything, Squid \ Tor is slow, I will go and pick up a VPS with VPN over the hill</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Congratulations!  You really decided that Roskomnadzor caused you inconvenience, and you still have to pay for it to get out of the situation?  OK.  Feel free to skip the article, and raise VPN tunnels.  By the way, VPN is successfully blocked.  Easy.  And in the light of recent events, I will tell you that soon no one will be able to use VPS to bypass locks at the level of the law.  And plus to everything, your VPS can also be locked into the lock "simply because there is a telegram sitting next to it."  Tor won't block, no way.  If you configure it with obfs, then never anywhere (subject, perhaps, for a separate article, since this obfs is not considered).  And how much will you need to raise such VPS with VPN?  How to serve it?  Here, the solution is easier at times, reliable, and, if desired, quite speedy, and free.  So, before you mislead other readers, please think again about everything + and - VPS with VPN, and only then state that Squid + Tor is a slow, unreliable solution. <br></div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Tor will block!</b>  <b class="spoiler_title">In China, there is already blocked</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Not.  Not.  And again, no.  In China, Tor works with a configured obfs.  It works great.  There is no way to block Tor in the World.  Even China with its capacity, minds and finances could not do it. <br></div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Tor slow!</b>  <b class="spoiler_title">And if you work through obfs, then generally horror!</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Refer to the of.documentation and a bunch of articles on the Internet, which describes how to make the speed was at a decent level.  And again, by setting up several copies of Tor with different configs, you can attach them to Squid and get a round robin. <br></div></div><br>  So first, a little theory.  As we all know, Tor is not an HTTP proxy, it cannot be made a direct peer for the underlying Squid.  It provides SOCKS proxying (of course, not only, but we need just that).  To marry Tor from Squid, we need something that could play the role of a conductor from Tor to Squid and back.  And of course, ladies and gentlemen, this is Privoxy.  Just the same, he is able to be a direct peer, and send everything further to Tor.

      It was, as I said, read a bunch of articles, but none suited me.  I came across <a href="https://yvoinov.blogspot.ru/2015/10/squid-tor-privoxy-transparent-dns.html">this</a> article, but it didn‚Äôt quite fit me either, since I don‚Äôt need a bump.  In general, all available articles, almost all, imply either a bump, or just http, and in my case, you need HTTPS, splice, and transparency.  Also seen <a href="https://www.alexeykopytko.com/2016/tor-transparent-proxy/">this</a> and <a href="https://habr.com/post/336966/">this</a> , but there are very different approaches.  Its pros and cons.  I chose for myself a bunch of Squid + Tor. <br><br>  I already wrote about how to make Squid transparent with HTTPS proxying without certificate substitution.  And of course, I tried to implement the idea on it.  But I was disappointed.  HTTP requests were fine with TOR, but no HTTPS.  The problem is not very well known, and I learned from one of the developers that this is a flaw in older versions of Squid.  But during the experiments, a solution was found - Squid 3.5.27, which fixed this bug + beautiful domain names in the logs (https), instead of ip addresses.  But even here I was waited by several disappointments, which will be discussed below.  But everything, as they say, is finished with a file. <br><br>  So, the source data: <br><br><ol><li>  Debian Stretch (9) x86 (I haven't tried x64) </li><li>  Sorts Squid 3.5.23 from repository </li><li>  Squid from a fresh site </li><li>  Openssl </li><li>  Libecap3 </li><li>  Tor </li><li>  Privoxy </li><li>  Straight arms and lots of coffee with cookies. </li></ol><br>  Build Squid with pens or install ready-made packages (links below), you decide.  If you think that I‚Äôve seen <s>blackjack and w‚Ä¶</s> viruses in them, then compile yourself.  You also need to compile if you have a different distro (if Ubunt, put it).  We will collect the version of Squid 3.5.23, which at the time of writing this article is lying in the <b>Stretch</b> repository, upgrading it to the latest source code 3.5.27 from the offsite site.  Unlike my first article on HTTPS + Squid, we will be compiling without libressl. <br><br>  So prepare for the build: <br><br><pre><code class="bash hljs">apt-get install fakeroot build-essential devscripts apt-get build-dep squid3 apt-get install libecap3 apt-get install libecap3-dev apt-get install libssl1.0-dev apt-get install libgnutls28-dev</code> </pre> <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">IMPORTANT!</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  It is very important to install libssl1.0-dev, and not another version, otherwise Squid will either lag, or fail to build at all due to incomprehensible errors. <br></div></div><br><br>  Next we get the source code for Squid 3.5.23 <br><br><pre> <code class="bash hljs">apt-get <span class="hljs-built_in"><span class="hljs-built_in">source</span></span> squid3</code> </pre><br>  We download this particular archive with Squid sources: <br><br><pre> <code class="bash hljs">wget -O squid-3.5.27-2018.tar.gz http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v3/3.5/squid-3.5.27-20180318-r1330042.tar.gz</code> </pre><br>  Go to the Squid source directory and update the source code to the newly added sorts: <br><br><pre> <code class="bash hljs"><span class="hljs-built_in"><span class="hljs-built_in">cd</span></span> squid3-3.5.23/ uupdate -v 3.5.27-2018 ../squid-3.5.27-2018.tar.gz</code> </pre><br>  Go to the new directory with updated sources: <br><br><pre> <code class="bash hljs"><span class="hljs-built_in"><span class="hljs-built_in">cd</span></span> ../squid3-3.5.27-2018</code> </pre><br>  Add to debian / rules options for compiling: <br><br><pre> <code class="bash hljs">--<span class="hljs-built_in"><span class="hljs-built_in">enable</span></span>-ssl \ --<span class="hljs-built_in"><span class="hljs-built_in">enable</span></span>-ssl-crtd \ --with-openssl</code> </pre> <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">The board</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  You can, by the way, cut down unnecessary options for you, this will speed up the compilation <br></div></div><br>  Next, you need to patch the source code with this patch: <br><br><pre> <code class="bash hljs">&lt;b&gt;client_side_request.patch&lt;/b&gt; --- src/client_side_request.cc Thu Aug 18 00:36:42 2016 +++ src/client_side_request.cc Mon Sep 19 04:41:45 2016 @@ -519,20 +519,10 @@ // note the DNS details <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">for</span></span> the transaction stats. http-&gt;request-&gt;recordLookup(dns); - <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">if</span></span> (ia != NULL &amp;&amp; ia-&gt;count &gt; 0) { - // Is the NAT destination IP <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">in</span></span> DNS? - <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">for</span></span> (int i = 0; i &lt; ia-&gt;count; ++i) { - <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">if</span></span> (clientConn-&gt;local.matchIPAddr(ia-&gt;in_addrs[i]) == 0) { - debugs(85, 3, HERE &lt;&lt; <span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">"validate IP "</span></span> &lt;&lt; clientConn-&gt;<span class="hljs-built_in"><span class="hljs-built_in">local</span></span> &lt;&lt; <span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">" possible from Host:"</span></span>); - http-&gt;request-&gt;flags.hostVerified = <span class="hljs-literal"><span class="hljs-literal">true</span></span>; - http-&gt;doCallouts(); - <span class="hljs-built_in"><span class="hljs-built_in">return</span></span>; - } - debugs(85, 3, HERE &lt;&lt; <span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">"validate IP "</span></span> &lt;&lt; clientConn-&gt;<span class="hljs-built_in"><span class="hljs-built_in">local</span></span> &lt;&lt; <span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">" non-match from Host: IP "</span></span> &lt;&lt; ia-&gt;in_addrs[i]); - } - } - debugs(85, 3, HERE &lt;&lt; <span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">"FAIL: validate IP "</span></span> &lt;&lt; clientConn-&gt;<span class="hljs-built_in"><span class="hljs-built_in">local</span></span> &lt;&lt; <span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">" possible from Host:"</span></span>); - hostHeaderVerifyFailed(<span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">"local IP"</span></span>, <span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">"any domain IP"</span></span>); + debugs(85, 3, HERE &lt;&lt; <span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">"validate IP "</span></span> &lt;&lt; clientConn-&gt;<span class="hljs-built_in"><span class="hljs-built_in">local</span></span> &lt;&lt; <span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">" possible from Host:"</span></span>); + http-&gt;request-&gt;flags.hostVerified = <span class="hljs-literal"><span class="hljs-literal">true</span></span>; + http-&gt;doCallouts(); + <span class="hljs-built_in"><span class="hljs-built_in">return</span></span>; } void</code> </pre><br>  What is it for?  I will explain.  When I wrote the first article about peek and splice, I said that newer versions do not work, and it was like that, and this patch corrects the very problem that Squid selectively tears off HTTPS connections with an interesting By posting to cache.log: <br><br><pre> <code class="bash hljs">SECURITY ALERT: Host header forgery detected on ... (<span class="hljs-built_in"><span class="hljs-built_in">local</span></span> IP does not match any domain IP)</code> </pre> <br>  The fact is that on one host something resolves in one IP, on a neighboring one sometimes in another, on Squid itself in the third, since  There is a DNS cache and it is not updated synchronously.  Squid does not match the ip-domain in its cache (because it updated its cache a little earlier or later) and terminates the connection.  It seems like protection, but nowadays this is considered normal (round-robin DNS).  Developers reinsured.  And we do not need it at all!  To those who say that this patch probably carries a security risk, I will answer that I have consulted on this patch with Yuri Voinov, who is directly related to the Squid development team.  There is no threat here! <br><br>  So, the file for the patch was created, the code was dropped, you need to patch: <br><br><pre> <code class="bash hljs">patch -p0 -i client_side_request.patch</code> </pre><br>  Next, you need to cancel the application of one patch when compiling (otherwise you will receive an error that this patch cannot be applied, since it has already been applied).  Go to <b>debian / patches / series</b> and comment out there <b>0003-SQUID-2018_1.patch</b> , putting a <b>#</b> sign in front of it: <br><br><pre> <code class="bash hljs"><span class="hljs-comment"><span class="hljs-comment">#0003-SQUID-2018_1.patch</span></span></code> </pre><br>  Well, then - compile and build packages! <br><br><pre> <code class="bash hljs">dpkg-buildpackage -us -uc -nc</code> </pre> <br>  Install squid-langpack <br><br><pre> <code class="bash hljs">apt-get install squid-langpack</code> </pre> <br>  and install fresh packages <br><br><pre> <code class="bash hljs">dpkg -i squid-common_3.5.27-2018-1_all.deb dpkg -i squid_3.5.27-2018-1_i386.deb dpkg -i squid3_3.5.27-2018-1_all.deb</code> </pre> <br>  If apt curses dependency, do <br><br><pre> <code class="bash hljs">apt-get -f install</code> </pre><br>  Next, you need to turn off Squid from autoload (by default, the init file is used, Squid complains that the PID file is unavailable) <br><br><pre> <code class="bash hljs">systemctl <span class="hljs-built_in"><span class="hljs-built_in">disable</span></span> squid</code> </pre> <br>  and create a systemd service in the <b>/ etc / systemd / system</b> directory (the service file is in the source code, and completely copied here) <br><br><pre> <code class="bash hljs">cat /etc/systemd/system/squid3.service <span class="hljs-comment"><span class="hljs-comment">## Copyright (C) 1996-2018 The Squid Software Foundation and contributors ## ## Squid software is distributed under GPLv2+ license and includes ## contributions from numerous individuals and organizations. ## Please see the COPYING and CONTRIBUTORS files for details. ## [Unit] Description=Squid Web Proxy Server After=network.target [Service] Type=simple ExecStart=/usr/sbin/squid -sYC -N ExecReload=/bin/kill -HUP $MAINPID KillMode=process [Install] WantedBy=multi-user.target</span></span></code> </pre><br>  Turn it on <br><pre> <code class="bash hljs">systemctl <span class="hljs-built_in"><span class="hljs-built_in">enable</span></span> squid3.service</code> </pre> <br><br>  Install <b>tor, privoxy</b> <br><br><pre> <code class="bash hljs">apt-get install tor privoxy</code> </pre> <br>  I personally did not touch the Tor configuration at all, but the Privoxy config can be brought to this form: <br><br><pre> <code class="bash hljs">listen-address 127.0.0.1:8118 toggle 0 <span class="hljs-built_in"><span class="hljs-built_in">enable</span></span>-remote-toggle 0 <span class="hljs-built_in"><span class="hljs-built_in">enable</span></span>-remote-http-toggle 0 <span class="hljs-built_in"><span class="hljs-built_in">enable</span></span>-edit-actions 0 forward-socks5t / 127.0.0.1:9050 . max-client-connections 500</code> </pre> <br>  Almost done.
