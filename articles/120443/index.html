Although there is a simple answer: "it depends".  And indeed it is. <br><br>  We will build the article in the form of ‚Äúthesis description‚Äù - ‚Äúcounter-arguments‚Äù - ‚Äúconclusion‚Äù.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  I will go to graduate school, because I will become a candidate! </h4><br>  It is clear that the ultimate goal of studying in graduate school - is to obtain the degree of candidate of sciences.  To study for the sake of study, in my opinion, is not advisable.  Therefore, an undoubted plus of training is obtaining the degree of a candidate of some sciences there and the opportunity to teach in higher educational institutions.  Candidate degree is a bold line in your resume. <br><br>  The reality is that candidates of science do not receive a salary + 30% if they work in the field of information technology.  A third-year student with knowledge of PHP, Java, and successfully settling on company A, can easily receive the same money as candidates of science, and sometimes (more often that way) more.  Right?  By no means. <br><br>  But, perhaps, in the future, you want to work as a top manager of a huge company (hehe), then a degree will be very useful to you.  You will have incredibly more formal chances.  There are many examples when people in 10-15 years still returned to universities to get the coveted crust. <br><br>  It should also be noted that in foreign IT companies, candidates of science are very much appreciated.  For example, in Israel, candidates rarely work in IT companies as developers ‚Äî this is considered not logical. <br>  They all work in scientific research centers, universities, which is considered much better than working at Microsoft and Google. <br><br>  Conclusion: a PhD is a long-term benefit under certain conditions and location. <br><br><h4>  In graduate school go only fuckers who can not do anything! </h4><br>  In graduate school are different people, including people from the title.  But this does not mean that there are no intelligent and smart people.  Many more people who are somehow connected with universities are children of university employees, for whom graduate school is a guaranteed workplace in the future with a minimum of effort and the continuation of the family.  These are the people who deliver the most, as the rules and atmosphere are created around and for them.  Everything else, as elsewhere - there are smarter and less intelligent, more lazy and less lazy, more cunning and less cunning, richer and less rich. <br><br>  Conclusion: all kinds of people are going to graduate school. <br><br><h4>  After graduate school, people graduate theorists and cannot solve practical problems. </h4><br>  In part, the correct statement - the main thing for the university is scientific theoretical conclusions, although the practical aspect is also present.  This is often annoying, because the algorithm cannot be considered a scientific novelty, and excessive formalization kills any creative process. <br><br>  But there is another problem - often people are too practical.  Those.  instead of thinking a little over the problem, to abstract from the concrete implementation, people often rush headlong into the pool of code, forgetting everything that often leads to a complete rewriting of the code in the future.  In the process of writing a candidate, a person ponders every word, since one wrong move can lead to rewriting entire sections.  Yes, I am not joking.  By the end of the third year, learning to write one A4 page takes a week, although it is written in blog 3 A4 in an hour. <br><br>  Not the fact that this knowledge will be useful to you.  But this principle works: if we don‚Äôt know something, it seems to us that we don‚Äôt need it.  As soon as we learn something new, we immediately understand how and where it can be used.  This is very easily characterized by the classic phrase: ‚ÄúI know that I know nothing.‚Äù <br><br>  Conclusion: IT profession + postgraduate theoretical skills are two sides of the coin that complement one and the other. <br><br><h4>  And where to experiment, if not in graduate school? </h4><br>  You write an interesting project and you have a lot of ideas, but the authorities absolutely do not accept the waste of time for research.  That's when graduate school is the place for such experiments.  Yes, it is desirable that the topic of work and research be similar, then the knowledge gained in the research process can be used in practical work, and the knowledge of technology and PL can be used in the process of testing one's assumptions and theories.  I personally had that way. <br><br>  Again, if your goal is to simply make money without wanting to do extra gestures, then graduate school will be an unbearable burden for you. <br><br><h4>  Experience in teaching and managing people </h4><br>  In graduate school they are forced to read couples, to lead graduate students, to be a leader, headman, curator, etc.  And do not say that this is an extra experience. <br>  The same experience can be obtained in IT companies, becoming a leader or leading courses, speaking at conferences.  The problem is that it is unlikely that someone will put a team lead at 22 years old.  And they will not be asked and asked at the university. <br><br>  Conclusion: will force to teach.  Good or bad - everyone decides for himself. <br><br><h4>  Communication with other researchers </h4><br>  In the process of writing my work, I met a large number of science-gifted people and even had a chance to go to China to Microsoft Research for an internship.  All sorts of Olympiads, European universities and grants are open to you.  It gives a lot of opportunities and experience.  If to speak as a whole, then, this is probably the most valuable of all that I learned from studying in graduate school. <br><br>  In addition, it teaches us to look not only in the direction of domestic science, but also in the direction of world developments. <br><br><h4>  Everything is so cool, I'm going to graduate school! </h4><br>  Yes, the article up to this point was carrying an awesomely pleasant tone.  You might get the impression that everything is cool.  This is not true. <br><br>  For 3 years you need to pass three exams - specialty, foreign and (oh, fuck), <a href="http://msug.vn.ua/Posts/Details/3154">philosophy</a> . <br>  You need to spoil about 7-8 standard packs of paper for paperwork and a lot of nerves, making them out, for example: <ul><li>  semi-annual reports, activity logs </li><li>  documents for publication of scientific articles, and scientific articles themselves </li><li>  registration of the minutes of department meetings + accompanying documents </li><li>  registration of a state contractual topic, where you should act as a responsible manager in your scientific work </li><li>  reviews on all your body movements </li><li>  orders, TZ, permission for travel </li><li>  list of final documents before and before the defense - up to 50 pieces </li><li>  etc. </li></ul>  This is Kick. <br><br>  The second is that no one needs your job.  No one but you.  From beginning to end, at best, three people will read it ‚Äî you, the supervisor, and the proofreader. <br><br><h4>  General conclusions </h4><br>  So, the pros: <ul><li>  broadening horizons and obtaining deep theoretical skills </li><li>  the ability to articulate your thoughts even where there is no clarity </li><li>  obtaining a scientific degree </li><li>  tight integration of theory and practice </li><li>  opportunity to get a grant, to study abroad for a year or two </li><li>  no need to go to the army </li><li>  teaching experience </li></ul>  Minuses: <ul><li>  bureaucracy </li><li>  there is no opportunity to quietly go on a business trip </li><li>  your work and nobody needs you </li></ul>  Little, but capacious. <br><br>  For each item, you can put your personal coefficients of importance and calculate what happened more.  This will be the answer to the question: do you need a graduate school? <br><br>  A little messy, but hopefully not hopeless.  Thanks for attention. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/120443/">https://habr.com/ru/post/120443/</a></p>
