Today in the menu: sounds, animations, voice control and even whole languages. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/f25/ba3/27c/f25ba327c1d14cf0a2668994788daacd.jpg"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      <a href="https://platform.ifttt.com/maker/academcka/applets/templates"><b>Maker on the IFTTT Platform</b></a> <br><br>  A free set of tools for creating applets that include several actions and perform operations using more complex schemes than if-then.  The solution also gives developers access to a broad base of APIs of various companies, establishing links with other services.  Those who want to popularize their creation can also take advantage of the networking capabilities of the platform - it can be easily presented to an audience of 10 million users. <br><br>  <a href="http://glyphish.com/sounds/%3Fref%3Dproducthunt"><b>Glyphish</b></a> <br><br>  A collection of various sounds for iOS applications in good quality and professional processing.  Samples are systematized both in terms of audio characteristics and purpose (sounds of errors, pop-up windows, scrolling);  A total of 101 types of sounds.  According to the creators, the collection fully pays for a one-time payment of $ 25, which is asked for it;  You can make your own opinion on this subject on the official website, where the versions are presented in worse quality for online familiarization. <br><br>  <a href="http://witheve.com/%3Fref%3Dproducthunt"><b>Eve</b></a> <br><br>  For those who want to try something like that, we hasten to inform you that Eve has appeared in open access - the + IDE programming language ‚Äúwith a human face‚Äù.  The authors aimed to create a language that takes into account the human factor and provides the programmer with the most comfortable experience.  This is achieved through various aspects: from the wording of the error messages to the intuitive syntax.  The structure of documents itself is changing, which for the most part is a coherent text, where specifications are interspersed with code fragments, and the internal navigation system makes it easy to navigate the narrative.  Eve is based on a consistent, consistent system in which each property / value pair is treated as an object called a ‚Äúrecord‚Äù, which provides a simple scheme of operation (writing code reduces to combining nine types of operations) and significantly speeds up the search and elimination of bugs. <br><br>  <b><a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/fuse-studio">Fuse (UX Markup)</a></b> <br><br>  Another alternative to the actual code: a new declarative-reactive XML programming language (this time based on Uno) for creating applications on iOS and Android in real time.  The platform is designed to develop interactive modular components.  The creators traditionally promise speed and conciseness at the expense of quality, intuitiveness, and convenient visualization. Among other things, users are offered advanced UI-technologies: native platform components, OpenGL and vector graphics that allow you to create high-quality cross-platform projects with a unified design.  The platform is compatible with both Objective-C and Java, so the elements that are created in the UX Markup can not only be made into a separate project, but also embedded into third-party native applications.  The code for the Fuse platform using the UX Markup is publicly available. <br><br>  <a href="https://snips.ai/"><b>Snips Voice Platform</b></a> <br><br>  Just add AI: Snips offers a voice assistant for your project.  Creating a customized assistant is done in the web console by using existing requests and creating your own.  Then the team on an individual basis helps to deploy the necessary platform (RaspberryPi, Linux, Android).  The whole "kitchen" is ultimately located on the device, ensuring the user privacy and data security.  English, French, German, Spanish and Korean are now supported, and in the future, the developers plan to expand this list. <br><br>  <a href="https://apitester.com/%3Fref%3Dproducthunt"><b>API Tester</b></a> <br><br>  Cloud solution for testing the functionality, speed and performance of applications.  Features include, among other things, creating HTTP requests, extracting values ‚Äã‚Äãfrom responses, checking values, reusing variables at different stages, and writing logic to Javascript.  According to the developers, the system they created is designed for more complex and dynamic tests than what a favorite Postman has to offer.  The user-friendly interface of the site simplifies and to a certain extent automates the writing of tests, allowing in addition to save them in order to use the results of the queries for further work.  Results can be shared with the team in one click by generating a link.  At the moment, all the functionality is available for free. <br><br>  <a href="https://sqlify.io/convert"><b>SQLify</b></a> <br><br>  Compact web tool: quickly convert CSV and JSON files and (just fragments) to SQL in online mode. <br><br>  <a href="https://flawlessapp.io/%3Fref%3Dproducthunt"><b>Flawless app</b></a> <br><br>  The solution for those who do not want to invest in expensive programs for the collaboration of designers and team developers.  The plugin allows you to load mockups, prototypes and other design sketches into the iOS emulator to constantly compare what should be with what is obtained and adjust the interface along the way.  Designs can be checked both by blending and visually, placing them on the same screen;  scaling allows to carry out comparison up to trifles.  The cost of the plug - $ 15 for an unlimited time of operation. <br><br>  <a href="https://airbnb.design/lottie/%3Fref%3Dproducthunt"><b>Lottie</b></a> <br><br>  A library with a wide selection of ready-made animations After Effects for Android, iOS and React Native.  Animations are rendered in JSON format in real time, so that using them in native applications is no more difficult than simple images, regardless of the platform, and they do not weigh much more.  The developer can customize items for their own needs, in particular, make them interactive. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/332858/">https://habr.com/ru/post/332858/</a></p>
