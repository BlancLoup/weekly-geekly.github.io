  <section class="page js-page"><h1>General law of the evolution of matter</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> Physicists are studying the evolution of particles and the universe.  Biologists study the evolution of cells and organisms.  Social scientists are studying the evolution of human society.  If we compare all these parts of evolution - the formation of the inherent forms of organization of matter, then we can find the general law of the formation of forms - the general law of evolution.  It will equally describe the past and future evolution of matter for us.  So we will know the future of humanity and will be able to prepare for it in advance. <br><br>  Suppose that such a law is found.  Then the correctness of his conclusion needs to be checked by experts - physicists, biologists, and social scientists.  But they need to take into account an important methodological circumstance.  To compare the different parts of the evolution, it was necessary to describe them in a similar, simplified way, different from that adopted in the environment of their study.  A universal description of the whole process of evolution facilitates its understanding by scientists studying only its part.  It will be easier for them to understand each other‚Äôs arguments and be objective. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The general law of evolution has no restrictions on the scale (size) of representatives of the new forms of organization of matter.  And it grows, as seen in every part of evolution.  Therefore, there are no restrictions on the amount of space in which more and more large-scale representatives of new forms are formed.  This means that the process of evolution can take place not only in one of our Universe, but also in many other universes that are proportionate to it, expanding with it in the external environment.  There are philosophical and cosmological grounds for suggesting just such an implementation of the principle of the multiplicity of universes.  And these grounds also need to be checked by experts. <br><br>  The evolution of matter can be represented as the formation in the Universe of more and more large-scale (large) representatives of the next new forms of organization of matter.  For example, the next new form of matter after the formation of atoms was the formation of molecules - systems of atoms.  Thus, a form is a set (or environment) of specific elements of matter representing it.  The element of each new form is a system of interacting elements of the previous form.  Therefore, it occupies a significantly larger volume in space compared to any element of the previous form - it is more ambitious.

      Elements of the original form in suitable conditions can develop, become more complex, acquire new properties and, as a result, unite with each other into systems - into larger-scale elements of the following form.  That is, they can become formative elements.  In accordance with these concepts from the diversity of matter can be identified 7 forms of its organization, in the order of their occurrence: <br><br>  1. quarks; <br>  2. hadrons (mainly protons, neutrons, mesons); <br>  3. atoms (first of all the nuclei of atoms); <br>  4. molecules; <br>  5. cells; <br>  6. organisms (multicellular); <br>  7. civilizations (from the first city-states to space). <br><br>  Let us analyze the process of their formation, trying to describe it according to the general scheme. <br><br>  What are the elements of the first form - quarks - science is not yet known.  And what connection within the quark unites its parts into one whole is also not known.  But it is known that quarks interact with each other through the exchange of gluons.  With the help of this external connection for them, quarks are combined into systems - into hadrons.  These are more large-scale, compared to quarks, elements of the second form of matter.  The gluon bond for hadrons becomes their internal bond. <br><br>  Initially, the newly formed hadrons interact on the principle of their internal communication - the exchange of gluons.  This is known from hard hadron reactions.  After cooling down, stable hadrons ‚Äî protons and neutrons ‚Äî acquire a fundamentally new, external connection ‚Äî the exchange of mesons (pi-mesons or pions).  On its basis, they are combined into more ambitious elements of the third form of matter - atoms (atomic nuclei).  The meson bond for such atoms (nuclei) becomes their internal bond. <br><br>  The newly synthesized atoms (nuclei) interact on the principle of their internal connection ‚Äî the exchange of mesons.  With its help, they can unite into heavier atoms, decay, exchange part of their nucleons.  After cooling, the atoms acquire all of their electrons.  The exchange of extreme electrons becomes for them a fundamentally new, more long-range external bond.  On its basis, atoms are combined into molecules - the larger elements of the fourth form of matter.  For molecules, this bond becomes their internal bond. <br><br>  At first, the molecules interact on the principle of their internal connection - the exchange of electrons.  With its help, they can unite into more complex molecules, disintegrate, exchange their constituent parts.  In aqueous solutions, polymer molecules (in particular, proteins and nucleic acids) acquire a fundamentally new link ‚Äî the exchange of ionized monomer molecules.  The monomer ions serve as material and information carriers for the synthesis of polymers.  Based on this ionic bond, the molecules are combined into self-replicating systems ‚Äî cells (prokaryotes).  These are more large-scale elements of the fifth form of matter.  For them, the exchange of ions in the cellular cytoplasm becomes an internal bond. <br><br>  At first, the cells interact on the principle of their internal communication - the exchange of ionized molecules in the aquatic environment.  On its basis, some of them are united in colonies.  In addition to it, eukaryotic cells in their functionally differentiated colonies acquire a fundamentally new external connection - the exchange of nerve impulses.  Impulses - a new type of media.  Based on new communication, cells are combined into self-reproducing multicellular organisms.  These are the larger elements of the sixth form of matter.  The exchange of impulses becomes their internal connection. <br><br>  The first organisms interact on the principle of their internal intercellular communication - through the exchange of odor molecules and tactile nerve impulses.  Then the organisms acquire a fundamentally new, more long-range light communication - vision.  In her information serve as visual and speculative images, and its carrier - the photons.  Images are expressed in the language of poses, gestures, facial expressions, encoded by sounds, words.  With the advent of writing, social intelligent organisms are combined into self-replicating hierarchical systems ‚Äî civilizations.  These are the larger elements of the seventh form of matter.  Light communication becomes their internal communication. <br><br>  We analyzed 7 forms of matter - from quarks with their external gluon coupling to civilizations with their internal light communication.  The formation of the elements of the seventh form is known by the example of the independent formation of the first civilizations on Earth - on the continents of the Old and New Worlds.  At that time, people united in city-states, and now their descendants are united into a single global civilization. <br><br>  However, it is safe to assume that in the Universe there are many different civilizations, and they were formed from organisms in the way considered here.  And in the Universe, two previous living forms of matter ‚Äî cells and multicellular organisms ‚Äî emerged everywhere in the universe. <br><br>  This is proved by the universality of the form formation path described here.  It corresponds to scientific facts and turns out to be the same for non-living and for living forms, even if the latter are known from one earthly example.  Therefore, this path can be considered a general law of the evolution of matter, having a status higher than physical, biological, and social laws.  We formulate it as follows: <br><br>  Initially, the elements of the original form of matter interact on the principle of their internal communication, and then they implement for this a fundamentally new, more long-range external communication, on the basis of which they are combined into systems - more ambitious elements of the next form of matter. <br><br>  This wording of the law does not say whether all elements of the original environment follow the specified path of development and are combined into elements of the next environment.  As a rule, only part of the elements succeed.  The exception from it are quarks - they all unite in our space into hadrons, there are no free single quarks. <br><br>  From the general (supraphysical!) Law, it follows that civilizations from light communication in interactions with each other pass to a superluminal communication.  Such a future is already guessed from the past and present development of mankind.  His civilizations of the Old and the New World began to interact on the basis of the light connection - the exchange of information expressed in visual and speculative images (information carrier - photons) and coded with words.  Now, with the help of light communication, embodied in the technical means of receiving and transmitting photons, mankind is looking for other civilizations in space and declares them about itself.  Mankind has not yet acquired superluminal communication, but it is already studying the physical processes that open up this possibility.  In particular, methods of space curvature for superluminal flights of ships and instantaneous interactions of entangled particles of matter for instant information exchange are being investigated. <br><br>  Since the information channel of this connection has an almost instantaneous speed, the size of the system of civilizations can significantly exceed the size of the visible part of the Universe - our Hubble volume.  Probably, it almost coincides with the volume of our entire expanding Universe.  The single universal system of civilizations is called a federation - it is a representative of the 8th form of matter.  Certainly, not only informational, but also force interactions were required for its formation.  Just as they were required for the formation of a single earthly civilization.  The power interactions of developed (adult) civilizations are realized through their superluminal ships.  Superlight communication becomes the internal communication of the federation. <br><br>  The general law of the evolution of matter speaks of the growth of the scale of the elements of each new form, but does not establish the limits of their scale and size.  Although it is clear that in a limited amount of space-time, the number of increasingly large-scale elements of new forms will decrease.  For example, on Earth, the number of unicellular forms was greater than the number of multicellular forms - organisms.  And compared with organisms, the number of primary civilizations was incomparably smaller.  Now on Earth, a single planetary civilization is being formed.  But if we take a much larger amount of space-time, for example, a local group of galaxies, then it will already be many habitable planets and single planetary civilizations. <br><br>  Let us see whether it is possible to argue in the same way with regard to the federation - the system of civilizations, one within our Universe.  Can we assume the existence of many universes, expanding in a much larger, outer space for them?  The grounds for such an assumption are - philosophical, cosmological, physical. <br><br>  In philosophy, there are concepts of eternity and infinity, and the Universe known to us does not answer them.  It is not eternal, as well as its relatively small part - our Hubble volume.  Because it, together with our part, originated about 14 billion years ago - in the form of a rapidly expanding volume of an energetically dense medium (ether, vacuum), which contained elements of its future matter.  And no matter how quickly and for a long time this volume expands, it will still have its conditional time boundaries separating its internal space from the external one, where it originated and expands. <br>  Therefore, it is necessary to recognize as eternal and infinite this outer space for the Universe.  Let's call it superspace.  Its existence would not cancel the possible eternal pulsation of our Universe.  Expansion of an object or its pulsation still requires the space in which this or that event occurs. <br><br>  Now we solve such a philosophical question.  Does our universe alone exist in eternal and infinite superspace, or does it have many universes that are proportionate to it?  The historical experience of knowing the world recommends us to avoid any manifestations of geocentrism.  The only planet in the world can be neither a planet, nor a system of planets, nor a galaxy.  These are all unlikely events.  Therefore, the existence in the superspace of a single universe is also less likely event than the existence of a multitude of universes. <br><br>  In addition, only many universes suggest that in some of them there could naturally, in a random way, ‚Äúlife-giving‚Äù fundamental parameters that ensured the evolution of matter ‚Äî as in our Universe.  The assumption of the random origin of the fundamental parameters favorable for the evolution allows the many pulsations of a single Universe.  These parameters could accidentally take shape in one of her pulsations, which is currently ongoing.  However, data on the critical density of matter and energy of the Universe do not allow its compression in the foreseeable future, and without the compression stage pulsations are impossible. <br><br>  In cosmology, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa multiplicity of universes is quite common - the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa multiverse.  There are various options for its implementation, theoretical physicists consider mathematical universes, parallel, bubble.  The most promising, apparently, should be such an option that answers a greater number of questions to the universe.  For example, it offers a qualitative solution to the problem of the cosmological constant, reveals the nature of gravity, explains the instantaneous connection of entangled particles. <br><br>  In this variant of the multiplicity of universes, the general law of the evolution of matter will be used.  The combination of both leads to the creation of a qualitatively new evolutionary model of the world.  But first, a general law needs to be discussed. <br>  I ask the opponents to refrain from minimizing my ‚Äúkarma‚Äù if they want my participation in the dispute, because when I decrease to -30, I actually drop out of the discussion. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/397185/">https://habr.com/ru/post/397185/</a></p>
