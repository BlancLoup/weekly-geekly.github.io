      Peter Bloom (General Atlantic), Chip Hazard (Greylock), and Allen <br>  ahin (CEO) had full power over ArsDigita for almost the whole <br>  of the year.  During this time they <br><br><ol><li>  spent $ 20 million to reach the same level of profitability that <br>  was the company while the CEO was me; </li><li>  Microsoft declined to become the first company to offer <br>  enterprise platform on .NET (Microsoft employee who participated in <br>  negotiating with Allen told me that ‚Äúhe reminds me of many CEOs from <br>  The companies we worked with are now completely bankrupt. ‚Äù); </li><li>  wrote off the previous, fully working version of the system (ACS 3.4) before <br>  The work on the new version (ACS 4.x) has been completed (any professional with <br>  experience in a software development company will say that this is the most successful way <br>  kill the company: Informix died precisely because no one could understand <br>  whether to use the old, stable version 7 or the new "fancy" <br>  version 9, and instead, switched to Oracle); </li><li>  greatly inflated costs (I employed 80 people with basic <br>  wages less than $ 100,000, which brought the company $ 20 million in <br>  year.  The ArsDigita running Greylock, General Atlantic and Allen State <br>  rose to 200 with a lot of managerial positions with a salary in <br>  $ 200,000 or more, programmers with a base salary of $ 125,000, etc.  To this <br>  also contributed to the new work culture from 9 to 17, only on weekdays.  Neither <br>  Allen, neither Greylock, nor General Atlantic considered it necessary to appear in <br>  office at the weekend, respectively, and the staff thought it was over.); </li><li>  completely lost ground as a business and innovation leader in the market. </li></ol><br><br>  How did they manage to achieve such a terrible result?  To find the answer to this <br>  the question is, is to understand what should be the leader of the company, <br>  software development.  First, you need a man who either founded himself and <br>  ran a company, or was a CEO in a company founded by someone (i.e. you don‚Äôt need <br>  a person who has been an employee all his life).  Secondly, you rather <br>  All you need is someone with experience in software development.  Third, you need <br>  someone with knowledge of architectural and subject areas.  Fourth, you need <br>  A candidate with strong technical skills and experience.  Whatever experience you have <br>  Peter, Chip and Allen, they were definitely full zeros in the four above <br>  areas. <br><br>  Software development is not easy: everything is changing very quickly and in fact a lot <br>  very smart people.  In addition, there are companies like Microsoft, where <br>  people work day and night seven days a week, supported by a mountain of cash in <br>  $ 20 billion and a brand recognized worldwide. <br><br>  If you are an investor, you can go head on to the Microsft of this world only with <br>  provided that your managers are smart, diligent and hard working and possess <br>  relevant experience and skills.  If they are not, then you should <br>  to look at a less competitive and large business.  Perhaps you could <br>  offer training services for working with Microsoft or Oracle tools, or <br>  support services for systems written using these tools.  Maybe <br>  you should leave the IT business altogether and channel your capital and your experience <br>  staff in a completely different area, for example, renting furniture and <br>  equipment for parties (not so many companies who give tables and <br>  picnic chairs, which have $ 20 billion in the bank, and MIT doctors of science work <br>  day and night in order to deprive competitors of the business). <br><br>  The attentive reader here will ask the question: ‚ÄúHey, but haven't you been sitting in <br>  Council? ‚ÄùOf course.  But for most of that year, Chip, Peter and Allen didn‚Äôt even want to <br>  hear me: I was annoyed and angry with their criticism of their achievements and abilities; <br>  Self-confidence is the most important character trait for successful <br>  doing things, which means that if I attacked this certainty, then better than me <br>  do not listen to nothing.  I don't even know how much time these three spent with <br>  by engineers.  Chuck Vest, President of MIT, during a closed speech <br>  for faculty members, once called MIT ‚Äúa territory without <br>  praise. "  And when I turned for help to my professor, in the first week <br>  of postgraduate studies in the specialty of Circuitry and Computers <br>  ( <em>Approx. translator:</em> in the original specialty "electrical engineering and <br>  computer science "), then he asked me a couple of questions, said:" You can not solve <br>  This task because you do not know anything and can not even make a due <br>  diligence. " <br><br><h4>  Board seat that never meets </h4><br><br>  At the end of December 2000, they stopped collecting the Council at all. <br>  Directors.  Instead, they collected so-called.  ‚ÄúInvestor meetings‚Äù in which <br>  met Allen, Ern Blackwelder (director of operations (COO), <br>  who was told that he would soon be fired), Greylock and General <br>  Atlantic.  In other words, all the advice except me. <br><br>  Decisions requiring adoption by the Board of Directors were made not only without <br>  votes of the Chairman of the Board of Directors, but even without notifying <br>  Chairperson (me).  For example, after the last meeting of the Council in December <br>  2000, Allen, Ern and VI (a) decided what bonuses to pay the CEO and COO for 2000 <br>  year, (b) Jim Jordan was appointed CFO <br>  (see <a href="http://www.arsdigita.com/news/">http://www.arsdigita.com/news/</a> <em>(from the translator: <a href="http://www.arsdigita.com/news/">better here</a> because the site</em> <em><br></em>  <em>ArsDigita has not been working for a long time)</em> ), (c) decided to get rid of me as Chairman, <br>  about ‚Äúrevealing to the press that I am no more (implying that I resigned, that <br>  did not correspond to reality), (d) hired and appointed Richard Buck <br>  (Richard Buck) to the position of Senior Vice President responsible for Software Development and Design, (e) hired and appointed Dave Menninger to position <br>  Senior Vice President Marketing (again, see <br>  <a href="http://www.arsdigita.com/news/">http://www.arsdigita.com/news/</a> (from translator: use the <a href="&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhg43BnhARaPUHLm-m-q7AjHKbYGxw#42;/">Internet archive</a> , <br>  as above, if interested)). <br><br><h4>  And what about the two places for guest directors? </h4><br><br>  Now you could ask, ‚ÄúWait, what about two places for guests?‚Äù <br>  directors? "Several times during the reign of Greylock, General Atlantic and <br>  Allen, I offered nominations of people who had an idea about the development <br>  BY.  No one was accepted.  On November 22, 2000, I sent a message to Bill Helman <br>  (Bill Helman) and Bill Kaiser (Bill Kaiser), representatives of Greylock with whom <br>  we worked on financing ArsDigita, trying to arrange a meeting and <br>  discuss a couple of candidates for seats in the Council: <br><br><blockquote>  ... However, as a company investor, I am very concerned about the fact that in <br>  Board of Directors and the top management of ArsDigita, there is no <br>  one person with good engineering knowledge.  I don't know what your experience is, <br>  but mine tells me that the technology company will be difficult to achieve <br>  success without technical experts in top positions.  ... <br></blockquote><br><br>  They did not want to intervene in this, arguing that such issues should be resolved with <br>  Greylock employee, who is on the board of directors of a portfolio company, <br>  those.  Chip Hazard, the very man whose lack of technical skills <br>  led to the destruction of ArsDigita.  However, after a couple of weeks, Kaiser agreed <br>  meet me.  We walked around the MIT campus for about half an hour.  After <br>  ‚ÄúI explained to him about problems with our products and finances,‚Äù Kaiser said <br>  "But don't you think that this is just your opinion and that Allen and Chip see <br>  is the situation completely different? ‚Äù <br><br>  Relativity.  It was even pleasant to see that the sophism of Protagoras is alive and well. <br>  after 2500 years.  But the statement that ‚Äúfor a man is true all that seems to him <br>  those "ignores the fact that in business the correctness of one or another <br>  statements can be simply calculated: someone loses money, and someone loses them <br>  earns;  some companies increase their market share, while others lose. <br><br>  We left the idea that it would be possible to get any <br>  help. <br><br>  It seemed that without having the possibility of real management of the company and with a place <br>  Board of Directors of a company that does not convene meetings of this Board, I already <br>  I can not express the opinion of the shareholders of the company.  Notice that to <br>  this time, ArsDigita took the opposite direction to what <br>  we wanted to.  We aD carefully and gradually.  We managed it with a positive <br>  financial result.  We risked, but in very small amounts.  we <br>  conservatively approached our finances (although from the outside we looked fantastic <br>  successful and living on a grand scale, but the coast house for the team <br>  programmers working 6 days a week for 12 hours a day are not at all <br>  luxury).  We purposefully worked as much and thoroughly as Microsoft and <br>  other startups. <br><br>  The approach of Allen, Greylock and General Atlantic, their strategy could be described as follows: <br>  ‚ÄúLook, this table shows that if we don‚Äôt start collecting right now <br>  license fees from our customers, the company will be bankrupt next year. ‚Äù <br>  And, by the way, they will pay us for a product that has not yet been written, but <br>  we will sell it to clients with whom we have not worked yet and with whom nothing has ever <br>  did not sell. <br><br>  Are venture capitalists concerned about such risks?  Give reins <br>  CEO newcomer with no experience in the field?  Put everything on the product, <br>  who "is about to be ready?" Probably not.  General Atlantic manages the fund in <br>  $ 10 billion (see their website <a href="http://gapartners.com/">http://gapartners.com/</a> ).  Even if ArsDigita is completely <br>  will burn, they will have another $ 9.98 billion of other investments.  And what's about <br>  common stock owners?  We have never subscribed to such risks and we do not have <br>  other significant investments.  I have invested 8 years in my ArsDigita Community System <br>  of life.  Gene invested 4 years.  We were not at all pleased to see how <br>  retained earnings and $ 38 million of capital are burned just to <br>  three guys in suits and ties gained experience managing a software company. <br><br><h3>  March 2001: The Last Kick </h3><br><br>  March 2001 was a black month for shareholders.  Many of our most <br>  expensive assets were got out the door.  For example, David Rodriguez (David <br>  Rodriguez) is a monster man who has repeatedly proved that he can bring to <br>  End a project of any complexity and transfer it to a happy client.  Was he <br>  against implementing abstract URLs in a knowledge collection system (knowledge <br>  management, approx.  translator) of the World Bank until I personally <br>  asked him about it by email from australia?  Yes.  Did he claim <br>  constantly that ACS 4.0 is unstable?  Approved.  These examples may be the occasion. <br>  for disqualification dvr (David's nickname, approx. translator) from the diplomatic <br>  service.  But as shareholders, we did not like that the one whose work was <br>  earned more than $ 1 million in profits, while it cost us, God forbid, <br>  $ 200,000 was thrown out the door.  A manager who does not own shares of a company <br>  it may seem logical to dismiss someone who could hook his pride strong <br>  in a word  But when I was both the owner and the CEO, I always let my employees release <br>  steam, even in my address, because I understood perfectly well that in the end <br>  this guy raises the value of my stock. <br><br>  Our co-founder, Aurelius Prokazka (Aurelius Prochazka), was also fired in <br>  purge March 2001th.  Have I and Gina, sometimes, cleaned up his code? <br>  Yes.  Was Ori somewhat demotivated and unproductive in recent months, <br>  frustrated by the complications of ArsDigita‚Äôs financial and market position, did <br>  He is that this is due to the fact that the company is managed by non-professionals?  Yes.  Was <br>  whether he is hasty in his criticism of highly paid nonprofessionals who <br>  did not reach the intellectual level to which he was accustomed to Caltech <br>  (California Institute of Technology, approx. Translator)?  Yes.  But what is this <br>  the company will succeed if you dismiss the one who (a) is one of its founders, one <br>  of those who built a business that earned $ 20 million on an investment of $ 10,000;  (b) until <br>  this has already built and successfully sold a company of a similar plan;  and (c) <br>  responsible for the innovation and interface of several of the most interesting <br>  ACS Modules (nt file storage (abstract file storage, <br>  built as an LBO in an Oracle database, approx.  translator))?  Ori has protected <br>  Doctorate in circuit design, not the art of seduction.  After all, if the cost <br>  companies correlated with how seductive and charismatic her <br>  employees, then Microsoft shareholders would hardly be happy. <br><br>  So what were the company's shareholders doing in March 2000?  Planned joint <br>  research projects between MIT and Orange / France Telecom.  Read one day <br>  courses in Thailand and India.  Refreshed materials for a course of lectures on software development and <br>  Internet Applications (Software Engineering for Internet Applications) at MIT (he <br>  has just been added to the syllabus number 6.171).  Other <br>  in words ‚Äî engaged in arranging their lives and pursuing personal <br>  technical goals, work for other technology companies.  We were hurt <br>  to tears to remember the poor state of ArsDigita, and we <br>  tried not to think about it. <br><br><blockquote><br></blockquote><br><br>  Anger, goddess, sing Achilles, Peleev‚Äôs son, <br>  Terrible, which Aheyanam thousands of disasters have done: <br>  Many souls mighty glorious heroes cast down <br>  In gloomy Hades and spread them themselves to the greed of carnivores <br>  The birds of the neighborhood and the dogs (Zeus's will was done), <br>  From that day, like, having erected a dispute, they were kindled with hostility <br>  The shepherd of the peoples Atrid and the hero Achilles noble. <br>  Who from the gods of the immortal feat of theirs to a hostile dispute? <br><br>  - Homer, <a href="http://www.pgeu.net/dirs/pge/pge05/100064/e100064.html">Iliad</a> , Song of the First (translated from ancient Greek N. Gnedich) <br><br><br><br>  Peter Bloom, General Atlantic employee, representing their interests in our <br>  The Council in March 2000 was not in tears.  He was angry, just as angry as <br>  over the past few months.  Although Agamemnon did not take his girlfriend <br>  Breeze to become a priestess in the temple of Christ, Bloom's anger was no less than the anger of his sons. <br>  Pelea  My habit is to remind him that he would do better if <br>  chose more worthy opponents (for example, Microsoft or Oracle, and not <br>  37-year-old woman living in a 2-room apartment in Cambridge) did not help <br>  cool it off.  But what was probably the last straw in his cup, this <br>  perhaps that is how I described the work of venture capitalists to one of the teachers in <br>  MIT.  (I said that "it reminds me of a nursery who managed to steal <br>  Boeing 747 and now they click all the switches, trying to force it <br>  take to the air. ‚Äù) <br><br>  Peter Bloom sent me a message of the following content on March 28, 2001: <br>  ‚ÄúBecause you don‚Äôt like it that way <br>  company, you can resign yourself before the next meeting <br>  Council.  This is, of course, your personal decision, but it is the decision that <br>  reduce the likelihood and depth of public humiliation and significant damage to your <br>  professional reputation, what will be your dismissal from the post of Chairman <br>  Board of Directors. ... Those actions that you have taken recently, <br>  as well as the messages that you sent to different people, put you in a very <br>  unsightly and ugly situation, I recommended that you contact someone <br>  for legal assistance.  I sincerely hope that the lawyer you trust, <br>  will be able to explain to you all the seriousness of the consequences of your recent <br>  speeches and accusations before you irrevocably destroy your reputation and <br>  your financial future. " <br><br>  Shortly after receiving this message, I went to the ArsDigita office to pick up <br>  <a href="http://philip.greenspun.com/dogs/alex">Alex</a> have Eve.  But my pass did not open the door anymore. <br><br>  When a company with $ 10 billion of assets threatens you with ‚Äúirrevocable destruction <br>  your financial future, ‚Äùwhich means you need a lawyer.  So <br>  way, thanks to the instructions of Peter, I directed my feet to Sam Mon-Mahlo <br>  (Sam Mawn-Mahlau) and Paul Mahoney of Edwards and Angels.  It is they <br>  prepared a ‚Äúshareholder agreement‚Äù that changed the company‚Äôs charter <br>  As long as ArsDigita did not bargain on the exchange, its CEO and <br>  the president will be elected by direct vote of the shareholders.  And the next item <br>  the same agreement was followed by the election of Philip Greenspan as CEO.  One more <br>  The point of the same agreement was the election of Tracey Adams and Eve. <br>  Andersson (Eve Andersson), two of the company's vice-presidents, on the board <br>  Directors.  And since the shareholders agreement required three of <br>  Representatives of the company in the Council should be ‚Äútop management‚Äù, we also <br>  raised them to the ranks of the Executive Vice Presidents, so, for every fireman <br>  happening. <br><br>  The result of this ‚Äúshareholder consent‚Äù was the reduction of the role of the VI precisely before <br>  the level to which they were entitled, i.e.  2 seats in the Council and veto power <br>  significant operations. <br><br>  Shareholders voted on the same day CNET published a note on <br>  ArsDigita Terminated Open Source Software Support Policy <br>  and all future versions will be distributed according to the traditional licensing scheme, <br>  and also reported that "the former Chairman of the Board of Directors," Philip <br>  Greenspan left the company.  The next morning, April 6th, the courier arrived at <br>  street address  Prospect 80 (headquarters of ArsDigita) and delivered the package to Allen, <br>  who informed him that he was demoted from the position of ‚ÄúPresident and CEO‚Äù to <br>  position of "president".  I called Allen and reassured him that I did not intend <br>  to make any immediate reshuffle that i'm ready <br>  completely forget about everything that happened over the past year and continue working with <br>  on the terms of our initial agreement (I am developing, <br>  education propaganda;  Allen does the rest).  I said that <br>  next few weeks I want to devote a detailed analysis of what <br>  condition is our product, our customers, the company.  In response, Allen said <br>  I was exactly what I wanted to hear and I calmed down, having decided that I could work <br>  with him. <br><br>  (Ending follows) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/31544/">https://habr.com/ru/post/31544/</a></p>
