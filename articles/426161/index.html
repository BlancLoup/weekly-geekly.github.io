      This is the first such delivery in the world [ <a href="https://habr.com/post/364017/">no</a> ], and it also ignores the standard rules for the safety of air transportation.  These drones do not define and avoid obstacles - they have no radar, no cameras, or other imaging systems.  They fly on GPS, on tracks recognized as free from trees, buildings and other obstacles.  Over the past five months, the service has made 500 deliveries, and so far without a single victim. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  It works like this: you drive an order into the app on a smartphone (‚Äútwo hamburgers, no onions‚Äù), the Aha cook loads the order for the drone.  You track the delivery, go out to meet the drone, and if everything is fine at the point of discharge, you agree to accept it.  Then the drone lowers your burgers on a string, and flies home with a buzz. <br><br>  Delivery costs about $ 7.  It pays for the service, says <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/maronk/">Maron Christofferson</a> , the chief executive officer of Aha.  ‚ÄúIt takes 25 cents on electricity,‚Äù he says. <br><br>  Delivery can take from 4 minutes, compared with 25 minute delivery on the roads with heavy traffic.  This is ideal for hot food (the most popular product is burgers), but customers also like the delivery of products (the most popular is bananas) and equipment (mostly electronics). <br><br>  Christofferson became interested in autonomous delivery technologies in 2014, looking for a way to cope with the rising cost of labor.  Turning to the companies involved in drones, he found that most of them were indifferent to the tiny market of Iceland. <br><br>  In 2015, he contacted <a href="http://www.flytrex.com/">Flytrex, a</a> startup from Tel Aviv, who sold GPS drones to GPS lights.  Flytrex has developed a logistics system based on these beacons, rather than doing the drone itself.  ‚ÄúFrom my point of view, this approach was much more pragmatic,‚Äù says Christofferson. <br><br>  ‚ÄúFedEx does not make trucks, they buy them,‚Äù says Yariv Bash, director of Flytrex.  ‚ÄúWe do the same with drones.  We have the know-how to choose the right drones and tailor them to our needs, but our core competencies lie in the field of logistics and cloud services. ‚Äù <br><br>  Christofferson told the Icelandic administration in charge of regulating airspace that they have a choice: Iceland may remain at the tail of the list of countries that have developed delivery by drones, or it may be in the front row.  And to be in the forefront, it is necessary to develop safety rules. <br><br>  More than a year of exchange took place, and Aha received a work permit.  The first experimental deliveries began this year. <br><br>  Aha uses <a href="https://www.dji.com/matrice600">DJI Matrice 600 hexacopters</a> capable of carrying up to 3 kg of cargo and weighing 15 kg in full gear.  They are able to fly 8 km - 4 km in one direction, and then back - which is enough to cover the entire Reykjavik from the center, where the company's headquarters is located.  Flight paths of drones are constantly monitored to avoid new buildings.  To reduce the risk of drones on the possibility of flying over water and uninhabited industrial zones. <br><br>  Initially, the drones arrived at a dozen special relief points on the outskirts of the city.  A company representative needed to wait for the drone and pick up the package from the cargo hold.  Such deliveries allowed Aha to gain experience and reassure regulators in terms of safety. <br><br>  Then in August, the company received permission to drop parcels on a rope to selected homes.  ‚ÄúThe drone is capable of lowering the package practically on the mat in your backyard,‚Äù says Bash.  You just have to convince the neighbors to agree with this. <br><br>  But it rarely causes problems, says Christopherson.  He claims that when mowing the lawn you give them more inconvenience. <br><br>  Blind flights have been a controversial issue in other jurisdictions around the world.  In the US, the Federal Aviation Administration is holding on to its ‚Äúfeel and avoid‚Äù requirement.  But the Office has nevertheless allowed recent test flights, including those conducted by <a href="https%253A%252F%252Fwww.bloomberg.com%252Fnews%252Farticles%252F2018-08-08%252Ftoddler-s-popsicle-by-air-marks-milestone-in-u-s-dr">Wing</a> , a division of Alphabet;  in them the drone flies further than the operator can see. <br><br>  Bash says that two countries - he is not yet ready to reveal their names or even continents - are already ready to resolve projects like Flytrex and Aha launched in Iceland.  And why not, he says, if the delivery of drones risks less than many other things allowed in our lives. <br><br>  ‚ÄúWhat's safer,‚Äù he asks, ‚Äúallow a 16-year-old teenager to drive a two-ton car to your house every time you want a hamburger, or send a 15-kg drone not suffering from lack of sleep last night?‚Äù </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/426161/">https://habr.com/ru/post/426161/</a></p>
