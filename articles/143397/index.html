  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Freemyapps in Brief (free software for iOS)</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  So, there is a service such as m.freemyapps.com - a service to get paid free games for iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad for free and legally.  And, as it turned out, not everyone knows what it is, or how to use it.  I will try to briefly tell you what they eat it with, how to make an account and why. <br>  First, it is an advertising service in which you need to install free applications (as a rule, games and clients of social networks), play them for 30 seconds or more, get points for it, and exchange them for paid games.  Under the cut - how and why you need a second account, you can get what you need for this. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So, first of all we decide whether you need it or not.  Therefore, I'll start right away with the minuses <br>  1. There are not so many applications (which are provided free of charge).  At the moment, there are 23 of them for iPod and iPhone. Of them, the whole series of Angry Birsds, Max Payne, GTA3, Cut The Rope, Fruit Ninja are interesting.  Once was Infinity Blade 2. In general, sparsely.  Games like Angry Birds cost about 260 points, GTA - 500, Infinity Blade, Assasin Creed - 1300. At the same time, from 80 to 120 points should be given for installing one sponsor game. <br>  2. Applications (which are sponsored and which should be put) are few.  That is, for the evening of the first installation, you can put everything, earn money on three-four games like evil birds, then new applications will not appear often.  On average - one per day.  So to accumulate on Tetris for Ipad (2030 points) will not be easy. <br><br>  Now to the pros.  It all works, it's all legal, after 30 seconds the application can be removed, and in an hour you can really save up for some toy.  I had GTA3 on the first night. <br><br>  So let's get started. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>

          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      1. Getting a US account. <br>  If you already have a US iTunes account (App Store), go to step 2. <br>  Open iTunes on your computer, go to the iTunes store, click on your email in the upper right corner, click Exit.  (Either the shop-exit menu).  If we now try to make an account, the system will require a credit card number as a required field.  Therefore, we go to the store, choose any free application, try to buy it, and then go to the process of creating an Apple ID.  Select States as the country (link above the registration form), select None as the credit card.  If you plan to also buy music, applications, and so on, then I advise you to choose the state of Florida and the real business card.  The point is in taxes on the application, and a little lower in the link there is an explanation why.  If the American account is needed just for free applications, then enter what we want.  Then simply register, and confirm the email address. <br>  The same first point, but in the form of a four-minute screencast - <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D3s9C4sWFVqA">www.youtube.com/watch?v=3s9C4sWFVqA</a> <br><br>  2. The remaining actions are performed directly on the device.  Go to the settings - store - exit, log in with an existing Apple ID, enter a new account.  Nothing wrong with the old account will not happen, you can freely switch between them. <br><br>  3. Turn off on the device opened iTunes.  Sometimes it helps from the bug "failed to open the application." <br><br>  3. Open in mobile Safari (this is important, Opera will not work) link <a href="http://m.freemyapps.com/">m.freemyapps.com</a> , or by QR code below: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/692/826/586/69282658698aba22348f91a8cb6a928e.png"><br><br>  <i>not referral</i> <br><br>  (if using a QR code, be sure to click on the Open In Safari button in your program). <br><br>  4. Next, click on any application (for example, Angry Birds).  After that, you will be prompted to install the certificate.  After that, the site will know the identifier of your device, and then remember you even after reinstalling the system. <br><br>  5. Next we will transfer to the page of sponsored applications (or we can go there ourselves).  Actually, the algorithm is simple - click on the application, ‚ÄúInstall‚Äù, it is downloaded, open it, use at least 30 seconds (and I still use one of them), re-navigate to the site. <br><br>  6. Repeat point 5 until the free apps run out.  Attention, if you have an iPhone or iPod, applications for iPad will not work.  This applies to both sponsorship and gift applications. <br><br>  7. Go to the Gifts section and select the application you like.  If an error has occurred, and points have been withdrawn at the same time, it is not terrible - just select the already selected application in the list of gifts (it is at the bottom). <br><br>  8. It is not advisable to enter the site from the main account (non-US).  I do not know why, but new applications disappear when switching to an American account.  Do you want to see if new applications have appeared - either go directly from the US account, or just watch the m.freemyapps.com website from a personal computer or an alternative browser. <br><br>  9. Two accounts.  It is not scary and does not entail problems or inconvenience.  From under the Russian account you can play the games received in the US and vice versa.  Between them, you can freely switch.  It will not entail the removal of previously installed applications.  If you reinstall the system - go to the App Store from the device, go to the updates - previously purchased applications - not on this iPod (iPhone, iPod) and just download from the Internet for free.  As a bonus, the American account allows you to buy music from iTunes. <br><br>  10. Update purchased applications.  If the App Store reports that the application has been updated, simply change your account to a US account and update this application. <br><br>  Almost the same, but in other words: <br><ul><li>  <a href="http://www.iphones.ru/iNotes/33279">Getting an American account.</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.appleinsider.ru/app-store/free-my-apps-platnye-prilozheniya-besplatno.html">Freemyapps - paid apps for free.</a> </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/143397/">https://habr.com/ru/post/143397/</a></p>
