Epic Growth Story with CEO Maps.me</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Epic Growth Story - <a href="https://gett.com/ru/">Gett</a> and <a href="http://egconf.ru/">Epic Growth Conference</a> flash mob, where product, marketing and design experts share epic growth stories.  In a blitz-interview format, Evgeny Lisovsky (Maps.me) shares groshakhekami and experiments that brought a multiple product growth. <br><br>  Share your Facebook stories with the hashtag #epicgrowthstory.  The best authors will receive prizes from Gett and get into the collection and to the site. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ah_ZDD6nfMM" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Watch the interview and read the transcript under the cut. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Experiments that brought multiple growth of the product? <br></h3><br>  We have over two years increased retention about two times.  Retention is the key metric.  But since we are a grocery company (this is not e-commerce, where you take more goods, take more money, and thus can grow very quickly).  In Maps.me, hacks are rather grocery.  In April 2016 we launched the ability to edit maps.  This has attracted an additional large audience of contributors, who not only enthusiastically improve the maps, but also help the entire OpenStreetMap community to develop.

    <h3>  What product is hooked? <br></h3><br>  I really liked the RealtimeBoard product.  He brought our new designer.  I used google docs presentations.  Just arrows and pictures to make up some kind of TK.  And then I saw the RealtimeBoard.  The cool thing is that this is an unlimited board with the advantage of collaborative work.  Everything is thought out to the smallest detail.  Even when compared to Google Docs Presentations, you can see how carefully the RealtimeBoard team worked the product.  The user is really convenient and comfortable. <br><br><h3>  What product you want to completely redo? <br></h3><br>  There is a YouTube that everyone uses.  He has one fundamental problem - poor content cataloging.  In ‚ÄúLiters‚Äù we, for example, carefully worked through the catalog, so that it contained genres and subgenres, so that you could select the necessary topics and select books from it.  It is impossible to choose ‚Äúsearch‚Äù when there are 100 thousand books in the catalog, especially when you do not know what you need. <br><br>  YouTube has a problem: there are no genres.  There is just a bare search in which you are ‚Äúslaughtering‚Äù something.  I subscribe to a lot of different channels about neuroscience, astrophysics, and so on.  But on the main page absolutely nothing is structured. <br><br>  Another product that I want to remake ... I have been using my own project management technique for a long time.  She works for Google Docs Project.  In the tables I make an Action Plan, where I put the name of the task, the deadline, the status.  If the task is completed - hiding.  And, accordingly, you always have an up-to-date task list with priorities.  But not enough bundles with the calendar.  I often use the calendar to plan my work day and week.  But there is no link of one with another.  There are products that try to combine it.  But I have not yet seen the perfect product.  It‚Äôs good to have it on Google Docs calendar, for example. <br><br><h3>  OMTM (One Metric That Matters)? <br></h3><br>  First of all, it is retention - the recurrence of the audience.  This is one of the reasons why the ‚ÄúMoika Moika‚Äù, including, did not fly.  The reason is bad user experience.  The man came to the car wash, and there, in fact, the status was irrelevant.  And he: ‚ÄúOh!  Does not work".  And that's all.  Retention falls.  Falling retention - falling unit economy.  In essence, the retention curve correlates directly with LTV (Lifetime Value).  That is, with the money that you can get from the project.  It doesn't matter how: freemium model, premium model, advertising model. <br><br>  Retention is a fundamental metric.  If you achieve high retention, then everything will be fine.  This is a factor that includes almost everything - the quality of the product, and the business idea itself: whether it works or not. <br><br><h3>  Useful framework for product development? <br></h3><br>  We use the Atomic Design framework. <br><br><h3>  How to improve the UX product? <br></h3><br>  Work with feedback from your audience.  Your audience can tell you a lot if you ask questions correctly.  Conduct surveys, research.  It works very well with us.  We regularly conduct fairly large-scale surveys.  And a very large part of our audience willingly agrees to answer many questions.  The last time we collected 60 thousand responses, sending out a proposal to pass a survey of approximately 300 thousand users. <br><br><h3>  ANA moment in liters and Maps.me? <br></h3><br>  In liters at some point in time there were all the formats (and still is).  14 formats.  In 14 formats there is a book, well laid out.  Many find it very difficult to move from the concept of paper books to electronic ones. <br><br>  For example, in the software industry there is such a thing: people find it difficult to trust that which cannot be dropped on the foot.  Why did the box software appear?  This is the way people move from the physical to the virtual world.  The same, probably, with books. <br><br>  When you realize that you can download it, put it on your hard drive, and it's yours forever.  Probably, this is such an ANA moment in liters.  You can also call the UTP or DNA. <br><br>  In Maps.me, the ANA moment is that the application works without the Internet.  This is a key UTP.  If you are ‚Äúin the middle of nowhere‚Äù and nothing works for you, open offline Maps.me maps and you are saved. <br><br><h3>  How to check ideas before starting development? <br></h3><br>  A lot of analytics - to study the experience of other projects, especially projects of similar subjects.  I recommend: the public company on the site has a section ‚ÄúInvestor Relations‚Äù, where a lot of information and presentations for investors are presented.  You can still listen to the ‚Äúphone call‚Äù based on the results of a quarter or a year (they often ask questions from which you can stress a lot for yourself). <br><br>  I also advise an excellent resource ‚ÄúThink with Google‚Äù.  It has a lot of useful analytics, which Google does on a regular basis on various topics, for example, E-commerce, Travel. <br><br><h3>  The main quality of SRO? <br></h3><br>  Well understand the audience and the ability to argue, to defend their position on the product vision.  The ability to negotiate.  Perfectionism.  Doing awesome. <br><br>  Leave posts with the hashtag <b>#epicgrowthstory</b> and share your best product growth stories.  Authors of the most epic stories will receive prizes from our partners <b>Gett</b> and get on the site and in the telegrams @ epicgrowth. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/353774/">https://habr.com/ru/post/353774/</a></p>
