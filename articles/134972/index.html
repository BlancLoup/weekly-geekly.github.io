  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Automating the processing of citizens in the E1 system of the Euphrates - as we did</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Recently, the task of partially integrating the external information resources of an organization with an internal business process management system began to appear quite often.  For example, the formation of documents of the organization on the basis of data obtained from various web forms located on the organization's website.  After all, data is collected for a reason, not to fill the trash can.  They are accumulated, processed, collected in a common statistical database.  And often the data coming from web forms are integral to the organization‚Äôs business processes. <br><br>  A striking example is the processing of appeals of citizens entering the various bodies of executive power, which, according to the current legislation, must be registered and considered without fail.  The task of automating this process was recently set for the E1 Euphrates system.  Not only delivered, but also resolved. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  As a rule, citizens' applications to state authorities come from web forms located on the official websites of government agencies, by e-mail, in the form of paper mailings and, finally, in the form of oral statements made during personal visits. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>

      Most often, given the wide distribution of information and communication technologies, citizens' appeals are received by filling out web forms on Internet portals.  Due to the use of the auto-import function, the information from the electronic applications is promptly entered into the E1 Euphrates system.  Site scripts after filling out the form automatically generate a letter of a certain format, which falls on a special mailbox.  And it is already being processed by the same E1 Euphrates auto import service with a specified frequency.  Having received the next letter, the system creates a temporary document where it places all the information from the appeal.  And this is the beginning of the business process for processing appeals, which includes the E1 Euphrates auto-processing service.  He performs several tasks at once.  The first thing he does is analyze the letter for the presence of the necessary information to register the appeal.  At this stage, not only spam is eliminated, but the presence of mandatory information in circulation is checked.  After analysis, the system begins to automatically ‚Äúdivide‚Äù the letter into separate details and fill in the fields of the registration card of the appeal and the applicant.  If the applicant is already registered in the system, then the system can supplement his data, if necessary.  After creating the applicant's card and the appeal card, the E1 Euphrates links them together and sends them on to the state organization for further navigation along the corridors (rather, through communication channels).  At the same time, ‚ÄúE1 Euphrates‚Äù independently analyzes the content of the appeal and sends it to the particular department and that employee who should deal with this issue.  Thus, we can eliminate situations, and when an employee of the administration sits and puzzles with whom to send the document, or when the public health department receives complaints from citizens about high utility tariffs.  And this is only a small part of the auto-processing capabilities. <br><br>  We will talk about how E1 Euphrates works with letters and oral appeals of citizens in the following posts. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/134972/">https://habr.com/ru/post/134972/</a></p>
