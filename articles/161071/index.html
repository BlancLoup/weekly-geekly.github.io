  <section class="page js-page"><h1>In SearchMan made a rating of "detectability" of applications on the App Store</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Analytical company SearchMan, funded by 500 Startups, has released a new tool for mobile application developers who want to find out how their applications <i>are available</i> in search on the App Store Search.  This dimension is more important than ever in connection with the changes made in September in iOS 6 that affected application ratings: some sections were deleted or moved, and a new interface was proposed instead of lists.  Also in the update, special attention was paid to the search and recommendations (we then <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/apps4all/blog/150681/">wrote about it on Habr√©</a> ). <br><br>  According to Niren Hiro, the executive director of SearchMan, the launch of a new product, which was simply called the ‚ÄúSearch Visibility Score‚Äù, occurred at the request of the developer community.  ‚ÄúEveryone asked us to create a tool that would answer the main question: how accessible is my application in searching for the App Store?‚Äù He explains.  But developers are not the only ones who are interested in this.  ‚ÄúWe began to receive inquiries from customers, market researchers and mobile ad networks who wanted to get more data about 'impulse players', who get a strong boost, without huge advertising costs,‚Äù added Hiro. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f73/f1f/c43/f73f1fc4319e6a4647d6de3e33ed3346.png"><a name="habracut"></a>

      After a month of testing and user reviews, a rating was offered for each application on the App Store.  He appeared in the new section of the SearchMan website called " <a href="https://searchman.com/ios/search_visibility_rank/US/iPhone/all/en/All%2520Categories/">Market Data</a> ", which includes the Top 25 applications, as well as the rating of leaders and outsiders of applications for the iPhone and iPad for the American, British and Japanese versions of the App Store.  Hiro says SearchMan will add support for the Chinese version in the first quarter of 2013, and also plan to add new information to the Market Data section in the future. <br><br>  How it works: <br><br>  This indicator is the total amount of the estimated significance of all the keywords of the application.  For each word, the so-called ‚Äúaccessibility factor‚Äù is taken into account, corresponding to the position in the search for this application for this keyword.  This accessibility factor is based on the ranking in the search for each keyword, and varies depending on the screen size of the device.  For iPhone (iOS 6), with only one search result per page, SearchMan assumes that each position is only 90% accessible from the previous one.  For iPad (iOS 6), with six applications available per search page, each page is only 90% more than the previous one. <br><br>  For example, in the Games category in the American App Store, Bejeweled Blitz is the most visible result, since the application is well positioned for ‚Äúbig‚Äù search queries like ‚Äúblitz‚Äù, ‚Äúgems‚Äù, ‚Äúfacebook‚Äù and other things.  In this case, the game itself is only at 37 positions in the top of free games. <br><br>  In the past, developers mostly fought to hit the top in their category to get more downloads.  But the release of iOS 6 forced the creators of applications to do ASO (App Store SEO), as positions in the search for the "correct" keywords became the main source of traffic.  And the example of Bejeweled Blitz here is very indicative - the game is relatively low in the ranking, but its ‚Äúdetectability‚Äù is very high due to the correct description and, accordingly, the position in the search results. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/161071/">https://habr.com/ru/post/161071/</a></p>
