  <section class="page js-page"><h1>All domestic projects on Kickstarter in one post. //Part 2</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In this post I collected all the Ukrainian, Belarusian, Russian projects that have ever been launched on Kickstarter.  Recently, not only computer games were launched from our developers, but also several gadgets and interesting projects in the design category. <br>  I have already done a large selection in <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/185628/">this Habrapost</a> , then there were 39 projects, now there are already 65 of them! <br>  All projects with useful data and links are available in the table via googlebox.  I hope that the article will be useful to everyone who is interested in crowdfunding both in the role of a buyer, and in the role of the author of his own project. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/442/bc4/5cb/442bc45cb75415062a271ad1ae072602.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  This list cannot be complete, since the projects should be launched from a US, Canada, UK resident (and soon Australia and New Zealand), so it‚Äôs difficult to keep track of domestic projects, unless the authors themselves go to contact through the media.  If you know more domestic projects - write in the comments, I will add. <br><br>  <b>IMPORTANT</b> <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc%3Fkey%3D0ArjqlbdemXgEdEI0VThjSG5XOXkyTWxkNUt1OG9UWWc%26usp%3Dsharing">In this Google file</a> you can always find a constantly updated project table.

      And now I will try to comment on some projects.  By the way, I commented on 27 projects <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/185628/">in my previous post</a> , so there will be only fresh comments here. <br><br>  15. <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1194220798/septikon-uranium-wars">Septikon</a> is a board game that has already been released in Russia from the publishing house Mir Hobby.  I worked on a team preparing and running this project (an unforgettable experience). <br><br>  18. <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/woodenshark/taptap-wristband-a-new-way-to-say-i-love-you">TapTap</a> is a smart bracelet that <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/woodenshark/taptap-wristband-a-new-way-to-say-i-love-you">comes</a> with a range of sensors and can vibrate.  It supports out of the box, such as an alarm clock.  In addition, the bracelet supports <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IFTTT">IFTTT</a> , and therefore gestures and all applications that can be controlled with them. <br>  The project, by the way, from the engineering side is carried out in St. Petersburg, and the developers have already successfully distributed the products of the previous company Lightpack, from which they collected as much as $ 500k! <br><br>  24. <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1808187125/steam-squad">Steam Squad</a> - a game from St. Petersburg developers who made a couple of habraposts about their creation.  Very strange they were fees.  The average payment on the backer is $ 127, which is quite a lot compared to the average Kickstarter payment of $ 70 per person. <br><br>  25. <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/starworksart/universum-war-front-fps-rts-moba-rpg-in-one-space">Universum: War Front</a> - a game with interlacing heaps of genres.  It is reported that it makes one Ukrainian guy.  It is difficult to believe in it, especially for me with experience of running the project on Kickstarter. <br><br>  26. <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1535515364/knock-knock">Knock-knock</a> - a toy in the genre of horror and survival.  She collected money for a long time, but about a month ago she came out in Steam, where everyone can buy it and evaluate it. <br><br>  27. <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1400130230/oceania-online-mmo-rpg">Oceania</a> - the second attempt of this game on the COP.  Knight with letters VIP on the shield and in full armor against the backdrop of palm trees and the beach looks wild.  The project is clearly screwed up.  So, for example, after several ‚Äúempty‚Äù days, 8 people suddenly appear, giving a total of slightly more than $ 7.5k and so two times.  At the COP, this does not happen =) <br><br>  30. <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/digitilus/skyjacker-space-combat-sim">SKYJACKER Space Combat Sim</a> - space pirate shooter.  This is the fourth project at the COP under the SKYJACKER.  So far only one was successful, where money was collected for the designer of the spacecraft.  The designer, by the way, not so long ago came the Beckers, seemingly satisfied.  But the game collects funds sluggish, despite the publication in the PC Gamer. <br><br>  54. <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/iblazr/iblazr-the-led-flash-for-smartphones-and-tablets">iblazr</a> - diode flash for smartphones.  Very stylish and versatile flash that can be inserted directly into the jack, and onto a flexible leg.  It has its own battery, so it can be a simple flashlight, and can illuminate an object for macro photography.  Charges say that the device is in demand. <br><br>  55. <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/259704821/the-magic-wallet-slim-and-unique-design-rfid-prote">Magic wallet</a> is a magic wallet that I bought myself and was, like all the other sponsors of the project, very disappointed.  The purse turned out to be very regrettably assembled, and the quality components left much to be desired.  The author of the project is cursed by all his backers and swearing at him on the project page, a little more than 100% <br><br>  58. <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1693742244/victoria-wallet">Victoria Wallet</a> - bam!  And immediately afterwards another magic wallet that has just recently finished collecting.  This wallet I have not supported =) <br><br>  58. <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/digitalabstracts/playing-arts-a-deck-of-poker-cards-by-54-top-artis">Playing Artst</a> - a deck of cards, where each card is made by a new artist in its own unique style.  As a set of pictures - cool, like a game deck, in my opinion - not very.  The authors of the project are sparrows shot, this is their second deck of cards, the first one was successfully sold through PayPal, and this one successfully completed the fees at the COP. <br><br>  60. <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/608696909/magic-cooking-gloves-integral-part-of-your-bbq-exp">Magic cooking gloves</a> - another domestic file.  The developer said that everything was incorrectly calculated and he did not have enough money, but he did not say that to his sponsors from Kickstarter.  On the project page, the creator is scolded, as is the whole Kickstarter, which does not give guarantees, so is the whole of Russia.  It is sad. <br><br>  65. <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1142415631/soulandcook-a-hand-drawn-cookbook-of-delicious-dis">Soul &amp; Cook</a> - cookbook with cool illustrations from a charming red-haired girl.  Remember the illustrated cards at number 57. So this girl is the wife of the author of the project Playing Arts. <br><br>  66. <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/cradle-of-mir/the-cradle-of-mir-at-burning-man-2013-russian-team">The Cradle of MIR</a> - a project of a MIR station layout on a 1: 3 scale, made of wood and suspended inside a large pyramid at the Burning Man festival of modern art.  I wrote about the project in <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/186326/">this post</a> , a small fire flared up there, as the project is specific. <br><br><h5>  Interesting moments: </h5><br>  1. Among domestic projects frequent cheating.  If, for example, <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1808187125/steam-squad">Steam Squad</a> could ‚Äúsell‚Äù expensive lots and receive donations without rewards from its community, which, as I understood, has long been familiar with the game and is looking forward to it, then three new projects this month openly throw money at themselves .  What is the reason?  Perhaps the authors of the projects think that by throwing money they will get popular on the main page of the COP and this will give them fees.  But this did not happen in the projects.  Here is an example of a project's life-chart. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/839/6be/999/8396be999fae106c2d4a77143a901c83.jpg"><br><br>  Here we see, in recent days, an application that has been left unattended for a month, suddenly receives generous investments of $ 1000 per person.  If suddenly these are anonymous patrons and micro-investors, then it would be better if they, without any COP, the commission transferred them money directly. <br><br>  2. It should be noted that domestic projects and their authors fulfill their obligations! <br><br>  So in Steam two games have already been released.  These are <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1535515364/knock-knock">Knock-knock</a> and <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1684781151/legends-of-eisenwald">Legends of Eisenwald</a> .  Backer already sent space designer <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/digitilus/skyjacker-starship-constructor">Skyjacker</a> .  The English version of the popular KKI Berserk ( <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1194220798/berserk-war-of-the-realms">Berserk: War of Realms</a> ) has already been partially sent out and the final part of the shipment will be completed soon, and we have already sent a do-it-yourself version of the board game Septikon - Print 'n' Play. <br>  But there are a few black sheep.  Due to poor quality and poor build expectations, the magic wallet from Timur's <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/259704821/the-magic-wallet-slim-and-unique-design-rfid-prote">Magic Wallet</a> did not justify.  And the authors of the project of gloves for <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/608696909/magic-cooking-gloves-integral-part-of-your-bbq-exp">cooking, Magic cooking gloves,</a> have disappeared altogether. <br>  That is, two weak projects for sixty-five good ones (or rather, not 65, but half as much, because you have to cross out the unsuccessful ones). <br><br>  3. Every month more and more projects from the post-Soviet space appear on Kickstarter, and every month these projects are getting steeper and cooler! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/201818/">https://habr.com/ru/post/201818/</a></p>
