Today I will introduce you to the Pro Monoprice Premium Hi-Fi DJ MHP-839 headphones from the Pro series, which are designed for both professional DJs and music lovers.  Headphones were highly appreciated by consumers in the US market for an incredibly high-quality sound at a low price.

      It seems that the developers have set a goal to create headphones with a simple design and minimal configuration, where 80% of the cost will be the cost of sound. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In this review, I propose to do without a colorful preface and immediately go to the description of these headphones. <br><br>  <b>Packaging:</b> <br>  Monoprice Premium Hi-Fi DJ MHP-839 headphones come in a regular cardboard box with dimensions of 23x23x9 cm and a total weight of 470 g. To be honest, the quality of the box can be described as ‚Äúthere is no other way‚Äù.  But it often happens that the manufacturer deliberately makes a cheap box in order to reduce the cost of the advertising ‚Äúwrapper‚Äù and provide the consumer with a quality product. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8bd/fb4/d62/8bdfb4d6205b474dac60cb4216de834b.JPG"><br><br>  After opening the box, we find that the manufacturer did not report something.  We see directly headphones, two cables and an adapter and all.  There is not even an instruction; I meet it the first time, although all the main parameters are indicated on the box. <br><br>  There is also no cover, while the headphones are foldable and it would be nice for the manufacturer to include the simplest cover made of fabric. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e6c/d47/b49/e6cd47b4950d4a7c81b09c8b527c9e85.JPG"><br><br>  <b>Appearance and ergonomics:</b> <br>  Now directly about the Monoprice Premium Hi-Fi DJ MHP-839 headphones themselves.  Headphones of the usual size for overhead, closed type, completely cover the ear.  The body is made of black plastic with a matte surface, which is very practical.  This is a very lightweight headphones and weighs only 230 g. <br><br>  Headphones are not felt on the head, as if becoming a part of your body, due to ergonomic parameters: folding cups with soft ear cushions and shape memory of your ear.  Cups can rotate in different planes, reducing the pressure on the ears. <br><br>  The ear cushions and pillow on the headband are very soft and pleasant to the touch, made of durable high-quality eco-leather.  By the way, even the most top-rated headphones have long since switched to artificial leather, as it is more practical in daily use.  Cups are replaceable and you can pick up different colors. <br><br>  The upper part of the headband is made of flexible rubber, which increases the comfort of shrinkage and durability.  The headband is height adjustable. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d70/db1/60e/d70db160e2e246e6bcba504693bfede8.JPG"><br><br>  I was pleased that the headphones are easy to fold, due to turning, even more correctly, turning by 180 ¬∞ from the cups.  This is the way and there are chips of these headphones. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6a7/7a8/cc5/6a77a8cc5bde4675afbe27b7aec73d32.JPG"><br><br>  By the way, ear cushions are replaceable, so you can always change them, for example, to a different color.  By color and availability, you can always check out our <a href="http://www.sound4you.ru/">mobile sound shop "SOUND4YOU"</a> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b0d/35f/520/b0d35f520d99456e9ff598a70b1e0357.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Sound:</b> <br>  Monoprice Premium Hi-Fi DJ MHP-839 headphones have 50mm drivers.  Below I will describe the technical parameters, and then my impressions of the sound. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/537/ca2/ba1/537ca2ba17bd4354b727303e3e593164.JPG"><br><br>  <i>frequency range</i> <br>  The frequency range is probably the most meaningless parameter in the characteristic and more used by marketers.  A person hears in the range of 20 Hz - 20 kHz, at the beginning of this range there are low-frequency sounds (bass), at the top - high-frequency sounds.  The task of any headphones is to correctly reproduce this range, without failures, without wheezing and a bass hum, without hissing and rattling on HF.  This ability reflects the amplitude-frequency characteristic (AFC) and is usually represented as a graph of the dependence of volume on frequency.  Therefore, the smoother and smoother the curve, the more accurate and clear the sound.  Unfortunately, I did not manage to find the frequency response graph from the manufacturer, but the 20Hz-20kHz range is indicated on the headphone box. <br><br>  <i>Sensitivity (sound pressure)</i> <br>  Sensitivity is the headphone efficiency: the larger it is, the louder the headphones sound, regardless of the source.  Monoprice Premium Hi-Fi DJs are very loud, the manufacturer indicates 100 ¬± 3 dB, which corresponds to the fact of measurement using the VUMeter program, which can be found on the Apple Store or Google Market ... <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b1b/13b/653/b1b13b6538f740e6a975e1b4f750f9eb.JPG"><br><br>  <i>Load impedance</i> <br>  For Monoprice Premium Hi-Fi DJ, the manufacturer set the resistance to 40 ohms.  If you do not go into radio engineering, you can say the following: the greater the resistance, the more powerful source is needed for headphones and the less influence the source itself has on the sound.  In other words, the headphones will work fine with both players and more powerful sources, such as DJ "turntables". <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/73b/d4d/d9c/73bd4dd9c1ff4a0db4b2d54eed77f8f6.JPG"><br><br>  As you might have guessed from the review, I was delaying for a long time to share my opinion on the sound.  In fact, because it is difficult to describe the sound of such inexpensive headphones that sound like expensive ones.  Write honestly and only good - to raise doubts among readers.  But I still try.  Headphones are definitely loud.  The developers have focused on low frequencies, which is not surprising.  The sound is very bright and juicy.  The low frequency range is very much forced, but it does not clog either medium or high.  In this case, by the standards of the class, you can even talk about such things as control and detail.  The bass is deep and impresses with its softness.  The low frequencies sound very nice, constantly there is a desire to shake your head in time with the music! <br><br>  Midrange - the weakest side of inexpensive headphones, as a rule.  But Monoprice Premium Hi-Fi DJ was pleasantly surprised here.  The timbres sound deep and natural, which is not expected from headphones for such a price.  Although sometimes the mids sound somewhat distant, especially against the background of rhythmic bass and bright high frequencies. <br><br>  Honestly, even this result can be considered outstanding in the price range. <br><br>  In general, the sound quality of these headphones is at a height, however, like other models of the Monoprice line, this tradition has gone from the first legendary <a href="http://www.sound4you.ru/">Monoprais 8320</a> headphones, which I will definitely make a separate and large review with all their pluses and minuses.  Subscribe to our blog - all the fun is yet to come. <br><br>  <b>Connection:</b> <br>  The big plus of the headphones is that the cable is interchangeable.  The set includes two cables: one is standard standard length - 1.25 m, the other is studio, thick and long - 3.5 m. All connectors are 3.5 mm and have gold-plated anti-corrosion coating.  Included is an adapter 3.5-6.3 mm. <br><br>  Cords and adapters of excellent quality, which is not surprising, since the company Monoprice started on the market and to this day remains the leader in the market of adapters, adapters and cords for professional musicians. <br><br>  <b>Price and warranty period:</b> <br>  You can always check the availability and buy Monoprice Premium Hi-Fi DJ MHP-839 headphones on our website at the <a href="http://www.sound4you.ru/">Mobile Sound Store ‚ÄúSOUND4YOU‚Äù</a> <br>  On all Monoprice models, we provide a manufacturer's warranty of 12 months. <br><br>  In this review, I also want to add that the Monoprice line has <a href="http://www.sound4you.ru/">Monoprice Hi-Fi headphones Light Weight model MHP-865 (light version)</a> , you can say it is a younger brother, they have a slightly different design, they have softer ear cushions and a standard resistance of 32 Ohms Both of these parameters tell us that they are more ‚Äúpopular‚Äù, they also have a fixed cable, but at the same time the cups also unfold by 180 ¬∞ C like the ‚ÄúDJ Pro‚Äù series. <br><br>  <b>Findings:</b> <br>  If you are a lover of good quality sound, but are not willing to overpay for the work of marketing top headphones, then Monoprice Premium Hi-Fi DJ MHP-839 is your option. <br><br>  The only minus that I can single out is a rather austere, simple design.  Although this indicator may be a plus for many: no bright inserts, chrome-plated parts, etc. <br><br>  Excellent powerful bass sound paired with good ergonomics are great for everyday use.  Headphones are suitable for work in recording studios, and for amateur listening to music. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/OkC_-jUJtks%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhh6alO4EhN0hz0XjHftFBG40ucCzA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/365551/">https://habr.com/ru/post/365551/</a></p>
