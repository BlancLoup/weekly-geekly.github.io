      As part of internal processing, we classify incidents according to the resources affected. <br><table><tbody><tr><td align="left" width="200">  High criticality </td><td>  Incidents related to key server segment resources or critical user segment resources (resources that handle critical information from a business, financial, or legal point of view). </td></tr><tr><td align="left" width="200">  Average criticality </td><td>  Incidents related to non-critical server segment resources. </td></tr><tr><td align="left" width="200">  Low criticality </td><td>  Incidents related to non-critical resources of the user segment (ordinary user). </td></tr></tbody></table><br>  An analyst at the Monitoring Center arbitrarily determines the degree of criticality if he believes that an incident can lead to serious negative consequences. <br><br><h2>  <font color="orange">Monitoring results</font> </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/o1/0l/_s/o10l_sjfda1dodosxzyo8cx-q6g.png" alt="image"><br><br>  In the period from <b>January 1</b> to <b>June 30, 2018</b> , employees of the Monitoring Center monitored information systems of organizations with a total number of connected nodes of about 28,200 (workplaces, web, mail, file storages, etc.).  Due to the growing interest in the creation and operation of information security monitoring centers, we were able to attract new regular customers in the first half of 2018 and launch several pilot projects. <br><br>  In the six months of 2018, sensors recorded 112 million information security events. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fp/wy/zv/fpwyzvt5goxgbpksy0b403ed7gq.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The decrease in the number of registered IS events, taking into account the increase in the number of monitored resources and incidents, is due to the following factors: <br><ol><li>  Our signature analytics are refining signatures that give a large number of false-positive responses in a particular controlled information system.  Due to the already significant experience in writing rules and evaluating their behavior in different organizations, signatures have become less dependent on network features and more unified, while at the same time not losing effectiveness in the presence of ‚Äúbad‚Äù traffic. </li><li>  Some rules of the AM Rules database have been optimized.  Due to this, many similar events are aggregated. </li><li>  Thanks to the first two points, the Monitoring Center responds faster to DDoS attacks and other IS incidents that manifest themselves in a large number of signature triggers, and helps prevent their development at an early stage. </li></ol><br>  <b>434 incidents</b> were recorded. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/cv/9t/o8/cv9to8ny8zmufoz8zsndmwu9pk8.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The 20% increase in the number of incidents compared with the second half of 2017 is due to the fact that new customers actively joined the Monitoring Center.  A new monitoring infrastructure is almost guaranteed a surge in the number of detected incidents that the owner of the infrastructure previously simply could not notice.  It is necessary to deal with this "new peak", and the number of recorded incidents is sharply reduced. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/bn/05/pr/bn05prirrsw-pvr_8yhqpsdl3n4.png" alt="image"><br><table><tbody><tr><td align="left" width="300">  <i><b>‚ÄúInformational event‚Äù</b> - informational events that may be useful in the analysis of an incident.</i> <i><br></i>  <i><b>‚ÄúAttack or exploitation‚Äù</b> - events that indicate attempts to remotely execute a code or exploit vulnerabilities in controlled resources.</i> <i><br></i>  <i><b>"Scan"</b> - events that indicate the study of the network before attempting an attack.</i> <i><br></i>  <i><b>‚ÄúPassword Selection‚Äù</b> - events that indicate attempts to gain access to monitored resources by selecting authentication data.</i> </td><td align="left" width="300">  <i><b>‚ÄúViolation of the IS policy‚Äù</b> - events that indicate actions that allegedly violate the requirements of the IS Policy of a controlled organization.</i> <i><br></i>  <i><b>"Trojans and viruses"</b> - events that indicate the fact of infection of controlled resources with viruses or malware activity.</i> <i><br></i>  <i><b>‚ÄúDDoS‚Äù</b> - events that indicate attempts to carry out distributed denial of service attacks.</i> </td></tr></tbody></table><br><br>  The distribution of recorded events by type has not changed much compared to the second half of 2017.  The most noticeable change is that the attempts to select passwords for various services are in the first place.  Policy violations, scans and informational events still remain in the "top". <br><br>  The number of events in the "Scanning" category has increased.  In the first half of the year, we have increased the number of customers, and, consequently, the number of nodes.  If the monitored node looks directly to the Internet, then it is daily exposed to a large number of scans by bots.  Most clients take priority in controlling attacks from the external network, so they put nodes with white addresses on the monitoring.  From this increase in the "Scan" and the reduction of "Informational events", more characteristic of internal nodes. <br><br><h2>  <font color="orange">Recorded incidents</font> </h2><br>  Among the identified <b>434</b> incidents: <br><table><tbody><tr><td align="left" width="180">  Incident class </td><td align="left" width="120">  Low criticality </td><td align="left" width="120">  Average criticality </td><td align="left" width="120">  High criticality </td><td align="left" width="120">  Total incidents </td><td align="left" width="120">  Share of incidents </td></tr><tr><td>  Malicious software </td><td>  3 </td><td>  75 </td><td>  101 </td><td>  179 </td><td>  41% </td></tr><tr><td>  Attacks and attempts to exploit vulnerabilities </td><td>  four </td><td>  68 </td><td>  57 </td><td>  129 </td><td>  thirty% </td></tr><tr><td>  Password Selection </td><td>  2 </td><td>  27 </td><td>  35 </td><td>  64 </td><td>  15% </td></tr><tr><td>  Violation of information security policy </td><td>  6 </td><td>  32 </td><td>  6 </td><td>  44 </td><td>  ten% </td></tr><tr><td>  DDoS </td><td>  3 </td><td>  five </td><td>  ten </td><td>  18 </td><td>  four% </td></tr></tbody></table><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jx/nd/qd/jxndqdmkodtnjocd9bprhgjb-fk.png" alt="image"><br><br>  By the largest class of malware, we observed the following trends: <br><ol><li>  The more nodes on the monitoring - the more incidents with the malware. </li><li>  As in the second quarter of 2017, infections with the WannaCry and Petya / notPetya malware families continue.  Despite the general coverage of this problem, there are still a lot of vulnerable nodes. </li><li>  Most of the malicious files found are cryptocurrency mining software.  Hackers have become a bit ‚Äúkinder‚Äù and are trying to capitalize on user resources. </li><li>  Also, we often find adware potentially unwanted software.  Most users download it along with hacked or free software and when installing software to quickly find drivers, for example, DriverPack and analogues. </li></ol><br>  As for the "Exploitation of Vulnerabilities", we continue to observe a large number of attempts to exploit vulnerabilities in Apache Struts, Drupalgeddon, and EternalBlue. <br><br>  A large number of incidents were instituted to exploit the EternalBlue vulnerability.  It sounds sad, but statistics show that users have not yet been protected from such sensational vulnerabilities.  Despite the fact that the download of encryptors through this vulnerability is already minimal, it is actively used to distribute other malware.  And if the encrypted data is visible immediately, then the activity of other malicious software can not even be noticed by an ordinary user. <br><br>  For example, at the end of June, we conducted a study of the machine infected by the coder.  We found that the destructive actions were carried out through a remote connection to the system.  The attacker launched an encryption program and, after a few minutes, disconnected from the victim's node. <br><br>  Our researchers have found the file of the running encryptor disguised as the svchost.exe process (an encryption program of the GlobeImposter 2.0 family, as it turned out during a detailed analysis of the file), as well as traces of launching other suspicious programs.  Among them was the ProcessHacker utility installed (with the KProcessHacker driver).  With its help, the attacker has completed the privileged processes and freed the files used by the processes for their subsequent encryption.  The hacker did not stop there and, taking the opportunity, he introduced a miner into the infected system (why not take the maximum?). <br><br>  Mining files for Litecoin (LTC) mining were found in the system directory.  Among them was the miner's file itself, libraries for maintaining multi-threading and sending HTTP requests, as well as a program that collected and launched all of this with the parameters the attacker needed.  This file was added to the Task Scheduler and started at every system startup. <br><br>  If the attacker had not launched a cryptographer on the hacked system, then perhaps the owner of the automated workplace would not have noticed a third-party presence.  And the resources of the system would be used for the extraction of cryptocurrencies and / or attacks on other users in the local network. <br><br>  The remaining mass of incidents in the category are attempts to exploit XSS, the introduction of PHP and SQL injections. <br><br>  The distribution of IS incidents relative to the days of the week in the first half of 2018: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/89/jw/at/89jwatohuzmgiwn7tr0camcdze0.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Usually, phishing mailings are conducted on Monday, they send malware disguised as reconciliations, acts, etc. Most likely, such activity is aimed at people who have not yet left the weekend.  We also connect the bulk of new clients from the beginning of the week, which also gives a big boost in the events, especially for such categories as password selection, attack and exploitation of vulnerabilities. <br><br>  Distribution of information security incidents in the first half of 2018: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pw/zr/gl/pwzrglpeu9ozruie7npsogrvi4e.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The increase in incidents is associated with the expansion of our customer networks.  At least 2 organizations increased the number of sensors at controlled sites by April.  Plus, in the spring and summer there were a lot of pilot projects. <br><br>  Also, our signature-based analysts constantly write rules for fresh vulnerabilities, which helps to catch new attacks on client resources. <br><br><h2>  <font color="orange">TOP sources</font> </h2><br>  The sources of attacks in this case are IP addresses that were participants in the network interaction with controlled addresses and attempted to damage the infrastructure. <br><br>  The map shows the location of the first hundred IP addresses by the number of registered events.  Most of these addresses are located in Russia, Ukraine, China, USA, Germany and the Netherlands. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xq/5m/k7/xq5mk73ezxkqn8ociazdzgppw0e.png" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  <font color="orange">TOP Incident Segments</font> </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/va/kj/qt/vakjqt9x1e2clo4rfnjtmbth1aq.png" alt="image"><br><br>  In the first half of 2018, user workstations were the most frequently affected by unwanted effects. These are 60% of all incidents on controlled resources.  In second place are attacks on web servers and other services. <br><br>  The main types of attacks on web brutfors and attempts to exploit vulnerabilities, including the Apache web server.  On user workstation - malware, attempts to exploit vulnerabilities in browsers.  A large number of miners established by illegal means. <br><br>  Previous articles: <br><ul><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/post/423863/">‚ÄúStandoff‚Äù on PHDays 8 - A View from SOC</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/post/420361/">Bug when working TextBox.GetLineText in .NET WPF</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/post/417285/">Where to insert quotation mark in IPv6</a> </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/424475/">https://habr.com/ru/post/424475/</a></p>
