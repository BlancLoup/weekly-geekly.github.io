We have come a long way from the first tests to participation and victories in international competitions and exhibitions.  Finally, we are now starting to collect pre-orders for the release of the first-ever copies of the Cup-Yula. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/faf/d17/7fa/fafd177fa8524dfea72426f9c8b1654c.jpg"><br><br>  Under the cut video and a detailed story. <a name="habracut"></a>

There, she was faced with the fact that in the cafe there were no normal teaspoons, and sometimes even chopsticks.  Therefore, stir coffee or tea with sugar was very problematic.  And then, trying to rotate the glass with her hand, she thought - why not create a cup that does not require a spoon to mix the contents?  So the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Cup-Yula was born. <br><br>  At the beginning of 2012, having met me, Anastasia remembered her long-standing idea, and together we set about implementing it.  The main condition was the absence of complex mechanisms, engines, batteries, etc.  Such a cup should be made entirely of glass or porcelain and be at home no less convenient and unpretentious than ordinary dishes. <br><br><h4>  Work on the concept </h4><br>  The first sketches that Nastya showed me were similar to the toy of the same name.  The cup should have the shape of a whirligig and should be closed with a special lid equipped with a handle for rotation.  It became absolutely obvious to me - in this form, the product is unlikely to interest anyone.  And we began to refine the form, bringing it closer to the traditional tea pair. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a38/38a/4f7/a3838a4f742c489fbbb0df8e0a24e09c.jpg"><br><br>  At first glance, it seemed to me that the task was simply impossible - either it would be difficult to use the cup and it would not be aesthetic, or the drink would spill out, and the cup would regularly tip over.  Still, we managed to find a balance and solve all the problems. <br><br>  First of all, to achieve the WOW effect, the cup must rotate around its own axis after a jerk by hand (due to inertial forces).  For the stability and safety of the structure, it was decided to make it in two parts - the cup itself and the saucer stand.  The saucer is equipped with a special protrusion - the axis of rotation, which is set on the notch of the cup. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c7f/b5f/9a5/c7fb5f9a5d904dd299400405da144aa6.jpg"><br><br>  This made it possible to lower the center of gravity of the cup and prevent its accidental tipping over.  In addition, for extra stability and splash protection, we have given the cup a pear shape. <br><br>  Further, we came to the conclusion that in order to mix the beverage, the cup should have internal fins that will hook and tighten the liquid.  And here I had the idea to tilt the ribs in the direction of rotation (clockwise).  This made it possible to direct the flow of liquid downward and thereby prevent splashing. <br><br><h4>  Successes </h4><br>  As a result of all our transformations, the design of the cup became not only fully functional, but also acquired a peculiar aesthetics of an unopened bud.  We managed to do something incredible - harmoniously combining complex functionality with the beauty of forms.  As nature itself does. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/862/9c0/a52/8629c0a5227b410c94bad1df91e5f104.jpg"><br><br>  This is probably why Chashka-Yul (English name Cup PEGTOP) reached the finals of the international competitions RED DOT DESIGN CONCEPT, JAMES DYSON AWARD, and also won the DESIGN AND DESIGN INTERNATIONAL AWARD. <br>  At the Milan Design Week, which took place in April of this year, especially for which we printed out the final prototype, Chashka-Yula made a splash!  It was pleasant to observe the enthusiastic views of people, some of whom returned to our booth and brought their friends and children. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1c6/c53/0d5/1c6c530d5be44cb39a8ffe6562b8648c.jpg"><br><br>  By the way, the video that we prepared specifically for the final of the RED DOT contest randomly fell into the hands of the authors of the portal <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5962821/spin-this-brilliant-ridged-mug-and-it-automatically-stirs-itself">GIZMODO.com</a> .  As a result of the publication of the article ‚Äú <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5962821/spin-this-brilliant-ridged-mug-and-it-automatically-stirs-itself">Spin This Brilliant Ridged Mug and It Automatically Stirs Itself</a> ‚Äù, literally over a week more than 100,000 users from all over the world watched the video.  We received many letters wishing to purchase this product, but at that time we were not ready. <br><br>  Our cup periodically gets the spotlight of the media, for example, not so long ago on the Moscow 24 channel there was a <a href="http://www.m24.ru/videos/56846">report</a> about the <a href="http://jamesdysonaward.com/">JAMES DYSON AWARD</a> award, in which we repeatedly participated, reached the final and even won (with <a href="http://www.gavrilovadesign.com/%3Fp%3D159">another project</a> ).  A story about a cup and a demonstration of the final prototype from 2 minutes and 20 seconds. <br><br><a name="upd1"></a>  <b>UPD:</b> Please note that there is a slight flaw on the prototype shown in the video - the hole on the cup was overfilled with acrylic enamel.  As a result, the gap between the cup and saucer has increased and the cup has a greater roll than it should have.  In the final product, the gap will be smaller (about 2 mm) and the cup will rotate more evenly. <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/yaG-KO1HpEs%3Ffeature%3Doembed%26start%3D147&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhi62nP--gF8GP606eZlVC5BrPB7oA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h4>  Start of production </h4><br>  In parallel with the patenting, for a long time we tried to find a manufacturer for the production of glass cups.  But, unfortunately, it turned out that the casting molds used in conventional production consist of two halves, which, due to the inclined edges of the cup, cannot be opened without damaging the product.  And the creation of a separate production line can be quite a costly undertaking. <br><br>  At the moment, we decided not to wait any longer and start producing high-quality porcelain cups, which, of course, is not transparent, but has a number of advantages in front of the glass: the possibility of any coloring of the glaze, the application of logos and drawings, and, of course, porcelain has a lower production cost . <br><br>  At the first stage, we decided to use Russian crowdfunding, and later we plan to enter the foreign market, which is so vigorously responding to the novelty. <br><br><h4>  pre order </h4><br>  Cup-Yula can be a truly original gift.  It can turn ordinary tea / coffee drinks into a source of positive mood and eliminate the need to wash teaspoons and listen to the sound of their punches on the glass. <br><br>  You can support the project and become the world's first owners of Chashki-Yula at <a href="http://xn----7sbab1ci3fj1d.xn--p1ai/">Chashka-Yula.RF</a> <br><br>  The first batches of cups will be made in white color from porcelain using traditional hand-made production technology (St. Petersburg) and packaged in elegant transparent plastic boxes.  Depending on the order quantity, the price varies from 1,100 rubles to 800 rubles for 1 pc. <br><br>  <b>UPD 06/30/2015:</b> <br><h4>  Now Yulu Cup can be bought in the online store <a href="http://xn----7sbab1ci3fj1d.xn--p1ai/">http://chashka-yula.rf</a> </h4><br>  Friends, it has been almost two years since the publication of this post.  During this time we managed: <br>  - successfully launch and debug production (thanks largely to your support, for which a special thank you!); <br>  - win gold at the prestigious international industrial design competition A'DESIGN AWARD 2015 (Italy); <br>  - participate in the largest international exhibitions (Milan, Amsterdam, Dublin, Lodndon, Beijing, etc.) <br>  - light up on TV, advertising on youtube (lipton goodstarter); <br>  we even managed to find ourselves at the round table of the State Duma!  )) <br>  But the most important thing is that we finally launched our own online store! <br>  <a href="http://xn----7sbab1ci3fj1d.xn--p1ai/">http: //Cashka-Yula.RF</a> <br><br>  By the way, each of you has the opportunity to earn on our affiliate program with very bad conditions ... </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/234079/">https://habr.com/ru/post/234079/</a></p>
