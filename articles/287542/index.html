  <section class="page js-page"><h1>All are equal before the laws of media.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The Infocomov Round Table " <a href="http://www.infocomtech.ru/2008/schedule/rian/">Convergence in the Media. The Point of Application - the Network</a> " stood out favorably last Thursday against the rather dramatic background of the forum as a whole.  Its theme - the survival of the media in the neighborhood with the Internet - in itself captures only those who are engaged in mass communications professionally.  But in the end it concerns each of us.  Without tiring you with lengthy reasoning, I will give here the key, in my opinion, quotes from the discussion. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Alexander Zharov</b> , Deputy Minister of Communications: ‚ÄúThe traditional media today are facing challenges: <br><ul><li>  How to win the race with the Internet sphere? " </li></ul>  <b>Demian Kudryavtsev</b> , General Director of the Kommersant Publishing House: ‚Äú89% of our income now is print media.  But after 10 years of newspapers, such as we know them, will not. " <br><br>  ‚ÄúFor each media - cinema, theater - the phoenix story of rebirth from the ashes went its way.  Under the influence of time, they were able to change and get a new quality.  But the media's turn has not come yet. ‚Äù <br><br>  ‚ÄúNewspapers in the United States began to die not when the Internet appeared, but when people stopped reading newspapers at breakfast.  They began to work far from home, listen to the radio a lot on the way, and at work quickly run over the headlines of Internet tapes.  Circulations of newspapers began to fall at times.  This process is waiting for Russia. "

      ‚ÄúToday in the newspapers there is no exclusive fact.  We are not hijacking the Web.  All our rating hits before the 98th year are information.  Our hit today is the intonation of the narrator.  Intonation defines a brand, and already on it the reader chooses information for himself. ‚Äù <br><br>  ‚ÄúWe rely on e-paper.  The newspaper should not depend on the physical media, it should use all means of communication.  But at the same time it must remain material and tangible, otherwise it will simply cease to be a newspaper.  The newspaper tomorrow, as we present it today, is a roll of electronic paper.  The Daily Prophet of ‚ÄúHarry Potter‚Äù - that‚Äôs it! ‚Äù <br><br>  <b>Vasily Gatov</b> , Advisor to the Director General of Media 3: ‚ÄúThe only happiness of the existing media is that the ratio of‚Äú conservative ‚Äùand new [ <i>which requires new channels of information delivery</i> ] is 8: 1.  And over the next 5-6 years, the place of traditional media will not decrease. ‚Äù <br><br>  <b>Alexander Gerasimov</b> , General Director of City-FM radio station: ‚ÄúWe do not save our homeland, but we do ratings.  And this is all about making money at lower cost.  We have only 8 full-time journalists and we attract ‚Äúpeople's correspondents‚Äú - there are a lot of them.  And despite the fact that 8 of those are 38 of these, it turns out savings. " <br><br>  <b>Dmitry Mednikov</b> , editor-in-chief of the Vesti-24 channel and the Vesti-FM radio station: ‚ÄúI would not dramatize.  We are simply talking about a way for classic media to get additional sources of profit. ‚Äù <br><br>  <b>Alexander Zharov</b> : <ul><li>  How to deal with piracy, theft of material? </li></ul>  <b>Demian Kudryavtsev</b> : ‚ÄúThe threshold for entering the information market is now minimal.  And we are not inclined to work on raising it, because the low bar is a guarantee from any autocracy. <br><br>  But there is another side to this.  Last year, our publishing house spent a total of $ 11 million on creating information. I know the budget of a popular Novosibirsk copy-pasteur website ‚Äî $ 70,000. But our advantages are quality, intonation, reasonable use of technology (when the reader remains a reader, and he doesn‚Äôt collect newspapers all over the internet for himself. ‚Äù <br><br>  <b>Dmitry Mednikov</b> : Yes, we will continue to sue! <br><br>  <b>Alexander Zharov</b> : <ul><li>  How to prepare journalists to work in a new environment? </li></ul>  <b>Anna Kachkaeva</b> , Head of the Department of Television and Radio Broadcasting at the Moscow State University Journalism Department: "We are entering an era when young people will have to learn a lot themselves, and young people should understand this." <br><br>  ‚ÄúToday's reader is easy.  He does not count on a deep immersion in information, vividly perceives intonation and emotions.  A dramatic plot is important for him, not an informational part. ‚Äù <br><br>  ‚ÄúNew technologies for a journalist are not a headache, but additional opportunities.  A modern editorial board should use all communication channels for both collecting and delivering information.  We must be able to work for different audiences. " <br><br>  <b>Alexander Zharov</b> : <ul><li>  ‚ÄúHow to navigate in the noise of information?  How to build mass media education? </li></ul>  The task of the ministry is to formulate ways to support new content distribution channels.  That is, eliminate digital inequality. <br><br>  Bright, positive, branded news - almost advertising - will always win. " <br><br>  <b>Anna Kachkaeva</b> : ‚ÄúThe current‚Äú jump-like ‚Äùyoung people do not live in the same vertical information system.  They make up for themselves an overall picture of mosaic pieces: television, radio, podcasts, RSS. " <br><br>  In conclusion, Alexander Zharov noted that interest in the topic was already quite ripe and it was time to move the discussion to high levels of the ministry. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/287542/">https://habr.com/ru/post/287542/</a></p>
