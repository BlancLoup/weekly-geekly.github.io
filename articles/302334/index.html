In the questionnaire, he indicated that he was doing well in math.

Do you want a geometry problem, decide? ‚Äù-‚Äú And then! ‚Äù. <br><br>  - There are tasks to build, heard about these?

      The kid didn't come to dinner.  But after 10 months, he came to play on the desk at Yandex, because he entered the MEPhI (and in general he is from Moldova), because I gave him the contacts of my classmate, a yandexoneid, who helped me on mathematics via Skype. <br><br>  Summer schools and camps are cool and useful.  Under the cut, a tale about how we catch teenagers over a precipice in rye and arrange their blood pressure for them, bites us with python and pumps them over in the field of social engineering. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8cb/8a0/e93/8cb8a0e9369746b1b4b53399dfa538fd.jpg"><br>  This is Boris.  He is a camel.  Boris can spit and bite, but he does not suspect that he is waiting for him this summer. <br><br><h4>  Why goto </h4><br>  First of all.  When I was a schoolboy, I was fortunate enough to almost accidentally get into a summer school in Vladivostok.  It was one of the significant and key experiences.  Yes, there was my first real victory in Starcraft CTF and Quake 2. Back in school, lecturers from the Physics and Moscow State University gave lectures, which gave me some special moves that I used at olympiads in physics and mathematics. <br><br>  Secondly.  Radio engineering and programming have always been curious to me, but being in the ‚Äúhole‚Äù, it was very difficult for me to find people willing to suggest something, to share experience.  Now I see in the face of the GoTo project exactly the structure that was so lacking when I was in school.  There are also like-minded people and teachers (more precisely, professionals working in their field) who are ready to pump the young during off-hours. <br><br>  Thirdly, at school we had a ‚Äúgang of like-minded people‚Äù - and we dragged each other in mathematics, physics, Quake2 and Starcraft.  We entered different universities, spent less time side by side and as a result - mutual induction and mutual reinforcement in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãprogany, IB and Counter Strike were not as strong as in school.  On the basis of GoTo, a community of like-minded people is being formed (well, not quite soul-to-soul, there are always their own graters), who are looking in the same direction and are ready to work together on a project. <br><br>  Therefore, it is already the third year that I have gotten involved in the GoTo team.  I wish you the same. <br><br><h4>  As it was already </h4><br>  <b>AYCamp (ABBYY + Yandex) 2014</b> <br>  Reporting article on Habr√©: <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/234567/">‚ÄúYour own educational camp with poker, a 3d printer, robots and landing on Mars‚Äù</a> <br><br>  We also wrote several articles together with schoolchildren. <br><ul><li>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/233545/">Like Mitnick trolled the FBI.</a>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/233545/">Articles on Habr from the camp for schoolchildren</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/234881/">Interview with Roman Udovichenko.</a>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/234881/">Code Jam TOP 10 or how well olympiadnik live</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/236287/">1903 Hacker / Phreaker: Hacking a "secure" wireless communication channel</a> </li></ul><br>  <b>GoTo Camp 2015 year</b> <br>  Reporting article on Habr√©: <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/261041/">‚ÄúChildren's camp: bisectoral-Pythagorean triangles, brain reprogramming, radar detector and breaking handcuffs‚Äù</a> <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Photos</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cde/2fa/23f/cde2fa23fc2949538cc5910579ac8b8c.jpg" alt="image"><br>  ‚ÄúMy friend left mathematics for business.

According to recently updated legislation, people whose profiles have more than 3,000 subscribers are equal to the media.  The topic of media influence on the masses is very interesting both from a scientific point of view and commercially.  The guys took up the study of these user-hubs: they found interesting information about profiles, found out the approximate ratio of the number of bots and real people, identified the prevailing types of content on their walls, tried to identify the signs that caused their popularity.  They showed that these users do post in most cases photos and audio recordings, and also have open profiles and receive messages from all users. <br><br>  Developing this idea, one can understand what the audience is interested in, subscribing to these people, finding out their hobbies, as well as influencing them.  The information obtained will allow you to engage in effective promotion of advertising, designed for specific groups of users in the network.  It is worth highlighting this project, because the guys are one of the few who took up a practical task and brought it to the stage of a working prototype with the possibility of future monetization of the service as an analog of Ya.Direkt and Google.Ads. <br><br>  <b>Team Map of connections</b> .  In this project, the guys took up a rather interesting study - the study of patterns of communication between students from different schools in Moscow.  The density of ties between students from different schools was investigated depending on the location and the presence of a matching profile of the schools being compared.  Graphs of connections between students were constructed and so-called connectivity components were obtained, showing how certain groups of schoolchildren are divided into circles of communication, as well as visualization of connections on the map of Moscow.  Such data can be used to improve the interaction of schools in various fields: from the Olympiad movement to sports and social activities. <br><br>  <b>Team 10011001</b> .  A team of students has developed an application that allows you to search for data dependencies automatically and not to build hypotheses manually.  With the help of this functional, they built correlations of various social features of the existing sample of schoolchildren on the social network VKontakte: the connection of their main interests, musical and literary preferences with gender differences, with nationality, lifestyle and many other characteristics.  The main value of their work is the ability to set any input data and get the most significant correlations that can be used to build the average attitude of the selected group of people to the topic of interest to us. <br><br>  [ <a href="https://tproger.ru/articles/goto-hack-results/">Source</a> ] <br></div></div><br>  <b>City camps</b> <br>  We spent several intensives (with severe immersion in the topic of machine learning) in the center of Moscow with accommodation in a hostel. <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Photos</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/806/d56/577/806d56577af72bc87c96a05a6e3b54b8.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Bobuk casts <s>trends</s> sanity <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bd8/21c/d8c/bd821cd8cd17c477baaf9b53a4de7cc4.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Let's play, we were allowed <br><br>  Pubs <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dfa/cfa/9d7/dfacfa9d789a494c913e9e354a9a4549.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b17/c29/720/b17c29720e4e7d089936e511fe2b4bb8.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9bc/030/f6f/9bc030f6f134e83c9c101b02d13b7f2c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/59d/b89/37d/59db8937db2c1383516d6da43ad89aa9.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b9f/2dc/984/b9f2dc9840aeb144ce70fc1893011c9f.jpg" alt="image"><br>  It seems to take adequate counselors <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/110/022/0de/1100220ded5ee95383122521da783ac0.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Get knowledge from books directly <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9db/538/83c/9db53883c7e74a94802c15be9933d8d3.jpg"><br>  Encapsulation <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6e6/1b6/1d3/6e61b61d3b0b1c5e8ae63c3d667af5d1.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Small, yes bold <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b01/fd7/3a4/b01fd73a4a31ed72382e3a214eb9ecd0.jpg" alt="image"><br>  I know kung fu <br><br></div></div><br><h4>  Thoughts of respected IT people about education </h4><br>  <b>Peter Thiel</b> <br>  <a href="https://esquire.ru/peter-thiel">"A drill"</a> <br>  Peter Thiel advises employers to hire more people without higher education, and high school graduates to think ten times before entering a university. <br><br>  <b>Paul graham</b> <br>  <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/262550/">‚ÄúWhat we wanted to know in school‚Äù</a> <br>  <i>‚ÄúI wrote this speech to address graduates of the school.</i>  <i>I was not able to speak with her because the school administration forbade me to invite me. ‚Äù</i> <br><br><h4>  Backstage </h4><br>  - Serge, what are we going to talk about? <br>  - I can tell you about how to burn smokeless powder so that your fingers do not tear off. <br>  - Ha, I can add the story of how we in childhood sawed a tank projectile in order to pick out the "Semidyr" from it. <br>  - I look at my friends and I don't care how miraculously everybody survived. <br>  - Can you tell about AI in games? <br>  - Let me better, I will potroll with their sotsinzhiniring. <br><br>  - Alena, I will not go anywhere until I find a camel, in order to get it for an article on Habr√©.
