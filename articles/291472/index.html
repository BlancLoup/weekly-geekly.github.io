But by chance I checked the work of one of the services on my client.  Moreover, this is a <a href="http://evldk.ru/">site</a> with a rather modest attendance and an ‚Äúold‚Äù design.

      I started by ordering a callback in several services (it was a holiday, in my opinion, on May 11): <br><ul><li>  <a href="http://callbackhunter.com/">Callbackhunter</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://chaser.ru/">Chaser</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://hookmyvisit.com/">HookMyVisit</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.leadhacker.ru/">Leadhacker</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://rocketcallback.com/">Rocketcallback</a> </li></ul><br>  The only one who called back - Chaser, and worked with him. <br><br>  There were no problems with the setting: I put 3 phones with switching after 8 seconds ‚Äúno answer‚Äù.  Most of the calls "fell" to the first number.  Chaser for 2 minutes trying to call managers, going through the numbers (you can set the sequence).  I decided to make testing hard: the form floated in time, with long inactivity, and always when trying to close the page, regardless of whether the widget was displayed to the user earlier or not. <br><br>  Appearance settings are not changed.  Took all the standard. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/100/df0/318/100df031865448a9816606d88c616152.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  There was one mistake with the first call - he did not warn the managers that they had put the service, as a result, the company employee did not wait for the site visitor to pick up the phone.  All the rest went without problems. <br><br>  Subjective moments of the type of influence on the conversion of site design will be set aside.  We believe that this is a common resource, of which there are many, and which the company seriously began to engage literally 2 months ago. <br><br><h2>  Some call statistics </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/146/ea1/277/146ea1277a6e43a8a8e6c31d540ab034.jpg"><br><br>  176 minutes, 24 calls, 1 month of work.  Only 2 times those who requested calls did not pick up the phone. <br><br>  12 out of 24 ordered a call when they were about to leave the site.  If you dig a little deeper, then we hooked 0.4% of these users.  By the way, the button conversion is even higher: 5.7%, because by closing the pop-up window, users themselves then looked for the opportunity to contact the manager and clicked on the button.  Conversions on other triggers - below. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6b0/ebf/2aa/6b0ebf2aa4a44f528b946cbd09ed338e.jpg"><br><br>  This is the question of "stiffness" - it works great!  Without any doubt, I myself am annoyed by such things, but if we are talking about a really expensive purchase - why not take advantage of a free consultation? <br><br>  The price per minute at the rate I use is 20 rubles (I‚Äôll note that the most unprofitable was taken for the test, so see the prices below for adequate).  In any case, whatever you use, count after 3-4 weeks the cost of the application.  In our case, since the calls are quite long (more than 6 minutes) it is almost 74 rubles.  So keep in mind that for a company that offers products and services with a relatively low cost, the use of such a service can be destructive. <br><br><h2>  A few words about the service and support </h2><br><ul><li>  Only they called back from their own form (although it was a day off) </li><li>  Set up and set in less than 15 minutes </li><li>  You can associate with analytics systems and specify a call, a widget display, etc. as targets.  - I did not see such an advanced set for analytics from anyone. </li><li>  In the statistics of the service itself there is an extended analytics: the source of the transition, the page from which the call was ordered, the utm-tags for analyzing advertising sources. </li><li>  I liked that there are no hard scenarios </li><li>  Very unobtrusive in terms of selling their services </li><li>  When it was necessary - quickly reached out to technical support and even the development department, I was not kicked from phone to phone </li><li>  At my request, for testing, they gave a bonus in the form of a free top-up balance. </li></ul><br><br><h2>  Cost comparison with industry leader </h2><br>  In general, Chaser costs 2 times cheaper than the popular Callbackhunter.  And support level.  How Callbackhunter works in terms of service, I can not say, did not use. <br>  <b>Chaser</b> <br><table><tbody><tr><td>  <b>Rate</b> </td><td>  <b>Number of calls</b> </td><td>  <b>Number of minutes</b> </td><td>  <b>Cost, rub.</b> </td><td>  <b>Cost per minute, rub.</b> </td><td>  <b>Call cost, rub.</b> </td></tr><tr><td>  Start </td><td>  22 </td><td>  50 </td><td>  990 </td><td>  20 </td><td>  46 </td></tr><tr><td>  Optimum </td><td>  109 </td><td>  250 </td><td>  2,990 </td><td>  12 </td><td>  28 </td></tr><tr><td>  Expert </td><td>  435 </td><td>  1,000 </td><td>  8,990 </td><td>  9 </td><td>  21 </td></tr></tbody></table><br>  <b>Callbackhunter</b> <br><table><tbody><tr><td>  <b>Rate</b> </td><td>  <b>Number of calls</b> </td><td>  <b>Number of minutes</b> </td><td>  <b>Cost, rub.</b> </td><td>  <b>Cost per minute, rub.</b> </td><td>  <b>Call cost, rub.</b> </td></tr><tr><td>  Wild cat </td><td>  34 </td><td>  78 </td><td>  3 350 </td><td>  43 </td><td>  99 </td></tr><tr><td>  Leopard </td><td>  150 </td><td>  345 </td><td>  13,550 </td><td>  39 </td><td>  90 </td></tr><tr><td>  Snow leopard </td><td>  503 </td><td>  1,157 </td><td>  43,650 </td><td>  38 </td><td>  87 </td></tr><tr><td>  VIP </td><td>  2,000 </td><td>  4,600 </td><td>  100,000 </td><td>  22 </td><td>  50 </td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><h2>  Nice buns in visitor statistics </h2><br>  Judging by the statistics in J. Metric, the behavior of the majority of those who called was: <br><ul><li>  The visitor came, the widget opened, he closed it; </li><li>  Walked through the site, called the widget and called </li><li>  I decided to change the tab or close the page - again display the widget </li></ul><br>  During the month of work, the failures somewhat decreased (although this may be entirely due to the fact that we are finishing the site at an accelerated pace) and the duration of the visits.  This will well influence the search engine ranking behavioral factors. <br><br><h2>  New ideas for the site and company </h2><br>  Such services are a great tool for controlling managers.  Not only statistics of unanswered calls are kept, but also conversations are recorded along with information about who took the call, from which city they called and how they got to the site. <br>  I myself listened to all the first calls and found an idea for filling the site.  One of the visitors was looking for a company that is ready to sell him the waste of glulam production.  We decided to place information on the conditions of sale of waste on the site in order to expand the circle of buyers. <br>  In general, a very good solution even for companies with a small audience. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/291472/">https://habr.com/ru/post/291472/</a></p>
