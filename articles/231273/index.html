Do not worry, we will refund your money!</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/254/58a/41b/25458a41b18d46beda99a71bf0a3f50f.jpg" alt=" " title="Leakage effects"><br><br>  Did it happen that your batteries "leaked" and spoiled the device in which they were located (approximately as shown in the photo above)?  I think that most likely yes.  And when I once again had a similar situation, I wondered what would happen if I wrote a complaint about this incident to this battery maker himself, since it‚Äôs easy to do so. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Prehistory </h4><br>  I had a mouse of one ‚Äúfruit‚Äù company, which lay, was used once a week and in general everything was not bad until July 14 of this year.  On that day, it was discovered that the mouse was not working, and there were some strange drips from below.  After removing the battery compartment lid, it was found that the batteries, which had been a month for strength, what is called ‚Äúleaked‚Äù.  Attempts to reanimate the unfortunate opening with nothing good were not crowned - even though the appearance was relatively restored, the mouse lost all functions except the left click (the touch panel failed).  The mouse was automatically assigned to the category of "garbage, but it is a pity to throw out."

Make it turned out to be easy.  On the Procter &amp; Gamble website, a <a href="http://www.pg.com/ru_RU/contacts.shtml">form</a> was found where you can complain about the quality of the product (the ‚ÄúReason of Appeal‚Äù item).  Filled out all the required information: contact details, information about the incident (where, among other things, indicated the market value of the mouse on the manufacturer's website - 2890 rubles), the batteries themselves, attached a photo of the consequences and waited for an answer. <br><br><h4>  Sudden answer </h4><br>  Two days later, an e-mail response came, which is very surprised. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">The text of the received letter</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><blockquote>  Dear Yuri, <br><br>  Thank you for contacting Procter and Gamble, from which we learned about the Duracell battery incident.  We are very sorry about that. <br><br>  In principle, you have already answered all the questions that we have to ask in this case (battery size, device type and model, battery production code, etc.), I‚Äôll just ask you to answer those questions that are not available in your original letter. : <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ In what condition is the battery now (it has fallen into pieces, intact, leaked). <br>  ‚Ä¢ Number of batteries used in the device <br>  ‚Ä¢ Place of production of batteries (indicated on the carton) <br>  ‚Ä¢ Where were the batteries purchased? <br><br>  In principle, the battery leakage could occur for the following reasons (I will list all possible, despite the fact that it is obvious that some of them do not apply to you): <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ The battery is placed in the device in the wrong way (the polarity of the installation is not observed). <br>  ‚Ä¢ Simultaneous use of the power cord and batteries in the device. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Attempting to recharge an alkaline battery. <br>  ‚Ä¢ The battery has been exposed to extreme temperatures (high or low) for a long time. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Batteries are stored in a damp place or at high humidity. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Use old and new batteries at the same time.  It is necessary to replace all the batteries in the devices at the same time. <br><br>  Upon receiving answers from you to the remaining questions, I will be ready to offer you compensation for the cost of the device (you have already indicated it) and the cost of used batteries (please specify).  Compensation will be sent to you by postal order. <br><br>  Respectfully, <br><br>  Galina Petrenko, <br>  Head of Consumer Services <br>  Procter &amp; Gamble in Eastern Europe and Central Asia </blockquote></div></div><br>  Key phrase: <blockquote>  Upon receiving answers from you to the remaining questions, I will be ready to offer you compensation for the cost of the device (you have already indicated it) and the cost of used batteries (please specify).  Compensation will be sent to you by postal order. </blockquote>  Yes, when I filled out the form on the site I was expecting some kind of reaction, perhaps compensating the cost of the batteries, but to get a compensation for the cost of the device?  Procter &amp; Gamble surprised me very much at that moment.  In return, I provided all the information that was requested from me and waited. <br><br><h4>  Success-story </h4><br>  A week later, in the mailbox, I found a notification about receiving a postal transfer.  The amount exceeded the value of the mouse and batteries indicated by me when handling (2890 and 120 rubles, respectively), amounting to 3300 rubles. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f8f/0e5/092/f8f0e50921d15b9a28885ea686812321.jpg"><br><br>  For all this, they did not ask me to send either a damaged mouse or leaking batteries.  Not even asked to send a photo of the check on the batteries or something like that.  I just sent a compensation.  This is the most amazing manifestation of the company's loyalty, which you can think of.  Yes, on Habr√© there were already stories about broken mice and new ones, received in exchange after the destruction of the old ones.  But to get compensation for a device that costs almost 30 times more expensive than the batteries themselves?  Procter &amp; Gamble deserved the fact that, despite this incident, I bought their batteries further. <br><br><h4>  PS </h4><br>  I don‚Äôt know how long this will last, because after the publication of this topic, the number of such appeals will undoubtedly increase and the company may offer only compensation for the cost of the batteries themselves, but so far this has not happened, I‚Äôm happy to share my experience.  Perhaps for someone this information will be useful. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/231273/">https://habr.com/ru/post/231273/</a></p>
