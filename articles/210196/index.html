      The company is currently working on one of these projects.  It is named Retro Rush, and it features six games released for PlayStation 3, PS Vita and PSP for six weeks. <br><br>  The Retro Rush series includes the games <i>Double Drdagon</i> , <i>Hyper Crazy Climber</i> , <i>Wolf Fang</i> , <i>Lucifer Ring</i> , <i>The Firemen 2:</i> <i>Pete and Danny</i> and <i>Tomba!</i>  <i>2</i> <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z_GrppIovp8%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhhjLlpPn3_v03OiOkvZyswbM9N_VA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  We were able to talk with MonkeyPaw‚Äôs public relations manager Ryan Olsen about the company's love of the history of games, their development, decision-making principles, and how these games are transferred to modern platforms. <br><br><h4>  Love for the "oldies" </h4><br>  ‚ÄúHistory is an integral part of video games,‚Äù notes Olsen. <br><br>  As far as we know, MonkeyPaw is engaged in history.  She takes the games that are gradually becoming a thing of the past and brings them to the modern gaming market.  Of course, an important incentive for this is to make a profit, but not only - the company does its business for the love of preserving the past. <br><br>  ‚ÄúAny games evolve, and video games are no exception.  The elements and ‚ÄúDNAs‚Äù that underlie modern shooters or, for example, adventure games, often lie in classic games. ‚Äù  MonkeyPaw facilitates the tracing of these evolutionary chains and, more importantly, the return of the games of which they are composed. <br><br>  There are so many people in the world who want to play classic Japanese games - perhaps even for the first time in their lives.  The eighties and nineties were the years of rapid growth in game production in Japan, leaving a rich legacy that is simply inaccessible to western audiences. <br>  Olsen sees the goal of MonkeyPaw‚Äôs work right in eliminating this gap.  ‚ÄúFor us, MonkeyPaw is a bridge between games of the West and the East.  We enable people from all over the world to play games that have stopped their evolution in Japan. ‚Äù <br><br>  But how to decide which games will be of interest to the whole world?  Olsen believes that the main factor here is the wishes of the fans.  ‚ÄúOur fans are almost the most faithful in the world, because they fully share our passion for classic games.  Projects like Retro Rush would not have been possible without players sharing our feelings.  We always say that nothing is impossible when so many people support you, and this is true. ‚Äù <br><br>  MonkeyPaw always listens to the wishes of the fans and in almost all acts in accordance with them. <br><br>  However, the decision-making process, of course, goes beyond this factor.  Olsen asks: "Is this game interesting?", "Is this genre interesting to people?", "Is there anything unusual or crazy in it?" <br><br>  ‚ÄúIf at least one of these questions is answered positively, we are considering the option of releasing such a game.  We have high quality requirements for games.  The mere fact that a game ever existed is not enough.  If it meets these requirements, then it is necessary to obtain a license for its international release. ‚Äù  According to Olsen, this is not easy: ‚ÄúIn Japan, it is incredibly difficult to break through.  Here you need to persist for a long time and persistently before you are told ‚Äúyes.‚Äù <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/dFKIF_QIKJ0%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhgRieDyyzmub1hwGaBahgJPEeEupg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h4>  It's all about our fans </h4><br>  The technical possibilities of emulation are certainly important for the release of the game, but the opinion of the fans is still crucial.  Contracting and emulation is later. <br><br>  The opinion of the fans is so weighty that the company does not even have to make a list of games. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe games that fans celebrate also appeal to us,‚Äù says Olsen.  - It is on this principle that we recreate the classics.  The passion and enthusiasm of the players gives us strength in those difficult periods when we often have to refuse at meetings on licensing before the game is approved. ‚Äù <br><br>  If MonkeyPaw‚Äôs staff members are stuck in a game, they will not rest until they release it.  The release of the game Tomba!  was held in October 2012.  The whole year was required only to get permission for its release.  Tomba!  2 also did not become an exception. <br>  ‚ÄúOur motto is to never give up.  Never give up at all, ‚ÄùOlsen says confidently.  Thanks to this we managed to release Tomba!  2. We have already announced the release of this game a long time ago, but obstacles began to appear one after another.  As a result, spending on the conclusion of the transaction almost as much time as the game Tomba !, the company still achieved permission to release the Japanese game on the US market. <br><br>  The main work of MonkeyPaw on each game is to work successfully on modern devices. <br><br>  ‚ÄúWhen preparing for export, we try to implement a smooth emulation process,‚Äù says Olsen.  After the fans choose the game and get the license, seamless emulation is the most difficult task. <br><br>  The company was greatly helped by the experience of emulating games for Sony devices. <br><br>  ‚ÄúSony turned out to be a wonderful partner, and without its help we would not be able to release games like Tomba!‚Äù Says Olsen. <br><br>  RPG games are usually very good for MonkeyPaw.  "RPG and shooters are the most successful genres for us."  But this does not mean that MonkeyPaw is only interested in these genres.  Olsen says his company gives a second wind to all types and styles of games that fans want.  "We are given the name of the game, and we are doing everything possible so that it can be downloaded." <br><br>  In fact, all MonkeyPaw activities can be reduced to a single principle: "With the help of fans."  The company seems to exist solely so that players can get more pleasure from the games. <br><br>  ‚ÄúOur job is to transfer your favorite games to modern consoles,‚Äù says Olsen.  ‚ÄúWe want to be that very bridge between East and West, and projects like Retro Rush help us with that.‚Äù <br><br>  I can't wait to see what these guys have prepared for us, because there are so many good old games left in Japan! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/210196/">https://habr.com/ru/post/210196/</a></p>
