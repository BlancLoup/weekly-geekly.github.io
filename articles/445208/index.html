Organizations understand how to optimize the IT infrastructure and how important it is to be economically efficient, they come to the need to rationalize the infrastructure of their enterprise using standardization of desktop computers, consolidation of data processing centers, as well as the introduction of operating experience of information technologies.  If we take these initiatives separately, they do not have a lasting effect at all.  To achieve a long-term effect, it is necessary to clearly understand the maturity levels of your IT infrastructure, its relationship to the overall business strategy and its needs. <br><br>  Microsoft offers its <u>IOM infrastructure optimization model</u> (stands for Infrastructure Optimization Model).  This model is designed to help enterprises understand and improve the state of their own IT infrastructure, moreover, it contributes to a clearer idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhat costs are expected in the future to optimize, what is its flexibility in operation and what is the level of security.  Significantly possible savings due to the transition to a dynamic environment from unmanaged.  The level of security rises to proactively counter threats to higher levels of maturity.  Similarly, IT infrastructure management can be improved: the entire list of operations that need to be performed is done not in manual mode, but at a high level of automation with work ahead of schedule, in order to avoid similar problems in the future. <br><br>  By purchasing and using the optimization model from Microsoft, the customer is rapidly beginning to understand the full benefits of the strategy, as well as the business benefits of moving from a basic level to a dynamic level of maturity of the IT infrastructure.  At first, it is considered an item of expenditure, and after the transition, its value to the business becomes clear and it is perceived as a strategic asset that contributes to the effective management of the business. <br>  Creating a model of optimizing the IT infrastructure by Microsoft is based on the industry and the company itself accumulated over many years, as well as the successful application of this experience in practice.  This model is based on the Gartner IMM IT infrastructure maturity model and the MIT AMM maturity model.

      The main goal laid at the beginning when developing the IT infrastructure optimization model from Microsoft was to find a flexible and simple way to use the model, which would later be simply implemented as a benchmark to determine the technical capabilities of the IT infrastructure and its value to the business. <br><br>  The first step in applying this model in practice will be an assessment of the level of maturity of the company's IT infrastructure in terms of this model, the next step will be planning the development of infrastructure that will ensure the achievement of the required level of maturity. <br><br><h3>  Basic </h3><br>  The IT infrastructure of a basic level of maturity is characterized by a multitude of processes that are carried out manually, minimal centralization of management, and lack of thought or lack of policies and standards for infrastructure security, image management systems, backup, and non-compliance with other information technology standards.  The company does not clearly understand the details of the existing IT infrastructure, there is no knowledge of the tactics of its modernization, which could give the maximum effect.  The health of services and applications and services is generally unknown due to the lack of suitable tools and resources.  There is no mechanism for the exchange of accumulated knowledge between the structural divisions of the organization.  Organizations that have a basic IT infrastructure are in a difficult situation and cannot manage their environments, server and PC management costs are extremely high, vulnerability to any attacks and threats becomes high, and as a result business suffers, receiving little benefit from information technologies.  Any deployment or upgrade of services or applications in this case will require large expenditures and efforts.  However, organizations that are at the basic level of maturity of the IT infrastructure benefit greatly by making the transition to a standardized level (Standardized) of maturity, actually reducing costs by: <br><br><ul><li>  reduce the risks associated with security, through the implementation of echeloned defense (an approach characterized by providing security at several levels: at the server level, applications, PC and around the perimeter of the network); <br></li><li>  introducing an automatic instead of a manual and long-running operation; <br></li><li>  implementation of best practices (various IT libraries: Infrastructure Library, SANS and others); <br></li><li>  development of policies and standards and strategies for their application. <br></li></ul><br><h3>  Standardized level of maturity (Standardized) </h3><br>  Well-defined management points are beginning to emerge in the standardized IT infrastructure through the application of policies and standards for server and stationary PC administration, rules for connecting a PC to the network, resource management based on Active Directory, security policies and access control.  Enterprises with a standardized IT infrastructure of the maturity level are already effectively applying all the best basic policies and standards, but are still responding to problems only when they are already in place.  Deploying and upgrading new services / applications usually incurs costs and expenses within acceptable limits, but sometimes costs still remain high.  As a rule, in such a company there is some intelligible inventory database of hardware and software, and the management of licenses begins.  By blocking the perimeter of the network, protection against external threats increases, but internal security is low.  Enterprises with a standardized level of maturity of the IT infrastructure always benefit from the transition to a rationalized level, while acquiring the highest control over the entire IT infrastructure, as well as processes and policies aimed at proactively responding to various kinds of situations, ranging from natural disasters to ending changes in market conditions. <br><br><h3>  Rationalized maturity level </h3><br>  This level of maturity of the organization's IT infrastructure is characterized by minimal costs for managing servers and desktops; policies and processes are becoming important in expanding and supporting a business.  The key attention in the protection is paid to preventive measures, the company predictably and quickly responds to any kind of security threat.  Using a Zero touch deployment (fully automated deployment, with minimal operator involvement) reduces costs, as well as the time to install updates and the likelihood of technical problems.  The number of system images (images) is minimal, and the process of managing stationary computers requires little effort.  The company creates a database that has comprehensive information about the hardware and software.  As a result, the purchase of new computer equipment and software licenses is carried out on a targeted basis, without unnecessary costs.  Having reached a dynamic level of maturity, an IT infrastructure with a rationalized level provides businesses with a large number of bonuses: an enterprise is able to introduce alternative and new technologies required for the implementation of new goals and business objectives, while the gain significantly exceeds additional costs. <br><br><h3>  Dynamic level of maturity </h3><br>  In an organization with an IT infrastructure that has reached a dynamic level of maturity, there is a full understanding of the strategic value of this infrastructure, which contributes to the effective management of the business and the constant advance of competitors.  All expenses are fully controlled, the data necessary for their work is available to users, on whatever servers they are located, there is also a well and effectively organized collaboration both at the employee level and at the level of structural departments, almost the same service is available to mobile users, as in the office.  Processes become fully automated and regularly incorporated directly into IT systems; this allows you to manage these systems in accordance with business needs.  Quick and predictable returns for businesses come from additional technology investments.  The use of quarantine-like systems and self-provisioning software to ensure that updates are properly managed and that security policies are in place allows enterprises with a dynamic level of IT infrastructure maturity to automate processes, increasing their reliability.  This format helps reduce costs and maximize service levels.  Enterprises with such a level of maturity of IT infrastructures can respond to any challenge of modern business. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/445208/">https://habr.com/ru/post/445208/</a></p>
