You also already know that if you need to interest your audience, then you need to create really valuable content. <br>  I apologize for the specialized content marketing words used in the text, but everyone will probably agree that ‚Äúunderstanding that content is important‚Äù does not provide a marketing strategy.  This is obvious to everyone. <br>  <b>If you want your work to bring you a profit, then you need a thoughtful, data-based content marketing strategy.</b> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  As Arjun Bazu comments on many posts: <br><blockquote>  Content without strategy costs nothing. </blockquote><br>  If you are an intelligent marketer, then you are unlikely to be satisfied with the fact that ‚Äúit costs nothing‚Äù. <br><br>  This year, employees of the marketing company Unbounce re-read countless interesting and provocative blog posts.  These posts forced them to rethink their content strategy.  And in this article are eleven best options that can help you enter the new year with updated content marketing.

      Here are articles that will help you develop a content-based content marketing strategy. <br><br>  <b>1. <a href="http://unbounce.com/conversion-rate-optimization/why-you-should-focus-on-getting-clicks-before-conversions/">Why you should focus on clicks before proceeding to the conversion</a> .</b>  <b>The author is Tommy Walker from Unbounce.</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/97b/0a3/606/97b0a3606afb45eeb0c1cb1224d9ef2d.png" alt="image"><br><br>  When working on optimizing the conversion requirements, it is easy to forget that other parameters are just as important - especially when it comes to content marketing.  In this post, Tommy Walker calls to pay attention to clicks.  Here is what he says: <br><br><blockquote>  Once we understand what motivates people to click, we will understand why they go to the page. </blockquote><br>  In this article, Volker explains that clicks are a kind of ‚Äúnetwork currency‚Äù; he analyzes what provokes people to take this action, from examining the ‚Äúecosystem‚Äù of various distribution channels to the in-depth understanding of the most important data. <br>  If you want to understand how your audience clicks, this resource will be extremely useful to you. <br><br>  <b>2. <a href="http://www.curata.com/blog/the-comprehensive-guide-to-content-marketing-analytics-metrics/">Guide to analyzing data in content marketing.</a></b>  <b>The author is Pavan Deshpande of Curata.</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0cc/bf2/43a/0ccbf243a3434059908331e65f8fabf6.png" alt="image"><br><br>  If someone tells you that it is difficult to measure the effectiveness of content marketing, advise him to read the post of Pavan Deshpande from Curata <br>  In his post, Pavan Deshpande examines such metrics by default as ‚Äúthe number of page views‚Äù or ‚Äúthe number of people who share the link‚Äù, and also analyzes advanced metrics in detail and technically. <br><br>  Based on a key indicator of the performance of your business, this post will help you understand how to track and optimize this indicator (here you will also find tips from professional marketers who have already managed to achieve their goal). <br><br>  After reading this post, you will be ready to evaluate the effectiveness of your content and understand how it affects your bottom line. <br><br>  <b>3. <a href="https://blog.bufferapp.com/content-audit">What we learned by analyzing 595 posts Buffer</a> .</b>  <b>The author is Kevin Lee.</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/858/345/f6f/858345f6f59d466fa21afef4e209cc0c.png" alt="image"><br><br>  If you want to review your content strategy, then perhaps the most logical first step would be to look back and critically evaluate what was done (and what was not). <br>  From his post, Kevin Lee of Buffer reviews the specific content features of recent 595 posts.  He shares the main conclusions and detailed step-by-step instructions on how to do the same in his own blog. <br>  Like most Buffer posts, this article will provide you with an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe nature of the issue, based on specific information that will help you write your own post. <br><br>  <b>4. <a href="http://unbounce.com/content-marketing/how-to-optimize-your-old-blog-content-for-long-tail-conversion">How to optimize your old blog content for</a></b> long tail <b><a href="http://unbounce.com/content-marketing/how-to-optimize-your-old-blog-content-for-long-tail-conversion">conversion</a></b> (‚ÄúLong Tail‚Äù put into circulation Wred Editor Chris Anderson in The Long Tail article to describe successful business models for the Internet).  The author is David Cheng from Unbounce. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/525/dd2/08a/525dd208aa1446f981f3effad2d4ffa9.png" alt="image"><br><br>  You have already managed to check your content, but that's not all. <br>  Next, you will need to process the information received, formulate an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe effectiveness of this content and change your posts accordingly. <br><br>  As David Cheng of ShareBloc explains in his post, there are many simple ways to optimize old content and thus get quite tangible benefits - especially if you have content audit data. <br><br>  Cheng shares a few simple, but truly effective tactics to optimize your non-losing content in order to achieve high conversion (read-light profit). <br>  Articles help you masterfully promote your content. <br><br>  <b>5. <a href="http://www.buzzstream.com/blog/content-promotion-campaign-plan.html">How to create a brilliant content promotion plan</a> .</b>  <b>Author - Stephanie Bidel from BuzzStream.</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/86c/acd/6b3/86cacd6b3988411dbca556125a6cedaa.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Now that you have a method for creating content based on accurate data, you will undoubtedly create amazing resources that your audience will love.  But where to start? <br><br>  In his post on BuzzStream, content marketer Stephanie Bidell explains that promotion should not be something secondary, set aside for later.  It should occur in parallel with the creation of content, so that most of the work on its promotion was done before publication. <br><br>  Beadell shares information about the work schedule, when and what should fall into place: audience research, messaging, testing, support, moderation and shutdown. <br>  It also provides readers with a detailed ‚Äúcheat sheet‚Äù of the content promotion campaign plan, which is very convenient. <br><br>  <b>6. <a href="https://www.groovehq.com/blog/guest-blogging">How we scored more than one million people guest blogging</a> .</b>  <b>Author - Alex Turnbull from Groove.</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b58/7d7/ea0/b587d7ea0db74f2ab4e1b470392a0004.png" alt="image"><br><br>  If you have ever heard that guest posting is an important element of the strategy, then this post will really help you to deal with this issue. <br><br>  Groove's Alex Turnbull begins his post by sharing statistics on how guest posting influenced the overall performance of his company. <br><br>  Immediately after this, Turnbull proceeds to a detailed review of guest posting: how to choose a topic that will resonate with the audience, and how to masterfully convey the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãyour post. <br><br>  To top it all, he explains how Groove uses a combination of guest posting and specialized landing pages (landing page) to see the actual results of its efforts to create guest posting in order to get more leads (potential customers) and increase conversion. <br><br>  Continuation - <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/witget/blog/247443/">follows</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/247317/">https://habr.com/ru/post/247317/</a></p>
