Hitler betting facilities</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><h4>  Good time of day, dear habrazhiteli </h4><br>  I bring to your attention the material on underground strategic structures.  The first article is devoted to underground structures of the Second World War, built by Hitler. <br><br><h5>  So let's get started ... </h5><br>  Tormented by delusions of grandeur, Adolf Hitler dreamed of controlling the world from inaccessible places: either from mountain heights, for example, in the castle "Eagle's Nest" in Obersalzberg, or from beneath the underground bunkers Maybach, Werewolf or Berenhel.  However, it‚Äôs not only the Fuhrer‚Äôs perverted aesthetic tastes that matter: German underground objects, like others - British, American or Russian, had a strategic purpose ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In 1936, 2.5 km south of the small German town of Zossen, construction work began, the essence of which was carefully hidden not only from the local population, but also from the builders themselves.  Officially, they built just a big training camp.  Indeed, on the territory of about 200 hectares 156 one- and two-storey houses have grown.  And the remaining floors, ranging from 2 to 7, are located underground.  This is how the Maybach complex came about. <br><br>  The shock pace of penetration, installation and finishing allowed in a few years to instill there the tenants - officers of the General Staff of the German Army headed by Colonel-General Franz Halder.  In 1940, he conducted secret negotiations here with the chief of staff of the Finnish army, General Heinriks, about the interaction of German units stationed in Norway with the Finnish in the war against the USSR.  It was in Zossena that the infamous Barbarossa plan was finally clarified and finally brought to mind.

      During the war, the Maybach consisted of numerous subunits, built on a single plan. <br><br><img src="http://img101.imageshack.us/img101/3555/31594683.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <b>The layout of the underground complex "Maybach"</b> <br><br>  Maybach-1 included the command post itself (KP), a communications center, 12 cigars of conical bomb shelters, 18 m deep and designed for 350 people, and a shelter with rooms surrounded by 12 two-storey bunkers.  The latter were located under the so-called working buildings - houses in the typical German spirit in two floors, the peaked roof.  Here lived staff officers with service personnel.  Downstairs there were cabinets equipped with filtering units.  The corps had code names A-1, A-2, etc.  They stood around a ring-shaped concrete road, ‚Äúduplicated‚Äù by a tunnel at a depth of 6‚Äì8 m - which in a similar way connected mini-bunkers between themselves.  In one place (between A-3 and A-4), an axial tunnel led away from it to the communications center, recessed by about 10-15 meters. Communication was maintained not only with the whole of Europe (partially friendly, partially conquered), but even with Africa, where Erwin Rommel, the ‚Äúdesert fox,‚Äù showed the mediocre generals Mussolini how to fight ... <br><br>  The same axial tunnel, going beyond the communications hub, turned off to the northeast and gradually rose and terminated in the basement of one of the houses of a tiny village.  This entry was used by high-ranking officials who did not want to attract undue attention.  With him, through the tunnel, government cars within a minute reached the borders of the Maybach - more precisely, one of the buildings in the territory where the cargo lift for two cars was equipped.  The trunk went six floors down: on the minus fifth - the garage, the rest was occupied by the library, the dispensary, the dining room, the cinema hall.  Maybach-2, located south-east of the main object, differed from it only by the absence of a communications center and also by the fact that there were 11 working buildings with two-storey bunkers. They housed technical services and security. <br><br>  After the defeat of fascist Germany, Maybach was inherited by the Soviet winners.  But they ordered their trophy to be extremely unfriendly: they blew up something, walled up something and fell asleep.  Only years later, a small part of the complex was restored.  She was given the name "Third Town", equipped, re-classified and made the command center of the Soviet contingent in the GDR.  As such, the object served until 1994 - until the withdrawal of the Western Group of Forces. <br><br>  What is the fate of "Maybach", partially surviving underground strategic complex of the military and the postwar period - is not known.  Perhaps it will become a military museum. <br><br>  After a successful start of hostilities on the Eastern Front, the Hitlerite command decided to bring the stakes closer to the scene of the hostilities.  Its construction was planned near Lubin in the Poltava region.  But the defeat of the Nazis near Moscow and the actions of the partisans, forced to move it to a "quiet place" - Vinnitsa. <br><br>  At the end of 1941 in the forest near the village of Strizhenovka near Vinnitsa, construction began on one of Hitler‚Äôs largest underground rates - the ‚ÄúWerewolf bunker‚Äù.  This object was named after the construction was completed in December 1943. The first stage was completed in April 1942 and was called the ‚ÄúArmed Wolf‚Äù or ‚ÄúWerewolf‚Äù.  The work was supervised by the German construction company Todt.  Many companies and specialists from Germany, Holland, Czechoslovakia participated. <br><br>  ‚ÄúWerewolf‚Äù was built at a very fast pace: the document of April 10, 1942 already reported the completion of the main works.  According to this source, 4,086 people worked at the construction site at the time, including 991 German citizens, 1,425 foreigners, about 500 construction battalion soldiers and 1,100 prisoners of war. <br><br>  Underground structures included bomb shelters - reinforced concrete, massive structures.  The form of bomb shelters - box.  The foundations are solid reinforced concrete, the floor thickness is 4.5 m, the wall thickness is 2.5-3 m. The location depth is 20 m. On top of the floor was a layer of earth and bushes and trees (pines) were planted for masking.  The sizes of the bunkers were: the first - 7x17 m, the second - 8x11 m and the personal Hitler's - 8.5x8.5 m. The topography of the central part of the ‚ÄúWerewolf‚Äù is presented below. <br><br><img src="http://img406.imageshack.us/img406/7295/21307617.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <b>Topography of the central part of the strategic object "Werewolf"</b> <br>  <i>1 - swimming pool;</i>  <i>2 - the secretariat;</i>  <i>3 - press center;</i>  <i>4 - hairdresser;</i>  <i>5 - room for the servants;</i>  <i>6 - communication center;</i>  <i>7 - adjutant;</i>  <i>8 - dining rooms;</i>  <i>9 - sauna and gym;</i>  <i>10 - the house of Bormann;</i>  <i>11 - Hitler's house and bunker;</i>  <i>12 - ‚Äúcommon‚Äù bunker;</i>  <i>13 - security service;</i>  <i>14-16 - houses of the General Staff</i> <br><br>  Despite the capital and massiveness of underground structures, the object ‚ÄúWerewolf‚Äù (‚ÄúWerewolf‚Äù) corresponded to its name, it looked transparent - several buildings painted green with disguise, in particular, the Fuhrer‚Äôs brick house, with the same purpose lined with logs, but inside it was a miracle of engineering and fortification technology.  Three reinforced concrete bomb shelters. <br><br>  On the north side under the forest is a power station.  Nearby are two radio stations, a water station, a telephone hub, providing direct communication with Berlin, Kiev, Rostov, Kharkov, Dnepropetrovsk, and Zhytomyr.  Next to the rate - landing pad for connected aircraft.  Another airfield nearby, in Kalinovka;  near him the headquarters of Goering, also with a bunker.  The whole territory is enclosed by a thick steel mesh with a height of 2 m, per meter sunk into the ground, and several rows of barbed wire through which a high voltage current is passed.  Around - 36 observation towers.  An armored train runs along the Kalinovka-Vinnytsia railway line constantly.  In the barracks nearby - SS troops.  In the forest and on the roads every 200 m - secret spetszastavy.  And, of course, a special mode.  Outsiders, who learned about the rate, are subject to immediate execution, for which the special forces of the SD under the command of Untersturmf√ºhrer SS Danner are vigilant.  The latter has repeatedly received awards Reichsfuhrer for punitive activity. <br><br>  The special unit of the ‚ÄúGreat Germany‚Äù division, officially named the ‚ÄúFuhrer escort battalion‚Äù, directly guarded the headquarters.  At the end of December 1941, the security group ‚ÄúOst‚Äù also arrived in ‚ÄúWerewolf‚Äù, reporting directly to the head of the state security service at the rate of the SS supervisor Hans Rattenhuber, and immediately began to clear the area of ‚Äã‚Äã‚Äúsuspicious persons‚Äù.  In a report dated 08/14/1942, it was noted that for the period from 12/15/1941, 151 party activists, including 6 political commissars, were arrested and "transferred ... to the Vinnitsa security police".  And for the sake of the ‚Äúprevention‚Äù of the partisan movement, they decided to evict 58,000 Ukrainians and relocate 12-14 thousand Volksdeutsch - people of German origin to their place;  Fortunately, this event did not take place. <br><br>  Construction work at headquarters, interrupted in April 1942, resumed in the autumn of the same year and continued until the autumn of 1943, whence it is clear that the Germans had not even come to terms with their defeats on the fronts.  And the status of ‚ÄúWerewolf‚Äù was considered not only as a control point for the summer offensive on the Eastern Front in 1942, but also considered its main purpose - as a center for directing further military operations in the direction of Iran and India [9]. <br><br>  Bet ‚ÄúWerewolf‚Äù Hitler visited repeatedly.  He first arrived there on July 16, 1942, in order to be closer to the troops, who had begun a grand summer offensive on the East on July 28.  Together with Hitler, the headquarters of the ground forces moved to Vinnitsa.  Here, the F√ºhrer signed an important directive on the seizure of the Black Sea coast of the Caucasus and Stalingrad and the subsequent offensive against Baku.  As is known, thanks to the heroism of the Soviet troops, it was not executed. <br><br>  From September 27 to October 4, 1942, Hitler was in Berlin, and on October 5 he returned to the Werewolf, where on October 14 he signed an order on the transition to strategic defense on the Eastern Front.  October 31, he went to East Prussia, in "Wolfschance."  For the third time, Hitler visited the ‚ÄúWerwolf‚Äù from February 2 to March 13, 1943 - after that he held a large meeting in Zaporozhye on the question of a counteroffensive on Kharkov, recently taken by the Red Army. <br><br>  In August 1943, Soviet troops began to liberate the Donbass.  To discuss the catastrophic situation, Hitler on August 27, 1943, conferred in "Werewolf" with Field-Marshal-General Erikh von Manstein, the commander of Army Group South.  This was the Fuhrer's last visit to the field camp near Vinnitsa. <br><br>  The fate of "Werewolf" was decided on December 28, 1943, when Hitler ordered him to be destroyed.  Order diligently executed in March 1944. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe Germans used aerial bombs as charges of explosives when destroying constructions by Hitler‚Äôs stakes ... It can be assumed that the amount of explosives charges reached several tons.  So, for example, a piece of reinforced concrete measuring 8x5x2,80 (110) cubic meters, weighing about 200 tons, was blown away by a force of 60 meters to the extent of the explosion. ‚Äù <br><br>  The destruction of this underground structure of Hitler‚Äôs headquarters began at the end of 1942 by Soviet aviation.  Thus, during the decisive battles of the Battle of Stalingrad, dozens of bombers, accompanied by a powerful escort of fighters, wave after wave destroyed the objects of this Fuhrer headquarters, turning them into a pile of ruins.  But only the first three tiers of the stakes to a depth of 10 m were destroyed. The main premises remained unbroken.  After the liberation of Vinnitsa by the Soviet troops, a special task force of the USSR NKGB inspected the ‚ÄúWerewolf‚Äù and in the ‚ÄúInformation on the results of the survey of the former Hitler‚Äôs headquarters ...‚Äù noted that the remains of 81 burned buildings and three blasted bunkers were found on its territory.  According to Help, almost all land buildings are wooden with wooden roofs;  there were several fire columns near each;  The sewage pipes from the buildings went out into the canal that led to the filtering facilities near the water pumping station on the coast of the Southern Bug. <br><br>  Today, ‚ÄúWerewolf‚Äù is not much left.  But the veil of secrecy around the rate of Hitler near Vinnitsa remains to this day.  So, images of the terrain from space discovered an underground high-rise building measuring 300x700 m. Secrets did not disappear even after the expedition of Professor L.Z.  Bobrovnikov, whose studies suggest that, at a minimum, underground casemates were covered with 6 m of sand and located in granite.  Later, in one of the 1992 interviews, Bobrovnikov turned the rate into a three-tiered structure: the first tier ‚Äî above ground, the second, up to 8 m deep, includes service and defensive premises, the third ‚Äî up to 50 m underground ‚Äî is made up of high-rise bunkers and tunnels, where narrow gauge railway once cruised battery trains. <br><br>  In 1990, the Lodzhevsky expedition, using the latest equipment, found at a depth of 20 m, under 10 m of granite, about 70 premises of the former rate of several thousand cubic meters. <br><br>  It is likely that in order to dispel all secrets and conjectures about the ‚ÄúWerwolf‚Äù it is necessary to penetrate into the true secrets of the bet - and thus have access to the archives of Russia, Ukraine, Germany and other countries on this issue. <br><br>  On the underground structures of the rates of Hitler "Bear Den" (Berenhel) in Red Bor near Smolensk, perhaps less information than any other. <br><br><img src="http://img260.imageshack.us/img260/8197/91483829.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <b>Location (marked by a circle) of the Berenkhol underground complex in the vicinity of</b>  <b>Gnezdovo Smolensk region</b> <br><br>  It is known that in the central bunker at a depth of 30 m there was a meeting room and there is irrefutable evidence that the rate system consisted of ten more bunkers, a field airfield and two tunnels 1.5 km long each - from the conference hall to the airfield and the Dnieper.  Thus, the underground structures of the Bear Den are an extremely large-scale object and technically very difficult.  The construction was carried out by the German firm Todt, and the auxiliary works were carried out by several thousand prisoners of war, who were destroyed or taken away in an unknown direction upon completion of the work.  The construction of this secret facility began in the fall of 1941 and, according to the "Report on the activities of the Berenhel Special Team", in August 1942 was still ongoing.  It is known that the underground facilities of the Bear Den complex served as headquarters for Field Marshal Kluge (commander of the Center group), and Hitler only visited there twice.  The circumstances of his brief visits to this day are not made public.  In addition to one, the last in March 1943, the famous unsuccessful attempt on the Fuhrer. <br><br>  After the liberation of the city of Smolensk, a special engineering team carefully concreted many entrances, welded metal hatches, removed powerful energy and telephone cables, surviving equipment, and tightly caulked the Fuhrer's den. <br><br>  According to the testimony of military memoirists, the engineers did not act arbitrarily, but followed the ‚Äúsuperior‚Äù instructions, since  in the Red Bor near Smolensk can be kept the great secret of the second world war. <br><br>  Mysterious objects are underground structures in the north-west of Poland in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe city of Menzizhec (the German transcription of Meseritz), located in the vicinity of Kenshitsky Lake.  The German garrison was located in this area during the war. <br><br>  In 1945, during the offensive of the Soviet troops, when it became clear to the Germans that their garrison (two regiments, the school of the SS Division ‚ÄúDead Head‚Äù and part of the support) was in danger of being surrounded, he ... disappeared.  That is, did not retreat, but just disappeared!  True, he had nowhere to retreat in the most decisive way: the only way was captured by the Guards tankers.  And the garrison, defending Mezeritz, had sunk into the water.  Or is it better to say - fell through the earth? .. <br><br>  From 1945, the territory adjacent to the village of Kenshitsa was under the supervision of the Security Directorate of Menziczcz and the commander of a Polish artillery regiment stationed nearby.  In the late 50s, the former German military camp was temporarily handed over to the Soviet communications brigade.  Its command, in accordance with the rules of quartering the troops, conducted a thorough engineering survey of the area.  The results were slightly discouraged.  For a start, near the lake, in a reinforced concrete box, an insulated output of an underground power cable was found - instrumental measurements on its veins showed a current of 380 V. Then they came across a concrete well, into which water flowed out from nowhere, and yet it did not overflow. .  There was also information that the lake somehow communicates with the surrounding water bodies, of which there are many.  Doesn't everything listed suggest an underground power station whose turbines are rotated by water falling into the well?  Unfortunately, the sappers could not get an answer. <br><br>  In the early 60s.  For the first time, Kenshitsu was visited by the military prosecutor Alexander Liskin, now a retired colonel of justice.  His memoirs are published in the first volume of the book "Secrets of Millennia" (Moscow, Vokrug Sveta Publishing House, 1996).  Officers of the brigade showed Liskina on the eastern shore of the lake several powerful hills-heaps with secret manholes.  One of them and several gray concrete domes, similar to pillboxes, turned out to be disguised entrances to a spacious and unknown where the leaving tunnel.  Then: in the middle of the lake there was an island, which, as the guards noticed by chance, drifting slowly, as if standing at anchor.  Finally, once in clear weather in the east, deeper (up to 20 m), parts of the reservoir at the bottom saw something frighteningly similar to the eye.  Looking closer, the soldiers realized that they were seeing a huge hatch.  Shouldn't it have been covered by a floating island during air raids?  And what is he like?  Most likely, this is Kingston for emergency filling ... of what?  And, if it is intact, and not disturbed, apparently flooding did not take place? <br><br>  Farther.  From the south-west the lake has an appendix of clearly artificial origin, only 2-3 m deep. In its center there is a gloomy reinforced concrete tower resembling an air intake of the Moscow metro ... <br><br>        ,      1958  1992 .   :     ‚Äì   ,        .   ,  - ,     , ,     .   :     50    ,     ,      .  ‚Äì  .    ‚Äì   ,  ,            . <br><br>      ‚Äì  ..  ‚Äì ,    terra incognita       ,   . ,    90,       ‚Ä¶     ,    40- ‚Äì 50-        .  ,        1927-,  -       .  1937-,  ,           .    ¬´  ¬ª (Regenwurmlager       )       .        ,  ,      . <br><br>  ,       .    -  ,  ,  .  ,        ,      :       ?  ,    .           . <br><br>     ,  : <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/popular_science/88685/"> ¬´ ¬ª </a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/88488/">https://habr.com/ru/post/88488/</a></p>
