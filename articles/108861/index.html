  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Advertising in social networks: whether to wait for sales?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Let's return to the trend of the year - to social networks.  Runet has yet to learn how to use them as new channels of communication for the development of the brand and the formation of a loyal audience.  But social networks can be viewed as advertising platforms with traditional criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of campaigns carried out right now. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/1b0b239e/d230ee47/cbebc0e6/b9d7cc8f.jpg"><br><br>  So, our goal is to test the possibilities of social networks in the field of direct advertising aimed at sales.  Product - <a href="http://www.voicecards.ru/">Voicecards.ru voice cards</a> (congratulations on birthday, holidays, declarations of love and pranks that can be sent to your mobile).  That is the theme of entertainment, which should be well suited for social networks.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Of all social networks, our own advertising systems have only Vkontakte and Facebook, so we will tell about our experience in advertising campaigns there. <br><br>  <b>1. Vkontakte advertising site</b> <br><table><tbody><tr><th></th><th>  Date </th><th>  Transitions to the group </th><th>  Transitions to the site </th><th>  SIW </th><th>  Conversion to sales </th></tr><tr><td>  Vkontakte, link to the group </td><td>  2 weeks </td><td>  4058 </td><td>  2016 </td><td>  1.56 rub. </td><td>  0.8% </td></tr><tr><td>  Vkontakte, external link </td><td>  Week 1 </td><td>  - </td><td>  1500 </td><td>  0.91 rub. </td><td>  0.5% </td></tr></tbody></table><br>  Website promotion through advertising group tried for a long time.  And then, I remember, we waited a lot - when will it be possible to place ads with an external link, because half of the traffic was lost on the transitions from the group to the site.  A year has passed, ads with an external link have been given a green light, but the quality of traffic is falling.  What to dream now?  Probably nothing more. <br><br>  Apparently, due to the high competition, we are unable to get traffic volumes that are interesting to us.  Despite the low minimum CPC for the entire system, the price is always recommended several times higher.  There is no point in making a bet lower than recommended - there will be no hits at all.  In addition, the recommended price tends to increase as the campaign progresses. <br><br>  It is clear that the most interesting thing in social networks is targeting settings.  But the rule ‚Äúmake each ad as specialized as possible and get cheap quality traffic‚Äù does not work here.  The more targeting settings you apply, the more expensive the click becomes.  It is mysterious ... It would seem that ads written specifically for accountants from Voronezh are more likely to be noticed by this particular audience, and the competition should become less if at least someone other than me is targeting.  Who knows why the price is higher? <br><br>  <b>2. Vkontakte, advertising applications</b> <br><br>  Since we also have our own <a href="http://vkontakte.ru/app1799578">VoiceCards application for Vkontakte</a> , we also advertised it.  Of all the ways of promotion, she showed the lowest results, all because of the same too high CPC. <br><br>  Indicators on the volume of traffic are the same as in the site RK. <br>  SIW - 1.47 rubles. <br>  Conversion to application settings - 25% <br>  Conversion to sales - 5% <br><br>  <b>3. Facebook group advertising</b> <br><br><table><tbody><tr><th></th><th>  Date </th><th>  Transitions to the group </th><th>  SIW </th><th>  Conversion to fans </th><th>  Conversion to sales </th></tr><tr><td>  Facebook link to group </td><td>  2 weeks </td><td>  500 </td><td>  5.36 rub. </td><td>  34% </td><td>  5% of the total number of fans </td></tr></tbody></table><br><br>  The PCC in this social network is much higher than the specified minimum (0.6 kopecks), but the audience responded better than we expected (the planned conversion to fans was 25%).  We don‚Äôt count the number of clicks to our website this time, we only monitor purchases.  And, I must say, they are committed not only during the advertising campaign.  To place our voice content in a group, we use the Audio Player application - it is the transitions made by the ‚ÄúBuy Now‚Äù link from the player that most often end up selling. <br><br>  After receiving such a CPC on advertising, the group did not start a campaign with an external link, since  Visitors worth more than 5 rubles have no chance of making us a profit.  Maybe we will organize something before the New Year, when the conversion will be higher.  Although the competition in December may also be stronger. <br><br>  What is the result?  It can be seen that there is traffic in social networks (the statistics are not lying, most of the Runet is there :)) and users are even ready to buy the product they offer.  But the existing rules for advertising allow effective campaigns to be conducted only for clear and fairly expensive products (I think that travel agencies, English schools and clothing stores are not there for nothing).  For everyone else, advertising on the same social networks through contextual advertising systems is much more profitable - from October you can be placed in Vkontakte applications via Runner, and you can get to Odnoklassniki a long time ago through Google Adwords. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/108861/">https://habr.com/ru/post/108861/</a></p>
