  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Rapidshare suing all pirates</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  One of the most popular (if not the most popular) file-sharing services in the world Rapidshare became a defendant in a German court on a claim for copyright infringement.  The Rapidshare service provides its customers with a paid and free-of-charge file hosting and file sharing services.  Users can go to the page of the service that provides hosting, download any file and get a link to it.  The link is distributed to colleagues and friends, laid out on websites, blogs and forums.  After going through it, everyone can download this file to your computer. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  There are a great number of such services both in the world and in Russia, and most of them, in order to avoid problems with the law, prefer to position themselves as assistants for office workers - something like ‚Äúthe presentation is too big to attach it to an email?  Take advantage of our service! ".  But it is not a secret to anyone that in fact they are overwhelmingly used to share music, video and pornography.  For those who are too lazy to understand the intricacies of setting up p2p clients, this is an excellent choice - each such service has a limit on the maximum amount of uploaded files, usually allowing you to share, for example, full music albums, rather than individual tracks, or movies of different content without dividing them into many small pieces. <br><br>  So, when last year Germany was overtaken by a wave of ‚Äúcopyright‚Äù struggle, and in the country, under the pressure of representatives of the film and recording industry, a law was enacted that, from January 1, 2007, imprisonment for downloading music and movies from the Network (2 years and 5 years - for downloading for commercial purposes), Rapidshare, sensing something was wrong, took action.  Rapidshare.com was opened to help (and replace) Rapidshare.de, located in Germany, in Switzerland, which most users gradually switched to.  But the German RIAA - GEMA - it did not bother, and at the end of last year, she began to pursue both Rapidshare offices, counting on help and understanding from the Swiss police. <br><br>  The essence of the charges is simple and familiar in numerous lawsuits against Napster - they say, Rapidshare, by providing its file hosting services, contributes to the growth of piracy.  Thus, the departure to the COM zone and to Switzerland was not saved by the famous file file store, currently in Germany, literally in disgrace, from the court.  GEMA, which manages the copyright of 60 thousand of its participants, is serious.  At the end of March, the court ruled that the hoster could be responsible for copyright infringement by its users, and ordered Rapidshare to refine the filters to avoid further copyright infringement.

      GEMA CEO commented on the court‚Äôs decision: ‚ÄúIt confirms that this is not the task of the copyright holders - to monitor the operations on file exchange services, which profit from copyright infringements by their clients, with their own money.  This solution will serve as a good signal for other file sharing services that help individual users to create a huge system for the exchange of illegal products. " <br><br>  However, on the same day, Rapidshare, having taken a heroic stance, officially stated that it would appeal.  this judicial decision can inflict an irreparable blow to other companies engaged in providing free disk space to their customers.  Rapidshare is going to focus on the fact that today it is not possible to technically check every file uploaded by thousands of users for the presence of certain ‚Äúprohibited‚Äù materials in it.  In the end, reminds the German service, there is nothing illegal in sharing with your friends a copy of an honestly purchased music album with friends - and how to distinguish such a download from a truly ‚Äúpirated‚Äù one? <br><br>  Source: <a href="http://telnews.ru/event/11655/">telnews.ru/event/11655</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/6557/">https://habr.com/ru/post/6557/</a></p>
