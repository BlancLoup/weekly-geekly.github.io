  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Freshtel in Ukraine - live broadcast of emotions from the presentation</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Thanks to the announcement on Habr√©, I decided to look at the presentation of the 4G Internet from Freshtel. <br><br>  I will say right away - the impressions are varied.  Since I work in the field of organizing events (or simply events), it was somewhat strange to watch.  But this is a separate issue.  Now about the Internet itself. <br><br>  The presentation is a stage with two pavilions - one for a press conference, the other - an ‚Äúinternet cafe‚Äù.  In total, according to an employee of the Internet cafe, it‚Äôs a test zone, about 40 computers are connected.  Plus broadcasting on the Internet.  Netbooks - Acrer Aspire One and Lenovo S10 are installed in the test zone.

      By running almost at the same time speedtest.net on two computers, we got on one: 9.5 Mbits down, 1 up;  on the second: 3.5 down, 0.3 up. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  On the one hand, taking into account the number of simultaneous connections on an area of ‚Äã‚Äã100 sq. M.  it can be concluded that this is very good.  On the other hand, is not such a number of subscribers for one cell at least the network load norm, let alone overloading?  By the way, the operator advertises 20mbit. <br><br>  The highlight of the presentation was the performance of the group.  Musicians play on stage, and the vocalist sang in live mode from the operator's office.  Visually, neither the video nor the sound lagged.  Having experience with live performances, I was somewhat strange to see this.  I think that the sound from the musicians should go from the stage to the office, it should be heard by the vocalist, get into the rhythm, and then the sound + video should flow to the stage.  It is difficult to say whether it was easy or difficult to achieve such a result.  The ping from the netbook from which I am writing, to yahoo.com, averages about 260ms.  All IMHO, naturally.  Judge for yourself. <br><br>  In general, I will say that I am glad that this sphere has begun to appear in our country too.  Although at the moment, IMHO, the operator is useless: covering only the center of Kiev, slowing youtube) (do not take it too straightforward, rather as a general measure of the work of broadband services) <br>  On the other hand - the format of tariff plans for connecting via ADSL - payment for the speed of the ‚Äúport‚Äù, unlimited packages - this sets up a positive. <br><br>  I hope that the operator will develop, competitors will appear and service will improve. <br><br>  ZY  Wow, Lenovo's netbook seems to be - it's not mine, I apologize for the typos. <br>  ZY  It is a pity it was not possible to check the video communication in Skype. <br><br>  <b>UPD:</b> <br><br>  After talking with a representative of the operator, it was possible to find out that 43 base stations are currently operating.  More interesting is that Kiev is promised to be covered before November, maybe a little later, the flood will take on the satellite cities of Kiev, and after that - million-plus cities. <br><br>  Until the end of November, the Internet will be free, and from the first of November you will have to choose one of three tariff plans (all without traffic limit). <br><br>  As it turned out, Freshtel belongs to the operator of fixed Wimax, operating under the Alternet brand. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/69156/">https://habr.com/ru/post/69156/</a></p>
