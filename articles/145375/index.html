Of course, this is making calls and exchanging SMS messages.  And recently it is difficult to imagine not that smartphones, but also regular phones that are not equipped with clients for access to e-mail and social networks. <br><br>  A modern smartphone will allow both to view the working paper, and to distract from work for an interesting game.  But there is no limit to perfection, and sometimes the functionality of a personal communication device can manifest itself in a very unexpected incarnation.  And in order for your smartphone, for example, to work as a high-precision measuring device, you just need to install the application from the Google Play store. <br><br>  It should be noted that the considered programs are not classified as jokes.  Of course, the developers do not guarantee the absolute accuracy of measurements, and it is strange to expect this from applications using built-in sensors of a smartphone that are not highly sensitive.  The most important thing is that with their help you can get very plausible readings, and this alone is an excellent reason to look at them more closely.

    <a name="habracut"></a><h2>  3D Compass and Magnetometer </h2><br><br>  The main element of the program is a constantly rotating compass, the three-dimensional arrow of which points in the direction close to the north.  Switching modes is done using the bright buttons at the bottom of the screen. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/095/ee7/482/095ee7482a74cd12b9d3ded8f7e34951.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/00d/1e8/c67/00d1e8c6724e0116c77b2e69a4326140.png"><br><br>  In this case, the readings of the digital sensor also change, and they can display both the magnetic field strength or the distance from the azimuth in degrees, as well as certain values ‚Äã‚Äãrelated to acceleration.  There are strong doubts that having turned the phone in your hands, you will be able to achieve a significant change in the readings, but what the program can be relied on is the compass built into it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/8a2/877/5a8/8a28775a88cb752c2275fc816d2d3616.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/298/ff1/1d9/298ff11d90bdb34f94c375841415e9df.png"><br><br>  When the corresponding mode is activated, the usual scheme of the cardinal points of light is superimposed on the arrow floating in three-dimensional space.  The application takes a little time to stabilize the readings, but in the future the direction is indicated without noticeable errors. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/510/f89/77d/510f8977de8da5a3ce8b80d78f06989e.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/933/2a9/3eb/9332a93ebe271aa7f73c7c48e41b3352.png"><br><br>  We were not pleased with the richness of the settings, we can only activate the forced ban to turn off the screen.  Let the program does not shine with the intuitiveness of the interface, it can be applied in practice.  And sometimes it's just interesting to watch the throwings of an arrow obeying the readings of numerous sensors embedded in every modern smartphone. <br><br>  Free to install 3D Compass and Magnetometer: <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.plaincode.magnetmeter">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.plaincode.magnetmeter</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/705/4ae/ebc/7054aeebc6cbd9fb44a524d9af8528c5.gif"><br><br><h2>  Instant heart rate </h2><br><br>  The program for measuring the pulse.  Yes, no more, no less.  When you first start we are welcomed by a short illustrated instruction, clearly explaining what actions should be taken. <br><br>  In order for the heart rate to be successfully read, you need to hold your finger over the camera of your smartphone for 10 seconds.  In fact, the process takes a little longer, because it takes the program a few more seconds to detect the pressed finger and start counting. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/629/34b/cf2/62934bcf271bd201b9a3962f781445b6.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6c3/47d/766/6c347d766d36a7df4de98561966e5869.png"><br><br>  In general, more than a quarter of a minute to get the result does not go away, and this is quite comparable with traditional methods of counting the pulse.  Of course, it is necessary to take into account that a smartphone with an installed application needs to be taken out of its pocket, unlocked and launched from Azumio, and in this case the time required to get results will double at least. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6a8/2c5/22d/6a82c522d8340d616df50008f7ce295a.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/339/8ee/f9b/3398eef9bfe9ec605beff4070a25383b.png"><br><br>  But the progressive solution has its own benefits.  Let's not talk about the possibility of publishing heart rate indicators in social networks, but storing the results of all measurements can be a good help for tracking your health.  Not forgotten, and the possibility of adding notes, and seeing something intimidating in the list, you can remind yourself that a particular result was obtained after a serious exercise. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/fe1/d68/05d/fe1d6805d1abf85079906afb344e76cb.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/0d4/f42/15b/0d4f4215bbd5be6490f3f29a5037cff8.png"><br><br>  The program will decode the readings with the help of a detailed legend explaining which numbers are the norm for one or another type of activity. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e97/445/1fa/e974451fafd08c3289bd62fb125aba59.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a5d/0fd/317/a5d0fd3175a5d466a0e5e0cdba308756.png"><br><br>  To be able to monitor the pulse, you must register or log in using Twitter and Facebook accounts. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7a1/232/53a/7a123253abc57cb44a3f80f958c5074f.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/13e/8d0/33e/13e8d033efde28214d60f20d2fbe0a65.png"><br><br>  Settings are mainly responsible for the display of certain effects in exchange for system performance, and the automatic stopping of the procedure after 15 seconds is enabled by default. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d72/774/6fd/d727746fdb66d2d2c943ccbfe0f07fb4.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6ed/a75/274/6eda75274432d5aaa8a4c61e873a01ad.png"><br><br>  Despite the fact that the acquisition of data on the pulse is not the most obvious method, the figures for the Instant Heart Rate gives quite plausible.  Maybe, after some refinement and optimization, such solutions will become regular for mobile phones of medical personnel? <br><br>  Free install Instant Heart Rate: <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dsi.modula.android.instantheartrate">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=si.modula.android.instantheartrate</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/289/ba0/46d/289ba046d92e6d7e550ec22ef3d94331.gif"><br><br>  Buy the full version for $ 0.99: <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.azumio.instantheartrate.full">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.azumio.instantheartrate.full</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/75f/fe7/360/75ffe7360bcbd21a32e5b81d81274285.gif"><br><br><h2>  Nuclear Radiation Dosimeter </h2><br><br>  Here we have to upset you.  Despite the loud name, the program does not turn your phone into a radiation meter.  However, the application is of some interest. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c7c/f67/f27/c7cf67f27a2ff3e12c409bd8fc3108b1.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/641/11f/257/64111f2571ee5602692cd041f89957ee.png"><br><br>  To begin with, the data is obtained from the Internet, so the information in the application is up-to-date and true, and this is already worth it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5b6/c25/b37/5b6c25b3764d2af8c662202ef744a971.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/832/5e5/f9a/8325e5f9a586eb5d835ec51f2d5ad322.png"><br><br>  The main screen is divided into two zones: a Geiger counter and a dosimeter.  The first shows the dose of absorbed radiation based on the location of the nearest atomic object, and the second shows the average for the year and some other figures.  All values ‚Äã‚Äãare measured in thousandths, if not smaller, sievert fragments, so you shouldn‚Äôt particularly worry about the increased radiation background. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/511/ab1/3e6/511ab13e6812ac5f0b5c24ea0a87a25b.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/bde/8c5/7b6/bde8c57b697269af1022450fcb2e6815.png"><br><br>  It is much more interesting to look at the radiation hazard map generated automatically based on your location.  On the basis of the specified criteria, the program can construct detailed graphs that reflect the levels of radiation in various cities. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/412/a1c/642/412a1c64253a7bdd8ce06821fe25fa9d.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b40/326/b31/b40326b31b0d289b5b595ba47d8c3d5d.png"><br><br>  Unfortunately, the full set of filters is available only in the paid version, and the free one starts up to a frenzy for a long time - you have to wait as long as 10 seconds to get started. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/975/db6/909/975db6909eba1cbd06cfebf593b6bc20.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/fc4/b86/68e/fc4b8668ea92e1f35e8ba8620a28ab10.png"><br><br>  Nuclear Radiation Dosimeter also contains a cognitive comparative table, which brings together almost all possible events that increase the dose of absorbed radiation.  As you might guess, it all starts with a harmless visit to the radiologist's office, and ends with the disastrous consequences of a direct hit by an atomic bomb. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/bdc/953/334/bdc9533347115cbe02dd09f01407e1a2.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/afb/0f3/84a/afb0f384adbb65ca393276696328c35f.png"><br><br>  Hopefully, the study of radiation will continue to be of purely academic interest, and a functional, if not very verified in terms of design, application will help us with this. <br><br>  Free install Nuclear Radiation Dosimeter: <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.dosiapp.RadiationDosimeterFree">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dosiapp.RadiationDosimeterFree</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a39/cfa/9ac/a39cfa9ac24fade409dae9dd5d81ebaf.gif"><br><br>  Buy the full version for ~ 111 RUR: <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.dosiapp.RadiationDosimeter">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dosiapp.RadiationDosimeter</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4a9/64e/3e9/4a964e3e9ce89773f404247c11c2615d.gif"><br><br>  As you can see, the depths of the Google Play app store sometimes contain very real diamonds worthy of very close examination.  Let the programs and not always work exactly how, as I would like to think when looking at the title, they are definitely beneficial and can be useful in the most unexpected circumstances. <br><br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/145375/">https://habr.com/ru/post/145375/</a></p>
