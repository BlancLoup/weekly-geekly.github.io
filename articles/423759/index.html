      Recently <a href="https://www.plusworld.ru/daily/tehnologii/rossiyane-smogut-kontrolirovat-ispolzovanie-svoih-personalnyh-dannyh-2/">it became known</a> that in Russia they create a digital resource that will help citizens learn full information about the use of their personal data.  This portal will allow to prohibit unwanted actions with personal data. <br><br>  The resource should appear in the IV quarter of this year.  Experts say that the appearance of the service will provide a more delicate treatment of various companies with the data of its users.  However, in order for the service to be effective, the organization must be obliged to work with it in accordance with the law. <br><br>  Now the portal is at the very beginning of development.  In addition to the purely technical side, it is necessary to work out the rest - for example, determine how citizens will learn about the use of their personal information, as well as whether the portal will become public. <br><br>  Currently, personal data of citizens are processed by hundreds of government agencies and commercial companies in different volumes and different systems.  Most often, a citizen simply does not know where and how his personal information is used.  In order to create a single base, you will have to spend a lot of work. <br><br>  In general, the initiative is not bad.  How it will be implemented and how protected it will be - time will tell. <br><br><h3>  Bank of Russia showed a prototype marketplace </h3><br>  A few days ago, the Central Bank <a href="http://www.banki.ru/news/lenta/%3Fid%3D10509077">presented a</a> prototype of the marketplace, on which such organizations as the Central Bank itself, the National Settlement Depository, the financial portal Banki.ru and several Russian banks worked.  The resource was tested by Deputy Chairman of the Bank of Russia Sergey Shvetsov.  He was the first to test the prototype by placing a virtual million rubles on a deposit in one of the participating banks. <br><br><blockquote>  When a client chose one or another product, he compared it, but could not always buy through us, the information went to the bank, we did not always know if the client had used the product.  This technology will allow us to understand where the client went, to receive feedback from the bank and help the client select the product he needs.  And the second important reason for our participation is the opportunity to make a financial service accessible, </blockquote>  - said the General Director of Banki.ru Dinara Yunusova, explaining why Banki.ru participates in the Central Bank‚Äôs project to create a marketplace. <br><br>  It is worth noting that in the new project the participant will have to register all financial transactions. <br><br><blockquote>  You [banks.  - Approx.  Ed.] do not know the client, the client does not know you, you are in different parts of the country, for you the recorder of final transactions is a source of truth.  The registration made in the registration is the basis - in which case - for the proceedings with the ombudsman.  You see all the transactions in the transaction, the individual sees in the registrar all the transactions that are associated with him.  &lt;...&gt; If something doesn‚Äôt fit in, you can ask the platform for a limited time to clarify anything.  If you have not done so, the transaction becomes final, </blockquote>  - explained Shvetsov. <br><br><h3>  Strange botnet is fighting cryptomines </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9e8/a3b/1a6/9e8a3b1a6a984e02a78a00b8136fe087.jpg"><br><br>  A botnet called Fbot does nothing bad (at least for now).  Instead, it <a href="https://forklog.com/neobychnyj-botnet-unichtozhaet-skrytyh-kriptovalyutnyh-majnerov/">searches for and destroys</a> hidden mining programs. <br><br>  This botnet is a variation of the Satori worm, which, in turn, is the ideological heir to Mirai.  The principle of its operation is the search for the malicious program com.ufo.miner. <br><br>  The botnet works through the open ports, after which it deletes com.ufo.miner if it finds it.  It scans the network, spreads through it, is installed on top of malicious software (the range of types of vulnerable programs is not too wide) and self-destructs.  By the way, the botnet does not use the standard domain name system, but a decentralized analog ‚Äî EmerDNS. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/7m/b5/gu/7mb5gu5hn6if7qff0-irfphwh7i.png"><br><br><blockquote>  Choosing Fbot in favor of EmerDNS instead of traditional DNS is quite interesting.  This raised the bar for cybersecurity experts who find it difficult to track such a botnet (security systems fail because they only search by traditional DNS names) </blockquote>  - researchers note. <br><br><h3>  CloudFlare has developed a new content delivery channel. </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/8_/hc/xb/8_hcxbdn3elv-gjb9bfnavvnvf8.png"><br><br>  The American service CloudFlare has <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/distributed-web-gateway/">developed a</a> specialized decentralized channel based on the InterPlanetary File System communication protocol - IPFS. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/db/ee/7z/dbee7z379qnbodgv-o-h4sap05w.png"><br><br>  Channel users get access to content without the need to install specialized software.  Availability of content is guaranteed to the user, regardless of the status of the server on which it is stored. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/423759/">https://habr.com/ru/post/423759/</a></p>
