Mnemonics are ways to memorize information by changing the type of information.  Instead of memorizing numbers, memorize words.  Instead of words, you can memorize places.  Instead of moves in chess - a poem. <br><br>  The simplest example of mnemonics is an example of a rhyme, thanks to which you can easily remember the first digits after the decimal point in Pi: <br><blockquote>  To make us not be mistaken <br>  It is necessary to read correctly: <br>  Three, fourteen, fifteen, <br>  Ninety two and six. <br>  Well, then you need to know <br>  If we ask you - <br>  It will be five, three, five, <br>  Eight, nine, seven. </blockquote><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d25/2a6/866/d252a68664ebe3c07544c2b45c3c8087.jpg"><br>  <i>write in the comments other examples of rhymes for Pi.</i>  <i>I know that there are a lot of them.</i>

      Frankly, I specifically did not look for information on mnemonics in Habr.  I want to give a look on my part: what I know.  I had no desire to ‚Äúdilute‚Äù information with other sources.  There is a lot of useful information under the cut, which I collected for a very long time bit by bit. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Mnemonic is very extensive: it has dozens of ways to memorize everything you need.  Some of the ways I considered bad, some too complicated.  Therefore, I have identified several of the best, in my opinion, methods of mnemonics.  I will not specifically insert descriptions from other sites, explaining everything in my own words. <br><br><h4>  Palace of Memory (Cicero Road) </h4><br><h5>  Description </h5><br>  The ancient philosopher and orator Cicero went to work on a daily basis.  Possessing brilliant attention, he noticed every day various features on the way he walked.  After a long time, Cicero remembered the road so well that he could perfectly recall any of her interval with all the details. <br>  After this, Cicero learned to ‚Äútie‚Äù to the road some objects in his memory.  And when he recalled a place on the road, he instantly remembered a subject that was ‚Äútied‚Äù to the place.  This is called <b>an association</b> . <br><br>  The Palace of Memory method (hereinafter, I mean the road of Cicero) consists in strong associative links, thanks to which one can remember <b>any</b> amount of information <b>in the correct order</b> . <br><br><h5>  How to remember? </h5><br>  To use the palace of memory, you need to have a good imagination.  In fact, anyone can use this method, but a good imagination will help a lot. <br><br>  Take the abstract random set of products you need to buy at the supermarket: <br><ol><li>  Sugar pack </li><li>  Crackers </li><li>  Jar of peas </li><li>  Crab sticks </li><li>  Strawberry Jam </li><li>  Carrots </li><li>  A dozen eggs </li><li>  Piece of meat </li><li>  A bunch of bananas </li><li>  A carton of milk </li></ol><br>  <i>as you can see, my fantasy is not so good</i> <br><br>  Now we need to find the ‚Äúroad‚Äù to which we will tie this shopping list.  Imaginative people can come up with hundreds of different places and remember them well (space station, football field in an underwater camp, whatever), but for a small list of ten items, you can use the real road. <br><br>  I will give an example of my ‚Äúroad‚Äù and show you how to tie objects to it.  Here is my path that I make in the morning every day: <br><br><ol><li>  Bed (I wake up on it) </li><li>  Toilet (is it worth writing?) </li><li>  Kitchen (breakfast) </li><li>  Corridor (dressing, shoes) </li><li>  Entrance (down the stairs) </li><li>  Billboard with advertisements opposite the entrance. </li><li>  Traffic light that I pass daily. </li><li>  Shop with ice cream. </li><li>  Barrier before school. </li><li>  Porch school. </li></ol><br>  The more information you need to remember, the more it is worth making the road.  Or longer - that is easier for you.  The main thing - to perfectly remember in my head all the way.  There are no problems with my darling, I go to school every day. <br><br>  Now let's take a look at the shopping list.  The most important thing in an associative connection: to make unique, unusual, funny or horrifying, any extraordinary associations.  Simple associations "on the bed is a pack of sugar" do not fit.  Try to add feelings to your associations: sound (crunch crackers), touch (nasty sugar). <br><br><ol><li>  All night I slept not on the bed, but on a pack of sugar.  The tutu was full of holes and sugar crumbs everywhere, they crack unpleasantly, yuck! </li><li>  I go to the toilet and step on the crackers (vile sound), I slip and start to fall into the toilet.  (what you can't do for mnemonics) </li><li>  Getting out of this hell, I go into the kitchen, open the locker, and a huge mountain of peas falls out on me, slippery and nasty (I don't like peas) </li><li>  In the corridor, instead of a spoon, I use crab sticks to put on shoes.  Naturally, it breaks down and I put on shoes with a wand inside. </li><li>  I go out to the staircase, start down the stairs and slip on the jam (something has come down with falls, I-y-y-ay) </li><li>  On the shield adorns the purchase of the planet Carrot. </li><li>  At the traffic lights, when I cross the road, they shower me with eggs from cars. </li><li>  I decide to buy ice cream, and on the spot ice cream list different pieces of meat (abomination, never forget it) </li><li>  Barrier opens monkey for a bunch of bananas.  Quest! </li><li>  Only step on the porch, the whole floor turns into a dairy pool!  And I can not swim!  Wow ... </li></ol><br>  Most likely my associations will seem stupid or unsuccessful.  But this is the first thing that occurred to me.  And this is the most important.  You do not need to think long about the association, choose the first thing that comes to mind, otherwise you will remember as long as you thought out.  Try it a few times and you will do it very quickly, believe me. <br><br>  Thanks to this method, I easily memorize 50-60 objects, and potentially - they can be unlimited - how long is your road or roads (no one forbids using several!). <br><br><h5>  Snapping to numbers </h5><br>  Another way to remember any list or other information.  The method is somewhat more complicated, requires preparation, but there is no need to invent or memorize the road. <br><br>  For each number from 1 to [as many as you need], you come up with a rhyme that comes first to mind.  Instead of rhyme, you can use a strong association that you have with the number.  The main thing is to be inventive.  It goes like this: <br><br><ul><li>  One - Aladdin </li><li>  Two - Lithuania </li><li>  Three - rub (lamp) </li><li>  Four - holes in cheese </li><li>  Five - honey agaric </li><li>  Six - Six.  (similar to writing) </li><li>  Seven - James Bond (007) </li><li>  Eight - Snowman.  (8 looks like a snowman) </li><li>  Nine - Swan </li><li>  Zero - Gingerbread Man </li></ul><br>  Now, in order to memorize (bind some object) you only need to make an associative connection with this object.  The advantage of this method in the absence of the road, we can easily go through the numbers.  The disadvantage of the method is preparation. <br><br><h5>  Interesting fact </h5><br>  Japanese Hideaki Tomoyori can reproduce the number of PIs up to 40,000 characters.  It took him about 10 years to memorize such a number of digits. <br>  <a href="http://mnemotexnika.narod.ru/sport_01.htm">mnemotexnika.narod.ru/sport_01.htm</a> <br><br><h5>  PS </h5><br>  I will tell you about other ways next time.  There are many different methods to memorize numbers and words.  And now a few truths about mnemonics, which I noticed at the time of employment: <br><ul><li>  Need a minimum of practice.  After two or three attempts, you will be good at making associative links. </li><li>  In life, this is rarely needed. </li><li>  But it develops the usual memory! </li><li>  Most of your friends will not be able to memorize 20 items in the correct order, you can show off;) </li></ul><br><h5>  Where did you get it? </h5><br><ul><li>  Corinda - 13 steps to mentalism </li><li>  Dominic O'Brien - How to Develop a Perfect Memory </li><li>  Stepanov - Mnemonic.  Truth and fiction (so-so book) </li></ul><br><br>  If you find errors in the text - write to private messages, I will promptly correct it.
