It would seem that in the 2,000 years that Halloween has existed, the tradition of making scary costumes is gone, and now there are no restrictions on his choice.  The costume can be both grandiose and minimalist, but if they are supported by a living story, they will be perceived with delight.  But what if you still want to stand out against the background of various Draculas, Pumpkins and Harley Quinn?  Make costumes of the future! <br><br>  It sounds very shocking, but it opens up a large field for fantasy.  You can make costumes using modern 3D printing technology, attaching multi-colored LED strips and LED flashlights, complementing the costume with various technological features.  For geek happiness you need so little!  We have compiled several non-dull instructions for you that will help you create your dream costume. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h1>  Fiber Optic Dress </h1><br>  For fiber, you need a very strong base, so a dress with a tight corset and a wrap was chosen for it, so that the optical fiber lay ‚Äúmagnificently‚Äù on the skirt and freely rotate around it.  For ease of experiment, or if you do not know how to sew, you can take a ready-made V-shaped dress with a tutu or a fluffy circular skirt.  And if you want to sew a dress with your own hands, then step-by-step <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Fiber-Optic-Dress/">detailed instructions</a> will help you.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/018/1d4/5e0/0181d45e03cc41a496fd30cceeb57260.jpg"><br><br>  To create a futuristic dress image, you need a fiber-optic whip.  But he has his significant drawbacks in addition to the high cost.  The battery life of the whip is very short, and the process of changing the battery is very complicated.  The battery runs on 3.7 V lithium-ion batteries for about 45 minutes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/937/8ee/932/9378ee9328b34a1cae72710a6a83db4f.jpg"><br><br>  Therefore, the most difficult task was the ability to connect the whip with an additional battery pack, which would extend the term of fiber shining.  Therefore, we place the battery pack under the skirt strap and connect it to the whip located on the back of the dress.  In order for the dress to look neat, we sew a small piece of fabric with velcro, so that you can hide the base of the fiber-optic whip with the battery, but also to have quick access to it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/95a/9b3/fe5/95a9b3fe589949ba9ac8992b516cdc00.jpg"><br><br>  The fluffy form of a skirt in the form of a pack helps to create a ‚Äújellyfish effect‚Äù at the expense of fiber-optic fibers sliding along it.  In addition, the tight skirt allows beautifully ‚Äúspringing‚Äù the fiber along the dress and is easier to attach to it.  Then proceed to the most time-consuming part of the work - the creation of the contour of a dress of fiber. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dce/f18/80d/dcef1880d17a45dcbb6e28fadda39d16.jpg"><br><br>  In total, there are 360 ‚Äã‚Äãfibers of the optical fiber in the whip; we divide them into groups of 10 threads and we wind them with thread or rope.  Then we distribute them along the dress, fixing it at the waist.  After the groups of threads are fixed at the waist, the hardest work begins: the fastening of each group along the corset on the figure.  The work is very slow, but the result is worth it.  After fixing the threads you need to cut them to the desired length.  Here everyone can create a completely different form.  In this case, the principle of ‚Äúlayered‚Äù haircut was chosen, creating a fiber-optic skirt with threads of various lengths. <br><br>  Done!  This dress looks as impressive as Zack Posen's <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BE7Ebb7m9B9/">dress</a> for Claire Danes, but it is more practical and diminutive.  Just for the Halloween party. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1e4/2e1/4cb/1e42e14cb6194c39a927bda71485c8b2.jpg"><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://player.vimeo.com/video/90813551" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h1>  Shimmering Seahorse </h1><br>  Inspiration for an unusual costume can come quite unexpectedly, as happened with the author of the seahorse costume, presented at <a href="http://www.costume-works.com/ethereal_seahorse.html">costume-works.com</a> .  A trip to the aquarium with my sister opened in it a long-forgotten children's passion for incredibly bright and beautiful creatures - seahorses - and pushed for experiments.  Materials for this costume were found in household goods stores and decorated with fabric and sequins.  For this suit fit any shoes and dress, as long as they are the same color with the seahorse. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c34/9f5/c21/c349f5c213c94bffb7a44f21c434a7b4.jpg"><br><br>  In order to make a shiny seahorse, you don‚Äôt need a lot of materials, a fairly solid insulated wire with a copper core, electrical tape, glue, fabric, sparkles, buttons, LED flashlights and a battery for them.  This costume made an incredible impression on the public, because it is made by hand from materials that can be easily found in any household goods store.  With a suit they were photographed, cuddled, someone even kissed him.  But for the author, the most important success was that he shared his inspiration with other people, awakening their innermost childhood dreams in them. <br><br><h1>  Project Alan </h1><br>  The idea for another costume also originated on the basis of children's fantasies.  But only the fantasy belonged to the daughter, and her father realized it.  <a href="http://www.projectalan.com/Kids2008/Halloween/Halloween2008.htm">Incredibly cute story</a> about how a girl Sasha got the idea to dress up for Halloween in a robot costume.  Robots for a girl are a real passion, and the father-engineer could not help but support her daughter‚Äôs passion. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b2e/321/c42/b2e321c42bf74fe1a650ee97d862ab3f.jpg"><br><br>  Three months before Halloween, his father began to design the costume, a month later he began to look for parts for him in hardware stores and pawnshops.  A month before the holiday, he created a test model of the costume and put it to the test in order to finally get the final model of the costume.  In the presence of light, the costume amazes with a futuristic cartoon design, and in its absence it is decorated with multi-colored lights of LED bulbs.  The costume received many rave reviews and even a prize in the children's costume competition. <br><br><h1>  LED shoe clips </h1><br>  An interesting idea for the costume was presented by Becky Stern, decorating her dress with shoes with LED clips.  The use of these clips is multifunctional, and despite the fact that the <a href="http://makezine.com/projects/LED-Shoe-Clips/">author made</a> these clips for shoes, they are suitable for children and adults.  You can attach them not only to shoes, but also to clothes.  The author assures that it will take no more than two hours to make them, and finding the parts for making them is not so difficult. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/df5/730/f92/df5730f927e446ddb5b024c9a6dd81a3.jpg"><br><br>  To do this, you will need a sewing kit LED (conductive thread, 4 LEDs, 2 CR2032 batteries), as well as some standard sewing accessories and a pair of clips.  In addition, you need to choose the fabric to match the color of the suit.  For each clip you need to cut 8 circles from the fabric.  In order for the tissue circles not to creep away, the edges of the circles need to be set on fire a little.  In the center of each circle you need to fix the LED, and then fold the circle into a wedge, folding it in half twice.  Then all 8 ‚Äúwedges‚Äù need to be stitched together and connected to the batteries. <br><br>  Step-by-step instructions can be viewed in the video, in which Becky describes in detail how to make clips. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DsaZ8_uMt-Y" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h1>  LED tights </h1><br>  Following a similar principle, you can make <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Light-Up-Leggings/">tights with LEDs</a> .  To do this, you will need these consumables: leggings, conductive threads, 2 connectors for a button battery, 2 button batteries 3 V, 2 220 Ohm resistors, 12 LEDs, a metal fastener, a needle and cardboard on which to sew comfortably. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b2b/e57/2b2/b2be572b2e2a4d7db5c563282d7de354.jpg"><br><br>  Draw an electrical circuit first on paper.  Each leg is a separate circuit with six LEDs.  LEDs are connected in parallel.  The rest of the scheme is in the back of the leggings.  Use tweezers to bend the ends of the resistors and LEDs.  In order to make it easy to sew LEDs to leggings, stick a cardboard inside them and sew all the details according to the scheme. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a89/02b/07e/a8902b07ecab46cc98d36faca12fcfe2.jpg"><br><br><h1>  iron Man </h1><br>  The costume should not always be large and as detailed as possible.  Especially, if not enough time to make it so.  So the <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Make-an-Iron-Man-Arc-Reactor/">author</a> did, having made only one detail from the Iron Man's suit - the reactor.  The main goal of this costume was to create the lightest, most realistic reactor that could be mounted on a naked body so that it could appear through the outer clothing. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7f4/8b4/377/7f48b4377b74463f8f984270b3dc3922.jpg"><br><br>  If there is a desire to make such a reactor at home, <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Make-an-Iron-Man-Arc-Reactor/">then</a> you can study step-by-step instructions, including a detailed list of the materials used, schemes and sequence of actions. <br><br>  But you can create an element of the costume not only using various methods at hand.  You can use a 3D printer to print out any elements of the costume.  The author <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/3D-Printing-an-Ironman-Helmet/">considers</a> how to make the Iron Man helmet using a 3D printer.  Naturally, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating replicas of Iron Man's costumes, he had after watching the Avengers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6bb/295/322/6bb295322765474d922d1d26cd4f851d.jpg"><br><br>  Step-by-step instructions can be found here, and if in brief, the author took the Pepakura model, then exported it to a format for another program for 3D animation and modeling - Maya.  Then he divided the model into connecting pieces, because the Spectrum z510 small-sized 3D printer could not print the entire helmet.  If everything is done according to the instructions, then the last step is to connect the parts of the helmet with each other and insert the LEDs into the ‚Äúeye‚Äù area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe helmet. <br><br><h1>  Explosive suit GALAXY NOTE 7 </h1><br>  In the wake of the sensational <a href="https://hi-tech.mail.ru/news/samsung-galaxy-note-7-export-manufacturing-stopped/">scandals with explosions of</a> Samsung Galaxy Note 7, Imgur user and trendsetter on Halloween excit3d created a very shocking smoking suit from Galaxy Note 7 boxes. Although this phone was quite dangerous, parts of it could be used as parts for a suit.  Outside, the suit looks pretty simple - the boxes from the smartphone are glued to the T-shirt. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/338/556/d63/338556d635804bbab9b21e819817f060.jpg"><br><br>  For the manufacture of a suit, you will need boxes from a smartphone, plastic pipes, T-connectors (tees) and a large amount of hot glue.  After all the items have been assembled, you will need to blow into the mouthpiece and watch the boxes emit thick smoke.  Despite the fact that the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 was withdrawn from production, and we will never see them again, they have left their ominous mark in the history of smartphones. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wqKTTs_qFZk" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  To create a great Halloween costume, in most cases, you need fantasy and available tools.  But when this is not enough, you can add to your costume ‚Äúzest‚Äù in the form of LED strips, LED light bulbs or items printed on a 3D printer.  The costumes of the future will help to plunge into the futuristic atmosphere, diluting the atmosphere of cartoony and bloodiness.  The pleasure of a homemade costume can not be compared with that which can be obtained simply by purchasing a costume.  Especially if you can make it unique.  Happy Halloween! <br><br>  PS Well, if you don‚Äôt bother with preparing this costume, fashionable technologies will help you - today we have an <a href="https://corp.mail.ru/ru/press/releases/9784/">update</a> with three-dimensional masks in ICQ that can be applied to photos or videos. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/398715/">https://habr.com/ru/post/398715/</a></p>
