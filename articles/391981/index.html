So you need to carefully follow the feedback on the seller and his rating.  Tolley case GearBest site, for three years, this site has proven itself well, and all controversial issues there are easily solved through the support service without intermediaries.  Prada, prices are not always more profitable there than on Ali, but you have to pay extra for quality service.  So today, GearBest has just a birthday and most of the products can be bought at a discount.  Almost all products are now going to the action, and some have a ‚ÄúFlash‚Äù action.  This is when the price falls for a certain period of time, just have time to buy.  I offer you just a selection of such products with discounts that will interest almost every geek. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c8c/baf/930/c8cbaf930714456183bb3bb626ec401e.jpg"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

    <h3>  1. Universal drill bit </h3><br>  Let's start with the simple.  Perhaps many have already heard about this miracle "bat" for a drill or a key-ratchet. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b4c/98c/59b/b4c98c59bb3945009e9c0e41deccb24d.JPG"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4ad/a5f/499/4ada5f499bf5435f816bc548d69d1843.JPG"><br><br>  Allows you to easily unscrew any nonstandard bolts and screws to which with a regular key by no means approach.  And in general can replace keys from 7 to 19 mm, combining all these sizes.  You can carry with you in the glove compartment with a bicycle or in a backpack with a longboard, well, just in case. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e9f/e34/196/e9fe341963be410fa3d11d1a9e377c39.gif"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4b1/2df/b39/4b12dfb39bd04f788e7bba8a8f4f0ff2.gif"><br><br>  From the picture, the principle of operation is already clear, there are many spring-loaded steel pins inside, which can slide inward to form a grip of the right size for the nut. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c07/bb9/3d9/c07bb93d9b2b47adbd65c1bb61924a5d.gif"><br><br>  The price at the time of the "wave of discounts" (let's call it that) will be <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/nn">$ 5.99 *</a> you only need to catch it. <br><br><h3>  2. Arduino nano v3 </h3><br>  But ‚Äúmoving brains‚Äù is not ‚Äúturning the nuts‚Äù, and here Arduino often comes into play.  Yes, this is not the most hardcore, but the price is not great, and even with arduina it is easier though.  Already studied it far and wide, and projects on it can be done very much. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1f5/06a/c45/1f506ac45dcf4c6781a504f7dad40993.jpg"><br><br>  In general, who wanted to buy an Arduino nano for another smart thing, whether it be a weather station or an element of a smart home, but could not choose where it is more profitable, then here's a good option. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/256/fa3/a2e/256fa3a2e57242869d0e8669fca175aa.jpg"><br><br>  Discount <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/no">price $ 2.89 *</a> <br>  The discount is constant for the entire period of the action, and more specifically - for three days. <br><br><h3>  3. ESP8266 type 12 </h3><br>  Arduin is good, but recently the ESP8266 wireless modules are becoming more and more popular.  This is almost a full-fledged router with GPIO outputs, and even the possibility of its programming.  With tools like Blynk, it is easy for them to ‚Äústeer‚Äù through the Internet from their smartphone anywhere in the world where there is a connection. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6e5/f2b/5f5/6e5f2b5f57ad46759f00824aa26cfb34.JPG"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/766/2ab/ace/7662abace1ff495aa2cecf7ab9fa523c.jpg"><br><br>  Add to cart if you have not tried this wonderful module yet. <br>  The cost is only <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/np">$ 3.17 *</a> and only for three days <br><br><h3>  4. <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/nq">Four-core Orange Pi H3 * microcomputer</a> </h3><br><br>  OK.  Suppose that arduin and ESP cannot provide all the power of a future project or not, suppose that they are only part of the overall system and the central part is on the computer.  But it‚Äôs expensive to keep a large system one all the time for such things, and there are issues with switching all the peripherals.  Roofing microcomputers or as they are also called "single board" like the Orange Pi or its progenitor Raspberry Pi.  Here both the processor is powerful and support for heaps of peripherals and GPIO are divorced at the same time. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/66a/c26/519/66ac265197f44ff0bd0f5ff416cfe77a.jpg"><br><br>  In general, the "orange" - one of the best substitutes for the "raspberry", so even with a more powerful stuffing for less money. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bf9/2c7/1d1/bf92c71d18fd44caa41069fa27650118.jpg"><br><br>  Price at the time of the "wave of discounts" only <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/nq">$ 18.76</a> <br><br><h3>  5. Raspberry Pi 2 Model B </h3><br>  Oh, I do not need these substitutes, someone will say.  I want only the original. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a3c/956/60a/a3c95660a22c484282e3efde28f4bc29.JPG"><br><br>  But please, he is also there.  All good, but only the price is higher.  If the price tag is not scary, then please.  Still, there is a discount, though not the same as on an orange. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9a0/699/876/9a0699876e4a454084ad923de8fc2395.JPG"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ac8/0fd/47a/ac80fd47a30b40a680fa493ec92529e9.JPG"><br><br>  The price is fixed at the time of the promotion - <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/nr">$ 32.59 *</a> but the amount is limited, may end at the wrong time. <br><br><h3>  6. Oscilloscope Assembly Kit </h3><br>  But a tool that never hurts.  True, this is a set for assembly, but the price is very attractive.  The oscilloscope is the true friend and helper for any radio engineering. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/882/e19/634/882e19634ca64715a8f14f9ba00a38b7.jpg"><br><br>  Although I didn‚Äôt collect one myself, but I‚Äôve been looking at it for a long time and I‚Äôll probably take it for myself, oh, where is the dollar for 30 dollars? <br><br>  Price on the "wave of discounts" only <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/ns">$ 16.88 *</a> <br><br><h3>  7. Endoscope for smartphone </h3><br>  A small lyrical digression from iron again instruments.  Endoscope  Very cool topic, especially when it can be connected directly to the smartphone.  Flexible cord that crawls through almost anywhere (just do not send!) With backlight and a separate button that allows you to take pictures. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b8f/a33/726/b8fa337263364781be7ad47b16770a78.jpg"><br><br>  In addition, it is waterproof, has additional attachments in the form of a hook and a magnet, and there is also a nozzle with a mirror to see what is happening on the side of the camera. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/300/db3/f7d/300db3f7dc5a4f6e85189a975e8d52f6.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a0b/5e5/4cd/a0b5e54cd18744a39f204dd3464f5a67.jpg"><br><br>  Price <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/nt">$ 8.56 *</a> , just wait for this decline on the wave. <br><br>  And now heavy artillery.  A real gadget that almost every geek wants to have - a 3D printer. <br><br><h3>  8. 3D printer </h3><br>  There is everything you need for a normal print almost out of the box.  The screen with a card reader for offline printing without a computer, a good power supply with passive cooling, means one less noise source.  Direct extruder, which allows you to print with flexible materials or change color directly during printing.  In general, a dream and not a machine.  And I‚Äôll tell you in secret that GearBest has a warehouse in Moscow, which means there will be no problems with customs during delivery, just choose the correct warehouse when ordering. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cc8/12a/15f/cc812a15fb1e443694a02ecd820a0b7e.jpg"><br><br>  I definitely recommend the purchase; a similar printer from parts itself will be priced at the same price, and even more expensive, but it will take a long time to configure. <br><br>  It is already a good price - only $ 207.38, but you can wait for the coveted hour and buy it at <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/nu">$ 169.78 *</a> <br><br><h3>  9. Dremel with a set of nozzles </h3><br><br>  Well, to the printer the best tool is a knife.  Although everyone has a knife, but it is more convenient to handle plastic with Dremels, good and you can take it at a discount. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7aa/ddf/374/7aaddf374c7145c486f27937a30f3ba0.jpg"><br><br>  It is already in a convenient storage box and with a set of essential accessories.  And if you add to it a flexible shaft, then you can hang on the printer, getting a small CNC machine.  The truth on such a board with aluminum is not drunk, but you can cut the boards or acrylic at the same time, the main "zero" is to expose the table carefully, and then the table can be holed. <br><br>  Discount <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/nv">price $ 26.26 *</a> <br><br><h3>  10. Kit for assembling crawler bot with claw and FPV camera </h3><br>  Eh, who in childhood did not dream of having his own robot?  As time goes by, the years go by, and robots still have not yet appeared. <br>  The following set will help you fulfill your old childhood dream. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/28d/567/250/28d56725028a46a98a8dd06ad5243996.jpg"><br><br>  He is of course the most expensive of the above gadgets.  Even its printer is cheaper, but it's a dream!  metal chassis, real tracks, swivel FPV camera and claw.  Already drooling. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ac6/da4/e71/ac6da4e71c3a4ddfbdda4ddda3cd37fc.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f1e/31a/985/f1e31a98513f43c1a681a26013f3cc68.jpg"><br><br>  The price without discount is $ 247 with a tail (madness!), But with a discount it is already better - only <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/nw">$ 175.59 *</a> , I enter the fight against amphibians. <br><br>  That's all, with you there was a simple service for choosing sophisticated <a href="https://dronk.ru/">Dronk.Ru</a> equipment.  Do not forget to subscribe to our <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/dronk/blog/">blog</a> , there will be many more interesting things. <br><br>  pps * - you can return up to 5% of the purchase price by purchasing goods from these links. <br>  Read more: dronk.ru/cashback <br><br> <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/vp"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a1a/bb8/6ef/a1abb86ef1faa35e01779c9805ddbbfc.gif" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  Our other publications <br><ul><li>  <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/dronk/blog/272440/">Chuwi history - from MP3 players in 2004 to tablets on Windows 10 in 2016</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/dronk/blog/272306/">A secure phone for all occasions - a small selection of the most interesting examples</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/dronk/blog/272086/">Making the house smart with Xiaomi</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/dronk/blog/271054//">Review of the budget 8 "Chuwi Vi8 Plus tablet on Windows 10 for $ 88</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/dronk/blog/270698/">Overview of the powerful tablet Chuwi Hi10 on a full Win10 for $ 180</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/dronk/blog/270618/">Seven current copters up to $ 20, which can be put in your pocket</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/dronk/blog/269526/">Xiaomi company.</a>  <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/dronk/blog/269526/">Cheaper without damage to quality is no longer</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/dronk/blog/266778/">NEJE engraver laser overview or promising business model</a> </li></ul><br>  PPS And now we are having a draw of the <a href="http://vk.com/dronk_xiaomi%3Fw%3Dwall-115553418_109%252Fall">next generation of smart bracelet - Xiaomi Mi Band 1s</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/391981/">https://habr.com/ru/post/391981/</a></p>
