  <section class="page js-page"><h1>1C server 8.2 + MsSql 2008 + BackUp</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  There are a lot of similar articles, but I first of all wrote this for myself, dwelling on notes, which describe possible problems.  I hope the article will be useful to others. <br>  1. Install the 1C platform <br>  2. Install MS SQL server 2008. When installing, set the database user.  (Which is sa). <br><br>  After installation, open the administration panel of the 1C servers of the enterprise and see that it is empty. <br>  We need to create a server: Open console root-&gt; Central 1C: Enterprise 8.2 servers.  We click on it with the right mouse button and select the new item.  In the drop-down menu, select the Central server 1C Enterprise 8.2. <a name="habracut"></a>  A window with 4 fields will open before us: <br>  <b>Protocol</b> - the protocol by which data will be transmitted <br>  <b>Name</b> - the name of the computer on the network where the server is located <br>  <b>IP port</b> port on which the server is available <br>  <b>Description</b> - <b>description</b> .  not necessary. <br><br>  Note: <br>  If the 1C platform was installed on a computer, and then the computer was renamed, then you will not be able to reach it, because the 1C platform is very smart and writes to certain files when you install the computer name, but then, when the computer name changes, their platform does not change rewrite.  These files are needed for the operation of the RAGENT 1C service (it can be found in the running services through the windows server administration panel).  All of this suggests that in order to rename these files, you must stop the RAGENT service.  The files themselves are in the following locations: <br>  C: \ Program Files (x86) \ 1cv82 \ srvinfo \ srvribrg <br>  C: \ Program Files (x86) \ 1cv82 \ srvinfo \ reg_1541 \ 1CV8Reg <br>  We open these files with a notebook and we rule the past the name of the car with the present handles.  Save and run RAGENT.

        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      Go back to the setting: <br>  After the window with fields is filled, we press the OK button and if everything is done correctly, then we will have a server by the name of the machine on which it is located. <br><br>  So.  The server is running and now we need to create a database on the MYSQL server and associate it with North 1C.  There are several ways, here I will describe the easiest: <br>  On the enterprise 1C server, open our newly created server by clicking on the + next to the server name and click on the ‚ÄúINFORMATION DATABASES‚Äù item with the right mouse button, select New-&gt; Information Base <br>  Before us opens a window in which there will be the following fields: <br><br>  <b>The name is the name of</b> our database on the server 1C (As a rule, many people write it the same as in the database field, so as not to be confused) <br>  <b>Description</b> - <b>description</b> <br>  <b>Secure connection is</b> disabled by default.  you can turn on but then the server load will increase <br>  <b>Database</b> server - if the server is on the same server, then we specify (local) exactly in parentheses, if not on this server, then we specify the server ip <br>  <b>DBMS Type</b> -Select MS SQL Type <br>  <b>Database - database</b> name on MS SQL server.  If there is no base then you can tick one of the checkboxes and it will be created <br>  <b>Database server user</b> -We specify either the user of which is created during installation, or we create a separate user in MS SQL, assign rights to it and register it here. <br>  <b>Database server user password -</b> password <br>  <b>Allow the issuance of licenses by the server 1C Enterprise</b> -We select yes <br>  <b>Country</b> -Select a country <br>  <b>Dates offset -</b> set to 0 <br>  Checkbox <b>"Create a database in the case of lack of"</b> is the same checkbox to create a database if it is not <br>  Checkbox <b>"Set blocking routine tasks"</b> -not tick <br><br>  We click OK and see that the servers are configured and we have an information base under the name we gave her in the tab ‚ÄúInformation databases‚Äù. <br><br>  Then it remains to configure BackUp.  What I‚Äôm not going to talk about is information and so is the sea.  You can for example look <a href="http//habrahabr.ru/post/131300/">in this wonderful article</a> . <br><br>  To build Backup we need to open <b>Microsoft SQL MANAGEMENT STUDIO.</b> <br>  Enter the login and connect to the server. <br>  Before us is the administrative console.  In <b>Object explorer,</b> open the <b>Management</b> tab and see <b>Maintance plans</b> in it <b>.</b>  Here we will create the necessary BackUP.  As usual, right click on the <b>Maintance plans-&gt; new maintance plan</b> .  The subplan tab will appear in the main window, and another <b>ToolBox</b> window will appear under the <b>Object Explorer</b> in which the <b>Maintance Plans Tasks is</b> embedded.  In it we will select <b>Back Up DataBase Task by</b> clicking on it 2 times.  It will be transferred to the main window.  On it we click 2 times and in front of us a window appears again with fields where we can choose which Back Up to do, which BackUp database to use, and where to save it.  At the end of the settings you need to click Ok. <br><br>  Note: <br>  Keeping Back Up in any network folder (by the way, you will have to register with pens, because the directory selection window sees only local resources), monitor access rights, and at the same time, track what kind of authentication you have on MySql server, because if authentication is not based on user accounts Windows, and the internal DBMS user, and if at the same time the AD server is raised, then BackUp will give an error when trying to execute, because it will do it on behalf of the internal DBMS user and AD will not let it go anywhere except locale  computer information. <br><br>  After you have configured the path, the base and the type of BackUp you need to configure the schedule.  To do this, in the main window above the Task you created there is a <b>SubPlan</b> sign.  At the end of the plate (on the right) there is a calendar icon.  Clicking on it will take you to the schedule setting.  By marking the checkboxes of the days and setting the time you set up the schedule.  Clicking 2 times on the field called <b>SubPlan</b> you can change the name of Task-a.  After setting all go to File-&gt; <b>Save All</b> .  After saving to Maintance plans, Task will appear with your name that you gave to BackUp. <br><br>  At the end of the setting, it is imperative to check the Work.  To do this, right-click on the created Task and execute Exicute. <br><br>  Note: <br>  If Exicute is executed with an error, read the errors that Studio will give you, and first check if you are running the <b>SQL server agent</b> .  That he is engaged in the implementation of tasks and the Exicute function refers to him for the implementation of tasks.  If it is not running, the attempt to perform will fail.  To see if the agent is working or not in Studio in the Object Explorer, go to the <b>SQL Server Agent</b> tab.  If the red circle with a cross is on the icon, the agent is stopped.  You can start it by right-clicking on it and selecting the START option in the context menu. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/149241/">https://habr.com/ru/post/149241/</a></p>
