      The invitation was sent to several authoritative communities in the network, including Habr. <br><br>  Testing took place successfully.  About the testing, its prerequisites and its results - in this message. <br><br>  The reason for holding such an event is obvious - the low level of trust in acoustic systems such as the soundbar, which was also manifested in the discussion of the piece of iron on a Habr√©, is due to logical prerequisites: <br><br>  1) The concept of "column in front, and the sound from behind" is a priori doubtful, since it contradicts everyday experience and the natural course of things. <br><br>  2) The thin plastic case of the system causes natural doubts about the sound quality <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h5>  Prerequisites </h5><br><br>  <i>‚ÄúComrades, gevolyutsiya will zavtga!</i>  <i>And now - a disco! "From the Apocrypha of the CPSU (b)</i> <br><br>  The solution to these two problems ‚Äî a decent sound from thin speakers and the illusion of rear sound ‚Äî was found about five years ago. <br><br>  Nevertheless, for many reasons, not the least of which is the fact that the sound bars now rivet anyone who is not lazy, having neither decent technologies, nor a well-functioning production, the revolution in acoustics turned out to be very quiet. <br><br>  By and large, the revolution (and this is exactly the revolution ‚Äî after all, further progress in this area can change our very understanding of the concept of home acoustic systems) went unnoticed. <br><br>  The situation is anecdotal, in the spirit of the famous strip xkcd: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/comment_images/339/4e8/a02/3394e8a029d0759914e70137a2ce9de1.png" title="Something out there helps to reach potential customers."><br><br>  Even if there are really sound bars somewhere - they drown in a pile of sticks that sound like a toilet bowl from a public toilet. <br><br>  Accordingly, the decision was self-evident - to show the goods as a face on the example of Polk Audio SurroundBAR 6000 IHT.  Moreover, the manufacturer, though not very well known in our Palestinians, <br>  even earned a mention in the English Wiki by the word soundbar - as a pioneer and founder. <br><br><h5>  And what came of it </h5><br><br>  <i>"What is it, Barrymore?"</i> <br><br>  We will not talk about the progress of the test about the communication of the employees of the company who preceded the test.  Let's go straight to the results.  Moreover, I personally failed to attend there, unfortunately, because the fight against swine <br>  gripper forced me to limit myself to remote participation in the organization of the event. <br><br>  So, as expected, the system made a very good impression on our visitors. <br><br>  The following points seemed most interesting to them: <br><br>  1) Overall sound quality.  As the Kabibar <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/kapibar/" class="user_link">habrauser</a> put it, he did not expect to hear a similar sound quality from a plastic speaker. <br><br>  2) I liked the sound with pre-processed on hrtf materials.  Although they are usually designed for headphones, three-dimensional effects on the system were more realistic than even in good headphones. <br><br>  In addition, due to the lack of a sense of bandura on the head, the effect was more natural - and therefore it is easier to believe in it. <br><br>  3) The internal hrtf multichannel audio processor also did not disappoint - demonstrating the ability to overtake dolby digital in 3D on the fly. <br><br>  4) The sound of computer and console games made the greatest impression on those who came.  Although in this case it is necessary to take into account that very few people play with the system 5.1.  Therefore, only in contrast with the usual headphones, the result explodes the brain. <br><br>  That's it. <br><br>  It remains only to regret a smaller number of those who came than we initially hoped to collect - although, given the general distrust of the technology mentioned above, nothing surprising. <br><br>  Listen to the system is an opportunity for anyone who wishes so far - inforkomovtsy on their website offer it.  However, they usually have it connected not to the computer and not to the console, but to the home theater.  That is, in games - and this application has most admired the public - now you will not listen. <br><br>  However, if someone has a desire to also check out the sound of the system - write, I will let you know when the stand will be assembled the next time.  It seems that in April, at some exhibition, they are going to demonstrate the system with games. <br><br>  Toward the close - a few photos from the event <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/32a59628/1cc035a6/a8c14061/73e284d3.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/c6032adb/f46dbaa7/955ebd18/90d21649.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/d5af8f8e/6d87ea59/8b38d8b6/e310dd4f.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/06acd184/25c22349/e38895c1/16472219.jpg"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/113456/">https://habr.com/ru/post/113456/</a></p>
