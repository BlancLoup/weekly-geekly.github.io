So, the article is more prosaic and philosophical, rather than technical. <br><br>  Therefore, I do not know to which section it is better to refer this topic - to tablets, to Internet commerce or to humor, citizens are moderators, if necessary, please move to the appropriate place.

      What came of it: <a name="habracut"></a>  read below. <br><br><h4>  Start </h4><br>  It all started just fine :) <br>  When there were 10 minutes left until the end of the action, and there were only 3 devices available, I frantically checked the availability of money on the card for Chinese purchases, quickly registered on this site, found a coupon that allows you to pay another $ 10 and in disbelief of my luck I successfully paid for the purchase Paypal. <br><br>  Screenshot from my account: <br><img src="http://www.habrastorage.com/images/novo801.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Doubts </h4><br>  Doubts began at the moment when the action seemed to be over.  But instead, the term of the action lasted first for 10 hours, and later for another 3 days.  The number of tablets in the warehouse still remained 3. <br>  In the meantime, people on the forums, blessing Fortune, continued to ask for leave from work in order to replenish virtual and real maps in order to contribute to the development of the Chinese economy :) <br><br><h4>  Decoupling </h4><br>  The denouement began to unleash around 15:30 Moscow time, when one of the forum participants contacted the tablet maker, while the rest began to actively torment the support of the Dynodirection. <br><br>  Conversation with a manufacturer representative: <br>  <b>Ruslan</b> says: (15:37:20) <br>  hi Mandy!  I need consultation in this shop sale <a href="http://www.dinodirect.com/tablet-pc-pc-">www.dinodirect.com/tablet-pc-pc-</a> ... Can you believe this price?  // <i>Can you confirm the price of this item?</i> <br>  - <b>Mandy</b> says: (15:38:47) <br>  how much !!!  o_0 // <i>how much?</i>  o_0 <br>  <b>Ruslan</b> says: (15:40:28) <br>  $ 65 - $ 10 coupon = $ 55 think it is cheating // <i>I think this is a hoax</i> <br>  - <b>Mandy</b> says: (15:40:46) <br>  so cheapper !!!  // <i>very cheap !!!</i> <br>  <b>Ruslan</b> says: (15:42:49) <br>  think it is cheating or worth the risk?  // <i>cheating or is it worth the risk?</i> <br>  - <b>Mandy</b> says: (15:43:24) <br>  i donot think worth // <i>I would not dare</i> <br>  <b>Ruslan</b> says: (15:44:49) <br>  but why so cheap?  it is everywhere $ 160-170 // <i>why so cheap?</i>  <i>he costs 160-170 bucks everywhere</i> <br>  - <b>Mandy</b> says: (15:45:30) <br>  yes // <i>yes</i> <br>  - <b>Mandy</b> says: (15:46:06) <br>  so impossible so cheaper // <i>so it is impossible cheap</i> <br><br>  The results of the torment of support were and remained obscure all evening, starting with ‚Äúif paid, we will send‚Äù, through ‚Äúwe will check the correctness of the price‚Äù / ‚Äúwe will make a return‚Äù, ending in the end with the fact that ‚Äúnothing can be said for sure, since  the boss is sleeping. " <br><br>  Free translation of a piece of communication with Dino support: <br>  <b>Otta</b> 21:10:53 <br>  We are so sad, but we have to admit it was our mistake. <br>  <b>Otta</b> 21:11:12 <br>  Our employees are now solving this issue. <br>  <b>Bezbod</b> @ ####. Com 21:11:40 <br>  And what do you think? <br>  <b>Bezbod</b> @ ####. Com 21:19:03 <br>  Will you send the device?  Or will you return the money? <br>  <b>Ott</b> 21:20:51 <br>  I have no idea now <br>  <b>Otta</b> 21:21:00 <br>  we received no response <br>  <b>Bezbod</b> @ ####. Com 21:22:10 <br>  You did not receive a response from anyone?  From the boss?  Maybe he is sleeping now ... <br>  <b>Otta</b> 21:22:33 <br>  Yes <br>  Ota 21:22:36 <br>  You're right <br>  <b>Otta</b> 21:22:44 <br>  From the boss who is sleeping now <br><br>  About the boss "who sleeps" - it was a total paragraph. <br>  Such fun - it cost all the upcoming delays in the return of money. <br>  What was the cost of only the general atmosphere with excitement, when everyone in a hurry ordered one, two, or even three tablets, the story of the boss ‚Äúwho sleeps‚Äù, and subsequent versions that the Chinese brothers collected money for the corporate, or interest-free loan for a month :) <br><br><h4>  Results </h4><br>  The results are still unclear. <br>  The only thing that is clear is: <br><ul><li>  Our people are still cold for free, "... loves fish oil, loses its will at the sound of the flute ..." (c) </li><li>  The tablet does not cost $ 68.  The price was driven in wrong, most likely the one in front was forgotten. </li><li>  In any case, there will be a massive refund. </li><li>  The reputation of the store is undermined very thoroughly. </li><li>  With a hangover after a corporate party, the boss is about to wake up. </li><li>  And then someone will be fired.  Without severance pay and a bag of rice ... </li></ul><br>  I look forward to a denouement, since I myself am a direct participant in general hysteria. <br>  On the results - I will report. <br><br>  Keep your head in sobriety, and the mind in clarity!  Don't get caught :)) <br><br><h4>  Breaking News! </h4><br>  [@] - there should be a picture with a slop. <br><br>  Representative Dino unsubscribed about the following: <br>  Customers who placed the order earlier will get this tablet as usual.  For the customers who received out of stock notification email, we have several ways to solve out.  We have three ways to make up for forum members: <br>  1. We will provide similar high-quality tablets with the cheapest price.  You can choose product exchange with little cost.  (SKU: A3002000GT A3002000BD A3002000EF) <br>  2. 10% value you paid.  You can choose other products on our website. <br>  3. If you want to refund. <br><br>  Free translation: <br>  Dino will send as many tablets as they have, and those who received a notice in the mail that the product is not available, can choose one of three options: <br>  1) Choose another product at a reduced price (SKU: A3002000GT A3002000BD A3002000EF). <br>  2) Get a gift card for the amount of the order + 10% on top. <br>  3) To get a refund, for this you need to live-chat or mail. <br><br>  At the same time, the ‚Äúreduced price‚Äù is very doubtful (since it was previously charged up), the gift card is even more doubtful (taking into account the circumstances), and the chat and mail are crammed with users generating hundreds of anger. <br><br><h4>  Links </h4><br>  <a href="http://www.dinodirect.com/tablet-pc-pc-tablet-mid-mp4-mini-tablet-pc-cortex-a9-tablet-pc.html">Link to the same tablet</a> (price is already fixed) <br>  <a href="http://mysku.ru/blog/discounts/4334.html">Starting a panic</a> (at least for me) - a topic with a share <br>  <a href="http://mysku.ru/forum/viewtopic.php%3Ff%3D5%26t%3D878">Mysku forum</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.ebay-forum.ru/phpBB2/topic112118.html">Ebay forum</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/136131/">https://habr.com/ru/post/136131/</a></p>
