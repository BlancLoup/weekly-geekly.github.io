  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Hello to bloggers from Lev Nikolayevich</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In the life of Sergei Ivanovich occurred during this time their events.  Already with <br>  a year ago his book was finished, the fruit of a six-year labor entitled: <br>  "Experience in reviewing the foundations and forms of statehood in Europe and in Russia."  &lt;...&gt; <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  This book, after careful decoration, was published last year and <br>  sent to booksellers. &lt;...&gt; <br>  But a week passed, another, a third, and there was no noticeable impression in society.  &lt;...&gt; <br>  Sergei Ivanovich was counting on the details of the time needed to write <br>  reviews, but a month went by, another, there was the same silence. &lt;...&gt; <br>  Finally, in the third month, a critical journal appeared in a serious journal. <br>  article.  Sergei Ivanovich knew the author of the article.  He met him once <br>  Golubtsova. <br>  The author of the article was a very young and sick satirist, very lively as <br>  a writer, but extremely little educated and timid in personal relations. <br>  Despite his perfect contempt for the author, Sergei Ivanovich with <br>  perfect respect started reading the article.  The article was terrible. <br>  Obviously, on purpose the feuilletonist understood the whole book as it was impossible <br>  understand her.  But he so cleverly picked up the extracts, that for those who did not read <br>  books (and obviously, almost no one read it), it was completely clear that the whole <br>  the book was nothing but a set of lofty words, and even inappropriate <br>  used (as indicated by question marks), and that the author of the book was <br>  man is completely ignorant.  And all this was so witty that Sergey <br>  Ivanovich himself would not have refused such wit;  but that was terrible. <br>  &lt;...&gt; <br>  ‚ÄúDid I offend him with something?‚Äù Sergei Ivanovich asked himself. <br>  And, remembering how he corrected this young man in a meeting <br>  Sergey Ivanovich, who showed his ignorance of the word, found an explanation of the meaning <br>  articles. <br>  After this article came the dead, and the printed and oral, silence about <br>  the book, and Sergei Ivanovich saw that his six-year work, <br>  it was worked out with such love and work that went without a trace. <br><br>  L.N. Tolstoy <br>  "Anna Karenina" <br>  1873-1877 <br><br>  In my opinion, it is very similar to the emotions that you feel when posting on your blog: anxious waiting for the first comment, and annoyance at the commentator, who did not understand the true meaning of the post, and bewilderment about the familiar little bills.

      Separately pleased with the description of the "young and sick feuilletonist" - in my opinion, great applicable to the portrait of the average inhabitant of the blogosphere and the Internet as a whole. <br><br>  I respect Lev Nikolayevich. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/5913/">https://habr.com/ru/post/5913/</a></p>
