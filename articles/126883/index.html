The client gave me a one-minute description of the company's needs and asked for prices.  I said that the project is interesting to me, but I am not ready to talk now about money until I have a better understanding of what she wants. <br>  It is very good that I did not give out my fee when she asked;  during a personal meeting to discuss the project, it turned out that her starting price for negotiations was two times less than mine.  If I immediately gave prices by phone, I would immediately lose a favorable opportunity.  Negotiation fees are in many ways similar to salary negotiations with an employer.  By delaying the negotiation process and firmly defending my salary, I guaranteed the deal and received the payment I expected. <br>  When I know what the client wants, it is more convenient for me to explain what I can do and justify the price.  Let the customer know what they‚Äôll get for their money.  Remember that you sell your services, and you have to convince the buyer to pay for your price. <br><br><h5>  Do not overcharge </h5><br>  Do not assign too high a price to potential customers, as you may miss the chance.  Start at the price you think is fair and stick to it.  The agreement is reached faster when the consultant starts with high rates and lowers them in order to converge.  I know this because when I was an IT provider, in offers from IT consultants whose prices looked astronomical to me, I did not see any interest. <br>  If you do not know what price to request, ask other consultants how much a certain type of service costs.  Recruitment sites like Craigslist, Elance, Monster and CareerBuilder can also give you an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãprices.  Be aware that fees vary by city. <br><br><h5>  Understand the expectations of your customers. </h5><br>  Ask more open questions, the sooner the better - at a time when you just know the future client and before you agree to do business.  I always ask these: <br>  ‚óè What is your ultimate goal?  How do you know that you have reached your goal? <br>  Client's answer to these questions will help you understand their needs and how you can be measured and assessed. <br>  ‚óè What work has been done so far?  What is the ambush, the pitfalls?  What prevents you from reaching your goals? <br>  If you make a solution to a complex problem, it would be good to know in advance what was done and what problems are there now.  This will help you figure out if you have the right skill set to overcome these obstacles. <br>  ‚óè What kind of work and reporting materials are needed? <br>  Knowing these things will help you focus your efforts and determine your range of actions.

      On the very first day, make an appointment with the manager to discuss your vision of the project: how you plan to achieve your goals, how often you will give feedback to clients about the progress of work, and whether you will communicate via e-mail or meet face to face.  Also discuss with the manager what you plan to do in the first few days of the project, to be sure that you are working in the direction in which you should. <br><br>  I had problems in the past when I worked with consultants who did not understand what they needed to do.  One day, I hired a management consultant to help me assess the organization structure of the IT department and recommend alternatives that would help improve the IT position in the business.  Unfortunately, the consultant focused on evaluation, on team skills, and began to request inadequate information about the staff.  He created excessive friction with the department.  I kicked him out and did all the work myself.  This is exactly what I try to avoid as a consultant when dealing with a hiring manager. <br>  Meeting with the manager is a good opportunity to find out if there are other interested parties here whose opinions you should also consider.  If so, meet them too. <br>  If you do not understand the expectations of customers, and you and they are very much at risk, up to and including dismissal.  And you will never have an order from companies that came on the recommendation of the client who fired you. <br><br><h5>  Do not tackle a project that you cannot complete. </h5><br>  If you have doubts about the availability of the necessary skills, do not take the order, your perseverance means little here. <br>  Tell the client that this project is not for you.  It is better to be honest with yourself and say no to the client than to fail the project.  If you bite off more than you can swallow, you will get stressed, and the risk of failing the project will be very high.  Do not take a project that you can not complete successfully, otherwise you will not get good recommendations from the client. <br>  If you know someone who can do this, recommend it.  Customers always appreciate honesty and trying to help them, and you will remain in their memory for other things. <br><br><h5>  Do not expect the red carpet on the first day </h5><br>  If you have become a consultant, you should say ‚Äúbye‚Äù to managerial ways and say ‚Äúhello‚Äù to submission.  You can wait for anything: some companies will give you a personal workspace;  the others are a nook in the closet.  If you are put in a common room or in a small room - do not be discouraged because of this.  Focus on what you have to do - no matter what status your workplace has. <br>  My first day as a consultant opened my eyes.  This was very different from starting a new job as a permanent employee.  There were no invitations for breakfast from Starbucks coffee with bagels.  I was not even taken to the office.  Instead, they brought me into a small room and left me with what I brought with me.  I had to look for a pen and paper.  Fortunately, I at least had access to all the necessary systems and applications for work.  If you expect your customers to lay a red carpet in front of you, you will be disappointed. <br><br><h5>  Throw managerial habits </h5><br>  Consultants should have the talent to convince others to do the necessary work, as they do not have such organizational strength and power as full-time managers. <br>  Arrogance and omniscience will not help in our case.  I realized that the most effective way to get employees to follow directions is to involve them in decision making.  I gave a presentation with an open plan of events, during which we discussed why I was chosen and what I would do. <br>  I found out that the best goal for such a meeting is to get data for the best outcome of the project.  Money for work pays me, and therefore I make a decision based on the collected data.  I discovered that when I involve people in decision making, I become a more influential figure and employees become more responsible in relation to their own decisions.  If you cannot involve many stakeholders and cannot agree on their views, consulting is not your profile. <br>  Once I accidentally showed my status, and immediately realized this mistake.  I printed all the analytics I did in Excel, on 11x14 inch paper.  The person I handed to the analyst asked me to do it on standard paper.  Since I was used to the assistant doing all this work for me, I asked if his assistant could print the analyst.  She told me that she didn‚Äôt have enough time for this, and therefore I have to do it myself.  At one point, I realized that I was no longer in the position I was in. <br><br><h5>  Avoid banal ideas </h5><br>  Clients always look at you as Copperfield, getting rabbits out of a hat at the moment when they have exhausted all their options. <br>  They expect no less than magic from you - going beyond that which will allow them to increase sales, increase revenues or eliminate costs.  Do not think that you can come with the usual offers.  They pay you for thinking outside the box.  So give free rein to wild creativity.  Your task is to offer the best option, and it is not always easy to implement. <br>  One of my clients planned to implement a web-based solution that allows sellers to communicate with each other in real time.  The solution required Internet access to receive billing information, such as order status, so that they take this information into account in their calls. <br>  The problem was that the sellers refused to use this particular system.  I made the client think of alternative delivery mechanisms that provide sellers with information about the status of the order, customer complaints and new products. <br>  The initial reaction of the client to my decision was negative.  They did not want to consider another mechanism, because they have already made impressive investments in a solution on Internet technologies.  In the end, they agreed to use another technology to present information in real time because it was the best communication tool to speed up sales. <br><br><h5>  Leave a lasting impression about yourself, create a brand </h5><br>  Conversations cost a little in the world of consulting.  You must create a brand.  You are an intellectual worker who sells his services and demonstrates how you can increase income.  You should be perceived as an expert with specific skills that the client organization does not have.  Creating a brand will help you create a unique identification that distinguishes you from the legion of other independent consultants. <br>  You can create your brand through: <br>  ‚Ä¢ Writing articles in the field in which you specialize <br>  ‚Ä¢ Presentations at presentations <br>  ‚Ä¢ Writing a book will give you an instant resource of trust. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Create a regular blog. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Development of professional networks in the field of your specialization. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Best results (reputation is very important). <br>  Don't focus too much on making money.  The purpose of these actions is to make your name.  The money will come later. <br><br>  While I was becoming a consultant, doubts did not leave me - is it mine?  I lost the sense of belonging that was when I worked full time.  Your work is short term and everyone knows that.  Believe me, they will forget you as soon as you leave.  In the meantime, I understood a lot about the ability to sell myself, the impact on people and the use of various technologies that were invaluable in my subsequent accomplishments. <br><br>  About the author: Kamala Puram is the president of Chrysalis International, a management consulting company.
