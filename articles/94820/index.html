  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Show your best</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In our company for the last month 3 new vacancies were opened.  We posted information about them on job sites and forums.  Candidates were asked to send a resume by e-mail and, if we like it, we invited the person for an interview. <br>  During these events, it turned out that 70% of people simply do not know how to file themselves.  Errors begin at the letter stage to the potential employer. <br><br>  <b>Letter</b> <br>  Many letters came without a summary.  That is, in the spirit, - hello, I Peter can do this and that in one paragraph.  One girl signed by a nickname, many have no contacts other than email. <br>  It surprises me that people are not able to compose a normal resume in a Word file with places of study, work and skills.  Insert a small photo in the resume, it will not be superfluous. <br>  Some sent a normal resume, but there was not a word in the letter.  Only theme and file attachment.  At a minimum, the phrase ‚Äúhello, I am sending you a resume for consideration‚Äù should be present. <br>  Another mistake is to write skills that have nothing to do with a job.  For example, a girl applying for the position of seo-specialist writes that she has skills in Corel Draw and 3D-Max.  Why this is necessary, I'm not looking for a designer! <br>  If you are asked to attach a list of projects that the programmer has implemented, then it probably is not just that.  And the answers in the spirit - this project is a commercial secret, and this one can be seen only in my home on a computer of trust does not cause anything. <br>  There is no point in talking about literacy, although there are also letters with errors. <br><br>  After reading the resume should be only one desire - to call a person on the phone and invite for an interview.  After more letters, there are only a lot of clarifying questions.  Even if a person is able, he does not show it.  In the case when there are a lot of candidates, then such an applicant will simply be eliminated, although his skills may not be a bit lower than the others.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>Interview</b> <br>  Before the interview, read the site of the employer, learn more about it.  The fact that you have not even looked at the site shows disinterest in work. <br>  Don't be late.  And if you are late or lost in search of an office, be sure to call and warn.  One person came 15 minutes later.  When asked why he was late, he replied - "To be honest, I had lunch."  That is, clearly showed that he put on this interview, lunch is more important. <br>  Stay confident when talking, look the other person in the eye.  No, not intently, not looking up, but also not so that the look is constantly on the floor or on the handle on the table. <br>  Employers like to ask why you chose our company, why you want to engage in this type of activity, to work in this position.  Prepare for these questions.  It is not at all to the benefit of the candidate, when it is clear that he does not care where to work, but in the eyes it reads - ‚Äúgive at least some work, they don‚Äôt take it as a manager, I‚Äôll go to the salesmen‚Äù <br><br>  Everything I have written has long been known; I have not revealed any secrets here.  But, why, then, up to 70% of people who are not applying for the position of a seller in a kiosk, but are looking for a job in an IT-company (such as should be modern literate people) admit such blunders? <br><br>  PS  We found a project manager and programmer.  But we still need a clever and sociable seo-specialist in an office (Volgograd), who is able and fond of promoting websites.  <a href="http://magwai.ru/page/ischem_seo">Read more</a> about the vacancy. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/94820/">https://habr.com/ru/post/94820/</a></p>
