And it is natural. <br><br>  Comments like "SEO litter the Internet, spit on their faces, hate them, don't give them a hand," found on Habr√©, I also understand.  Letters like ‚ÄúYour site is not well searched in search engines‚Äù I also receive.  I can't stand them either. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Undoubtedly, debris in Runet due to some optimizers accumulated a large pile.  But no less was the result of the work of other "experts" - inept webmasters, doorkeepers, careless site owners who have long abandoned their resources.  The only advantage of them is the resistance of search engines to this kind of content.

      On the other hand, to evaluate in this way any community is somewhat ... strange.  This is about the same as saying that all programmers are sloppy bearded men and they see nothing but glands (by the way, I am a programmer by the way). <br><br>  I say that all this is a city that is visible, made by specific people.  And it is the negative that is noticeable in the first place, so you shouldn‚Äôt judge all by bad examples.  The threshold of entry into this area is quite low, because of this, all the troubles. <br><br>  The time of "wild" SEO, in my opinion, is approaching the sunset.  In the West, not positions are selling for a long time, but experience in creating successful projects and simply high-quality websites, and SEO-specialists know and know much more than banal buying links and writing meta tags. <br><br>  Starting with a "techie" who knows how to correctly select search queries and make good SEO footcloths for a site, one way or another, you end up with what sites really need to do for people.  And to attract visitors there are lots of ways.  Interesting.  Nontrivial. <br><br>  And besides, with sane customers, you can get really high-quality content, because the client is a professional in his business.  It remains only to teach him the specifics of presenting materials on the Internet.  This is a difficult task, primarily because it is necessary to change the consciousness of the client.  But in the end for the year you can get a very good resource, visited and with a small bounce rate. <br><br>  I may be idealizing and dreaming too much, but ... I want to work with a high-quality result, because I‚Äôm a Runet user, like the others, and crazy texts from the series ‚Äúsale of mattresses are our everything, because we like to sell mattresses‚Äù not high. <br><br>  Actually, I just want to discuss the themes of creating successful Internet projects in our blog, because  I am sure that the habrasoobshchestvo are the most advanced in Internet technologies people who know how to listen, and on which the future of Runet depends as a result. <br><br>  Maybe my <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/onlinepro/blog/107640/">second</a> message will be a little different? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/107642/">https://habr.com/ru/post/107642/</a></p>
