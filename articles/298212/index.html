  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Cyber ‚Äã‚ÄãMonday in Russian: overpricing and low discounts</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c01/308/c17/c01308c1703543788ae9a2e548e649e0.jpg"><br><br>  Yandex.Market analyzed prices on the day of online discounts on January 25, organized by the Association of E-commerce Companies (ACIT), and more than 100 domestic online stores participated in the campaign.  The results of the study were quite expected for the Russian online market. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  According <a href="http://www.vedomosti.ru/business/articles/2016/01/26/625522-kiberponedelnik">to</a> Vedomosti, Yandex.Market specialists analyzed the prices of goods at ten large online stores that took part in the sale and posted their offers on the official sale site Cmonday.ru.  Among them were such giants as Euroset, Yulmart, Wikimart, Technopark, Media Markt and others.  The prices on the day of the action (January 25) were compared with the cost of goods as of Thursday, January 21. <br><br>  As analysts of Yandex.Market found out, only every tenth product was offered discounts in one size or another.  But 18% of the range of online stores that participated in the domestic version of Cyber ‚Äã‚ÄãMonday, went up.  The biggest discounts were in the segment of small household appliances, and the average discount amounted to 14%.  At the same time, the decrease in prices was recorded mainly for unpopular goods, and with the positions in demand, the situation was exactly the opposite.  For example, only 8% of the popular TV models could be purchased with discounts, but 16% of the ‚Äúin-demand‚Äù product range became more expensive.

      Alexey Fedorov, President of the Association of E-commerce Companies, constantly insists that prices are rising due to the weakening ruble.  According to Fedorov, retailers "made a miracle", reducing prices by 14%, while margins are on average 7-10%. <br><br>  In general, the sales turnover of Cyber ‚Äã‚ÄãMonday participants amounted to about 9 billion rubles, which is slightly less than the forecast of 11.5 billion predicted by the same Fedorov. According to the president of AKIT, online stores are satisfied with the action, which allowed them to get more buyers.  A significant increase in conversions from Yandex.Market to store sites (75% compared with the results of a week ago) was also confirmed by the project manager Pavel Aleshin.  At the same time, as <a href="http://www.rbc.ru/technology_and_media/26/01/2016/56a755139a794740ccd786e7">shown by</a> the RBC survey, many owners of online stores, who took part in the action, are disappointed with the event, as they expected sales growth several times. <br><br>  Buyers also recorded complaints about the unfair behavior of stores, technical problems and the lack of goods.  Thus, a number of buyers who made a purchase in the Detsky Mir online store said that after adding a product to the cart, the system reported that the product was not available.  Representatives of the store responded that popular items simply sold out very quickly, noting the increase in the number of orders on the site five times. <br><br>  Domestic Cyber ‚Äã‚ÄãMonday is held in RuNet for the fourth time.  For the first time, Russian users had the opportunity to try out an analogue of the well-known Cyber ‚Äã‚ÄãMonday action, originally from the USA on January 28, 2013.  All this time, the campaign was held under the auspices of the Association of E-commerce Companies, and, presumably, ACIT will continue to organize Cyber ‚Äã‚ÄãMonday and in the future.  It is hoped that next time users will be given more discounts. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/298212/">https://habr.com/ru/post/298212/</a></p>
