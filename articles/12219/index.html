  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Thousands Hi-Tech</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <strong><u>Thousands of hi-tech</u></strong> <br>  Belarusians spend more money on IT products <br>  If you think that your computer is for $ 1000, an active stereo pair for $ 300 and a TV for $ 500 is the limit of perfection, then you are seriously mistaken.  Computer store managers told us what very rich people are interested in and how much they spend on it. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  The Belarusian business elite, according to the sellers, prefers "not to shine", and therefore it often prefers expensive jewelry and clothes from world famous designers to new items and exclusive solutions from IT companies.  Firstly, expensive technological toys ‚Äúdo not so clearly indicate wealth as decorations,‚Äù and secondly, ‚Äúthere is a real pleasure from them, besides boasting.‚Äù  As an employee of one of the capital's shops, Andrew, tells us, once a retired Air Force pilot came to them.  He said that of all computer games, he only likes the "IL-2 Stormtrooper", because it is very similar to reality.  And ordered a system unit, an expensive joystick for $ 300, and four monitors.  A video card, which is installed in two slots at once, was brought specially from Moscow for two weeks - they were not even sold from us.  In general, the computer to the colonel cost $ 4,000.  ‚ÄúWhen we asked why we need four monitors,‚Äù continues Andrei, he smugly smugly: ‚ÄúI‚Äôll put two monitors in the center and one at a time in the corners.  And then I put the view from the cockpit in the game, I want to look at the left side, just turn my head to the left, I want the right - right.  And no extra clicks on the keyboard.  Conveniently!". <br>  According to the assurances of other sellers, Belarusians began to treat the installation of home theaters in a different way.  The head of a large wholesale company, Vladimir, says that ‚ÄúEpson projectors and plasma panels (for the most part, Panasonic) have finally begun to be sold.  At the same time, the dealer notes, there is no demand for middle-class models: ‚ÄúWe take either the cheapest projectors for $ 900 and plasma TVs up to $ 2,000 for the last money, or the most expensive ones - for $ 5,000.  Buyers of the latter, the price is usually not interested at all.  Such people simply come and say: ‚ÄúThe best, but the price does not interest!‚Äù.  Another interesting tendency: ‚ÄúThis year was the first when our people became seriously interested in LCD-TVs.  Each store consistently sells 2-3 pcs.  per month ‚Äù- the seller rejoices in the security of the Belarusians.  Now, on the eve of the Christmas holidays, their sales have particularly jumped.  In addition to the good big screen, the wealthy Belarusians began to buy very expensive acoustic systems.  ‚ÄúA builder came to us somehow for an uninterruptible power supply and took the most expensive one for $ 200, says manager Dmitry. He needs him only to protect his speakers from our unreliable power grids, which he bought for $ 8,000.  At the same time, he put as much into the walls in the room - so that the sound did not resonate.  Coupled with a TV for $ 4000 comes half of the apartment!  And all this is located in a separate room of 28 square meters, especially for watching movies! ‚Äù <br>  And yet, according to managers, the main "ponte" among businessmen is considered an expensive laptop, along with the most "tricked" PDA / Communicator.  ‚ÄúWhen we put a laptop from Fujitsu-Siemens worth BR11 million without VAT, we were sure that it would remain our decoration for the next year,‚Äù Dmitry continues, but then one casino owner looked in and was not confused for a second , asked to pack. "  And the Belarusians have become fashionable to use Apple's Macintosh computers: they look stunning, and their owner once again underlines that he is not ‚Äúlike everyone else.‚Äù  Although the price of this ‚Äúponta‚Äù is not so big - from $ 1,000 to $ 3,000 - you can always ‚Äúdraw‚Äù in front of your friends. <br>  Rich people do not stint on gifts to godparents: ‚ÄúWe have a client to whom we supply equipment to work.  Engaged in real estate.  One day comes and says: ‚ÄúI have a godfather, I have two children, I need to collect two computers today.  I said to him: wait until Monday, cheap components will arrive, but now everyone has already sold out. ‚Äù  He shrugs: ‚ÄúCollect from what is.  As a result, each computer cost him Br4 million. He immediately paid for it, loaded the systems into the car and went to visit. ‚Äù <br>  A customer-priest struck a sales assistant in one of the mobile phone shops: ‚ÄúHe came to us for a Nokia 8800 smartphone worth $ 1,300 - as it turned out, to his son.  He turned himself and pulled Vertu with gold trim out of his cassock!  As far as I know, even most large businessmen do not have such phones.  So now I don‚Äôt have stereotypes about the earnings of the clergy! ‚Äú <habracut>  . </habracut></div>
