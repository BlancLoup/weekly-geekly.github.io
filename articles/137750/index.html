  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Live Wallpaper - Pros and Cons</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Owners of devices released some time ago, sometimes think about the fact that they would not interfere with the support of live wallpaper, if the standard firmware can not boast of this opportunity.  As a rule, they find a solution, but is it really necessary to have spectacular live wallpapers in everyday use of the device? <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b45/24f/500/b4524f500174d079a185820841d1371d.jpeg"></div><br>  We'll start by looking at typical scenarios for using this type of background image and sources to replenish your wallpaper collection, and eventually try to answer the question posed above.  In addition, tips on choosing and installing live wallpapers may be helpful to novice users. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  If your phone has support for this personalization method, just go to the ‚ÄúPersonalization‚Äù menu and select ‚ÄúLive Wallpaper‚Äù as your wallpaper.  The list is implemented as a "carousel", and having decided on the choice, you should click the "Preview" button.  By choosing a simple wallpaper, you can only accept the current version by viewing it on the central desktop, and many settings are available for individual instances. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5bc/6af/41e/5bc6af41e5c84541d37ce9132491bdff.jpeg"></div><br>  Of course, this depends on the specific instance of the program that you like, but as a rule, beautiful landscapes and views, as well as abstract moving images, are popular as wallpapers.  The reaction to touch and tilt of the device, as well as the intensity of the use of system resources, can be changed.

      There are also fully interactive wallpapers with a wide range of settings.  For example, Shake Them All Live Wallpaper allows you to enjoy the company of green robots familiar to all of us, the number, size, color and even the appearance of which can be changed to your discretion.  Of course, they react to touch and reposition of the apparatus in space, but are distinguished by relatively high resource intensity. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/667/708/af3/667708af39c922e4196e2879ce690e1f.jpeg"></div><br>  Among the many options come across and very useful from a practical point of view.  So, live wallpaper with a fragment of Google maps will help you quickly navigate the terrain, without going into any application. <br><br>  The overwhelming majority of wallpapers are designed to decorate your desktops and give the right mood in anticipation of certain events.  Christmas and festive wallpapers, which raise the mood and lead to the desired mood, are in special demand. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f1e/32b/413/f1e32b4138f18a537294c127a072f258.jpeg"></div><br>  The most vivid wallpapers from third-party developers that fully bring the atmosphere of a holiday or a sunny beach to your smartphone are, of course, Christmas HD and My Beach HD from DualBoot Games.  You can try out these ways of customizing the interface on free versions, and the developers have already brought to your attention a number of other equally worthy alternatives.  Despite the well-developed picture, the wallpaper does not reduce the user's perception of the performance of the phone and does not affect the overall stability of the work. <br><br>  A very pleasant impression was also left by the wallpaper from Kittehface Software, in particular, more than ever Snowfall Live Wallpaper.  One does not expect to see such an outstanding elaboration of details from the background image.  We hope that other products of this developer are made on the same high level. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f29/f46/fca/f29f46fca552a7d961724b337c121eac.jpeg"></div><br>  The limited resources of even the most modern devices impose their requirements on the use of certain "decorations", so that with extremely active use of the phone, the desktops of which are filled with many widgets, you may have to give up live wallpaper.  On devices with an average level of performance, if the amount of free memory is at least 80-90 MB, you can use live wallpapers without fear for the fate of the device and the possible negative impact on important indicators for you. <br><br>  This way of personalization doesn‚Äôt have a special impact on the battery life, and taking into account the fact that, on average, users charge their Android smartphones once a day, you won‚Äôt notice a difference. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/dc5/4ac/96c/dc54ac96c1a6ca112e84b38881fcc762.jpeg"></div><br><br>  With the performance figured out, but what about the stability of the work as a whole?  In the overwhelming majority of cases, abnormal situations should not occur even when using certain wallpapers from third-party developers.  Otherwise, you can always return to the standard options offered by the manufacturer, but this probability should be considered only as an exception. <br>  The sense of beauty is a deeply subjective parameter, and we do not undertake to give advice on customizing the appearance of a particular device.  Moreover, the Android OS is famous for allowing you to change the interface "by itself" in the smallest details.  One of them can be some kind of live wallpaper, without which you, literally, feel ill at ease. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/604/a0d/46a/604a0d46a964dac1c2c7a077bffa5b98.jpeg"></div><br>  Install them and enjoy excellent effects, changing the time of day, wind blows and drops of water.  We only hope that your joy will not be overshadowed by a sharp decrease in battery charge or an unexpected shutdown of the device in the case of using wallpaper that has compatibility problems with a specific device. <br><br>  The following third-party programs and developers were mentioned in the review: <br><br>  Kittehface Software: <a href="https://market.android.com/developer%3Fpub%3DKittehface%2BSoftware">market.android.com/developer?pub=Kittehface+Software</a> <br><br>  Free install Snowfall Free Live Wallpaper: <br>  <a href="https://market.android.com/details%3Fid%3Dfishnoodle.snowfall_free">market.android.com/details?id=fishnoodle.snowfall_free</a> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/62f/ab6/7f8/62fab67f8cb59fb5c4b9ebedcb30dc94.gif"></div><br><br>  Buy Snowfall Live Wallpaper full version for $ 0.99: <br>  <a href="https://market.android.com/details%3Fid%3Dfishnoodle.snowfall">market.android.com/details?id=fishnoodle.snowfall</a> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/97c/451/e38/97c451e383a8c7f42cdf77453b08c010.gif"></div><br><br>  DualBoot Games: <a href="https://market.android.com/developer%3Fpub%3DDualBoot%2BGames">market.android.com/developer?pub=DualBoot+Games</a> <br><br>  Free to install My Beach Free: <br>  <a href="https://market.android.com/details%3Fid%3Dcom.dualboot.apps.beachfree">market.android.com/details?id=com.dualboot.apps.beachfree</a> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/df0/621/177/df062117798db3aa1d991ca4d955b74f.gif"></div><br><br>  Buy the full version of My Beach HD for $ 0.99: <br>  <a href="https://market.android.com/details%3Fid%3Dcom.dualboot.apps.beach">market.android.com/details?id=com.dualboot.apps.beach</a> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/bd0/110/5ea/bd01105ea5caed1cab40046a97b2038d.gif"></div><br><br>  Free install Shake Them All Live Wallpaper from the developer Yougli: <br>  <a href="https://market.android.com/details%3Fid%3Dnet.yougli.shakethemall">market.android.com/details?id=net.yougli.shakethemall</a> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/828/01e/2f0/82801e2f0d4a18a49445ba34224d643b.gif"></div></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/137750/">https://habr.com/ru/post/137750/</a></p>
