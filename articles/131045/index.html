If for some reason you cannot recognize it, you can get the same information by typing the barcode manually and pressing ‚Äúsearch‚Äù in the ApplicationBar. <br>  I had this idea every time I visited a bookstore, I liked the book, but did not like its price.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br>  In two days, it turned out to be a completely working prototype, in the server part of which there are now about 3 million records for 4 stores connected at the moment. <br>  Unfortunately I couldn‚Äôt connect books.ru - where I usually buy the cheapest and where I buy often - I registered an affiliate program on Friday, but I had to send a request and wait for confirmation.  At midnight on Friday, there was apparently no one to confirm. <br><br>  Screenshots with the storyboard work: <br><table><tbody><tr><td><img src="http://akhmed-ru.1gb.ru/wp7BookShopImages/1.png" width="240" height="400"></td><td><img src="http://akhmed-ru.1gb.ru/wp7BookShopImages/2.png" width="240" height="400"></td><td><img src="http://akhmed-ru.1gb.ru/wp7BookShopImages/3.png" width="240" height="400"></td><td><img src="http://akhmed-ru.1gb.ru/wp7BookShopImages/4.png" width="240" height="400"></td></tr></tbody></table><br><br>  The project was liked by many participants, many were interested in how and what was done - they were most interested in the project‚Äôs ‚Äútrick‚Äù - scanning barcodes. <br><br>  I want to express a special thanks to everyone who watched the development process, everyone who watched my project and warm reviews.  Despite the fact that my project did not win anything - I still decided to publish the source code of the client part, which caused the greatest interest <br><br>  Traditionally, the source code of the project on codeplex: <br><br>  <a href="http://bookshop.codeplex.com/releases/view/75618">http://bookshop.codeplex.com/releases/view/75618</a> <br><br>  In this version, due to an error in constructing the index by name, I turned off the search by name on the server, saving the search chip by barcode. <br>  In the near future I will make corrections both in the server and in the client part. <br><br>  During the report, I got a little worried and forgot to show a slide with the mail and say that all WP7 owners who have no unlock and who want to try the application on their phone, can take part in the beta test of the application, which I laid out in the marketplace, sending me mail (sherievakhmed@gmail.com) your LiveId, marked ‚ÄúBookShop test‚Äù, in response, I will add an account for access and send a link from zune. <br><br>  <b>Out of topic</b> <br>  Since I finished my project on Saturday closer to the evening and loafed around, I decided to join another team of two girls with an interesting idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe ‚ÄúSuper map‚Äù project, but without a developer.  On the last day, joining the team as a developer, within 2-3 hours he helped them to make a draft of the prototype also on WP7.  As luck would have it, 10 minutes before the start of the award procedure, the girls decided to leave, asking me to pick up the prize if they won anything.  Fortunately, our team won.  Unfortunately, the team received a prize with an accent that it was a female team.  Under the universal gag, I had to pick up the gorgeous HTC Titan phone.  Despite the unpleasant incident, I was glad that this team received a prize.  The phone really turned out to be really thin with a big screen and very cool.  Of course, I returned the phone to the leader of the team, after taking a photo with this magnificent phone.  But now I know which phone I will buy next time. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/131045/">https://habr.com/ru/post/131045/</a></p>
