I am writing one more thing, but silence is the answer.  Finally, I am writing a third with a text like, ‚ÄúDude, are you still interested in our cooperation?‚Äù.  Here I get the answer: "I can not wait when we start working, we were going to the presentation."  I try to build my correspondence according to certain principles in order to shift communication from a dead center.  In the article I will share some of my own workings, I will tell you how to <s>get out of silence for loving</s> addressees, and they reciprocated. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/5b/fb/wg/5bfbwgjdx4zj6eravngdvbml36g.jpeg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Each corporate culture has its own rules.  Somewhere you will be answered at least on the same day or in the morning of the next day, while in others you can wait for an answer for weeks.  If you, of course, do not put extra effort. <br><br><h2>  Use two days rule </h2><br>  It is important that you do not forget about.  And you yourself did not forget that you need something from someone.  There are comrades who write that they need an answer very urgently and disappear for a month.  Funny, yes?  To avoid becoming a sleeping beauty yourself, set reminders and let it become a habit.

      Every morning, as soon as the working laptop is loaded, I do an audit of emails that I haven‚Äôt received an answer the day before.  For each such letter on in two working days I put a reminder in the mail client.  A couple of days pass, a notification pops up, I check that there hasn‚Äôt been a response so far and I‚Äôm writing another letter.  And so I repeat once or twice.  If the answer is no - call.  But situations are different and sometimes I call after the first reminder.  IT Depend, in short. <br><br><h2>  Become a cyborg reminder </h2><br>  Each time to write "Unfortunately I did not receive an answer from you and bla-bla-bla" frankly zadolbalo.  Why not automate this routine operation?  It turns out that in each operating system there is an autochange or you can put a specialized <a href="https://www.alfredapp.com/">Alfred</a> . <br><br>  I am working on correspondence with two large groups of recipients: colleagues and customers.  I prepared the text for autochange for each group.  And for each iteration I make a reminder in which I write the date of the previous iteration.  As the number of iterations grows, I increase the degree of the text.  Let's start with colleagues. <br><table><tbody><tr><td>  <b>Iteration</b> <br></td><td>  <b>Text</b> <br></td><td>  <b>AutoCorrect</b> <br></td></tr><tr><td>  one <br></td><td>  "Hello!  Peter, unfortunately did not receive from you an answer to his previous letter.  I'm really looking forward to it, and without it I can‚Äôt do this and that. ‚Äù <br></td><td>  Npmkl1 <br></td></tr><tr><td>  2 <br></td><td>  "Hello!  Peter, I really appreciate your time, but for me it is very important to get an answer from you because of something.  If you do not answer me, our customer will go into the sunset and we will not see him again. ‚Äù <br></td><td>  Npmkl2 </td></tr><tr><td>  3 <br></td><td>  "Hello!  Peter, if you do not have time to answer, please write to whom I can contact.  To detain the answer to the customer because of our internal delays I consider fufufu ‚Äù. <br></td><td>  NCM3 <br></td></tr></tbody></table><br>  If you have colleagues with whom you communicate more informally, you can prepare separate templates. <br><br>  We turn to customers.  Here, of course, it is important to maintain a more formal tone.  I think that the auto-replacement thing is more suitable for correspondence with the customer.  A colleague in most cases is still easier to call. <br><table><tbody><tr><td>  <b>Iteration</b> <br></td><td>  <b>Text</b> <br></td><td>  <b>AutoCorrect</b> <br></td></tr><tr><td>  one <br></td><td>  "Good day!  Peter, unfortunately did not receive from you an answer to his previous letter.  I‚Äôm really looking forward to hearing from you, so we can help with your question as soon as possible. ‚Äù <br></td><td>  Npmzkz1 <br></td></tr><tr><td>  2 <br></td><td>  "Good day!  Peter, we have already been able to do this and that.  To go to the step of such and such, we need to get from you this and that.  Please let me know how relevant this question is for you now. ‚Äù <br></td><td>  Npmzkz2 </td></tr><tr><td>  3 <br></td><td>  "Good day!  Peter, please tell us if we can continue to communicate on the issue.  If I'm writing to the wrong address, let me know who to contact for discussion.  We can also talk a question over the phone or postpone a question for a while.  What shall we do? <br><br>  PS If we postpone the question, write when you can write again about it. <br></td><td>  Npmzkz3 <br></td></tr></tbody></table><br>  The time between iterations can be varied.  For example, it may take three days before the first iteration, two days before the second, and one before the third.  Everything is also very dependent on the situation and the choice of intervals for each person is better to set your own. <br><br>  Do not allow raids in reminder letters.  It is not necessary to write "This is already my second reminder, but there is still no answer from you."  It is better to write how important it is for you to get an answer and how it will help your addressee. <br><br><h2>  Increase the addressee's motivation to answer you </h2><br>  I have many times encountered the lack of an answer due to two reasons: <br>  - the addressee did not understand why he needed this letter, what it has to do with it and how it can help; <br>  - in the letter there is no explicit question. <br><br>  These moments are clarified in the process of phoning a few days after the first letter.  Time is an irreplaceable resource, so always check the clarity of your syllable and the presence of a targeted action for the addressee at the end of the letter. <br><br><h2>  Write a clear subject of the letter and do not manipulate </h2><br>  Letters with the subject ‚ÄúUrgent!‚Äù, ‚ÄúSolution of the Question‚Äù, ‚ÄúCommercial Offer‚Äù and the like do not have their own face.  This topic is even difficult to remember.  I always point out the most informative topic.  This will then help when calling to remind the addressee about exactly which letter is being referred to. <br><br>  Do not write ‚ÄúThank you in advance‚Äù or ‚ÄúThank you for a prompt reply‚Äù at the end of the letter - this is a manipulation.  It is better to write why it is important for you to get an answer as soon as possible. <br><br>  I hope these tips will help improve the conversion of your correspondence. <br><br>  Tell me about your methods, I am sure that there are even more vigorous ways to get an answer as soon as possible. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/350556/">https://habr.com/ru/post/350556/</a></p>
