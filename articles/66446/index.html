However, as in many other similar clients, Mail.ru is not enough here. <br>  The client itself is both simple and convenient, and very functional.  With the program comes a standard set of modules, and the program itself is not deprived of chips.  This is exactly what distinguishes Pidgin from other programs - there are ‚Äúchips‚Äù that are difficult to see somewhere else.  Well, for example, "user tracking", which greatly expands the possibilities of notification.  There are some individual settings, for example, some that do not have enough of the function of installing your own avatar, instead of an avatar that the interlocutor offers you. <br>  Of course, the client needs to have meta-contacts with so many protocols, and even with this task, Pidgin copes. <br>  It seemed that nowhere to throw a spoonful of tar, but no!  Pidgin has shortcomings: these are statuses and the absence of a ‚Äúreview of services‚Äù.  Yes, the statuses in Pidgin standard work fine, but no activities, moods, or, more understandable to ICQ users, xStatus, were not planned.  This is how it is.  <i>Habrouser <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/havok/" class="user_link">HaVok</a> tells you that the statuses are promised in version <a href="http://developer.pidgin.im/ticket/4508">2.7.0</a> , you just have to wait and hope.</i>  <i>Pocachto protocols do not support extended statuses</i> <br>  A ‚ÄúService Overview‚Äù is needed, for example, to add a transport.  Although on the other hand, it is a multi-protocol client, transports will not be needed here in most cases. <br>  The client himself is suitable for the ‚Äúaverage user‚Äù, but no more than that, since there is no possibility to modify the interface. <br><br>  <b>For whom</b> : <br><ul><li>  For those who like a fairly simple interface with good functionality and a variety of protocols. </li><li>  Who needs a lot of protocols, and the statuses are not interested. </li><li>  For those who have a working Gnome environment </li></ul><br><br><br><br><br><h4>  Empathy </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f3b/f43/b16/f3bf43b16957dd9a3aa3ce0cbf045625.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Version: <b>2.27.5</b> <br>  Protocols: <b>XMPP</b> (Jabber), <b>ICQ</b> , SIP, AIM, MSN, QQ, Yahoo, GroupWise, Gadu-Gadu, Salut <br>  OS: Unix-like <br>  Website: <a href="http://live.gnome.org/Empathy">http://live.gnome.org/Empathy</a> <br><br>  The program turned out to be so simple that there is nothing to ‚Äúreview‚Äù it. <br>  In general, the program looks like it would be Pidgin at the time of the start of development.  This feeling arises due to the contrast of the functionality and interface.  The interface is <i>terribly minimalistic</i> , it is as simple as 5 kopecks, so simple that even the icons of contacts of different protocols do not differ!  Looking at my list, do not think what I like when I have a sheet of paper in front of me; it‚Äôs just impossible to make it narrower than the contact list.  And by functionality, I mean the number of protocols supported, including voice communication over <b>SIP</b> and <b>Google Talk</b> .  In addition, immediately after the installation, the program accurately determined that I had profiles set up in Pidgin, and just as successfully (with my permission) imported them. <br>  Naturally, this item does not support any additional statuses.  But even worse, the ‚ÄúServices Overview‚Äù is not supported, so you will not be able to work with Jabber transports. <br><br>  <b>For whom</b> : <br><ul><li>  For those who can not stand the clutter of the interface, but at the same time wants to sit in many networks at the same time. </li></ul><br><br><br><br><br><h4>  IMadering </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/719/157/c06/719157c0678fce8f084b88d78d9108c4.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Version: <b>5.0.0 alfa</b> (07/30/09, updated to 08/06/09) <br>  Protocols: <b>ICQ</b> <br>  OC: Windows <br>  Size: 1.2 MB <br>  It takes memory: 10 MB <br>  Website: <a href="http://imadering.com/">imadering.com</a> <br><br>  Seeing this program, I was shocked!  Memories instantly flooded when QIP was simpler, the air is cleaner, and the girls are more beautiful ... Alas, it turned out that the program is at a very early stage of development.  No, in fact, it had already developed a long time ago, but the author decided to start the project again, and therefore I was at first slightly surprised that the jabber wasn‚Äôt connecting, and then I felt lonely after seeing the <i><b>absolute</b> lack of settings</i> .  Despite this, the client seems to be under active development, many features of the ICQ protocol are already supported (including the x-statuses). <br><br>  <b>For whom</b> : <br><ul><li>  Those who stupidly need to talk in ICQ, as in the good old days. </li><li>  Run the "left" numbers (sometimes you need to exit the "unknown" number and write to someone, or check something ...) </li><li>  Carry a flash drive ... just in case </li></ul><br><br><br><br><br><h4>  Kopete </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8b0/fdd/68a/8b0fdd68a1a6ddae7526f485a957fdee.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Version: 0.70.2 (2.04.09) <br>  Protocols: <b>ICQ</b> , <b>Jabber</b> , AIM, Yahoo, Windows Live, QQ, Gadu-Gadu, Bonjour, GroupWise, Meanwhile, SMS, WinPopup (description: sends WinPopup messages) <br>  OS: <b>Unix-like</b> <br>  It occupies memory: 27 MB <br>  Website: <a href="http://kopete.kde.org/">kopete.kde.org</a> <br><br>  Answer Pidgin'u?  Or Pidgin answer Kopete?  I do not know, but this is a <b>monster</b> , and very impressive.  Unlike Pidgin, Kopete lacks the elegant handling of the settings in different corners.  All settings fall out from somewhere in the menus or can be found on some tab, or hidden in a separate menu in a separate line in a separate window ... In general, despite the apparent simplicity, the client is surprised with his pop-up-out-crawl settings.  It is generally something good, because no one has yet died from a flexible client :) Moreover, Kopete supports <i>x-statuses</i> and <i>moods</i> (although I didn‚Äôt see any <i>activities</i> there). <br>  Kopete's problem is its KDE focus.  I admit that in KDE it looks beautiful and probably fits into the interface, but in Gnome it is out of place and it even sometimes seems to me that it slows down.  Besides, who wants to drag a bunch of KDE's libraries?  (I‚Äôm talking about the total traffic required to download the program). <br><br>  <b>For whom</b> : <br><ul><li>  For KDE users </li><li>  For the rest of the Unix-users who love many features in one bottle </li></ul><br><br><br><br><br><h4>  SIM </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c89/343/0cd/c893430cdecba66362ebc1868730a88a.png" alt="image"><br>  Version: 0.9.5.2 (11/28/08) <br>  Protocols: <b>ICQ</b> , <b>Jabber</b> , AIM, MSN, Yahoo, LiveJournal <br>  OS: Windows, Linux, FreeBSD <br>  It occupies memory: 12 MB <br>  Website: <a href="http://sim-im.org/">sim-im.org</a> <br><br>  Quite a strange project, I can not name any features.  There are downsides: the interface is bad and there are no x-statuses, but I don‚Äôt see any advantages.  Just a program.  There are some of their own chips, but they are few and they are not worthy of mention. <br>  In addition, the client is focused more on KDE and does not seem to develop. <br><br>  <b>For whom</b> : <br><ul><li>  It's hard to say, probably not for anyone </li></ul><br><br><br><br><br><h4>  Gajim </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/185/767/eb4/185767eb4b388e48afb80a86e5647d4d.png" alt="image"><br>  Version: 0.12.3 (12.06,09) <br>  Protocols: Jabber <br>  OS: Linux, BSD, Windows <br>  Memory occupancy: 50 MB <br>  Website: <a href="http://gajim.org/">gajim.org</a> <br><br>  Once upon a time, I launched this program for the first time.  That day I rubbed my hands and thought ‚Äúfinally I found a simple jabber-client for friends, to whom everything is just unpretentious and without extra buttons serve!‚Äù.  For some time, to help friends, I sat on Gajim'e ... what was my surprise when I realized that I was just sitting on it!  Gajim surprisingly found the middle spot between beauty, functionality and simplicity. <br>  Beauty: Hajim is not decorated without the possibility of using skins.  However, the interface is so polished that it is not needed. <br>  Functionality: in spite of its seeming simplicity, the client performs his duties <i>perfectly</i> .  The client fully supports Jabber with all its documented features.  Many things are thought out for pleasant communication. <br>  Simplicity: all necessary settings are where they should be.  The number of settings (visible) is quite modest, which does not confuse the client, but there is a special button with the advanced settings tree, where you can properly configure the client once, and forget about them forever :) <br>  Of the minuses, it is worth noting occasional errors (but not dropping the client, but simply showing that the error has occurred) and freezing when it is impossible to connect to the server. <br><br>  <b>For whom</b> : <br><ul><li>  If you use mostly jabber, then perhaps it‚Äôs better not to find a client </li><li>  If you are going to switch to jabber, you can use Gajim with connected transport.  This is how I did for a long time </li></ul><br><br><br><br><br><h4>  Psi </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2b8/cbb/7a5/2b8cbb7a5828bb4a502127e084035519.png" alt="image"><br>  Version: 0.13 (07.27.09) <br>  Protocols: Jabber <br>  OS: Windows, Linux, Mac OS <br>  Occupies memory: 30 mb <br>  Website: <a href="http://psi-im.org/">psi-im.org</a> <br><br>  Looks like a simple Jabber client.  The regular version does not support activity, the enhanced versions (Psi +) partially support them.  Moods are supported, but rather trivially - just with text, without an icon.  Music tune is also present. <br>  As in Gajim, many settings are hidden from the user in a special settings tree, which allows you to quickly change frequently used settings, while leaving the ability to ‚Äúfine tune‚Äù the client sometimes. In general, the client is not inferior to Gajim‚Äôs functionality. the view is already an amateur. <br><br>  <b>For whom</b> : <br><ul><li>  If you just need jabber and arranges the interface. </li><li>  <s>Maybe for Mak'ovtsev?</s> </li></ul><br><br><br><br><br><h4>  Yandex.ICQ </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/eab/88f/2d1/eab88f2d1652eba1628e31bb39bb9d4f.png" alt="image"><br>  Version: 6.5 <br>  Protocols: ICQ <br>  OS: Windows <br>  Size: 15.8 MB + required updates <br>  Holds in memory: 77 MB <br>  Website: <a href="http://icq.yandex.ru/">icq.yandex.ru</a> <br><br>  The answer to Yandex Rambler is ‚ÄúICQ with Yandex taste‚Äù.  When I saw the installation wizard start up and the hard drive rustling helplessly, I realized that I was putting an official ICQ.  Seeing a nice plastic interface installer that any 5th grader could make, I clicked ‚Äúnext‚Äù and, recalling the situation with QIP, clicked on ‚ÄúCustom installation‚Äù.  So it is, there were instantly <b>hidden</b> points where I was not asked to choose which ICQ components I want to install, but 3 ticks were suggested with all sorts of "make yandex a homepage" and other "advertisements".  Removing all the checkmarks, I started the installation.  It lasted for quite a long time, without asking me, climbing something to download from the Internet, and so on, as befits an official client.  At the end of the installation, I immediately ticked ‚ÄúStart ICQ‚Äù, after which I was again waiting for downloading updates for an already installed client (for those who do not know, the official client will not work without updates, so one day you can just stay without ICQ).  Further, the same plastic-white-gray interface appeared in front of me.  Having logged into ICQ with the taste of Yandex, I made sure that this client does not contain any changes compared to a regular ICQ.  I was greeted on the whole screen by an open pseudo-browser window, where we should see supposedly news, and supposedly have fun ... <br>  I tried to send SMS, which there are 20 pieces "for free".  It has not reached the addressee.  Constantly the field below is closed with a white square "Chivelam" - apparently there should be advertising.  This square itself occupies half the list, which, by the way, is not subject to special resizing.  Looking at the contact list is painful, this is the same as reading a book at a distance of 5 meters - too few contacts fit because of the huge ‚Äúcap‚Äù and useless flash insert at the bottom. <br>  But in this client there are completely useless "chips": games (by the way my favorite "War of Mutts" - I recommend), tZer (extremely stupid flash-mults sent to the interlocutor), Zlango (above the text shows pictures explaining the text), and also video audio calls (it is not clear how, did not try), flash chat and other nonsense.  It has long been clear that ICQ does not even think about improving the protocol.  What for?  It is more difficult, it requires the presence of brains, and other customers can jump.  Instead, a lot of flash content is put on, which does nothing but breaks traffic, shows ads and slows down the whole computer. <br>  You can also forget about several running numbers: the program does not allow itself to be run 2 times and the ability to use several numbers at the same time is also not provided. <br>  The only thing that pins me in this client is pop-up messages, I have not seen anywhere that they are so cool to pop up "from the puddle."  :) <br><br>  <b>For whom</b> : <br><ul><li>  For those who have fast and endless Internet, a large enough monitor and not a weak computer </li><li>  For those who need not so much communication, as eternal entertainment like flash games with friends, listening to the radio, throwing cartoons ... </li><li>  For those who like a plastic interface with a beautiful smooth transfusion and messages "from the puddle." </li></ul><br><br><br><br><br><h4>  Rambler.ICQ </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7b5/84b/ef4/7b584bef42821a5db915d19cef6b29cf.png" alt="image"><br>  Version: 6.5 <br>  Protocols: ICQ <br>  OS: Windows <br>  Size: 15.8 MB + required updates <br>  Holds in memory: 68 MB <br>  Website: <a href="http://icq.rambler.ru/">icq.rambler.ru</a> <br><br>  All of them, official customers, are the same.  And yet, there is some difference. <br>  The installer at the Rambler was more thoughtful, there is more animation giving you a distraction from the long installation.  By the way, the situation with QIP and Yandex.ICQ is not repeated here.  This is me talking about the fact that when you put Rambler.ICQ, the checkboxes with the subscription to the rambler services are not hidden under the ‚Äúadvanced installation‚Äù, they are clearly visible. <br>  From Rambler.ICQ I got a message to the addressee.  True, it turned out that 20 free SMS are tied to a number (or computer?), So I already have 18 of them left :) <br>  Otherwise, they are completely identical. <br>  <b>For whom</b> : <br><ul><li>  For those who have fast and endless Internet, a large enough monitor and not a weak computer </li><li>  For those who need not so much communication, as eternal entertainment like flash games with friends, listening to the radio, throwing cartoons ... </li><li>  For those who like a plastic interface with a beautiful smooth transfusion and messages "from the puddle." </li></ul><br><br><br><br><br><h4>  ICQ </h4><br>  - // - Website: <a href="http://icq.com/">icq.com</a> <br><br>  Rambler.ICQ with a green interface. <br>  - // - <br><br><br><h4>  ICQ Lite </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/16a/892/6ca/16a8926cad9db8aca4d5809fae7eb21d.png" alt="image"><br>  Version: 1.0 <br>  OS: Windows <br>  Size: 9.2 MB + required updates <br>  Website: <a href="http://icq.com/">icq.com</a> <br><br>  They took ICQ, cut out the entire flash from it, made the interface a gray gradient in the style of Macintosh (I remember the good old QuickTime), decided that the eggplant color would be the best for us and this miracle was laid out to us. <br><br>  <b>For whom</b> : <br><ul><li>  For those who do not like the abundance of flash, but need an official client. </li></ul><br><br><br><br><br><h4>  R &amp; Q </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d49/06a/f73/d4906af73c124db65d3c1d79f2e6327c.png" alt="image"><br>  Version: 1105 (08/10/08) <br>  Protocols: ICQ, Mail.ru <br>  OC: Windows <br>  Size: 1.2 MB <br>  It occupies memory: 22 MB <br>  Website: <a href="http://rnq.ru/">rnq.ru</a> <br><br>  Having put in 1.2 MB turned out quite a functional client.  ICQ functionality is all there is.  For some reason I did not find multi-accounts, it is probably assumed that you need to run several copies of the client.  At the same time, R &amp; Q has a certain skininess, on the official website for it there are different skins, plug-ins, emoticon sets, and more.  However, those who say that the interface is rather poor will be right.  Something in the interface is wrong, it looks a bit rustic. <br><br>  <b>For whom</b> : <br><ul><li>  Who needs external simplicity, but not bad functionality (in other words, those whom QIP 2005 does not like with the lack of settings and plug-ins) </li><li>  For those who need ICQ and Mail.ru in one bottle, it also requires simplicity in the client </li><li>  Who needs the easiest interface, portability and just working ICQ / mail.ru </li></ul><br><br><br><h6>  Naturally, the most interesting thing I left at the end ... </h6><br><br><br><h4>  QIP 2005 </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ce1/74f/133/ce174f1332703d696a31ab8d597bac23.png" alt="image"><br>  Version: (beta?) Build 8094 (07/27/09) <br>  Protocols: ICQ <br>  OS: Windows <br>  Size: 2 MB <br>  It occupies memory: 23 MB <br>  Website: <a href="http://qip.ru/ru/pages/download_qip_ru/">qip.ru</a> <br><br>  So, everyone's beloved QIP, from which we are declaring criminals out of the license agreement (because for some reason we use the ICQ protocol which is implemented as if in a qvip, as it were, between the cases ...) :) <br>  The choice is to download different QIP installation options: either the installer, or the installer packaged in the ZIP, or the installer packaged in the RAR :) Known joke, but unfortunately, a necessary measure to offer us your convenient services (you could download it before version without installer).  Despite this, QIP remains a portable program, that is, you can install it in a separate folder, pack it, and uninstall the installer - QIP is not tied to a computer. <br>  Let's go further.  Remembering the recent <a href="http://enikei.habrahabr.ru/blog/65550/">perturbations</a> about the installer, I remember that I am an experienced user, and I click on ‚ÄúCustom installation (for advanced users)‚Äù, and in general I understand what caused righteous anger, even Yandex.ICQ in this case gives points where you can remove all the checkmarks, while QIP naturally waits for pressing the ‚ÄúNext‚Äù button, an ‚Äúexperienced user‚Äù can chill, and choose the so-called ‚ÄúComplete installation‚Äù.  This is all niggling of course, just remember that the situation was interested and chew it.  By the way, at the end I was offered to try IE8 :) I boldly refuse and launch QIP. <br>  Our pet is loaded, of course, noticeably slower than ever before ... Despite this, the client is not overgrown with advertising, buttons and other things than terrifying or intimidating.  Just QIP. <br>  There is no multi-account, the skin capacity is minimal, there are even fewer settings. <br>  They will only be annoyed with notifications that I have to update, and they get out, regardless of the settings, and not in a quiet pop-up, but as a separate interfering window. <br>  An interesting feature: few people know that QIP 2005 has not left the testing stage.  The author himself spoke of this when he released QIP Infium.  Unfortunately, all the references to QIP have miraculously disappeared from Ilham‚Äôs blog, and relevant topics are rubbed on the forum.  I will be glad if someone finds a mention of it :) <br>  I also recall that the development of QIP 2005 has long been discontinued, but its support continues, that is, the correction of critical vulnerabilities and the release of critical updates. <br><br>  <b>For whom</b> : <br><ul><li>  Who needs a client with minimal functionality </li><li>  "If only it worked."

Removing the checkboxes, move on.  Installation, as usual, instant (in fact, unpacking), I do not need QIP.Online. <br>  When I start, I am offered to store the profile in Application Data and this is correct.  If you need portability, choose the second item, but if you have a home computer, it is better to store the settings in the folder where the settings are stored (an explanation of this principle is not included in this article, I recommend reading how the file system in Linux is organized). <br>  So, I offer to register on their service.  I refuse and try to enter the profile from the bald.  Naturally it does not work and you need a profile on their website (it will not start without it).  It‚Äôs good that I have had my account a long time ago, I enter it, I see in front of it a window for filling in the addition of protocols, and suddenly I notice something familiar ... <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d4d/edb/506/d4dedb50618d291955190d4804bbfb03.png" alt="image"><br>  Oh yes!

Download on <a href="http:">www.qip.ru</a> ‚Äù, but did not find the activities and moods of the jabber ... apparently they are not needed. <br>  The windows open with an effort, apparently affects the work base (in the first versions, it was terrible). <br>  In isolated mode, QIP no longer obliges to use an account on the site.  However, it didn‚Äôt save me from the standard settings, advertising still got out.  Okay, the user is obliged to remove it himself, do not worry. <br>  The ability to change skins questioned.  That is, no, of course the interface is changing!  There are skins, a great many.  But they cannot drastically change the interface.  The only project that assumed full-fledged opportunities for changing the interface, as I understood, was bent ... or froze.  At the moment, skin capacity is simply a change of colors of different elements and the imposition of various background images. <br>  It should be noted that QIP Infium is still a multi-protocol, multi-account, portable program.  It has all the necessary popular protocols (Jabber let us down, it's not interesting to live without activities and moods), there is a fairly wide range of plug-ins. <br><br>  <b>For whom</b> : <br><ul><li>  For those who are not afraid of being hung up with a bunch of services (and who even like it, because such programs are designed to be used by services, then it is really convenient to work in it) </li><li>  For those who trust RBC, and is not afraid that his mail, accounts and passwords may get to someone who knows </li><li>  For those who can disable everything, including mailing and spamming in ICQ (and this is just a rumor) </li><li>  For fans of qvip as a program (and not ‚Äúclassic‚Äù qvip) </li><li>  For those who for some reason have not mastered Miranda and qutIM, but want to have plugins </li></ul><br><br><br><br><br><h4>  qutIM </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/22b/e10/fcf/22be10fcfe7858a1ab9f05c56140e73f.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Version: 0.2 Beta 2 <br>  Protocols: <b>ICQ</b> , <b>Jabber</b> , Mail.Ru, IRC, Vkontakte <br>  OS: Linux, MacOS, Windows <br>  Size: 9.3 MB <br>  It occupies memory: 33 MB <br>  Website: <a href="http://www.qutim.org/glavnaya">qutim.org</a> <br><br>  Quite an unusual and interesting client (according to statistics, it is from these words that the description of Kutima most often begins).

The default is exactly the installer. I will trust the ‚Äúdefault‚Äù, I open the installer, very smart (the size is quite small). It offers to choose protocols, whether to install the import plugin and where to store the profile, in Application Data or in the program root. Since I'm not going to take Miranda away from the company, I choose (or rather, it has already been selected) in App Data. Installation flew. The profile manager opens. Create a profile. Now I offer to create accounts. After creating the necessary accounts, make sure that the ‚Äúnaked‚Äù Miranda is an amazing combination of minimalism and power.</font></font><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/015/b90/773/015b90773b76f6ba7d47e8ccdd794415.png" alt="image"><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Externally, the interface is extremely unremarkable and looks completely deserted. But in fact, already in this position, Miranda can be completely transformed to any of your requirements due to the huge number of settings. The number of settings affects and confuses the novice. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">However, let me show you a snapshot taken after I installed two plugins that are recommended for installation right there on the download page. </font></font><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7bc/556/06f/7bc55606f86314b999daa9caa65585d9.jpg" alt="image"><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">As you can see, Modern Contact List and TabSRMM (a total of ~ 500 kb) quite significantly transformed Miranda. Naturally, no Aero on XP can be, you see in front of yourself how much the skins engine is thought out (this is the same plugin I just installed).</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">As you can see, the core of Miranda is very powerful, stable and, most importantly, you can put a bunch of add-ons on it and change it beyond recognition. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But about this below, in this ‚Äúsubsection‚Äù I wanted to tell about the standard, absolutely ‚Äúnaked‚Äù Miranda. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">As you can see, I didn‚Äôt even put Russian on her :) </font></font><br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For whom </font></font><u><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúMiranda from scratch‚Äù is</font></font></u></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> suitable</font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> :</font></font><br><ul><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Obviously, for those who want utter minimalism combined with great power </font></font></li><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For those who want to create their favorite client from scratch. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Believe me, if you choose for yourself all the necessary modules, skins, icons, etc., then the ideal client will come out for you</font></font></li><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For those who want to use Miranda purposefully somewhere. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For example, you can make the assembly, taking into account the features of the company or specifically for the local network.</font></font></li></ul><br><br><br><h6><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Miranda builds and other features </font></font></h6><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">An assembly is a specific set of plug-ins, skins, icons, and preset Miranda settings that collectors create (ordinary people. Even those who just use Miranda, to some extent collectors, as they change settings for themselves, install their favorite plugins) and post for public use. There are a lot of assemblies on the Internet, they are all different, they are very heavy, bulky and versatile like a Swiss knife, they are very light, there are portable ones, there are assemblies with an emphasis on the beauty of the interface ... The imagination of collectors is infinite, various variations are mass. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The purpose of my article is not to talk about the endless possibilities of Miranda, but to give a general idea. So without further ado, believe me that Miranda is </font></font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">power</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This is an absolute customization. Miranda can be collected from an absolutely ‚Äúnaked‚Äù client, ending with an incredible ‚Äúmonster‚Äù who has EVERYTHING in his arsenal (all that is missing is the coffee.dll plugin that would make coffee and money.dll ... well, you know what I mean). </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Miranda haters of Miranda like to use the ‚Äúreverse effect‚Äù (I don‚Äôt understand such people at all). They claim that there are too many settings. Too much. And indeed, I saw only a couple of assemblies that would somehow hide the settings from the user, all other assemblies leave the user the right to choose ... and only then I see the problem :)</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Ladies and gentlemen, I am ready to explain why (in my opinion) the newcomer has problems with Miranda. Here the user finds the assembly, downloads. Everything is good, everything is convenient, everywhere everything is beautiful and pleasant to talk ... Suddenly, he sees the settings button. Curiosity of course takes the upper hand, he goes to the settings. And then suddenly it comes to his head that this badge should be removed at all, but this tick is superfluous here, I don‚Äôt like this notification ... The newbie starts scouring the settings. No one was killed for setting up a client for themselves, but a newbie sees that there are many of them, and many of them do not understand what they are doing. Chaotic, like a hurricane, a novice is traversed by all the checkmarks by randomly exposing values. After pressing the "OK" button, he safely forgets that he was wrong there, sees that his actions "strangely enough" affected Miranda and removed her in "righteous rage."Such a novice is easier to use QIP, where there is simply no freedom of choice.</font></font> :) <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In other words, I urge users to very carefully select assemblies for themselves (this is essentially a choice of an IM client ‚Äî each assembly is not so similar that they can be considered completely different). Once you have chosen the assembly, do not instantly try to do something ‚Äúlike in qvip‚Äù or ‚Äúlike in ICQ‚Äù. If you bear a little bit, it turns out that ‚Äúlike in Miranda‚Äù is more convenient :) And yes, of course, you may not be lucky right away and the assembly will not like it. But you have the freedom of choice! Choose any other, their sea! Miranda even has its own communities, for example: </font></font><a href="http://miranda-planet.com/"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Miranda-Planet</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> and </font></font><a href="http://miranda.im/"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">miranda.im</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> , where there is a lot of interesting things. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Here is an example of the assembly: </font></font><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e36/f3f/860/e36f3f8607acf31af0218e01acc7ee25.png" alt="image"><br> <a href="http://miranda-planet.com/forum/index.php%3Fautocom%3Ddownloads%26showfile%3D1060"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Miranda Empoli Pack</font></font></a> <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Agree, much better :)</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In general, of course Miranda has some problems of her own. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And there is even something that I do not really like. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For example, I am not very satisfied with the type of search and the window for changing information about myself. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In addition, improperly assembled assemblies, or assemblies with too many plug-ins, can be very unstable. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But it is more likely cavils. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Basically, Miranda is the way I described it. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">:) It is a pity she is not cross-platform. </font></font><br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For whom</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> :</font></font><br><ul><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> For those who are not afraid of the choice (even in the number of assemblies you can get lost, about the settings, I generally keep quiet) </font></font></li><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> For everyone who is not too lazy to find an assembly for the soul </font></font></li><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For those who like to customize everything for themselves. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Everything.</font></font></li><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Who needs a real combine. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">You can‚Äôt name a single client where else you could see such a variety of protocols, ranging from the most common, to accessing FTP (QIP Infium tries to get closer to the same position)</font></font></li><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For those who love variety. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">You can change skins and Miranda you will never get bored</font></font></li></ul><br><br><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> - Here I am drawing a line under IM clients :) - </font></font><br><br><br><h4>  Total: </h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I hope in the end you have chosen a suitable client :) Or you just found out that there are existing ones. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Or decided that there is no sense holivaram, all customers are good, and someone needs;)</font></font><br><br><br><br><h5><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> "Why" or "Questions from the reader" </font></font></h5><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Reader</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> : Hey!
