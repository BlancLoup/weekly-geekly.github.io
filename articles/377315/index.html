From the point of view of the Office, Haynes cannot post videos from his copter on YouTube.  The management logic is simple: YouTube videos can be monetized by allowing ads to be placed there.  If so, then flying copter is a commercial enterprise.  Consequently, these flights are subject to strict regulation by the agency. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The letter indicated that the agency had received a complaint about the use of the unmanned device for commercial purposes by Heynes, and, having checked the complaint, agreed with the charges.  Although the FAA is not responsible for regulating the flight of drones and other flying models that people launch as a hobby, the agency constantly insists on the need to distinguish between hobbies and commercial activities. <br><br>  Undoubtedly, the position of the FAA on what is considered ‚Äúcommercial use‚Äù is at least controversial.  A lawyer specializing in UAV matters, Peter Sachs, <a href="http://motherboard.vice.com/read/the-faa-says-you-cant-post-drone-videos-on-youtube%3Futm_source%3Dmbfb">said the following on this issue</a> : ‚ÄúWith this letter, the FAA states that a work of art obtained as a hobby with the help of a drone becomes a‚Äú commercial ‚Äùbackdating if it is suddenly decided to sell, or put on the site that provides monetization of content.  The sale of works of art is the inalienable right of everyone, and the state cannot prevent this. ‚Äù <br><br>  Haynes argues that although YouTube videos can be monetized in principle, he has never received advertising fees from Google.  These flights and videos are just a hobby.  And this is the first time that the FAA has made a complaint to a person because of his hobby.  The previous issues related to the copters concerned only the business and the commercial services offered by the companies.

      FAA spokesman Les Dorr explained that competitors usually send such complaints.  It is not clear who in this case seemed to be a rival modest lover.  Dorr also said that perhaps the practice was caused by some practices, captured on video, that contradict the flight safety requirements put forward by the FAA.  At the same time, he admitted that at the moment the requirements for the flight of drones are rather complicated.  Often, the regional offices of the agency solve issues without consulting the head office, with the result that their decisions sometimes contradict <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0_%25D0%25BA_%25D0%259A%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D1%2583%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B8_%25D0%25A1%25D0%25A8%25D0%2590">constitutional norms</a> . <br><br>  Since this incident was publicized, the FAA responded to it and promised to find out more about who and why this letter was sent. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/uruh29wPFPM%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700043,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhj9Zld1PzYq2raYwyIbFbs4I-QHrQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <i>One of the videos of the "offender"</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/377315/">https://habr.com/ru/post/377315/</a></p>
