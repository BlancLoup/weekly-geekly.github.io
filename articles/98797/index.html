  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Eventr.com is available in beta testing.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Eureka!  Information!  - Seryozha exclaimed and made a great Google with a friend. <br>  Eureka!  Communication!  - exclaimed Mark, made Facebook and ... became a new symbol of the ‚ÄúAmerican Dream‚Äù. <br>  Eureka!  Facebook!  - exclaimed Pasha and made Vkontakte. <br>  Eureka!  Information, communication and time saving!  - Jack exclaimed and made Twitter. <br>  And so now every year thousands of various projects appear on the Web.  More and more‚Ä¶ <br><br>  So many web services, but there is not one that we, as users, would really like!  - once we thought with <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/octave/" class="user_link">octave</a> and asked ourselves: ‚ÄúWhat do we want from the Internet?  What are we missing? ‚Äù <br>  <b>"We want in one place to receive information from different sources of the Internet, share and share it with others."</b>  <b>Just like that.</b>  <b>Surprisingly, we did not find a ready solution.</b> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The closest, perhaps, was Google Reader, but for us it was far from desired. <br>  So we decided to make a service that we ourselves would like to use.  Here we do ... <br><br><h4>  <b>I. About the project</b> </h4><br>  <b>1. Read RSS feeds in an environment where there are people.</b> <br>  We are not new to various RSS readers, including Google Reader, but we always wanted more ‚Äúlife‚Äù in them.  Along with reading RSS feeds, we lacked people with similar interests, from whom you can learn something new, share interesting things that would understand us.  Not enough simple and convenient communication. <br>  <a href="http://eventr.com/">Eventr</a> today is a social RSS reader where communication is always available and easy.  You can ‚Äúread‚Äù a person just like ‚Äúfollow‚Äù on Twitter.  Each user has his own stream - a blog where you can save (post) interesting entries from RSS feeds and write yourself. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      <b>2. Without interrupting reading, to share interesting with others.</b> <br>  In Eventr, you can create your own streams on various topics, such as ‚ÄúUseful‚Äù, ‚ÄúTechnologies‚Äù, ‚ÄúPhotos‚Äù and look through RSS feeds, save interesting entries in them.  That is, in fact, you can create your own collections and share with others without having to write them yourself, just by saving.  The stream has a personal address, which is set by the user (http://eventr.com/username) and, as a blog, any Internet user can read it.  Streams can be both open and private - closed to all. <br>  Personally, by the way, it‚Äôs convenient for me to save and group in categories useful entries from RSS feeds into categories.  Then they are easy to find and read. <br><br>  <b>3. Write, post photos, music and videos.</b> <br>  In the Eventr, you can post recordings, photos, music and video.  It is easy and convenient.  But the fundamental difference from the many existing blog platforms is that Eventr is an environment where the user on the one hand ‚Äúreceives‚Äù information from different sources on the Internet, and on the other, can immediately share it and create his own. <br>  Blog features are planning to run during the week. <br><br><h4>  <b>Ii.</b>  <b>Differences Eventr from ...</b> </h4><br>  <b>1. Google Reader:</b> <br>  1) Eventr is not just a reader, but an info-social service where you can receive, share information and communicate with others.  The user is ‚Äúnot alone‚Äù with their RSS feeds, but among people with common interests. <br>  2) In parallel with reading RSS feeds, you can also have your own blog in the Eventr, which is open to all Internet users. <br>  3) You can save records (and share with others) not only in the ‚ÄúShared Items‚Äù and ‚ÄúStarred‚Äù streams, but also in any stream that the user creates himself. <br>  <b>2. Google Buzz:</b> <br>  1) It is possible to categorize information when saving and publishing using their own streams. <br>  2) You can keep your blog open to all Internet users. <br>  3) I don‚Äôt know if I should write about the design of Buzz and GR, but as a person, it seems to me that their design is made for robots, because I‚Äôm a person who feel like a robot in such interfaces.  IMHO. <br><br><h4>  <b>Iii.</b>  <b>Generally‚Ä¶</b> </h4><br>  During the summer, the Eventr will run in beta.  This means that there will not be a number of functional at once, but it will appear gradually.  We do the project together, so we must be confident in the reliability of the system as a whole.  Please treat with understanding. <br>  Now we are actively continuing to develop.  Every week there will be updates.  First and foremost expected: a blog and comments. <br><br>  Also, soon there will be two things that we ourselves are greatly lacking right now: an auto filter (displaying only those entries from rss channels that contain user-defined keywords) and searching for entries by channels and folders. <br>  Here, perhaps, that's all. <br><br>  What is your personal opinion?  What else would you like in this service? <br><br>  Thank. <br><br>  PS Multiple interface options (standard and personal): <br><br> <a href="http://i.imagehost.org/view/0546/Basic_My_Write"><img src="http://i.imagehost.org/t/0546/Basic_My_Write.jpg" width="146" height="150" alt="Basic_My_Write.jpg (453 KB)"></a> <a href="http://i.imagehost.org/view/0052/Basic_logedOut"><img src="http://i.imagehost.org/t/0052/Basic_logedOut.jpg" width="146" height="150" alt="Basic_logedOut.jpg (402 KB)"></a> <a href="http://h.imagehost.org/view/0237/Basic_My_Broun"><img src="http://h.imagehost.org/t/0237/Basic_My_Broun.jpg" width="145" height="150" alt="Basic_My_Broun.jpg (535 KB)"></a> <br><br> <a href="http://h.imagehost.org/view/0678/Basic_My_DBlue"><img src="http://h.imagehost.org/t/0678/Basic_My_DBlue.jpg" width="140" height="150" alt="Basic_My_DBlue.jpg (521 KB)"></a> <a href="http://h.imagehost.org/view/0638/Basic_Rose"><img src="http://h.imagehost.org/t/0638/Basic_Rose.jpg" width="146" height="150" alt="Basic_Rose.jpg (517 KB)"></a> <a href="http://h.imagehost.org/view/0414/Basic_My_Blue2"><img src="http://h.imagehost.org/t/0414/Basic_My_Blue2.jpg" width="146" height="150" alt="Basic_My_Blue2.jpg (711 KB)"></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/98797/">https://habr.com/ru/post/98797/</a></p>
