Maybe a project is hanging over you that needs to be sent yesterday?  Or a lab at a university that you have to take this morning?  Or an exam, an interview, and maybe a family, or just a good book? <br><br>  But you are here.  Or somewhere else, but not where they should be.

Next, a little advertising this application.  It is free, I don‚Äôt know the developers, but perhaps it will help someone solve a problem so popular today - sitting ALL of their time in front of the screen. <br><br>  The application is called StayFocusd.  I do not know if I have the right to give a direct link to it, but if anything, Google issues it first, even if you just look for ‚Äústay focused‚Äù. <br>  It meets you with the phrase: ‚ÄúStayFocusd increases your work efficiency by limiting the time that you can waste on websites.‚Äù <br><br>  Under the spoiler, you will find a translation of the rest of the advertising text into Russian, since as far as I understand it, the company that made it did not prepare the translation.  (although with the translation they have something strange - the whole interface is partially in Russian, partly in English, but this may be the specificity of my browser) <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Transfer</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  <i>You sit at your computer and swear that you will be productive.</i>  <i>But suddenly, unexpectedly for yourself, you understand that it has already passed twelve hours!</i>  <i>During this time, you checked your mail, set a new status on Facebook, watched hot tweets, read an RSS feed, as well as about your favorite group on Wikipedia, vanished yourself vainly, spied on your ex, looked at photos of all of the culprits of your school loves, they poured plants on their Farm and lost a weekly salary playing online poker.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>The only thing you haven't done in those twelve hours is work.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>StayFocusd is an activity enhancement application that allows you to concentrate on your work by limiting the time you can spend on the sites provided for killing your time.</i>  <i>As soon as you have exhausted the time that you have taken to your nonsense classes, the sites that you have restricted your access to will become unavailable until the end of the day.</i> </div></div><br><br>  Now, a little about the application for those who are not sure if they need all these dances, but I don‚Äôt want to play any nasty things in my native browser. <br><br>  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe application is simple: <br>  After installation, an application icon appears in the upper right part of Chrome, on clicking on which you will see this pop-up window: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3aa/236/935/3aa236935aa157c56109d061d2c69864.png"><br>  In the ‚Äúremaining time‚Äù field, I currently have ‚Äúnot active‚Äù, as I limit myself only during working hours, which ends at 6 pm.  In the morning, instead, I would see how much time I have left for today. <br>  Also at the bottom of the screen, customizable windows pop up that remind you how much time you have left.  You can choose the rest of the time, which causes the appearance of the window. <br><br>  You can set up quite a lot.  The most important thing is: <ul><li>  the amount of time you spend on entertainment; </li><li>  active days (if you do not want to limit your laziness on weekends or, for example, on Tuesday); </li><li>  active time (if you practice a religion that allows you to be distracted at night); </li><li>  special option called <i>‚ÄúNuke em!‚Äù</i> , which prohibits ALL for the period of time you set. </li></ul><br><br>  It is worth noting that active days, as well as active hours, are set <b>only</b> the <b>next</b> day.  That is, you can not suddenly make yourself a break for today. <br><br>  However, you can change the amount of time allotted.  The truth will have to go through a rather long list of consecutive pop-ups, which to no avail are trying to get through to your conscience and responsibility: <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Call to conscience</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f38/1ca/9b2/f381ca9b2ffd285410ce309c93636cbc.png"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ab8/26b/433/ab826b4338da957aefe284c493cb81bd.png"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f45/bf6/ce2/f45bf6ce2a7618be9c58f0e9e605d575.png"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9f1/82d/6f3/9f182d6f30f14bb91ac34139fda7f965.png"></div></div><br>  You can also load yourself additionally with a special task that will make time extension tedious and inefficient.  For example, the introduction of the text.  The default text is: <br>  <i>The amateur of time usually does not doubt that he will have time to finish the work on time (and then why rush to start it?), And assures that he has everything under control.</i>  <i>Time flies by.</i>  <i>As a result, at some point it becomes clear that the work should have been started a long time ago, and it should be taken soon.</i> <br>  But it can be changed to arbitrary.  The bottom line is that in order to change any settings, you will have to enter text.  And no, the copy will not work, since the number of characters must correspond to the number of keystrokes in order to type them. <br><br>  And one more thing - the program continues to count down the seconds, if you follow the link from the "forbidden" site and continue to lose your time there.  This is quite useful on the example of social networks. <br><br>  And finally, then, for the sake of what actually all this was started.  After the expiration of the set time, all banned pages are automatically updated and redirected <a href="http://www.stayfocusd.com/">here</a> , where you see such an inscription on the whole screen: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1f8/442/be9/1f8442be95b6832bd969300f374dbe3b.png"><br><br>  And a few words about the effect that it gives.  If you set yourself, for example, one hour on all sites that kill a lot of time, then sooner or later you find yourself in a situation where exactly the four sites on which you spend all the time are no longer available.  And then you sit like a fool in front of the screen and think: ‚ÄúDamn it, but what to do?‚Äù <br><br>  And here <i>there</i> are thoughts about everything that I have long wanted to do, but somehow lazy. <br><br>  Ps.  I understand that someone may argue that this is not a Habra format, but I decided to take the risk, because I was surprised by the effect this application had on me. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/152419/">https://habr.com/ru/post/152419/</a></p>
