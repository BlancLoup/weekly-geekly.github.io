      Repeat after me: "My willpower is limited." <br><br>  Colombian psychologist Heidi Grant Halvorson argues that our willpower is often not enough to cope with temptation.  Instead, she suggests using the ‚Äúif, then‚Äù rule when planning in order not to rely too much on her own willpower. <br><br>  Instead of making a decision when a certain point in time arrives, planning ‚Äúif, then‚Äù allows you to work out a defense plan in advance so that when the time comes, we already have the right decision. <br><br>  But, unfortunately, we cannot always plan ahead for future events;  in such cases, you really need to apply willpower. <br><br>  Physiologist Roy F. Baumeister and author of scientific publications John Tierney, who wrote a book about willpower, believe that it is like muscle.  Willpower can be strengthened with proper nutrition and exercise, but it is also subject to fatigue. <br><br>  Here are some simple tips on how to strengthen psychological stability and strength of mind: <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">1. In the morning, first of all perform the most difficult cases.</font> </h2><br>  Productivity experts believe that one of the most effective ways to cope with an unpleasant or difficult task is to do it in the morning.  (We recommend reading a useful article about <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/dzen-rannikh-probuzhdeniy-10-sposobov-zakrepleniya-utrennego-rituala/">10 ways of fixing the morning ritual.</a> ) <br><br>  As the energy supply of decision making is limited, our will power is weakened throughout the day.  By doing the most difficult task in the morning, you reduce the likelihood of failure when doing it later. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">2. Snack</font> </h2><br>  This may seem illogical to people who want to lose weight using willpower, but a small meal, including some sugar, will give your brain the energy needed to maintain willpower. <br><br>  Baumeister and other researchers at the University of Florida found that when participants performed testing activities that required composure, their blood glucose levels dropped significantly, which impaired performance in performing subsequent tasks that required willpower.  But when participants took a drink with glucose, their willpower did not decrease. <br>  Although some researchers used sweet treats, such as lemonade, to test this theory, food containing protein and complex carbohydrates will have a longer-term effect on intellectual abilities. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">3. Talk to yourself</font> </h2><br>  Scientists from the University of California argue that empathy for oneself supports motivation for self-improvement.  And their colleagues at the University of Illinois found that the way we talk to ourselves is also important. <br><br>  According to their research, talking to yourself in the second person (when self-affirmations begin with ‚Äúyou‚Äù) reinforces the real productivity of our actions and our intentions to act better than talking to you from the first person (when sentences begin with ‚ÄúI‚Äù). <br><br>  So the next time you need someone to encourage you to perform a difficult task, do not be afraid to say to yourself: ‚ÄúYou can do it.‚Äù <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">4. Calm down</font> </h2><br>  To tell someone to calm down is probably the most ineffective way to really calm a person.  But if you want to give a chance to your strength of will to fight, you need to do it. <br><br>  When we experience stress, our body goes into a "fight or flight" mode.  At this time we are biologically predisposed to act more instinctively and less logically, that is, our will power and the energy of decision making recede into the background. <br><br>  One of the best ways to reduce stress and increase concentration is meditation.  It is proved that it is extremely favorable both for our body and for the brain.  Due to its effectiveness, even Wall Street traders use meditation. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">5. More sleep</font> </h2><br>  Numerous scientists and security experts compare driving in a sleepy state with driving while intoxicated.  According to the Traffic Safety Foundation, every sixth fatal accident is guilty of a sleeping driver.  This is due to the fact that a moderate level of lack of sleep leads to a violation of the cognitive and motor activity of the body, equivalent to the presence of an officially acceptable level of alcohol in the blood. <br><br>  If you have not slept for 28 consecutive hours and cannot drive a car, believe that you cannot <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/5-glavnykh-oshibok-ili-pochemu-vashi-ratsionalnye-resheniya-ne-rabotayut/">make the right decisions</a> either.  When not getting enough, the prefrontal cortex loses control over those parts of the brain that are responsible for desire and reaction to stress. <br><br>  A little sleep is the best way to restore the brain and strengthen your willpower. <br><br>  PS We recommend another article on the topic - <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/kak-perestat-otvlekatsya-na-rabochem-meste-6-effektivnykh-sposobov/">How to stop distractions in the workplace: 6 effective ways.</a> <br><br>  Translated by Vyacheslav Davidenko, founder of <a href="http://www.mbaconsult.ru/">MBA Consult</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/286526/">https://habr.com/ru/post/286526/</a></p>
