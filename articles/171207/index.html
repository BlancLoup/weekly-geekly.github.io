  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Main rules of the project manager</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I want to share my experience and observations, which should be <s>adopted and the</s> project-manager should not retreat to them every <s>samurai</s> .  After all, it is known that the project-manager is a key figure in any project.  He must interact with both the customer and the development team. <br><br><h6>  Improve your knowledge </h6><br>  It is impossible to know absolutely everything!  There are projects for which you just need to learn from various sources.  Spend more than one day at the literature and view more than one hour of interactivity, which would understand in the end what the Customer wants from you and how to convey these requirements in an understandable language to the developers. <br>  <b>Remember!</b>  If you only have a general idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe work of your subordinates, they will end up with either (at best) a ‚Äúwarden‚Äù who will always rely only on their honesty, or (at worst) a ‚Äúparasite‚Äù who will be ‚Äúhung noodles on the ears "the whole team and the project will, to put it mildly, be behind schedule. <br><br><h6>  Your team </h6><br>  Find the strengths of your team, give them the job that suits them best.  Motivate your team.  Help them work together.  If the coder does not know AJAX technology, do not download it with this work.  If the designer does not know how to make videos in flash, do not set such a task before him. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h6>  Know how to plan </h6><br>  Only by planning the project, you will not be knocked out of the schedule, do not overload your team with work and hand over the project on time.

    <h6>  Learn the details of all customer requirements </h6><br>  Without details on the terms of reference, your project may be out of date.  If the Customer in the technical assignment indicates that he needs a flash-player, then find out all the details: which one, how many streams, what should he lose, and so on. <br><br><h6>  Learn from past mistakes </h6><br>  "Only the one who does nothing is not mistaken."  We are all human and we are all wrong.  Remember your mistakes, analyze them, and try not to repeat. <br><br><h6>  Radiate confidence </h6><br>  Believe that you are capable of more.  Be sure what you are doing and what you are going to do.  The confident project-manager is the one who is sure that in the remaining 2 days before the deadline he will have time to do and pass the project. <br><br><h6>  Learn to say no </h6><br>  You must be able to say "no" to the customer, if he demands the impossible, not according to the profile of your team, or who gets out of schedule and cost estimates. <br><br><h6>  Do not touch projects if you are not sure that you will complete them. </h6><br>  Delve into what the Customer wants from you and your team.  If you are not sure that you will meet the deadlines with the requirements of the Customer, do not touch the project. <br><br><h6>  Do not deliberately make useless projects. </h6><br>  Any product (website, mobile app, interactive) will be used by the final audience.  You do all the projects for her, not for the customer.  If the Customer demands to make the mobile application overloaded with functionality, with no usability, <s>hellish</s> scary icons that his 8-year-old son drew, explain to him that this application will not be used by anyone.  Thus, you will save yourself and your team from unnecessary, unclaimed long-term work and save the Client his budget. <br><br>  In conclusion, I want to say that the project-manager is a key figure in most projects.  Removing it from a project or replacing it will be disastrous and can put an end to many projects.  During the implementation of the project, his manager should constantly be engaged in specifying the work schedule, monitoring the implementation of tasks and serve as an additional ‚Äúreference tool‚Äù to the system specification, which is implemented by members of his team. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/171207/">https://habr.com/ru/post/171207/</a></p>
