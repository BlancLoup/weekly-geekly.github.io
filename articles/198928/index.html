  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to get an American diploma from higher education</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The topic of changes in the higher education system is becoming increasingly relevant.  There is much talk about online courses as an alternative to university education.  One of the main arguments for a traditional university education is the lack of a diploma and real certification after the end of the online course. <br><br>  In fact, certification can be obtained.  And not just a certificate of exam after a certain course, but a very real diploma of an American college after completing a specific program of courses. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      <i>I want to note that the information for this post was obtained from the websites of testing centers, reviews on forums and emails with the organizations listed below.</i>  <i>But I myself did not try to get an education in this way in practice, and personally I don‚Äôt know anyone who tried and did it.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>And further.</i>  <i>This method of obtaining education is more suitable for specialties where practical training is not decisive or can be conducted remotely.</i>  <i>For example, for IT, business education, marketing, economics, and so on.</i>  <i>But not suitable for education in chemistry or biology.</i>  <i>Here, without classes in the laboratory can not do.</i> <br><br><h4>  College credit for what you already know </h4><br>  If you search Google for this phrase you will find several organizations offering to pass exams in many disciplines and get a certificate.  This certificate is recognized by most American colleges and you will be credited with a loan for this subject and you don‚Äôt need to learn and pass it again at the college. <br><br>  Judging by the coverage of subjects and reviews on the Web, 2 organizations can be called the most developed - <a href="https://clep.collegeboard.org/">CLEP</a> and <a href="http://www.excelsior.edu/">Excelsior College</a> . <br>  Both companies offer to pass exams in a variety of subjects and get a loan for these subjects in almost any college in the United States. <br><br>  The most interesting.  You can pass on this system exams for subjects from a particular program and get a bachelor's degree.  This opportunity is offered at Excelsior College.  After passing all the exams, you will need to listen to one additional course online specifically from this organization (as I understand it, a special course on the chosen specialty). <br><br>  You can still pass all the exams in such independent certification centers and go to any college to receive a diploma.  But it will be more expensive.  And be sure to visit the United States.  In any case, saving time and money is substantial. <br><br><h4>  How to take exams. </h4><br>  The first impression is that the exam must be taken online and skeptics will immediately say that such a system cannot adequately assess the level of knowledge of the applicant, and that there are many ways to deceive the system.  But in fact, the system works differently.  Such organizations have many certification centers in the United States and around the world. <br><br>  For example, Excelsior College collaborates with testing centers in Russia and Ukraine.  Here you can look for <a href="https://wsr.pearsonvue.com/testtaker/registration/SelectTestCenterProximity/EXCELSIORCOLLEG/223096">certification authorities</a> .  Search according to Moscow, Russia, Kiev, Ukraine and so on. <br><br>  But there is a condition for passing exams.  You need confirmation of the appropriate level of English.  For example, IELTS certificate. <br><br><h4>  Cost of </h4><br>  This way of taking exams and getting loans is not free.  But not expensive.  At Excelsior College, an attempt to pass one exam costs from $ 95.  In CLEP from 80 dollars. <br>  To fulfill the conditions of the program you need to pass about 30 exams.  Total - the cost will be from 2500 to 5000 dollars.  But if you need to fly to the United States to complete your program, you need to add the cost of the trip.  It is quite comparable with the cost of education in a domestic university. <br><br><h4>  How to prepare for exams </h4><br>  The easiest way is self-education.  Usually, such organizations provide materials for training.  For example, CLEP sells manuals for $ 20. <br><br>  But it is possible and an alternative way.  These are open online courses which are now a great many.  Everyone heard about the courses from Coursera, edX, Saylor.org and so on. <br><br>  Go to the website MyEducationPath.com to catalog <a href="http://myeducationpath.com/courses/">online courses</a> and look for the desired course.  We already have more than 10,000 courses in the database from more than 30 providers.  You can also use the <a href="http://myeducationpath.com/courses/%3Fview%3Dcalendar%26date%3D2013-10-24%26caltype%3Dvendors">calendar of courses</a> .  Some providers launch courses at a certain time and then close.  Others give access to the course at any time. <br><br><h4>  How MyEducationPath.com simplifies this way of getting an education </h4><br>  One of the objectives of the project MyEducationPath.com is to help not to get lost in a variety of courses, exams, providers and programs. <br><br>  The goal of the project MyEducationPath.com is to systematize information from the category of ‚Äúhigher education of the future‚Äù and to determine the links between different objects and structures.  For example, find online courses from different providers that are suitable for preparing for a given exam from CLEP or Excelsior.  For most exams, such connections are already defined. <br>  Examples: <br><ul><li>  <a href="http://myeducationpath.com/exams/4/Anatomy%2B%2526%2BPhysiology.htm">Anatomy &amp; Physiology</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://myeducationpath.com/exams/6/Basic%2BGenetics.htm">Basic Genetics</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://myeducationpath.com/exams/67/Biology.htm">Biology</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://myeducationpath.com/exams/68/Calculus.htm">Calculus</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://myeducationpath.com/exams/9/Business%2BLaw.htm">Business law</a> </li></ul><br><br>  With the emergence of new courses, we add them to these lists. <br><br>  In addition, the MyEducationPath can help build a curriculum from online courses and exams.  For this, there is the <a href="http://myeducationpath.com/page/mypath.htm">My Path</a> tool - the personal education planner. <br><br>  Finally, we have built several training programs for different specialties and continue to add new ones.  Programs are not invented out of nothing, we took the program of American colleges as the basis.  Here are some of them. <br><br>  <a href="http://myeducationpath.com/paths/22/Bachelor%2Bof%2BScience%2Bin%2BBusiness%2B(with%2Bdegree%2Bassigned).htm">Bachelor of Science in Business</a> based on Excelsior exams.  With this program and all exams, you can get a real bachelor's degree from Excelsior College. <br><br>  Other programs (without exams, courses only): <br><ul><li>  <a href="http://myeducationpath.com/paths/3/Accounting.htm">Accounting</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://myeducationpath.com/paths/9/Business%2BAdministration.htm">Business Administration</a> </li></ul><br><br>  Training programs for programmers: <br><ul><li>  <a href="http://myeducationpath.com/paths/27/Java%2BDeveloper%2B(Associate).htm">Java Developer (Associate)</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://myeducationpath.com/paths/26/PHP%2BDeveloper%2B(Associates).htm">PHP Developer (Associates)</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://myeducationpath.com/paths/7/Software%2BDevelopment.htm">Software development</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://myeducationpath.com/paths/35/Software%2BDevelopment%2BDegree%2Bwith%2BCoursera%2BStarts%2BSep%2B2013.htm">Software Development Degree with Coursera Starts Sep 2013</a> </li></ul><br><br>  Each registered user can create such a training plan and publish it in open access.  For example, one of the users published the program <a href="http://myeducationpath.com/paths/29/Coursera%2BAdvance%2BDiploma%2Bin%2BEconomics%2B%2526%2BFinance%2B.htm">Coursera Advance Diploma in Economics &amp; Finance</a> <br><br><h4>  Finally </h4><br>  The purpose of this article is to show that a full-fledged higher education can now be obtained by alternative methods.  The method of obtaining a diploma of higher education of the American sample is suitable only for some specialties.  But I am sure that the situation will change very soon.  Following the boom of online learning, there will come a boom of secure online testing.  Instead of a diploma will be an <a href="http://myeducationpath.com/page/mypath.htm">education passport</a> .  And the last moment will remain - employers should begin to trust such education passports instead of a diploma.  All you need is a positive experience in hiring such employees.  If this happens, then the turning point for a traditional university will come. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/198928/">https://habr.com/ru/post/198928/</a></p>
