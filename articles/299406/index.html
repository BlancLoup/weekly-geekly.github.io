Intellect cards are not a panacea, while they are great for facilitating the structuring of information when creating a UTP.  The whole process takes an average of 30 minutes.  In the article you will see how and what to do with examples of physical goods and educational services. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  MindMap does not replace brainstorming, customer surveys, web analytics.  This is a way of thinking, finding links between 4 marketing parameters:

      - Properties - the characteristics of the product (what it does, how it works, what it consists of); <br>  - Benefits - the properties of the product are useful for buyers; <br>  - Audience - whose life the product makes better; <br>  - Situation - when the product can make the life of the buyer better. <br><br>  The result is: <br><br>  Value - exactly the characteristic feature of the product will make the life of the buyer better.  This is what you create the whole scheme for.  The essence of a unique sales offer. <br><br>  Ideally, UTP should give potential customers answers to 3 questions: <br><br>  1) Why do I need it, what need does it cover? <br>  2) Why is this product, and not other solutions? <br>  3) Why should I buy from you? <br><br>  Value can be used: <br><br>  - In the landing page header; <br>  - In the ads contextual, targeted advertising; <br>  - In the selling texts on the site, promotional materials; <br>  - In product information articles. <br><br>  Almost every product or service has several target groups and applications.  Intellect card will help to quickly establish the relationship of properties - consumer benefits and prepare proposals for each audience. <br><br>  <b>MindMap Tools</b> <br><br>  The easiest option is to draw a map by hand.  Yes, yes, take a sheet of paper with a pen and draw "how God puts it on the soul."  Let it be crooked, with a bunch of handwriting, while drawing hands free, removes the fear of doing something wrong. <br><br>  For fans of gadgets, <b><a href="http://mypaint.org/">MyPaint</a></b> is a free program that allows you to make digital images of acceptable quality.  Not Photoshop, but the bells and whistles in this case are not needed.  Mindmap will be able to draw a person with any level of proficiency in graphics.  The most convenient way to work on the tablet. <br><br>  When you need to "pack" the card beautifully, we take special services.  We used <b><a href="http://www.xmind.net/download/win/">XMind</a></b> - an easy-to-use cross-platform software (works in Windows, Linux, Mac OS). <br><br>  To begin, "we outline" an approximate scheme.  In the center - the product or service.  The first "orbit" - all the significant properties of the product, both positive and negative.  The inclusion of negative properties is important for practicing objections.  The last circle is the target groups + for what and when they use the product (fields of application and situations). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4dc/4e1/fd1/4dc4e1fd179d452e9c2ac14d62d9f00b.jpg"><br><br>  From properties we stretch connections to situations and target groups.  The element to which several arrows lead is the key to creating the UTP. <br><br>  Here is how it looks on the example of a graphic tablet - a device for drawing and editing images. <br><br>  <b>Example ‚Ññ1</b> <br><br>  In the first round - 6 characteristics of the product.  Positive lines are marked with green lines, negative lines are red. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1d5/d3c/16d/1d5d3c16d21a4ad0b4afa9f0299eca76.jpg"><br><br>  The advantages are that using a tablet you can create and process graphics without special skills and are several times faster than using a mouse on a ‚Äúbig‚Äù computer. <br>  The disadvantages are in a fairly high price (a high-quality tablet costs 23-25 ‚Äã‚Äãthousand rubles, some models up to 45 thousand rubles) and the need for a computer with a powerful ‚ÄúRAM‚Äù and a video card for storing images.  However, this is critical only for one of the target groups. <br><br>  Tablet PC vendors present them as a tool for creative people - photographers, artists, designers, architects.  At the same time, we have "looms" 2 more target groups in the second round.  We call it "People, situations, needs": <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dd5/788/a79/dd5788a7929e4aeb8cfc4afb5dbccb45.jpg"><br><br>  The second group is business people.  The key value for them is the ability to create simple outlines and presentations, ‚Äúwithout bothering,‚Äù anywhere.  Electronic signature is a secondary need. <br><br>  UTP variant for selling text - ‚ÄúWacom graphic tablet: create graphics, charts, presentations without a mouse and Photoshop‚Äù. <br><br>  The third group is parents who buy a tablet for children to develop their creative abilities.  In this case, they have two minuses: expensive and powerful computer.  Exit - buying a simpler model.  Children do not need to make ‚Äúsuperpictures‚Äù in high resolution. <br><br>  Finally, the main target group is designers, artists, photographers, architects.  Here we highlight the rapid creation and processing of images.  With minimal effort and anywhere, without losing quality. <br><br>  UTP variant - ‚ÄúWacom graphic tablet: professional editing of images on the knee‚Äù. <br><br>  This is a short version for headlines and ad text, but in general it can be expanded in more informational articles and promotional materials.  With its own nuances for architects, designers, photographers.  From this you can make a content plan for a series of publications. <br><br>  <b>Example 2</b> <br><br>  Management training technology.  Goals and objectives on the ‚ÄúWhat does the training‚Äù scheme: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5b1/a61/004/5b1a61004c004f0598db7efce5e4c3e1.jpg"><br><br>  According to the results of the training participant must work out the skills of negotiation, learn to set and control tasks, diagnose the interlocutor's psycho-type, make contact with the right people in person and by phone.  The main feature of the training is the development of the ability to negotiate and persuade interlocutors at any level, from the staff of the department to the business partners.  Hence, several needs and target groups: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a75/f66/46d/a75f6646d4cb44278e561ab83172313a.jpg"><br><br>  So, we have three types of participants: leaders with experience, leaders without experience (‚ÄúRaised‚Äù) and startups. <br><br>  Senior executives come for an increase in employee returns (sales have sunk, motivation has fallen) and increased business meetings ‚Äî convincing interlocutors, more deals.  Two equivalent values, so it is better to make an independent proposal for each, with step-by-step ‚Äúliner‚Äù.  Through a series of materials in an email newsletter, for example. <br><br>  Approximate topics: ‚ÄúHow to manage employees without rush jobs‚Äù, ‚ÄúHow to deal with employees' pofigism‚Äù, ‚ÄúHow to hold useful meetings‚Äù, etc.  In the first case. <br><br>  In the second, ‚ÄúThe Five Rules of the Negotiator,‚Äù ‚ÄúA System of Tough Negotiations, Bringing $ 100 Billion Per Year,‚Äù etc. <br><br>  For the "rosters" highlight the creation of credibility, the implementation of tasks. <br><br>  Finally, for startups, in our opinion, it is important to create an efficient team of like-minded people in the first place. <br><br>  PS In conclusion, we note that the intelligence card is not a ready-made solution to the UTP.  They help to decompose the initial information "on the shelves", to separate the important from the secondary, to determine the strategy of communicating the value - to create only a short landing page or a series of articles in the newsletter, for example. <br><br>  Share your experience, ask questions in the comments on the use of methods in your business.  Discuss, help) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/299406/">https://habr.com/ru/post/299406/</a></p>
