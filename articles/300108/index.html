  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Broadcaster for MacBook. Blog start</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello everyone, we are developing a video Broadcast for MacBook and the accompanying server part.  Our main focus is to make a convenient tool for business broadcasts and webinars from a MacBook.  In this blog, I plan to describe how the technical aspects of our project, for example, <br>  why we chose Erlang, as well as different user cases, for example, how to do a webinar with masking from MSQRD. <br><br>  In the first post I would like to reveal some basic points. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  About the idea </h4><br>  As you know, Live-format is now in trend, and for gamers there is Twitch, and for street-streamers there is Periscope.  They offer convenient solutions optimized for their types of streaming and audience.  At the same time, the sector of business broadcasts and webinars is somewhat deprived of innovations.  You want to broadcast the presentation of your project with slides and face, and even with a demonstration of your iPhone application ... Be prepared to spend more than one hour on setting up, studying, etc.  Of course, people ‚Äúin the subject line‚Äù, who know what ffmpeg or rtmp is, can do everything in an hour, but our target user is a business person with no time to analyze technical nuances and who need to spend a couple of short broadcasts in six months.  He does not even want to register.  And he used to, that his MacBook saves him time. <br>  In general, we decided to make such a Broadcast system so that a person with a MacBook could make a decent broadcast in 5 minutes from scratch with a screen / application demonstration, a face, feedback from viewers and ‚Äúpunching‚Äù on the social network.  And without registration.

    <h4>  MacBook Pro </h4><br>  Now our Broadcaster only works on the Mac platform.  Of course, viewers can watch stream on all popular platforms. <br>  Although our broadcaster is basically 80% cross-platform, due to limited resources, we decided to concentrate on one platform. <br>  Our reasoning was something like this: <br><ul><li>  Linux we love.  But, those who have Linux on the desktop can customize everything themselves, and the more protracted this process is, the more pleasure they will catch.  It disappears. </li><li>  For Windows, there is already a ‚Äúcrowd‚Äù - XSplit, vxMIX, Wirecast, OBS and somehow unable to get into it.  In addition, a large fragmentation of iron.  It disappears. </li><li>  MacBook: high-quality hardware and OSX.  Normal support for OpenGL, built-in h264 encoder, the ability to capture the screens of iOS devices.  There are not so many Broadcasters for Mac, all the more integrated with stream-backend.  MacBook is very common among our Central Asia (active / business people, including startup representatives). </li></ul><br><br><h4>  About money </h4><br>  Broadcaster itself is free, and its local use, for example to record the screen, is free.  We plan to take payment only for stream-service.  One hour broadcast on 1 thousand.  a person will cost 299 rubles, billing by the minute.  No subscription fees, etc.  Put 299 rubles and broadcast.  At the same time, there is an opportunity to make a stream on YouTube and integrate with social networks.  For example, a stream can be viewed directly in the Twitter interface or in their iOS application. <br><br><h4>  Main characteristics </h4><br><ul><li>  5 minutes to start the broadcast from scratch </li><li>  Capture the screen and windows applications, cameras </li><li>  Capture iPad and iPhone by Light-cable </li><li>  A set of prepared scenes </li><li>  Re-stream on YouTube with a couple of clicks </li><li>  Twitter integration </li><li>  Without registering </li></ul><br><br><h4>  Some pictures </h4><br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img width="420" src="https://habrastorage.org/files/29c/63c/71c/29c63c71ca2540db98284b04e84dcbfd.jpg" alt="image"></div><br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img width="420" src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c05/a78/348/c05a7834820c40b3b641b29e75f863f4.jpg" alt="image"></div><br><br><h4>  Current state </h4><br>  The project is working, it is possible to use and broadcast, the payment has not yet been screwed up, so let's call this state beta testing. <br><br>  And of course, here is a link to the <a href="http://www.macstreamplatform.ru/">MacStreamPlatform.ru</a> website, and you can immediately <br>  <a href="">download broadcaster</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/300108/">https://habr.com/ru/post/300108/</a></p>
