  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Recover dead pixels by freezing</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello. <br>  I would like to share with you one of the "original" methods of restoring the "dead" pixels. <br>  I will say right away that I am not a chemist or an electronic engineer, and I have no idea how it works. <br>  I'll tell you the prehistory: <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Sitting at work, had the imprudence to drop your HTC Sensation from a chair to the floor, and the floor is covered with linoleum.  Fell flat on the display.  Why such details?  And besides, the broken pixels are still different.  Some physically "turned off", others seemed to fall asleep.  It's my opinion.  Dk here, he fell from me more than once and from a greater height, but nothing happened to the display, though it did not fall flat down the display. <br><br>  In general, the picture was as follows: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4b8/736/aaf/4b8736aaf37af473329adaeba310ec41.jpg" alt="image">

      Rash!!! <br><br>  Further, the decline of mood, because the device is only 3 months, a trip to ebey, etc.  Googling the Internet, I decided to try various programs from Google Play to restore dead pixels.  Their meaning is reduced to the fact that they heat the pixels by quickly changing the color of the screen image (or a separate part of it).  I worked the program to restore the pixels for about an hour and no changes on the screen, for the better, did not happen.  By evening, I began to notice that these "points" from broken pixels turned into stripes, with one of the stripes growing before my eyes.  In general, by the evening already had a bunch of horizontal stripes. <br><br>  While waiting for an answer with ebey who is the display manufacturer, read the forums and came across one topic where a guy with the same phone ran into the same problem as mine.  One fine winter evening, arriving home, he forgot the phone in the car, and the car spends the night outside.  On the street -15.  When he got into the car in the morning and took the phone off the lock, he saw that most of the ‚Äúdead‚Äù pixels miraculously came to life.  The next night I decided to leave the phone ‚Äúfreeze‚Äù again in the car and what do you think, every single pixel ‚Äúcame to life‚Äù. <br><br>  When I read that forum thread, I first thought that this was utter nonsense.  If I‚Äôm still going to order a display, then okay, I‚Äôll put it in the freezer (my wife reacted to that cautiously, but I didn‚Äôt explain anything).  Naturally pre-removed the battery, SIM card and card.  The whole night, of course, I could not stand it, pulled out after 5 minutes and was amazed, 1/3 of the dead pixels recovered in 5 minutes.  He put another 5 minutes, got it, the strips turned into points.  Then he became alert, because  after I took the phone out of the freezer, it was quickly covered with frost, which immediately melted, and this could lead to moisture in the display or oxidation of the contacts.  He no longer began to experiment and put it in the freezer until the morning. <br><br>  In the morning my expectations were met, absolutely all the pixels were restored. <br><br>  On communicators with capacitive touchscreens, the method of ‚Äúmassaging‚Äù pixels is not applicable (because touchscreens are hard and it is physically impossible to press on the display itself), although it is described as very effective. <br><br>  Also, some argue that freezing will shorten the life of the display ‚Äî nothing like that.  JVC mafon in a car with LCD display since 2005 lives there.  The car is on the street all year round, and we have frost in the north under -50 and in fact nothing happens to it and there is not a single broken pixel. <br><br>  So use. <br>  Good luck. <br><br>  <b>Important:</b> <br>  Not all displays are applicable.  This article only applies to my HTC Sensation.  The type of matrix TFT Super LCD (judging by the descriptions in the internet - <i>based on a liquid crystal matrix</i> ). <br>  I tried the same method to apply on the Nokia 6300 (There the usual TFT display is <i>based on a transistor matrix</i> ), the result was the opposite.  Points turned into stripes, and some yellow. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ead/9ae/87c/ead9ae87ce1282b7edd0cd8e1aa5bd71.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Possible explanation for this method</b> (thanks <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/oENDark/"><b>oENDark</b></a> ): <br><blockquote>  I will add: <br>  The broken crystal is in an energetically unfavorable position, it is ‚Äúcrooked‚Äù, so to speak, and in addition to the above, ‚ÄúFrost‚Äù makes it ‚Äútwist out‚Äù <br>  Because  an external impact in the form of a blow made it ‚Äútwisted‚Äù and added internal tension to it, the freezing takes part of its internal energy and it cannot resist internal tension and straightens. </blockquote><br><habracut></habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/143888/">https://habr.com/ru/post/143888/</a></p>
