    <h2>  Prehistory </h2><br>  On June 30, we added a search for mentioning the G20 summit; it was interesting how the information space responds to a fairly large event in the political world.  The first meeting of the presidents was expected, everything promised to be interesting.  Putin and Trump were tracked before, it is convenient to use them as comparative values ‚Äã‚Äãwhen analyzing unknown entities, but the ROC was somehow added from sports interest, I wanted to understand what was going on there at all. <br><br><h2>  Visualization </h2><br>  Here is the G20 mentions growth graph: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/568/84c/f81/56884cf81f86414683460d69284812d1.png"><br><br>  <a href="https://statoperator.com/research/information-waves-g20-summit-germany-hamburg/">Interactive Graph</a> <br><br>  By the time of the event, the number of references has increased from 10 to 40 thousand, this is really a big information wave, for scale, can be compared with Russian politicians: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/1db/bee/95f/1dbbee95ffae4ba88f5e29f7db81171f.png"><br><br>  <a href="https://statoperator.com/research/russian-politicians-racing-in-information-space/">Interactive Graph</a> <br><br>  TOP 1 Medvedev - 2.2k mentions, though it‚Äôs in Russian, but still.  It is noticeable as Poklonskaya pulled up on the 6th (that day she laid out porn cuts) <br><br>  Let's look at the surge in mentions of Putin and Trump on the day of the meeting: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/29a/59d/9f0/29a59d9f013544b59c37498607d3eaf1.png"><br><br>  <a href="https://statoperator.com/research/the-world-most-powerful-politicians-2017/">Interactive Graph</a> <br><br>  As we can see, for Putin this is the strongest surge of lately (in Latin, compare with the wave in a straight line for the 15th number), for Trump, in principle, too. <br><br>  If we consider the mention of Putin separately (in Cyrillic and Latin), the picture becomes more interesting: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/b51/95d/b38/b5195db389e74a8797271626164688b0.png"><br><br>  <a href="https://statoperator.com/research/information-waves-with-vladimir-putin/">Interactive Graph</a> <br><br>  Pay attention to the 15th, the straight line, the number of mentions of Putin in Cyrillic almost equal to the indicator in Latin, a huge surge.  One can notice the priorities of the Russian-speaking space, he is clearly more interested in internal affairs, it is noticeable that as the G20 approaches, Putin‚Äôs references to Russian in a completely different behavior in the English-speaking segment are gradually increasing. <br><br><h2>  And here PR PR? </h2><br>  If you look at the schedule of references to the abbreviations ROC: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/3e3/f93/5e8/3e3f935e89e649139b1be11749fad516.png"><br><br>  <a href="https://statoperator.com/research/russian-orthodox-church/">Interactive Graph</a> <br><br>  You can see how the Russian Orthodox Church is steadily increasing its presence on the Internet, HYIP.  Whether it is natural or PR is a question of a separate study, but it became interesting to us why the index of references to the Russian Orthodox Church collapsed on the day of the meeting of the presidents and we looked at the list of domains from which the abbreviation disappeared.  It turned out that this is 87% the same as those who helped to cover the G20 intensively in the Russian segment.  Maybe they sit in the same office?) <br><br>  We do not publish the lists of sites only for the reason that we are not sure of our legislative kung-fu in the sphere of counteracting the insult of the feelings of believers.  And in general, I would not like any policy, just an interesting measurement, known to all the sample. <br><br>  The data in the graphs are updated daily. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/332656/">https://habr.com/ru/post/332656/</a></p>
