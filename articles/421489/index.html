      - Any garbage discussed.  - Sergey did not sit down.  He went to the window sill, took a few eyes at the snowfall, and turned to his colleague. <br><br>  - What, really nothing interesting?  - asked Stas.  - You kind of wanted to discuss the reasons for discrepancies in the warehouse. <br><br>  - Well, they did.  Petrova ran into the chief accountant, she fought back.  About Stas said. <br><br>  - About me?  - Stas eyes rounded.  - Am I here in some side? <br><br>  - Yes, not you, but from Stas warehouse.  - Sergey answered.  - Mezentsev like.  Said, he tyt parts and drags them to the assembly. <br><br>  - Oh, yes, I know that.  - Stas left his head.  - Dummy such.  I got drunk on corporate parties, danced like mad.  Zadolbalsya his then send home. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  - Why?  Didn't want to leave? <br><br>  - Not at all.  - waved his hand Stas.  - He has a car, in short, no, he usually drives home from someone from the warehouse, and then - who are the lucky ones?  They called him a taxi, a young guy came, and that one ‚Äî well, Stas ‚Äî that ... In short, he vomited right in front of the car.  The taxi driver says - go on figs, I am not taking such a redneck, I have a new car. <br><br>  - Pf, like it's his car.  - Sergey answered.  - Probably from taxis. <br><br>  - No, we called Uber, he was on his own. <br><br>  - And what's the end?  - without much interest asked Sergey. <br><br>  - We decided that you can not enter the same river twice.  - laughed Stas.  - Once it has already been turned out, then this will not happen again.  They called another car, and he drove normally. <br><br>  - I see.  - Sergey nodded.  - Thanks for the interesting story. <br><br>  - You are welcome.  - Stas shrugged.  - There was really fun, you should not go in vain.  One well-known aunt even danced on the table.  Do you know who? <br><br>  - I do not know, and I do not want to know.  - cut off Sergei.  - That's why I do not go.  I do not want to see people in this state, then you will not understand how to treat them at work. <br><br>  - OK, as you want.  Let me tell you what it was at the meeting.  What are the reasons for the differences with us? <br><br>  - So, he told me about Stas ... - Sergey muttered thoughtfully.  - And, Petrova also said that she had worked before in some kind of Western system, and there she could not edit movements for past periods. <br><br>  - So we can not.  - Stas frowned.  - Glavbukh puts the date of the prohibition of editing, and no one can change anything else. <br><br>  - Well, when does she put it?  - Stas stopped frowning and broke into a smile.  - God forbid, if in a month.  I'll tell you so ... <br><br>  What did Stas want to say? It remains a mystery, because the door to the office swung open, and Galina entered it with a strange smile on her face, and Valeria, the chief accountant, followed her. <br><br>  - Sergey, what the hell again?  - It is strange, Galina seemed indignant, but a smile never left her face.  - Why accounting problems, and I have to solve them? <br><br>  Sergey stared at Galina.  What are you thinking again, viper subbrood?  Why are you smiling?  Why did you bring the chief accountant with you? <br><br>  - What's the problem?  - Sergei asked carefully. <br><br>  - Well, how ... - began Galina, looking intently at Sergey.  - The year is over, it is necessary to close, and you are worn with your projects (Galina singled out the letter ‚Äúe‚Äù especially).  Do you think that since you are working with the owner, can you now abandon your responsibilities? <br><br>  - I did not ask you, Galina.  - Sergey said as firmly as possible.  - Valeria, what's the problem? <br><br>  - Yes, I do not care who you asked!  - abruptly switched to screeching Galina.  - You are completely ohrenel, or what?  Will you tell me what to say, who to talk to, and when to talk?  Yes, I love you ... <br><br>  - So you can talk without me then?  - Sergey felt that he was beginning to blush.  The feeling was not pleasant. <br><br>  - Yes, talked already!  - Galina continued to shout.  - Do I have to work instead of you?  BUT?  While you are rushing at your meetings? <br><br>  - Great idea, by the way.  - Sergey pulled a smile on his face.  - Come on, show us the sample how to work.  And then where are we, lohushki bespontovymi, to your universal ... <br><br>  - Well, hold on!  - Galina raised her hand, pointed to Sergey and, for some reason, began to shake with this finger.  - I won't leave it like that!  I don't give a shit about your projects (hmm, there was no letter ‚Äúe‚Äù)!  But when you fail to hand over the reports, and we will get a fine, twenty percent of the proceeds, let's see how you smile! <br><br>  Sergei did not know how to curse, especially with such expressive ladies like Galina.  She - as an energy vampire, sucks all the energy when you succumb to provocation.  And every time I thought - what to do?  Shut up?  Then you will look like a loser - here after all a bunch of like-minded people.  Whoever shouts louder, is right, and who is silent - a rag. <br><br>  Speak?  What to say?  The conversation is clearly not about working questions.  Just a market, as in the yard sometimes happens, or on the market.  Oh, I managed to be born with an introvert. <br><br>  ‚ÄúI won't leave it either.‚Äù  - looking at his feet, Sergey said uncertainly.  - I didn‚Äôt give up any work duties, I fulfill all the tasks on time, what is the general complaint ... <br><br>  - Yes, in the same, in what and always!  - Galina did not let Sergey finish speaking.  As they said at the military department at the institute, it developed success.  - You stand here, umstvuesh, instead of working!  And for your shit I rake and listen every day. <br><br>  - Yes, you poor thing ... - Sergei plucked up arrogance and looked at Galina. <br><br>  ‚ÄúAll right, this is the end ...‚Äù Galina abruptly turned and walked quickly toward the door.  Before leaving, she stopped, turned around, raised her finger again and pointed at Sergey.  - Get ready for a serious conversation! <br><br>  And went out, slamming the door.  Valeria was confusedly silent.  Stas, as usual, was staring at the monitor and pretending that he was doing something very important.  Sergey's hands were shaking - as always, after talking with Galina. <br><br>  - Valeria, sit down!  - Stas pulled away from the monitor, pulled out a guest chair from under the table and moved it to Valeria.  - Come on, tell me what happened. <br><br>  - Have fun ... - said Valeria, sitting down on a chair.  - I don‚Äôt even know how to say something now.  I was not going to swear at all, Galina apparently had some kind of her own interests, so she took advantage of the moment. <br><br>  - So this is her job, to use the moments, catch the wave, and ride it, forward and up.  - Sergey said.  He walked away from the window, crouched in his seat, turned to Valerie.  - Come on, tell me what happened? <br><br>  ‚ÄúNothing much happened ...‚Äù Valeria shrugged.  - As always.  The year is over, it is necessary to close, check everything, so I went. <br><br>  - To Galina, why?  - Sergey sighed.  - It will not help you, she‚Äôs not a programmer. <br><br>  - Well, you were not there, so I looked at her.  - Valeria seemed a little outraged.  - What do I look for to run you? <br><br>  - Okay.  - Sergey said conciliatory.  - What is needed from us? <br><br>  - The girls will work in the evening, you will go home already.  - Valeria extinguished the growing fervor of the conflict.  - Give us access so that we can change documents for the entire year. <br><br>  - So you can.  - calmly said Sergey.  - I gave you the right to control access.  You can manage this process yourself. <br><br>  - Yes, I do not want to manage anything.  - Valeria said in a slightly elevated tone.  It seems, after all, the conflict can not be avoided.  - You are programmers, and you manage.  And I will say to whom some access to give. <br><br>  - Valeria, do you need it?  - Sergey was still hoping for a calm conversation.  Forces after Galina left.  - Run to us, ask, call in the evening and on weekends so that we give you this unfortunate access. <br><br>  - I'm not going to run to you!  - Valerie's tone was getting higher.  - I went in normally, and normally I ask - open everything to us (this word obviously had an accent)!  We will work quietly, and you will rest.  As always. <br><br>  - Ah, got it.  - Sergey nodded his head.  - Again, think that the system belongs only to you, and no rules affect you?  Give us this, give us that, complete freedom, no restrictions, are we going to shit in the base? <br><br>  - What is wrong with you!  - outraged Valeria.  - How do you even allow yourself to talk?  What is there in this database in general?  Who needs it, besides accounting? <br><br>  - Everyone needs, you know about the project?  - Sergey continued.  - Everyone wants to see there real data, numbers, for management and analysis. <br><br>  - Oh my God!  - suddenly smiled Valeria.  - Sergey, you are like a little.  They came up with some kind of nonsense there with Kurchatov ... Use figures.  Hatching did not use, but then suddenly the reins came under the tail. <br><br>  - Well, if you think so ... - Sergey spread his hands.  - What was silent at the meeting then?  When Kurchatov announced that order in the warehouse is the project of the year? <br><br>  - Nda ... - Valeria shook her head, looking at Sergey.  - Here you will become the head, you will understand what you need to say at meetings, and what you don‚Äôt. <br><br>  Sergey could not find the answer.  Where do they all come from, these teachers?  And in fact there is nothing special to object, he has almost no experience of leading work, how everything is arranged there - one can only guess.  You begin to talk about what you need to do, and not sit beautifully in the high cabinets ‚Äî they will laugh at the acne romance sighing about big and clean ... <br><br>  - So what, Sergey?  - Valeria unceremoniously interrupted thinking.  - Open access? <br><br>  - What documents will you fix?  - Sergey sighed. <br><br>  - What you need, and we will be.  - Valeria brazenly looked into his eyes, as if provoking. <br><br>  - Will you correct the movements in the warehouse?  - Sergey asked without any hope. <br><br>  - Firstly.  - Valeria did not take her eyes off. <br><br>  - Well, now we will give you full rights in the system.  - Sergey sighed again and looked at Valeria.  - And then according to the logs, we will see what and where you corrected. <br><br>  - Yes, you stare as much as you want.  - Valeria grinned, got up from the chair and headed for the door. <br><br>  - Why are you arguing with her?  - asked Stas, when the door behind Valeria closed.  - We always do this when they close a quarter or a year. <br><br>  - I argue that I need to put the warehouse in order.  - Sergey answered irritably.  - If earlier it was all the same, now - no.  How much can you stand in this position? <br><br>  - In what position?  - I did not understand Stas. <br><br>  - In the very same!  Knee-ulnar  To groan, but to give. <br><br>  - There you are like ... - Stas said protractedly.  - At the holy swung!  Do you want to have buchu right to pick up something?  On the data correction in hindsight? <br><br>  - Yes I want to.  Otherwise, nothing happens. <br><br>  - So they hang themselves.  - smiled Stas.  - For a Russian accountant, the impossibility of correcting the old school is worse than the apocalypse.  It is easier for them to do half the salary than to force the data to be correctly entered the first time.  Since childhood, all used to leave for later.  At the end of the quarter, or year, or in general ... <br><br>  - Well, this method of accounting is no longer suitable for us.  - Sergey said seriously.  ‚ÄúHaving so many people full access is a huge security hole in accounting.‚Äù <br><br>  - And what, how are you going to close this hole?  - Stas carefully looked at Sergey.  - Just beat up? <br><br>  - Hmm ... Hole ... In the fence ... - Sergei muttered thoughtfully. <br><br>  - What?  Which fence?  - genuinely interested in Stas. <br><br>  - Yes, so ... I remembered ... Now I will tell. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/421489/">https://habr.com/ru/post/421489/</a></p>
