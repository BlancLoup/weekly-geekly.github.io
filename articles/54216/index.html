  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Team management: simple truths</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Friends! <br><br>  The second seminar for startups from the project <a href="http://egenius.ru/">Egenius.ru was held</a> .  The topic discussed the following: "Management of a startup team."  Just want to apologize for the failure of the online broadcast.  On the site chopped off the Internet.  But still there were many interesting things.  Dima Braverman ( <a href="http:/www.smartcontext.ru/">SmartContext</a> ) gave practical advice, Yura Synodov told how he started a startup <a href="http://roem.ru/">Roem.ru</a> in the office of ‚Äúclass G‚Äù in a company with a programmer, a slacker and assistant programmer - a young alcoholic.  Video recording of the seminar and presentations of the speakers can be viewed / downloaded <a href="http://egenius.ru/seminar/arc.php%3Fcid%3D3">here.</a> <br>  And also, Dmitry's advice on managing the team seemed very useful to me, so I decided to share them with the public. <br>  So, <br><br>  <b>About terms:</b> 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"

          data-ad-format="fluid"

      <br>
      * When determining the project timeframe, the time required to solve the problem that the programmer called you, multiply by 2. What the designer says is by 3. <br>  * If a task takes too much time to solve, consider whether it is possible to abandon this task. <br>  * Even if a brilliant idea occurred to you - do not rush to implement it.  First, figure out which resources will require its decision, and then enter in the plan for the next release of the project <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>About the distribution of responsibilities:</b> <br><br>  * Do not force a person to do something for which he has neither ability nor desire.  The same programmer may be ideal for technical support, but be a bad developer.  And vice versa. <br>  * The main project is not the one who is the smartest.  The main one who gives the rest of the team members the answers to their questions. <br>  * It is bad when work on a project develops into joint alcoholization of team members. <br>  * The most valuable employee is the one who understands the tasks set from a half-word, delves into their essence (that is, it will not be possible to conditionally enter the house through the third floor because you made a typo when developing the plan) and helps to solve problems arising during the development process. <br>  * The most terrible employee is the one who acts strictly according to what is written, like a robot. <br><br>  <b>About freelancers:</b> <br><br>  * Be careful when hiring freelancers.  You have a great chance to pay a little money, but also to receive as little return.  Look for a person to whom not only your 50 (500, 5000) dollars are important, but also your own reputation. <br>  * You have to pay money not for the fact that someone ‚Äúworked‚Äù, but for the fact that this someone produced. <br><br>  <b>Pro savings:</b> <br><br>  It is better to do everything on time than to save money by increasing the time required for development. <br><br>  <b>About CMS:</b> <br><br>  * Boxed site management systems are cheaper than developing a site from scratch.  But they are only suitable for static projects.  Develop on such a platform, the project will be able to exactly the way the platform is arranged, and not how owners and developers want <br>  * Do not miss the opportunity to use software solutions from Open Source. <br><br>  <b>About salaries:</b> <br><br>  * Do not pay employees more than they requested.  Such motivation is meaningless, the employee will be afraid of excessive demands and doubt your adequacy. <br>  * You need to hire not the candidate who is cheaper, but the one who suits you best. <br><br>  <b>About dismissal:</b> <br><br>  It is necessary to dismiss an employee who does not solve problems, but, on the contrary, creates them.  Do not feel remorseful, parting with employees.  By this you do not kill either himself or his family.  You just make the project more viable. <br><br>  <b>About motivation:</b> <br><br>  * The main motivation is the employee‚Äôs faith in the project.  The one who asks at the interview about honey.  insurance and the presence of fresh buns in the office will not become a member of the team. <br>  * On the other hand, only a student, not a person burdened with family, financial obligations can afford to work only for an idea (and not for a decent salary). <br>  * Having received an option, the employee can relax if the option is an addition to the salary.  If it is proposed to work exclusively ‚Äúfor the future‚Äù - the employee may soon lose interest in the project and in the tasks to be performed. <br><br>  <b>About reporting:</b> <br><br>  * Employees will be willing to use only the system of setting tasks that is convenient and intuitive for them. <br>  * Discussion in words, without fixing in the system of setting tasks - a waste of time.  If not recorded, it means not done. <br><habracut></habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/54216/">https://habr.com/ru/post/54216/</a></p>
