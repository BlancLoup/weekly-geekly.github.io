  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Why is the work not an apartment?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In one of the topics on the theme of "Eternal Copyright" flashed another thesis of the copyright holders: <br><blockquote>  Moreover, copywriters have already brought the ideological base to it.  They say that the usual property rights are eternal, so why is IP worse?  And they always give an example: now you would like your apartment to become public property after N years after your death, and your heirs were simply thrown out of it?  But they did not earn it, just for inheritance just got ... </blockquote><br><br>  Let's figure it out? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  So, here is an apartment that your great-great-great someone got there. <br>  He handed it over to his son, the one to his son, the one to his, etc.  etc.  In the end, you got the apartment. <br>  By law, you and your ancestors are obliged to pay rent, pay for water, gas, electricity and other amenities of life.  Type of property tax, if the apartment is in private ownership. <br>  If you pay, then everything is OK, but even then there are subtleties, such as planning to build a new route through the area, or put the house down due to disrepair.

      This is the ‚Äúgeneral situation‚Äù if your apartment is the only living space. <br>  If not - there are subtleties in the style that for each subsequent apartment of yours the tax and rent will grow quite smartly.  Just for the very fact of owning a GREAT living space! <br><br>  ‚ÄúBut this area is not just with me!  I do not just have it!  There people live who pay me money for it! ‚Äù- a certain abstract citizen will be indignant. <br>  - Stop it!  - the official from tax will be delighted.  - Do you pay taxes for commercial activities ???  Yes, yes, from each apartment!  What, and surely profits exceed ... ???  Be so kind - taxes on higher rates, sir! <br>  Etc.  etc. <br>  Moreover, the market price tax and the rent rate depends on the size of the apartment !!! <br><br>  You can‚Äôt pay, there is a debt to pay rent, etc.  etc.?  The apartment will be confiscated, and you will be transferred to a communal apartment far away.  According to law.  In the same "public domain" apartment will go. <br><br>  And, yes, we are now talking about a "special case" when the apartment is honestly yours. <br><br>  There is also the so-called.  ‚ÄúProvided housing‚Äù: this is when something is to lure a prominent scientist to teach at an institution of higher education ‚Äî they are provided with an apartment for living from an institution of higher education.  Alas, according to the law, the apartment on the campus belongs to the university, no private property, and the sale of it to anyone! <br>  Here the heirs can even hang themselves - after the death of the teacher, the apartment is returned to the foundation of the university!  True, often one of his descendants continues to study and teach in the university, so in this case the apartment may be left. <br><br>  Now go to the works: <br>  Someone wrote a book and started selling it.  Well, actually, well done, keep it up, the state believes in you and will even try to protect against arrogant pirates. <br>  Is dead?  Sorry. <br>  And the heirs want money for writing a great ancestor? <br><br>  Is it a little different from apartments?  Yes?  Or maybe from something else ??? <br><br>  Ivan Ivanovich Ivanov was a retired labor worker - he worked the devil for how many years on construction sites, getting paid and paying taxes from it.  And then - retired from these taxes received.  But what a pity - the poor fellow died! <br>  And here comes, you understand, his son, Vasily Ivanovich, and declares: <br>  - How so - where is the grandmother!? <br>  - what are the grandmother?  - the people are surprised. <br>  - My father worked? <br>  - Have worked. <br>  - Received a pension? <br>  - Was getting! <br>  - Why don't you pay me ?! <br>  - FOR WHAT?! <br>  - For what he worked! <br>  Funny ??? <br>  This is a saying! <br>  Time passes, and the son died.  And here the grandson is declared and begins to demand that his grandfather‚Äôs pension now be paid to him!  After all, it was his grandfather who once worked! <br>  And then the great-grandson of indignation begins, that the deprived of his great-grandfather‚Äôs pension, etc.  etc. <br>  Rave?  Rave. <br>  Nobody takes his great-grandfather away from him: to be proud and tell everyone what kind of man he was, that he had worked for so many years and had a lot of things to build - no one bothers him.  But why should the state owe his great-grandfather a pension to pay it ?! <br><br>  Or some kind of thread Demian Demianich, an honored front-line soldier, went through the war from the first to the last day, danced a lezginka on the ruins of Berlin.  Chest in orders, etc.  etc. <br>  Owning medals and orders of great-grandfather and be proud of them - no one forbids descendants.  Can put in the window, that the people penetrated.  But what do you say about his grandson, who will fasten his grandfather's medals and go to the parade in them ??? <br><br>  Rave?  Blasphemy <br>  I don‚Äôt know, but now Milne‚Äôs descendants of Winnie the Pooh get even Milne‚Äôs retirement, and some leftist offices shine with the ‚Äúorders‚Äù of long-dead composers ... <br>  And spinning the keys to the ‚Äúperfectly honestly acquired apartment‚Äù on a finger, they argue that this is exactly how it should be. <br>  It's sad. <br><br>  PS Brad, confusion, etc.  etc.?  Wash already somehow pity.  And there, you see, great-great-great, what bonuses to karma will get if this nonsense develops in the same direction.  After all, plus the great-grandson in karma, if you liked the article?  True true??? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/179141/">https://habr.com/ru/post/179141/</a></p>
