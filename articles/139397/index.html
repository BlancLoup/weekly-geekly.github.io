  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to adapt the service for mobile platforms</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  With the fact that the mobile and tablet markets are among the fastest growing, today no one will argue.  This is a good point, many have a chance to turn the tide and win the second round, and for many sluggish there is every chance to stay only on the big web. <br><br>  In this connection, even radical approaches appeared when it was proposed to design primarily for mobile platforms, and then think about the big web (http://www.lukew.com/resources/mobile_first.asp).  This is a beautiful concept, but the harsh truth of life is that many services already exist in the web version and they need to step into the mobile world. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Let's understand how to adapt an existing service for mobile platforms.  At once I will make a reservation that we leave the tablets behind the brackets, there is a special conversation.  The second moment we take into account modern touch phones. <br>  In this article we do not consider the actual graphic design of the application.  Consider the stage that precedes the work with the interface designer.

      <b>First of all</b> , the mobile version is distinguished by user goals and scenarios.  Mobile service is almost always about here and now.  What will happen tomorrow or yesterday you are much less interested in: <br><ul><li>  in the mobile you watch the weather for today to decide whether to take an umbrella or not </li><li>  you are reading the current mail or messages, and do not delve into the history </li><li>  You are watching what traffic jams are now, but do not plan on getting to visit tomorrow </li></ul><br>  Remove from the first release all that relates to planning stories, long viewing, selection, etc.  In the comments, there will be shouts that it's not true, I do almost everything on my mobile.  This, of course, is true for a small part of the audience.  And for the first release, these scenarios are better viewed and set aside for the future.  When you implement them in 1.0+ do not forget to compare the frequency of their use in comparison with the current ones. <br><br>  Secondarily, the phone is still a bunch of additional information about the user: <br><ul><li>  do you know where it is with good accuracy </li><li>  you know that the phone is always near the owner (well, Android is sometimes at the outlet) </li><li>  you can safely take pictures and record voice </li></ul><br>  Fashionable LBS services are more likely to make sense, not as separate services, but as a specific addition to any existing service.  Use the user's position to filter out the information he does not need and do not ask him stupid questions. <br><br>  The phone is next to the owner, you can always remind him of something important and he will notice it.  For example, it is very useful to remind you that tomorrow is a cold snap or rain, if the service is weather.  The phone is the best option for reminders today. <br><br>  About recording photos, voices - most likely there will be completely separate scenarios that are not in the large version of your service.  This is really a whole direction for new opportunities. <br><br>  Think at your leisure, because there are still a lot of interesting pieces: an accelerometer, an altimeter, a gyroscope, etc. <br><br>  <b>Thirdly</b> : the Internet.  In the mobile it is slower, much slower and it may not be. <br><br>  Ineta freebie will not be worth the move to another region or country, waiting for you roaming.  And unfortunately he will not die soon.  But even if you have fully paid for the service, the Internet begins to disappear even within large cities.  Modern base stations often provide a very poor signal in closed courtyards, even in the city center.  About the country tracks silent. <br><br>  Hence the conclusion your application should survive without the Internet.  Let not 100% functionality, but the application should remain useful. <br><br>  <b>The last moment</b> , the service is left alone.  The mobile option is the continuation of the web, the continuation of the mobile web.  The user in this case uses one service, but not two different ones.  The service should remember where the user stayed, what the last person watched or searched for, what he put in his bookmarks.  Consider scenarios that affect both platforms.  Without this bundle, your service today will be seriously inferior to competitors. <br><br>  Total: <br><ul><li>  Split scenarios, what for mobile and what for a large service. </li><li>  think about which scenarios now affect both platforms </li><li>  What information from the mobile service will help to be smarter </li><li>  think about the world with bad internet </li><li>  make the service as simple as possible, do not add information or actions if you are not 100% sure that they are necessary </li></ul><br><br>  I will be very grateful for any additions or comments on this topic. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/139397/">https://habr.com/ru/post/139397/</a></p>
