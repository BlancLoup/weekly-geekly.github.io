      Politicians and scholars, pop stars and writers, athletes and journalists confidently live in virtual social networks.  Not having your blog is already becoming almost indecent for the representatives of the world elite.  The latest bright example is the new US President Barack Obama, who was even nicknamed ‚ÄúCandidate 2.0‚Äù during the election campaign and who was largely indebted to his unprecedented campaign to promote the Web and the blogosphere. <br><br>  Obama chose the most effective approach to communication on the Internet, creating a personal leadership social network dedicated to the upcoming elections.  Members of its network independently organized various events, actively participated in the campaign of their leader.  The personal social network has helped Obama in many ways to mobilize the potential of supporters and successfully conduct an election campaign.  World political history will now be divided into periods before and after the 2008 presidential election in the United States.  Now it will become clear to many in the status elite of different countries of the world that active work on the Internet is an inevitable condition for achieving success. <br><br>  So, representatives of the political, economic, creative elites are trying to overcome the abnormal situation of status mismatch, to support their position in the real world with high authority on the world wide web.  Traditional personal sites and blogs can not fully solve this problem.  Obviously, more effective formats and ways to promote on the Internet are required.  New platforms for the realization of the public potential of the leaders will be their social networks, like the one that the newly elected US President has organized. <br><br>  Such projects may be of an image or (and) commercial nature.  That is, to work on improving the status of a leader, the implementation of his social tasks and (or) to bring him a material profit. <br><br>  In this case, companies providing social networking services will be able to earn money by creating and maintaining leader networks.  They can be paid for by the leaders themselves in the case of non-commercial image projects.  But the most promising direction of social networking business should be commercial leadership networks.  These projects will focus on the monetization of attention to persons and content leaders of a large number of users.  They will bring substantial income to the organizers.  It is behind them, in my opinion, the future of the social network business. <br><br>  <b>Social networks in reality and the Internet</b> <br><br>  In the real world, social networks are a tool for social exchange and are based on horizontal and vertical exchange chains linking their members.  In horizontal chains, participants exchange equivalent resources - for example, equivalent labor or social resources.  The vertical hierarchy is formed based on the level of control over a key network resource.  Upstairs - the owners of maximum control, at the bottom - the minimum. <br><br>  Stable networks are more often built around people or structures that control a key resource that network participants exchange (power, authority, money, etc.).  Leaders exchange this key resource for member resources.  Such networks have a pyramidal structure [1]. <br><br>  Similarly, more complex social organizations are built: from company to state (see table). <br><br><img src="http://offline.computerra.ru/upload/upload/759-13-1.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Often the network is also a means of social mobility.  A participant can get access to a key network resource and become one of its leaders.  An ordinary party member has a hypothetical chance to become a politician.  A fan of stars - to draw attention to yourself and become a star yourself.  The employee of the company - to stand out in the heads. <br><br>  Social sharing within the network is not an end in itself.  Network structures always have an external ideal task, common to all network members.  Leaders unite people for the sake of: achieving power (party), supporting athletes (fans), worshiping stars (fans), making money (companies), maintaining order (state), performing religious rituals (church), etc., etc. The participants, under their leadership, realize common collective goals.  If this does not happen, the network sooner or later falls apart, people leave, the leaders fall down. <br><br>  The network, depending on its purpose, creates an exclusive cultural context, environment, style: from brutal in fans to glamorous in fans of pop stars. <br><br>  The current large social networks on the Internet (from Odnoklassniki to LJ) are a chaotic jumble of people connected by horizontal disordered communications.  This is essentially not a network, but a crowd, randomly gathered in one place. <br><br>  <b>Leadership Future</b> <br><br><img src="http://offline.computerra.ru/upload/upload/759-14-1.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The Internet is not a new reality, but a cast of the existing social world.  Networks on the Internet will be built on the same principles as in reality.  They will inevitably form around resource-leader leaders.  The key resource in such networks is content.  Content generators (new knowledge, creative achievements, information) exchange it for the attention of other users, which can be monetized (turned into paid services or sold to advertisers). <br><br>  It is the content generators that are most likely to become leaders in social networks.  Their online resources can be called user attention nodes.  Leadership networks on the Internet will be created around these resources [2]. <br><br>  And at first this role will be best mastered by real social leaders.  After all, the information coming from them and about them attracts the most attention of users. <br><br>  Among the creators of resource-attention nodes can be real community leaders (professional, consumer, amateur, political, religious), stars (show business, science, medicine, art, business), specialists in various fields, writers, journalists, and also active consumers sharing with users valuable consumer information. <br><br>  Such resources can be created not only by persons, but also by companies that have exclusive information channels (media, parties, analytical centers). <br><br><img src="http://offline.computerra.ru/upload/upload/759-15-1.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Leadership networks will enable organizing companies to make money by selling advertising and various network services. <br><br>  They will allow the leaders to create image and social tasks through the creation of a personal network of supporters and interested parties.  In addition, owners of leadership resources will also be able to monetize public attention to their own person.  For example, to receive, in coordination with the organizing company, a part of the network revenues.  And also make money selling fans directly through the resource of their own creative products. <br><br>  Users will be able to communicate with stars and leaders through such networks, observe events in their life and work, as well as receive quality information on various spheres of human activity in direct dialogue with the best specialists.  It is also important that users will be able to demonstrate their own creative and social achievements to reference persons (the owners of the nodes of attention nodes) that are reference for them.  And thanks to this, they will get a chance for social advancement in the real world. <br>  Types of leadership networks <br><br>  Leadership networks can be: <br><ul><li>  social networks formed around a personal or corporate online resource; </li><li>  social networks built around several resources - nodes of attention. </li></ul><br><br><img src="http://offline.computerra.ru/upload/upload/759-16-1.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In the first case, a personal or corporate site serves as a network interface.  Users register on it and get the opportunity to create their own blogs.  They communicate with the site owner and with each other, participate in joint collective social activities.  Such leadership networks will become a new generation of personal resources, following websites and blogs on social networks [3]. <br><br>  In the second case, the network is formed around a number of leadership resources and is united by a common goal, stylistics, thematic social environment [4]. <br><br>  <b>Social networking services for leadership networks</b> <br><br>  The main task of social networking companies in leadership networks is to help create and maintain resources ‚Äî nodes of attention. <br><br>  Organizing companies should motivate leaders to participate in networks and ensure their effective communication with other users.  Everyone wants to attract stars for the effective development of networks, but no one knows how to do it.  Probably the most important motivation is financial.  Companies will have to share part of their income with leaders. <br><br>  Stars are often lost in an alien Internet environment.  They have no time to blog, chat with visitors.  In order for the "star" resources to "play", the companies of the "network leaders" need to save the leaders from the problems with creating and maintaining blogs and communications in the network. <br><br>  It is also important to create a harmonious combination of themes and style of the network: its image, content, communication architecture.  Without this, even the brightest leaders will not be interesting to users.  For example, pop stars attract attention primarily in the bright glamor environment created especially for them (as in glossy magazines and on TV).  Therefore, in LiveJournal or in the My World network, the stars ‚Äúdo not work‚Äù, they are lost and fade.  In the new leadership networks, their resources, ‚Äúworlds,‚Äù should be created with the help of exclusive design, 3D graphics, and modern technologies. <br><br>  It is necessary not only to ‚Äúlure‚Äù interesting characters into the network, but also to help them make their own attractive resource.  The task of the company is to create leadership resources that, with their high technological and artistic level, reinforce the interest of the public to their owners. <br><br>  For other ‚Äúnormal‚Äù users, organizing companies need to create on-line communication tools that give a chance for social success (contests, direct communication with leaders, etc.). <br><br><img src="http://offline.computerra.ru/upload/upload/759-17-1.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Leaders, to make their resource popular, must constantly communicate online with users.  Without help this task is impossible.  To solve it requires constant content support from the organizing company.  Centralized support is much more efficient and cost-effective than the work of individual personal assistants.  As part of social networking companies, content management teams can be created that work closely with the owners of leadership resources.  With their help, operational support of communications of a significant number of leadership resources in the network can be carried out [5]. <br><br>  The content and style of the web must match.  Let's compare three possible variants of leadership networks [6]. <br><br>  <b>Mass media and corporations as leadership networks</b> <br><br>  Online versions of print media can also organize their work as a leader social network.  Journalists' blogs will be the focus of this network.  Readers, bloggers will be able to chat online with editorial staff and discuss publications and news. <br><br>  At the same time, the media will retain a unique style and image.  Vedomosti will remain business, and AiF will be a people's newspaper.  The media will not lose their own editorial policy, but it will be implemented through the blogs of journalists.  Simply, the media will know that they are paid not only for writing materials, but also for maintaining their own blog, communicating with readers, and answering their questions. <br><br>  As in other leading networks, the institute of social mobility can be provided for in the work of online versions of newspapers and magazines.  Distinguished users, whose blogs will be the most interesting, will be published in the paper version of the publication and even invited there for a permanent job. <br><br>  Corporations, like other social structures, can create their own Internet versions in the form of a leadership network.  Such a network may consist of a closed internal corporate network and an open network for communication with consumers and partners. <br><br>  Organization of the company as a network allows you to save on rent, more effectively manage staff, establish direct contact with consumers for the promotion and sale of goods and services.  To consumers, the company's social network will allow receiving independent information about goods and services from its network partners, and purchasing products directly without intermediaries. <br><br>  <b>Why the crisis is not terrible leadership networks</b> <br><br><img src="http://offline.computerra.ru/upload/upload/759-18-1.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Unlike regular websites, blogs in networks and standalone blogs, a new kind of leadership resources creates a personal social network around itself.  This network includes representatives of the target audience of the resource owner (its fans, supporters, interested parties).  The formation of such a network provides stable interactive communications with visitors, the ability to exert a constant influence on their consumer and social behavior.  Communication in the leadership network creates the effect of an emotional unification of users around the leader in the ‚Äúone team‚Äù, ‚Äúcommon cause‚Äù. <br><br>  Compared to personal websites and blogs, leadership resources have higher interactivity, more effectively form a communication environment, and give visitors better opportunities for self-expression. <br><br>  Unlike blogs in ordinary networks (such as LJ), they exist in a specially created enabling environment where it is impossible to get lost or be compromised by an inadequate network environment;  give their authors the opportunity to monetize the attention of visitors. <br><br>  On the Internet, there are no open networks focused on communication with leaders.  I am sure that in the near future they will appear and become one of the most popular resources. <br><br>  Companies that create and maintain leadership networks will not only be able to stay afloat during the crisis, but will also achieve impressive success.  After all, these networks will help people realize their aspirations that are relevant to any economic situation: make a career, earn money, engage in creative work, follow the life of stars, communicate with their idols, receive exclusive information from specialists, and solve common social problems together with like-minded people. <br><br>  Link to the article <a href="http://offline.computerra.ru/2008/759/387421/">Business that will survive the crisis</a> <br><br>  <b>Briefly about a wonderful person:</b> <br><br>  Eidman Igor Vilenovich - sociologist, author of the book ‚ÄúBreakthrough into the Future.
