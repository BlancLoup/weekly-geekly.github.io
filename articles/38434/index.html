All the teachers insisted that it was useless for me to study not only at the institute, but also in the senior classes, in view of my lack of talent.  Naturally, I did not like it very much, and I decided to become the best in school.

      The attempt to understand the program of the eighth grade failed due to the lack of elementary knowledge of previous classes (starting from the second or third), which left me no choice but to start learning all the subjects in a new way, on my own. <br><br>  I took textbooks in all subjects from elementary grades and began to read and outline them.  Immediately I realized that with the current reading speed, with an undeveloped memory, with a low note taking rate, inability to concentrate, with numerous friends from the yard, classmates and the sports section, I can hardly learn all the school material in five years. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  My decision was completely simple. <br>  Before you learn, you need to know the methodology of how to learn.  I went to the library for the methodology.  Year, I went to study the methodologies of learning and studying the school program for the 3rd and 4th grades and attempts to understand the program of the eighth grade.  But by the end of the eighth, I already knew exactly how I should study. <br>  During the summer holidays before the ninth grade, I studied the program of the fifth and sixth grade.  In the ninth grade I studied the seventh, eighth grade programs and almost caught up with classmates on the ninth grade program.  During the summer holidays after the ninth grade, I completely caught up with my classmates and read the tenth grade textbooks.  In the tenth grade I already became a regular participant in competitions in chemistry, physics, mathematics and biology, and almost an excellent student. <br><br>  At the institute, my efficiency increased significantly, and despite the monstrous amount of material, in my intensive sports and various social activities, I became the best student and graduate of the university. <br><br>  What is the secret of personal effectiveness?  There are a great many publications on this topic, almost everywhere they write the same thing, but in different words.  In this article I want to make and contribute to those who are still interested in my approach to this issue. <br>  I decided to build this material as simply as possible, in the form of algorithms and simple axioms.  Axioms, not taken from books, but those that I checked on myself and that helped me personally. <br><br>  But all this looks like in a fairy tale about an ugly duckling with a beautiful ending of history.  Life is not so simple.  I ran into a whole heap of problems that I had not noticed before, but which pulled me back and prevented me from developing. <br><br><h4>  <b>Chapter 1. Personal Problems</b> </h4><br><br>  I found the following problems in my <br><br>  1. I have little energy.  "Batteries" quickly "sit down."  It is extremely hard for me to push myself for any action, but when I start the action I get tired quickly and I want to sit down or lie down and rest; <br><br>  2. I cannot collect my thoughts, focus, concentrate on reading, work for more than three to five minutes.  Thoughts begin to hover somewhere in the future, in the past, in fantasy, anywhere, but not in the subject of the subject; <br><br>  3. I can not refuse my friends to sit with them, drive the ball, play something, I am ashamed to look in their eyes as a ‚Äúzauchka‚Äù, ‚Äúmama's son‚Äù and so on; <br><br>  4. I can not get up early in the morning.  Whenever the alarm clock rings, I lie in bed to the very limit, and often lying in bed I think that nothing will change if I am late; <br><br>  5. I'm bored to read most of the useful books and articles, they seem to be written in the most boring language, without fantasies, going from empty to empty and so on; <br><br>  6. I cannot read books from cover to cover, leaf through the book, choose something new or interesting; <br><br>  7. I do not understand many terms and words; <br><br>  8. After reading the book, I can not remember what was written there; <br><br>  9. My fantasies seem so real, and the sensations in fantasies are so alive that it seems uninteresting to act, and the experience seems to have already been experienced; <br><br>  10. I can not quickly find the desired thing, it takes a lot of time and nerves until you find what you were looking for; <br><br>  11. It is not easy for me to speak with a stranger, and even more so before an audience; <br><br>  12. I quickly catch fire with the idea, and I quickly cool down to it; <br><br>  13. I criticize any criticism very deeply and attribute it to my personality; <br><br>  14. I do not know what I want to achieve not only in life, but even this year, month or week; <br><br>  15. I do everything very slowly, slowly; <br><br>  16. I don‚Äôt do the work until the end, quickly, finish the job started in a rough way and switch to a new one; <br><br>  17. Having planned tasks for a period of time, I do not fulfill my plan, finding hundreds of reasons; <br><br>  18. I constantly look for and find ‚Äúexcuses‚Äù, reasons and reasons why I didn‚Äôt, or didn‚Äôt, wrong, not in time, and I reproach myself for the lack of will power; <br><br>  19. In conversation, I cannot convey the essence of my thoughts, moreover, it seems to me that I understood the interlocutor, but in actual fact it turns out that it is not quite; <br><br>  20. I do not notice the changes, I do not notice the reactions of people or their changes, having once labeled them, I do not change my attitude towards them; <br><br>  If you have less difficulties than I indicated here, then you are lucky, you are in a much better position than I once was.  Of course, I had more problems than these twenty, but it seems to me that they were the most crucial for me. <br><br>  These problems were for me like a vicious circle - one supported the other and carried me away, kept me from developing, from changing.  Imagine - with the torment of reading a book - I forgot it.  I took it again and read it.  Closed and again did not remember.  At the same time, I forgot on which page I stopped, where the book itself lies.  I was tired of reading, especially since I read ten to twenty minutes each page.  It was hard labor.  Read the same thing, instead of going outside and sitting with the boys in the gazebo, go to the park, to the amusement park!  When I was reading in the summer, on the balcony, the games in the yard were constantly distracting me, I went to my room, sat by the window.  It was no less interesting to watch the passersby, the passengers at the bus stop, the birds, the clouds, the rain ... I wanted to quickly flip through the book, look at the pictures ... and throw it away ... <br><br>  So, I had a lot of problems.  And I did not want to be greyness and mediocrity.  At that time there was no literature, as today, on the formation of one‚Äôs own destiny, on personal development, on achieving success and so on, it was the mid-70s, the heyday of the ‚Äústagnation‚Äù of the Brezhnev era! <br><br>  Since then, it took about thirty years.  A number of simple but effective rules have significantly changed me, my life.  In spite of the fact that all new and new difficulties and trials fell during these years. <br><br>  <b>What are the rules that I experienced for myself?</b> <br><br><h4>  <b>Chapter 2. Rules of personal effectiveness</b> </h4><br><br>  <b>1. Stop communicating with those whom you do not want to be like, or who ‚Äústeal‚Äù your time, in communication with whom you do not develop;</b> <b><br></b> <br>  - it may be your friends today, your relatives, classmates, fellow students, colleagues; <br><br>  - this decision is difficult, tough, sometimes cruel, but absolutely necessary; <br><br>  - no one says that you should forget such communication and pastime forever, but for 3-5 years, this is definitely the case; <br><br>  <b>2. Immediately stop work, reading, as soon as I felt that your thoughts ‚Äúfloated away‚Äù, get up and begin to think especially hard about where your thoughts floated.</b>  <b>And so every time;</b> <br><br>  - it's okay if at first you will run from corner to corner, but you will not force yourself to hang on where you have already lost concentration and will ‚Äúcatch‚Äù concentration on where she went, thereby accustoming yourself to the combination thought - concentration "; <br><br>  <b>3. Read from cover to cover without missing a page, footnote, comments or digressions.</b> <br><br>  - it seems stupid, but this discipline will teach you to do the work from the beginning to the end, to assimilate the material in a holistic manner, not in pieces, and will give the prerequisite of saving time in the future; <br><br>  - be sure to underline with a pencil or text with a marker everything that you liked or seems like it will be useful in the future.  It's okay if you will underline page by page; <br><br>  - if you study some special topic and you have to read several books and articles, then always start with the thickest and fullest book on the topic.  Last read the most delicate book, article; <br><br>  <b>4. Outline in a thick notebook all that stressed.</b> <br><br>  - note that you first need to read and underline.  And only after you have finished working with a book or text, proceed to note-taking; <br><br>  - in the abstract, leave space for additional entries from other books, articles; <br><br>  <b>5. Write down the summary (create your own book).</b> <br><br>  - how strange it does not sound, but if you want to study the topic and acquire a stable expertise and remember, then after you outline the material from different sources into one thick notebook, rewrite it in accordance with your logic and structure; <br>  - after this, ‚Äúthrow out‚Äù all the books that you used when taking notes, and do not return to them - you have a clean synopsis, and a draft! <br><br>  <b>6. Read quickly!</b> <br><br>  - Of course, it sounds easy, but how to learn it?  First, now there are a lot of books on speed reading, which probably will not help you (if you have similar problems, as I did).  Secondly, it takes a lot of time, which you don't have !; <br>  So use simple things to speed up the speed of reading. <br><br>  Never go back to the read pages, lines, words, even if it seems to you that you do not remember what it was about; <br>  Do not drive a finger, pointing at the line; <br>  Do not mumble and speak the words, just look at the words, one word after another, one sentence after another; <br>  Do not think about the read words, sentences, paragraphs.  Do not comprehend what you read; <br>  Do not forcefully remember what is written; <br>  Do not get distracted when you read.  Just browse through the lines and work as a marker; <br><br>  - the fact is that your brain does not need at all that you think on purpose and slowly!  It works too fast, and do not detract from its merits.  In addition, when you take notes, and twice, you still read a couple of times; <br><br>  <b>7. Do not pull the rubber!</b> <br><br>  - always you yourself are the limiter of your speed and only because you are not concrete or do not make a decision right away.  Give the answer to any question right away - yes or no, if so, when.  It makes no sense to take time to think, it will not help anyone; <br><br>  - in a conversation, with someone it wasn‚Äôt asked to immediately talk about the essence and what the person wants from you, all the prefaces and explanations are usually meaningless.  To recheck, rephrase the essence of the interlocutor and give the answers that he expects to receive from you.  And answer right away; <br><br>  - do not argue.  Disputes is a waste of time.  It makes no sense for you to convince someone of something.  And if you have your own point of view, then why are you someone else?  But if there is a dialogue, a discussion of the issue, and you feel that your point of view is not correct - immediately tell about it and stop the conversation; <br><br>  - better to do than to think.  All the same, you don‚Äôt think everything out in advance.  And if you start a business, you will at least get experience, even if the action was wrong, and if it was not wrong, you will already do a lot; <br><br>  - do not expect a better situation or circumstances.  It may not come.  Speak immediately, come right away, proceed immediately.  Why wait for all the guests to gather?  Start eating.  Why wait for all colleagues to gather?  Go talk right away.  Why wait until the new year comes, Monday, the alarm will ring, the boss will come, the cancer will whistle on the mountain?  Start now! <br><br>  <b>8. Do not wait for others.</b> <br><br>  - It is foolish to wait until your associates do something, say, cook.  Do it yourself, even if it's not your task!  Do not expect that others will do for you or do their work in the best way and exactly on time.  Remember, they are the same as you are slow, not concentrated, with bad memory, get tired quickly and find a million excuses! <br><br>  <b>9. Do not think!</b> <br><br>  - Just do it.  You need to write an article, abstract, report - do not think, take a pen with paper and write!  Need to speak - do not think, speak!  Need to buy - do not think buy!  Not a problem, if you write nonsense, say nonsense, buy a marriage.  But you are on the path to personal development and efficiency, and the rest is production waste! <br><br>  <b>10. Do not complain and do not pity yourself.</b> <br><br>  - it is not interesting to anyone, it will not help you, it will return you to the old positions; <br><br>  - you are not dead and this is important.  Get up and go!  You will feel sorry for yourself in the next world, there you will have time for the sea! <br><br>  <b>11. Use in speech new words and terms.</b>  <b>Specially.</b> <br><br>  - and how do you still want to remember them?  Writing in a notebook and dragging in a pocket?  No, only actively using in speech.  If someone does not understand you, this is his problem.  But if necessary, give a precise definition of the word; <br><br>  <b>12. Do not sit, staring blankly at (window, TV, wall, sky, ceiling, water, fire, nape, eyes, mirror, picture, monitor, sheet of paper, fly, etc.).</b> <br><br>  - as soon as you catch yourself for meaningless contemplation - get up and start the next task; <br><br>  - if you are tired - do exercises, walk, breathe; <br><br>  - the only exception is if you meditate.  But be sure that you are not deceiving yourself and do not call stupid contemplation with a bunch of thoughts in the skull with meditation; <br><br>  <b>13. Tired.</b>  <b>Out of energy</b> <br><br>  - Brad.  If in the next room to a person close to you, a needle is stuck in your eye, if you have terrible diarrhea, if fragments of broken glass fly on you - you will rise and run, and you will not lie like a corpse!  So energy is still there!  Do you think your blood glucose is over, liver glycogen is over, hormones are no longer produced?  Then you have already died, or are in intensive care.  Call you an ambulance? <br><br>  - Why can children move tirelessly all day?  Why is Louis de Phineas constantly on the move?  Do you think they are eating and drinking only energy mixers and tonics?  And after 8 - 16 - 24 hours of work you suddenly fell off and think that you are tired?  Then read rule number 10. <br><br>  - Do you think athletes, as tired, and sit down to relax?  Do you think the researchers, as tired, immediately go to drink beer at the TV?  Do you think the soldiers in the war, as tired, so go to sleep?  No, you do not think so.  As soon as it seems to you that you, poor fellow, are tired - get up and do the work faster and more!  Stop fooling yourself.  Others don't care about you. <br><br>  <b>14. Are you bored?</b> <br><br>  - what about your intellect?  And with fantasy?  Any normal person, even if he is a dumb oligophrenic, but not yet a moron, will be able to come up with a hundred reasons why, at first glance, the most boring occupation is adventure and joy! <br>  Why do other people with high do that job that you find boring?  Just because they have brains, intelligence and fantasy.  If you do not have all this, then how did you read to this point? <br><br>  <b>15. You are asked, and you can not refuse?</b> <br><br>  - a great tool to speed up your work!  Do not refuse, and do.  Quickly, even faster, with a high and forget about the psychology of the imbeciles - that you are ‚Äúdriven‚Äù and ‚Äúused‚Äù by you!  This is your training!  Do the work for yourself, for your neighbor, colleague, for everyone around.  Let them become lazy, fatten their brains and body!  And remember the rules number 10 and number 13! <br><br>  At bedtime, when I am ready to sleep, check what you have learned today and what benefits you have brought. <br><br>  - remember your day in the morning, and until you go to bed.  What are your day's assets?  No assets or they are scanty?  And what then lay down?  Tired?  See rule number 13. Get up, stop rolling.  How can you so stupidly spend the day?  Do business  And nothing fatal if you work all night until four or seven in the morning.  You will not die from it.  Go further.  You will sleep next night.  If, however, you do something sensible for that day, otherwise you get up again and work. <br><br>  <b>16. What is the point?</b> <br><br>  - What is the point of making your way completely to the bank, if, having considered the money, you returned with nothing?  What is the point of buying a car if you don‚Äôt ride it?  What is the point of jumping with a parachute, if you do not open it?  So, what's the point you start some kind of business, if you do not bring it to completion?  Do not start anything if you do not finish.  If you started, then at least die, but complete the job.  Do you think that this rule is contrary to the rules No. 7 and 8?  You're wrong!  Think yourself.  If you do not understand, read rule number 9. <br><br>  <b>17. Communication problems?</b> <br><br>  - Shy, shy, modest, quiet?  Anytime and anywhere?  And at school and in the yard and at home, and when one?  Are you ashamed of your appearance, speech, stupidity, poverty, environment?  Weeping, irritable, anxious, suspicious, quick-tempered?  Do your emotions shake you inside and out?  Are you a slave to the environment?  Your emotions do not depend on you?  You do not control yourself?  Isn't it emotional?  Have you ever done physical exercises or at least once in your life brushed your teeth?  And your emotions cleaned?  Coached them?  Not??!!!  That is, you think your emotions, your brain, your intellect themselves must train, wash, develop?  Maybe your car, your socks, your aquarium should also be repaired and washed by themselves?  Surely your socks or underwear are washed more often than your brains and emotions, and your legs train more intensively than your head!  And who is to blame?  See rules No. 10, 12 and 15. Listen, if you scream, obmatch, cry, take offense - will you solve the problem?  If so, then you are a happy person and you can throw away this book.  It is not for those who are so effective in life, but for those who are looking for their own path to development! <br><br>  - if you can't wait to shout, shout, say something, do not think, speak, but quietly, as quietly as possible, so that you can barely hear it; <br><br>  - if you want to mutter, in the insult swallowing saliva, do not think, speak, but clearly, separately, by syllables; <br><br>  Tell me, do you move your hands and tongue yourself, or do you twist your arms so that you make a gesture with them, and for your tongue you are driven with tongs in your mouth, so that you say the word?  So maybe you have electrodes in your brain and they stimulate the appearance of your emotions?  Yes?  Sorry, I didn't know you were a mouse or a monkey in the lab!  Your emotions are yours.  Although, if you like it - let you remain an emotional puppet, a doll programmed by other people's actions. <br><br>  Clean your brains and train!  Yes, I understand how difficult it is for a dead body or an obese mass to pull up or push in at the beginning.  But if the body is trained, it can greatly shape and not change, but it can perform various physical exercises and undergo loads without suffering.  And your brain?  Unwashed for years, dystrophic from malnutrition of mental food, or overfed burs from the lack of mental movements ?! <br><br>  <b>18. No will power, do not know their goals.</b> <br><br>  So can you just go hang yourself?  Maybe go to a neighbor and ask him what are your goals?  By force of will - read the rules ‚Ññ‚Ññ 2, 7 - 10, 12 - 16. <br><br>  By goals.  I agree, it's hard to sit down like this and immediately formulate your goals in life.  But no one demands from you that here and now you should cut them in stone forever!  Use rules No. 1 and 7. <br><br>  You can not formulate their long-term goals or goals for several years, or for several months?  Or do you get them general and non-specific?  Buy a three-story house, a cool car, get married, have smart and beautiful children, open a profitable business, earn 500 thousand dollars a clean year, get yourself and give children a Western education, become a famous TV presenter, help the world, civilization, parents, brothers - sisters , become the best hairdresser, pump up, learn Chinese?  Something from this opera, in one or another variation?  How do you think, how many people think like you?  Not less than a couple of billions!  And how many have reached their?  No more than a million!  Why so little?  See the answer in the list of my problems ‚Ññ ‚Ññ 1-20 <br><br><h6>  <b>What is success?</b> </h6><br>  Perhaps it would be worth starting with.  But the point is not in the sequence.  And in the answer to this question for you.  So what is success for you?  I think that you aspire to it, consciously or not, and you understand that personal effectiveness is an instrument of achievement.  And until you decide to develop a program of personal effectiveness, tantamount to intense physical training without having a clue in which sport you will have to compete. <br><br>  Your success is (choose only one, sorry): <br>  - a lot of money itself multiplying? <br>  - fame and popularity, career, recognition? <br>  - happy family, loyal friends? <br>  - inner harmony and freedom? <br>  - struggle and victory, overcoming difficulties? <br>  - influence and power? <br><br><h6>  <b>Action program</b> </h6><br>  There are a lot of tools, concepts and approaches to the development of personal effectiveness and they all work.  It's like a set of keys to different locks, where the lock is you yourself, and the keys are the tools and approaches to development.  Feel free to try different keys.  Do not hope to immediately find the master key!  It is necessary to grind for you specifically! <br><br>  <b>Here you need to make a small digression.</b> <br>  The fact is that in fact there are a lot of smart and not quite books on the development of personal effectiveness, on achieving success and so on.  But the problem with many of these books is that, by giving absolutely correct and wise things, they are not designed for the ordinary, mediocre person that you and I are.  If you were not mediocre, you would not read this book, would you?  So, most of these books, no matter how emotionally and vividly, wisely and with stories were written, they have not helped you so far.  And do not help.  A pity, there are written very wise things.  That's just a pity, it is not written what you do.  Therefore, in order to facilitate your transition from eyes to arms and legs (bypassing the brain), that is, from smart lines of smart books into your real actions, I will give a number of simple rules. <br><br><h5>  <b>Rule A. Become what you are capable of becoming.</b> </h5><br>  Who are you now?  Loser and Gray ?!  Recognized person with disgust and indignation reading these lines?  "Shestera" run errands, peacock, wrung out of narcissism, with his Mercedes, ring, position, dad, jeans, perfume, wad of bucks ?! <br><br>  <i>Read the rule again.</i> <br>  - Become who you can become. <br>  So are you able to become who you are today?  Or before death, finally, you will become what you want?  Or do you cherish yourself with a dream, with the hope that a miracle will happen: you win the lottery, a prince appears on a white horse, you are invited to take pictures in Hollywood, you suddenly become an expert, and so on?  NEVER!  Because, as there is another rule.  Which I will talk about later.  But here, what - never tease yourself with a stupid idea that you are smarter, more beautiful, kinder, that you deserve love, respect, money, good luck and the like.  Forget!  You do not deserve a fig!  You deserve only how much you worked on yourself.  And forget, for the sake of God, to let out the drooling of envy and snoting grumbling, from passing boys "major boys" throwing money on father and mother, forget reading matter about Berezovsky and Abramovich, Bill Geytts and your neighbor on black "boomer".  If after a year you remain the same bespontovy, and after two and five, then, litter - you have become what you could be!  What, do not like?  Then what the hell are you hitting up, and still have not become the best of your surroundings?  In the classroom, in the group, in the room, in the yard, at work, in the city?  Do you think your neighbor will strain and move your brains for you?  Do you remember that three billion people are your competitors?  Half a million in this city?  One hundred at the institute, ten at your job?  And you are a gray mouse, imperceptible.  Crush, pass and do not notice.  And this is all - who are you able to become?  Listen again - get up and go!  No one will go for you.  Or you are an insect in this life. <br><br><h5>  <b>Rule B. Soon it will be too late, you are almost too late!</b> </h5><br>  How old are you now?  Fifteen?  Twenty five?  Do you think you have time for the shaft?  You are no less mistaken than the idiot who thought that he would have time to quickly jump without a spacesuit from the Mir orbital station to the Shuttle in space!  He was ruptured by a vacuum, even though he could jump very quickly !!!  Why do you have very little time, now I will explain.  Suppose you are now 20 years old and you will retire (if you live) at 60 years old.  So you have 40 years?  (60 -20 = 40).  No, look further.  There are 365 days in a year, of which there are about 240 working days (not counting weekends, holidays, holidays). We multiply your remaining 40 years by 240 working days a year and get 9,600 working days before your pension.  (40 * 240 = 9600).  Think you have 9,600 business days?  No, look further.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">On the day, even if a very disciplined person you can not pay directly to work more than 6 hours a day. We get 57600 working hours before your pension (9600 * 6 = 57600). Think a lot? Do not count, start the countdown of your life. 24 hours a day. How many days of real work: 57600: 24 = 2400 net working days! And how many astronomical years it is: 2400: 365 = 6.57 years !!! My dear, you have only </font></font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">six and a half years of</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> pure work before retirement, and that is if you are only twenty !!! And in the clean 6 years of work, do you intend to become successful? And if you really develop yourself no more than two hours a day, then what will you do? TWO years with pennies !!!</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">By the way, I forgot to say, do you know what is the average life expectancy in this country? Less than retirement age! Subtract two, three, five years, which our statistics have added to calm the soul and order.</font></font> Hm<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">To live not until retirement, but that way up to 50 -55 years at best. Apart from the sudden death from heart attack, hypertension, lung cancer, stomach ulcers, moving a car, scrap on the skull at the entrance, cirrhosis of the liver and other misfortunes. Death is our companion always and everywhere. You can die this night, tomorrow afternoon, in an hour. No one knows when. And do not twitch in a fit of superstition. Sit quietly and read calmly. You will die and I will die. We will all die then. I do not scare you, I just want you to understand - every day, every hour should be filled with meaning and benefit. What with the fact that you bought yourself cool titanium wheels on a car, or a cool brandy vyzhlat, or cheerfully "hit" a harmful neighbor, or a traffic cop deceived, or ...</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If you have not done anything useful for your loved ones, or for others, or for your tomorrow, if it suddenly comes. What the hell is wasting days and hours when death is near? Here and look into your gut and do not be shy about your thoughts. What are you thinking about? Oh, fuck it all, if I am not, then don't give a shit about all, give myself up to all the sins of mortal ?! Yeah, cheerfully thought well done. Like 90% of assholes! Well, you probably forgot that you CAN be dying tomorrow, or maybe not tomorrow, but in 100 or 50 years!</font></font> In short.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">You shouldn't be nervous, don't worry. Just remember about death and do not fool yourself in a coffin, or what you will roll there - when there will be your family, relatives, colleagues and neighbors standing around - and what they will think about you (not to speak out loud, but to think!). </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Aloud: - Ah the poor thing died young, did not see life, etc. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">About myself (in the sense of you, but not out loud): - one more freak less! </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And in a year nobody will remember about you at all, except for mom and dad while watching a photo album. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And why the hell are you sky smoke here? What have you done good and good? Not for civilization and the world, but at least for their parents, brothers and sisters, friends, their environment, company, city?</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Listen, cry better now about your death and stop fearing death. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">She is still near as oxygen. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Just do </font></font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">not be late</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> ! </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Tomorrow may be too late!</font></font><br><br><h5> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Rule B. Nothing can be forever, only your bespontovost can be unchanged until his death!</font></font></b> </h5><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It doesn't matter what mood you are in now. It will change with you in a minute, hour, day, month, year. It doesn't matter what the weather is right now, just like your mood. No matter how many friends and grandmas you have in your pocket. It does not matter that you are angry, hungry, unhappy, devastated, exhausted, lost. However, after 50 years, 20, 5, or a year, or a week, the situation will change. And vice versa, you can now be energetic, happy, joyful, rich, healthy, the situation will change. Whatever "ass" you got, no matter what "hemorrhagus" experienced the last days, months, or years - REMEMBER: the situation will change! It is never always black or always white. Every fool knows this, but even the clever cannot understand it !!! Fall into obedku, depressed, hysterical, hang, ache, drink, break, die from fear and grief. THIS IS IDIOTS! Assholeswho react to the situation so drastically. And even more idiots are those who, having caught a fart while on a horse, behave like the last nits, the bastards snaked, to whom the luster of gold and the sound of their posts make them blind and deaf to ordinary people. They think they will always be cool, with power and wealth. And they are mistaken as stupidly as those who have lost hope.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Easy to say - remember this, hard to translate! </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">So, as soon as you feel the joy - go out into the streets of the poor and imagine that you are them. As soon as you feel that you are tired of living in grief - answer the question: what are you upset about? Remember the past? Fool, it's already gone, why the hell grieve about what is already gone? Worrying about tomorrow's future? A complete idiot - the future has not yet come, what to strain today from what is not there, except in your stupid head? Are you sick here and now? Right now, this second, this minute?</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Stop, say you're alive or dead? If you read or remember these lines, then you are ALIVE! So take a breath in relief - you're alive! Then, say, you have four limbs torn off, you are blind, deaf, dumb, you have a liver, spleen, lungs, heart? Your intestines don't work, the pancreas? Do you have broken ribs and spine? Do you, something physically hurt unbearably, terribly, unbearably?</font></font> NOT!<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If it hurts - call an ambulance! </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">So, you are alive and you have nothing to hurt. Nothing hurts. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">So why are you tense now, at the moment? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Stop whining, stop kayfovat - get up and go! </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Tomorrow everything will change !!! </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But this rule also says: the </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">world will change, the situation will change, but your grayness will remain! </font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It will remain until you start to clean and strain your brains and your body from hour to hour, day after day. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And as soon as you relax, the dullness, like a swamp, will suck you into the middle of mediocrity and cement you, just like your neighbor, your pread, that peasant at the bus stop, that aunt in the queue ... and you will also become cement-free bespontovy ... Therefore, stand up and go, swamp does not wait!</font></font><br><br><h5> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Rule G. Do not "throw" anyone, you should believe no less than the fact that gravity does not suddenly disappear.</font></font></b> </h5><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Say </font></font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">no</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> if you are not sure by less than 50% what you can, what you will do. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Say </font></font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">no</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> if you don‚Äôt do it, and you know that you don‚Äôt do more than 60%. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Saying </font></font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"yes"</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> , do it a week, a day, an hour earlier. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And it doesn‚Äôt matter to whom you tell your boss, son, colleague, homeless person, or yourself. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If you are not 50% sure or less sure that you can, what you will do, </font></font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">SAY ‚ÄúYES‚Äù, and do it three times more, two times faster. </font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Then you will have time to remake and plenty of options to choose the best. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Only then can you gain experience! </font></font><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">NEVER do the work ‚Äúexactly on time‚Äù</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> - this is how ‚Äútired mares‚Äù work. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Are you a tired mare?</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Remember, any job can be done 10 times faster than you do today! </font></font> How?<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Go and do it !!! </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Tired? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Go and do it! </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Run out of "batteries"? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Go and do it! </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Do not talk, do not look stupid. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Go and do it !!! </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">YOU CAN do any work three times faster and twice as much now, even without any exercises there! </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Just go and do it! </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Even if death stops you, and you gave someone a word, go and do it, your death will wait a couple of hours until you finish what you promised. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Try it and you will see! </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And if you are a Master, death can wait a year, you don‚Äôt throw it either - you promised to die in 127, so be kind, fulfill the promise!</font></font><br><br><h5> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Rule D. Are you gray or shit in the toilet?</font></font></b> </h5><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A turd in the toilet is not a drowning person, wherever you are, you always come up, and whoever touches you will not be happy. Well, you understand - you will not be lost anywhere! </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Cool to be a poop! All are afraid of you, do not touch, "respect" !!! So big, smelly. Tell me, do you know such people? Maybe a neighbor, a politician, a journalist? </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Grayness is an inconspicuous person, does not protrude, he does not need anything, his hut is always on the edge, he is only in the kitchen, in the darkness in a whisper is indignant about and for no reason. He doesn‚Äôt strive anywhere at all, but only rubs in his circle, but does nothing really good and for a long time.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Are you a gray turd? Very cheerful. That is not at all cheerful. But you have no other choice. If he was, then you would not read this book, in my opinion I have already told you that. So, you are a turd, gray or gray turd. And you do not want to be more like this, and other books did not help you, so you read this. And you get indignant. Do you know why you are angry? Because you poop! And if you silently read, it means gray! </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">What if you want to be different? Listen, have you finished reading these lines and have not changed and have not started anything yet? Perhaps nothing will help you. Except how to read the book first and kick yourself three times.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Get up and go before it dries !!! </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And never stop again !!! </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Stop - your death as a person, your brain will be covered with mold and fungi, the muscles will atrophy and you will start to stink. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Run faster, with acceleration, through force, I can not. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">You do not have much to run - just two years! </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Escape from this one-dimensional stagnation of narrow-mindedness and wiping your pants on the pope, get up and run!</font></font><br><br><h5> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Rule E. Stop being an appendage!</font></font></b> </h5><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Disable ICT tools (ICQ, e-mail, mobile phone, favorite pager and all this kind of active life), cut down the radio, tivi, blind the windows, remove everything from the table, finally become a person, not an interface between all these personalities, slave to iron and software. You are an accessory to all these lotions, for you are useless without them! Already you can‚Äôt do without background music, you‚Äôre spinning and collapsing, if you don‚Äôt check your email, don‚Äôt you see who sent you an instant message flasher? You can not resist, so as not to see - who did it go through the window, what a sharp goat braked you, what did you pass - the ambulance or the police? What kind of idiots scream, crowd? Listen - you are an idiot, not they! They do at least something, and you, as an infusorium, react to everything. So you will react until you are cremated or buried and are not written on the tombstone "he was an amoeba,ameba and died. " Stop watching the news on the Internet, on TV, stop reading newspapers and magazines. Do not you understand that they are designed for morons like you? Why are you going to devour any garbage - and what about Filia and Allka, and what about Yukos, and what about Jews and Palestinians, what has burst, exploded, flew up, chuhnulo and so on. Do you need it? You, didn‚Äôt you understand that you are infonarcot at the infoderme? What will change from what you read, rewrite, hear enough and see enough?Do not you understand that you - infonarcot at infoderme? What will change from what you read, rewrite, hear enough and see enough?Do not you understand that you - infonarcot at infoderme? What will change from what you read, rewrite, hear enough and see enough?</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">You just as one of the thousands, millions of mediocrities, will raise the rating of the site, the media, zahlam your web-covered skull and tense up, and then you go gab with you like and discuss this garbage. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Remember - the media is designed to make money on assholes, and you goof! </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And they will stay. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If you just as stupidly waste time, which you almost do not have!</font></font><br><br><h5> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Rule G.

Look at yourself - how much you do to get away from something, how you explain your actions - because! </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">You live in a four dimensional space, if you consider the time. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The movement from and because - is meaningless, this is avoidance, and not development at all. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This simple and short rule can drastically change you. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It sets the direction where and to which you should come.</font></font><br><br><h5> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Rule Z.
