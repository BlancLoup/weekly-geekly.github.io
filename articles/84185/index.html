About how I used the "sniper", I used an intermediary and about what problems arose.  I have been making purchases from abroad for more than half a year and there were no particular problems in finding what I needed. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/120/719/b79/120719b79698b33601fc5d5ca1993a41.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I wanted myself the latest generation iPod and maybe a little used. <br>  Having studied the market, I came to these prices: <br><ul><li>  Amazon.com price was <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Apple-touch-Generation-NEWEST-MODEL/dp/B002M3SOC4/ref%3Dsr_1_1%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Delectronics%26qid%3D1258140389%26sr%3D8-1">$ 270</a> ; </li><li>  ebay.com auction new from $ 250, used and <a href="http://www.vxzone.com/refurbished.htm">Refurbished</a> from $ 220 </li><li>  In Moscow from 11500 p. </li></ul><br>  <i>* prices at the beginning of January 2010</i> <br>  Moreover, Refurbished player may be such that it will look like a new one, let's say it was bought and handed over to the store the next day. <br>  In general, on ebay the price range is large and it is better to participate in auctions, because  You can tear off a new player for a good price.  Most of the sellers are sent only in the USA, but if you do not want to use an intermediary, you can search for sellers who send them all over the world.  There are few such sellers, but they are there, and prices at auction sometimes turn out to be higher.  I watched such lots and in some cases it turns out cheaper than using a middleman. <br><br><h4>  Sniper </h4><br>  Sniper - this is a service that in the last seconds of the end of the auction makes a bid above the latter.  And you put a limit on how much you are willing to pay for this lot.  For example, a sniper must buy a lot, you have registered that you are ready to give a maximum of $ 100 for this lot.  In the last seconds, someone bets $ 70, a sniper if he has time, puts $ 70.50 and you win, here is an approximate principle of work. <br>  I used <a href="http://www.myibay.com/">myibay</a> , a fairly convenient sniper, has an add-on for Firefox, a separate application, or everything can be done via the web.  The program is paid, but given 30 days trial.  I'll tell you by example.  I selected the individual lots that I liked and added them to the group.  The limit on the won lots put "1", i.e.  after the sniper wins the lot, he will stop betting.  The main thing is not to hurry and check all the lots that you add.  It may happen that a broken lot is sold or a model at all.  Most auctions end at night, at this time in the USA day.  So I put the sniper and went to sleep.  In the morning the sniper delighted me that I won the lot for <a href="">$ 222.50</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9f7/678/65f/9f767865fddcfc9d0fc3d3793a30ce61.png" alt="image">

      After seeing how the other auctions ended, I realized that I was lucky and I bought the cheapest of all.  The next stage is payment and delivery. <br><br><h4>  Mediator </h4><br>  The seller sends the lot only in the USA and I needed a mediator who would teach the package and then send it to me.  The most proven intermediary in the market is <a href="http://www.shipito.com/">Shipito</a> .  I found the excellent Shipito FAQ <a href="http://shophelp.ru/forum/showthread.php%3Ft%3D6907">here</a> .  They have different rates and if you often use their services, you can pick up advantageous subscriptions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/499/dbd/e60/499dbde60b0f35f9732ec338e594bb3c.png" alt="image"><br><br>  I chose the first and registered.  I paid $ 8.50 and they gave me an address in Torrance, California.  Accordingly, there is their warehouse and the entire company, each client receives an address and a box.  This address is specified as the main one on ebay and you pay for the winning lot.  In my case, the parcel from one coast to another came in just a <a href="http://trkcnfrm1.smi.usps.com/PTSInternetWeb/InterLabelInquiry.do%3ForigTrackNum%3D9101150134711024480752">couple of days</a> .  I was very surprised at how the US mail works, our mail delivers a package to a neighboring city for several weeks, and then everything takes 2 days.  Shipito wrote to the post office that something had come to my cell.  In the small photo you cannot even distinguish what it is, but all the dimensions and weight are written.  Now you need to fill out a declaration and select the type of delivery.  I chose the most expensive delivery of ‚ÄúUSPS Express Mail¬Æ Int'l‚Äù because I wanted to get the package quickly.  Having paid for the delivery, the intermediary sent my package and gave me a tracking. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/836/bf9/6e7/836bf96e750adc597bbb8f379d343082.png" alt="image"><br><br>  As you can see from tracking, as always, everything is fast in the US, while in Russia the package is stuck.  On February 6, after the status of "Sort" appeared, I called EMS and asked what was happening with my package.  The girl replied that the package on delivery, wait for the courier.  Having been delighted, I spent the whole house waiting for the courier, but no one arrived ... They wrote ‚ÄúNot handing‚Äù on the site.  Once again calling EMS I was told that the courier did not have time, wait for tomorrow.  I did not accept such a disposition and I said that I would take the parcel myself.  My package was forwarded to the issuing department at Vernadsky and was told to call the next day in the morning.  I call in the morning, specifying whether it is possible to come pick up, having received a positive answer, I drove off.  I come there I see a typical scoop, the girl says: <br>  - Oh, we have not yet disassembled the bags, can not find.  Wait a bit. <br>  Mentally obmativiv the entire postal system of Russia, I sit down on a bench with a girl who also came to receive the parcel.  She also learned everything in advance, and told her to call the issuing department and clarify.  In general, after half an hour we were called. <br>  They show me my package, I take it in my hands and I feel a shiver in my legs ... It was a paper bag, not a box, a bag!  I immediately sensed that something was amiss, after examining the package and not seeing any signs of an autopsy, I signed that I agreed with everything.  Inside there was another paper bag with a player (the shipito does not open the parcels) wrapped in wrapping paper with pimples. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6aa/5e3/d64/6aa5e3d64a5e8e2c2accf77fb46f79cd.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The seller indicated that the lot does not have the original box, but at least he could have shoved it in the cardboard box, this package could be distributed, crushed, pressed, and stepped on.  Although the seller sent it across the USA, maybe the mail can take care of the parcels there, not as we throw bags with the parcels.  The player was wrapped in cling film, as new in front, micro-scratches typical of iPod's back.  Carefully inspecting the lid, I ran my hand and felt that the lid has a small dent ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4b3/add/8dc/4b3add8dc05ea4c0fc506fc073496345.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Refund </h4><br>  Dents in the amount of 2 pieces are not so terrible and almost not noticed, the more I was going to wear the player in the <a href="http://www.dealextreme.com/details.dx/sku.25421">case</a> , but still unpleasant.  I wrote about this to the seller, he answered only after 24 hours and asked for a photo.  Again wrote to him, again he answers for a long time.  I got sick of it and I opened a dispute in PayPal.  This can be done through the payment history in PayPal, you specify the reason for the dispute and begins communication with the seller.  The seller immediately began to answer my questions.  Having provided him with photos and <a href="http://vimeo.com/9326153">videos</a> , we agreed on a partial refund.  Initially, he offered to return the player to him and he will refund all the money, but I said that I would be satisfied with a small compensation and I will close the dispute.  The maximum that he could give was $ 20, explaining that he could no longer, since it would be disadvantageous to him.  I agreed and told him to refund.  Most of the answers he wrote to me through ebay, and not through PayPal.  I receive a letter through ebay, they say, close the dispute, only then I will make a refund.  I felt that something was wrong, because  I read about refunds and knew that if the seller returns the money the dispute closes.  After telling him about this, he hesitated and said that he would try or call the PayPal manager in the morning.  Perhaps this is the seller‚Äôs inexperience, if he set me up, then I would leave him a negative feedback or complain to PayPal.  A few minutes later a letter arrived from PayPal, I received $ 20, I agreed to accept the money and the dispute was automatically closed. <br><br>  For myself, I concluded that the next time if I ordered something fragile, I would definitely remind the seller about the box.  I am even a little glad that this happened, because I had more experience and in the future I will do better. <br><br><ul><li>  Apple iPod touch 3rd 32Gb <b>$ 220.5</b> </li><li>  Mediator <b>$ 8.5</b> </li><li>  Shipping <b>$ 31.99</b> </li><li>  Refund <b>- $ 20</b> </li></ul><br>  <i><b>Total $ 240.99 or 7268 p.</b></i> <br><br>  The experience gained is priceless! <br><br>  Have a nice shopping! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/84185/">https://habr.com/ru/post/84185/</a></p>
