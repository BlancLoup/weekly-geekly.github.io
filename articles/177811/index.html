Yes, this is a common practice in the US, when a subscriber receives a phone for a symbolic, in fact, price when concluding a contract for cellular services. <br><br>  The Big Three released almost identical Android smartphones priced below $ 100 made in China.  These are <b>MTS 960</b> (2990 rubles), <b>Beeline E600</b> (2990 rubles) and <b>MegaFon Login</b> (2560 rubles) <br>  I have in my hands the last one - <b>MegaFon Login</b> on Android 4.0.4. <br><br>  <i>In addition to the phone itself, for these 2560 rubles, the subscriber receives three months of work on the Internet at the ‚ÄúInternet XS‚Äù tariff.</i>  <i>That is, in fact, the phone itself will cost 1990 rubles.</i>  <i>Without a contract, the price of a smartphone is 2990 rubles.</i>

      The device features are as follows: <br><br><img align="right" src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/578/e2b/629/578e2b6294030a26d76509db1789f019.jpg"><ul><li>  Support GSM, 3G, GPRS, EDGE, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, GPS, A-GPS, GLONASS </li><li>  Broadcom BCM21654, 1 GHz processor </li><li>  RAM 512 MB </li><li>  4 GB internal memory </li><li>  VideoCore IV HW Video Accelerator </li><li>  Capacitive screen 320 √ó 480, 3.5 ", multitouch on 2 touches </li><li>  <nobr>Li-ion battery,</nobr> 1300 mAh </li><li>  3 megapixel camera, with flash </li><li>  Support for microSD cards up to 32 GB </li><li>  FM radio with RDS </li><li>  MicroUSB and 3.5mm headphone jacks </li><li>  Size 63 √ó 115.8 √ó 13 mm, weight 118 g </li></ul><br>  Only half a year ago I wrote on Habr√© about the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/155775/">MegaFon SP-W1</a> smartphone with almost identical characteristics and the price of 8900 rubles. <br><br>  It became interesting to me - what had to be done with the gadget so that it would drop by 4 times without changing the characteristics, and does it make sense to buy it for such a price?  Looking ahead to say that I liked this toy.  Login is definitely worth the price, and Android helps him a lot. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Completing the smartphone is traditionally simple and predictable.  This is a rechargeable battery and a USB cord with a charger.  In addition to them, a miniature box revealed a manual and a wired headset (does anyone print them out at all?). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a6c/567/433/a6c567433d654991726ceba121afedb3.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ef2/f0a/25a/ef2f0a25a7d39310f1de23d03756a2a1.jpg"><br><br>  The charger produces 0.5 A, which in modern times seems to be like a bit.  The battery is also small - 1300 mAh.  However, the current consumption in this smartphone is low - the battery is enough for a couple of days of active use. <br><br>  If in numbers, it is about 9 hours of conversation, 8 hours of watching movies or 125 hours in standby mode. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d92/62a/769/d9262a769ec61a3d9a166a705cab03cc.jpg"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1c6/01c/c77/1c601cc778ea6b3982eac3038a225fb5.jpg"></a> <br><br>  MegaFon Login looks like a modern rather stylish smartphone.  The size is very well chosen - it fits into the shirt pocket and does not interfere with jeans or breaks.  It is comfortable in the hand <i>(the back panel is with SoftTouch coating)</i> .  For example, Nokia Asha 200 has a similar size (in the photo). <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d0e/016/fd5/d0e016fd534c26e5e41b63bb1acea7ec.jpg"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d90/066/98a/d9006698a2aaf1ca2f6bdb75a160a4e7.jpg"></a> <br><br>  I must say that I took the phone a week ago, and all week I mercilessly exploited it in physically extreme conditions.  I did not manage to damage it in any way - it was assembled very reliably, and in itself is quite durable. <br><br>  In terms of assembly, I have only one complaint <i>(the same was true for SP-W1, by the way)</i> : the microUSB connector is not protected by anything.  And I'm almost sure that I can put the wire in there wrong and break something there. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ed8/d6c/06f/ed8d6c06f46f378234849b86f845801e.jpg"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/623/10a/ca7/62310aca7e21811e7c2340bca2744cbc.jpg"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d9b/fe6/2ea/d9bfe62ea287b046293bc868484976a9.jpg"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1c0/f19/95d/1c0f1995ddf84347b37a9ed0d34eb136.jpg"></a> <br><br>  In addition to the microUSB on the left side of the phone there is nothing more.  At the top - a headphone jack and on / off button.  On the right - the volume rocker, the bottom - the microphone and the hardware button "Home".  She is not too needed, but it is more convenient for her to turn on the smartphone screen than with the button on the top. <br><br>  On the back of the device is a camera (3 megapixels) with LED flash.  The camera does not have autofocus, which significantly affects the quality of images.  It can record quite tolerable video in 640 √ó 480 resolution.  The flash can be used as a flashlight, and this is its best use. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5b2/775/cc6/5b2775cc64a8b019781f93e5a8d1328c.jpg"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/47a/56b/ec3/47a56bec3756a38199e0ee37fcb8d25b.jpg"></a> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/959/630/42c/95963042cdefc2d39524bee86152d7fe.jpg"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9fd/20a/169/9fd20a169db35f7d213b909a18d60308.jpg"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9d0/c43/d84/9d0c43d841a2ce8f6dcb92b5c5c1bebf.jpg"></a> <br><br>  Photographing a text with such a camera is quite realistic; in the photo it can be read. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/153/bf4/1a1/153bf41a129f12ae1a61bac9ab550feb.jpg"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/65b/175/796/65b175796ffb6cd36cd269aff00d1edb.jpg"></a> <br><br>  The external speaker on the phone is normal, the melodies are loud enough.  In headphones, the sound is of higher quality, if you acquire normal headphones, of course. <br><br>  The screen at MegaFon Login is definitely not the strongest place.  The manufacturer saved it on him.  Not too high brightness, small viewing angles, low sensitivity and accuracy.  You need to get used to it <i>(in a week I learned to type the text almost without missing)</i> , and this smartphone is contraindicated for those who are annoyed with such things. <br><br>  Part of the problem with typing is solved by installing alternative on-screen keyboards and display calibration. <br><br>  The strength of the smartphone is geolocation.  There is also a very smart GPS, and A-GPS, and even GLONASS, which is a great rarity for devices in this price range.  And it all works. <br><br>  Being connected to the vehicle‚Äôs on-board network, the MegaFon Login turns into a navigator.  All popular navigation systems and maps are installed on it without problems and work fine.  As I understand it, MegaFon does not even take money for traffic in the preinstalled ‚ÄúNavigation‚Äù program. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/de4/1b3/f39/de41b3f395616ef07c001fb48f8a2b24.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/aff/285/e58/aff285e58231142aa63acc61e3f52d5d.png"><br><br>  Like the SP-W1, Login only works with MegaFon SIM cards.  You can buy and "untied", but a little more expensive and the order (have to wait). <br><br>  It keeps good communication, both in Wi-Fi networks, in 3G, and in areas with weak coverage. <br><br>  According to the manual, the 3G module works in the HSDPA 7.2 Mbit / s format - download, HSUPA 5.76 Mbit / s - recoil.  The possibility of such speeds depends on the number of base stations nearby.  I was not able to fix the download speed of more than 4 Mbps - the smartphone works with 3G at the same speed as the first-generation iPad.  I think in large cities the speed should be higher. <br><br>  It is possible to choose which network to use - 2G or 3G.  There are functions of Bluetooth-modem and Wi-Fi router, which significantly expands the possibilities of using the device. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e1a/d89/412/e1ad894120a5b96a15d8b7a72dbcf297.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e44/061/940/e44061940eb32b2ff7546a47317179aa.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/408/4de/4fa/4084de4fadaca5b89e53d98e515dd746.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/92c/fe0/f11/92cfe0f115dc57853776f939fd6d3ced.png"><br><br>  The software of the smartphone has not undergone any special changes - apart from Android 4.0.4 ICS itself, the smartphone contains a set of programs from Mail.ru, Navigator and Replace Hooter from MegaFon, as well as a certain sports application ‚ÄúChampionship.com‚Äù. <br><br>  Almost all the programs that I tried to run on this smartphone, worked without any problems.  Exceptions are Skype and Chrome - official applications from the Play Market do not work, you need to install other versions (there are online).  Only Instagram doesn't work at all - the patch is not released yet. <br><br>  Games work, various racing simulators and shooters (Dead Trigger, for example) work without complaints, not to mention all kinds of Angry Birds. <br><br>  No obvious glitches and freezes were noticed - the device works quickly, clearly and predictably.  In my opinion, this is exactly what saves the smartphone - Android is completely honest on it and the vast majority of applications from the Play Market. <br><br>  And for some of the complexity of Android from the point of view of beginners are its opportunities.  Completely trivial tasks like ‚Äúthrowing a film on the phone and see‚Äù or ‚Äútake a picture and send it to e-mail‚Äù are solved on such a device extremely simply and in a matter of seconds. <br><br>  I think children will also be delighted with such phones (games, applications, appearance), and the parents' wallet will suffer less if the phone is lost or broken by a child.  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/140172/">AndroidLost</a> on it, by the way, works great. <br><br>  Anyway, the Internet, a 3G router, a GPS navigator, a camera and an audio-video player for such money are a good suggestion.  I decided to keep this phone after the review. <br><br>  I hope this line of cheap devices with high functionality <i>(albeit to the detriment of the manufacturability of some components)</i> will create a positive trend and will be in demand from "their" consumer.  I think I even got to this target audience - I really do not know what to do on a smartphone for 8900, which does not work on it.  And the price of MegaFon Login seems to me more than justified. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/177811/">https://habr.com/ru/post/177811/</a></p>
