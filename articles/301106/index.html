      And in general, already mashed templates will come to mind to many: <br><ul><li>  It is necessary not to envy, but to work more, and you will become the same highly paid top manager. </li><li>  I do not like it - go away and work for yourself / outsource the currency to Western companies / move to other countries. </li></ul><br><br>  But these conclusions and tips too lie on the surface. <br>  We need to go deeper. <br>  Let's see how deep this <u>non-rabbit</u> hole is ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Table of contents </h2><br><ol><li>  Crisis is not for everyone </li><li>  Such a different top management </li><li>  Deformation of the personality and deformation of the company </li><li>  Yandex as a potential media company </li><li>  IT reaction </li><li>  Why big companies are needed, and who are not able to manage them </li><li>  Slaveholders at the helm </li><li>  How to build non-slave relations in the Company </li><li>  Yes, what else is the law </li><li>  Everything is under control </li><li>  Audit also paid for? </li><li>  In plain language </li><li>  Money-money is rubbish </li><li>  Investment unattractiveness </li><li>  findings </li><li>  Polls </li><li>  What was it?  What to expect next? </li></ol><br><h2>  1. The crisis is not for everyone </h2><br><br>  Based on the generally accepted number of subordinates at the head n = 4..10 people, the 5-level structure from fig.  1 corresponds to the size of the enterprise n ^ 4 - i.e.  from 250 to 1000 people. <br>  In addition, this company may be a branch of a company whose head office is built according to the same structure.  Then the total number of staff of the Company is growing multiple of the number of branches. <br>  According to the HH classification for Russia, these are large companies (the last 2 lines of the table): <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8b9/4c1/194/8b94c11945624041a890e7db8dfe276a.gif"><br><br>  Large Russian companies report that they felt excellent in 2015, better than in 2014. <br>  However, they did not compensate for the inflation of ordinary employees and line management.  Real incomes of employees fell. <br>  HH comments it like this: <br><blockquote>  On average, since the beginning of the year, the salary for all positions has fallen by 1%. <br>  ... for the year, the highest growth is shown by the ‚Äútop‚Äù, leading positions.  These are the people on whom the business results and strategy of the organization directly depend; therefore, it is important to continue to motivate them.  These employees in the company are a minority, and a 20% salary increase for managers usually has little effect on the average wage figure. </blockquote><br><br>  "Usually almost no effect," well, I must.  Just think, an additional 3.5% could all be raised.  Well, unless employees need these 3.5% - it is better to give the top management, they lack the most. <br><br>  Ugh, what a soft and wet tongue HH "licked." <br>  Let's go after them sandpaper ... <br><br>  The top management had very high incomes before the crisis, but they decided to write down a salary increase exceeding inflation. <br>  The decision of the top management separated them from the team of the company into a special group.  This is not a trivial dividing sign, but the most important and critical one, since  a person perceives a very painful decrease in his income (the same HH will confirm to you). <br>  If you look at real income, adjusted for inflation, the picture will be quite clear: <br><br>  <strong>Top management wrote out a salary increase by lowering the incomes of the rest of the team.</strong> <br><br>  The data of HH objectively shows that all the <a href="http://slobodin.livejournal.com/165176.html">stories of the top management about the ‚Äúcrisis and new reality‚Äù</a> are a variation of the <a href="http://www.anekdot.ru/id/-411500002/">anecdote</a> ‚ÄúDad, you have raised the price of vodka, now you will drink less!  ‚ÄúNo, son, you'll eat less!‚Äù <br>  Just a manipulative psychological treatment of ordinary employees for the operation under the code name "tightening the belts." <br>  There are simply no economic and legal prerequisites, as we will see later. <br><h2>  2. Such a different top management </h2><br><blockquote>  "The <a href="https://slon.ru/posts/65347">head of the Russian Post has criticized a proposal to limit the salaries of top managers of state-owned companies ...</a> <br>  The head of ‚ÄúMail‚Äù added that the proposal to establish an eightfold limit on the salary of managers in relation to the average salary of an employee does not cause him ‚Äúnothing but a smile‚Äù. <br><br>  " <a href="http://www.forbes.ru/news/312425-ogranichenie-zarplat-top-menedzherov-ne-voshlo-v-antikrizisnyi-plan">Proposals to limit the salaries of top managers of state-owned companies and abandon luxury cars for officials</a> <br>  were not included in the anti-crisis plan that the Ministry of Economic Development submitted to the government, reports Prime Agency on Tuesday, February 9. " </blockquote><br><br>  Well, and so on. <br>  I combed the Internet, and you know, all the examples of devil-may-care attitude to the team in the overwhelming majority of cases relate to large companies, moreover, enjoying state support in one form or another.  Those.  having "non-market" guarantees of their existence. <br><br>  But there is another top management. <br><blockquote>  Volozh could easily throw off the "Arcadia" as an unnecessary burden.  It would be an act according to all the rules of the era: let the strongest survive.  But he not only did not close the unprofitable company, but on the contrary - he raised wages for the employees, hired another person, moved everyone to a new office on Gubkin Street and launched the Digital Bible project. <br>  ... <br>  ‚ÄúThere were about five silent programmers sitting in old, stretched sweaters, gloomy, but very clever, ... <br>  I asked Arkasha: ‚ÄúListen, we pay them $ 300 a month, which is expensive, but what do they do?‚Äù And he answered: ‚ÄúRobert, do not worry.  Something good will definitely come out of this office. ‚Äù </blockquote><br><br>  The fall in company revenues is a crisis.  The global practice is that a top manager who saves his company from a crisis goes <a href="https://vc.ru/p/dollar-club">to work for a symbolic $ 1</a> .  Top management receives an increase in salary, and a premium from what remains after the compensation of income of ordinary employees.  A different approach has a destructive effect on the ‚Äúinternal environment of the Company‚Äù. <br><h2>  3. Deformation of the personality and deformation of the company </h2><br><br>  <font><i>And who is not able to rule</i></font> <font><i><br></i></font>  <font><i>He wants to rule over the neighbors.</i></font> <font><br></font>  <font>Goethe, "Faust"</font> <font><br></font> <br><br>  The man is designed so that he must prove to himself why he has the right to what he did to silence the voice of his conscience.  Dostoevsky remember the school curriculum?  Internal dialogues, that everything around the creature is trembling, but does He have them by right? <br><br>  In terms of IT, the little man patches the software of his brain.  The patch contains near-Gnostic theories, according to which all people are different, and now he is born to rule the rest.  He is a wolf, and all of you are sheep, He is a passionary man, and you are fuckers.  He has more natural needs, and you are a lazy, but unpretentious people who love vodka and whip.  And other nonsense. <br><br>  A person is looking for confirmation of his beliefs, the correctness of the work of his patched brain.  Therefore, <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/295314/">from downstream in the hierarchy, he gladly receives a positive response</a> , confirming that the people love his firm hand, his, hmm, transformations. <br>  In some aspects this patch necessarily contradicts the observed reality.  The patched brain avoids contradictions by ignoring facts that are unpleasant for it and does not make conclusions that are unpleasant for themselves ( <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259A%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B5_%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B6%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5">Cognitive distortions</a> , <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A1%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BA_%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D1%2585_%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B6%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9">List of cognitive distortions</a> ) <br><br>  In order not to hear criticism, which calls into question the precious patch and threatens to return the psychological discomfort, the head disconnects the feedback systems in the company - risk management and internal audit.  Censorship is introduced for discussions between employees on internal corporate portals. <br>  The company as a system from this loses stability and controllability. <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Here, for example, in Beeline ...</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  The CEO is a member of the board of directors (well, at least not the chairman), and the <a href="http://static.beeline.ru/upload/contents/297/Annual_Report_2014_final_rus.doc">internal audit is subordinate to him, and not to the board of directors</a> . <br><br>  Information (report) on compliance by VimpelCom with the principles and recommendations of the Corporate Governance Code recommended for use by the Bank of Russia: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0b2/349/b4f/0b2349b4fdcd47dd9a48bc9ede06d667.gif"><br><br>  I will explain the chip.  A board of directors is being created to look after whether the CEO does not ‚Äúenter‚Äù.  Internal audit should inform the Board of Directors of the situation analysis, analysis of problems in the company. <br></div></div><br><br>  From such positioning and such behavior of the top management, the system of non-material motivation swells. <br><blockquote>  <a href="https://medium.com/%40allo/%25D0%25BE-%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B9-%25D0%25B8-%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B9-%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BE%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B8-53a94dced2d0">With pure ‚Äúperfect‚Äù motivation, you need to be careful</a> .  The trick is that it works only if it is absolutely, perfectly sincere ... </blockquote><br><br>  As for the material motivation, the question remains - how much will the real s / n be reduced by under-compensating the magnitude of inflation. <br><br>  <strong>There will be no gingerbread, the only question is how long and thick the whip will be.</strong> <br><br>  It turns out that from the management tools these top managers have left only financial blackmail. <br>  Greed, stupidity, betrayal of the interests of the collective - as it is ... unlike the actions of competent managers. <br><br>  But is it possible that such selectivity is when the attitude to the subordinate collective is one, to the competitors the second, and to the customers - the third? <br>  <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A3%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD,_%25D0%25A1%25D1%258D%25D0%25BC">Sam Walton</a> says no: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c9b/428/eef/c9b428eef2d34b55af580e8a3556c1b1.jpg"><br><br><blockquote>  It takes no more than a week or two, and employees begin to treat customers in the same way as a company treats its employees. </blockquote><br><br>  Supplement Uncle Sam.  ‚ÄúSimilarly,‚Äù this is not how the general director is concerned, but often worse, because  the negative part of the "relationship" is amplified when passing down the <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/295314/">vertical of corporate power</a> . <br><br>  The like attracts and develops the like - a bad manager decomposes his subordinates. <br>  Robbing employees, he incites them to similar actions to the company and to customers.  That the database with personal data is stolen, it will <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/267447/">help stealing money from Sberbank clients</a> . <br>  There is a deformation of personalities, deformation of the organization, loss of efficiency. <br><br>  So, citizens, what are we complaining about?  To the Post of Russia?  On banks?  On operators? <br><h2>  4. Yandex as a media company </h2><br><br>  I‚Äôll quote Yandex.Book again. <br><blockquote>  <a href="http://www.forbes.ru/kompanii/internet-telekom-i-media/259181-yandeks-kniga-kak-vlast-vpervye-zainteresovalas-poiskovikom">How the authorities first became interested in the search engine</a> (required reading). <br>  - First, through newspapers, and then in private conversations, they made it clear to us that our company is good, but the shareholders are wrong.  Say, such a serious and strategically important company should belong to others <br>  ... <br>  ‚ÄúOf course, it was not about raiding,‚Äù continues Leonid Boguslavsky.  - The offer was a market one - moreover, the money that was given for this business far exceeded its real value. <br>  But these people did not understand one simple thing, which was as follows: ‚ÄúYandex‚Äù is the company that grew and continues to grow solely due to the internal culture of relationships.  This is not the case when today you can steer like that, but tomorrow is different.  If this environment is destroyed, this business will simply die, and everyone will lose. <br>  ... <br>  Doubt that the "friendly investor" will bring discord and will try to steer the company in a completely different cultural traditions, not left after the first meeting.  On it, in particular, potential owners voiced some disagreements with the current management style of ‚ÄúYandex‚Äù.  Offering a good price for a block of shares, they immediately put forward a number of conditions. <br>  ‚ÄúFor example, we were given to understand that we will have to put a barrier on issuing new options,‚Äù says Elena Ivashentseva.  - They said so: ‚ÄúWhy do you give people options?  Do not give people options.  After all, they already receive a salary. ‚Äù <br>  ... <br>  Why should I share property with a person who already has to serve you faithfully and truly - you pay him money.  If you follow the logic of such slave management, $ 120 millionaires, which appeared as a result of the release of Yandex to the IPO, is a direct loss to the company.  But the question is: does real success come to someone who does not know how to share them? </blockquote><br><br>  By the way, there is one wonderful case in my collection, when, despite all the efforts, and even the launch under the ‚Äúnationalization of losses and privatization of income‚Äù scheme, the project did not take off from the slave owners.  Well, maybe it flies, but it's sooo short.  From the side it seems that creeps. <br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúWe asked:‚Äú And what do you need? ‚Äù, Reproduces the approximate thread of the conversation Arkady Volozh.  - They answer: well, you see, this resource can be used as a media. <br>  We now know you, you will not do this.  And if someone buys you, some Murdoch or someone else?  After all, by law, anyone can buy you. <br>  The outlines of the task began to clear up.  It was to provide the government with a degree of control over Yandex, which would allow it to intervene only in case of a change of ownership that is unacceptable for the national interests.  But this tool was not supposed to give the ‚Äúsovereign people‚Äù the rights to the current management of the company. </blockquote><br><br>  If they then sold their shares, then immediately in the top management would be trusted people of the new shareholders, and <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/297678/">this holiday would start</a> , right on all counts. <br>  The former employees would work at Yandex-1, but Yandex-2 would have appeared - the incoming top management + advisers and consultants invited by them. <br>  <em>(The attentive reader will ask the question how can the use of western consulting be combined with concern for the country's media security. Let us return to this question in a separate article.)</em> <br>  I-1 would work contrary to the idiocy of I-2 management decisions.  I-2 would have parasitized I-1, taking revenues and assets abroad into reliable funds under the flag of cost optimization. <br><br>  The principle is not to give a share in a company to employees, this is a direct message to employees - this is not your company, we are the owners here, and you are slaves. <br>  A self-respecting expert from I-1 would not be able to go to I-2 - other skills are needed there, and I wouldn't take anyone to I-2, we must first prove ... no, not professional aptitude, but personal loyalty (" <a href="http://slobodin.livejournal.com/142094.html">Not create trouble for those you work for</a> ").  Therefore, there can be no specialists from I-1 in I-2 - there is another specialization. <br><br>  Arkady Volozh also could not work among the new top management.  Well, what could be the work in a situation ‚Äúbuilt a house, planted a tree, raised a son‚Äù, and then sold it all for good money, and now the house has been made e ... a hotel, the tree was cut down for firewood, and the son became a farm laborer at the new owners. <br><br>  The creators of Yandex are great fellows, who were able to avoid the emergence of new top management.  At the same time, they recognized the ‚Äúsmall evil‚Äù as inevitable and permissible - the appearance of levers of influence from the political leadership and the supervision of the special services.  <em>(However, they have been inside Yandex for all the years - you can read about their methods in Yandex.Book. Very mental people, from the word "strangle".) The excesses with Kinopoisk, which contradicts the internal culture of the former Yandex, give out the influence of the carriers of a foreign internal culture, with specific ideas about</em> <del>  <em>betrayal</em> </del>  <em>disloyalty to management.</em>  <em>Given that the real situation is strictly the opposite - if Yandex‚Äôs publicly lumped project managers are publicly criticized by Yandex employees, then for Yandex consumers, this is evidence that Yandex is alive - there are still caring people in it who are struggling with marasmic processes.</em> <br><blockquote>  <a href="https://www.vedomosti.ru/newspaper/articles/2008/12/23/ya-schitayu-yandex-strategicheskoj-kompaniej---arkadij-volozh-generalnyj-direktor-yandexa">We have two types of shares - with ordinary votes and with a ‚Äústrengthened‚Äù voting right (10 votes per share).</a>  According to the company's charter, when selling shares with a ‚Äústrengthened‚Äù right to vote, they are automatically converted into preferred shares with an ordinary voice (such shares would be placed on the stock exchange).  The current shareholders have ‚Äúsuper-voting‚Äù shares. <br>  - What was it done for? <br>  - This structure is typical for companies in which business is 90% dependent on the creative team, where, like us, people are the main asset of the company.  For us, the main examples were companies operating in the same field as us.  The same corporate governance is with Google in America and Baidu in China.  This guarantees companies some protection from an ‚Äúunqualified‚Äù investor. </blockquote><br><br>  Here's how to use typical patterns. <del>  plundering </del>  company management, if its employees are shareholders?  It is easy for external shareholders to hang noodles on their ears, manipulating reporting.  Employees from the inside see everything, you make to them about cost cutting, and they: ‚ÄúFrom your reduction, revenue fell, and in fact costs only increased under another article.‚Äù  Here's how to push them around, how to intimidate?  Yes, they themselves will tell you - it is not we who have you, these you have an employee.  You are a shitty manager, we vote with our super-voting shares - go away. <br><br>  And what happens?  One trusted little man will be sent out, with corrupted karma, then another ... The next representative of the golden youth will no longer want to go there. <br><br>  It was difficult for Yandex to inculcate the company's culture in new employees ... Happy!  They did not work in the opposite situation - when a new top management arrives with its own culture, more precisely lack of culture and total illiteracy.  When it would be better to dismiss the top management in general, and the efficiency of the company would only increase - the team of employees would not have to fight with the idiocy of the instructions of the authorities, to transform them into something acceptable. <br><br>  For example, how would the Yandex employees feel if the incoming top management demanded to bring all the servers to one data center?  The official basis for the launch of the ‚ÄúOne Search‚Äù project: cost reduction + time-to-market reduction when new features are rolled into the search software.  Of course, in the course of the process it turns out that the investment in the project is such that the payback period is ‚Äúnever‚Äù, and the TTM has not decreased, but has magically increased as well as the accident rate.  But the project will continue - now as "image". <br>  The next move of the new bosses is endless regular meetings to combat the consequences of their own brilliant projects (I‚Äôd like to count how many man-hours they are spent on, and multiply by the average salary of the participants). <br>  This is not a joke, reader, not an exaggeration.

It is enough to simulate a hectic activity: in the new data center, install more new servers for backups, etc.  Report in time that everything is ready, ‚ÄúSingle search‚Äù works from the new data center, and for reliability and speed you have made it geo-distributed, for which you have very small carryouts in server rooms throughout the country. <br></div></div><br><br>  That is why, readers, do not say: ‚ÄúYandex is not the same anymore‚Äù, ‚ÄúFormer Yandex is dead‚Äù, etc.  Everything is relative, Yandex is just a living thing - in its years, with its size, and with such attention to it. <br><h2>  5. IT response </h2><br><br>  But not only Yandex is so unique that you don‚Äôt touch it, but it will wither away without intangible motivation.  Wherever it is necessary to work the head, it is. <br>  With IT specialists, the slaveholding system is somehow failing. <br>  Of course, at first you can ride on the ridge of young idealists, but as soon as they lose their intangible motivation, they also quickly think about the material one: <br><blockquote>  <a href="http://blogerator.ru/page/o-merkantilnoj-storone-programmirovanija-valjuta">On the mercantile side of programming</a> <br>  Working for hard currency and living in countries of the economic periphery is incredibly profitable. <br>  Always considered himself a romantic for whom money was not the main thing.  But as they grow up, the appearance of a family, children, responsibility for others, a house-flat, a gradual deterioration in health with the age and the economy around, any romantic will unwittingly become infected with ‚Äúsausage moods‚Äù.  At such a moment of forced ‚Äúgrowing up‚Äù of any romantic, sooner or later a wave of regret, insult, horror is spreading that his youth has been wasted. </blockquote><br><br>  ‚ÄúTo start a tractor‚Äù or work remotely is the first choice of a material solution for IT engineers. <br>  But there are nuances.  Slavery has different forms, and if you pay good money, it does not mean that you are not in a cage. <br><blockquote>  Few of them guessed that by choosing the dead-end happiness of an employee in Silicon Valley, they lost the opportunity to really win.  ‚ÄúThese people, of course, lost a lot,‚Äù Ilya Segalovich will say in twenty years ... <br>  Yandeks.Kniga. </blockquote><br><br>  You do not need to spend 20 years, take into account the experience of others. <br><h2>  6. Why big companies are needed, and who are not able to manage them </h2><br><br>  In our world, which is technically more complex than the Middle Ages, large companies operate in key areas: energy, transport, construction, communications, science, space.  Small companies either cannot solve problems on principle, or their costs will be higher. <br><blockquote>  <a href="http://paidiev.livejournal.com/598830.html">Only large structures can win a place in the international market.</a>  Alone, you can only get the workplace scavenger or a prostitute.  The Soviet corporations were divided into thousands of noncompetitive pieces by greedy directors.  An important role was played by the interests of foreign competitors. <br>  These are people who see all the problems through the quality of finishing their toilet.  Life has forced them to deal with the problems of Russia - the problems they needless and uninteresting.  Hence the desire to simplify them and chat. </blockquote><br><br>  If now one of the organizers of the privatization writes this way ... probably the day is not far off when the Prince of Darkness himself will speak: ‚ÄúThese pseudo-effective managers have even got me!  I gave the hellish engineers the task of developing a special boiler for them. ‚Äù <br><br>  <strong>To manage energy, transport, construction, communications, science, "space", IT needs solutions developed by the technical elite, people with specialized education and experience.</strong> <br><br>  They can not be controlled by the elite of the medieval type - people with the psychology of the slaveholder, ambitions and the desire to "be on top", <a href="http://bohemicus.livejournal.com/94715.html%3Fpage%3D3">whatever you call them</a> . <br>  Ambitiousness and MBA course does not compensate for the lack of education and core expertise. <br><br>  <strong>It is in the Middle Ages that slave owners would be elite.</strong> <strong><br></strong>  <strong>And now, in the eyes of engineers, they are not an elite, but something else.</strong> <br><br>  I do not believe that any of the engineers thinks about the director-slave owner, ‚ÄúOh, how this great man got a good job!

Then he aggravated, then he switched to parasitizing and knocking out the appearance of respecting employees through the fear of losing his job.  At the output of this "devolution" - a person with a deformed psyche.  Everything he could buy, he had already bought, and he was no longer happy about it. <br><br>  There was only one entertainment left for him ... Such a ‚Äúhumanist‚Äù (read: stupid loner in mathematics and physics), at school he felt defective, and now he is compensated in full ... How sweet is he to pull the strings of people ... And sweeter when these are not street sweepers, but engineers (even cooler are RAS academicians). <br><br>  He feels himself a master, but in fact he has dropped to the level of a pinch in his pockets. <br>  For such that they do not do business, you need a special look, and it is better for them to establish a strict framework of restrictions on authority. <br>  Actually, this already means that they are unsuitable for top management - a top manager, by definition, should have fewer restrictions on actions than ordinary employees.  A top manager should have his own inner moral core. <br><br>  Golden youth is therefore not suitable - ‚Äúat the entrance‚Äù, before its appointment to the top management, it is already rubbish, and even after the experience of the ‚Äúgovernment‚Äù even more so.  <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/GIGO">Trash at the entrance - trash at the exit</a> . <br><blockquote>  <i>But this if not resist.</i>  <i>As long as a person is alive - not everything is lost, you can work on yourself.</i>  <i>Set yourself limits yourself.</i>  <i>As a first step - to separate the FOT of top management from the FOT of employees.</i> <br>  <i>The rule ‚ÄúPHT should not grow more than profit‚Äù learned in MBA courses?</i>  <i>Aw, well done.</i>  <i>Now introduce the rule ‚ÄúPremium and salary increases to top management only after compensating employees for inflation‚Äù.</i> <br><br>  <i>You tell the team how you could get hurt in the bank, but you went to lead the production, because</i>  <i>is it more interesting?</i>  <i>And you want to contract like ‚Äúfor interest‚Äù and the rest you want to contract and therefore pay them below the market?</i> <br>  <i>Oh rich and happy man, so distribute your directorship salary and the award among employees, and work for 1 ruble, since you are so interested in this team.</i>  <i>It is then that you will be respected, even if, as a specialist, you are insignificant and for the company and the team just no more than this ruble is worth you.</i>  <i>Stop, no, it's still better - then you will be confused by at least the amount of your s / n and premium!</i>  <i>Such an act is not a tongue waggle, it would be very authoritative.</i> <br><br>  <i>You think, since critics do not hear, does this mean that you are such a competent and skillful manager of a company?</i>  <i>No, these are just the negative effects of the power vertical - you rebuilt the system yourself so as not to hear feedback.</i>  <i>Naked king, get dressed, and you'll catch a cold.</i>  <i>Take on the work of an internal auditor or risk manager, from which you will perceive information.</i>  <i>Let him not submit to you, but as expected - the board of directors.</i>  <i>And let it hurt you - it is pleasant to you, and so many people are willing.</i> <br><br>  <i>Do not break the laws, stop spreading rot to specialists of your company.</i>  <i>Trust them more than new and external consultants.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Study the production cycle of your company with all its features, standards ...</i> <br></blockquote><br><br>  Uh, reader, do you already feel that I drove some tale about the country of pink ponies in italics? <br>  In fact, the requirements for the leader are correctly formulated, but in life this does not happen, right?  Stanislavsky "I do not believe!" Shouted at such a time? <br><br>  You do not believe correctly - they have already made a choice - to become slave owners.  Thus, they themselves have separated themselves from society, and then their choice is narrowed down to the limits of the chosen role.  Self-justification will be, intimidation and suppression of the collective will be, corruption will be, there will be crime and other indecency with explanations of the level ‚ÄúI had no other choice‚Äù.  But there will be no normal qualified management from them. <br><br>  Paradoxical situation - this manual is difficult and it may not be interesting for golden youth, but they are getting on and on.  After their reforms, the financial performance of companies is deteriorating, the leverage is broken that intangible, that of material motivation of staff. <br>  They already have money, you just have to leave with them, until their inconsistency with their position became a common place in conversations on the smoking-room.  Is it nice, having money, to endure spitting <a href="http://www.comnews.ru/node/100677">on your back in the comments</a> , and then in the face? <br><br>  Look, the old man actually spits in the face of the "boss": <br><blockquote>  <a href="http://kommersant.ru/doc/2957801">Just leave our academy - the same old teacher said into the microphone</a> . <br>  - Go away and everything will be fine </blockquote><br><br>  But, apparently, they do not see a ‚Äúother way out‚Äù, except for an increase: <a href="http://www.rbc.ru/rbcfreenews/570ceeca9a7947cf8f5c26af%3Futm_source%3Ddlvr.it%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter">Medvedev raised the deputy head of the Ministry of Agriculture who quarreled with a student</a> . <br><br>  Promotion, and increasing degrees of confrontation with the team. <br><h2>  9.

Do you not consider it natural when your salary grows over time due to the growth of your qualifications and benefits for the company? <br><br>  According to the law of the Russian Federation, which in this part fully corresponds to the natural law, the top management of rich large enterprises should have done this: <br><blockquote>  <a href="http://www.consultant.ru/document/cons_doc_LAW_34683/12fdabe1c6c090a33e327161c95b4d430b5629c9/">Labor Code of the Russian Federation, Article 134. Ensuring the increase in the real content of wages</a> <br>  Ensuring an increase in the real content of wages includes the indexation of wages due to an increase in consumer prices for goods and services.  State bodies, local governments, state and municipal institutions produce wage indexation in the manner prescribed by labor legislation and other regulatory legal acts containing labor law norms, other employers in the manner established by collective agreement, agreements, local normative acts. </blockquote><br><br>  Officials of the Federal Labor Agency official letter in 2010 gave an explanation that it is the responsibility of all enterprises, including commercial ones. <br><br>  In 2014, this was confirmed by the Constitutional Court: <br><blockquote>  <a href="http://xn----7sbbaj7auwnffhk.xn--p1ai/article/1242">Last year, in the Definition of July 17, 2014 No. 1707-, the arbitrators of the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation indicated</a> that the employer does not have the right to deprive employees of the statutory guarantee and evade the establishment of an indexation procedure in a collective or labor contract or in a local regulatory act. </blockquote><br><br>  Only the difficult financial situation of the company can be the basis for refusal from indexation of salaries: <br><blockquote>  The Definition of the Moscow City Court of September 12, 2014 No. 4g / 1-9076 states that the employer's obligation to index salary is not unconditional, but depends on various factors, including the economic indicators of the organization.  If the company has unfulfilled monetary obligations, including debts owed to employees on the basis of court decisions, this indicates the difficult financial situation of the company and, therefore, the absence of conditions for salary indexation. </blockquote><br><br>  If the net profit is fixed, it means that this enterprise should have indexed the salaries of its employees by at least the amount of inflation. <br><br>  State-owned companies, by the way, had the opportunity to execute the law and index salaries in 2016 before paying dividends <br><blockquote>  <a href="https://megamozg.ru/post/24928/">According to Shevchuk, most state-owned companies have substantial accumulated retained earnings</a> - a total of more than 6.6 trillion rubles.  This allows you to pay dividends that exceed net profit under RAS. </blockquote><br><br>  Well, felt the indexation of wages? <br><br>  Or maybe they felt in Beeline, which in 2015 has an undistributed profit of 32.6 billion with a payroll of 19.4 billion? <br><br>  <font color="#cc0000">UPDATE 1</font> : <br>  Here Beeline reports directly on its website: <br>  The amount of accrued remuneration of key personnel <a href="http://static.beeline.ru/upload/images/OJSC_VimpelCom_IFRS_FS_2014_RUS.pdf">in 2014 = 301777 tr.</a>  (page 37), and <a href="http://static.beeline.ru/upload/images/Financial%2520statements%2520disclosure_PJSC%2520VC_2015_28.03.16.doc">in 2015 = 773936</a> (page 36). <br>  Not bad top management has grown in price.  To the rest, Mikhail proposes <a href="http://slobodin.livejournal.com/167561.html">"not to wait for mercy in the form of indexation from the employer</a> . <a href="http://slobodin.livejournal.com/167561.html">"</a>  You understand that the "grace" was all for him, it was not enough for you. <br><br>  Well, if not in Beeline, then maybe in Gazprom employees were lucky with indexation?  I would let someone know, but they only write about the top management in the news.  <a href="http://www.rbc.ru/business/16/05/2016/573a0a4b9a7947d5d5f2402d">Revenues of board members - only 17 people - doubled in the first quarter of this year.</a>  <a href="http://www.rbc.ru/business/16/05/2016/573a0a4b9a7947d5d5f2402d">They amounted to 1.142 billion rubles, while last year for the same period - 558 million rubles</a> . <br><br>  <font color="#cc0000">UPDATE 2</font> : <br>  At the urgent request of <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/biochemist/" class="user_link">Biochemist,</a> I give a note to this paragraph. <br>  The employer according to the law is only obliged to come to an agreement with the team on the indexing procedure.  The parameters of this indexation are in fact given to him at the mercy. <br>  If indexing seemed insufficient to you, then to sue is only to your own detriment. <br>  <a href="http://www.garant.ru/article/697069">Here is a good article</a> that shows all the futility of the courts with the employer. <br>  You can raise the maximum compensation of inflation for 3 months.  In the kit, you know, dismissal. <br>  The law in this form is practically useless, and it is not at all terrible to violate it. <br><h2>  10. Everything is under control </h2><br><blockquote>  <a href="https://www.znak.com/2016-03-23/v_pravitelstve_rf_priznali_rezkoe_padenie_dohodov_rossiyan">Speaking at the Russian Business Week in Moscow</a> , the Deputy Prime Minister of the Russian Federation, Olga Golodets, acknowledged a sharp drop in household incomes and promised that the state would directly take up wage regulation. <br>  ‚ÄúWe have a very sharp drop in income.  Sharp - and in real wages, and in general income.  This all reflects on the decline in the purchasing power of the population, and this all reflects on the retail turnover, which is declining, and declining at such a serious pace, ‚Äùsaid Golodets in her speech. <br>  ‚ÄúIn this regard, it seems to me that the issue of wages and very serious negotiations with employers and with representatives of employees is on the agenda regarding including mechanisms for regulating wages.  We are preparing a general agreement, and this year we should approach it completely informally, ‚Äùshe added. </blockquote><br><br>  I don‚Äôt know if anyone believes in help from Golodets, especially since <a href="http://actualcomment.ru/ulyukaev-zamorazhivaet-zarplaty-1605101052.html">Ulyukayev is against it</a> .  The president <a href="http://www.rbc.ru/politics/16/05/2016/5739e4a79a79479b197077e4">also promised to connect to this topic</a> , probably as an arbiter between them. <br><br>  The fact is, Golodets clearly does not want to improve the TC, and wants to use some other, ‚Äúcompletely informal‚Äù methods.  If the vice-premier of the Government of the Russian Federation has forgotten that everything you need already exists in TK, then the top management of commercial enterprises can also forget about TK.  Well, as Aeroflot does.  Courts-laws them by the side - still do not pay. <br><br>  In addition to not complying with the law and court decisions, there is one more powerful factor of peace of the slave-owning top management in violation of the Labor Code. <br><br>  <strong>Relying on HR and ‚Äúsecurity departments‚Äù, they form their own trade union of slave owners, which does not hire disloyal employees.</strong> <br><br>  Sometimes the flogging of a servant of a servile rank <a href="http://slobodin.livejournal.com/142094.html">who</a> imagines himself <a href="http://slobodin.livejournal.com/142094.html">is public</a> .  Analysis of this whipping itself is worthy of a separate article. <br><br>  The threat of reprisals ‚Äúyes, you will not find work afterwards‚Äù is certainly a powerful tool - it practically multiplies by zero the protest of employees against the illegal redistribution of payroll funds in favor of top management. <br><br>  But it is also clear that this threat forms a special internal environment of the company.  This side effect is not acceptable for all organizations. <br><br>  At one time, Yandex‚Äôs managers were able to explain this to ‚Äúfriendly investors‚Äù who came to them with a bag of money, honor of them and eternal glory.  But here Google helped them a lot - if it were not for the competitive environment, if Yandex was then in the state.  support, guaranteeing its existence in any scenario, then it would be unlikely to get out.  By the way, time has passed, help from the state for Yandex has become more tangible ( <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/250887/">one</a> , <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/266857/">two</a> , <a href="http://secretmag.ru/longread/2015/03/20/kak-yandex-vouet-s-google-za-domashnii-rinok/">three</a> ). <br><br>  In total, according to HH, it turns out that TK in Russia is massively disrupted at enterprises with more than 1,000 people. <br>  Top management does not fulfill the law, and believes that they have ‚Äúeverything is under control.‚Äù  And it is going to continue in the same spirit in 2016: <br><blockquote>  <a href="http://hh.ru/article/306101%3Ffrom%3Darticle_303214">Of the 700 organizations that shared information with the ‚ÄúWage Data Bank‚Äù</a> , only 34% plan to index salaries next year. </blockquote><br><br>  Top management has convinced itself that it has the ‚Äúright of the strong‚Äù to index salary only to itself, and you can have employees in every way.  Including - do not pay for work at night and holidays. <br><h2>  11. Audit also paid for? </h2><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúControl over the correctness of calculations of labor remuneration, its assignment to the appropriate accounts of accounting, compliance with the legislation on labor remuneration, correctness of accounting of hours worked, timeliness of indexation taking into account price increases in the context of inflation is one of the main tasks of the audit.‚Äù </blockquote><br><br>  The conviction of a naked king in his own greatness makes it difficult to realize that violation of the law will sooner or later be classified by external audit as a risk. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.accounting-degree.org/scandals/">For some time, an audit may fail and not notice ...</a> , but there are signs that the <a href="https://lenta.ru/news/2016/02/19/vimpelcom/">audit is no longer showing its former loyalty</a> . <br>  "Hybrid War", however. <br><br>  <strong>Slaveholders violate the law by enterprises for auditing comments.</strong> <br><br>  As for night work, I will add that for large PJSC there are audit requirements for IT processes.  In particular, there is a requirement to have a system for recording incidents and work (changes).  It is enough for an audit to take unloading from it (yes, they take it, and so they only need to add a couple of fields), analyze the amount of work at an inopportune time, compare it with documents from the personnel department, as they paid the employees for these works ... <br>  And here is another remark on the violation of the law, with a very specific amount for the requirement of the accrual of the reserve. <br><br>  No, well, I understand that in the Excel table, the head of the department keeps track of debts for extracurricular work, and then informally releases employees away from work.  But this is exactly what is unofficially - you can't sew it to the case. <br><br>  Suppose top management did not provide compensation for inflation for employees and payment for work outside business hours.  This is about 10-20% of the annual salary rate for 2015 - it seems that a bit. <br><br>  <font color="#cc0000">UPDATE 3</font> : <br><br><del>  But who said that the amount of risk for an audit report should be for 1 year?  The limitation period is 3 years. </del><br><del>  And if the plan is to wait, in order to increase the amount of risk?  And then choose the right moment, when at the same time the company will have less profit, and notice a violation of the law ... </del><br><blockquote><del>  Do not recognize the profit in the amount of X billion rubles in connection with the violation of the TC. </del><br><del>  Accrual reserve ... Correct US GAAP statements ... </del></blockquote><br><br><del>  And then the fall in stocks, to which someone was ready and knows what to do. </del><br><br><del>  Audit can be especially attentive <a href="https://megamozg.ru/post/25568/">when selling a company</a> . </del><br><br>  <a href="http://www.garant.ru/article/697069">Here they write that they pay not for 3 years, but only for 3 months</a> .  A purely symbolic amount is obtained - about 3.5% of the annual payroll. <br>  For example, for Beeline, it‚Äôs only 700 million rubles.  (FOT 19.4 billion). <br>  A trifle, of course, but in my opinion, in my opinion, it still draws me. <br><br>  Or maybe I'm wrong, and auditors will close their eyes to violations of the law.  Maybe they do not consider the risk of violation of the law, since there is no wave of appeals to the courts, and payments for won cases are still not made? <br>  We'll see‚Ä¶ <br><h2>  12. In plain language </h2><br><br>  Well, climb into this hole even deeper, find out whose it really is.  And then maybe the title "slave owner" for someone sounds still pretty proud. <br><br>  The fact that the company is large means that you really need a lot of employees to complete the task. <br>  Those.  the money goes to her not for nothing, the profits for the company are really earned by the employees. <br><blockquote>  When money is donated, then the employees are not particularly needed, and the theoretical limits of optimization are fairly quickly reached: <a href="http://izvestia.ru/news/564924">Only 1 employee remains - the general director, who is also an accountant</a> . <br>  By the way, such a ‚Äúeffective‚Äù business likes to take a natural mafia under its wing. </blockquote><br><br>  So, we have a situation where employees and top management work on the payroll in the same proportion as before, but a smaller share is now cut into employees, and they are actually getting poorer.  And top management itself cuts more and gets richer. <br>  The basis is <abbr title="Hoc volo, sic jubeo, sit pro ratione voluntas">So I want, so I command the</abbr> top management, and nothing more.  Fig leaves other explanations do not count. <br><blockquote>  No, I understand that in dollars they can then go for it, but the salary and bonus allegedly they have correspond to the results of their work. <br>  An approach that "Complies with generally accepted international practice", as Rosneft OJSC puts it, <a href="http://www.rosneft.ru/docs/report/2014/governance/remuneration.html">giving its Board 2.8 billion rubles</a> .  But if the result of the company's work ‚Äî revenue and profit ‚Äî is in rubles, then why should top management want to calculate its share in dollars? </blockquote><br><br>  In terminology that is understandable to top managers like the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DBqMvzTVhtY8">well-known director of the polymer coatings workshop</a> , the <strong>payroll is common</strong> . <br><br>  <strong>The one who from obschak pulls on himself more, robbing the others - <a href="https://ru.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2592%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B9_%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD">rattle</a> .</strong> <br><br>  Who has already managed to shout out "the goose pig is not a friend"?  I know myself, I don‚Äôt need a rat for comrades. <br>  The point is that top managers themselves continuously sing a song, that they are one team with employees. <br>  True, Gref is already openly positioning that he is not like everyone else, he himself is the type of illuminate, and he keeps the rest in ignorance ... <br><br>  In any case there are two options: either a single team with the top rats, or there is no team, but there are slaves controlled by the top barin. <br><br>  In life, of course, there is no clear dichotomy, but there is a harmonious combination of both options in a continuous evolution from one to another. <br>    ,    ¬´    ¬ª,        . <br><br>        ‚Äì    .             -    . <br><br>  ,  ,      ‚Ä¶ <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8e7/92a/68b/8e792a68b1fa49a782d1859bb0b41458.jpg"><br><br> <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259A%25D1%2580%25D1%258B%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25B9_%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C"> </a> ( 3D-,     ). <br><br> ,     <a href="https://otvet.mail.ru/question/14432998"></a> -  HR  ,   ,      "    ?", "    ?". <br><h2> 13. -  </h2><br><br> <i>    <br>    . <br>  , ,  , <br>     .</i> <br> , ¬´¬ª <br><br>      ,  HR-  ¬´         ¬ª: <br><blockquote>  . .
