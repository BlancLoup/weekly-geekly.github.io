  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Top Amazon Products in 2017</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><p>  Amazon issued a <a href="http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml%3Fc%3D176060%26p%3Dirol-newsArticle%26ID%3D2324045">press release</a> reporting the site‚Äôs best-selling products.  In fact, these are the most popular things in America - not those that are tied up in advertising, but those that real people buy.  Amazon now accounts for almost 50% of online sales in the United States.  The Internet giant owns six thousand trucks and 32 cargo planes.  According to Prime alone (exclusive delivery within two days), the company sent 5 billion items in 2017. </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xb/xm/0v/xbxm0v1ezk2i0-dy5vcycwita7i.jpeg"><br><br><p>  It is curious to see which gadgets Americans buy for themselves (surprisingly, almost all of the top 10 are made up of various devices).  In Russia, many of these things have not even seen <a name="habracut"></a></p><br><br><h3>  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Echo-Dot-Portable-Bluetooth-Speaker-with-Alexa-Black/dp/B01DFKC2SO/ref%3Dsr_1_1%3Fie%3DUTF8%26amp%3Bqid%3D1516735888%26amp%3Bsr%3D8-1%26amp%3Bkeywords%3DEcho%2BDot">Echo Dot</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Fire-TV-Stick-With-Alexa-Voice-Remote-Streaming-Media-Player/dp/B00ZV9RDKK/ref%3Dsr_1_1%3Fie%3DUTF8%26amp%3Bqid%3D1516735931%26amp%3Bsr%3D8-1%26amp%3Bkeywords%3Dfire%2Btv%2Bstick">Fire TV Stick</a> - smart devices with Alex </h3><br><p>  # 1 and # 2 for sales - a smart speaker and a module for turning any TV into a Smart TV with a remote control and voice control.  Both gadgets are released by Amazon itself.  The company says that in 2017 they became the most popular of more than 400,000 items in the store.  In total, people bought "millions" of speakers and remotes (the company does not name exact figures, such is its policy). </p><br><p>  The fact that these two devices have become the most sold, it is not surprising.  Amazon constantly advertises them on its homepage, and removes competing products from its website, launching a <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/pochtoy/blog/297353/">whole war with Google</a> .  This is paying off: Alex takes 90% of the personal assistant market in the United States.  In anything it <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/pochtoy/blog/296907/">is built in</a> , from exoskeletons and robots to smart refrigerators and pianos.  Amazon has an absolute advantage in this market. </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rc/ww/e1/rcwwe1ixtlmjsrahgy5tpeg8q2u.jpeg">

    <p>  In Russia, Echo Dot and Fire TV are poorly known, and, for example, they are very rarely transported through us: Russian devices do not recognize the Russian language, and there is still no such rush to smart homes as in America, in Russia. </p><br><br><h3>  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/TP-Link-Required-Anywhere-Assistant-HS100/dp/B0178IC734/ref%3Dsr_1_4%3Fs%3Dlamps-light%26amp%3Bie%3DUTF8%26amp%3Bqid%3D1516736023%26amp%3Bsr%3D1-4%26amp%3Bkeywords%3DTP-Link%2BSmart%2BPlug">TP-Link Smart Plug</a> - into the socket </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/o6/es/a3/o6esa3zlheq7egu9vypcbefmkwy.jpeg"><br><br><p>  The most popular accessory.  Again, with Alex on board.  Smart Plug is a socket that can work over Wi-Fi.  It can be turned on / off via a smartphone or simply by voice.  The gadget is inserted into an ordinary outlet, and to it, respectively, any other device is connected (lamp, thermostat, bread maker, computer, etc.).  To control the outlet on your smartphone, the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.tplink.kasa_android%26amp%3Bhl%3Dru">Kasa</a> application is downloaded.  You can set the socket to turn on or off at a specified time.  Say, Monday through Friday at 07:30.  On Amazon, the gadget costs $ 24.99.  In 2017, he became especially popular in Britain (there he is number 1). </p><br><h3>  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s/ref%3Dnb_sb_noss%3Furl%3Dsearch-alias%253Delectronics%26amp%3Bfield-keywords%3DWowWee%2BFingerlings">WowWee Fingerlings</a> - the most popular toy </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/_e/xl/da/_exldapgyompmp6kkpp_-ej7pqw.jpeg"><br><br><p>  Spinners and fjj-cubes, it turns out, is no longer in fashion.  By the end of the year, little monkeys and fingerlings became the best-selling toy on Amazon.  They sit on a finger and sit / hang there.  Each has its own color and name (Boris Blue, Finn Black, Bella Red, Sofia White).  The main reason for why they cost $ 15, and not $ 3, - apparently, in their interactivity.  They pay attention to the sounds, movements and touches, reacting by turning the head, eye movement and monkey babble.  For example, if you put them on your finger head down, they will rotate on it.  If you kiss, they will make a joyful sound and try to kiss in response.  If you shake back and forth, they will start falling asleep.  And so on.  In total - more than forty animations and sound effects. </p><br><p>  In the last two months of 2017, Amazon customers have bought so many interactive finger monkey models that they can pave the length of the Eiffel Tower from top to bottom 150 times. </p><br><br><h3>  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nerf-N-Strike-Elite-Strongarm-Blaster/dp/B00DW1JT5G/ref%3Dsr_1_4%3Fs%3Dtoys-and-games%26amp%3Bie%3DUTF8%26amp%3Bqid%3D1516736182%26amp%3Bsr%3D1-4%26amp%3Bkeywords%3DNerf%2BN-Strike%2BElite%2BStrongarm%2BBlaster">Nerf N-Strike Elite Strongarm Blaster</a> - the most popular toy in the USA </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/6v/n3/zc/6vn3zcpkwjlhkokkl7ynu0sg2xi.jpeg"><br><br><p>  Fingerlings were taken in India, in China, in Britain, and in Canada.  But the most popular specifically in the US was a slightly different toy - a plastic pistol.  Americans are known for their love of arms, and, apparently, it starts from a young age.  It's funny, by the way, that all fingerlings on the store preview are worn on a white finger, but a black teenager shoots a gun at a photo (accident? Or marketing?).  Clip - six plastic "darts", flying at a distance of 30 meters.  Weapons can be switched to rapid-fire mode.  Worth $ 12.99. </p><br><br><h3>  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Instant-Pot-Programmable-Pressure-Steamer/dp/B01B1VC13K/ref%3Dsr_1_cc_1%3Fs%3Daps%26amp%3Bie%3DUTF8%26amp%3Bqid%3D1516736125%26amp%3Bsr%3D1-1-catcorr%26amp%3Bkeywords%3DInstant%2BPot%2BDUO80">Instant Pot DUO80</a> - Best Selling Kitchen <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Instant-Pot-Programmable-Pressure-Steamer/dp/B01B1VC13K/ref%3Dsr_1_cc_1%3Fs%3Daps%26amp%3Bie%3DUTF8%26amp%3Bqid%3D1516736125%26amp%3Bsr%3D1-1-catcorr%26amp%3Bkeywords%3DInstant%2BPot%2BDUO80">Appliance</a> </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xd/li/ev/xdlievsyirxq5yd32en3q_rfr4y.jpeg"><br><br><p>  Two heads taller than all the others in the "Kitchen" section was the Instant Pot pressure cooker.  In general, we can say, the surprise of the year.  It became the most popular following world sales in the USA / Canada.  Apparently, for the holidays from Thanksgiving until Christmas, 9 million pieces bought it (Amazon says, ‚Äúenough to make 9 million bowls of chili,‚Äù but it‚Äôs unclear what kind of bowls they think).  Instant Pot combines 7 kitchen appliances and contains 14 cooking programs.  Worth $ 129.99. </p><br><p>  Amazon says the device has become the most popular gift for a wedding and Christmas to parents.  Also, this site cooker users most often added to their ‚ÄúWish List‚Äù. </p><br><br><h3>  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Finishing-Touch-Flawless-Painless-Remover/dp/B071KW9GTT">Flawless Women's Painless Hair Remover</a> - for women </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/4o/qq/75/4oqq758t1ceu8-okoca_zk8lqrk.jpeg"><br><br><p>  ‚Ññ1 in the "Cosmetics".  Electronic thing for removing excess hair.  In fact, if you read the specifications, it's just a razor, only in a different package, similar to a tube of lipstick, so that Americans would not be ashamed to use it.  Well, a lot of marketing terms ("Approved by dermatologists", "Hypoalergenic" and so on).  But it looks nice, of course, and, they say, it works painlessly.  Worth $ 19. </p><br><br><h3>  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fitbit-Charge-Fitness-Wristband-Version/dp/B01K9S24EM%3Fth%3D1">Fitbit Charge 2</a> - Fitness Bracelet </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/la/bl/fn/lablfnuzoitvobknmnbvovere5u.jpeg"><br><br><p>  The most popular of the "Things for health and personal hygiene".  A cardio bracelet that tracks heart rate, calorie consumption, cycles, and sleep duration.  Best in 2017 was sold on January 8, which is funny.  Apparently, millions of Americans made a promise to definitely lose weight in the new year, and took a bracelet before they changed their minds. </p><br><p>  It is also interesting that the number 2 and number 3 sales in the same category are the kits for genetic tests, 23andMe DNA and AncestryDNA.  He took a sample of his saliva, sent it to the right address, and after 6-8 weeks you get online access to your genetic profile.  With information on health hazards, characteristics and pedigree.  In America, love. </p><br><br><h3>  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/BLACK-DECKER-LDX120C-Lithium-Ion-Cordless/dp/B005NNF0YU">Black + Decker LDX 120C 20-Volt MAX</a> - the most popular work tool </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/7b/x6/1t/7bx61tnuqkle43d3vgtevdv2e6s.jpeg"><br><br><p>  Electric drill with a lithium-ion battery for $ 37 (2100 rubles).  With adjustable speed so as not to damage the material when drilling, and 11 positions for precise control.  Drills into wood, plastic, metal.  It weighs 1.47 kg, so that both women and teenagers can handle it.  No comments. </p><br><br><h3>  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Snark-SN5X-Guitar-Violin-Current/dp/B01H74YV56">Snark SN5X Clip-On</a> - for tuning your guitar </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/-w/js/qt/-wjsqtdpz0szh7munwf_ka60df4.jpeg"><br><br><p>  In the category "Musical Instruments" won ... tuner for guitar.  The second and third place, too, for small gadgets.  These tools for extracting music for sales did not come even close. </p><br><br><h3>  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/TCL-32S305-32-Inch-Smart-Model/dp/B01MU1GBLL/ref%3Dsr_1_1%3Fs%3Dmusical-instruments%26amp%3Bie%3DUTF8%26amp%3Bqid%3D1516737235%26amp%3Bsr%3D8-1%26amp%3Bkeywords%3DTCL%2B32-Inch%2B720p%2BRoku%2BSmart%2BLED%2BTV">TCL 32-Inch 720p Roku Smart LED TV</a> - the most sought-after TV </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zz/fx/it/zzfxituk2y9jzhzvlqq-nwggxkc.jpeg"><br><br><p>  Only during the holidays, Amazon bought so many televisions that you can ‚Äúsketch out‚Äù 5,000 towers high in the Statue of Liberty.  The 32-inch model of release 2017 from Chinese TCL became the most sold.  Nothing supernatural: Smart TV, Wi-Fi, 3 HDMI ports, one USB connector.  Of the features except a simple remote for 20 buttons and an application for a smartphone to transfer video and photos from it to the TV.  Apparently, the Americans chose the model because of its low price: Prime users can take a TV for $ 149, for the rest the cost starts at $ 169.  TVs with a diagonal of 50+ inches in sales in 2017 were not even included in the top-5. </p><br><br><h3>  PS </h3><br><p>  If anything, Amazon does not like to deliver directly to Russia.  And if it delivers, it is very expensive.  But if you register with Pochtoy.com, you can get yourself an American address for shipping goods.  Prices for the delivery of 0.5 kg from the US to Russia, we have from $ 8.99.  And users who enter GEEKTIMES code after <a href="http://bit.ly/PochtoyGeek">registration</a> receive $ 7 per account. </p></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/371197/">https://habr.com/ru/post/371197/</a></p>
