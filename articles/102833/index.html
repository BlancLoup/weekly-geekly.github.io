Xoogler-based startups are known all over the world because they were either acquired by Google, or by its competitors, or found funding from other Xooglers and made new trails on the Internet. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a3e/258/000/a3e2580005189fcb2d3a3d38c168480f.jpg" alt="image">

      Here is a description of 15 companies that have emerged in the minds of the people who used to work on the web. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h5>  1. <a href="http://www.ooyala.com/">Ooyala</a> </h5><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d71/e45/c5a/d71e45c5a9eef653549b10da5f4ab32b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Ooyala is a platform for online video publishing and monetization.  It was founded by ex-Google employees Sean Knapp, Bismarck Lepe and Belses√©r Lepe (Sean Knapp, Bismarck Lepe, and Belsasar Lepe) in 2007.  The main function is to add promotional links to video content.  The service also provides many additional opportunities for entrepreneurship, including analytics tools and means of delivering content to mobile devices. <br><br>  Since its launch, Ooyala and its video backlot platform have been used by such serious companies as Dell, Electronic Arts, Hearst Corporation, Telegraph Media Group to manage and monetize their video assets. <br><br><h5>  2. <a href="http://wam.dasient.com/wam/">Dasient</a> </h5><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d97/333/3e5/d973333e50e18a2fbe58dc916a5b0c7b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Placing malware on third-party web resources is a virus-spreading method convenient for cyber-criminals, eliminating the need to send a virus via email to each of its victims individually.  Often, sites from which the distribution occurred, ultimately remain in the black lists of search engines, even after the threat has been removed. <br><br>  Dasient helps sites keep track of the presence of malicious code so that the site will not end up on the scary blacklist.  Two of the three founders who created the company in 2009 are former Google employees.  Neil Daswani worked as a security engineer and Shariq Rizvi was a member of Google‚Äôs Webserver and App Engine teams.  The third founder is Amit Ranadive (Ameet Ranadive) - a former McKinsey consultant on strategic issues. <br><br><h5>  3. <a href="http://tellapart.com/">Tell Apart</a> </h5><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/67d/f75/415/67df754151245e8ea4f7fddc1abe7a6f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Developed by the same guys who founded the Google AdWords API team in 2004.  Tell Apart works with e-commerce data of client companies.  The goal is to identify the main customers in the market and predict potential customers.  For the same customers, Tell Apart also creates individual layouts of ads, and also serves them offline. <br><br><h5>  4. <a href="http://www.cuil.com/">Cuil</a> </h5><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7fd/82c/e61/7fd82ce61299fe176c8455fcc0e2d26a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  It is not surprising that Anna Patterson, a former search index architect for Google, started creating her own search engine.  However, it is rare to find a search engine that would differ from the standard list of blue links.  Cuil algorithmically clusters the results so that for the search for ‚ÄúAbraham Lincoln‚Äù there is a creation of separate report pages for such keywords as ‚ÄúAbraham Lincoln‚Äù, ‚ÄúPresident Abraham Lincoln‚Äù and ‚ÄúAbraham Lincoln‚Äôs team‚Äù.  In addition to the traditional search results, Cuil combines links to create a report on information groups and keywords on a given topic. <br><br><h5>  5. <a href="http://friendfeed.com/">FriendFeed</a> </h5><br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/N7AaCD94II0%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhi8tSn3HfvHn58BQzMpI8-M_mZbdQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  FriendFeed allows users to share photos, articles and other media content in the form of news feeds.  Your friends can comment and mark content as you like.  Sounds familiar?  After shamelessly borrowing the key features of a startup, Facebook bought FriendFeed in 2009, leading co-founder of FriendFeed and Gmail's creator Paul Buchheit. <br><br><h5>  6. <a href="http://www.redbeacon.com/">Redbeacon</a> </h5><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/07a/c34/779/07ac34779a4f4493642af1c4cb7756c9.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Redbeacon is an advanced version of Craigslist that helps users find qualified artists for almost any job.  The user indicates the type of work to be done, the deadlines, and local specialists are fighting for the right to perform work in the categories of low cost and accessibility. <br><br>  When a user chooses who he wants to hire, Redbeacon allows you to order the service online.  Agree, not exactly the expected startup from Ethan Anderson and Aaron Lee (Ethan Anderson and Aaron Lee), who were responsible for launching the Google video platform before acquiring YouTube in 2006, or from Yaron Binur, who led Google News . <br><br><h5>  7. <a href="http://www.geoapi.com/">Mixer Labs</a> </h5><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b00/f88/ec2/b00f88ec2d5914786c1304cf4cf1b3b0.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  One of the co-founders of Mixer Labs was also one of the founders of the Google Mobile Team.  He was the first project manager for Google Mobile Maps.  The GeoAPI service from Mixer Labs allows developers to integrate a location definition into their applications.  Twitter apparently decided that it was possible to use such a service for myself, and acquired Mixer Labs in December 2009. <br><br><h5>  8. <a href="http://www.howcast.com/">Howcast</a> </h5><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b00/205/db9/b00205db951b7db467d3e91e96ed7fbf.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  All three Howcast founders worked for the Google Video Team at one time or another.  Their startup focuses on the production of training videos - everything from ‚ÄúHow to cope with boring office work‚Äù to ‚ÄúHow to make yourself work‚Äù.  The founders say they are approaching the number of 2,000,000 downloads through the iPhone, iPad, Android and BlackBerry devices. <br><br><h5>  9. <a href="http://www.mylikes.com/">MyLikes</a> </h5><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/071/bd5/afd/071bd5afd0f4f8ae07c28bb83e2e5d00.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  MyLikes allows any member of a social network to sell advertising.  Subscribers express personal approval for certain products that appear on their Twitter and Facebook accounts.  Every time a friend clicks on an advertisement, MyLikes pays the person who placed the advertisement, or makes a charitable contribution to the fund chosen by the subscriber. <br><br>  The co-founders Bindu Reddy and Arvid Sandararajan (Bindu Reddy and Arvind Sundararajan) do not complete the list of former Google employees who believe in this idea.  The company <a href="http://www.marketwire.com/press-release/MyLikes-Secures-630K-in-Seed-Funding-1168324.htm">consists</a> entirely <a href="http://www.marketwire.com/press-release/MyLikes-Secures-630K-in-Seed-Funding-1168324.htm">of former Google employees</a> . <br><br><h5>  10. <a href="http://www.weatherbill.com/">Weatherbill</a> </h5><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/aea/370/60c/aea37060c6007d979b2b6361f250f730.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Many insurance companies offer to insure an umbrella, but only a few will insure against rain.  Former Google employees David Friedberg and Siraj Khaliq created Weatherbill to insure those companies that could suffer significant damage due to unexpected weather changes. <br><br>  Event planners, ski resorts, snow removal services, and tourism-related businesses that appear and disappear depending on weather conditions, can use the service to save the day.  <a href="http://www.weatherbill.com/company/press">Barbados, for example, uses Weatherbill</a> to offer guests $ 100 of compensation for each day that the weather can be viewed by visitors as "imperfect." <br><br><h5>  11. <a href="http://www.doapps.com/">Doapp</a> </h5><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d62/d8c/bd7/d62d8cbd7b9f0a33d0a94cbb9ca9d7ed.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Joe Sriver, the founder of Doapp, was the first Google user interface designer.  The company is focused on ‚ÄúDeveloping applications for websites, desktops and mobile devices that will help you do useful things, increase productivity and improve the standard of living online.‚Äù In addition, this is the developer of the beloved <a href="http://mashable.com/2008/07/28/iphone-apps-that-will-clean-out-you-junk-drawer/">Whoopie Cushion App</a> . <br><br><h5>  12. <a href="http://mashable.com/2009/08/13/remail/">reMail</a> </h5><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/87b/71c/ce9/87b71cce9d9645ca2ad5229e3dbe5f97.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  ReMail provides advanced email search capabilities for iPhone.  At least this was the case until Google acquired it from the founder Gabor Cselle in February.  Proving the postulate that you ‚Äúcan never completely leave Google,‚Äù Tsele re-joined the product management team of Google after the acquisition. <br><br><h5>  13. <a href="http://vark.com/">Aardvark</a> </h5><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9ab/cd6/f8d/9abcd6f8d66f45c814551c6da1ba6cb9.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Another startup, founded by ex-Google employees just to be acquired by Google, Aardvark takes your questions and finds people on your own social network who can answer them.  Instead of spamming your requests to all friends who are online, which you can do without outside help, Aardvark finds friends and friends of friends who most likely have an answer to your question.  In this way, you‚Äôll only annoy a few people with your question about your favorite restaurants in Denver, instead of worrying a lot of people who haven‚Äôt even been there. <br><br>  Google paid $ 50 million for the company in February 2010 - the service is still a project of Google Labs, but it could be part of Google Search or Android. <br><br><h5>  14. <a href="http://www.hawthornelabs.com/">Hawthorne Labs</a> </h5><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bff/30b/613/bff30b613c46d7b1dad997d4ff024a40.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Appolo is a type of newspaper for iPad, but cooler.  This is just one of the products from Hawthorne Labs.  One of the key features is an algorithm that evaluates which articles and sources interest you, and helps you find new material based on personal preferences and viewing history.  Co-founder Shubham Mittal previously worked both at Microsoft and at Google, but in the context of this post, we still call Hawthorne Labs a start-up from Xoogler. <br><br><h5>  15. <a href="http://etherpad.com/">AppJet</a> </h5><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/UpxLLzgQ-1Y%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhiUqQh30VoUy9cR2bROx2zPfcgHKg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Two of the three founders of AppJet were engineers at Google.  And since Google acquired AppJet 8 months ago, they are working on Google again.  The team that created the real-time document collaboration system EtherPad has joined the now- <a href="http://mashable.com/2010/08/04/rip-google-wave/">resting Google Wave</a> project. <br><br>  As in the epilogue of the original article, I suggest here to post Xoogler startups that have attracted your attention here in the comments. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/102833/">https://habr.com/ru/post/102833/</a></p>
