So is it time to make loyalty with a zero price for the user? <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3f0/ccc/43f/3f0ccc43f2584de9949afe7eb749a27b.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Loyalty is always a payment for waiting for more in the future.  Most loyalty systems are built on the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa discount and most implementations have one major drawback - the consumer says: ‚ÄúUninteresting, thank you!‚Äù.  Let's try to understand why this is happening and where everything is moving. <br><br>  <b>Loyalty now</b> <br><br>  <u>Free - as the highest degree of loyalty</u> <br>  A good example of this approach is the strategy of software giants in selling cloud services.  <a href="https://onedrive.live.com/about/ru-ru/">Onedrive</a> as a result of this model will receive all users of desktop office applications.

      <u>Loyalty for action</u> <br>  ‚ÄúGo there ‚Äî I don‚Äôt know where, buy it ‚Äî I don‚Äôt know what‚Äù - banks offer such programs today.  I do not need loyalty based on my constant efforts to buy and the limitations of the premium received - I am not interested in making mandatory purchases and storing the participant‚Äôs mandatory limit on my credit card 30 times the cashback. <br><br>  With electronic payment systems, things are better, but everything spoils the limitations of the offer of discounts from partners in time.  I cannot decide to buy an offer in 5 days - I need to think and it is more logical to make such offers indefinite. <br>  And miles?  Here again, the imbalances in the obligations with an uninteresting result. <br><br>  <u>Soup sets offers</u> <br>  Berry (from the name) carpet bombing no longer works.  Everybody is tired of consuming - everyone cannot consume everything.  The pool of partners of similar loyalty programs is too overheated and the consumer is simply lost in all its diversity, and as a result, the discount card left at home.  ABC analysis of the proposal no longer works when the strategy of the program developer to constantly expand the pool of disparate partners. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c3e/452/075/c3e452075fd44c4a897a5c3174d92753.png"><br>  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/s.vyaltsev">Stepan</a> glad!  Be like Stepan! <br><br>  <u>Group purchases</u> <br>  I am not a supporter of the whole group, but it works and aha, as long as they give you a discount. <br><br>  <u>One-time big discounts</u> <br>  I do not excuse myself in our location completely in the form of cyber-Monday and black Fridays in the digital world. <br><br>  <u>Advertising models are not about loyalty</u> <br>  As soon as people stop getting free - they will buy a similar service with better quality and cheaper.  For example, now everyone is talking about MVNO, the launch of which is all postponed and postponed.  MVNO plans to launch free communication services for an advertising model.  It feels like LTV = package of services and the only chance to survive is to cover expenses at the expense of advertisers.  Do advertisers want this when they realize that they are overpaying? <br><br>  What is wrong with loyalty - <br><ul><li>  Basis of all systems - discount </li><li>  Discount pure uninteresting </li><li>  Low discount rates for big efforts </li><li>  The audience of users of programs is blurred. </li><li>  There are fears of losing bonuses </li></ul><br>  <b>Loyalty 2.0</b> <br><br>  There is good news and relatively new loyalty formats.  <a href="http://www.cnews.ru/news/line/2016-06-14_mts_sdelala_mobilnuyu_svyaz_besplatnoj_dlya_vladeltsev">Today, MTS Company and MTS-Bank</a> announced the start of sales of the MTS Smart Money card, the owners of which, when using banking services, will be able to use the Internet free of charge at home and on trips around the country.  A new <s>reality has</s> emerged: loyalty, the center of which shifts from discounts to the plane of unification around the base value or the unification of several complementary values ‚Äã‚Äã‚Äúfor one‚Äôs own‚Äù.  How? <br><br>  <u>User clubs</u> <br>  The principle of clubs - additional values ‚Äã‚Äãaround the core services for customers.  It is important that additional values ‚Äã‚Äãare often of higher order - for example, business education.  An example of a format is Sberbank's <a href="http://main.dasreda.ru/">Business Environment</a> / Project, which is engaged in the comprehensive support of its customers.  Loyalty from dasred is <br><ul><li>  Studying programs </li><li>  SaaS servises </li><li>  Product Market </li><li>  <a href="http://www.banki.ru/news/lenta/%3Fid%3D8996278">Service "Return of taxes"</a> </li></ul><br>  Where is the discount? <br><br>  Another example is a small startup <a href="https://dentalcloud.pro/">Dental Cloud</a> , <a href="https://dentalcloud.pro/club/">whose club</a> offers discounts from suppliers of medical equipment, consumables, consulting and information services.  Those.  user clubs can run companies of any size. <br><br>  <u>Worlds unification</u> <br>  <a href="http://ru.wargaming.net/">Wargaming</a> players are happy people and they can move in the missions of the game, acquiring real services and values ‚Äã‚Äãfor <a href="http://rt.ru/">rt.ru</a> for the currency of the world.  Today it is one of the successful cases of worlds integration.  But there is one thing - equivalent partners can afford such an association. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/045/f27/e18/045f27e182934eb195b583068326b09c.png"><br><br>  <u>Transformation into free</u> <br>  The recipe for a loyalty system tomorrow may look like this. <br><ul><li>  There is a basic value and it is not necessarily money. </li><li>  One of these values ‚Äã‚Äãis Internet access. </li><li>  The loyalty program attracts niche services that are ready to work on Pay-per-Sale (PPS) </li><li>  For example, services for travelers or another niche. </li><li>  Further, the failure of the Internet provider to receive a premium and the accrual of this bonus to the user. </li><li>  Crediting bonuses (bonuses) to the user's account. </li><li>  The user receives a free access to the network in case of ordering services through a partner service. </li></ul><br>  In fact, we are talking about the transformation of PPS models towards the transfer of premiums to the user and obtaining a zero price of basic value.  Today, this model of loyalty is declared by the company - <a href="http://comfortway.ru/">ComfortWay</a> , which positions itself as PaaS MVNA (Mobile Virtual Network Aggregators - a specialized provider of RSP and partner services) and unites mobile operators, users and service partners.  In the model of colleagues, each partner can participate in PPS and revenue sharing from the sale of their SIM card and traffic.  All partner prizes will be returned to the user ID. <br><br>  What is loyalty 2.0 <br><ul><li>  Background discount </li><li>  The basis of additional values ‚Äã‚Äãfor the client </li><li>  Zero price for key service </li><li>  Worlds integration </li><li>  Niche programs </li></ul><br>  - this is a hypothesis and positive consumption for you! <br><br>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/evseyfaydo/topics/">Previous materials of the author</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/303294/">https://habr.com/ru/post/303294/</a></p>
