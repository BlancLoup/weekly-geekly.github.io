Nevertheless, much can be obtained due to leaks.  According to PLUS Journal, Apple recently received a patent for the method of cross-platform data synchronization, which will become possible thanks to the NFC chip. <br>  Apple once again finds itself in the role of a catch-up - Samsung, HTC, Sony and LG have long been installing NFC chips in their smartphones.  Therefore, we are looking forward to the presentation of the iPhone 5S and the vision of the mobile payment market from a company from Cupertino. <br><br><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/deb/f1f/eb5/debf1feb5a28338e412fbd37793f91da.png"><h5>  Finnish startup Uniqul introduced biometric payments using a person </h5><br>  Just look at the camera so that the system developed by Uniqul recognizes you and debits the purchase money from your personal account.  At the moment, the accuracy of recognition of the face is at the level of 96% and work to improve performance continues, according to Business Information Network. <br>  Unfortunately, the demo does not show how the system copes with the recognition of twins.  Well, when entering the Russian market, Uniqul should think about how to recognize a person who came after a hectic weekend over a bottle of mineral water. <br><br><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/faf/9ed/fef/faf9edfef6e932cd520ffe5545e279de.png"><h5>  The British company Zapp began cooperation with Oracle </h5><br>  The newly created Zapp plans to provide the British with a new way of mobile payments next year, writes Payspace Magazine.  Together with Oracle, a platform will be created for making payments through a special application to which all bank accounts of the user will be linked.  The concept is in many ways similar to Paypal's popular and reliable payment system, so for now there is nothing unique in the Zapp offer.  It is hoped that Zapp understands this perfectly well and deliberately does not reveal all the secrets until the official release of their payment system. <br><br><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3c8/48e/33e/3c848e33e1b76cd8e935990d6e2afc2f.png"><h5>  Net Element has signed a preliminary purchase agreement for Quickpay </h5><br>  Net Element International has acquired the Russian payment system Quickpay, which will be managed by TOT Group, a subsidiary of Net Element.  Russia, according to Oleg Firer, CEO of Net Element, provides tremendous opportunities for further development - out of 4 billion cash payments, most of it is carried out in banks and post offices, with huge queues and a lot of wasted time. <br>  The TOT Group strategy has not been disclosed yet, but the company will have to make a lot of effort, since the Quickpay payment system is not particularly popular in Russia. <br><br><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/55a/0d3/f51/55a0d3f510eb407c911ad3078838af79.png"><h5>  Yandex.Money issue bank cards with PayPass support </h5><br>  On July 23, Yandex starts issuing MasterCard PayPass bankcards.  The technology is not new, its history began in 2003, but PayPass is only gaining momentum in Russia.  The main feature of the card is a special chip, making it possible to pay for purchases with one touch of the card, a smartphone with an NFC chip, or even a wristwatch.  It seems that soon we will stop carrying keys, money, cards and passports with us - all this will be replaced by a mobile phone with a programmed chip.  But there is also a fly in the ointment - similar systems today can be easily cracked with a $ 50 reader on hand with eBay. <br><br><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b96/b43/012/b96b43012bcc9b72826a5462bb245f71.png"><h5>  Beijing testing NFC on public transport </h5><br>  In the Chinese capital, testing of a public transport fare service using a smartphone has been completed.  In addition to the NFC chip, you need a special SIM card that is tied to a bank account.  The timing of the launch of the project in mass use has not been disclosed.  It seems that this is partly due to a very short list of supported smartphones - THC One, Samsung Galaxy SIII and SIV, and several ZTE and Huawei models. <br><br><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e2b/031/ea6/e2b031ea61015a580f9ee3270df8ad10.png"><h5>  China UnionPay Introduces Mobile Wallet Without NFC Support </h5><br>  China UnionPay, the national payment system of the Middle Kingdom, launched its own mobile wallet for owners of Android and iOS devices.  The system does not yet know how to work with NFC chips, but it allows you to connect not only bank accounts of users, but also discount cards and coupons that are popular in China.  The latter must be presented in the store on the screen of the smartphone to get discounts. <br>  By the way, the decision to add discount cards to the application is quite justified - now they are always at hand and do not take up so much space in the bag. <br><br><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7b7/392/815/7b73928157339e5cd755162e791085bb.png"><h5>  ICICI Bank and Movida become partners in providing mobile services in India </h5><br>  Mobile payment operator Movida has entered into an agreement with ICICI Bank, the largest Indian bank in the private sector, according to which bank customers can make mobile payments through the Movida system.  The project is fully consistent with the developing economy of India: not all Indians have smartphones, so payments are made through a specially designed menu based on USSD commands or through a voice menu when calling the service number. <br><br>  Did you miss something important?
