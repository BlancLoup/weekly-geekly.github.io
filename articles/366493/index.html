  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Package and intermediary: do you need a middleman?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Very often in the comments to our publications we meet questions about the need for a mediator.  For example, some US stores send parcels directly to Russia.  Why do we need a <a href="https://qwintry.com/ru%3F_openstat%3DaGFicmFoYWJyOzs7cG9zdHM">parcel</a> ?  Today we will tell you about it and, of course, we will be happy to answer your new questions in the comments. <br><br>  As an illustrative example, let's take a simple situation: you decided to buy certain goods in an American store.  Suppose this is going to be a popular Amazon.  You chose the goods for a long time, settled on 15 items. <br><br> <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/banderolka/blog/262886/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4f0/a82/e67/4f0a82e672efe1190f10379a09c05d14.jpg"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  <font color="ff8300">Where to deliver?</font> </h2><br>  Here you will find the first surprise.  Yes, Amazon sometimes offers direct delivery to Russia, but not all products.  And there may well be a situation in which 10 goods can be sent to you, and the remaining 5 - not.  What to do? 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

      <br>
      This is where the <a href="https://qwintry.com/ru%3F_openstat%3DaGFicmFoYWJyOzs7cG9zdHM">Banderolkin service</a> comes in handy.  As a rule, delivery is free for the USA, the incoming parcels are free at the Parcel Post, so here you absolutely do not lose anything.  Moreover, having received the goods in your account, you can immediately check it for integrity, compliance with the order, size and many other parameters with the help of <a href="https://qwintry.com/ru/articles/special_requests%3F_openstat%3DaGFicmFoYWJyOzs7cG9zdHM">special queries</a> .  It is much more convenient, easier and cheaper than getting the goods in Russia and finding that the seller or a few of them were wrong. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/95e/44e/cc8/95e44ecc87828fde62ce3c7938daa06f.jpg"></div><br>  And sending the goods with the help of a parcel is quite simple: choose the Qwintry Air method if there is electronics or fragile goods in the package, USPS Priority (Russian Post) or USPS Express (EMS), if the package is mostly clothing, or EcoPost is our new method delivery, which is cheaper than all of the above - we deliver the package to Germany on our own, approximately as in the Qwintry Air method, and then we transfer it to the Post of Russia. <br><br>  By the way, all delivery options with Russian Post are monitored by tracking, and the prices are exactly the same as on the official USPS website (at EcoPost they are even lower).  Yes, we do not charge any prices, as we buy USPS services in bulk and ‚Äúsell‚Äù at a retail price.  Therefore, for you to send a parcel with the help of a Parcel Post, it means almost the same thing as asking, say, your American friend to do it, except that the packaging will be much better (we stuffed our hands on this!). <br><br>  But the most important thing is that all your numerous purchases will be sent in one package, which, you see, is much more profitable than paying for the packaging and delivery of each item separately. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/35c/16b/187/35c16b187b05c1364842b7dca382ee6d.jpg"></div><br><br><h2>  <font color="ff8300">How to deliver?</font> </h2><br>  But it may be that Amazon can send all your selected products to Russia on its own.  It would seem - hurray!  And the mediator is not needed, and time will be saved a little.  But here you can expect another underwater stone: Amazon has dozens of warehouses and as many as six Fulfilment Centers throughout the US.  Where exactly is your chosen product? <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b20/e7b/26d/b20e7b26d11435185a59e8567bbb5b27.png"></div><br><br>  Well, if your orders are in one such center - in this case, they will be collected in one parcel and sent.  Everything is simple here.  And if in different?  Then they will be collected in different parcels.  Moreover, Amazon does everything automatically and, in fact, does not understand very well who is sending the parcel and where.  He sees only the client and delivery address.  Any product will arrive only tomorrow?  Well, Amazon will not wait and today will send all that is, and tomorrow will collect another package. <br><br>  And here we do not consider the situation when the goods are sold on Amazon, but physically located in stores or in the warehouses of sellers.  In this case, expect them in one package certainly not worth it. <br><br>  Of course, Amazon offers to group all purchases, but promises to do it only if it is available. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a3c/03e/0b3/a3c03e0b367ebf300c5909fa25f76938.png"><br><br>  Here again Banderolk helps: agree, it's easier to wait for all the parcels in our warehouse, pack them in one and send them in a convenient way, rather than waiting for them all to get to you at different unpredictable times. <br><br><h2>  <font color="ff8300">What to deliver?</font> </h2><br>  Another question we partially answered above.  Banderolka offers such delivery methods as USPS, Qwintry Air and EcoPost. <br><br>  Amazon, as a rule, uses either USPS or commercial services - UPS, FedEx or DHL Express.  The disadvantages in these cases are obvious: the packages are not packaged perfectly and in the case of USPS (and, consequently, Russian Post), there is a great chance to get at least a torn box, and at worst - a package without goods. <br><br>  For commercial postal services, packaging is no longer so critical, but there is one unpleasant feature: when the cost of goods exceeds 200 euros, customs clearance is necessary.  In general, there is nothing terrible here, but you have to be nervous and hurry up.  An example of such a design <a href="http://geektimes.ru/post/209418/">has already been</a> on the pages of Geektimes. <br><br>  In the case of the Banderolka, both questions are resolved: packaging is better a priori, because this is the basis of our work.  With customs clearance, everything is much simpler: 1000 euros and 31 kg per individual person per month.  Yes, for Qwintry Air, even before sending a parcel, it is necessary to fill in a detailed declaration, but, you see, it is much easier to specify the name of the product, the article on the seller‚Äôs website and the seller‚Äôs website itself, rather than search for the TN VED codes of the vehicle and the notification number. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/92d/b69/164/92db69164c5a5a953ba4eadd59981011.png"><br><br>  In general, an intermediary is very convenient and quite inexpensive.  In the case of the Parcel Post, this can be even much cheaper than direct shipments. <br><br>  Does it always work as we described above?  No not always.  Sometimes sellers offer very reasonable shipping prices, especially if it is some very small product.  And in this case, we always say: choose the delivery that is more profitable for you.  But such cases are not common and they concern such things as covers, headphones, chargers for mobile phones or tablets, etc.  If the goods are slightly larger and more expensive, then an intermediary would be a more suitable option.  And if there are several such goods, then even more so. <br><br>  In one of the following articles, we will describe how the inside of the Banderolk works.  You'll like it :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/366493/">https://habr.com/ru/post/366493/</a></p>
