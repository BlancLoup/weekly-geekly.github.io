      The retail price of all presented notebook models will be the same as in similar configurations without a built-in Mobile WiMAX. <br><br>  <b>Also, at an event for the press and partners, which took place yesterday, Denis Sverdlov announced a reduction in the price of the HTC MAX 4G phone to 24,900 rubles.</b> <br><br>  UPD: mistaken for a thousand - the cost of the NTS has now become 24,900, not 25,900, as it wrote yesterday. <br><br>  Under the cut quotes speakers. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  ‚ÄúIntel Corporation considers the spread of WiMAX networks in all countries of the world to be one of its most important tasks - this is how most users can be provided with free communication and access to information on the World Wide Web,‚Äù says <b>Dmitry Konash, Intel Regional Director in Russia</b> and other CIS countries.  - It's nice that Yota responded so quickly to our initiatives and is already offering mobile access to its 4G networks in St. Petersburg and Moscow.  Now the leading manufacturers of laptops have released new models of laptops and netbooks with integrated Intel WiMAX / Wi-Fi adapters.  This gives the user the freedom to choose a complete mobile solution. ‚Äù <br><br>  ‚ÄúOn all laptops with integrated Mobile WiMAX support, software for connecting to the Yota network is already preinstalled.  Moreover, any WiMAX-compatible laptop based on an Intel processor, wherever it is purchased, will also be able to connect to our network, ‚Äùsaid <b>Denis Sverdlov, CEO of Yota</b> .  - We are open to all and are confident that the launch of 4G Internet on the mass market will lead to a change in the consumption model.  When technology enters life, brand names become the names of new concepts.  We will try to use one more new word in our everyday life - ‚Äújoke‚Äù.  This verb will denote a new model of consumption of Internet services.  Thanks to our reliable partners, this will become a reality. ‚Äù <br><br>  ‚ÄúAcer strives to make the mobile Internet more attractive and affordable for everyone, and is pleased to introduce new portable devices equipped with the latest Intel-based WiMAX technology on the Russian market,‚Äù said Grigory Nizovsky, Acer CIS Inc. Commercial Director.  ‚ÄúThis is the Aspire One netbook in a 10-inch form factor, as well as two newest models of full-featured laptops ‚Äî the Aspire 3810T and the multimedia Aspire 5738.‚Äù <br><br>  ‚ÄúToday, Samsung is presenting a wide range of mobile solutions with integrated support for the revolutionary Mobile WiMAX wireless standard,‚Äù said <b>Lim Sun Hon, CEO of Samsung Electronics Rus Company</b> .  - A month ago, we successfully launched the first Samsung NC10 4G mini-laptop in the Russian market with an integrated WiMAX module, the success of which is confirmed by good and stable sales volumes.  Therefore, we decided to expand the line of laptops that will be equipped with Intel's integrated WiMAX module. ‚Äù <br><br>  ‚ÄúLenovo is always committed to providing consumers with the most advanced and most advanced solutions to which we also include WiMAX technology,‚Äù comments <b>Denis Reshin, CEO of Lenovo Eastern Europe / Asia</b> .  - Moreover, in our opinion, by 2010 WiMAX will become a standard component in the configuration of modern laptops.  This year we have already implemented WiMAX-access to the Internet in 9 models of the IdeaPad and ThinkPad series of laptops, which will allow our customers to be in contact with each other in any place and at any time. ‚Äù <br><br>  ‚ÄúWe are happy to provide our netbooks for such a revolutionary service as the Yota network using Mobile WiMAX technology,‚Äù says <b>Dmitry Lukin, Technical Director, ASUS Mobile Department</b> .  - Previously, only 11% of users were ready to purchase netbooks as a replacement for desktops and high-performance laptops.  After the appearance of the service Yota, the number of such users, I am sure, will increase.  In addition to netbooks, we are releasing 5 notebook models for Yota service, but we plan to significantly expand this line, since the 4G project has good prospects. <br><br>  ‚ÄúAdvanced technology dictates fashion!  - sure <b>Kevin Young, head of the Russian representative office of the company MSI.</b>  ‚ÄúToday, a laptop is an essential attribute in the life of mobile people, and the most important role in choosing a compact assistant is the support of wireless technologies.  MSI believes that WiMAX technology will have unprecedented success.  This is a project of the future, which will raise the mobile Internet in Russia to a new level.  That is why MSI launched notebooks that fully support modern Yota Internet services.  These are models from different series equipped with WiMAX-adapter.  In the near future, we plan to expand the range of laptops with support for WiMAX. " <br><br>  ‚ÄúWhen developing laptops, Toshiba strives to provide users with maximum mobility,‚Äù said <b>Igor Snytko, general manager for CIS and Baltic countries, Toshiba Europe GmbH</b> .  - Now this concept has ceased to be limited to only compact size.  Being mobile means always staying in touch and having access to the necessary information.  We are sure that thanks to the implementation of the 4G standard, our users will receive a new level of freedom of action.  Now we are introducing two models with Mobile WiMAX support.  In the future, Toshiba plans to equip Mobile WiMAX modules and laptops with the Satellite mass line. ‚Äù </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/58095/">https://habr.com/ru/post/58095/</a></p>
