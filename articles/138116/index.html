After all, this function is very much in demand, I think everyone faced a situation when you need to perform a simple operation (adjust the volume or switch the channel), and go to the TV is lazy or more complex, for example, turn off the sound, but the console disappeared where it is unknown, and then the quest begins . <a name="habracut"></a>  View next to the sofa on the left, right, under him, raise the pillows.  If at a distance of an outstretched hand, the console does not turn out, walking around the room and scanning the room with a glance at the presence of a piece of plastic with buttons begins.  Then begins turning over everything, under what may be the remote, and so on, everyone can write a sequel himself.  But it would seem that the simplest thing is to stick the receiver + squeaker into the remote, add 1 button on the case.  But it is clear to the producers that this idea hasn‚Äôt occurred in the head for years.  And I, as a student of a pedagogical university, did not bother with the implementation of the idea and stubbornly continued to look for the console under the pillows. <br><br>  Last year, I was convinced that the thought is material, or the planet has an information field - the manufacturer Supra releases the STV-LC3225AWL model with the remote control search function:

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/baa/4be/4d7/baa4be4d7bc0b0c88f0f9cd75dff9195.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The TV turned out to be rather mediocre in performance.  Of course, I have no doubt that the manufacturer will continue to produce TVs with this feature, but my beloved Philips and Samsung have not yet pleased with their decisions.  Perhaps Supra has patented this feature, I do not know.  In general, I decided to make myself a piece to search for the remote, but because  I do not have a technical education and hardly distinguish a transistor from a resistor, then I decided to use Chinese stores with ready-made solutions such as ‚ÄúPress a button - squeak‚Äù. <br><br>  The first idea was a penny - a <a href="http://www.buyincoins.com/details/whistle-led-light-anti-theft-anti-lost-alarm-keychain-product-1996.html">keychain that responds to a $ 1.20 whistle</a> : <br><br><img src="http://www.otherlandtoys.co.uk/product_thumb.php?img=images//key750.jpg&amp;w=350&amp;h=124&amp;ow=350&amp;oh=200" alt="image"><br><br>  As it turned out, he also happily responds to claps, shouts and other loud noises.  The idea is cheap, but it is a bit not what I wanted to realize: firstly, the key chain squeaked when it was not required, secondly, searching the console at night was impossible, you won‚Äôt scream in the middle of the night. <br><br>  The second idea came after on the website of one of the Chinese stores I saw another <a href="http://www.buyincoins.com/details/25m-wireless-finder-reminder-find-lost-keys-alarm-purse-product-6728.html">device for finding keys worth about $ 10</a> .  It was a plastic, about the size of a bank card, about two millimeters thick: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/078/48a/957/07848a957f10ced672ff950aac5df294.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  On the one hand, two CR2016 3V tablet batteries are inserted, on the other hand, the search button is located.  The keychain-squeaker is a pear-shaped piece of plastic with a metal ring, there is a recessed ON / OFF switch on the side (you won't be able to switch it accidentally): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/afd/f10/b33/afdf10b330a8a95bdb20320f684a37fa.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Having examined the key chain, I found a rather small piece of PCB, on one side a CR2032 3V battery was attached to it, on the other hand a squeaker: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/838/713/38b/83871338b7819b353e7b54b93bdc7332.jpg" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7b6/e93/cdb/7b6e93cdbc6e2fb55648fe8c394a8dd6.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Further there were two options: <br><br>  1) Simple: shove this design into the console and for a certain time enjoy searching the console with a card that can be put, or better glued to the TV (preferably on the back panel).  When the battery and the keychain sit down - disassemble the remote and change the battery. <br>  2) Difficult: since the key fob is powered by 3V and the remote uses two AA or AAA batteries, then connect to the remote control batteries.  They are easier to change, no need to disassemble the remote. <br><br>  From the photo you can see that if you remove the compartment for the CR2032, then this microcircuit can be pushed into almost any remote control, it is very thin, and the squeaker hangs on the wires and it is possible to place it elsewhere in the control: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/af3/6c0/357/af36c0357abc4c5eff58e558f9829a64.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  I think habrovchane do not need instructions for removing the compartment for the CR2032 and connecting the power from the remote control.  Also, I will not now implant this design into the console, because  the remote that I have is not mine, like the TV (we rent an apartment), but I sincerely hope that this topic will be useful to people who are tired of the quest to search for the console, and which option to use, simple or complex, everyone will decide for themselves myself. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/138116/">https://habr.com/ru/post/138116/</a></p>
