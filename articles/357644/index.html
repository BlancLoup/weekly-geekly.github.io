      Watercolor is simple and accessible to everyone.  Paper, a few brushes, water and a set of colors - that's all you need to get started. <br><br>  The main features of watercolors are the transparency of the paint, the absence of white color and the effect of unique color mixing.  The transparency of the paint does not allow us to correct parts of the picture that have already been written, and the lack of white color makes the artist go to the trick and use the natural color of the paper instead of paint.  All this leads to the fact that drawing with watercolors requires careful pre-planning of the composition of the work, and the process of writing a picture requires a high concentration of attention - one wrong brush stroke - and now the paint has spread throughout the whole picture or has got out beyond the frame assigned to it by the artist. <br><br>  Watercolor requires patience.  Before you start drawing small parts, you must wait until the previous layer dries as much as is necessary to obtain the artist's intended effect of mixing colors.  For a beginner, watercolor is unpredictable: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f46/989/596/f46989596d3d4595bfc3811dec7d2c30.jpg"><br><br>  However, having mastered the real mastery of watercolor, the artist will receive from his works an incomparable feeling of lightness, air, light and color;  let it take years of hard training. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/69c/8ee/190/69c8ee19035c4c659f0a367753f9e502.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Oil Paints - Java</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/050/c05/6b8/050c056b8d79493daae035fc28412e02.jpg"><br><br>  Oil painting is a real mainstream among artists.  A distinctive feature of this type of painting is the ability to repaint any part of the painting canvas beyond recognition.  The choice of oil paints gives a guarantee that the product will not be spoiled so that it would have to be thrown away.  All this allows the artist to create with oil such huge paintings that would not be realizable when choosing other types of painting.  Oil painting is one of the most profitable types of painting for the artist;  and, in fact, the availability of oil paints for the population is on average. <br><br>  <b>Gouache - Pascal</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/04f/403/3d5/04f4033d5a8e4c66a2e97ba0dad7b658.jpg"><br><br>  A kind of painting, the flourishing and decay of which has already ended, and all this was once upon a time in the 20th century.  Now it is used mainly in schools in drawing lessons. <br><br>  <b>Application - Basic</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/439/ba8/e9a/439ba8e9a9d94671880a1542071b92bd.jpg"><br><br>  Technically simple method of fine art, is used like gouache mainly in schools in drawing lessons. <br><br>  A true artist can create with anything, and one should not condemn those who find their inspiration here. <br><br>  <b>Simple pencil - Assembler</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/68d/a3d/4e2/68da3d4e290f4f4f82d99338d01f5e81.jpg"><br><br>  Minimalistic set of tools - paper, pencil and eraser;  black and white color palette.  Basically, the matter is limited to drawing the simplest geometric shapes, but drawing something more complex is difficult. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a32/96b/8aa/a3296b8aab204553868cee52e79fe261.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Pen - Perl</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/680/2a4/ad0/6802a4ad0339406088b38a65b930dc03.jpg"><br><br>  ‚ÄúIt is written with a pen ‚Äî you cannot cut it down with an ax‚Äù ‚Äîthe main thing here is wisdom and philosophy.  Another distinctive feature is that the drawing with a pen has its own unique and memorable smell. <br><br>  Somewhere they say that there are real masters of the genre: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d27/e09/228/d27e092286054e81a84933c7a854d62e.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Crayons on asphalt - PHP</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f6e/b11/a73/f6eb11a73dfb4aeb80cf7fd5fb8d7293.jpg"><br><br>  A form of creativity that is accessible to everyone, even a child.  Popular with children, but with age, interest in the chalk passes.  The piece is drawn quickly;  beautiful is not beautiful, and crayons fulfill their task for children. <br><br>  <b>Markers - Python</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/be0/153/af5/be0153af59bb4fb48e1ee24ca419fce9.jpg"><br><br>  A relatively new invention in painting.  People are attracted here by the brightness of colors and ease of use.  When using colorings is achieved incredible drawing speed.  Some might say that <br>  creativity is killed and the line between amateur and professional disappears, and the markers themselves cease to be <br>  kind of serious art, but in fact all this is too subjective to raise any controversy on this topic. <br><br>  <b>Pastel - Ruby</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/107/42b/7b9/10742b7b9cc9457b827174ec36c03034.jpg"><br><br>  Bright colours.  The more you use crayons from the finished set, the faster the creativity;  it is easier to take an extra set of crayons of different shades than to mix the colors yourself. <br><br>  <b>Water Soluble Pencils - C #</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f44/6be/0a2/f446be0a25744b53835ca399ff76e7f4.jpg"><br><br>  Attempt to achieve the ease of watercolor through the use of water-soluble pencils.  Unfortunately, there are not so many manufacturers of water-soluble pencils, and pencils themselves are not available everywhere. <br><br>  <b>Enamel - Objective-C</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f5e/2b0/95e/f5e2b095e6344b448257c9a0df3f13ef.jpg"><br><br>  Creativity requires special techniques and materials.  Artwork with enamel is often decorated with precious stones.  The bottom line: objectively beautiful, but not accessible to the masses. <br><br>  <b>Non-standard watercolor techniques - C ++</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/69b/de9/8e0/69bde98e09214cc7ade7b748cefab3ee.jpg"><br><br>  When inspiration is pumped when painting with watercolor, the artist begins to search for and use non-standard and perverted drawing techniques, for example, use gouache to get white, sprinkle salt and sugar on paper to get the desired texture, use sponges, toothbrushes, cut paper, and rump it with sandpaper etc. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/578/a80/0d7/578a800d7c5c408dbdc433bb6da8ffb1.jpg"><br><br>  Basically, the reason for these deviations is the lack of mastery of watercolor;  and should caution beginner artists from following this slippery slope. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b28/8af/331/b288af331778424b97b753c77eec73c9.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Graffiti - JavaScript</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c5d/59b/e69/c5d59be6941748a8ae9669723d486df7.jpg"><br><br>  Graffiti is a new, yet not universally recognized, trend in art.  With proper skill goes <br>  beautiful and tasteful.  In the hands of a layman ceases to be art. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4b2/3d1/52b/4b23d152b5a544aaa683be9002639ba0.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Graffiti on paper - Haskell</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3d3/b69/873/3d3b69873886421591a4369771805ea2.jpg"><br><br>  The drawing technique first introduces a novice artist into a stupor, and then you quickly get used to it. <br><br>  <b>Japanese crossword - Lua</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8f7/09f/d85/8f709fd85b654938a47079a933581f2f.png"><br><br>  Limited imagination for creativity;  the rules are simple, the crossword itself is more a puzzle than an art. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/357644/">https://habr.com/ru/post/357644/</a></p>
