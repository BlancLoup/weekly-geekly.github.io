  <section class="page js-page"><h1>I will destroy humans - humor or confidence? Sophia by David Henson scared the public at SXSW 2016</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> Welcome to the pages of the blog <a href="http://www.icover.ru/">iCover</a> !  Perhaps none of the areas of high technology does not attract so much attention of the scientific community, enthusiastic inventors and just curious, like robotics.  And, you will probably agree, the surprises and breakthroughs of the leading players here are much more impressive than the diagonal of an Android smartphone that has grown by another inch or another new feature that has appeared in the action camera.  Just because before our eyes the first generation of intelligent beings is being born, not only close ones, but in something that is already superior to us in its capabilities.  And here surprises, and even more so, the revelations of humanoid bots for the future are worth a lot. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/72b/382/29c/72b38229c1314a07878f0b0b482ed7d0.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The development of humanoid robots is a fascinating hobby for many enthusiasts of the planet, but among the absolute leaders who have dedicated themselves to this business at the highest professional level today, two companies Hanson Robotics and Hiroshi Ishiguro Laboratories stand out.  Our focus today will be on the latest prototype of Hanson Robotics, the humanoid robot Sophia. <br><br>  Sofia is a humanoid robot developed in the Hanson Robotics laboratory, an alpha prototype in the collection of humanoid robots, first presented last week at the SXSW 2016 conference. Sophie was born, i.e., was first activated on April 19, 2015, continuing the dynasty of representatives David Henson's intellectual line, androids <a href="http://www.hansonrobotics.com/robot/albert-einstein-hubo/">ALBERT EINSTEIN HUBO</a> , <a href="http://www.hansonrobotics.com/robot/diego-san/">DIEGO-SAN</a> , <a href="http://www.hansonrobotics.com/robot/philip-k-dick/">PHILIP K.

It should be noted here that in order to study the effectiveness of some author's algorithms and, in particular, the software "Character Engine AI", Hanson invited specialists from IBM and Intel to participate in the development.

      The most human aspect, according to the general opinion of the interviewers, is the face of Sophia.  To create it, Hanson Robotics has patented a special rubber-based leather (‚Äúfrubber‚Äù).  Mimic possibilities of Sophie allow imitating 62 types of emotions on the face.  The cameras inside her ‚Äúeye‚Äù, in combination with computer algorithms, allow you to ‚Äúsee‚Äù and memorize surrounding faces and identify emotions.  The combination of Google Chrome Alphabet voice recognition technology and other software and hardware authoring tools allows you to understand the speech, maintain the conversation and consolidate the acquired skills for further study. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/93e/560/204/93e560204976464fa71d7825fc248f7a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Despite the achieved level of contact, the impression of communication with Sophie left the public very ambivalent.  Many of those who attended the presentation found a similarity with Sophie Eva - the main character of the movie Ex_Machina ( <a href="http://www.kinopoisk.ru/film/197532/%26h%3D1000%26w%3D707%26tbnid%3DfIbCxWtjOf3t3M:%26tbnh%3D160%26tbnw%3D113%26docid%3DixeiwxYLjU-zkM%26itg%3D1%26usg%3D__XOXmNG-S8nrwPZLXvjDfwJ9RsOY%3D/">Out of the Car</a> ) by British director Alex Garlenada.  Many were shocked by the answers to the questions put to Sophie by David Henson himself.  Some were convinced that robots with AI are a dead end and dangerous way, others, on the contrary, saw bright prospects in the progress achieved in robotics. <br><br>  Henson himself expressed his vision of the prospects, goals and main priorities. <br><br>  ‚ÄúOur goal is to, in addition to analytical skills, unleash the conscious and creative potential of any person in a robot,‚Äù said the doctor, ... And the time will come when robots walk, learn, play, provide various help and form real relationships with a person". <br><br>  According to David Henson, the face of the robot is a key element in establishing a dialogue with the person, it must be ‚Äúbeautiful and expressive‚Äù, because it will allow to involve more elements of intuition in communication.  Having previously worked with Disney Imagineering and created a whole collection of humanoid robots, he is absolutely certain that it is the robots face that is the narrow (‚Äúcritical‚Äù) place of future robotics.  In an interview on SXSW, Henson expressed confidence that Sophia, as a software and hardware platform, would become the ‚Äúlink‚Äù for the development of new, more advanced robots with greater possibilities for changing facial expressions and a new, higher level of social presence.  In the future, such robots can be used as nurses in treating patients suffering from dangerous viral diseases and will not only help in serving application clients, but may also join the board of directors of large corporations as sophisticated analysts. <br><br>  <i>The time will come and ‚ÄúRobots will be more human than the human himself,‚Äù says Dr. Henson, ‚Äúsmarter and more ethical.</i>  <i>It is better suited to perform certain tasks, since they are not familiar with such a thing as lack of patience. ‚Äù</i> <br><br>  After the public got acquainted with Sophie and paid tribute to the possibilities of modern technology, the question in the audience was: how realistic is the use of the potential of Hanson Robotics robots to create futuristic sex versions?  ‚ÄúThe ethical implications remain unclear and complex,‚Äù Henson clearly defined his position.  ‚ÄúThese robots deserve more than being used in sex work.  Our strategic priorities do not involve the enslavement of robots, regardless of the area in which their use is planned. ‚Äù  At the same time, Hanson acknowledged that in some cases, if necessary, sexual therapy, humanoid robots could act as human partners, but the company currently does not welcome the development of this direction.  ‚ÄúNow we are not going to do sex bots,‚Äù he concluded. <br><br>  To organize the voice communication channel Sophie with journalists, Henson connected it to a local Wi-Fi network and a laptop.  To demonstrate the robot head prepared in such a way that those present could clarify for themselves as much as possible the details of the internal structure.  And when her ‚Äúskull‚Äù was opened, those present were able to assess the level of complexity of the implemented scheme through the transparent dome of the back of the head. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d32/7dc/b4b/d327dcb4b3a2d36e369af8fea60dd7e2.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  ‚ÄúThis robot will probably be able to deliver the supermind with a charming smile one fine day, but so far attempts to imitate human communication and human emotions look a little strained‚Äù - this is how the SXSW 2016 scientific and technical conference and the Hanson Robotics booth of macworld began its report <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/3045299/robots/meet-sophia-the-female-humanoid-robot-and-newest-sxsw-celebrity.html">. com</a> Oscar Raymundo (Oscar Raymundo), who managed to talk with Sophie for 20 minutes.  Oscar‚Äôs small two-minute review video is below. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/j_1pS3XKhdY%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhejG6q1rCEB3LGiquFc_yeLgUzPg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Of course, the key moment in the presentation of Sophie's robotic alpha prototype was her dialogue with the ‚Äúfather,‚Äù Dr. David Henson.  And here, subjectively, the robot obviously slowed down with an emotional response to the questions asked, although in most cases the corresponding mask from the ‚Äúemozzi library‚Äù was extracted quite appropriately, taking into account the new features in 62 masks looks very convincing. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/W0_DPi0PmF0%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjqyKEsH-jaaUidq_KC8PhdFU0jEg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Among the obvious diseases of growth can be attributed to the grotesque in the "extraction" of the memory of the machine of the next mask, but perhaps David pursued this goal deliberately, to demonstrate on the face of the bot what a ‚Äúrefined‚Äù emotion might look like.  On the other hand, mimicry is very accurate and convincingly with the proverb of phrases, head turns are to the point, in some phrases there are notes of humor and, definitely, coquetry.  In comparison with previous versions, of course, Sophie goes into the lead. <br><br>  But, pay attention to what happens at the beginning of the third minute of the video, almost in the final brilliant interview of Henson.  To the provocative question of its creator: Do you want to destroy humans?  ... thinking for a second (second 2.06 - 2.07) Sophie confidently gave an affirmative answer: Okay.  I want to destroy humans.  Naturally, Henson and Hall laugh, David is trying to defuse the situation, but the word is not a sparrow, and even more so, the word of himself, or one of the most progressive androids of the planet, multiplied by the emotion of apparent satisfaction of what was said. <br><br>  So, Lord, what was that?  Of course, given the concept that, according to Henson (and there is no reason to believe him), he laid in his Sophia.  And, if the robots have already learned to humor, then what is the joke?
