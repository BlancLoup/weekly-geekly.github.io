They help ensure the efficiency of the code that we write in various technological environments, people with different capabilities, <nobr>and most importantly -</nobr> in all browsers. <br><br>  But nevertheless, how often do we all feel that our voices, our proposals and ideas are heard by the groups that are responsible for adopting these standards?  In fact, although many of us would like to see some changes, lack of time and long formalities prevent us from contributing to the discussion of standards, involvement in writing specifications, and participating in meetings about future features.  This is what hampers the web developers' right to vote.

Browser providers are very active in all of these lists, and in most of the discussion threads, a huge amount of internal basic knowledge is assumed.  Browser builders usually have a place to confer and discuss problem areas of interest to them, and web developers won't do that, except for occasional meetings at conferences. <br><br>  The jQuery project intends to change these circumstances: we want you to have the right to vote in choosing the form that the future of the Web takes. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><h2>  The jQuery Standards Team </h2><br>  The jQuer Standardization Group has three main objectives: <br><br><ul><li>  Be representatives of the web development community (especially jQuery consumers) on standardization committees (such as W3C and TC39) with the intention to improve existing and emerging standards to better fit their web development needs. <br></li><li>  Be representatives of the web development community (and especially jQuery consumers) in front of browser builders, with the intention of helping browser builders in choosing the standards that need to be implemented first, and in making <i>proofs of concept.</i> <br></li><li>  To help the jQuery project to assimilate new standards and browser innovations properly. </li></ul><br>  This is a milestone of great changes in the power of feedback and the impact of the web development community on standardization committees and on the standards themselves.  By lowering the threshold of entry, which hinders proposals and objections to existing implementations of standards to be heard, we hope to encourage more developers to interact with standardizers to ensure that browser creators participate in this process. <br><br>  The jQuery team will be managed by the members of the jQuery team - Judah Katz and Paul Irish.  Jude and Paul have actively interacted with standardization committees and browser vendors in a given role for many years, and their personal work at SproutCore and Chrome Developer Relations provides them with additional perspectives that will prove useful in defending community opinion. <br><br> <a href="https://github.com/jquery/standards"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/72e/9ca/7d3/72e9ca7d32cb5844a23bb99706252bc9.jpg"></a> <br><br>  Perhaps you are wondering why our group has earned the honor to represent the interests of the wider web development community.  Since jQuery is used by a significant percentage of sites <nobr>(</nobr> <a href="https://twitter.com/">more than 50%</a> from 10,000 high-rating sites), we feel well about what problems and challenges one usually encounters, what difficulties of existing implementations have to be circumvented.  Since jQuery is very focused on manipulating DOM, our library always serves as a good source of information about known problems in implementations and the current best ways to solve them. <br><br>  Although the current group consists mainly of jQuery development participants, we would like to involve as many web developers as possible in this group with a genuine interest in standards and specifications.  By the end of the day <i>(October 24, 2011),</i> our group intends to assist in identifying web developers who are interested in the process, and to provide all of us with a forum for the interchange of issues, ideas, areas of interest.  We believe that our work together can help all of us in improving the Web. <br><br><h2>  Taking part </h2><br>  If you are interested in taking part in the work of the jQuer Standardization Group, the easiest way is to subscribe to a group <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/">in Google Groups</a> .  Following the example of other jQuery development teams, there will be publicly available meetings on the <a href="http://jquery.org/meeting/"><nobr># jquery-meeting</nobr></a> channel <a href="http://jquery.org/meeting/">at freenode</a> (we will inform you later) to discuss what is the most effective way for the group to work in promoting the needs of the web development community. <br><br>  You may have already seen Paul's blog. ‚Äú <a href="http://paulirish.com/2011/what-feature-would-improve-the-web/">What feature would improve the web?</a>  ";  if you left a comment there, you already took <nobr>part;)</nobr> <br><br>  You can also leave messages and comments about problems in standards and specifications using the issue-reporting tool ("Issues") <a href="https://github.com/jquery/standards">in the official repository of our group</a> on Github.  In doing so, try to identify problems in those standards or specifications that either exist or are now being proposed for adoption.  And here is an <a href="https://github.com/jquery/standards/issues/2">excellent example of one of these problems</a> . <br><br>  We wish to collect well-defined, clearly described problems of the Web ecosystem and defend the necessary improvements to standardizers and browser builders.  Real-world problems will be tagged with appropriate labels (for example, ‚ÄúW3C‚Äù, ‚ÄúTC39‚Äù, browser names, <nobr>etc.),</nobr> and sent, wherever and as far as possible, to a suitable committee of standardizers or browser developers ‚Äî so This will not have to take care. <br><br><h2>  Conclusion </h2><br>  By creating such a new forum, we hope to provide the right to vote to millions of web developers who wanted to participate in this process, but did not have the simplest opportunity for that.  Please let us know your views on this group, as we hope to improve it to the utmost.  We look forward to your comments, suggestions and ideas about both the group and the standardization process! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/131363/">https://habr.com/ru/post/131363/</a></p>
