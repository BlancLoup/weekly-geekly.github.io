  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The judges legalized the frequency for "Beeline"</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Two wins at once in the framework of the same dispute with the regulating authorities were won by the mobile operator VimpelCom (the Beeline trademark).  On Tuesday, the Presnensky District Court of Moscow rejected the suit of the Federal Communications Agency (Rossvyaz) against the Federal Antimonopoly Service (FAS), which had previously declared illegal the refusal of VimpelCom to issue frequencies to the Far Eastern enlarged district.  VimpelCom submitted relevant applications to the State Commission for Radio Frequencies dozens of times (SCRF, an interdepartmental body coordinated by Rossvyaz), but none of them were satisfied.  In this regard, the operator filed a complaint with the FAS, which in March supported the operator and <a href="http://www.cnews.ru/news/top/index.shtml%3F2006/03/02/197025">issued the relevant prescription with respect to the SCRF</a> .  Now the legality of this prescription was confirmed by the court. <br><br>  And on Monday, the Moscow Arbitration Court granted a lawsuit filed by VimpelCom itself to the Federal Service for Supervision in the Sphere of Communications (Rossvyaznadzor), which, like Rossvyaz, is subordinate to the Ministry of Information Technologies and Communications.  This lawsuit also related to the situation with the Far Eastern frequencies, however, it dealt with another episode.  Back in 2001, VimpelCom‚Äôs subsidiary, Vostok-Zapad Telecom (VZT), received frequencies in this district, but the corresponding license was not issued to it, as a result of which the operator could not start work in the Far East. <br><br>  For several years, VimpelCom received refusals to issue licenses to work on the Far Eastern frequencies already assigned to it, and the bases for this at various times were various prepositions.  The last time Rossvyaznadzor pointed to the fact that the TVZ, after receiving the Far Eastern frequencies, changed its organizational and legal form from a limited liability company (LLC) to a closed joint-stock company (CJSC), and as a result of this, it lost the right to use these frequencies.  The supervisory service defended this position during the court hearings, however, the court eventually took the side of the operator.

      ‚ÄúWe have repeatedly tried to argue our position with the Rossvyaznadzor in the pretrial order,‚Äù explained VimpelCom CEO Alexander Izosimov.  - The court was the last instance and we are very pleased with its decision in our favor.  We hope that the residents of those regions of the Far East, where we do not work, will soon be able to appreciate all the advantages of the Beeline network. <br><br>  Now, VimpelCom should, firstly, obtain licenses to work in nine Far Eastern regions, in which frequencies have already been assigned to it (there are 13 regions in the Far Eastern District), and secondly, the operator‚Äôs requests for receiving frequencies in the whole county.  However, it may be too early to put an end to the confrontation between VimpelCom and the Ministry of Information Technologies and Communications.  Thus, the head of the ministry, Leonid Reiman, said that after studying the court decisions, they could be appealed. <br><br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/4288/">https://habr.com/ru/post/4288/</a></p>
