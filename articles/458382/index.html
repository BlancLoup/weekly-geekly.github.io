  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Why do we teach this?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Good day to all. <br><br>  When I studied at the first and second year of uni with a degree in Information Security, many of the disciplines in my classmates and I caused a non-illusory fire of the hearth and which seemed to us superfluous.  And now, after some time, I began to realize what, in fact, was the whole point and decided to tell the new generation of Padawans the whole essence of seemingly useless academic disciplines and help to project into real life. <br><br>  PS I will call the disciplines as they sounded in my uni, the names may differ, as well as the curriculums from uni to uni. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So let's go ...

      Non-technical disciplines: <br><br>  <b>Occupational Safety and Health</b> <br><br>  A seemingly primitive discipline devoted to such simple things as environmental standards of the working environment, general safety, the Labor Code and other trifles.  In fact - a very useful discipline in relations with the employer.  Knowledge of this discipline will allow you not to work 24/7 without holidays and weekends.  And it will not allow you to fall in love with your salaries, bonuses, bonuses, and so on. <br><br>  <b>Russian / Ukrainian / Galactic</b> <br><br>  It is also a very useful discipline, because more than half of those who have entered, despite all the exams / exams and other examinations, can write without a mistake except the word "mnu."  Plus, knowledge of this discipline will allow you to properly fill out and execute documents. <br><br>  <b>Foreign language</b> <br><br>  Perhaps I will surprise you, but 95% of the adequate documentation for software and hardware is written in bourgeois language.  It is also more effective to seek help in various English-speaking forums, the community there is a little more adequate and answers in the style of ‚Äúgoogle, s ** co‚Äù, ‚ÄúRTFM‚Äù, etc.  on them almost no. <br><br>  <b>Psychology</b> <br><br>  Simple enough and to some extent even fun discipline.  In sensible learning, it will quickly find a common language with colleagues, partners and inadequate clients (there are a lot of them. A lot of them. Thousands of them), allowing you to determine the approaches to a person by unobtrusive features. <br><br>  <b>Philosophy</b> <br><br>  The level of flaming foci on this discipline sometimes reaches 99%.  It all depends on the topic and degree of inadequacy of the teacher (and he is high in 80% of cases).  I do not know how anyone, but my philosophy teacher was absolutely convinced that without his ‚Äúarchival‚Äù discipline, we would not know any programming, no administration, or anything else.  In real life, on the technical specialty, philosophy is the best simulator for pouring water into notes and documentation.  And so, for common development. <br><br>  <b>Physical Education</b> <br><br>  In real life, it is desirable for a sysadmin to be physically minimally savvy, for racks and equipment boxes weigh a lot, and they usually do not keep full-time movers in companies.  And if the phrase ‚Äúwe need strong administrators‚Äù sounds in the office - you know, your 36-unit counter has arrived and there is no one to bring it to the office.  It is also useful for any enikeam to make it easier to bend into the letter ‚Äúsic‚Äù, crawling under the tables for users.  Programmers need mediocre, but it's better not to run yourself yet. <br><br>  <b>Story</b> <br><br>  see "Philosophy" <br><br>  Regarding technical sciences: <br><br>  <b>Higher mathematics</b> <br><br>  Holivary on the need for mathematics programmers / admins and approximate do not cease for many years.  My own subjective opinion is needed, but not in the form or volume to which it is taught.  The initial goal of Vyshmat is to structure and develop the computer logic in a person, to teach people to think and optimize algorithms, as if he has optimized mathematical expressions.  In fact, it turns out stupid learning existing formulas and algorithms.  And any attempt to calculate the expression in a different way than what is required will be stopped as deliberately incorrect.  In life, the same thing is useful for different game designers (in particular, geometry and trigonometry), programmers of exact processes (simulations, etc., which requires the ability to estimate the final value at least approximately), algorithms, and the rest. <br><br>  <b>Physics</b> <br><br>  Mastham science.  Knowing at least the basic principles will quickly enough to understand any technique.  Particularly useful sections on electricity and, oddly enough, classical mechanics.  It is advisable for programmers to know physics to correctly describe the behavior of physical phenomena when writing programs that simulate these phenomena, game physics, writing software for microcontrollers and low-level software.  Admins and enikeyschiki can apply this knowledge when crafting their own collective farm devices and repair existing ones - levers, buttons, fans in equipment, etc. <br><br>  <b>Discrete Math</b> <br><br>  Yes, it is a separate discipline.  And how much more important, in my opinion, than embroidered.  This is pure logic plus graph theory.  This is a discipline in the continuous connection with any electronics and automation and, in fact, is a mathematical description of them.  Must Have a discipline for electronics, electrician repairmen, low-level programmers, microcontroller programmers and others, allowing you to understand how all the hardware that they deal with works. <br><br>  <b>Probability theory and statistics</b> <br><br>  Boring, obscure, but very necessary discipline.  It would be worthwhile to study it well for all IT professionals, because its understanding allows analyzing risks in business processes and projects quite well, allowing you to more effectively plan deadlines, budgets and other integral elements of doing business in information technology. <br><br>  Highly technical disciplines: <br><br>  <b>Electronics</b> <br><br>  It is an extremely important discipline for low-level programmers, hardware repair technicians, administrators and enikeev, allowing not only to understand and theoretically calculate the work of iron, but also to implement it in practice.  Comes with discrete mathematics (see above). <br><br>  <b>Digital signal processing</b> <br><br>  In essence, it is a radio communication theory, which makes it possible to understand the operation of technology, abstracting a little from iron and switching to the level of signals and pulses.  This includes studying the effects of noise, signal insight, and other near-physical aspects of electronics.  Especially useful for various security analysts, white hackers, radio operators, network engineers and telephonists. <br><br>  <b>Coding Theory</b> <br><br>  Here we study the coding and data compression, the methods of their generation, storage and transmission via communication channels, etc.  Goes side by side with digital signal processing.  Also useful to the above individuals. <br><br>  <b>Computer science</b> <br><br>  It takes place, as a rule, in the first semester.  A very useful discipline in which all kinds of Word eccles are learned.  Many are outraged, they say, "we are all such IT people here, and we are given some kind of a Word here."  But at the same time, 95% of the applicants do not know how to correctly execute reports, drawings, calculations, maintain documentation, etc.  The motto of these gentlemen "space and enter - the basis of the formatting of the document."  Yes ... Therefore, in spite of all its apparent inferiority, this discipline should not be scored - the customer / chief will be only grateful for a well-designed document. <br><br>  There are usually no questions about disciplines like programming, cryptography and other understandable disciplines. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/458382/">https://habr.com/ru/post/458382/</a></p>
