It is quite traditional in technical terms, but at the same time it has a very unusual form factor. <br>  A disclaimer regarding the green carpet, which is present on the KDPV, and in all the other review photographs, I, with your permission, will post to kata. <br>  <i>Disclaimer: it seemed to me that in one of the first days of such a long-awaited spring, the green <s>carpet</s> background should create the right mood :)</i> <br>  <i>Disclaimer2: Yes, this is just a Bluetooth audio system (albeit a high-quality, albeit, in an unusual form factor).</i>  <i>Do not swear strongly, and if you are interested in such things,</i> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><blockquote>  Let the beat go on </blockquote><br><br>  MOBISound is packed in a fairly large, presentable and fairly weighty box, which gives the impression of an expensive and high-quality device.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f8c/aeb/b32/f8caebb32b1949598fbe1fa689374101.jpg"><br><br>  The plastic blister contains an audio system packed in a plastic bag, as well as a USB cable - microUSB, 3.5mm jack-jack and instructions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3d8/6b8/828/3d86b88282e940919e59b8d15ac74285.jpg"><br><br>  MOBISound in folded form is very compact and easy to transport: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0f8/6c8/f70/0f86c8f70cb342cd800073f3b2b3b42c.jpg"><br><br>  Unfolded: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fe6/b3e/5ce/fe6b3e5ce91f4e33b761106b1bcd6aaa.jpg"><br><br>  Please note that the folding and resizing mechanism is made of metal, which is very, very happy.  The device will definitely serve for a long time, and immediately gives the impression of a quality product. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/00b/e1e/8c6/00be1e8c6c544a2c88b5ab89648e1c04.jpg"><br><br>  Connectors and controls are represented by a sliding switch, microUSB connector for charging and a line input. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b66/0a6/d99/b660a6d9914e467bb4194d7ae680ee44.jpg"><br><br>  When connected via Bluetooth, the device can be used as a hands-free, thanks to the built-in microphone.  In the same picture you can see the LED indicator showing the mode of operation of the device. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/45f/cfe/59e/45fcfe59e5f142d9803311e7513ea977.jpg"><br><br>  On the instructions, unfortunately, saved.  Although the grayish leaf, folded four times, is more a tribute to the law on consumer rights than a reasonable necessity. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/139/b24/de2/139b24de2cdb454b9de3117520e65e64.jpg"><br><br>  Internal grooves allow you to secure the device on the tablet.  In addition to playing sound, the speaker system will serve as a stand.  Moreover, due to its considerable weight, and strong "springiness" the tablet will be very reliable. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/103/46d/d5c/10346dd5c29c44189f19b30721e7f8cf.jpg"><br><br>  As in the horizontal: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/647/b12/bec/647b12bece1441419b88abd821149d04.jpg"><br><br>  And vertical orientation: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/991/ee9/fff/991ee9fffe774b93acdd81df99eb6d7b.jpg"><br><br>  Of course, the white trim of the audio system is especially good for the white iPad, but not much worse, it fits any 7-11 "tablet <i>(especially not broken :)</i> , for example, the old Motorola Xoom. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/daf/b0f/175/dafb0f175bdc4456a30423cc0f1a3d50.jpg"><br><br>  The main thing is that the tablet is not too thick, for example, it is no longer possible to fix the Xoom vertically, because in the middle part it is too thick. <br><br>  The device is equipped with a function of NFC, which allows you to pair the device, simply bringing the column to the tablet or smartphone.  Unfortunately, I didn‚Äôt have a device with support for this technology at hand, but this should not be upset. <br>  Pairing in the usual way takes place in one touch.  It is enough to turn on the power to MOBISound, go into the search for Bluetooth devices on the tablet and connect to the device with the simple name ‚ÄúBluetooth‚Äù, you do not need to enter a password. <br><br>  I note that the fourth version of the Bluetooth protocol is used, which makes it possible to count on a very low load for the signal source battery. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8ca/8df/1f7/8ca8df1f7603432596b492fe89a7f15b.png"><br><br>  The sound quality and volume level are at a high enough level.  The manufacturer claims that the audio system is equipped with as many as six speakers.  However, it should be noted the lack of low frequencies. <br>  The claimed power of 6 watts may seem somewhat overstated.  It seems to me that it is about 4 W, however, this is a purely subjective assessment, not confirmed by instrumental measurements. <br><br>  When used as a hands-free no complaints. <br><br>  Of course, it should be noted that the device performs among other things the function of a very stylish stand for the tablet. <br><br>  There is another option to use the device as a super-open headphones, which are located on the neck: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/452/c52/f7d/452c52f7d677cd6c71bf103e78e3c794.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  On the neck MOBISound gives a very good surround sound, but using the device in this way involves some ethical difficulties. <br>  You need to respect someone else's space, and not to climb into it with your playlist. <br><br>  This concept of a portable audio system was first introduced by Sony in the early 2000s.  (unfortunately I find it difficult to name a specific model).  She did not receive wide distribution.  I will risk to assume for the reason sounded above. <br><br>  Also keep in mind that the device can quickly delay the neck, it is very heavy. <br><br>  The MOBISound battery should last for 5-6 hours of battery life, which is quite difficult to check - it will be difficult for me to cut out 5-6 hours during which the device will ‚Äúchop‚Äù to full.  Fully charged device for 3-4 hours. <br><br>  The price of this device in the company Dadzhet at the moment is 4950 rubles, which means 5 thousand rubles without marketing frills.  This is not small, and in my opinion, I can even say a lot.  For the New 2015 Year, I bought a decent Yamaha subwoofer for this amount.  However, <i>this was before the new year ....</i> <br><br>  In conclusion about the good, the company Dadzhet provides for testing the device on the terms " <a href="http://geektimes.ru/exchange/order/44/">review for the device</a> ."  MOBISound, which I got, will soon be a gift for my dear girl.  It so happened that during testing I declassified it, but now I already know that she likes MOBISoud :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/365179/">https://habr.com/ru/post/365179/</a></p>
