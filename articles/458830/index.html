  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Dell Technologies Webinars: all the details about our tutorial</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello friends!  Today's post will not be long, but hopefully useful for many.  The fact is that for quite a long time already, Dell Tehnologies has been holding webinars on products and brand solutions.  We want to talk about them in brief today, and also ask the respected Habr audience to share their opinion on this matter.  Immediately an important remark: this story is about learning, not about selling. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/oy/3b/tf/oy3btf8xugdp95kvybvjgutqcvk.jpeg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  We have been conducting webinars for quite some time, but in the last couple of years the format has been settled and everything has taken shape into a full-fledged separate area of ‚Äã‚Äãactivity.  On the official Russian website of Dell Technologies, there is even a special section with webinars.  Now it is not as noticeable as we would like, but we are already working on it.  So that you do not have to spend precious time searching, immediately <a href="http://bit.ly/2KXyUtm">share the link</a> . <br><br>  By topic, all webinars are divided into 7 categories: storage systems, cloud solutions, data protection, convergent (and hyper-convergent) infrastructure, servers and networks, client equipment.  The seventh category is called "professional services."  If everything else is clear by name, here, perhaps, a little explanation is needed.  These webinars are not about technology, but about the services that Dell Technologies provides to its customers: warranty services, service support, deployment services, upgrades, and so on. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      Also, these 7 categories can be divided into two directions.  Six of these are fully within the purview of Dell EMC solutions.  And one of them called ‚Äúclient equipment‚Äù is more about webinars related to Dell hardware.  Here we are talking about desktop and mobile workstations Precision, business laptops Latitude, and, for example, secure devices Latitude Rugged to work in the most extreme conditions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/da/zu/iq/dazuiqnltlyz6zvhzhecmkz6c1o.jpeg"><br><br>  Most webinars last about an hour, and the estimated duration is always stated in advance, so that viewers can plan their time.  They are led by Dell Technologies staff members.  Sometimes, when it comes to launching products and solutions based on hardware of partners, representatives of partners can also act as speakers.  For example, relatively recently it was with Microsoft and VMware. <br><br>  Speakers are not marketers and sales managers, but direct product specialists or even system engineers who are deeply involved in the topic and can answer almost any questions from the audience.  Actually, it is for this that our webinars are worth watching live.  But if suddenly it did not work out, then it does not matter.  Ask questions will not work, but you can review everything in the record for almost unlimited time.  The oldest webinar currently posted on the Dell Technologies website dates back to December 15, 2017. <br><br>  By the way, in addition to very detailed presentations, speakers for their speeches are preparing additional materials: detailed specifications of newly-announced products, compatibility charts and other things useful in the work.  All this can also be downloaded both during and after the performance.  In this place, let us remind ourselves once again that webinars do not have a task to sell anything.  The main task is to tell how everything works, if possible, to explain why everything is done that way, to show key advantages and, in general, to give maximum useful information to those interested in our equipment and our solutions. <br><br>  Especially for you, we pulled one of the latest webinars out of the system.  This is so that you can watch the webinar right here, without going anywhere with Habr and not registering anywhere.  In it, Sergey Gusarov, a network solutions consultant, demonstrates the process of creating a network factory, automating the use of network settings for server connections, and basic operations for work. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/P5d7LKzcYHk" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Historically, we have used BrightTALK as a platform for webinars.  We are not planning on switching to anything else, because on the whole the system suits us, plus this is our global partner. <br><br>  Accessing webinars is extremely easy.  You simply go to the <a href="http://bit.ly/2KXyUtm">section with them on the official Dell Technologies website</a> , choose a webinar and go through a very fast registration.  Further, you can watch everything that interests you and pre-register for webinars that are planned for the future.  We tried to ask for the registration form to the maximum. <br><br>  Perhaps the only thing that can confuse a new webinar viewer is the need to indicate your mobile phone.  However, in no case will we ever call him with any suggestions.  Well, what is there to secretly, at the moment no one bothers the new user to just drive in random numbers.  By and large, you can do the same with other fields (except e-mail), but we, of course, ask not to do that, because understanding which people are watching the speeches of our speakers and what companies they work in is very useful for internal performance analysis and further planning of topics. <br><br>  As for the frequency of webinars, then we came to the format of "1-2 videos per month", although at first the speeches were more frequent.  Reducing the frequency allowed the speakers to get better prepared and to work on the topics deeper.  Well, regular viewers have little time for a month, let's say, to miss, and watch webinars with great interest. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/2m/bh/_o/2mbh_odjv05is4sql-ntmxesjg4.jpeg"><br><br>  It turns out that at this moment we told about the webinars themselves.  It remains perhaps to answer the main question: why did we bring them here, to Habr?  In fact, everything is simple.  The fact is that it seems to us that it is here that most of the IT specialists who can be interested in the topics covered in our webinars, not only for general educational purposes, but also for the practical application of the knowledge gained. <br><br>  In addition, if the company in which you work, already uses the technique of Dell and Dell EMC, then webinars are also an excellent channel for communication with our most experienced and specialized specialists.  It is rather difficult to ‚Äúget it‚Äù in social networks or through technical support, and not everyone is ready to go to conferences and forums specifically for this. <br><br>  And, of course, we wholeheartedly welcome absolutely any feedback.  In the polls below, you can tell us about your general interest in the topic and assess the quality of information, and in the comments you can safely write any detailed views regarding webinars: they are interesting, in your opinion, or not;  what to add and what to remove;  how to make them better;  which topics to pay more attention to, and so on. <br><br>  Thanks for attention!  We will be very glad to see you at <a href="http://bit.ly/2KXyUtm">Dell Technologies webinars</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/458830/">https://habr.com/ru/post/458830/</a></p>
