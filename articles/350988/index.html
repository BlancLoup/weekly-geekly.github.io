  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Recruitment: play, hitting the target</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vm/h0/6p/vmh06puhntdgqr6z6ibzk2p9cmo.png" align="right">  How often does it happen that you are wondering - how to understand whether a new candidate will cope with the work assigned to him?  Those who, by virtue of their profession, are engaged in the selection of personnel, face this issue every time and almost every time make mistakes in their initial conclusions.  It‚Äôs not for nothing that today the personnel question is considered one of the most difficult and selection is almost the first place in terms of complexity. </p><br><p>  When I communicated with employers, I understood how difficult it was for them to make a decision on how to select the best.  It's like predicting the future or doing work that carries a lot of pitfalls and obstacles.  They do not want to do this because they believe that the reception of workers is a lottery or an exam for which you are not prepared.  And this is understandable.  It seems you have experience and saw different people many times.  But one thing is to understand whether to deal with a particular partner, and another thing is to determine what the new employee will do and whether he has the necessary level of competence. </p><br><p>  There are a lot of questions.  And they seem intractable.  However, this is a fallacy! <a name="habracut"></a></p><br><p>  I realized that more often when interviewing a potential candidate during an interview, these people rely on his previous experience and on his impression of him.  Selecting staff believe that in order to choose the right candidate, you need to rely on your intuition, on your own view, which is made up of what you see and what the candidate says and how. </p><br><p>  In some ways they are right.  But if you take into account only your impression, no matter how wonderful a specialist you are, you will be mistaken only because it is subjective if you do not use any additional tools.  On the other hand, the people involved in the selection often do not have enough time to carefully and qualitatively evaluate the future employee.  And is it worth all those who wish to invite for an interview? </p><br><p>  You need some express methods that, even before you personally meet the candidate, will allow you to determine whether or not the applicant should be invited to a vacancy for an interview or testing. </p><br><p>  Putting myself in the place of managers, I wanted to create approaches to the selection of personnel that would be simple and easy and most importantly would give information on the basis of which there would be a clearer understanding of which employee you hire, with what potential his development zones and what kind of work he will do better. </p><br><p>  The process of selecting candidates begins from collecting information about them and analyzing the resume.  Anyone who looked through a resume, certainly noticed that, besides the facts of his biography, a potential employee tells us something else.  This is something elusive, but perhaps this is what provokes us to meet with the candidate or makes us reject and we confidently put off the resume, explaining our unwillingness to communicate with the author of the resume by saying that there is no necessary experience or education . </p><br><p>  However, it is precisely these positions that we are not aware of that provide us with the necessary information that will make the selection process more specific, and the result of the choice more effective.  Having understood this, I began to study the resume and compare the information in the document with the way the employee showed himself in the performance of the work assigned to him.  Thus, a system was created for selecting candidates for a vacant post on a resume.  As a result, a slender algorithm appeared, on the basis of which one can understand the following before the interview with the candidate: </p><br><ul><li>  How will a job applicant relate to routine work or work requiring creativity? </li><li>  Is the team player a new employee or individualist? </li><li>  Does he have order in his head or is he completely unassembled? </li><li>  Does he need control from outside, or can he be charged with any work he does, and at a high enough level? </li><li>  What is the level of claims of our newcomer and what is his motivation? </li><li>  Will he be committed to the goals and objectives of the organization, or will the newcomer spin intrigues and confront the rest of the workers with their foreheads? </li></ul><br><p>  On these issues, you already understand that the employee gives us much more information on the resume, which, unfortunately, we do not know how to read, relying on a probationary period during which, it seems to us, he will show himself.  Show or not - a big question. </p><br><p>  You can determine the necessary information before the interview by a small document that falls into your hands even before it appears on the threshold of your office. </p><br><p>  For example, analyze the resume of Steve Jobs, who recently <a href="https://www.rrauction.com/bidtracker_detail.cfm%3FIN%3D5002">put up for auction</a> . </p><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Steve Jobs Recap</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ar/xw/so/arxwso-yh-nq8dl2pvz_qh7ru2k.jpeg" alt="image"></p></div></div><br><p>  Let us analyze this summary not from the perspective of a specialist who made a breakthrough in the IT industry at one time, but from the perspective of the evaluation system about which I mentioned in this article. </p><br><p>  So, we can divide the summary analysis into three parts: </p><br><ol><li>  The form. </li><li>  Content. </li><li>  Font. </li></ol><br><p>  As you understand, the presented summary is impossible to analyze from the point of view of form and type.  And you, dear managers and personnel officers, lose a lot of information when you are looking at resumes from employment sites or when you make up a questionnaire for job seekers themselves.  But in terms of content, we can say that this candidate has a clear idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhat he wants, he was determined professionally, and will follow this direction.  He is a team player and knows how to relate his ideas to the direction in which a team is moving, he is able to bring something original and structured to work. </p><br><p>  Ask where this information comes from.  In the sections ‚ÄúSpecial skills‚Äù (Special Abilities) and ‚ÄúInterests‚Äù (Interests) Steve Jobs wrote: ‚Äútechnical engineer or digital designer‚Äù (tech or design engineer digital.).  This is quite specific indication of professional preferences and professional choice.  Yes, it does not correlate with his level of education for that period of time and it even becomes strange that, not having an adequate level of knowledge, this candidate claims to be a highly intellectual profession.  On the other hand, in these lines there is some concreteness and understanding of their choice.  Agree - this is already important. </p><br><p>  I looked through the packs of resumes and quite often meet with a misunderstanding of the candidates of what they wanted to earn for a living.  Jobs, perhaps, dreamed at that time to work in the field of high technologies: to design and create a design of new devices. </p><br><p>  In the column for specifying the skills, ‚Äúcomputer‚Äù and ‚Äúcalculator‚Äù are marked with a note ‚Äúdesign, technology‚Äù.  Moreover, the ‚Äúdesign, technology‚Äù arrows are directed to the corresponding definitions above to the computer and the calculator.  These arrows also give us an indication that a person has some algorithmicity in presenting his thoughts and the ability to build connections in the presentation of new information. </p><br><p>  I don‚Äôt know if employers would take note of this information and they would search for this candidate for this information, but I would have some appeal of this candidate, for example, as a potential employer.  Although, since the contact information in the submitted sample is not specified, it means that the applicant is not interested in receiving a vacancy. </p><br><p> Let's consider a <a href="https://novoresume.com/career-blog/elon-musk-one-page-resume">sample of the proposed resume</a> from one of the modern resume writing sites. </p><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Summary Ilona Mask</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wr/9n/aj/wr9najb2_pcfxb3qa9khke9gu0m.png" alt="image"></p></div></div><br><p>  <em>At once I will make a reservation, the choice of resume is random (it was necessary to have an interesting summary for the analysis of a famous IT person).</em>  <em>Of course, you can offer your resume for analysis.</em>  <em>But one thing should be taken into account - those qualities, the merits and demerits that will be described, can be very personal, can expose a person and, as a result, hurt him.</em>  <em>Thus, this is more information for reflection, for a more accurate approach when collecting data on the candidate and deciding on the next steps in the selection process.</em> </p><br><p>  This sample is not quite typical and such summaries are practically not found.  This is my opinion and someone can argue with him.  This summary was compiled by the authors of the site for Ilona Mask, as if it could be presented as an employee. </p><br><p>  <em>Before you read my analysis of this resume, try to add your own impression about this specialist.</em>  <em>After all, this person is now often spoken in the media.</em>  <em>The information goes contradictory.</em>  <em>And from my conclusion you are also unlikely to be able to create for yourself some kind of picture of a real person.</em>  <em>But we are playing ...</em> </p><br><p>  So, the compilers of the resume have shown us a real leader, breakthrough and ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù.  It selects organizations that are somehow connected with the government of the country in which it works.  He is ambitious and thinks that it is better to have a large state order for the fulfillment of the conceived task than to earn money in production.  Not a routine worker and loves large-scale tasks.  He does not like other people's rules and restrictions from the outside.  Not used and will not obey.  Rather, it is characteristic of him to subjugate those around him.  Independent in making decisions.  Able to achieve the goal.  Dislikes control from outside.  It is quite difficult to understand, not to strive to be clear.  He always has his plans, which he follows.  If these plans disagree with the goals of the organization, then he, rather, will create something of his own and push this idea so that in the end the whole team implements exactly what he had in mind. </p><br><p>  He will not answer the phone if he is not sure that he needs it.  But, regularly reviews emails.  Spends a lot of time at the computer.  He has complete order in his head.  Sometimes it does not take into account the opinion of the team in which it works, and even with the opinion of the powerful.  Often takes a risk.  But he has a good intuition, which helps him to maneuver the business of sharks and major politicians in the ocean.  He relies exclusively on his experience and is professionally defined.  He is really a good leader of a large successful company.  This man made himself. </p><br><p>  <em>Once again I will make a reservation that this resume was compiled on the site as a sample of a good or, as the compilers believe, a correct resume that would suit Ilona Mask.</em> </p><br><p>  Well, now a fly in the ointment.  In his work, he is meticulous and even boring.  Very critical and distrustful of subordinates.  In general, he is a "lone wolf" who quite often closes all functions on himself.  Exalted and does not disdain to use black PR for their own purposes.  About such as he can say that he literally "goes over the head," ignoring the rules and consequences.  Quite often, there is no justified risk.  Self-confident, good salesman.  Able to make the right connections and have the right people.  Dreamy.  Scattered in interests and predilections.  Independent of others' opinions, but very intolerant of external criticism.  It's hard to argue with him.  He rarely compromises.  In general, it is quite strange and unsociable. </p><br><p>  Whether resume compilers guess or not, but they have compiled a resume rather suitable to the head of a media company or the head of a company earning from promotion of other companies - in other words, a company engaged in advertising (in no way high-tech and especially the organization's leadership in space). </p><br><p>  All the information listed was obtained on the basis of the analysis of the information provided by the summary, according to the analysis system I wrote about at the beginning of this article. </p><br><p>  Do you want to know it or not - choose you.  And for those who are ready to study my approach in the evaluation of the summary I invite you to discuss.  Good luck! </p></div>
