These are the most unusual postal workers - in the long history of mankind the postman who has never been! <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/38e/9a6/aa6/38e9a6aa67d8412d9ee4c016b9e77bcf.jpg" alt="image" width="600"></div><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  <font color="#ff8300">Iceland national football team</font> </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a1d/4ab/d05/a1d4abd0525e45ceb31380172f000c5c.jpg"><br><br>  These guys have become a real sensation of Euro 2016 - defeated the British and reached the quarter-finals!  And the coolest thing is that among the players of the Icelandic national team there are practically no professional footballers, for which they got the nickname ‚Äúpostmen‚Äù.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/382/1e1/8e4/3821e18e443b47728a62df5c727900e9.jpg"><br><br>  At the post office in reality, another great player worked - Conor Washington.  After he was expelled from two sports academies, the guy got a job as a postman (he got up at half past five in the morning, delivered letters and parcels - everything was for real), and after work he drove to football for the local team.  It was there that scouts of the Newport club noticed him.  As a result, at the beginning of this year, Conor signed a contract worth ¬£ 3.6 million with Queens Park Rangers in London, and in the summer he played for the Northern Ireland national team! <br><br><h2>  <font color="#ff8300">Cat</font> </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2a9/bd1/cc4/2a9bd1cc476e4d219d883181dad5eab3.jpg"><br><br>  About a hundred years ago, the people of Belgium tried to make cats as postmen: 37 animals were taken from Li√®ge to different locations within a radius of 30 km, attached dispatches to them and simultaneously released.  The experiment failed miserably: the first cat came in 5 hours (average speed - 7 km / h!), And the last one came around a day later.  Oh yeah, almost all the postmen lost letters along the way ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a71/5df/a09/a715dfa099a0402686dc532152ce6b87.jpg"><br><br>  But the cat can be an excellent companion for a real courier!  This is exactly what Philadelphia resident Rudi Saldia thinks: a young man rides around the city on a bike, carrying letters, and his cat MJ Jay is traveling with him.  It looks pretty pretty funny, and the recipients love it! <br><br><h2>  <font color="#ff8300">Michael Dell</font> </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9a8/195/f51/9a8195f515a84e848826ee477e041bc2.jpg"><br><br>  The founder of the computer giant Dell in his youth worked on the mail, however, did not carry the mail, and vparival visitors a subscription to the newspaper.  The guy quickly realized that it was easiest to persuade new residents of the area.  He even paid his friends to bring new settlers to him!  Entrepreneurial talent, what to say! <br><br><h2>  <font color="#ff8300">Charles bukowski</font> </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f21/a31/b04/f21a31b042e64554aab12444882f5595.jpg"><br><br>  The recognized classic of American literature spent almost ten years at the post office.  In 1952, Bukowski got a job as a postman at the ‚ÄúAnnex‚Äù terminal in Los Angeles, and in 1971 wrote his first novel ‚ÄúPost Office‚Äù.  Interestingly, the book opens with the ‚ÄúCode of Conduct‚Äù of the US Postal Service of January 1, 1970, which describes the special role of a postal worker among other civil servants. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#ff8300">Dove</font> </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/218/22a/53c/21822a53c2784ee8bc18d7fcbc677c7f.jpg"><br><br>  Well, everything is clear here: even the ancient Romans appreciated that pigeons perfectly orientated themselves on the terrain and could make long flights.  In the twentieth century, pigeon mail was actively used on the fronts of the Second World War.  In England alone, 200,000 carrier pigeons ‚Äúserved‚Äù, which saved the lives of many people more than once.  For example, in 1942, Uinka's dove sent a message about a sinking submarine to the base (a bird flew 9000 km in 12 days!) And help came to submarines.  Uinki herself was awarded a medal for bravery. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#ff8300">Ostrich</font> </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8c6/5bf/a14/8c65bfa148254bf7a0ea61b45ddd7630.jpg"><br><br>  African pigeon version.  A new postman appeared among the inhabitants of Botswana villages Chachva and Kuchva.  In this wilderness there is no telephone connection and bus service, and there are twenty kilometers on foot.  Here are the locals and decided to hire an ostrich!  They hang a bag with letters around your neck - and in less than half an hour the courier appears at the destination!  They say that even mail transfers trust the ostrich! <br><br><h2>  <font color="#ff8300">Robots</font> </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ca7/046/027/ca70460277b541589a128780bb2006c5.jpg"><br><br>  Some Swiss postmen now look like small trucks with six wheels.  Courier robots are equipped with powerful computers that help them navigate the city (cars drive only along sidewalks and other pedestrian areas).  They say the experiment is designed for three years, and then the authorities will decide whether to take robots for permanent service. <br><br>  Bandera has its own <a href="https://qwintry.com/ru/Shipping%3Futm_source%3DGeekTimes%26utm_medium%3Dblog_post%26utm_campaign%3Dautumn16">Qwintry Air</a> delivery service.
