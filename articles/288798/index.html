  <section class="page js-page"><h1>On the Internet, people prefer large and high-quality articles.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/890/af5/8e3/890af58e3a4ec18a0996ff45fcd8bfda.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Perhaps you paid attention to the fact that many short notes are often published on the Internet, and long and comprehensive reviews on a given topic appear much less frequently.  And the point is not that the authors have no ideas for writing large comprehensive articles, and often lack of time to focus on all aspects of the topic.  In addition, many people on the Internet do not like to read long articles, since it is believed that the brain is easier to perceive only short passages. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In <a href="http://www.slate.com/">Slate</a> magazine, they decided to check these assumptions and <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2010/07/smart-editorial-smart-readers-and-smart-ad-solutions-slate-makes-a-case-for-long-form-on-the-web/">launched a project</a> in which they gave their journalists a sufficiently long period of time - from four to six weeks so that they could concentrate on creating one large article of the highest quality or creating a large review from short notes on one topic.  This allowed us to create the most interesting, impressive (and long) products of the work of journalists. <br><br>  And it would seem that very few people will read these long epics.  But in practice everything turned out differently.  Number of views overcame multimillion mark.  An average of 3-4 million reads of each of the works that participated in the experiment.  And this is despite the fact that the volume of these articles is tens of thousands of words.  This was confirmed by last year‚Äôs words of Jerry Martsorati, editor of the New York Times Magazine, that, contrary to the prevailing opinion, it was the longest and most voluminous articles that attracted maximum network traffic on their website. <br><br>  Journalists are increasingly worried that the web is filled with informational garbage.  The so-called ‚Äú <a href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20100708/01430610119.shtml">content farms</a> ‚Äù, which put the writing of articles on the Internet on a stream, emphasize the quantity and not the quality of publications, thereby killing journalism and forming a negative opinion about the profession.  Increasingly, network journalists are called "copy-paste". <br>  But "content farms" are not able to create the works described above.  They can not even come close to the volume and quality of such articles.  Writing quality articles requires higher professionalism of employees, and is much more expensive than the work of creating a quick flow of short messages.

      Perhaps the problem of traditional media is that they are engaged in writing a large number of short notes that can be easily copied by the staff of the ‚Äúcontent farms‚Äù.  Contrary to this, they should focus their efforts on deeper and better work.  To allow superficial coverage of events to those who can do it cheaply, and more serious organizations to focus on quality. <br><br>  <a href="http://techdirt.com/articles/20100715/01440910226.shtml">A source</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/288798/">https://habr.com/ru/post/288798/</a></p>
