This service was mentioned more than once <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/i_am_clever/8396/">in the pages of Habr</a> , but that bit of information that is devoted to Wakoope does not give a complete picture and all the usefulness of this unusual service. <br><img src="http://lakitu.wakoopa.com/1249461841/images/logo_homepage.png" alt="image"><br>  Immediately, I‚Äôll make a reservation that the paranoid should not read this post, as they will only get more upset and will impose their religion on others in the comments on this topic. <br><br>  According to the creators, Wakoopa is a social network that helps the user to find the best and most suitable software, sites, services and games.  But according to my observations, in addition to this, it is also a convenient and visual tool for tracking your activity at the computer. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  To start working with the service, you need to install a <a href="http://wakoopa.com/account/download">client</a> (tracker) that weighs 300kb.  After installation, Wakoopa Tracker hides in the tray and hangs there until you turn it off.  By default, the client is loaded with the OS, but this option can be canceled if desired.

      You will be able to see the first results of your activity on the day of registration: which programs you used, how many worked with them, and which programs worked in the background.  But you can get a more accurate picture of what is happening after a week has passed since the launch of the client.  The report will come to your inbox (but more recent data can always be viewed on your profile page by double clicking on the Wakoops icon in the tray). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/894/c4b/e5b/894c4be5bd2794558a57ca713dd36c3a.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The resulting report is quite detailed and contains various data, including: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ a dozen of the most popular software (weekly / monthly) <br>  ‚Ä¢ color chart with the directions of your activity for the last week (surfing the Internet \ program development \ work with audio and video \ games \ work with office) <br>  ‚Ä¢ recommendations on software and web services based on the programs you use and comparison of your activities with the activities of other users of the service (with similar interests and activities) <br>  ‚Ä¢ The latest actions of your friends on Wakoope and news of the groups to which you are subscribed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/026/066/8d1/0260668d1cd42dcc053ca7504302ac23.png" alt="image"><br><br>  What does this give us? <br>  Everyone has the right to dispose of information in his own way.  Personally, this information helps me to understand what the emphasis was placed over the last week and if I did not pay much time and attention to other things.  Of course, for people who cannot control themselves, Wakoopa will not help.  Here everything is designed for self-organization and personal discipline.  But take my word for it, looking at the weekly report, and finding Habr in the first or second place in it :)) or the fact that 60% of the time was spent surfing the internet, you realize that you are too ungrounded and you need to do more basic projects. <br><br>  In addition, Wakoopa has already managed to advise me a whole set of useful software.  For example, from her advice, I switched from paid Nero Burning Rom to a wonderful, equally convenient and absolutely free <a href="http://www.imgburn.com/">ImgBurn</a> , helped me find free software to create virtual drives on Windows 7 ( <a href="http://arainia.com/software/gizmo/overview.php%3FnID%3D4">Gizmo Drive</a> ) and recommended the <a href="http://www.filehippo.com/">FileHippo</a> software catalog, which keeps previous versions all popular programs and allows you to download their older versions, if necessary. <br><br><img src="http://img259.imageshack.us/img259/230/softrecomendation.png" alt="image"><br><br>  By the way, if you do not want the client to display any specific services or applications in your profile, you can exclude the interfering program from the list.  To do this, click on the name of the application in the list of the programs you use, and you will be taken to a page with information about the program.  After that, click on the <b>‚ÄúPrivacy‚Äù</b> button - you will have two options to choose from ... Show this to <b>‚ÄúNobody‚Äù</b> / <b>‚ÄúContacts‚Äù</b> .  The first option will hide the program from everyone, including you.  And the second option is to allow the selected application to be visible only to users listed as your friends on Wakoope. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/22f/c74/4e3/22fc744e3167431d8723eb60872ae526.png" alt="image"><br><br>  I don‚Äôt know how often you will use Wakoop for your own purposes, but I‚Äôm sure that the majority will find in it something interesting for themselves.  Someone will like the opportunity to monitor their activity and direct it in the right direction.  Someone will like Wacup's recommendations regarding new services and programs that you are not yet using.  And someone with interest will observe how the software is used by <a href="http://wakoopa.com/mio">other users of Habr</a> .  ;) <br><br>  In any case, try this service. <br>  Enjoy your dating!  )) <br><br>  A more vivid example is <a href="http://wakoopa.com/ArMikael">my</a> Wakoope <a href="http://wakoopa.com/ArMikael">profile</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/66565/">https://habr.com/ru/post/66565/</a></p>
