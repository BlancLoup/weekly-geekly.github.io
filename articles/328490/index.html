Send it to your hosting provider or system administrator to solve the problem. <br><br>  Do not forget to see our <a href="https://www.rackaid.com/blog/spam-blacklist-removal/">instructions for removing</a> other mail providers <a href="https://www.rackaid.com/blog/spam-blacklist-removal/">from the black lists</a> .  If Gmail blocks you, others can. <br><cut><br><h1>  Gmail Blacklist Criteria </h1><br>  Gmail does not disclose the details of its filtering process.  If they did, then spammers would quickly find a way around the filters. <br><br>  But we‚Äôve learned some typical reasons why Gmail can reject mail from your server. <br><br>  The most common causes are as follows: <br><br><ul><li>  Mailing a large number of letters. </li><li>  Sudden changes in the volume of letters sent. </li><li>  Sending a letter to the spam trap address. </li><li>  Sending letters to unknown users. </li><li>  Inclusion of server IP address in public blacklist </li><li>  Gmail users have tagged your email as spam. </li><li>  Use a new IP address when sending emails. </li><li>  Incorrect DNS settings. </li></ul><br>  If your server does any of the above, then you <i>seem to</i> send spam.  As a result, Gmail can block the IP addresses of your server. <br><br>  The ReturnPath survey, our own experience and the opinions of other letter delivery experts indicate that Google can use signals from these public blacklists: <br><br><ul><li>  pbl.spamhaus.org - the black list contains dynamic and non-server IP ranges.  Getting to the server is difficult. <br><br></li><li>  sbl.spamhaus.org - the blacklist contains emails that Spamhaus has marked as spam. <br><br></li><li>  xbl.spamhaus.org - the blacklist contains bots and exploit agents. <br><br></li><li>  cbl.abuseat.org - the black list contains emails sent to spam traps or that users have marked as spam. </li></ul><br>  You can use the <a href="http://www.anti-abuse.org/multi-rbl-check/">Multi-RBL search</a> to check these and other lists.  Inclusion in these lists is an obvious indicator that there is a problem with spam on your server. <br><br><h1>  Why have I been blacklisted by Gmail? </h1><br>  When I deal with a server that is on the Gmail blacklist, I usually find one of the following three reasons: <br><br><ul><li>  Spammers exploit the web application (&gt; 90%). </li><li>  Compromised password or client computer (~ 5%). </li><li>  Incorrect e-mail practices, such as blindly forwarding mail to Gmail (~ 5%). </li></ul><br>  <b>In more than 90% of cases, hackers use unprotected web applications to send spam.</b> <br><br>  In such cases, the volume of spam, user complaints, or other reasons lead to the triggering of Gmail blacklist filters.  They start blocking your server to protect their users from spam.  We have seen spammers <a href="https://www.rackaid.com/blog/spam-ssh-tunnel/">send spam through SSH tunnels</a> . <br><br>  Even in the absence of security problems, your server may still look like a spam system. <br><br>  If you redirect mail from your server to Gmail, and there is spam there, it looks like the server is sending spam.  As a result, Gmail may block your server. <br><br><blockquote>  <i>If you want to solve the problem and get out of the black list, then you need to delve into the server and understand what the problem is.</i>  <i>If you do not do this, all efforts will be futile.</i> </blockquote><br><h1>  Our Gmail blacklist investigation process </h1><br>  Here is the process that we use in our paid Gmail blacklist service: <br><br><ul><li>  Check server logs for 500 errors. </li><li>  Check the mail logs for blocking by other mail providers and public blacklists. </li><li>  Look for Excessive SMTP Authentications, especially from changing IP for the same user. </li><li> If you have PHP scripts, configure PHP to log <code>mail</code> calls using <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/mail.configuration.php">mail.log ini</a> . </li><li>  Check your IP with your favorite tools for checking IP in blacklists. </li><li>  Check your email server reputation at <a href="https://www.senderscore.org/">SenderScore.org</a> . </li><li>  Check that users don‚Äôt redirect bulk mail to Gmail and related domains. </li><li>  Check for any newsletters or mailing lists that are sent from the server. </li><li>  Make sure that the records related to DNS ( <a href="https://www.rackaid.com/blog/email-dns-records/">PTR</a> , <a href="https://www.rackaid.com/blog/email-dns-records/">DKIM</a> , <a href="https://www.rackaid.com/blog/email-dns-records/">SPF</a> ) are correct. </li><li>  Look at the old logs and compare whether the volume of letters has grown. </li></ul><br>  This process can take time, especially on a busy server.  I recommend to start with checking the compromise of users.  Although such cases are relatively rare, they are much easier to identify than problems with a web application. <br><br>  For example, on Plesk / Postfix configurations, you can put together shell commands in this way: <br><br><pre> <code class="bash hljs">grep sasl_username /var/<span class="hljs-built_in"><span class="hljs-built_in">log</span></span>/maillog|awk {<span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">'print $NF'</span></span>} |sort |uniq -c |sort -n</code> </pre> <br>  Such a string will immediately return the list of authenticated users by user name.  If you see a large number of authentications, then this user can be studied in more detail. <br><br>  Similar commands are suitable for extracting any useful statistics about the use of the mail server. <br><br>  Studying the history of the mail server, pay attention to the following: <br><br><ul><li>  New bugs 500 and 421 from other mail providers </li><li>  Entering IP into public blacklists </li><li>  Gmail Blacklist Response Code Changes </li><li>  Your SenderScore </li></ul><br>  Typically, such an investigation reveals a compromised web script or user password.  The situation can be corrected by changing or deleting the script or simply changing the user password. <br><br>  When you have fixed the root cause of the problem, start tracking mail volume from the server and response codes from Gmail.  If you are not removed from the black list, you can send a request to Google. <br><br>  In most situations we have encountered, such a request has never been sent.  Correcting the root cause and DNS problems usually results in exclusion from the blacklist within 3-5 days. <br><br><h1>  Gmail SMTP errors </h1><br>  Blacklists block your mail, and it does not go to the Spam folder (see our article on <a href="https://www.rackaid.com/blog/email-going-to-spam-folder/">why mail goes to the Spam folder</a> ). <br><br>  <b>If you are on the black list, your mail provider will give a bouncing SMTP with the code 421 or 550.</b> <br><br>  They can be found in the server log: <br><br>  <b>Error Example 550</b> <br> <code>Remote_host_said:_550-5.7.1 Our_system_has_detected_an_unusual_rate_of <br> unsolicited_mail_originating_from_your_IP_address. <br> _To_protect_our users_from_spam,_mail_sent_from_your_IP_address_has_been_blocked. <br> Please_visit_http://www.google.com/mail/help/bulk_mail.html <br> _to_review_our_Bulk_Email_Senders_Guidelines</code> <br> <br>  <b>Error Example 421</b> <br> <code>421-4.7.0 unsolicited mail originating from your IP address. <br> To protect ourn421-4.7.0users from spam, mail sent from your IP address has been temporarilyn4 <br> 21-4.7.0 rate limited.

If you have not done so, your efforts and time will be wasted. <br><br>  <b>If you have stopped the flow of spam from your server, Gmail will usually automatically unlock your IP within 3-5 days.</b> <br><br>  If not, you may need to contact them for help. <br><br>  In this case, use <a href="https://support.google.com/mail/contact/msgdelivery">this form to contact</a> .  Remember to log in to your Gmail / Google account before submitting the form. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/005/c7d/fae/005c7dfae71df9378977477560203a1d.png"><br><br><h3>  Instructions for completing the form to remove from the black list Gmail </h3><br>  I strongly recommend to fill all the fields, although they are not required.  It is in your interest to give the Gmail Blacklist removal team members as much information as possible and to show that you are not a spammer. <br><br><h4>  Short description </h4><br>  Be precise and concise.  For example, I usually use this text: <br><br><blockquote>  A web application that sent spam to Gmail was compromised on the server.  We removed this application from the server.  After removing the application, we no longer see unauthorized mail being sent to Gmail. </blockquote><br><h4>  Full headers </h4><br>  Make sure that the headings are given in full and in text format.  Only one example is needed.  In general, I am trying to find a simplified example.  Such a message, which is sent directly from your server to Gmail.  If the message has passed through third-party servers, the headers may be hidden. <br><br>  Use a text file (.txt) if possible.  Avoid specific Windows and Mac formats. <br><br><h4>  Server logs </h4><br>  Copy only the necessary part of the server log.  Just two or three entries will be enough.  They should look like the error examples 550 and 421 above. <br><br><h4>  MX search </h4><br>  Although this is an optional field, it is a key indicator that the DNS on your server is working.  A successful outcome will look like this: <br><br> <code>&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;br data-mce-bogus="1"&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt; <br> [jeffh@office ~]$ host -t mx gmail.com <br> gmail.com mail is handled by 40 alt4.gmail-smtp-in.l.google.com. <br> gmail.com mail is handled by 5 gmail-smtp-in.l.google.com. <br> gmail.com mail is handled by 10 alt1.gmail-smtp-in.l.google.com. <br> gmail.com mail is handled by 20 alt2.gmail-smtp-in.l.google.com. <br> gmail.com mail is handled by 30 alt3.gmail-smtp-in.l.google.com.</code> <br> <br><h4>  Telnet connection </h4><br>  Make a test from the problem server using one of the records obtained by searching the DNS above.  A successful outcome will look like this: <br><br> <code>&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;br data-mce-bogus="1"&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt; <br> [jeffh@office ~]$ telnet alt4.gmail-smtp-in.l.google.com 25 <br> Trying 2800:3f0:4003:c01::1a... <br> Connected to alt4.gmail-smtp-in.l.google.com. <br> Escape character is '^]'. <br> 220 mx.google.com ESMTP c68si3349613vkd.85 - gsmtp</code> <br> <br><h4>  Ping request </h4><br>  An example of a ping test.  Please note that if your firewalls block ICMP traffic, the test may fail.  Then just do not include the result in the application. <br><br> <code>&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;br data-mce-bogus="1"&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt; <br> [jeffh@office ~]$ ping -c5 alt4.gmail-smtp-in.l.google.com <br> PING alt4.gmail-smtp-in.l.google.com (64.233.190.26) 56(84) bytes of data. <br> 64 bytes from ce-in-f26.1e100.net (64.233.190.26): icmp_seq=1 ttl=43 time=169 ms <br> 64 bytes from ce-in-f26.1e100.net (64.233.190.26): icmp_seq=2 ttl=43 time=169 ms <br> 64 bytes from ce-in-f26.1e100.net (64.233.190.26): icmp_seq=3 ttl=43 time=169 ms <br> 64 bytes from ce-in-f26.1e100.net (64.233.190.26): icmp_seq=4 ttl=43 time=169 ms <br> 64 bytes from ce-in-f26.1e100.net (64.233.190.26): icmp_seq=5 ttl=43 time=169 ms <br> --- alt4.gmail-smtp-in.l.google.com ping statistics --- <br> 5 packets transmitted, 5 received, 0% packet loss, time 4175ms <br> rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 169.448/169.487/169.600/0.523 ms</code> <br> <br><h4>  Additional Information </h4><br>  This field is not limited in size, but be concise.  I usually list some unusual problems here or indicate that the client used to send a request for deletion from the black list, but didn‚Äôt clean the server before that. <br><br><h4>  Submit Form </h4><br>  After filling in all the fields you can send the form.  You should see the following: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c9c/da4/ac7/c9cda4ac73f270ee969e81ace4d9e3f4.png"><br><br>  Usually the update occurs within five business days. <br><br>  Keep in mind that in an easy way to solve everything will not work.  If you immediately hurry to the page of the form for removal from the black list, without cleaning the server, most likely you will be added to the list again. <br><br>  In July 2015, Google launched <a href="https://postmaster.google.com/">Gmail Postmaster Tools</a> .  They look like webmaster tools, but only for email.  If you manage e-mail for your domain or clients, you may want to register. <br><br><h1>  Getting help </h1><br>  Using this process, we solved all the * problems with the Gmail blacklist that we encountered. <br><br>  * In fact, there were several cases where the problem could not be solved.  Problem?  The client led a paid mailing list without confirming email addresses.  If you are acting as a spammer, then Gmail will consider you a spammer and blacklist you. </cut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/328490/">https://habr.com/ru/post/328490/</a></p>
