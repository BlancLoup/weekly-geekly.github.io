Let's think what prevents us from doing this? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I propose to consider two possible situations: <br><br>  <i>1. Driving on the motorway</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cc2/304/8be/cc23048be0c14bae8a6ebf8fa212bb5f.bmp" alt="image">

      <br>
      Accordingly, we consider several different options.  If we hit a traffic jam on a highway, we probably won't be able to drive around it, and the time we spend on our way will tend to infinity (in theory).  And the second option, driving on the highway without traffic jams will lead to the fact that the time we spend on our way will tend to zero. <br><br>  <i>2. Traffic in the city</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/190/9ad/024/1909ad0244db4df298fe03482006314a.bmp" alt="image"><br><br>  Let's model the following situation.  Consider again two options for the development of events.  What is the situation in the city? <br>  If we get stuck in a traffic jam in the city, we, as in the first variant (motorway), cannot drive around the traffic jam and get stuck in it for a long time.  And if there is no traffic jam, then it would seem that there is nothing stopping us, and we can quickly get from Section A to Section B in the shortest possible time.  But let's think what can prevent our comfortable overcoming this path? <br><br>  So, comrades, these are <b>traffic lights</b> !  They will interfere with our uniform movement, will affect our comfort, will increase the fuel consumption of our car due to the uneven movement of our car, many other problems, including reducing the service life of consumables.  And a thought arose in my head, and how can I protect myself and other road users from these listed problems? <br><br><h5>  The logic of my system </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/913/792/a1d/913792a1daa546a58660994fe1bc4436.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Consider drawing in more detail.  Initially, we have a text file (or another format - this is not important), in which we will store all the information for each specific traffic light, namely: <br><br>  <i>-time switching from red signal to green</i> <i><br></i>  <i>-time red signal</i> <i><br></i>  <i>-time green signal</i> <br><br>  Then this data from the file, we will cheat, analyze.  How?  Now we find out. <br><br>  Our traffic light ‚Ññ1 (in the picture it is to the left of the car) turned green at 22:00:00, burned green for 45 seconds, burned red for 15 seconds, from here we see that in the future, for example, as in the picture at 22:01:34, the traffic light will turn green.  Here you should pay attention to the following things.  The traffic light will also turn green and ten years later at this time (22:01:34), unless it is switched to <b>manual mode</b> , in which case all of our temporary standards will be reset.  Well, we have a file that contains all the information about every traffic light that meets our path.  It turns out that if we have the data, the route is pre-planned, it is necessary to arrive at the starting point, start the program for execution, and according to the data obtained at the exit, start moving. <br><br>  For writing software code used the language C #, the development environment of Microsoft Visual Studio.  Here is a screenshot of the program <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ef5/8eb/f62/ef58ebf6237c49e9ae9c9aaada7ece17.png" alt="image"><br><br>  We are at point A, pressing the F5 key starts the program.  The console displays messages for each traffic light, we start the car, we start to move, the system prompts at the moment which traffic light is on, we, in turn, decide whether we can move: increase speed or decrease.  I would like to remind you that this system works with free roads.  Thus, when we get to the first traffic light, it will be lit with a green signal, and so every traffic light.  As a result, according to the logic of the program, we will be able to overcome all the traffic lights on the green signal. <br><br><h5>  From theory to practice </h5><br>  The route on which I tested the system. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b01/19a/043/b0119a043d7646489341dae085c2bd2e.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The dots mark all 5 traffic lights (point A start, point G finish). <br><br>  As a result, all 5 traffic lights managed to get to the green signal, observing the rules of traffic rules, the system worked perfectly, there were no problems. <br><br><h5>  As I see further development of the system </h5><br>  In my opinion, each traffic light should be equipped with a sensor that will send the status of the traffic light to the server.  A mobile application will be launched on your mobile device, which by voice will prompt you to increase your speed, to drive to the traffic lights at the right time (green signal) or to reduce according to your coordinates and traffic lights on the way. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/933/3c8/a04/9333c8a046ca4ce9aebd96fd92828269.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  This system would find its application in taxi circles, which often work around the clock, and at night when crossing a city from one end to the other to the ‚Äúgreen‚Äù one, it would be the same, and other car owners moving along free roads. <br><br>  PS: My idea to any movements or government programs like the "green corridor" does not apply. <br><br>  How it all worked: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/qHLCH_7LhHQ%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,1500004,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgBl20J4XTj9qiuuscuYfZErWl2ew" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/393857/">https://habr.com/ru/post/393857/</a></p>
