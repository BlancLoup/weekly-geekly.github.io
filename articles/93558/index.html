  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Brainstorming - name for IP PBX</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  We went to the SvyazExpoCom'2010 exhibition. <br>  We decided to work along the way and come up with a name for the upcoming new products - small PBXs based on Asterisk.  Variants rained down from all sides, the conversation went something like this: <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><blockquote>  ... <br>  - Our PBX is small, powerful, users there are mobile and all that ... <br>  - Then "PBX Fairy" - small, mobile and powerful <br>  - Gygygygygygy <br>  - Well, in the same Asterisk ... So "IP PBX asterisk"! <br>  - Yes, and the form factor corresponds: round, small, and the inscription ‚ÄúMade not in Vietnam‚Äù ... <br>  - :-))) <br>  - Well, if she can do a lot, then let her be called "Hercules" ... <br>  - Yes, GeraKAKL ... <br>  - Gerych ... ;-) <br>  - ABOUT!  Let's turn to Greek folklore.  ATS "Zeus" - cool? <br>  - What about the Greek?  Let's go to ours!  ATS "Baba Yaga" :-) <br>  - ATS "Gorynych"! <br>  - Noah, Gorynychu constantly boks cut, and does not roll ... <br>  - ATS "Koschey"! <br>  - No, Koschey still dies as a result ... <br>  - And what is normal, in order to fill up the PBX, you need to open the lid, get the microcircuit, break the microcircuit, get the crystal, break it in half ... :-) <br>  ... <br></blockquote><br>  That's about such a move reached the fairy tale "Three Little Pigs."  If anyone does not remember, the plot is as follows: pigs build houses from straw, from branches, and from stone.  The wolf brings down the first two, and breaks off on the third.  And now let's transfer it to 3 PBX models. <br>  <b>ATS NafNaf</b> <br>  Benefits and features: <br><ul><li>  low price, no pity to throw out </li><li>  features: can call </li><li>  there is no support </li><li>  reliability: - </li><li>  original chipset from leading Vietnamese manufacturer HuniNyau </li><li>  produced under license from the Chinese company VamHana </li></ul><br>  <b>ATS NufNuf</b> <br>  Benefits and features: <br><ul><li>  price: more expensive by 30% compared with NafNaf </li><li>  functional: the same </li><li>  Those support: from 1 night to 5 am on weekends and holidays </li><li>  packaged solution (delivered in box) </li><li>  reliability: tested twice in our laboratory </li></ul><br>  Well, the main model - <b>IP PBX NifNif</b> <ul><li>  the third generation of PBX systems, which includes all the best features of the first two </li><li>  armored shock resistant copru </li><li>  waterproof housing (the ability to work at a depth of 50 meters) </li><li>  Support phone (engraved on the case) - 8 (495) 23 23 956 extension 8 </li><li>  perfectly proved in tests in our laboratory </li><li>  annual guarantee - 100 thousand rubles, after the expiration of the warranty period it is possible to return with payment of 50% of the cost. </li><li>  Package Includes: <br><ul><li>  cot </li><li>  a bottle of vodka </li></ul><br></li><li>  Integrators are invited to: <br><ul><li>  life insurance </li><li>  first aid kit </li></ul><br></li></ul><br>  Well, of course, Success Story.  Hemor Telecom Company, IT Director: Marcel Dyatlov <br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúFirst of all, I would like to thank the manufacturers of this unique equipment.  Thanks to them we have known the taste of life. <br>  We take IT projects seriously, so we‚Äôve taken seriously the choice of PBX. <br>  After a year of thorough market analysis, we decided to opt for the product NafNaf. <br>  This is simply the perfect solution for companies with a surplus of system administrators. <br>  We fully met the planned implementation timeline - one year. <br>  I would like to mention the work of those support with whom we are already friends with families. <br>  Milestones in the project: <br>  01/01/2008 - the final decision was made on the purchase of ATS NafNaf as the most optimal solution for the price factor. <br>  01/02/2008 - ATS NafNaf delivered to office and unpacked <br>  01/04/2008 - The vodka supplied in the kit is over.  They sent an application form in those support with a request to send another box. <br>  01/05/2008 - ATS NafNaf burned down, and with it our office. <br>  03/10/2008 - We moved to a new office.  The server room has a kitchen, toilet, sofa, shower. <br>  March 11, 2008 - We contacted ‚ÄúThree Little Pigs‚Äù Ltd. and requested a commercial offer for the installation of telephones in the new office. <br>  03/12/2008 - They signed a contract for the supply of the next generation automatic telephone exchange of NufNuf, paid on the same day. <br>  07/10/2008 - ATS NufNuf and a box of vodka were delivered to the office, the staff went to work. <br>  08/16/2009 - We were able to connect the first subscriber, the staff went to work. <br>  08/17/2009 - ATS NufNuf could not stand the load and failed, the office was put out. <br>  08/18/2009 - After the meeting with the IT department, they decided to order a turnkey solution based on the 3rd PBX NifNif. <br>  09/11/2008 - ATS NifNif has been delivered to the office by Customer‚Äôs specialists.  I had to urgently cut through a wider entrance to the server in order to bring the PBX.  Immediately obvious, a serious system. <br>  10/12/2008 - A PBX has been launched.  Employees went to work. <br>  10/13/2008 - unable to withstand the load, the block of analog ports fell off.  Junior admin Terpyak proposed to support the unit in turn. <br>  10/15/2008 - the power supply has fallen off, now two administrators support the PBX. <br>  10/17/2008 - the contact of the CPU loop has been broken.  Now PBX support already 3 admin. <br>  Thus, we have involved the entire staff of our numerous IT department.  Previously, they only knew that they smoked and drank coffee.  And now everything is in business, working ... For as many as 3 months the station works like a clock, not a single failure.  Unless periodically it beats with a current, from what falls the one who holds, and what keeps, well, nothing, immediately rises, the idle time per week is no more than 10 minutes. <br>  We are glad that we have solved all our problems. <br>  Yes, it is ...
