Further in the review you will be able to see a few more multicolored camera options, but all of them are prototypical and are designed only to evaluate the reaction of consumers.

      <br>
      In the meantime, I present to your attention two main colors available.  Let's take a closer look at them. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/54c/731/0ab/54c7310ab1afc26d04082093adec899c.jpeg"><br><br>  This photo gives a good idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe appearance of the GALAXY Camera in two colors.  As for the style, the white version looks brighter, while the black one is designed in the traditional style.  Your choice, of course, depends only on you, but personally I prefer retro style, and black color suits me better. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/0e0/2ac/f64/0e02acf6409c3bafcc0f717d77287733.jpeg"><br><br>  If you look at the black color of the camera, you will see that it is actually dark blue rather than black.  However, I still prefer this option. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/061/f71/6fb/061f716fb39eb09c8915b501feb72e31.jpeg"><br><br>  On the display side, the white and black GALAXY Camera are almost indistinguishable from each other. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/dd3/57b/603/dd357b6035f47d85997c55c0c1e43df3.jpeg"><br><br>  Let's look at the camera from all sides.  The upper side is minimal for ease and ease of use.  Minimum details can be traced in the design of the device as a whole. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1af/3ed/4d3/1af3ed4d357bc2db7bc0783b9a00caa5.jpeg"><br><br>  Now that we have studied the camera from all sides, let's put two cameras side by side. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b3f/639/fb4/b3f639fb4450ac54bbf6d5770b31380b.jpeg"><br><br>  So which one looks better in your opinion? <br><br><h2>  <font color="ff0000">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">Dimensions GALAXY Camera</font> </h2><br>  To the envy of my fellow bloggers, I, it seems, was the only one in the whole exhibition who took the measuring equipment with me.  I hope this will give you a more complete picture of the dimensions of the novelty. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6b5/56c/295/6b556c2958be45348ee1194c440eaba7.jpeg"><br><br>  The device is quite heavy (310 grams), most of the weight falls on the optical system of the lens.  Well what can I say: a good camera needs good lenses. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ece/2eb/811/ece2eb8118b4263d194937edf8cf9986.jpeg"><br><br>  Official specifications speak of a thickness of 19.1 mm.  It looks like it is. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e35/8d6/6a4/e358d66a4eddb130b2a508efb5a358c2.jpeg"><br><br>  In the widest part of the body, the thickness is 27 mm. <br><br><h2>  <font color="00a8ff">‚ñå Camera</font> <font color="000000">accessories</font> </h2><br>  Despite the short development time, the GALAXY Camera will be accompanied by a rather large collection of accessories.  The camera needs a good case, and users definitely have plenty to choose from. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9d8/246/1cb/9d82461cb2715382911346bb6bf78a27.jpeg"><br><br>  As for carrying cases, there are two varieties in different colors.  Besides them there are many more options. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b72/0e1/59c/b720e159c3194388d6b6eed56cd123f1.jpeg"><br><br>  In addition, there were bags with a folding case and cases "wallets", as well as covers for quick shooting, belts, filters, bags on the belt and over the shoulder, and many other details. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/275/f3c/c71/275f3cc718425f6fd1970fe64fc85be9.jpeg"><br><br>  Obviously, Samsung has high hopes for the GALAXY Camera.  If you don't believe me, just keep reading!  You have not seen much else. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9e9/f3f/5a6/9e9f3f5a6ecac069859f7b370b498a59.jpeg"><br><br>  The fact that the GALAXY Camera is currently only available in two colors does not matter, as many different colored cases are presented to the user's choice. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1e2/7ca/e92/1e27cae92d0265408666f129e47449bc.jpeg"><br><br>  What else do you want?  Strobe lights, viewfinders, external flashes, filter adapters, and much more are also available. <br><br>  Here are some of the camera kits you could already see on <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/08/31/samsung-galaxy-camera-flashes-housing-hands-on/">Engadget</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/8ea/0ae/b0e/8ea0aeb0ee4a8ff6e40d857781e410dc.jpeg"><br><br>  With the exception of a tripod, these cameras look more like prototypes.  But, as mentioned earlier, Samsung has high hopes for this product, which may affect the availability of these clever kits in consequence. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d90/113/df5/d90113df5506e53065e62ac3bc264c9d.jpeg"><br><br><h2>  <font color="ff9c00">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">Other colors for GALAXY Camera</font> </h2><br>  Unfortunately, despite the large variety of cameras of different colors that were presented at the exhibition, the possibility of acquiring them after the start of sales is still under question.  As I mentioned above, this will depend on the reaction of the audience, so at this point you will have to limit yourself to the presence of multi-colored cases for new items.  Although, judging by the interest of the guests of the exhibition, the orange color of the camera was the most popular of all. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2ba/9bc/c0e/2ba9bcc0e6c7009e623c6b55f192ed19.jpeg"><br><br><h2>  <font color="0c00ff">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">Video review GALAXY Camera</font> </h2><br>  You're probably curious about how the camera works in real conditions and how fast it takes pictures, so I filmed this process on video. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/aw-dgbGCUh0%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhiKu0FeHjKpO_ulhmpK6p97IVpVPA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  The video demonstrates an autofocus performance test (AF).  As you can see, the autofocus speed is faster than you would guess.  According to Samsung, this is only a prototype, and the actual speed of work will be faster at the time of the start of sales. <br><br>  I also got the opportunity to do a test of the approximation function.  In the process of approaching its level is displayed on the screen.  You can also see that autofocus works great even at maximum zoom. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/BfvQnUz7BXk%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhjIG5jVYis7FQ8oB0Eptp_aE-lnCw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h2>  <font color="00ff33">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">Opinion blogger about GALAXY Camera</font> </h2><br>  Before judging the camera, you should have a clear understanding of its concept.  The image quality is not as good as in mirrorless cameras, and the size and functionality of the device is not quite suitable for use as a smartphone. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/057/a9b/d62/057a9bd6218d27172094950a098b7579.jpeg"><br><br>  But this is not the main thing.  Currently, most people who take pictures want to share their pictures in social media, and not just store photos on computers.  Smartphones began to acquire good cameras, because of this, many have ceased to use separate cameras.  But, in my experience, for really good pictures, you still need a full-fledged camera.  On the other hand, modern devices lack the convenient and fast functions for transferring files, uploading photos to social networks.  networks, photobanks or cloud services.  GALAXY Camera allows you to do both without the hassle. <br><br>  I spend a lot of time visiting and reviewing restaurants and other public places in various social services.  network services: believe it or not, the popularity of my reviews is quite high.  To be sure that I publish my reviews and reviews among the first, it is extremely important for me to be able to quickly upload the best photos.  This creates the need for better quality photos and high download speeds.  Probably many bloggers need the same thing. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/695/eff/6e4/695eff6e48946cb379e2179856d04b5f.jpeg"><br><br>  GALAXY Camera is made for people like me.  The device automatically uploads high-quality photos to cloud services faster than others. <br><br>  One of the drawbacks of this camera is that it cannot replace a telephone.  Telecommunications companies want to sell similar devices with limited functionality.  But time will tell that it is meaningless. <br><br>  In addition, the image quality does not compare with the quality that mirrorless cameras give out, like the NX1000, which also has a Wi-Fi connection (although not so convenient to use). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4cb/e7c/bfe/4cbe7cbfe6b8ac5a1bf2fb271b46a2a5.jpeg"><br><br>  Samsung representatives never said that they would not make mirrorless cameras with Android (such a device would make me happy).  This is the final part of my review.  Conclusion about GALAXY Camera do you.  My recommendations?  If you get a chance to try out this new product, do not miss it! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/158649/">https://habr.com/ru/post/158649/</a></p>
