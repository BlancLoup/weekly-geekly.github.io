This time I decided to try ‚ÄúFreelance‚Äù, as a new and developing resource.  The result was a mini-review of the resource with my eyes, which may be interesting to someone (many pictures) <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The first thing that catches your eye is a hat, where instead of advertising, there was a message about single accounts for a long time and an offer to hammer on all your freelancing and go into voluntary office slavery: <br><img src="http://rghost.net/41709952/image.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Well, about advertising offices will not write, it is clearly evident that people were wrong with the target audience, but with accounts it is not clear.  What are these accounts?  Why do they need me?  Who do I join with?  I just came to you, I do not have any accounts!  Well, what I find fault, just painted brightly and out of place.  Let's look at the most important thing - the work itself.  I don‚Äôt look at the icons, but work to work: <br> <a href=""><img src="http://rghost.net/41709968/thumb.png"></a>

      What I see?  Three minutes ago a new project appeared!  Great!  So the resource is full of life and there is a lot of work on it that is enough for everyone!  True, I am not an SEO, I do not deal with doorways, and I cannot take the implementation of this project.  I am watching the next one - 2 days (TWO) days ago!  STO?  For two days a single project?  Convulsively watching the next project - he left 4 days ago!  FOUR DAYS!  Those.  in 4 days there were as many as 3 projects?  The first thought is to close the tab and not to return to this dead resource this year, and perhaps in a year to see how and what it is.  Well, why do I need a resource, where about 20 projects are posted a month? <br><br>  However, having defeated my laziness, I scroll the page and look further - no, the resource is actually alive, just the authors made attached ads, without highlighting them.  Apparently on the basis of the fact that I will constantly see them, read the blunt text and will make projects only for the sake of not seeing them anymore.  I must say that some of the attached projects are still highlighted in color.  This is good, you can skip them without reading: <br><img src="http://rghost.net/41709987/image.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Price.  Only one project has a price on the page.  But there are wonderful web3.0 buttons with tags ‚Äúresponsibility‚Äù, ‚Äúwork speed‚Äù, ‚Äúconstantly online‚Äù and other brain diseases of HR-managers.  Apparently done for people who can not do anything except how to be "constantly online."  Dear managers, why do you post it?  No, I understand perfectly well that there are different situations, perhaps permanent online is critical in some project - write it in the text, why do you need to make a tag out of it?  Reminded already forgotten: <br><img src="http://rghost.net/41710007/image.png" alt="image"><br><br>  I tried to poke on these tags - nothing useful happened.  Why choose a job ‚Äúonly for the responsible ones‚Äù I don‚Äôt really understand (actually the function would be useful if it didn‚Äôt allow to see sentences with such tags - as a rule, the requirements ‚Äúexecutive‚Äù, ‚Äúresponsible‚Äù and others in this spirit come from people with which it is extremely unpleasant to work).  In general, the buttons are trite copied from the odes, where in the tags at least something useful is sometimes indicated, but we just post the managerial gag.  Managers, remember: if I had been responsible, with fast work speed, work experience of 10 years and with the help of a visiting priest, then I would not have reached your announcement. <br><br>  We look further.  Categories: <br><img src="http://rghost.net/41710027/image.png" alt="image"><br><br>  A person needs a solution from the web world, but what does he have in categories?  In categories, some plug-ins, it is not clear what.  Being a flash application developer, I would never think of seeing the category about plugins.  But I would look through the category "design", nothing makes sense in the latter, since many orders for flush settle there.  Although stop, ‚Äúdesign‚Äù is in itself a bundle of categories, i.e.  In the evening there is an occupation for the evening.  In the end, I would have spat and looked at the tape as a whole, even if I didn‚Äôt run into doubles.  It turns out another feature that just "should be." <br><br>  We look further.  Hm  Seem something is missing?  But what?  Oh yeah, responded freelancers.  For example, if 50 people have already responded to the project, then my chances for it are almost nil.  Sometimes you open a project and read ‚ÄúI will do it for 100 rubles‚Äù, ‚Äúand I will do it finally for review !!!! 1‚Äù, ‚ÄúChoose me, I'll pay more‚Äù.  I would not post my offer in such a highly competitive environment, it‚Äôs just a waste of time.  But I can learn about high competition only by going to the project: <br><img src="http://rghost.net/41710522/image.png" alt="image"><br><br>  So I have to look through every project that I can potentially complete?  And when to rest?  With this approach, from morning to night I will look for projects, it‚Äôs better to go into office slavery, honestly. <br><br><h4>  Well, everyone can plug in, but have you achieved anything at least? </h4>  Indeed, everyone can poke, but to offer something of their own is not.  And I will offer: <br> <a href="http://dump.bitcheese.net/files/okotipy/freelance.html"><img src="http://rghost.net/41710046/image.png" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  Key features: <ul><li>  Zero design.  This means that there are NO social network icons, there are no translucent layers and in general all that is NOT necessary at the time of the project search.  Sometimes they make such a design that the page weighs half a meter, the browser barely chews it, slowing down when scrolling, and there are only 10 projects on the page. </li><li>  All projects on one page.  Please note that the page weighs about 300kb - this is much less than some templates from some popular sites, and the benefits are huge.  Once the pages were divided into 10 records, so that people on the modems could read everything, but now the size of the pages already many times exceeds the volume of the marked text. </li><li>  Ability to search directly on the page.  My browser is able to search for texts, for this you do not need to constantly go to the search on the site, and the search in the browser will always be faster. </li><li>  Immediately visible budget and the number of respondents, right in the title.  I can follow the link, I can immediately ignore </li><li>  All projects with the words ‚Äúdesign‚Äù, ‚Äúseo‚Äù, ‚Äúvkontakte‚Äù, ‚Äúresponsible‚Äù, ‚Äúsuper‚Äù and the like were removed from the page.  Some of them are because I am not a designer, the other part is for the reason that I am not ‚Äúsuper responsible with a certificate from an Orthodox priest‚Äù and I prefer not to work with such people.  The bottom line is only those projects that could potentially interest me (I have many rules for cutting projects, 95% of projects are eliminated when generating such pages) </li></ul><br><br>  While I did not register, work on my profile is not enough (or did I not find it?), But I am pleased with the development of the resource.  Let's see what will happen in the future. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/159613/">https://habr.com/ru/post/159613/</a></p>
