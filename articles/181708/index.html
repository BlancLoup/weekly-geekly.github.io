The cooling system was passive - i.e.  the oil was not forced cooling, but only dissipated heat through the walls of the aquarium.  This led to the fact that for 3 hours of operation (load 100%, frequency 850 MHz - full-time) the video processor warmed up from 55 to 80 degrees (when overclocking the frequency to 1000 MHz, the heating time to 80 degrees was tripled).  The oil in the aquarium, at the same time, is heated from room temperature to 58 degrees.  I took the load off and left the computer on - in 2 hours the oil temperature dropped to 50 degrees and locked in.  Thus, I determined the threshold of the effectiveness of the cooling system in idle mode - and it did not suit me.  50 degrees for some components is not the most comfortable temperature. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  To refine the cooling system, I needed a radiator with good heat transfer and a pump for pumping oil.  By the time I started work, I had not yet decided whether I would need a fan to cool the radiator. <br>  The automobile radiator of the interior heater came up just right - compact and efficient.  It cost me 650 rubles.  Pump selected Hydor SELTZ L30 1200 l / h - the cost of 1700 rubles. <br><br>  I did the first experiment at random - I was ready for the fact that the system may not work in sunflower oil, or the components will be spoiled in the process of unknown reactions to me.  But now, three weeks later, the computer, immersed in the cheapest sunflower oil, despite the threats of skeptics, continues to work.  Oil has not changed neither color, nor consistency, nor transparency.  Fur animal did not go to the capacitors, and the processor socket is also not visited.  I hope that if this did not happen immediately, then it will not happen later - time will tell, but, in any case, I already feel much more confident.  Therefore, I installed another video card and connected a temperature sensor. <br>  I had to drain the oil - for this I used a pump. <br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/v8_xDvMmkcI%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700043,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhiEP2HD4vbUW64gq9s8mzRAwRY6CQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  After I removed the components from the oil, I examined the system for damage.  The first thing that caught my eye was the broken latches for the CPU cooler.  The processor heatsink fell off as soon as I took it out, and I did not install it back (as it will turn out for nothing).  The remaining plastic parts were not affected.  The motherboard looked like new - no clots of dried oil. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c12/584/7d4/c125847d45ab3c5ad432cd89766833bd.jpg">

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/fe8/8d6/24e/fe88d624efffd55cdaca2aeba8047c3c.jpg"><br><br>  After the pump and radiator were connected, I installed all the components back into the aquarium and filled it with oil. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/039/698/623/039698623b4c8c3455e9e8e30d04ba70.jpg"><br><br>  To test the thermal mode, I chose the same test as the first time - mining.  Only this time on two video cards.  He turned on the pump immediately, but has not yet put the fan on the radiator.  Almost immediately drew attention to the temperature of the CPU - it rose to 60 degrees.  When the radiator was installed, the temperature of the processor never exceeded the temperature of the oil - all the same, the radiator helped to dissipate heat more efficiently even in oil. <br>  The test result was the same as for the first time - three hours of load and the critical temperature of graphics processors and oil was reached.  Only this time 2 video cards were installed. <br>  Fixing the temperature of the oil at 50 degrees under load helped only 120mm fan, which had to be installed to blow the radiator.  Thus, the system did not work silently.  You can't hear the pumps during the day - the light vibration is almost completely extinguished by oil, but the fan is slightly audible, with the windows closed and the equipment off. <br><br>  Well, that's all, thank you for your attention.  The system is still working, if something breaks - I will definitely accomplish my goal (I hope not) <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/2e1SEMd1kh4%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700043,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjiD7yhrUdzVjXL0N41qsNPO8fdAQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/181708/">https://habr.com/ru/post/181708/</a></p>
