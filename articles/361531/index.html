Fine.  7 grams.  So the napkin weighs less than a gram, and much more than 140 characters will fit into it. <br><br>  <i>a mounth later</i> <br>  Dreamer: Answer me one question, how much does it cost to put a kilogram into orbit?  My rough estimate from above is one million rubles. <br>  Engineer: "Dnipro" can be for 300 thousand, but what? <br>  Dreamer: Yes, yes, then I will tell. <br><br clear="right"><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <i>a mounth later</i> <br>  Dreamer: I want to launch a satellite. <br>  Entrepreneur: What? <br>  Dreamer: I want to launch a satellite.  Throw a project on Kickstarter.  To offer bakers as a reward to write a short note.  And according to the Kubsat technology, launch a kilo box with notes into orbit.  1 note = 1000 rubles. <br>  Entrepreneur: Understand, I now need the money.  Need a quick project.  With quick exhaust.  We are opening a hostel.  Will you participate? <br>  Dreamer: And what will I have from this? <br>  Entrepreneur: It is difficult for me to evaluate your contribution right now.  Come on, you are now helping me completely with my project, and then I help you completely with your project. <br>  Dreamer: Agreed. <br><br>  <i>hostel opening party, december</i> <br>  Dreamer: An entrepreneur is an engineer, an engineer is an entrepreneur. <br>  Entrepreneur: Pleased to meet you <br>  Engineer: Mutually <br>  Dreamer: Then the idea arose to build a Martian station according to the drawings of Robert Zubrin. <br>  Engineer: We must build on reality, no one needs it.  Like your companion.  I now want to read about the history of astronautics in your hostel lecture, can I? <br>  Dreamer: Of course, we are for dvizhuhu.  I can also arrange for you to perform in the "Alarm Clocks" in Moscow and St. Petersburg. <br>  Engineer: Great.  I want to devote myself to astronautics, I want millions to come to my lectures (smiles). <br><br>  <i>a week later</i> <br>  Dreamer: There is such a situation, we did not get along with the owner, so your lecture is being transferred from the hostel to the temporary office. <br>  Engineer: OK. <br>  Dreamer: Everything will be ready, a projector, chairs, a screen, we will organize everything.  Tell me, but at SP-1, the antennas are visible on the picture and it is flying straight ahead, what was its stabilization system? <br>  Engineer: Yes, nothing stood there, it rotated chaotically. <br>  Dreamer: So it turns out, if you screw the mirror to the satellite, then due to the random rotation it will be reflected by the reflected rays to the Earth? <br>  Engineer: You can do it easier, to inflate a shiny cylinder with gas, as stratospats inflate. <br>  Dreamer: Cool! <br><br>  Dreamer: How much does a gold foil for spacecraft cost?  I thought here that as a reward, bakers could be given a small piece of ‚Äúfoil‚Äù as a souvenir. <br>  Engineer: Oh, dear, although I will call the factory, I will clarify. <br><br>  <i>Two days later</i> <br>  Engineer: At the plant they said that if for educational purposes, they can give it for free and asked how many square meters it is necessary? <br>  Dreamer: Great.  You understand that if you dial a group of intelligent students / schoolchildren and do a project with them, then this, like a code for passing through walls, will open any door to all institutions.  Just think what the title might be: ‚ÄúRussian schoolchildren launched a satellite‚Äù. <br><br>  Very harsh engineer 2: So why do you want to launch a satellite?  What is the use of it? <br>  Dreamer: ‚ÄúThe Good‚Äù will be to show everyone that this is possible.  That a simple person, with the support of people, crowdsourced, launched a satellite, without asking the government for money, without languishing in the dungeons of defense enterprises for years ... At first, I thought about putting a pick on the satellite, and then changing my mind.  It is much more important to lay a path to space.  Narrow and unprepossessing, almost useless.  But on the other hand, find out in full what is needed ‚Äúfrom and to‚Äù to launch a satellite, so that every reader will believe that he himself can do it, that this is not the prerogative of the military, the rich, the elite or space engineers.  That Cosmos is near.  With the thought of anyone who wants to, for a thousand rubles you can send to the sky <br>  Very harsh engineer 2: No one will even talk to you.  Waste of money and time. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e47/91f/34a/e4791f34af724cb4b411bf93be01c89b.jpg" align="right">  <i>basement january 2014</i> <br>  Entrepreneur: We have to make a move for a hundred thousand people, let everyone throw off the money and then we will launch this satellite.  For now let's gather all interested in cooperation engineers interested in space. <br>  Dreamer: I don‚Äôt want to earn money on this, I just want to do a) what I‚Äôm interested in b) that ‚Äúopens the door to space‚Äù to anyone who wishes, regardless of his money, status, and so on.  I want to do this not for, and not at the expense of people, but with them. <br>  Entrepreneur: I found a picture for you.  Understand, the only way possible with people.  If you drag in front of you, you will die first.  Need to be taller and smarter.  Let you carry. Find students, they will do all the work for <s>free</s> idea.  Due to all this movement, we will get our benefit, much more than it seems at first glance to an ordinary person.  And when Rogozin asks who is in charge there, it will be me. <br>  Dreamer: Here we fundamentally disagree. <br><br>  <i>hostel</i> <br>  Engineer: I think that you need to look for a sponsor, ordinary people do not need anything, they will not give a penny. <br>  Entrepreneur: I bet!  We are arguing for a new one, that I will collect money right now from the hostel visitors, telling them about a beautiful idea? <br>  Engineer: I bet. <br>  Entrepreneur: Ladies and gentlemen, I‚Äôll ask you for a minute of attention [...] If you are interested, you can give at least 100 rubles even now. <br>  Girl: Here, keep 100 rubles. <br>  Entrepreneur: [ <i>succulent click</i> ] <br><br>  <i>basement march 2014</i> <br>  Entrepreneur: I sell a hostel.  I get my money, and let others deal with local problems.  Dreamer, thank you for participating.  <i>A satellite, I still launch</i> . <br>  Dreamer: What about ‚ÄúI will help you <i>in your</i> project‚Äù? <br>  Entrepreneur: (shrugs) <br><br>  <i>cafe, march</i> <br>  Engineer: Dreamer, too few people came to the last lecture, you poorly fulfill your obligations. <br>  Dreamer: Did you not fuck up?  Actually, I help you voluntarily and without commitment, and instead of hearing thanks from you, you are still throwing at me. <br>  Engineer: You need to be disciplined, I do not like this situation. <br>  Dreamer: Ok, now you can take the lectures in your own hands. <br>  Engineer: Dreamer, you absolutely do not know how to obey, and he who does not know how to obey cannot even command.  I do not understand how you benefit our project with an entrepreneur?  Can you provide your work plan?  Understand, the ideas do not belong to anyone, many also thought about it, the Americans, won, launched such a satellite. <br>  Dreamer: Bye. <br><br>  <i>bulk online newsletter</i> <br>  Engineer: Friends, I hasten to inform you that I am launching a project to create a simplest satellite ... <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/ssUr4ETMW04%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700043,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhT36zLHSy9ST9KYAAmNH5doyJ5eg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <b>"- You have dispelled my sadness and loneliness, traveler.
