  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Vuzix Wrap 920 video glasses - virtual reality or a regular gadget for iPod</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> Recently, I often meet in IT publications and blogs about the appearance of video glasses with support for playing videos from iPhone and iPod.  A few days ago, I was asked to write a review for one online store in which this type of device is present.  Before writing an article, I searched the whole Habr and did not find a single review of video points, so I want to share it with you.  Moreover, in one post there was a mention of this model and in reviews people asked if it was convenient to walk in them, how high-quality the picture was, and so on.  I think that many will be interested to find out what the top-end Wrap 920 model of the well-known Vuzix company, capable of playing video and iPhone / iPod, is. <br><img src="http://www.toproyal.ru/!upload/1(13).jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <strong>A little about the company</strong> <br><br>  After the start of successful sales of innovative video glasses Vuzix Wrap 310, supporting video playback from the iPhone, the company announced a new model - Wrap 920. At the moment it is the older model in the Wrap line.  Soon another glasses from this series will go on sale - Wrap 920AR, which among other things is supplied with two cameras with a resolution of 752 x 480 for video recording.

      The American company <a href="http://vuzix.com/">Vuzix has</a> been the manufacturer of video glasses and has been on the market for 9 years, but only since 2005 it began producing a series of video glasses for a wide range of consumers, and received an award for its invention Vuzix V920. <br>  The range of models is presented by models: iWear, Wrap and special glasses for medical and military needs.  The iWear series is widely represented on the Russian market.  Depending on the model, iWear provide an opportunity to observe a virtual screen from 44 ‚Äùto 62‚Äù at a distance of 3 meters.  They are not bad for watching videos on portable DVD-players, game consoles, laptops, etc. Only the appearance of such a device can cause great interest and surprised looks of passers-by. <br><br><img src="http://www.toproyal.ru/!upload/2(2).jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  But back to our ‚Äúculprit‚Äù review.  What is striking is the appearance of the Wrap 920 video glasses. They really look like sunglasses, like the other glasses in this series.  But more about that later, after opening the package. <br><br>  <strong>Equipment</strong> <br><br>  Medium-sized packaging, all the necessary information is listed on the back of the box. <br><br><img src="http://www.toproyal.ru/!upload/3(4).jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="http://www.toproyal.ru/!upload/123.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  We open and retrieve the following items: video glasses, soft case for glasses, wired remote control, composite AV-adapter, RCA cable, headphones with two additional nozzles (S and L), two Duracell batteries, instruction in English and warranty card. <br><img src="http://www.toproyal.ru/!upload/1234.JPG" alt="image"><br>  A good set, but there is one "but".  To connect Vuzix video glasses with a laptop or computer via the VGA port, you will need to purchase an additional Wrap VGA Adapter, which is not included in the standard package.  It will have to be ordered separately, which is quite problematic to do in Russian stores. <br><br><img src="http://www.toproyal.ru/!upload/1(11).jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <strong>Technical characteristics of Vizux Wrap 920:</strong> <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ 67-inch virtual screen, "visible" at a distance of about 3 m; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Resolution 640 x 480 pixels, 16 million colors; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Support for 2D and 3D video formats; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Adjustable image settings: contrast, brightness, color saturation <br>  ‚Ä¢ Compatible with formats: PAL and NTSC; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Low energy consumption; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Operating time from two AA batteries - up to 6 hours; <br>  ‚Ä¢ High-quality noise insulation system in the headphones; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Manage settings using the OSD menu; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Can be used with or without glasses; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Adjust the focus for the visually impaired.  Range: +2 to -5 diopters; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Customizable hypoallergenic nose bridge <br>  ‚Ä¢ Weight: 85 grams <br><br>  Quite good performance for this class of devices.  Not every video glasses can boast a screen resolution of 640 x 480 pixels, support for 3D-mode and connection to the iPod.  In theory, the image quality should be on top.  In fact ... But more on that below. <br><br>  <strong>Design and appearance</strong> <br><br>  As I said, the device really looks like sunglasses, though the distance between the bridge of the nose and the screen of glasses is quite large.  From the design of the series iWear not a trace.  The lenses are black and opaque.  The bow handles are pleasant to the touch and soft rubber lining.  The wire can be attached to one of the bows, so as not to interfere with the use of glasses when watching a video. <br><br><img src="http://www.toproyal.ru/!upload/11111.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="http://www.toproyal.ru/!upload/22222(1).jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Video glasses support change of focal length for people with impaired vision.  Adjust the focal length by adjusting the screws on the top of the frame.  In this case, a small plastic screwdriver for adjustment is included.  But, as it turned out, finding it is not so easy.  It is located on the back of the control panel.  In addition, glasses can be used together with conventional medical, which has a sufficient distance between the bridge of the nose and mini-screens. <br><br><img src="http://www.toproyal.ru/!upload/qwerty.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="http://www.toproyal.ru/!upload/asdfg.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  As for the quality of the materials used, it deserves high praise.  The plastic used in the model Wrap 920 is sufficiently durable and flexible, there is no pleasant ‚Äúvelvet‚Äù coating on the bows, there are no gaps or backlashes.  The bow is adjustable.  The frame of the handle can change its position with a slight pressure of the fingers, while it is quite hard and without additional effort will not change form by itself.  In addition, the bow can move in a plane perpendicular to the screen, which allows you to position the glasses further from the eyes. <br><br>  <strong>Sound</strong> <br><br>  Next to the mini-screens are the headphone jacks with in-channel design.  The design resembles the similar Sennheiser CX300.  It allows you to place the headphones directly inside the ear canal, providing a minimum distance between the radiating membrane and the eardrum, as well as a high level of sound insulation, compared with conventional droplets.  For each headphone has its own connector, so you can disconnect them if you watch videos without sound (if there are such fans) or photos.  The quality of the reproduced sound will satisfy the needs of most buyers, but they are still far from the Sennheiser CX300.  The sound is comparable to the standard headphones that come bundled with most mp3 players.  The low weight of the headphones and comfortable fit ensure high comfort.  Included are additional attachments with sizes S and L. It is embarrassing only that each earphone ends with a 2.5 minijack.  If you lose one of the headphones, it will be difficult to find a replacement for him. <br><br><img src="http://www.toproyal.ru/!upload/!P2082565(1).jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <strong>Management and OSD menu</strong> <br><br>  The image and sound parameters are controlled using a special remote controller to which the Wrap 920 needs to be connected. As I have already mentioned, there is a screwdriver on the back of the console for adjusting the focal length. <br><br>  To adjust the volume, just press the left and right arrow buttons.  In this case, the volume level menu appears on the points screen.  Image adjustment is also performed from the remote control by pressing the ‚Äú+‚Äù or ‚Äú-‚Äú buttons.  Available settings: brightness, contrast, color saturation, the inclusion of 3D support, the inclusion of automatic support for 3D mode (if there is a special marker in the original image).  In addition, in the upper right corner displays the battery charge.  Adjustment of settings takes place in a wide range, which allows to achieve fairly saturated colors. <br>  Now smoothly we pass to the most important function of video glasses, namely, the quality of the reproduced picture. <br><br>  <strong>Picture</strong> <br><br>  For the test, an iPhone with one of the latest films was used: ‚ÄúSherlock Holmes‚Äù in DVDRip quality. <br>  Vuzix Wrap 920 support high resolution for devices of this class - 640x480 pixels.  What in practice?  Pixels are slightly noticeable and do not pay attention to them at all.  The technical specifications indicate that the reproduced image corresponds to a size of 67 ‚Äùdiagonally at a distance of 3 meters.  It's hard not to agree with this, the screen is really decent.  It seems that you are in a small cinema and sitting in the center of the room (especially if the movie is interesting), but for the best effect, it is advisable to be in a dimly lit room.  With bright daylight, using video glasses is not as comfortable as we would like. <br>  Image lacks saturation.  Partially this problem can be solved by the menu settings, but they do not completely correct it.  It is recommended when you first view immediately play with the settings.  Glasses are more likely to be suitable for a pleasant stay while traveling, rather than for professional purposes and demanding of image quality and sound of people. <br>  Vuzix boasts support for 3D-mode.  In order to experience all the beauty of 3D-pictures, it is necessary to focus the view into the distance, otherwise the impression of the three-dimensional image disappears.  As for the rest, the picture resembles that similar to that which can be obtained in cinemas by using cardboard glasses with two light filters. <br><img src="http://www.toproyal.ru/!upload/P2082569(1).jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <strong>Conclusion</strong> <br><br>  So let's summarize.  The new development of the company Vuzix - Wrap 920 stands out against the background of other products primarily by its design.  These video glasses really look like ... sport sunglasses.  For the design, you can safely put a solid top five.  Glasses sit comfortably enough, but relatively heavy functional parts make themselves felt through a long time wearing.  Weight is concentrated in the bridge of the nose, so you can‚Äôt run on a treadmill watching another film because they strive to fly all the time.  On the other hand, the gadget can be suitable for watching movies in a more comfortable environment, for example, when traveling in a train, car (not driving), flight, or just for home use.  When watching a movie, you really get the impression that you are looking at the big screen, but you must first get used to focusing your gaze into the distance, otherwise there will be the impression that the two screens slightly overlap each other.  The image does not have full color rendering.  The display of white can be compared with the first plasma TVs, in which a slightly beige tint corresponded to white.  Also, do not expect picture clarity.  The image is rather slightly ‚Äúblurred‚Äù.  The remaining parameters of the image are adjustable and allow you to achieve a sufficiently contrast picture. <br><br>  From <a href="http://www.toproyal.ru/catalog/televizory-video/videoochki/videoochki-vuzix-wrap-920/">Vuzix Wrap 920 is</a> not worth waiting for an incredibly high quality picture and sound.  Apparently it is still too early to expect picture quality from devices of this class, satisfying the most demanding users.  The glasses are rather a high-tech gadget that will allow you to pass the time on the road, watching movies on your favorite iPhone.  They can also be an original gift for both adults and children (if nothing else comes to mind). <br>  If you have any questions - please contact.  I will be glad to answer!
