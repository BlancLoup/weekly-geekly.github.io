Everything that you have read so far is not true.  It began in July 1989.  You can celebrate not only the decade of Demos, but also the decade of the Internet in Russia! <br><br>  This was done by two people at the department in IPK Minavtoproma.  These are Vadim Antonov, Dmitry Volodin and the late Leo Tomberg from Tallinn. <br><br>  First, we launched the mail inside our complex.  This happened before.  V.Antonov "repaired" a bunch of programs, including UUCP and mailx.  D. Volodin was acquainted with L. Thomberg, a relative (friend?) Of whom worked at the University of Helsinki.  So, the beginning of the Internet in Russia should be considered the day when Dima Volodin phoned the site administrator and registered our department on the host of the University of Helsinki.  The traffic was very simple - then there were FREE Soviet times - there was ONE phone in the department and we were connected to the Helsinki host by INTERNATIONAL traffic. </blockquote><br>  ¬© Davidov M.I.

    <blockquote>  In 1982-1983 at the Institute of Atomic Energy.  I.V. Kurchatov with the participation of specialists from a number of other research institutes began work on the creation of a domestic operating system like UNIX.  The goal was simple - to Russify UNIX and adapt it to the harsh Russian iron.  The system received the unofficial name of UNAS.  Say, UNIX is for them, and UNAS is for us.  Then the system was found the more official name of DEMOS - Dialogue Unified Mobile Operating System (the name was invented by the teacher of MEPI VV Vasilkov).  In parallel, UNIXa was involved in the Russification at the Institute of Advanced Training of the Ministry of Automotive Industry, in the local dialect the system was called MNOS (Machine Independent Operating System).  Later, the two teams merged, and in February 1989, a group of specialists from the Advanced Training Institute of the Ministry of Automotive Industry and the IV Kurchatov Institute of Atomic Energy organized one of the very first cooperatives in Russia for software development and computer network development - Demos.  Its first product was the Demos system.  The heroes who created it were: Vadim Antonov, Sergey Leontyev, Dima Volodin, Alexey Rudnev, Valera Bardin, Sergey Anshukov, Alexey Dolbin, Leonid Egoshin.  In the following years, DEMOS began to be put on different machines - first on the SM-4, then on Electronics-1082, Elbrus, the EU - on everything that existed in our country at that time.  Such a great job did not go unnoticed; the developers of DEMOS were awarded the prize of the Council of Ministers of the USSR in science and technology. </blockquote><br>  ¬© Foundation for Internet Development <br><br><blockquote>  <b>On September 19, 1990,</b> the first level domain <b>.su</b> was registered in the database of the International InterNIC Information Center.  As a result, the Soviet Union became visible to the entire Internet world.  <b>On April 7, 1994, the</b> Russian <b>.RU</b> domain name was already registered with InterNIC.  Since then, the existence of the Internet in the Russian Federation has been officially certified at the international level. </blockquote><br>  ¬© Foundation for Internet Development <br><br>  As for the domains, the first were: <br><ul><li>  <b>kiae.su</b> - RRC Kurchatov Institute <br>  <b>demos.su</b> - Demos <br>  <b>relcom.su</b> - Relcom <br><br>  Bonuses: <br><blockquote>  Well, I also know that in 1993 the Division of Mathematics of the Russian Academy of Sciences hooked up a SLIP to a sprintnet, and from freenet from Mendkovich a guy went to visit us (Mironov? I don‚Äôt remember) and told what WWW is.  And he already had this www in his frinet, and we only had an ftp-server and <br>  gopher-server since the summer of 1993.
