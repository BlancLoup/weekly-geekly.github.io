  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to protect yourself from time-sink sites?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I think many freelancers and not only asked this question.  First I wrote a whole paragraph of text, and then I thought why should I pour water?  In general, here are the specifics: <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  1. First, we need to identify the kidnappers of time, this will help us: <br>  rescuetime.com - show time spent on both sites and programs, <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/54a/51b/143/54a51b143413a6eca8ec8dc2fe74f6d9.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  or Chrome plugin for "Time Tracker" - will give information only on sites. <br><br>  2. Now we need to protect ourselves <b>during business hours</b> from distracting websites and programs.  Those.  need a program that will close us access to these sites from 9:00 to 18:00. <br>  At first I used the Chrome ‚ÄúStayFocusd‚Äù plugin, it was good for everyone but one - it was turned off with one mouse click, even the browser did not need to be restarted (thanks to chrome :).  In addition, you could run FF and open any site from there. <br>  Then I thought that all this resembles programs that restrict children's access to certain sites (parental control), found several options, of which I liked trafficwasher.ru. <br>  Features: <br>  There is a white list of sites - see below, for which it was useful. <br>  There is a black list of sites - you can specify the time when you can not visit them, and when you can. <br>  There is a black list of programs - you can also specify the time when you can not attend them, and when you can. <br>  There are still different functions, but they are not interesting for our tasks. <br>  Having configured everything as it should, do not forget to give the password from the program to a friend, otherwise it does not make sense. <br><img src="http://www.trafficwasher.ru/screenshots/tw_web_filter.gif" alt="image">
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      <b>Further, the water is not required to read</b> , just do not know how to briefly describe: <br>  I installed it, I used it, I bought it, everything seemed fine, but I lacked one function that I found in StayFocusd - the so-called Nuclear Mode (Nuclear Option).  Turning it on, in the next hour you can open only sites from the white list.  If you need to focus on a specific task - it would be very useful, right?  In trafficwasher.ru there are the beginnings of this function, in the screenshot above a tick "Allow only these sites", but having set up the program, I gave the password to a friend, so that there would be a temptation to turn off the program if you really want to classmates or habr :).  So, it was necessary to bring this opportunity to the tray program, I wrote to the developers, I wrote it three times, then I called and finally they agreed and made a special version. <br>  <a href="">www.trafficwasher.ru/files/trafwashinst_1hour.exe</a> - unfortunately it has already been deleted, but if you write to them - I think they will. <br><br>  3. And for a snack a couple of useful plug-ins for Chrome in my opinion: <br>  Goddamn Work is a simple plugin that shows the remaining time until the end of the working day. <br>  TimerSet - write a task, specify how much you are willing to spend on it and start, the stopwatch shows the remaining time.  For example, I have just indicated that I will spend 30 minutes on writing this article, I have a window that shows that the time is over and the time overrun is 7 minutes.  56 sec.  - continues to tick. <br>  ChromoDoro - for those who use "tomato technique."  By the way, it also helps, a sense of time appears. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/112144/">https://habr.com/ru/post/112144/</a></p>
