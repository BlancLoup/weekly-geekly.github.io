This is only a test of the hypothesis.  But, I hope, many representatives of online stores will appreciate our offspring, especially since the service is free. <br><br>  Part of our team participated in the creation of several large online stores.  We have extensive experience in working with suppliers and, accordingly, in online trading.  It all started with small online stores, a meager assortment and a small number of suppliers. <br><br>  Most business processes have not yet been automated.  The key stage of process automation was the transition to 1C.

      By that time, the company had a staff of over 50 people.  Among all the enormous amount of work on content improvement, personnel training, building a company structure and expanding the range of products, there were insignificant, at first glance, problems that we left for later. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  One of these problems is the daily operational interaction with suppliers.  Let me explain: this is the work with the requests that the online store creates daily for suppliers during the working day.  Inquiries such as clarifying availability, questions about the product, placing the goods in the reserve. <br><br>  Examples of requests made via ICQ or Skype: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/dbb/210/b0d/dbb210b0d3d7d67cda40dceec4e41cd4.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c1a/019/20b/c1a01920b5bb405d15ef4dd73513fb11.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/0c4/36a/6c6/0c436a6c641386888e72fdc8687ee5d7.png"><br><br>  In the online store, requests are handled either by the sales manager himself (a consultant on the phone), or by someone from the purchasing department, it depends on the size of the enterprise.  But with the growth of the company, the problem does not go anywhere and there are more requests.  Therefore, the staff of managers have to expand.  This can occur both from suppliers and from online stores. <br><br>  The whole cycle of the exchange of requests, as a rule, occurs through e-mail, ICQ, telephone.  As it turned out after a detailed review of the process, employees have to perform many unnecessary actions in order to fulfill a simple request. <br><br>  Here is a sample list of actions: <br><ul><li>  Constant change of browser windows; </li><li>  Transition from one ICQ conversation to another in the mail; </li><li>  Search for the beginning of correspondence in the archive; </li><li>  Opening of files of the remains and search there the necessary article, etc .; </li></ul><br>  And all this happens for each person according to a different algorithm and at a different speed.  In addition, not many people can customize, for example, mail for their business tasks.  And ICQ is not even intended for business tasks, especially operating ones.  As a result, the whole picture with endless correspondences is presented to the manager in an inconvenient and incomprehensible format for perception. <br><br>  It was decided to come up with some kind of software solution in order to facilitate the everyday work of managers-operators.  We looked at the logic of communication between managers of online stores with suppliers and came to the conclusion that a certain standard should be proposed for the exchange of such typical messages (requests). <br><br>  A few months went work on the service, there was a lot of corrections and improvements.  Now you can start using the beta version of the <a href="http://www.tradetab.ru/">service</a> . <br><br><h4>  A few words about the work of the service </h4><br><br><ul><li>  The online store creates reserve requests, clarification of availability, a question about the product, always using a single request form, then sends it to a specific supplier. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b4c/c9e/6a4/b4cc9e6a4bea6539fdd1ecc108d24290.png" alt="Online store creates reserve requests"><br><br></li><li>  The supplier receives a request from all of its online stores also in a single format. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/72d/44d/a01/72d44da01411060e81509d38d1f95f53.png" alt="The provider receives a request from all of its online stores."><br>  Communication with counterparties is simplified, the speed of processing requests grows, the quality of processing is improved, thanks to the use of a single data format. <br><br></li><li>  The service keeps all correspondence, you can quickly find or sort the necessary entry by the fields ‚Äúarticle‚Äù, ‚Äúsupplier‚Äù, ‚Äúmanager‚Äù. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/457/8c9/eac/4578c9eaca0a580513009ad8badca7ca.png" alt="The b2b service keeps all correspondence with the manager."><br><br></li><li>  You can see how much the request came from the counterparty and how much was answered to it. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1d0/01a/620/1d001a6209120e67c9650fccf8de2f2e.png" alt="in the b2b system, you can see how much the request came from the counterparty"><br><br></li><li>  The supplier can store balances and update them as many times as necessary throughout the day so that online stores always have up-to-date information. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b62/540/7a8/b625407a8c86bd4a7c2ac9b4e55a28fe.png" alt="in the b2b system agora, the supplier can store the residues and update them"><br><br></li></ul><br><br>  Dear readers, to anyone who represents an online store or supplier company that works with online stores, please express your opinion on this tool.  And for those who need it, I propose to start using the beta version of the <a href="http://www.tradetab.ru/">service</a> for free and for an arbitrarily long time.
