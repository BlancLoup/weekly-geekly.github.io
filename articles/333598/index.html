  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Cold calls for web studio. Lead for 159 rubles a reality or fantasy?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  A lot of businessmen express their loud "fi" cold calls.  It is understandable.  You call a stranger, distract him, try to sell when he does not need it.  For the caller, this is stress, many refuse, and they can send.  And for the business owner additional problems: what will his people say, where to get such armor-piercing employees. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Does it work? </h2><br>  The main purpose of this text is to tell you that cold calls are still working, to show by example how to set up your call center, how to find employees, how to arrange the text of the conversation, and, most importantly, how much it costs. <br><br>  Applications - one of the key points of business development.  No interest - no sales!  Of course, you, as a web studio, are quite capable, by virtue of your own competencies, to shake your website, but the situation is different with calls. <br><br>  So, in order for you to read the article to the end, I‚Äôll show you how it works in numbers.  For example, <b>163 leads</b> - (the person who expressed interest) we called this year. <br>  <b>25%</b> is sales from cold calls from the total number of sales. <br>  <b>2 days are</b> required to find an operator <br>  <b>4 hours</b> required to fully train him <br>  Of course, this all works if the system is debugged.

    <h2>  Where to begin? </h2><br>  I hold this opinion: to start, start at least somehow.  That is what I did.  I myself took the phone, called the directory and just offered to meet.  The payoff was very good.  For a couple of hours I could have scheduled three meetings without scripts, trainings and other training.  But this only works if you are interested.  I mean, if you are a business owner. <br><br>  Inspired by this success, I decided to hire people who would call.  Thus, I launched the call center twice in 2014 and in 2016.  So, my first recruits, and there were 3 of them, I said: "here's your phone, call" and roughly outlined the objections.  The entire script occupied one A4 A4 page.  Three managers with a salary of 10 000 rubles.  and a premium of 100 rubles.  3 appointments per day were scheduled for the appointment!  I incurred colossal expenses, but there was no sales.  After a while, I had to dissolve them, as there was not enough money.  The position of the company was difficult and I threw all my strength into making holes.  The idea that cold calls are working did not leave me.  I did it myself, the experience of my colleagues also spoke about positive results.  Two years later, I approached this issue differently, given my past experience. <br><br><h2>  What to say? </h2><br>  So, the basis of the basics of cold calls is a competent script, this is the name of the text that the operator is talking on the phone.  Here is the script for the operator.  The bar to the left is the conversation plan.  In the center - the text, which is voiced by the client and response options, on the right objections. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/792/fc0/032/792fc00321f0d6d4469dbaa0f5b22a7d.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Thus, the operator does not need any specific knowledge to get started.  He needs to go through this document several times, look at possible developments.  Fortunately, all people behave in the same way and there are not so many variations of the development of dialogue.  This script ‚Äúcloses for a meeting‚Äù - in the bird language of scriptologists it means that the operator‚Äôs goal is to arrange a meeting. <br><br><h2>  How to find an operator? </h2><br>  Finding a person was extremely easy. <br><br>  First, the job offer was very profitable.  We offered to work only half a day - from 10 to 14 and from 14 to 18. This is great for mothers with children who are bored at home or just need a little part-time job.  The same vacancy is suitable for students for additional work after couples.  In addition, to start a career is an excellent experience. <br><br>  From my experience of hiring and training operators, only those who do not know what a browser is, where to press the ‚Äúplay‚Äù button in the player and those who read by syllables, are not suitable.  These really were.  And those who did not have the courage to dial the number for the first time.  For them it was very scary. <br><br>  For this kind of work, 10,000 rubles is offered.  per month.  Payment is fully piecework.  Each conversation is charged 5 rubles, provided that they pick up the phone and the dialogue lasted more than 11 seconds.  It is during such a time that you can manage to say at least something.  Untargeted calls are not paid, for example, if they are in the apartment.  Such cases on the usual penny base from the Internet 1-2 per month. <br><br>  It turns out that the morning operator calls 100 times a day for the finished script, and then the evening call 100 times.  For comparison, in the past, the sales department made 100 calls a person per day.  I realized that 8 hours to call very hard.  And if two people can make 200 attempts, then one during this time a maximum of 130. <br><br>  <i><b>Anecdote to the topic:</b></i> <br>  <i>If a girl is sent to the forest to pick berries, she will bring 5 kg.</i>  <i>If you send a boy to the forest, he will collect 3 kg of berries.</i>  <i>But this does not mean that if you send two of them into the forest for berries, they will bring 8 kg of berries.</i> <br><br>  <b>Here are the results of one randomly selected week for calls:</b> <br>  January 14-20 <br>  Lida 25 <br>  The cost of communication is 1456 rubles. <br>  Payment operators 2515 rubles. <br>  Only 3971 rubles. <br>  The price of the application is 159 rubles. <br><br><h2>  How not to be afraid of cold calls? </h2><br>  The best way that I use is to hire someone to call.  If you are just at the beginning of the journey and you have nothing to hire for anything to say, then you will have to call yourself. <br><br>  The easiest way, which I invented myself, is to clearly understand that they are not denying to you personally, but companies.  You remain the same wonderful, interesting person, but as an employee of this company you were refused today.  Unfortunately, as it turned out later, I was far from being the first to think about it.  Very far. <br><br>  There are cases when a person simply cannot overcome the fear of speaking.  And even the motivation to stay hungry is not enough.  There is nothing you can do.  If this is an employee, then say goodbye to this.  If this is you, then configure Direct and receive inboxes. <br><br>  In conclusion, I want to say that in our company there is a successful experience in introducing cold calls. <br><br>  One sales person is enough for one sales manager.  Lidov with telephone calls will be more than enough for constant workload.  For example, an operator can schedule from 3 to 5 meetings per day.  The manager is able to meet only 3 people.  But besides this, there are callbacks on decisions, preparation of commercial ones. <br><br>  I describe the main conclusions to which I came. <br><br><ul><li>  Such a system is easy to scale.  You invite another operator and another manager - your income grows. <br><br></li><li>  Low price lead.  According to our data, this is the cheapest way except for word of mouth and native seo.  There is no dependence on demand - the season or non-season.  There are meetings both before the New Year and after.  For example, we had meetings on December 30 and January 9. <br><br></li><li>  It is a little difficult to organize everything for the first time, as in any field.  But as soon as it turned out, managing and editing is easy. <br><br></li><li>  In cold contacts below the conversion to the sale.  Indeed, a person is interested in the process of calling and further negotiations.  But due to the fact that he is not the initiator of the contact cycle of the transaction a little longer and the number of sales is less. </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/333598/">https://habr.com/ru/post/333598/</a></p>
