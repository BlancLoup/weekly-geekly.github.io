For the first, you can suffer personally and physically, for the rest - to grab problems like a grocery company.  Design debt is intentionally or unintentionally accumulated usability problems, the solution of which is postponed until future versions.  As a result, users suffer, and they, although patient, eventually jump off and never return.  There are several examples of a systems approach: Nielsen / Norman Group, Truven Health, Athena Health, Salesforce, Optimizely. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/11f/675/497/11f6754979b0d340ed99295ad37683df.png"><br><br><h4>  <a href="https://progressionpack.com/">Progression pack</a> </h4><br>  A tool for assessing the competencies of designers and their development.

He says that designers have long had a seat at the key decision-making table, but are afraid to take full advantage of it.  In addition, self-conceit in the spirit of ‚Äúwe are the only ones aware of users‚Äù makes it difficult to realize that there are many such roles in the modern product team and they are no less valuable. <br><br><h4>  <a href="https://medium.com/design-ibm/playback-on-design-thinking-not-just-for-designers-7812f5052099">Playback on Design Thinking - Not Just For Designers</a> </h4><br>  IBM's Kelly Churchill continues the story of how design thinking helped front-end developers.
