The importance of combating piracy and copyright protection is understood by all major Internet companies.

      On June 21, 2013, the State Duma adopted a law ‚ÄúOn Amendments to the Legislative Acts of the Russian Federation on the Protection of Intellectual Rights in Information and Telecommunication Networks‚Äù.  Under this long and complex name lies no less confusing and vague language that can be interpreted as you please, but not in favor of those who are affected by this law.  At the same time, it concerns ALL: ordinary users, providers, Russian business, the Internet industry, and, of course, the right holders themselves. <br><br>  The adoption of the law has caused quite an expected <a href="http://rublacklist.net/5773/">response</a> from the numerous participants in Russian business.  We have also repeatedly expressed our position on the issue (in <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/russian/rolling_news/2013/07/130703_rn_putin_antipirate_law.shtml">public address</a> and in the <a href="http://www.vedomosti.ru/tech/news/14011861/piratskij-spisok">comments</a> ).  However, lawmakers ignored all attempts to amend and at least somehow correct the law in the direction of common sense. <br><br>  And now the "anti-piracy" law has entered into force.  Today we live in such an Internet reality, where any user has become an information intermediary, and any resource can be blocked for a link to pirated content. <br><br>  <strong>For inquisitive</strong> <br><br>  You can get acquainted with the law <a href="http://www.rg.ru/2013/07/10/pravo-internet-dok.html">here</a> .  We describe some of the possible consequences of its use: <br><br>  - Sites that are considered "unscrupulous" can be blocked by IP or domain name.  This means that when blocking by IP, other unsubstantiated resources located on the same IP address will also be automatically blocked, and if blocked by a domain name, the entire resource may be blocked due to one page or one material on a resource. <br><br>  - You can block the site on suspicion of violation.  That is, your fault has not yet been proven, and you have already been closed. <br><br>  - Any attacker (for example, an unfair competitor) can leave a comment on your site with a link to the object of copyright or related rights.  This is enough to cover the resource in the framework of "interim measures". <br><br>  <strong>What remedies are good</strong> <br><br>  The edits that we propose to make are based on international experience and mechanisms that work in the West, as well as on what has already been gained in Russia. <br><br>  We have been working with copyright holders for a long time and effectively.  On the one hand, we already have contracts for the use of licensed content on our sites and we continue to work on forming a pool of partners.  On the other hand, we always respond to the official requests of copyright holders and promptly delete their content. <br><br>  We are ready to share our experience and now we are actively participating in the formation of new rules that will work and will allow protecting the right holders not only at our sites, but throughout the runet.  We also support the current campaign, but we believe that millions of users should not suffer because of the lack of access to the services they use daily. <br><br>  We are against the wording adopted in the law, but we intend to convey and defend our point of view, without closing our services and not blocking access to information. <br><br>  We are ready to continue a constructive dialogue and assist in the formation of by-laws that will allow not only to form civilized relations with rightholders, but also to maintain the growth rate of the IT industry, which could become the new driver of the Russian economy. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/188524/">https://habr.com/ru/post/188524/</a></p>
