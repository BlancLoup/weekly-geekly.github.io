Now not only ordinary plastic parts are printed, but also <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/178641/">ears</a> , and even pistols.  If you think that this is a toy, you are mistaken.  Liberator is the first gun in the world, all parts of which are printed on a 3D printer.  And yes, the creators of this weapon are soon planning to lay out the CAD files for the printer, so that anyone who has such a printer will be able to print firearms.  Sounds weird, right?  But it is so. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  Liberator consists of 16 parts, each of which is printed on a Dimension SST printer using ABS plastic.  The current prototype, as far as can be understood, is capable of shooting cartridges of various caliber, for which it is possible to change some parts.

      At the beginning of the article said that the gun was created solely on the printer.  This, however, is still one detail that was not printed.  This is a piece of metal inserted into plastic.  Metal was needed in order to bring the weapon into conformity with the Undetectable Firearms Act, i.e., the gun must be detected by metal detectors.  In March, by the way, the developers (the non-profit organization Defense Distributed) <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/173391/">received a federal license</a> to manufacture firearms.  So everything is legal. <br><br>  Of course, there is a very high probability that Defense Distributed customers, who received the same CAD file (or any other person who downloaded this file after it appeared on the Web), will be able to print weapons without a serial number, without a metal tab, and other things necessary for compliance with the relevant laws of things.  But here, it seems, nothing can be done - the purpose of this organization was to demonstrate the possibility of creating firearms with their own hands. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/46b/51e/ce8/46b51ece816b0f2c7af167785574b902.png"><br><br>  Among other things, the organization has created and parts for weapons of other types.  For example, these are high capacity stores for AR-15s and AK-47s, as well as a case for an AR-15 rifle, to which you can attach a barrel and magazine, having received your own rifle without any problems. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/tAW72Y_XPF4%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhvzOknKX-TBNmWXL0SBXJUl5exlA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  It is clear that Cody Wilson, the head of Defense Distributed, immediately became the object of criticism of both ordinary citizens and officials of various stripes.  Now even an amendment to the Undetectable Firearms Act (USA) is proposed, with additions for ‚Äúprinted‚Äù weapons and weapon parts. <br><br>  But to the main question, ‚ÄúCan anyone with the advent of 3D printers on the market sell a gun for themselves?‚Äù Cody Wilson has already answered.  The answer is not just positive, it is supported by convincing evidence in the form of ready-made weapons.  What will happen next?  It's not clear yet. <br><br>  It may well be that in the United States will ban plastic weapons.  But who can check out thousands of garages and basements, where, in fact, you can create mini-gun factories?  Also unclear. <br><br>  Via <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/andygreenberg/2013/05/03/this-is-the-worlds-first-entirely-3d-printed-gun-photos/%3Futm_campaign%3Dtechtwittersf%26utm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dsocial">forbes</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/178745/">https://habr.com/ru/post/178745/</a></p>
