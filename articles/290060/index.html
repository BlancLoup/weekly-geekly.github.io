Words are accompanied by facial expressions, a certain intonation and appropriate pauses.  All these details help the listener to draw correct conclusions regarding the information he has heard. <br><br>  Quite different things when communicating online, because the interlocutors often not only do not see each other, but do not hear.  In this case, to grasp the meaning and tone of the message is much more difficult, so it is important for both parties to make additional efforts to convey them.  One way to improve the situation is to use smiles and punctuation. <a name="habracut"></a>

    <h4>  Smile smiley discord </h4><br>  Despite the fact that smiles are great for livening up online correspondence, the attitude towards them is rather ambiguous.  Some use them very often, others dislike it.  The latter are often convinced that smiles are at least inappropriate when communicating with customers. <br><br>  However, practice shows that a smiling face in the response of an employee is sometimes more than welcome.  Another thing is that sculpt smiles right and left is not worth it, because each client responds to them differently. <br><br>  How "smiling" will be your manner of writing, you need to determine the initial message of the client.  It all depends on his mood, style of communication and the specific situation. <br><br>  Consider a few examples. <br><br>  <b>1)</b> A <b><i>large corporate client appeals</i></b> for support and quite officially asks a question.  The answer must be discreet and clear.  Use exclamation marks and emoticons are not washed away. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8da/b50/ec7/8dab50ec799741b0a5ba2dc4c50088bb.png"><br><br>  <b>2)</b> The client <b><i>describes in his message a serious problem</i></b> .  Obviously, he is not in the best of spirits.  Do not try to cheer him up with smiles.  First you need to fix the problem, and then, based on the reaction of the client, decide how "friendly" the next answer will be. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7b2/be4/c85/7b2be4c8582e437185ddab9752c18635.png"><br><br>  <b>3) The</b> user contacts the support service <b><i>with the most common question</i></b> .  In such situations, the use of smiles is permissible, especially if they clearly fall into place. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/167/4b8/764/1674b876483c4b82a2590d56d478ffac.png"><br><br>  <b>4)</b> The client <b><i>writes enthusiastically and emotionally</i> about</b> .  It is worth answering in a similar way to be on the same wavelength with it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/49d/ed9/9e6/49ded99e65c243b28c174aa0da7e2c88.png"><br><br>  <b>5)</b> The client <b><i>does not stint at smiles and exclamations at all</i></b> .  No need to go into euphoria with him.  The answer should be a little more restrained. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8b4/1d5/f4d/8b41d5f4d0af4d5a9e360d4d99a1eb87.png"><br><br>  When communicating with customers, extremes are too positive or too negative answers.  <i>Emotional coloring of the client's letter should always remain half a tone higher than your answer.</i> <br><br><h4>  Do not do without emotions? </h4><br>  Perhaps someone will disagree with the fact that in online communication with customers the emotional component is of great importance, since the main thing is to satisfy the client's request. <br><br>  Nevertheless, in our time, timely and full-fledged assistance to the client represents, rather, the necessary minimum, and not a reason for pride.  To really stand out from the crowd, you need to do more than the rest. <br><br>  <i>Human attitudes and a subtle emotional adjustment to the client are just as additional efforts that outweigh the hour of the scales in your favor.</i> <br><br>  Take for example two situations. <br><br>  <b>but.</b>  A person comes to the company, pays money and wants to get a certain service.  The employee solves his question in good faith, but at the same time he answers dryly and officially.  Despite the fact that the client fully receives what he has paid for, he still has an easy feeling of dissatisfaction, the presence of which he may not even be aware of. <br><br>  <b>b.</b>  The client comes for the desired service, and receives, in addition to her, a pleasant and relaxed communication with the employee.  It would seem such a trifle, but it may well charge with positive energy for the whole day. <br><br>  Similar situations are observed with online customer service.  It happens a little differently, but the client, reading the answer of the employee, also has some feelings.  Therefore, the form and manner of communication is very important. <br><br>  No matter how paradoxical it may sound, the <b><i>most important thing is what kind of feelings your client caused your feelings, because they, and not words, will be remembered</i></b> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/290060/">https://habr.com/ru/post/290060/</a></p>
