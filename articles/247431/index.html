  <section class="page js-page"><h1>NFV network function virtualization</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Google and Microsoft have joined forces with telecommunications companies AT &amp; T and British Telecommunications (BT) to produce the new generation of major packet data networks, starting with the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/184350/">BGP</a> border gateway <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/184350/">protocol</a> .  This is the main dynamic routing protocol, one of the main mechanisms for the functioning of the Internet.  It is an essential component in routing traffic over IP networks, and is of great importance for the speed of deploying network services virtualization (Network Function Virtualization / NFV). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fea/7e7/d18/fea7e7d18ecc4958a4a229296e7515e4.jpg"><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Now one of the most frequently discussed topics in the world of computer networks is the topic of NFV - a new, promising technology.  It allows you to programmatically create such services that are now available only in the form of hardware solutions.  Virtualization of network functions allows you to install services there, then and in the quantity that is required now and in this place.  NFV was created with a focus on service providers, with knowledge of the features of the service providers and their most pressing problems.

      Advantages of NFV: <br><br><ul><li>  allows you to flexibly and dynamically provide new services, while reducing capital and operating costs; </li><li>  replacing equipment with standardized servers and network components does not tie operators to equipment suppliers; </li><li>  reduces operational costs by simplifying monitoring and administration of operations (all network functions are transferred to a single virtualized infrastructure); </li><li>  fast connection of new users to the network; </li><li>  pays for the infrastructure of telecommunications companies. </li></ul><br>  When a service provider creates a connection with a new place there are several devices that must be installed on the network, this is, first of all, a managed router and a Carrier Ethernet demarcation device, which are crucial because they separate the customer‚Äôs network and the operator‚Äôs network.  In addition, they add equipment that must be installed to monitor and control connections and traffic.  In addition to a set of standard equipment already listed above, service providers are often forced to install a number of non-standard devices that are necessary to ensure the client‚Äôs business tasks.  And thus, for the service provider, the purchase and service support of such equipment becomes very labor-intensive, especially since it is hardly possible to plan in advance the level of loading of this equipment.  NFV helps to solve this problem due to the virtualization of network functions in software applications that can be run both on regular servers and on virtual machines running on these servers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/12c/718/e33/12c718e338ce4d9fbaf2f76161d6afe6.png"><br><br>  Virtualization technologies allow you to consider all the IT resources of the organization as a set of public services that can be grouped and re-combined to increase efficiency and rapid scaling.  According to Light Reading, the new model was presented as a project on the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) - an open international community of designers, scientists, network operators and providers, created by <a href="http://www.iab.net/">IAB</a> in 1986, which is engaged in the development of Internet protocols and architecture . <br><br>  Commercial implementation of this project is planned for the near future.  Google already uses a new model inside the company.  Through a social network for GitHub developers, several companies have begun work on a project already developed by Google and contributed to it.  Their task is to ensure the independence of network operators from suppliers, provide the ability to manage BGP configurations, group and combine the routing of software and hardware systems without a long data integration process.  According to operators, GP plays an increasingly important role in building networks using software-defined network (SDN) and network services virtualization (NFV). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cc5/d91/99a/cc5d9199a37241b18c6feb0bd1a54f3c.png"><br><br>  With NFV, the operator can, using just one network interface device to delimit traffic, allow all other functions to be located on the territory of the service provider, and use the SDN to simplify and manage this network for the client. <br><br>  Telecommunications companies are interested in SDN and NFV, as it gives vendor independence, the ability to implement, easily plan and deploy networks using hardware and software that companies can choose.  The use of ready-made standard equipment and virtualization tools for testing and deploying new services takes a few minutes, not months, as it was before. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/247431/">https://habr.com/ru/post/247431/</a></p>
