  <section class="page js-page"><h1>On five screens</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> <a href="https://megafon.tv/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f0e/23d/72f/f0e23d72fc1d9ef28e37a3ee251501f2.jpg"></a> <br><br>  The regiment‚Äôs misconceptions of the beginning of the century arrived: the Internet did not kill television, as blogs could not replace the media - the content level produced by television companies is inaccessible to fans, and television itself has gone over to the offensive and is now mastering the Web, instead of running from it like hell incense.  Even if your TV has long served exclusively as a stand for Netsuke figures in the corner, you can watch news, sports broadcasts and your favorite shows live from your phone, tablet or computer - these are the possibilities offered by the <a href="https://megafon.tv/">MegaFon.TV</a> service.  And it also allows you to rent movies, supports multiscreen - and all this is paid for from your MegaFon mobile account. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  You can watch ‚ÄúMegaFon.TV‚Äù on a tablet and a smartphone through an application for <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.megalabs.megafon.tv">Android</a> and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ru/app/megafon.tv/id635898314">iOS</a> , on a computer through the website megafon.tv and on a TV through a Dune HD media player.  Is that the microwave and not enough, but who knows what else will be? <br><habracut><br>  <b>Mobile TV</b> <br><br>  TV in a mobile phone?  More recently, I could only recall the Chinese Noki clones with retractable TV antennas.  Poor quality of reception and a tiny screen - it always seemed to me more likely to be pampering than the necessary function.  However, now the ‚ÄúMegaFon.TV‚Äù application organically adds the TV function to the phone: right after launch, the last launched TV channel turns on - just like in a regular TV.  No additional tambourine dances - money for viewing is debited directly from the MegaFon mobile number account;  You can manage subscriptions directly from the application.

    <blockquote>  Subscriptions are sets of TV channels that are available on MegaFon.TV.  The package ‚ÄúMain‚Äù includes 58 channels and the first month is available absolutely free of charge;  Prices for other packages vary from 1 to 7 rubles per day, depending on the number of channels in it. </blockquote><br>  The design of the mobile application was developed according to the standard Snowflake, created by NDS (now part of Cisco).  ‚ÄúMegaFon.TV‚Äù was the first in Russia to use Snowflake for TV applications <br><br><blockquote>  Based on the concept of NDS Snowflake, user interfaces for set-top boxes, computers, smartphones, and tablets can be created.  NDS has numerous international awards in ergonomics and design for the Snowflake interface.  It differs from other digital television interfaces in its unique ergonomics: the combination of simplicity and beauty has been achieved, which allows the interface to be used without prior training for both children and the elderly, since all actions are intuitive and a minimum of controls are used for navigation. . </blockquote><br>  The implementation of Snowflake looks at the example of the mobile application ‚ÄúMegaFon.TV‚Äù as follows: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a26/217/c53/a26217c53793539b35c4a82a8c92b5ef.jpg"><br><br>  Pleasant trifle: the menu is displayed over the television picture, neither the broadcast nor the sound is interrupted - it reminds the logic of the menu of modern TVs: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/500/d0a/408/500d0a408b030b67e33d457164060dea.png"><br><br>  There are plenty of application options - let's say, even far from home and sports bars you can watch, for example, an important match when you only have a smartphone at hand: bothering to search for online broadcasts from it is inconvenient, and with ‚ÄúMegaFon.TV‚Äù you only need a stable Wi- Fi. <br><br>  There you can also choose a movie to watch.  The search was made in the form of a rather convenient, but long ribbon of posters: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4bb/384/43f/4bb38443fd629b4c817d2bdc596e472b.png"><br><br>  Perhaps, it lacks only filters that could shorten the search process. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/dbc/bf4/be6/dbcbf4be69d45372cbda98de44acea16.png"><br><br>  After selecting a movie, the application offers to rent it for 48 hours.  It will cost 70 rubles - the price and time are the same for almost the entire film library ‚ÄúMegaFon.TV‚Äù, with rare exceptions - for example, the cartoons ‚ÄúFairy Tale Machines‚Äù go for 15 rubles each.  In this case, the application requires you to enter some code - which, however, does not explain.  Here they are, cons of a concise interface! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8aa/99a/690/8aa99a69087dd3da4c01013b5ebfe4e0.png"><br><br>  You can find out what the code is only on the site - there the developers did not stint on the explanation: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/96a/ec2/029/96aec20294058f159d1ad2cdd3c62fae.jpg"><br><br>  In general, with the exception of such trifles, the application with the functions of a mobile TV copes perfectly.  The interface based on the concept of Snowflake is used on devices and showcases of ‚ÄúMegaFon.TV‚Äù, present and future: set-top boxes, mobile applications, Smart-TV applications. <br><br>  <b>Site</b> <br><br>  <a href="https://megafon.tv/">The site ‚ÄúMegaFon.TV‚Äù is</a> built on more traditional design patterns, but offers the same features as the application.  The choice of TV channels on the site, for obvious reasons, is simpler: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/616/195/7fc/6161957fc9f5bfe41054beb30eefcd9e.jpg"><br><br>  The search for the base of the films also lacks filters - for example, IMDb and Kinopoisk ratings - because with the available sorting options by release date, genre, director and title, good interesting films inevitably go along with every kind of ‚Äúdirect-to-dividy‚Äù thrash, which complicates the search process. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cba/75b/5f2/cba75b5f2c7f7b3ca03945e930778eaf.jpg"><br><br>  In total, there are 133 films in the database, this is 7 pages of search.  With cartoons - 266, the list is already 14 pages. <br><br>  <b>Television</b> <br><br>  Of course, this is the most obvious way to watch TV and movies.  But there is a ‚Äúbut‚Äù: the ‚ÄúMegaFon.TV‚Äù application is currently available only in the Dune Store, which implies the need for a Dune HD prefix. <br><br><blockquote>  The prefix is ‚Äã‚Äãa good thing, includes both a number of interesting applications (for example, the Moskva.FM service, through which I usually listen to the radio in the recording, or the Bittorrent torrent client), and a set of such ‚Äúnecessary‚Äù things for the ‚Äúbox‚Äù as games "Snake" and "Sea Battle".  But not without glitches: let's say Wi-Fi, distributed through the D-Link DIR-320 Dune HD router, did not see, the situation was only saved by replacing the router with the D-Link D150L.  Yes, and the second remote in addition to the main television - the pleasure is dubious. </blockquote><br>  However, this month the MegaFon.TV team promises to release an application for Smart TV, which significantly changes the situation for the better: after all, TVs with Smart TV are already quite a massive phenomenon, and the ability to install the application without buying additional hardware is very valuable.  So far I have not seen this application, but the interface promises similar to its mobile fellow. <br><br>  <b>Multi-screen</b> <br><br>  A natural requirement for such services is the ability to continue playback from one device at the same place where it was stopped at another.  Theoretically, this means that a movie started at home on a TV with Dune HD can be watched on the road on Android or an iOS device, without bothering to remember the pause time and rewind.  Synchronization of viewing video with the site while in development. <br><br>  This feature only applies to content on demand (movies, cartoons).  For TV programs it does not make sense, as they go live. <br><br><blockquote>  Only one subscriber number can connect up to five devices, including TVs, computers and mobile gadgets. </blockquote><br>  <b>The future of "MegaFon.TV"</b> <br><br>  The TV is a magic box that attracts attention just as much as the look of the python Kaa.  Services like ‚ÄúMegaFon.TV‚Äù make television magic all-pervading.  He has room to grow: the application for Smart TV will appear, the film library will be replenished.  Until the end of the year, mobile applications will be able to work via the 3G network.  There will be other interesting features that so far cannot even be announced.  But its main disadvantage from the point of view of subscribers of other operators will be that it is available only to MegaFon users. <br><br><h5>  PS Other MegaLabs lab projects that we talked about in Habr√©: </h5><br><ul><li>  " <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/megafon/blog/191896/">Resource under control</a> " - a system for remote accounting and payment of utility bills </li><li>  " <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/megafon/blog/193392/">Multiphone</a> " - VoIP dialer, combining the advantages of traditional mobile and Internet communications </li></ul></habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/201676/">https://habr.com/ru/post/201676/</a></p>
