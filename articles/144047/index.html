    <h4>  How it works? </h4><br>  With the help of a single USSD request, a phone account (balance) is linked to a virtual card account. <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/_g66oP04PXQ%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700255,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhgsKPk0FeI9jweB5wzIPwlrl14tdw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Here are three examples: <br><ul><li>  <b>You are a freelancer and received money from the customer directly to your cell phone balance</b> .  It is enough to go to an ATM, choose a cash withdrawal, enter the details of a virtual card and receive funds. </li><li>  <b>You want to pay something online, for example, some kind of purchase up to 15 thousand rubles</b> .  A USSD request is sent, a one-time CVV comes to you, which is valid for an hour.  It is both convenient and secure. </li><li>  <b>You want to get the usual plastic, but with reference not to the bank account, but to the balance of the mobile phone</b> .  Such a card can be ordered by calling 0611 or leaving a request on the <a href="">website</a> .  Replenishment of such a card is possible everywhere, similar to replenishing the balance of the phone (including through electronic payments).  By the way, it is especially convenient to transfer money to relatives in other cities. </li></ul><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/eb3/609/abe/eb3609abe31e7e05e945e00aa1518bdd.png"><br>  <i>Virtual card issue</i> <br><br><h4>  How does this differ from the usual Alfa-Bank virtual card? </h4><br><ul><li>  The virtual card associated with the balance is created free of charge. </li><li>  Details are relevant within an hour after the request, after they expire (the card itself is valid for 3 years).  Therefore, the virtual card is safer than usual. </li><li>  The card is not associated with a bank account and does not require authorization in the Internet bank (virtual option). </li><li>  You can top up your account in the same ways as a cell phone balance. </li></ul><br><br><h4>  What else do you need to know about such cards? </h4><br><ul><li>  The number of the received card is not related to your phone number. </li><li>  At any time, you can reissue the card that blocks the current one (especially for paranoids). </li><li>  In the case of a virtual card, it turns out that, in fact, it is always activated for you, but there are not enough details for making purchases on it: CVV2, PIN-code and expiration date.  They are obtained through a USSD request or via SMS.  After receiving the details you have an hour to buy.  If shopping is delayed, you will need to request new details. </li><li>  The card can be used for money transfers (just replenish the mobile phone of the subscriber to whom you want to transfer money, and he will be able to receive cash using his mobile card). </li><li>  It is possible to issue not only a virtual card, but also a real plastic tied to an account according to the same principles (only with permanent details). </li></ul><br><br><h4>  How to issue a plastic card? </h4><br>  A plastic card has all the properties of a regular Visa Classic debit card, but at the same time it is easier to issue.  No need to come to the bank: just call Beeline at the toll-free number 0611 or place an application on the <a href="">website</a> .  Ready personalized card will be delivered by registered mail.  A maximum of two cards can be tied to one phone. <br><br>  As for the rest, as usual, the card has the printed CVV2 and expiration date, and the PIN code is in the envelope issued upon receipt.  To activate, you need to send a USSD request or an SMS from the phone to the balance of which it is attached, with the last 4 digits of the card number itself (this is a measure of loss of the card on the way). <br><br><h4>  How to withdraw cash? </h4><br>  In order to withdraw cash, you first need to pass identification with the bank - such a requirement of the legislation of the Russian Federation.  Up to this point cards are non-personalized.  It is enough to come with a passport to any branch of Alfa-Bank, where the employee identifies you and connects the cash withdrawal service.  It will be possible to withdraw cash, plus the limits will increase by the amount of transactions per month. <br><br>  To withdraw cash using a virtual card, you will need a card number and a PIN code, which can be obtained by dialing the free command * 100 # 22 # call, or by sending an SMS with the word ‚ÄúCODE‚Äù to 0780. In response, you will receive an SMS with a PIN code <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/12e/860/0f0/12e8600f0fcc4ab723e5fa79a59e3e64.png"><br>  <i>Payment</i> <br><br>  Cash withdrawal on a plastic card is similar to the virtual scheme, with the only difference that you do not need to request card details before the operation.  Also on plastic you can withdraw cash at ATMs of any banks, not only at Alfa-Bank. <br><br><h4>  How to quickly activate the service? </h4><br>  You connect to Beeline at a rate, for example, ‚ÄúSimple‚Äù.  Speak the starting balance and after that you can issue a card (if you have been using a SIM card for a long time, you can immediately issue a card).  Send USSD-command * 100 * 21 #, the answer is the card number.  To make a purchase, get the details as a result of the request * 100 * 22 #.  If you want to withdraw cash - go to the bank, you activate the service "Cash withdrawal". <br><br><h4>  Who is available to the service? </h4><br>  The service is available to subscribers with an advance payment system, with the exception of users of the ‚ÄúZero Doubt‚Äù and ‚ÄúSimple Logic‚Äù tariff plans, as well as those who have activated the ‚ÄúMad Days‚Äù and ‚ÄúUnlimited Within Network‚Äù services. <br><br><h4>  Details and details </h4><br><ul><li>  <a href="http://alfabank.ru/f/1/retail/cards/mobilecard/mobile_local_card_tariffs_20120201.pdf">Tariffs</a> for the issue, maintenance and operations using a Mobile Card. </li><li>  <a href="http://alfabank.ru/retail/cards/mobilecard/">Information</a> about the Mobile Map on the Alfa-Bank website. </li><li>  Mobile card information on the RURU website </li><li>  <a href="">Description, tariffs, order</a> on the website "Beeline". </li><li>  <a href="http://alfabank.ru/mobcard/">Description, tariffs</a> (or by phone Alfa-Bank 0780). </li></ul><br>  PS Seeing some misunderstanding in the comments I emphasize once again: the issue of a virtual card is free, and money from it (that is, in fact, from a mobile phone account) can be withdrawn at Alfa-Bank ATMs. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/144047/">https://habr.com/ru/post/144047/</a></p>
