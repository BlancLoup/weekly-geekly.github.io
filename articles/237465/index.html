You can still buy a ticket, but they are fewer.  You know what to do if you have not had time ( <a href="http://railsclub.timepad.ru/event/122386/">here</a> ). <br><br>  Friday interview guest - Kirill Gorin, videobacks developer <a href="http://coub.com/">Coub.com</a> .  The service, allowing to create short looped videos, was launched last year and has already conquered many.  For example, 50 million users per month, more than 300 million views of cobs per month and $ 1 million in the first round of investment.  At the conference, Kirill will talk about the features of working with large files in large quantities, and today we asked him our questions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0d1/beb/d3d/0d1bebd3db622f892b0ca4ae4c8e521e.jpg" alt="image">

      <b>What are you working on right now?</b> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I'm currently working at <a href="http://coub.com/">Coub.com</a> , doing back-end video processing and APIs for it.  Right now we are planning to expand the functionality of working with video and audio on the site and I am updating the backend for this.  Along the way, I‚Äôm doing a new thing to describe an API called RAML, we have very big plans for it, I started writing a parser for it on Ruby, but unfortunately, there are still more priority things to do. <br><br>  <b>What is the best and worst part of your job?</b> <br><br>  It's cool when you manage to implement some thing, from which there is a noticeable result for users, company or development team.  And, by the way, not always the most time-consuming functionality gives such a result - last year I added audio normalization in our kobah, so that the user doesn't have to constantly turn the volume control, it took a couple of days to implement, but the result was very well received by users. <br>  The worst part is the reverse, the best to refactor the old code without tests is not very pleasant, it takes a lot of time and it seems that you are standing around, I think everyone will understand what I mean. <br><br>  <b>What do you consider your main achievement in life / career at the moment?</b> <br><br>  For the time being, I consider it an opportunity to do what a lot of people will use.  Although, for me more important is what lies ahead. <br><br>  <b>In your opinion, in what direction will Ruby and Ruby on Rails develop in the coming years?</b> <br>  Most of all, I personally am waiting for progress in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãconcurrency at MRI. <br><br>  <b>What, in your opinion, is the most important problem that the Ruby and Ruby on Rails developers community is facing now?</b> <br><br>  I think Rails, like any other mature framework, faces the challenge of maintaining relevance and adapting to new trends, while not losing stability and backward compatibility, you need to very clearly understand which chips should be included in the project and which ones will quickly disappear and only become heavier him. <br><br>  <b>Is there a heme you could point your finger at and say: ‚ÄúThat's the way to write code‚Äù?</b> <br><br>  From what immediately comes to mind - rspec. <br><br>  <b>What do you read about Ruby / RoR?</b>  <b>Blog, resource, book?</b> <br><br>  Regularly on Ruby / RoR I look only at Ruby Weekly, periodically - what comes across interesting in blogs.  Now I‚Äôm reading Avdi Grimma‚Äôs Confident Ruby book, I find a lot of interesting things in it - for the most part everything seems to be known, but it helps to structure the thoughts in my head. <br><br>  <b>In your opinion, is there a competition between Ruby / Ruby on Rails and Python / Django?</b>  <b>Or Ruby and Functional Programming Languages?</b>  <b>If it exists, then in what the first surpass the second, and in what are they inferior?</b> <br><br>  If we talk about a bunch of language and framework, in my opinion Ruby on Rails is a more mature platform for commercial development, both by itself and with the ecosystem, at least it was three years ago when Django stopped working and in detail to follow its development.  I have a purely positive opinion about Python and Django, I just think that, on average, for most Ruby on Rails projects is still a better choice.  If we talk about competition, then it seems to me that this is not the right word in this context, each task is its own tool, if you firmly understand why in a particular Python project, then it might be worth using Django.  The same can be said about functional languages, if you don‚Äôt know exactly why and what it will give you, then it‚Äôs better to take a universal tool (for example, Ruby on Rails), quickly make a prototype, work out the idea and think further what suits you better, maybe this ‚Äú multitool "enough for several years. <br><br>  <b>Is it embarrassing for the code that you wrote a few years ago?</b> <br><br>  It is embarrassing for a code that I did not write a few years ago, I am talking about tests. <br><br>  <b>What do you like to do when you don't write code?</b> <br><br>  In winter, I ride a snowboard, when I have free time at home I play Battlefield.  I also plan to collect a bicycle this winter to go to the office, but this is only on paper. <br><br>  <b>Thanks for the interview!</b> <br><br>  This is the kind of charity that was found among Cobs about RoR - <a href="http://coub.com/view/lr34vc">click</a> . <br><br>  Find out how Coub works with large files at a conference on September 27, at the Digital October center.
