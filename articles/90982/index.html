      The following 5 principles will allow you to take steps to ensure that your projects will be completed on time, within budget and successfully.  Read, learn, remember, tell others and make them your habit. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  1. <b>Communication.</b>  If everyone who is involved in your project does not know what he is working on, when he needs to be finished, how it should be done and for whom this product is, then how can you expect success in the project?  All other steps are based on communication.  Expectations, goals, resources, deadlines, priorities, reports and budgets - all this should be available to your team so that it can do its job well.  Tools like web conferencing allow your <a href="http://maps.yandex.ru/-/CBsmb5d">Hyderabad</a> developer to show you his screen in order to precisely reproduce the most terrible mistake in your application. <br><br>  2. <b>Consolidation.</b>  Here we talk about the information and tasks.  Remember your usual day and tell me how often you interrupted in the middle of working on a task in order to do something else;  just be honest.  How much time did you spend looking for one specific letter among the hundreds in your inbox?  And looking for the desired file on the disk, which you forgot where you saved it?  And opening files in search of the latest version or, even worse, working with an outdated version?  Or in search of someone who could explain the essence of the problem?  And on writing reports?  Almost every company is able to improve these processes by reducing the number of garbage tasks and arranging data in convenient access, but it‚Äôs not easy - you will have to change. <br><br>  3. <b>Priorities.</b>  Every day there are tasks, there are errors, a new functionality is invented.  By itself, any of the elements of this list will not be critical for achieving your business goals, but your team does not have the opportunity to know which of the tasks is most important until one of the management tells them about it.  Priorities tell your team how important it is to solve this particular task right now.  Prioritization and compliance with them, whether for a task or a problem, will allow your team to work more efficiently. <br><br>  4. <b>Requirements.</b>  When planning the life cycle of an application and development, you do not have to do anything until you have defined, prioritized, and approved the requirements for your application or project.  Requirements are what your application or project must include in order to meet your business goals.  After these basic steps have been completed, you need to discuss them again with all those involved in the process - with the developers and with the management.  Requirements management should be carried out throughout the project;  poor requirements management leads to various delays and unforeseen expenses. <br><br>  5. <b>Time management.</b>  As with any other management, it is your job to take the first steps in shaping adequate timelines and phases for working on a project for your team.  The key word is adequate.  Quite a lot of tools allow you to estimate how much time is spent on a particular type of task.  If you use these tools in each project of your company, then in a short period of time you will be able to fairly accurately assume how long this or that task will take.  Arrange the proposed stages in the project schedule and write them down!  Upon completion and recording of each stage, you will have a clear picture of how your project in development corresponds to the business goals. <br><br>  Firmly following these 5 principles will lead you to 8% of the elite.  You will not be able to portray them: set standards, look for tools and make everyone on your team follow them.  Simply proclaiming these principles will not lead your project to a group of rare successful projects.  You have to make them part of your daily life and introduce them in the team and among other managers, and then you can watch with a smirk how you don‚Äôt break deadlines. <br><br>  For ten years of working with the world's largest companies, we have achieved a 40% reduction in costs in our projects, using these 5 principles.  <i>Further pure advertising, but I will translate it too.</i>  Want to know more - come to our website <a href="http://www.elementool.com/">www.elementool.com</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/90982/">https://habr.com/ru/post/90982/</a></p>
