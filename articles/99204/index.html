Since the end of 2009, many people believe that Google Chrome OS is positioned as a system that will replace Microsoft Windows.  I think they do not know what they are saying. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  As recognized by Google itself, Chrome OS is designed exclusively for use on netbooks - from the pursuit of minimalism.  And, as we know, netbooks make up only a small part of the personal computer market.  This clearly indicates that Google does not pretend to laptops and desktops where Windows currently reigns (at least in the short term). <br><br>  This makes us think that Google does not intend to qualify for Microsoft‚Äôs Windows market.  So maybe Chrome OS is aimed at something that is more similar in design to it?  For example, on Ubuntu Linux?

      Or perhaps there is another alternative goal for Google that has so far remained in the shadows? <br><br>  In this article I will consider all of these opportunities, plus I will share some thoughts about how I imagine the further development of Chrome OS.  I‚Äôll guess what role Ubuntu, Windows and even Mac OS X can play in Google‚Äôs long-term plans. <br><br><h4>  Is Chrome OS Linux or Not? </h4><br>  In order to make any correlations between Ubuntu and Chrome OS, we need to find out what Linux and Chrome OS have in common.  Chrome OS is really based on the Linux kernel.  In addition, the Chrome OS project benefits a lot from code provided by Moblin and Ubuntu. <br><br>  Given that Linux is basically a kernel, it's safe to say that Chrome OS is really based on Linux. <br><br>  The difference between them lies in the fact that the latter is already available for testing by developers who own already known code - if only they are willing to take the risk. <br><br>  In short, they are essentially the same. <br><br><h4>  Chrome OS does not compete with Windows </h4><br>  Google is not trying to compete with Windows and Ubuntu.  For Google, the operating system is just a means to an end. <br><br>  Unlike Microsoft, which is struggling to maintain dominance on the desktop, Google is satisfied with the current state of affairs.  While the Redmond giant is battling with competitors, Google is committed to what it can do best - advertising and web services on all platforms. <br><br>  While Microsoft is trying to keep market share for its operating system and other software, Google is increasing its presence on all platforms where possible.  This work, of course, includes the development of its own Chrome OS - in addition to Windows, OS X and various Linux distributions. <br><br>  But perhaps the most important difference between Chrome OS from Ubuntu or even Windows with regard to its support is that you cannot install this system by yourself.  According to my information, you can get it only pre-installed. <br><br><h4>  Can Chrome OS be a boon for other Linux distributions? </h4><br>  I believe that Chrome OS will have a beneficial effect on other distributions due to the likely transfer of code.  At first glance, Google will make people think about alternative operating systems, but on the second, it‚Äôs just an accident and a gift for those who are eager for Linux to win over Windows. <br><br>  And yet, I think that Google uses Linux code to create Chrome, and then create a tool that will bring this victory closer: Google Chrome Webstore for desktop computers. <br><br>  It might look like this.  The app, which is in demand and popular with Android OS users, can repeat its success in a similar market for Chrome apps.  The difference is that instead of an exclusively ‚Äúmobile‚Äù application, we will see a desktop application. <br><br>  Even better, web apps that are purchased by Google Chrome Webstore will run on any customer‚Äôs operating system. <br><br>  So if you consider that Google is striving with its Chrome OS to the netbook market, then firstly, it helps the company to increase its own market share, and at the same time reduces the damage in case of a potential failure.  Very good: in case of success, the company gets the laurels of the winner, in the event of a possible defeat, it distances itself from the losers.  (Note that it is Google that controls the manufacturers - who is allowed to access their operating system, and who is not). <br><br><h4>  Chrome OS and Android, which of them is not needed? </h4><br>  So far, we have considered the situation from the point of view that Chrome OS was not created to compete with any of the existing operating systems.  On the contrary, I pointed out that, like in most Google projects, there is something more hidden here. <br><br>  However, the question arises: why do you need Chrome OS, if at present the operating system from Google is already available, which works fine on mobile devices and netbooks - that is, Android? <br><br>  So why bother with Chrome OS if there is no intention to compete with Windows and the rest? <br><br>  But for what: <br><br>  1. The Android system is truncated compared to the desktop operating system.  The proposed operating system for the workstation will increase market share for both Google and those who sell software for it. <br><br>  2. Chrome OS is a polygon, completely isolated from Android, Ubuntu Linux, Windows and so on.  In the event of a failure in the desktop market, Google will be able to save face, explaining that it was just a beta experiment. <br><br><h4>  Finally </h4><br>  As far as I understand, Ubuntu and Chrome OS have two completely different fates, and they don‚Äôt duplicate each other. <br><br>  I‚Äôm sure Chrome OS is the only way to access Google services. <br><br>  I‚Äôm also confident that Chrome OS is only a means to deliver Google services and help promote other Webstore apps. <br><br>  Therefore, I see no threat to Ubuntu from Chrome OS.  Google has no reason to start promoting its system beyond the tightly controlled netbook market. <br><br>  One warning: if Google offers its online store based on web applications without sufficient testing - it will be a bad move.  So ensuring the testing of these applications on the Chrome OS platform looks absolutely necessary.  And if this initiative is successful, I foresee that in the end, a similar online store will offer applications for operating systems such as Windows, and in the end (oh, yes!) For Linux distributions, such as Ubuntu. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/99204/">https://habr.com/ru/post/99204/</a></p>
