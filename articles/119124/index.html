  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Rumors about WinC ++</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  On the Internet there are vague rumors about a certain WinC ++.  Toli is just a new name for Visual C ++, toli is something more.  Since I am interested and concerned about the subject of Visual C ++, I paid attention to this topic.  I came across a recent article from May 4, "What is WinC ++?".  Since the Russian language is still quiet about WinC ++, I decided to offer the Habra-community a translation of this article.  I admit, the translation was not very, read boring.  Therefore, many probably prefer to get acquainted with the <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/blog/microsoft/what-is-winc-and-how-does-it-figure-in-microsofts-bid-to-make-tools-a-2-billion-business/9359">original</a> . <br><br>  I ask for this article not to complain, as they say the first pancake is lumpy.  The useful and most important thing in this article is, perhaps, that Microsoft is clearly not planning to bury Visual C ++, but rather to infuse new forces in this direction.  C ++ is viewed as a living and developing tool.  It pleases (me, at least :)). <br><br>  So, the actual translation of the article by Mary-Joe Folly: What is WinC ++ and how does it relate to the desire of Microsoft to increase sales of tools to 2 billion dollars?

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h2>  annotation </h2><br>  Microsoft is strengthening its C ++ products and marketing strategy for the upcoming release of WinC ++.  Here are some scattered information that I managed to unearth about this. <br><br>  Now that the dust raised this week by the <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/blog/microsoft/microsofts-plan-to-increase-its-focus-on-developers-the-full-internal-memo/9327">reorganization of the server and tool development department</a> inside Microsoft, has begun to settle, it's time to move from the question ‚ÄúWho?‚Äù To the questions ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù And ‚ÄúHow?‚Äù. <br><br>  Why did Microsoft's bosses decide to transfer development and evangelism groups to the office of the head of the Somasegar development team? <br><br>  "At Microsoft, there is a huge problem with compliance among developers," said one of my acquaintances, who knows the corporation's concerns.  <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/blog/btl/hps-cloud-coming-into-focus-via-linkedin-profile/48206">The information on the public cloud programming strategy that Hewlett-Packard has just leaked out</a> (which focuses on Java, Ruby and "open source languages") just confirms this thesis.  While the C #, C ++ and Visual Basic languages ‚Äã‚Äãstill have their followers, such non-Microsoft languages ‚Äã‚Äãlike <a href="http://www.tiobe.com/index.php/content/paperinfo/tpci/index.html">Java, Ruby, Python, PHP and Objective-C confidently hold their positions</a> and develop as quickly, if not faster. <br><br>  As can be seen from <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/blog/microsoft/microsofts-plan-to-increase-its-focus-on-developers-the-full-internal-memo/9327">Somasegar</a> 's <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/blog/microsoft/microsofts-plan-to-increase-its-focus-on-developers-the-full-internal-memo/9327">e-mail to the STB division on reorganization</a> , the company is making some efforts to increase the sales turnover of Visual Studio from the current mark of more than $ 1 billion to $ 2 billion.  (Visual Studio is one of the few products besides Windows and Office that have <a href="http://redmondmag.com/articles/2010/09/01/what-is-microsofts-next-billion-dollar-business.aspx">already crossed $ 1 billion in sales</a> .) <br><br>  How is Microsoft going to raise revenue, regardless of its well-established development team? <br><br>  One of the ways, I think, is to strengthen the position of "native" tools for developers, such as Visual C ++.  I noticed that WinC ++ was casually mentioned in an email from Somasegar.  It turns out that <a href="http://www.microsoft-careers.com/job/Redmond-Software-Development-Engineer-in-Test-ll-Job-WA-98052/1161369/">WinC ++ will become a new name for Visual C ++</a> - this idea is confirmed by the fact that in one of the job advertisements at Microsoft there is a clarification: ‚ÄúThe Windows C ++ team, also known as the Visual C ++ team.‚Äù <br><br>  It became interesting to me: is it possible that WinC ++ is nothing more than just the new (and obviously ‚Äúhoned‚Äù under the Windows brand) name of the old compiler? <br><br>  From another job ad at Microsoft, I concluded that the company was indeed promoting the idea that C ++ would be the key to building applications for the upcoming version of Windows.  Here is an excerpt from that admission for the position of Team Leader for WinC ++ Projects: <br><br>  <i>‚ÄúImpressed with the new features of the applications that open the Windows platform?</i>  <i>Want to collaborate and inspire C ++ developers around the world to create innovative, unique Windows-based solutions? ‚Äù</i> <br><br>  (Such a focus on Windows reminds me of the work of the Internet Explorer development team, who also increasingly talk about how <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/blog/microsoft/microsoft-plays-up-internet-explorer-9-ties-to-windows-at-browser-launch/8921">much better / faster IE 9 is due to optimization under Windows 7</a> , and so on. I think the group will pursue the same policy and for IE 10, pointing to its <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/04/13/web_skewers_microsoft_for_native_html5_talk/">‚Äúnow improved native HTML support‚Äù in the messaging engine</a> , thereby referring to Windows 8 ‚Äî the most suitable browser platform.) <br><br>  The next question is: will Microsoft have plans to do something more than just rename its C ++ product and still implement the new C ++ functionality in the next version of Visual Studio, which is expected to be called Visual Studio 2012?  Seems Yes. <br><br>  Here is an excerpt from another Microsoft job ad, where WinC ++ is mentioned: <br><br>  <i>‚ÄúWant to help developers create C ++ applications for the next version of Windows?</i>  <i>Do you want to study in detail the new version of COM (Component Object Model, the model of composite objects) and create content that can boast of its capabilities?</i>  <i>Want to write about new programming models for the next version of Windows? "...</i> <br><br>  <i>‚ÄúThe development team is actively investing in the innovations of the C ++ language and the development of‚Äú native ‚Äùcode, aiming at creating large-scale and complex projects.</i>  <i>She also works on technologies that would help C ++ developers use a rich development environment, making the IDE (Integrated Development Environment) scalable over a wider range, more user-friendly and, most importantly, able to quickly adapt to the needs of modern C ++ developers. .</i>  <i>These investments will directly affect almost all Microsoft software products, as well as products of many top independent vendors.</i>  <i>We are starting to develop a number of very ambitious and effective solutions on several fronts, including in the field of innovations in languages ‚Äã‚Äãand code generation. ‚Äù</i> <br><br>  Another <a href="http://www.microsoft-careers.com/job/Redmond-Program-Writer-Senior-Job-WA-98052/1229592/">Microsoft job ad for WinC ++</a> mentions ‚Äúnew C ++ and COM technologies that come with Visual Studio, as well as a description of updates to existing C ++ libraries, such as Standard Template Library. " <br><br>  Here are some more comments, possibly related to our topic: <br><ul><li>  A team of Chanel9, covering the activities of Microsoft, <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/Going%2BDeep/Conversation-with-Herb-Sutter-Perspectives-on-Modern-C0x11">recently posted a new content about C ++</a> . </li><li>  As part of the reorganization of the server and instrumental department, Microsoft transferred the parallel programming and instrumental development team (headed by Steve Teixeira, <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/exec/de/Callahan/default.mspx">David Callahan</a> and Sharoh Mortazawi) to ‚ÄúWinC ++, PCP (possibly parallel and / or high-performance programming?) And UX under the leadership of Mohsen (Agsen). " <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/exec/techfellow/Agsen/default.mspx">Agsen holds the position of technical leader</a> , currently working in the developer department, and at one time played a very important role in creating the COM + and Common La technologies  nguage runtime (common language executable environment).  ( <a href="http://www.google.de/search%3Fsourceid%3Dchrome%26amp%3Bie%3DUTF-8%26amp%3Bq%3Dchannel%2B9%2Bmoshen%2Bagsen">In an interview with Channel9 in February 2011, he talked about C ++ Revival</a> .) </li><li>  It seems that the <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/blog/microsoft/more-on-microsoft-jupiter-and-what-it-means-for-windows-8/8373">Microsoft Jupiter Development Environment for Windows 8</a> , which I wrote about in a blog some time ago this year, is somehow related to the ‚ÄúXAML plus native code‚Äù approach.  C ++ may have been one of those languages ‚Äã‚Äãwhose support was planned in Jupiter. </li><li>  Maybe there is also some connection with <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/blog/microsoft/microsoft-delivers-its-other-tablet-operating-system-windows-embedded-compact-7/8807">Windows Embedded Compact 7</a> (and all mobile phones and tablets that run on this platform), given the presence of C ++ / XAML support in this operating system. </li></ul><br>  I‚Äôm wondering if you, the developers reading this post, have any thoughts, guesses or wishlists that you would like to share with me and that could shed light on what Microsoft is doing there?  What do you think about all this chatter about WinC ++?  What else would you like to see in Visual Studio 2012? <br><br><h2>  about the author </h2><br>  Mary Jo has been writing articles in the computer industry for over 25 years in various publications and websites, and is also a frequent guest on radio, television and podcasts, where she discusses any issues related to Microsoft.
