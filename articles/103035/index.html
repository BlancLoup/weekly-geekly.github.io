  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The future of online film distribution</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/youtubecom/103013/">next topic</a> discussing the topic of paid movies on Youtube.  The idea is, in principle, a promising one - especially if you offer a travel agent not as a competitor to torrents, but to traditional film distribution.  This topic is not re-sucking the same news, but thoughts about the future of such services. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/97e/25b/ffe/97e25bffeb429603451ea2cef575e84e.jpg" width="460" height="276" alt="29.24 KB"><br><br>  Judge for yourself - in torrents movies appear in good quality only after the DVD is released - that is, at that stage when the movie from the category ‚Äúwant to see - pay‚Äù already goes into the category ‚Äúlook beyond that‚Äù - and it‚Äôs not just the development of file sharing services like as if the ‚Äútake a cassette / disk‚Äù phenomenon had never been seen before.  In such a simple way, the content of the right holders, albeit at a slower rate, still diverged from one‚Äôs hands.

      But consumers who would like to watch a movie as soon as it goes into rent, while they have no choice - you need to go to the cinema, with no options. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  I‚Äôll say right away that I‚Äôm skipping a large audience of VKontakte, staring up to the holes of a screen with a picture of 400-500 pixels stretched to full screen with resolution of 400-500 pixels, first of all, because we are crying rogue bastards, but people are totally insensitive to the quality of the picture - which means, in general, and to the cinema itself - not quite the target audience of the distributors.  Secondly, what is probably more important - for many people, ‚Äúzazyr‚Äù on Vkontakte is a kind of tasting, the results of which make the decision to go or not to go to the cinema (wait or not wait for the DVD-rip network :). <br><br>  So, we know that we want to watch a particular film - or, okay, we watched a piece in Vkontakte and realized that yes - we want it, and what are our options?  In addition to going to the cinema, you now have the option of watching on Youtube.  The advantages are obvious - cheaper (in Moscow, for 5 bucks, you can go to the cinema only in the morning, and the associated expenses - even if not popcorn, and although time and travel expenses, if the cinema is not near, this pleasure is more expensive).  Comfortable - not everyone likes to watch a movie in the company of strangers.  Faster - they opened the browser, chose the quality - and we look. <br><br>  I don‚Äôt even talk about Youtube now, online film distribution technologies really have a great future as a competitor to traditional rentals.  No, he will not kill piracy - on the contrary, HD rips on the network will appear even faster.  But it will reduce the loss of profit, which is most killed kopirasty - just due to the <s>seduction of</s> attracting those who do not go to the movies for the above reasons - expensive, once, uncomfortable. <br><br>  The second point that makes online movie rental so spectacular lies in the business plane.  Cinema is a business, and the technology that allows you to earn more will win.  Online film rentals will allow Hollywood bosses to get at least at least one viewer than at the cinema - the cheapness of the ‚Äúticket‚Äù on Youtube is compensated by not needing to give half of the income to the cinema (really, the film pays off, you need to collect at least two of its budgets with taking into account the shares of all participants in the film distribution process).  Of course, Youtube (or future similar services) will also take a percentage - but incomparably smaller, at the expense of lower costs.  For YouTube, this is generally the most likely way to increase the return on infrastructure costs already made. <br><br>  But there are nuances that are still to be learned on this path.  For example, I am convinced that the ‚Äú5 bucks - one view‚Äù scheme cannot fully realize the advantages described above ‚Äî rather, it will only increase the number of leaking viewers who will watch pirated HD rips from the same YouTube and stuffed ones.  There are two reasons for this - firstly, psychological - when we deal with content on our computer, we are accustomed to the fact that we can dispose of it fully - not only to pause, but also to return to it later, for example, to review the film or some parts of it later.  If YouTube will demand from the user, for example, after restarting the browser to pay again - this will be a strong annoying factor. <br><br>  Secondly, Youtube is still not a cinema, where people pay money not so much for watching a movie as such, but for spending time.  An online cinema is still a more utilitarian thing, you don‚Äôt invite a girl to an online cinema (wrote and wondered why not? At least, this can significantly speed up the development of events for which girls are usually invited to the cinema. So You can not watch a movie on the sofa something :).  No, of course there will be any services that line up their culture around online cinema - chat rooms are some integrable, buttons like ‚Äúturn on the chewing neighbor's popcorn‚Äù, but cinemas will not die out - just like ordinary theaters, paper books, etc. <br><br>  Going to the cinema on Youtube is more likely an analogue of buying a disc than going to the cinema of a traditional one.  And here it is important that the purchased content was delivered to the buyer entirely, with the right of disposal: he wanted - revised, an unlimited number of times.  Yes, such shows will be led by friends, etc.  - but with the usual drives the same story. <br><br>  In the comments to the required <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/youtubecom/103013/">news about the restart of paid online cinema,</a> they wrote about monthly subscriptions, annual subscriptions, etc.  - but this is hardly possible, at least with the premieres - the film product is expensive and budgets are only growing.  For movies that have already been released in circulation - from six months to a year and older, this is certainly possible, but online rentals will still remain a piece of service - you can only dream of such a degree of cooperativity when the largest Hollywood studios agreed to pack sale.  Yes, and the distribution of profits in such a scheme is not clear.  Therefore, online or offline screening, but a movie ticket will remain a ticket for one movie :) <br><br>  What other changes are possible?  It is clear that in the calculations of film fees will begin to take into account revenues from online rentals.  But because of the lower price of the ‚Äúticket‚Äù, the total amounts will not look so impressive already - so the traditional Internet calculation of views and viewers will become more important. <br><br>  Obviously, the future of online cinema.  The question is only in the timing of its occurrence.  The fact that Google took over the business, and Youtube will be a platform for film viewing inspires a certain optimism. <br><br>  PS Picture taken <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2009/jul/08/digital-cinema">from here</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/103035/">https://habr.com/ru/post/103035/</a></p>
