Joke"><br>  This post is written in the footsteps of posts. <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/152995/">What you need to do in your youth or how to become a rich IT person</a> and <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/153233/">How to become a rich IT person is a continuation from another author</a> . <br>  Do not think that I am going to teach you how to become rich.  I will simply tell one story related to the ideas that the authors expressed in these posts, and you will draw your own conclusions.  If you are too lazy to read, you can see the meaning of my entire story in the figure above. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  Story </h5><br>  It was a long time ago.  I was still young and then I had a lot of free time.  To improve my knowledge of English and gain useful knowledge at the same time, I read the book by Robert Toru Kiyosaki ‚ÄúRich Dad, Poor Dad‚Äù (Rich Dad, Poor Dad) in English.  The book was remarkably written in simple language and I had no problems reading it in English.  In addition, the book was quite interesting - it contained many life examples of working with capital.  In the west at the time she was a great success. <br>  After a couple of years, my brother got me this book in Russian.  The translation of the book exceeded all my expectations.  The translation turned out to be so well built and simple that its reading did not cause any complaints.  If it were not for one thing ... The meaning of the book was distorted beyond recognition.  From an excellent book with good ideas in English, the translator made an excellent book with authentic nonsense in Russian.  Moreover, the translation was made so well that if you read only the Russian version, then willy-nilly, you begin to believe in this nonsense. <br><br>  And then this book, you ask?  The fact is that the above posts describe the ideas of this book, or rather the translation. <br><br><h5>  Translation error </h5><br>  The whole idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthis book comes down to proper asset management.  In the English version of the book, the word ‚Äúassets‚Äù is used everywhere, which has a specific meaning - assets, i.e.  capital and funds that can be used.  For reasons unknown to science, with the light hand of the translator, ‚Äúasset‚Äù turned into ‚Äúactive‚Äù (either PROMT was used, or the translator was just an idiot, or maybe both).  The word "active" has a number of meanings, such as "active", "live" and "asset balance."  You do not need to have high intelligence to understand that these are completely different concepts.  A little later in the book there is such a thing as ‚Äúliabilities‚Äù - a debt.  The translator ‚Äúliabilities‚Äù turned into a ‚Äúpassive‚Äù, which was associated not only with the concepts of debt and payments, but the concept of ‚Äúpassive balance.‚Äù

      As you might have guessed, the book translated into Russian had a different meaning.  Of course, the meaning was not completely lost, but was grossly distorted. <br><br><h5>  What is the difference between the English version of the Russian? </h5><br>  I will not go through the entire book, since I read it for a very long time, I‚Äôll focus on two main mistakes in the Russian version. <br><br>  The first mistake: <i>"Asset - this is what brings income</i> . <i>"</i>  Actually (in the English version), we are talking about assets, i.e.  capital and property, even if they do not generate income.  Kiyosaki called for accumulating any assets, since they can be made to generate income. <br><br>  Error two: <i>‚ÄúThere are assets and liabilities.</i>  <i>What makes a profit is an asset.</i>  <i>What causes waste is a passive</i> . <i>‚Äù</i>  In fact, the ‚Äúliabilities‚Äù (‚Äúdebt‚Äù) are the costs of maintaining assets.  That is, the "liability" is inseparable from the assets, as well as any asset has its "liability".  Kiyosaki called for a reduction in costs (‚Äúliabilities‚Äù) for the maintenance of assets.  The translation has lost its meaning due to the fact that in the Russian language "asset" and "liability" are alternative concepts, and in English "assets" and "liabilities" - related. <br><br>  Thanks to these mistakes in translation, from a book on how to manage capital, we got a book about how to chase sources of income and be afraid of any costs. <br><br><h5>  Afterword </h5><br>  If you catch the difference between English and Russian presentation of the book, then try to read again the posts listed at the beginning of the topic ( <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/152995/">once</a> and <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/153233/">twice</a> ).  I think you will have a completely different look at the mortgage apartment, the family, the sword from the game and the house in the mountains. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/153245/">https://habr.com/ru/post/153245/</a></p>
