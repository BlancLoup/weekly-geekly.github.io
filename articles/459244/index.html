  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Product manager notes: user behavior on game pages in the app store. How much time is needed to download the game</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  There is a large amount of information on the Internet on how to publish mobile games correctly, how to do marketing for them, what to place on store pages, but a large number of nuances are not immediately apparent.  In this article, I will share my notes and insights, which were derived from the results of advertising experiments.  In particular, about the behavior of users on the pages of mobile games in the app store.  I really hope that the notes will help the young developers avoid stepping on the rake by investing money and time in filling the pages of games in the store. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The conditions of our experiments: <br><ol><li>  pages of stores with casual games / puzzles of different styles without a clear focus on a certain gender or age, </li><li>  audience - 300k users from the USA, </li><li>  all users hit the store pages from advertising on Facebook and Instagram, </li><li>  focus on interested in mobile games. </li></ol><br><br>  Notes and conclusions: <br><ul><li>  50% of users over the age of 50 (despite the fact that we are talking about games - it is necessary to take into account the interests of the adult generation very strongly, as half of them); </li><li>  65% of female users (2 out of 3 potential users of your game are female audience, do not forget to focus on them); </li><li>  25% of users browse the game page in the store to the bottom line (not everyone is interested in what account you have, build, who is the developer, what size of the application); </li><li>  70% of users view all screenshots of the application (the most important tool on the page, almost all users view the first screenshot and about 70% inspect to the last (with 3-4 screenshots per game)); </li><li>  &lt;1 second, users spend on viewing one screenshot of an application (Put the brightest and most memorable screenshots, less than 1 second is to lure a potential user into the application on 1 screenshot); </li><li>  5% of users watch screenshots in full screen mode.  (Do not focus attention on small elements in the screenshots, very few people will see them in full-size mode); </li><li>  7% of users click on the ‚Äúmore‚Äù button to reveal a detailed description of the application (people are lazy, they do not want to read a lot of text about your game, to decide whether they want to download the game or not they just have to look at the screenshots, don‚Äôt waste time on writing memoirs about your game - most likely they won't read it); </li><li>  6 seconds are enough for users to understand that the game is not interesting for them and they don‚Äôt want to download it (Just 6 seconds is enough for the user to understand that the store‚Äôs page is not what he expected to see when clicking on an advertisement and leave the store Ie. You only have 6 seconds to convince the user to download your game); </li><li>  9 seconds, users need to understand that they want to download the game (3 seconds are spent reading the name and capturing information at the top of the store; about 3 seconds to view screenshots of the game; and another 3 seconds to ‚Äúthink‚Äù and click on the download button) ; </li><li>  40% of users download the application after switching from an advertisement, provided that what was shown in the advertisement corresponds to what is indicated on the store page. </li></ul>

      Of course, some moments can be very subjective and differ from application to application, but for most applications that are suitable for our conditions, most likely they will be + - the same.  If someone conducted similar research or its data is different - write in the comments. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/459244/">https://habr.com/ru/post/459244/</a></p>
