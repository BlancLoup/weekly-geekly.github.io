  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Tap dance in flippers</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><h5>  Super entry </h5><br>  Hello% username%.  We are such a wonderful company, la-la, positions in the market, bla-bla-based, best practice, familiarized on our website ... in general, we will consider this game of bulshit-bingo finished :) Let's get down to business.  I will tell you about how bad things are. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Here you read TechCrunch.  You go to the main page, right on <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/">www.techcrunch.com</a> and read directly with your eyes: A startup has collected ten million dollars.  A start-up got a second round of funding in the amount - and you have a finger on the screen: ‚ÄúLope over there zeros?  How many!!!?".  There is even some kind of feeling of your own insignificance.  It is treated simply.  You open the same TechCrunch, but two years ago.  Here, for example, grou.ps is a start-up, having received a <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2008/06/29/groups-pulls-in-11-million-opens-up-code-to-take-on-ning/">million bucks a</a> year ago.  Well, where are they today?  In the same place, where this million, in a rhyme.  <a href="">Look</a> at Alex <a href="">yourself</a> .  Who is guilty?  Well, ordinary employees have no shame.  They are on salary.  But the leadership, the one who gave them the money - they also dreamed, wanted, sought.  Guided by people leading them to success.  And doodovodilis up to the above rhyme. <br>  Well this is only in press releases, the management looks like one hundred percent competent people.  But life is not like that.  In life, you sometimes deal with people like me *.  I manage a technology company, a start-up if you like, but at the same time I do not understand anything about what I am doing.  My acquaintance with programming ended at the undergraduate courses of the University.  I need help connecting the printer.  And getting into the registry to remove these arrows in the corner from the desktop shortcuts is not available to me as a class. <br>  My incompetent leadership leads to a huge number of errors.  About them I also will tell.  And immediately about how to live with it all.  Some <a href="http://www.xmlshop.com/RU/statistic.html">results</a> we still achieved.  But you should know how much we lost.  And how many lost.  This is some kind of horror. <br><br><h5>  Verbose Mystery </h5><br>  In general, in general, there are four types of errors: <br>  1. With people, when the wrong person does the important part.  For example, you hired a designer, he draws beautifully, but he does not know how to interface.  And your project is highly dependent on interfaces.  Well, that's it. <br>  2. With the process, when in general, the administrative part of the Koryava.  Say you have often rotated sellers, but kicks, in order to force them to enter the data in CRM, they hang out with insufficient force.  As a result, they skimp on this work.  And your service is complicated and to sell it, you need to communicate with the client many times.  Here you are in problems, like a fish in scales. <br>  3. With technology.  That made themselves a site application developers on ipad generously using flash.  And it is not visible on AyPadakh.  Theoretically, everything could be good, but almost a potential client most often thinks that he needs an iPad application just at the moment when he takes his iPad.  He is looking for a performer.  And the feeder drives past you.  It's a shame. <br>  4. With laziness.  Almost everyone probably remembers the moments when something needs to be done, but right now, well, reluctance.  Well, quite reluctant.  And tomorrow is too lazy.  And the day after tomorrow.  And in general, can it somehow resolve itself?  In fairness, I must say that sometimes the truth is resolved.  But more often not.

      This classification is very conditional.  Real life usually prepares cocktails by carefully mixing all the ingredients.  The wrong person is a little lazy to think, makes the wrong moves in technology, and all this because his place in the administrative process is in the shadow and invisible to the authorities.  Here, for example, why is our engine written in PHP?  Because the wrong boss (s), who does not have sufficient technical competence, agreed with the first proposal that came up, because it was too lazy to try to figure it out, and there was no one to kick me administratively.  That is, the choice of PHP was just an accident.  And thus 90% of all questions are solved.  Sometimes even guess. <br><br><h5>  Looking from the outside, or why are they all such freaks? </h5><br>  Good specialists are generally hard.  Morally difficult in this world of amateurs.  Here you understand, for example, in database design.  They began to work with us, looked and were horrified - what a mess we have there.  Come out to the smoking room, and there to meet you is the same wonderful specialist in the layout.  He has a similar problem in the diocese.  We discussed with him what are all the idiots before you play tricks and returned to workplaces.  Here, your colleague had to fix something not just in the layout, but already in the design.  But in design it is not so cool at all.  Four component error cocktail is served.  The layout has become better, the design has become worse.  A good designer is looking at it tomorrow from the side - what a mess you have there.  That's how we live.  At any time in our office there is some wild amount of some unreal idiocy.  Tail taken out, nose stuck.  Nose taken out, tail stuck.  From the side look, laughter and only. <br><br><h5>  How do we live with all this? </h5><br>  As in a joke. <br>  Once the Chukchi went with a geologist to go hunting in the winter, the cartridges spent everything, and on the way back they accidentally fell into a den.  Well, while the bear came to himself there, they managed to jump out and escape.  At some distance ran away, and then the bear got out.  Angry, hungry, well, for them.  Geologist on the run with the Chukchi talking: <br>  G - it is useless.  We can't run faster than a bear. <br>  W - but I do not need to run faster than a bear.  I have to run faster than you. <br><br>  All the same.  Competitors, both direct and indirect, live in exactly the same conditions.  We sometimes look at them in saucepans: well, dear mother, what kind of idiocy are they doing sometimes.  And we stand, we stir our brew rather in our kitchen.  Then you will step aside, put the author's pride on the shelf, look at the affairs of your hands and think: the arms are growing from the shoulders, not from the pelvis.  What is it with my anatomy? <br>  Insanity in your office will still be.  And in great quantities.  In general, the trick is that your level of marasmus was not the average 90%, but only 85. And now you are already running faster than a geologist.  And we and you are not perfect.  We dance our tap dance in boots and it turns out awful.  But what kind of progress is this compared to taped flippers? <br><br>  * and that you are lucky.  You may get caught by an equally incompetent boss, only a poor one. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/111700/">https://habr.com/ru/post/111700/</a></p>
