  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Ten Apple iPhone Myths</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Columnist Daniel Eran of <a href="http://www.roughlydrafted.com/">RoughlyDrafted Magazine</a> decided to prove the failure of ten popular iPhone myths.  From high prices to the harmful effects of the Cingular monopoly, from possible scratches to the lack of important functions.  For every cry of skeptics, Daniel tried to find a worthy answer. <a name="habracut"></a><br>  Daniel Eran, expert, journalist and traveler <br><br>  <b>1. The lack of EVDO and other high-end features can reduce the popularity of the iPhone.</b>  According to Eran, all these high-end capabilities only increase the price with a slight increase in benefits.  Apple has made the right choice, not to equip your smartphone with a bunch of rare and under-used functions.  This is the only way to create a popular and affordable product for the masses. <br><br>  <b>2. The price of the iPhone is too high.</b>  <b>Now, if Apple released a version with 2GB, and without telephone functions, the price could be dropped to $ 299.</b>  Another heresy, according to Daniel.  Apple's smartphone fits perfectly into the price range provided by the company.  And this range is higher than the prices on the most advanced iPod 5G model - just as much as the iPod 5G itself is more expensive than the iPod nano.  A cheap $ 299 iPhone would create extra competition and damage iPods.

      <b>3. iPhone should be sold freely, without reference to the operator Cingular.</b>  In response, it should be pointed out that it was an exclusive contract with Cingular that allowed achieving an acceptable price for the iPhone. <br><br>  <b>4. Software for iPhone is closed from outside developers, they can not write programs for the phone.</b>  This reason was caused by Apple‚Äôs desire to protect the operator‚Äôs network and the user from unstable and poor-quality programs that could cause data freeze or leak.  Closed development model is the key to better programs. <br><br>  <b>5. The iPhone is just a smartphone with features already on the market.</b>  It should be remembered that in fact the iPhone's touchscreen is unique - it allows you to recognize gestures and touches with a few fingers, which no smartphone or PDA can do today.  Among the unique features can also be noted visual voicemail, full browser and powerful operating system Mac OS X. <br><br>  <b>6. The name of the iPhone belongs to Cisco.</b>  But, first, at the time of release, Apple may call your phone differently.  Though Apple Phone, at least somehow.  Second, despite Cisco‚Äôs announcement, its products still belong to a different niche than Apple‚Äôs iPhone.  And thirdly, the name of the iPhone is now strongly associated with Apple - and this despite the fact that the rights to this brand belong to Cisco for almost seven years! <br><br>  <b>7. Apple should port iLife 07 to Windows so that PC users also get a photo viewer.</b>  This offer is absurd, since there are enough such programs on the PC without Apple.  You can view photos from iPhone in any convenient editor or browser. <br><br>  <b>8. Built-in battery is a problem.</b>  Complaints that the built-in battery does not allow the use of an additional charge in the form of a replaceable battery do not have a special meaning.  Apple has a wealth of experience using embedded iPod batteries.  70 million buyers who purchased the player, proved that the built-in battery is not a problem. <br><br>  <b>9. Scratches!</b>  With regard to possible scratches on the iPhone screen, Daniel notices that Apple has certainly taken care of the protective layer (as on the Sony PSP console).  In addition, the number of scratches directly depends on the user.  Be careful, use screen protectors - and there will be no scratches. <br><br>  <b>10. Apple does not understand how to make phones.</b>  This phrase can be heard from the mouth of both Michael Kanellos, editor of CNET, and President Palm Ed Colligan.  But in fact, writes Daniel, Apple knows how to make phones.  Moreover, the iPhone has just proved that traditional handset manufacturers do not know how to do it themselves. <br><br>  Translation: <a href="http://www.maccentre.ru/news/25131">Mac Center</a> <br>  Original: <a href="http://www.roughlydrafted.com/RD/RDM.Tech.Q1.07/4DD0941D-9097-4FAE-A3BB-29DA5CA07199.html">RoughlyDrafted Magazine</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/1147/">https://habr.com/ru/post/1147/</a></p>
