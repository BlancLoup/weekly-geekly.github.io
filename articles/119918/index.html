Startups and US Investments</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  TechCrunch Disrupt is a conference in New York.  A small report on the immersion in the environment of startups in the US, where <a href="http://ibearsoft.com/">we are</a> now. <br><br><img src="http://disrupt.techcrunch.com/wp-content/themes/tcdisrupt/styles/tc_green/logo.png" alt="image"><br><br>  I think the majority of readers either nurture their idea, or are already working on their business project.  I am the founder of a startup and came to New York with a colleague to learn wisely from American startups.  When you read about everything on the Internet, the idea is completely different.  It was interesting to compare the event with Russian TechCrunch, which took place at the end of 2010 in Moscow, and with StartupPoint.  I do not pretend to be complete.  Here you can find the full translation in English from the organizer.  I will explain my impressions of being here. <br><a name="habracut"></a>

      <b>Hackathon</b> <br><br>  So.  It all began on May 21st from a twenty-four-hour marathon to develop a new product (Hackathon).  500 developers (most by teams) had to implement the project in a day and then present it to the public.  Beginning at 12 noon and completion the next morning.  All who came to the end and presented the project received a free ticket to the conference (a ticket for startups $ 1,000 per person). <br><br>  Most of the time, we developed the idea and understood the various APIs, so we did not have time to release the work product to the end.  Every 4 hours there was a feature cut, but the project was presented.  They broke the applause in words that came from Siberia.  I can‚Äôt name any memorable projects developed in a day.  Although not.  There was one game Venture Crapital, a parody of the situation with an overestimation of the value of companies.  Some of the projects were clearly ‚Äúrefined‚Äù, and not ‚Äúdeveloped‚Äù over the course of that day.  A large number of projects related to check-in, badges, using Twitter, Foursquare, Facebook API's.  Of the visiting colleagues was a comrade from Tokyo.  Strictly and point by point he told about his project and bowed politely to everyone. <br><br>  It was interesting to look at the developers (or hackers, as they are called here).  Someone kodil and did not say anything, someone had a lively discussion about something in the team.  At one o'clock at the hour someone shouted ‚ÄúYeah!‚Äù And everyone clapped.  By evening, they began to bring beer and pizza, at night they ate food from a Chinese restaurant. <br><br>  I was a little shocked to see a policeman in the toilet, who looked like a Simson hero who was standing near his urinal and sipped from a cup of coffee at the same time. <br><br>  After the event, I felt that I was plowed.  I wanted to use a different wording here ... <br><br>  Then we went to the Pirates of the Caribbean 4 in the center of New York.  Despite the excellent 3D cinema, excellent jokes in the original and the unparalleled game of Johnny Depp, I still snored in the second part of the film. <br><br>  Hotels in New York are very expensive and for $ 50 per person, you get a terrible closet, but in the center of Manhattan.  After Hackathon it was not important. <br><br>  <b>Disrupt</b> <br><br>  23rd beginning of the conference.  In the presentation hall, there is a constant interviewing of invited guests, expert panels and presentations of companies that participate in Battlefield. <br><br>  Here is who you can meet at the conference: <br>  - investors <br>  - entrepreneurs <br>  - startups <br>  - experts from large companies <br>  - journalists (including TechCrunch) <br><br>  Investors are those people who will give money for a project, so it was very, very interesting for me to see them live, hear, feel how they think, and what they care about.  Especially liked Fred Wilson, Ron Conway. <br><br>  Entrepreneurs.  It inspires live to see the creators of successful startups, from which you can learn a lot.  There was Foursquare, Tumblr, Instagram. <br>  Foursquare (Dennis Crowley) showed how they will be integrated into the future Android. <br>  Ashton Kutcher (yes, yes! The same) is also a successful entrepreneur. <br><br>  Startups  In this category, I wanted to see the next Facebook. <br>  As we are making mobile apps, the idea of ‚Äã‚ÄãDoat, which could shake Google‚Äôs dominant search position on mobile devices, seemed very clear and interesting.  Or others are not particularly impressed. <br>  In the hall, where are the stands of all startups who bought tickets Startup Valley, but not necessarily participate in Battlefield.  When the break begins, the hall turns into a bazaar.  Each startup starts its startup left and right.  There is no other word for it.  Picks up. <br>  Even on the Hackathon, I noted for myself, every start-uper has tremendous confidence that he is doing the next Facebook.  Like it's in the blood.  How many pathos in each presentation.  ‚ÄúYou have always dreamed about ... But today, today, the world will change ..‚Äù I heard 5 - 10 times a day. <br><br>  The experts.  They say, discuss, felled startups.  I even wanted to get on stage, to take part in the action. <br><br>  Journalists.  Conduct interviews, create a unique atmosphere.  Mike Arlington is inimitable.  A unique sense of humor and a constant equanimity. <br><br>  Today the session continues.  Here is a small <a href="http://360.io/s4aDRU">panorama with Disrupt.Techcrunch</a> .  Tomorrow is the final day. <br><br>  <b>Disrupt in pictures:</b> <br><img src="http://ibearsoft.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Photo-May-24-10-50-01-AM.jpg" alt="image">  I wanted to paint something, but there it is allowed to a special artist and nothing more. <img src="http://ibearsoft.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Photo-May-24-10-49-44-AM.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  I want to finish with small <b>conclusions</b> : <br>  - Paul Graham (YCombinator), whose role in Russia is played by Moreynis, said that they invest primarily in people.  Flexibility of mind, determination to achieve goals, team.  They invest in those who are ‚Äújust like us‚Äù (they are the ones). <img src="http://ibearsoft.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Photo-May-24-9-24-43-AM.jpg" alt="image"><br>  - Want to meet with investors - listen to questions from presentations of startups.  These are the questions that will be asked to you. <br>  - Attitudes towards Russia are controversial.  It is mentioned with respect Yuri Milner, and at the presentation of the product they say "and with the help of this product we can trace that the links lead to some Russian DNS server".  Then they make a reservation ‚ÄúI have nothing against the Russians.  I have many Russian friends. ‚Äù  But you get the idea. <br>  - Attracting investment is not so difficult.  This can be seen because what money is attracted to doubtful projects ($ 0.2 - $ 1.5 mln., But what is spent is not clear). <br><br>  And one more remark from the conference - ‚ÄúStart young, are stupid yet, so as not to understand that it is impossible to realize your project‚Äù. <br><br>  Good luck to all! <br><br>  References: <br>  <a href="http://disrupt.techcrunch.com/">Disrup TechCrunch.</a>  <a href="http://disrupt.techcrunch.com/">Official site</a> <br>  <a href="http://ycombinator.com/">YCombinator</a> <br>  <a href="http://crunchbase.com/">CrunchBase - information on people spinning in the IT environment</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/119918/">https://habr.com/ru/post/119918/</a></p>
