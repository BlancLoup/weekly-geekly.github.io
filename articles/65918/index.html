Where, in trouble, you can only rely on yourself and hope that there will be another person, the precepts that parents gave us: ‚ÄúThe elder helps the younger, the strong - the weak, the healthy - the sick, and the person in need needs help, even if you risk your life "- have a special value.  Often at the cost of life became expensive equipment and raw materials: when rescuing a person on a broken winter road, a golden amalgam semi-trailer was drowned - and nobody had anything for it, because while working there, people should know that they would be saved at any cost.  They have nothing else but life. <br><br>  I have not lived there for a long time, but wherever I am, I always try to help people near me, so they brought me up.  Therefore, two years ago, when I learned that two students of my university were shot down during the transition and they urgently needed blood materials, I went to the hospital as a donor.  After answering where I can donate blood, I almost got drunk.  I do not have a local registration - I can not be a donor!  But the mother of one of the students who was there at the time could not persuade the doctors!

      Two years have passed, there is a severe lack of blood in the state, there are 13 donors per 1,000 people, and at least 40 are needed, in the same Europe there are 46, and in America 60. With the support of the state, the said donor day was announced.  And what's the point ?! <br><br>  Nobody was going to change the rules.  Today he called blood donation points and the answer is the same everywhere - there is no registration, there is no blood.  No ... really made one assumption.  In order to donate blood, you must live in Novosibirsk (actually everything happens here) for six months, and you can confirm this either with a certificate from work / school, or a certificate from a clinic.  But what can you do if I changed jobs two months ago, and always walked around the hospital per kilometer?  And nothing - go to the forest. <br><br>  It turns out that out of so few healthy and ready to donate blood people are sown by donors.  And then hair is torn on the head: where is the blood to take, there are no donors.  And so it turns out with us in everything: with a small business, with engineers, scientists - help help help, but they cannot help.  How many times it is said: ‚Äúno need to help - you do not interfere with the main thing‚Äù. <br><br>  By the way, the argument about registration: we have to keep records, then all sorts of subsidies, discounts, payments and indulgences.  Yes, I do not care for them.  Let me donate my blood! <br><br>  And so it turns out that the price of the life of one of us can only be a missing registration. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/65918/">https://habr.com/ru/post/65918/</a></p>
