  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Microsoft recognizes the failure of Windows Vista</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Microsoft recognized what many have been saying all the time - Windows Vista, also known as Windows Millennium 2, is just a joke that no one really wants. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  This week there were two unprecedented events that literally drove us into a stupor. <br><br>  First, Dell announced the renewal of the Windows XP offer in the home PC sector.  Since the advent of Windows Vista, Microsoft has been doing everything possible to complicate the sale of everything that is different from the new Millennium.  Try Microsoft to do something similar in business - they would immediately point the door, but the general public will have something to give. <br><br>  This is nothing more than a classic example of using its monopoly position, and Microsoft ate a dog on it.  Using its usual methods, such as twisting hands, the corporation once again ‚Äúbuilt‚Äù all the leading OEM manufacturers.  Before no one dared to contradict, fearing to incur the wrath of the software giant. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

      <br>
      However, Dell did it.  This means that the new Millennium, as we expected, is really selling poorly, the situation with the programs and drivers is deplorable, and Dell had no choice but to bang.  And if someone thinks that this is an act of redemption in front of outraged customers for trying to fool us into a poor-quality thing, think carefully again, no one really cares about customers. <br><br>  It happened so, although manufacturers are forced to deal with Microsoft, discontent is only driven deeper.  And although the huge neon sign ‚ÄúProblem‚Äù just glows above the new product, it will be sold.  Microsoft has driven OEM manufacturers into a corner, keeps them at gunpoint and they do what they are ordered to, but you can literally hear the tramp of deserters running across to the Linux camp.  Redistribution occurs right before our eyes. <br><br>  Another failure of the new Millennium?  Yes please, this is Gates selling Windows Vista in China for only $ 3.  Why is this not altruism?  This returns to the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãhow piracy has helped strengthen the monopoly of Microsoft.  If it is easy to steal Windows, then Linux no longer has its price advantage; both systems cost nothing. <br><br>  In the case of the new operating system, Microsoft has made piracy a difficult task.  Of course, you can still hack the system, but the trick is that the bar is raised high enough and many will have to pay.  Are you ready to argue that in a country with an average salary of one hundred dollars the people will not fork out and pay $ 299 for it is not clear how a working system? <br><br>  What did Microsoft do?  Just dropped the price a hundred or so times.  This is not to say that this is an unprecedented step, when Office 2003, which was difficult for illegal use, was released, Microsoft backtracked and lowered the price of the student license to $ 150.  But this time things are much worse. <br><br>  Even if, according to Microsoft, you can be considered poor now, the corporation still wants to take you back, one day you can probably afford a full version.  However, this is a dangerous way, if the cost of software increases the cost of a computer by one hundred percent, people may think about an alternative. <br><br>  This will mean ‚Äúno‚Äù to digital rights control in the new system, there will not be new mass transitions to the confusing proprietary file formats of the new Office, and even worse, people may start asking the question ‚Äúwhy‚Äù - why should we take something containing in itself Microsoft.  And this will be a big problem for the corporation. <br><br>  So, without thinking properly, Microsoft dropped the price.  We will not bother you by enumerating the statements of managers that people who cannot afford clean water will be happy to sell a kidney for the sake of a new version of Office, believe me, all these statements are taking place.  What used to be a sacred cow, now just nothing decisive hamburger. <br><br>  The corporation has lost the opportunity for coarse pressure, and there is nothing left for it but to die.  She can not stand fair competition and goes back down, throwing off the price almost a hundred times. <br><br>  All we see is unprecedented changes in the balance of power.  In addition, this is an unprecedented recognition of its own failure.  And you know what's funny in all these movements?  They are all wrong.  Microsoft has serious problems. <br><br>  Original Source: <a href="http://uk.theinquirer.net/">The Inquirer.net</a> <br>  Translation: VadimS <br>  Source: <a href="http://news.softodrom.ru/ap/b1754.shtml">Softodrom.ru</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/7668/">https://habr.com/ru/post/7668/</a></p>
