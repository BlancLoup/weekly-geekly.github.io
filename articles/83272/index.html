Successful man, in full bloom.  Now he is engaged in business, and then we worked with him together on one of the TV channels.  And it seems that his salary was not transcendental, and he somehow managed to allow himself something that others could not.  Once I asked what the secret was, he replied that the <b>main thing is not only to earn a lot, but also to spend it correctly</b> .  According to him, many of our compatriots do not know how to count money.  This is the so-called false economy.  For example, a person working in the city center, rents an apartment on the Okarin, and <b>thinks</b> that it saves.  But if you count how much money he spends on gasoline, how much time he spends on traffic jams, how many important meetings he missed because of these jams, it becomes clear that the <b>guy is in deep minus</b> .

    <h6>  <b>But this is all the lyrics, back to dinner.</b> </h6><br>  So, about 5 years ago, Alexander Viktorovich asked me a question - where do I eat at home or in a restaurant.  I replied that I was at home.  Well, of course, I went to restaurants, but occasionally, but when it comes to daily food intake, then most often it is at home. <br><br>  And then he began to explain to me that <b>food in a restaurant is much cheaper than homemade food</b> .  All his reasoning can be put into mathematical calculations. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Suppose you are an employee of something there, with an average monthly salary, let's say ... <b>25,000 rubles</b> .  You have an 8-hour working day, a five-day week, that is, 40 hours a week.  Multiply 40 by 4, it turns out 160 working hours per month.  Now we find out the cost of your hour: for this we divide 25,000 rubles into 160 hours, we get 156 rubles and 25 kopecks.  Let‚Äôs round up, let it be <b>150 rubles - this is the cost of your work hour.</b> <br><br><h6>  <b>Now let's calculate how much it will cost us 1 lunch.</b> </h6><br>  Naturally, it should consist of the first, second and compote.  How much time will it take you to do all this frying?  Well, in order not only to heat up, but to cook the salt dish, fry the meat, garnish there, and compote.  I think 2-3 hours.  But that's not all, because the products need to buy.  A trip to the market ( <i>to the store</i> ) will take another hour and a half, plus nerves.  But it is too early to put a dot on this, then you need to wash the dishes with you, and this is again time. <br><br>  Thus, it turns out that you spend about four hours for one dinner.  Four hours for 150 rubles each, is it <b>600</b> ?  And at the same time, a lot of unloved cases ( <i>queues, traffic jams, "work" at the stove ...</i> ).  And if your salary is over 25,000? <br><br>  At the same time, a <b>business lunch on average costs 200-250 rubles</b> .  <b>And no problems</b> : they will cook you, bring them, then wash the dishes for you.  And the real time savings, because cafes and restaurants are now full, and you can find a convenient option near the house, and next to work.  As a result, eating, along with the road to the restaurant and from, will take an hour. <br><br>  So it turns out that <b>it is better to pay 250 rubles for lunch at a restaurant, and spend 3 hours saved on ‚Äúmaking‚Äù money</b> .  Thus, it will turn out that you will remain in the black.  Count for yourself: 3 hours for 150 rubles = 450, minus 250 for lunch = <b>200 rubles in your pocket</b> ( <i>multiply this figure by the number of meals per day, followed by the number of days per year</i> ).  Like this. <br><br>  I do not undertake to subscribe to these thoughts.  Of course, there are a lot of controversial issues here, in my opinion.  Take at least the fact that at home we usually do not cook for one time.  However, if you read out thoroughly, in principle, the same figures will be obtained ( <i>we did not add to the cost of gasoline, depreciation of the car, and so on</i> ).  But nevertheless, the share of common sense in these thoughts is still there.  In any case, make you think.  What are you thinking about now? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/83272/">https://habr.com/ru/post/83272/</a></p>
