The article caused a heated discussion, so I bring to your attention one more opinion on this view under the symbolic name "Higher Education 2". <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Let's start with an analysis of the arguments of the devil's attorney: <br>  <i>1. Higher education is a mandatory requirement for employment, resumes without a w / o are not considered in large companies.</i> <br><br>  Partly true.  Large companies, as a rule, do not look at the crust if there is one, but the lack of it can cause additional questions.  And if you answer the question ‚Äúwhy you do not have higher education‚Äù, ‚Äúyes, because it doesn‚Äôt need it,‚Äù then you can say with 99% probability that you will not get a job in this company.

      Take, for example, highly technological Israel: <br><br>  <i>5% of GNP is spent on scientific research in the country.</i>  <i>This is the highest proportion of the cost of science in the world, in the United States the cost of science does not exceed 3%.</i>  <i>Growth rates of investments in research work far exceeded GDP growth rates: 126% versus 29%.</i>  <i>The cost of research and development in Israel in 2006 is $ 8 billion. In the list of the top 100 European IT companies, Israeli firms have at least 20 positions.</i>  <i>In the world power competitiveness rating for 2006, compiled by the World Economic Forum (WEF), the country ranks 15th out of 125. According to the BDI (Business Date Israel) report, Israel has the third largest among 148 countries in the number of patents for 10 thousand people.</i>  <i>For 1999-2003</i>  <i>the number of Israeli patents registered in the United States increased by 63%.</i>  <i>1, 28% of all scientific articles published in the world are written in the country.</i>  <i>At the same time, in the field of mathematics and computer science, the proportion is even higher: 2, 74% and 2, 22%, respectively.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Since the beginning of the 70s in Israel, one after another, branches of such giants as Motorola, IBM, Intel, Microsoft, Cisco, Texas Instruments and many others began to open.</i>  <i>In the same years, the state concerns of the military-industrial complex received powerful development: Taasia Avirit, RAFAEL, Kur and others.</i>  <i>Such large-scale projects were carried out at their enterprises and laboratories as the creation of rocket complexes, telecommunication systems, combat aircraft and avionics, and space satellites.</i>  <i>A new generation of engineers and scientists has grown on these developments.</i>  <i>The technological breakthrough at the turn of the 90s coincided with the global information technology boom.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Israel is one of the major players in the global software market.</i>  <i>There are more than 1,000 software development companies operating in the country, covering almost all areas of the IT industry.</i>  <i>According to the Israeli Association of Software Manufacturers, software exports have increased by 700% over the past 10 years.</i>  <i>Software exports and related technologies exceeded $ 6 billion.</i> <br><br>  The reason - the development of R &amp; D, investment, world-class universities.  At the same time, a specialist who does not have a crust of the desired level (second grade) will not get a job at an IT company by default.  At the same time, only those who want to link future work with science and research go to the third grade.  Those.  It is very difficult to meet candidates and doctors in the IT sector, since they all work in scientific institutes and universities.  Therefore, a clear separation of science and IT should be present, but that is another question. <br><br>  <i>2. Higher education shows that a person can achieve his goals, he has the ability to study difficult and useless things, he has perseverance.</i> <br>  Absolutely wrong.  Higher education can show that a person wanted to study, exactly like the fact that a person did not want to study, but he was forced (stuffed by parents, a person mows down from the army and a million other possible reasons). <br><br>  <i>3. Higher education broadens the mind, gives the foundation.</i> <br>  Sure.  A person who has graduated from university even into triples thinks much more fundamentally than a person without a military education.  (here you can partly include part-time studies).  To argue with this is pointless. <br><br>  Once I spoke with a person who graduated from one of the top Kiev economic universities (he studied at the correspondence department), while communicating with him, it became clear that the person who studied economics independently (and who learned many clever words and terms) did not understand the elementary things ‚Äî for example, pricing principles in the market, causes of inflation / deflation, etc.  The reason is simple - the lack of communication with other people, teachers, as well as the absence of situations-paradoxes, which make people deal with a certain problem at a fundamental level. <br><br>  <i>4. Higher education teaches a person to learn.</i> <br>  Indeed, it teaches - sometimes to the detriment. <br><br>  <i>Reading the finished documentation (which someone has already written!) Is the simplest of methods (consumption of ready-made in a convenient form for consumption).</i> <br>  Who said that?  This is the opinion of the author of the article, which, it seems to me, has little in common with reality. <br><br>  I will explain.  Different people perceive information differently.  Someone easier to read the bare specification, someone loves video tutorials, someone - books.  The presence on the market of a huge number of books, tutorials speaks in defense of this opinion.  This can include technical conferences, live meetings, seminars, etc.  Therefore, to say that documentation is a panacea is, at least, stupid. <br><br>  <i>A person can learn what interests him.</i>  <i>What is really needed is what concerns him.</i> <br>  Here I would like to ask the author of the article: when did he understand <b>what</b> he really needs and what is <b>really interesting for</b> him?  How often did the author change his views on life, interests, hobbies, habits?  Most young people still cannot understand <b>what they are interested in and what they need</b> .  A university is a great opportunity by trial and error to <i>find</i> what is interesting.  A very small percentage knows this precisely from an early age.  Over time, many people can understand that the occupation that they have chosen is not what they want to do all their life and then a logical question arises, and what then to do if he knows only this area?  Re-learn?  Starting from scratch?  And if again by, and if a person underestimates his strength?  The result can be any. <br><br>  <i>Note, not a single argument, which would be reduced to "they will teach you what you need in the work."</i> <br>  I do not know why this point was discarded, but, however sad it may be with our education, some of the knowledge is still used in the work. <br><br><h4>  And now let's move on to our argument ... </h4><br>  As I said above, the university gives you the opportunity to try yourself in different areas and find what is really interesting for a person.  I will never believe that a young man, after leaving school, can firmly say what he wants to do and at the same time be sure that this is really what is needed for him. <br><br>  Further, the university <i>does not interfere with</i> work and self-study.  Well, does not interfere.  Another question is that in the process of joint training and work, you should spend less time on beer, discos and girls, but with the right approach this will not be a problem.  The right combination of training and work does wonders.  For example, in lectures on philosophy I read project specifications and thought about solving problems, and lectures on labor protection were the ideal time to read freshly bought newspapers and magazines.  The same time was devoted to communication with peers, discussions of new films, etc.  Therefore, when a person tells me that he has not graduated from the university, because there is nothing to do there, then, most likely, <i>he was simply kicked out from there because of bugs in the DNA</i> .  Another friend of mine opened his business in the third year and came to the university only at the session, and despite this, he successfully completed it.  <i>Keywords - ‚Äúcame‚Äù and ‚Äúfinished‚Äù</i> .  Still that nihilist, by the way, but common sense is not deprived. <br><br>  By the way, I already wrote on this topic: <a href="http://msug.vn.ua/blogs/science/archive/2010/01/24/who-whats-that-finds.aspx">Who wants, he is looking for opportunities, who does not want - looking for reasons</a> .  About the philosophy and the uselessness of objects.  I propose to read the article <a href="http://msug.vn.ua/blogs/science/archive/2010/07/11/philosophy-of-science-or-why-we-trust-science.aspx">‚ÄúThe Philosophy of Science or Why Do We Trust Science?‚Äù</a> On this subject. <br><br>  Now the background.  I often find myself thinking that it is difficult for me to communicate with self-taught programmers.  Firstly, because they have their own concepts and beliefs.  In other words, we think in different categories.  But if, after a university course of optimization, you understand the difference between ‚Äúsearch optimization‚Äù and ‚Äúsearch optimization‚Äù, then it is very difficult to explain this to a person who is far from it.  Or, for example, when a person first sees the transformation matrix, and the second week cannot do an elementary transformation, it becomes sad.  We also constantly have to see advertisements in the metro ala ‚ÄúMaking websites.  Inexpensive.  Bring in the top 10. $ 50.  Misha.  No comments. <br><br>  Do you think that you need to learn only <i>what is needed directly for work</i> ?  This tells me that a person is no longer interested in anything.  Most likely, he is just an ordinary gray mouse, without goals and motivation.  But this is the main reason why a person can say that in addition to programming in a technical college, nothing more is needed.  But what about rhetoric, art, physical education, basic economics, marketing.  Or will the average self-taught programmer learn this too?  Do not make me laugh.  But this knowledge defines a person not only as a specialist, but also as a <i>person</i> . <br><br>  We go further.  Grants, student exchanges, educational programs, student discounts are all secondary, but still worth mentioning. <br><br>  And now the paradoxes and rhetorical questions: <ul><li>  articles about the uselessness of higher education are written, as a rule, by people with higher education.  If a person is so smart that  no need, why he didn‚Äôt figure it out while studying? </li><li>  often such articles are written by serious guys (read the owners of IT companies and CEOs).  Why?  Most likely, it is not profitable for them that all around are smart specialists, because, basically, the entire domestic IT industry is form-based.  Why do we have to be Americans or Jews, when even for form-blindness there you have to pay transcendental money?  Better a couple of students and cheaper, which will add several seniors in the resume and an extra year or two of experience and sell at a price lower than the average for the market, and then let jokes about the Hindu code be born.  Speak no connection?  There is also some; </li><li>  Why did the previous article gain more than two hundred pluses (which suggests that there is no need for military education), and a <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/arbeit/99062/">survey on this topic suggests</a> that the majority ‚Äúhave a higher education and it is connected with current activities‚Äù? </li></ul><h4>  findings </h4><br>  Tezisno: <ul><li>  Not all people are the same. </li><li>  Unnecessary v.o.  should not be explained by the existence of problems in our education system. </li><li>  The examples of Gates and Page cannot be extrapolated to all people. </li><li>  A person should develop in different directions, and not only in the sphere of professional activity - this will not give self-education in its pure form. </li><li>  Often, bribes and connections compensate for the need for knowledge, so it seems that they are useless. </li><li>  Dissent is now considered a sign of elitism. </li><li>  It is strange that there are people who believe in.  unnecessary. </li></ul>  I suggest to get acquainted <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/search%3Fq%3Dmath%2Bneeded">with the discussions on stackoverflow</a> , where the best minds of the IT world are gathered. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/99623/">https://habr.com/ru/post/99623/</a></p>
