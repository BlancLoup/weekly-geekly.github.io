  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Incompatibility of the Sony Ericsson Xperia X10 and some Beeline towers</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/67bd81ec/b3292ea7/829fb824/62761557.png" align="left">  Sony Ericsson has released an excellent line of smartphones Xperia X10, which, unfortunately, conflict with the equipment of some towers BeeLine and, possibly, MTS.  The problem looks like a periodic reboot of the device in some areas, is widespread, at least in the suburbs outside the Moscow Ring Road.  <a href="http://4pda.ru/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D198381">Discussion of this problem on the w3bsit3-dns.com forum</a> takes about 40 pages already, has some rather extreme ways to solve the problem, and not a single non-extreme and at the same time working, and the first message dates back to December 7, that is, the problem has been at least a year.  Representatives of Beeline and Sony Ericsson, it seems, have eliminated themselves from solving the problem and are blaming each other.  If you are thinking about buying this phone or using it on the Beeline network, then perhaps you should abandon this step. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  It all started with the fact that his wife bought a new XPeria X10 mini pro, which, unfortunately, rebooted at intervals from 10 seconds to 15 minutes.  At first, thinking that the problem was in the device, they changed it twice.  Then, noting that there were no such problems with the Megaphone SIM card, the Beeline SIM card was replaced with the zero result, but it became clear that the problem was not with the phone, or at least not with it.  Beeline representatives on the forum and official phones were not aware of this problem, as well as <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/qa/11371/">habrazhiteli</a> .

      Then the following steps were taken: updating the official firmware to version 2.3.4, and then to the unofficial Cyanogenmod 7.1.0, with the same result.  Having smoked Google, a long-suffering thread was found on the forum w3bsit3-dns.com, filled with weeping, wailing and experiments of varying degrees of success.  To date, the only way that can completely eliminate the problem is to roast the phone for a few minutes in the oven at a temperature of 200-250 degrees, or to change the operator. <br><br>  In June, a Beeline representative appeared at the forum, who said that the current situation in the company is known, but the timing for solving the problem is unclear and asked him to unsubscribe from those who have it reproduced and under what circumstances.  By itself, the fact that Biline employees come into contact with users is very pleasant and shows the degree of responsibility, which is good news. <br><br>  In the process of correspondence, it turned out that the problem leading to the phone reboot was found, it was caused by some equipment on some Beeline towers and it would be solved by a patch of equipment that should be released after some time.  Clarifying, he added that the problem was not only from Beeline, but also from Sony Ericsson, whose software incorrectly handles some abnormal situations. <br><br>  However, about a month and a half has passed since the moment of the correspondence, and there has been no solution to the problem either. <br><br>  It remains to say that in itself a wonderful phone Sony Ericsson Xperia X10 mini pro is on the shelf, and a solution to the problem does not seem to be foreseen.  There are also several questions for habrizhiteli - what the problem may actually be, how warming up can fix the situation, whether a programmatic way to solve it is possible, as well as any other thoughts and ideas. <br><br>  <b>[UPD]</b> <br>  Information came from Beeline that the problem is that the switches send some service commands that cause the smartphone to restart.  Patches that could fix the situation should be released by third-party equipment suppliers.  However, no service commands should not cause a reboot of the device, so it is obvious that the problem is in the design of the smartphone itself. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/133075/">https://habr.com/ru/post/133075/</a></p>
