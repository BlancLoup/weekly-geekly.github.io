But do they know what dangers await on the way to a bright SCRUM future?  In the report we will try to answer this question.  So, typical attacks on developers' infrastructure through continuous integration tools will be considered, as well as a number of identified bugs in various open source and not-so products. </div></div><br><br>  <b>‚ÄúWhen opened, the warranty is void, or attacks on MPLS networks‚Äù</b> <b><br></b>  <b>Speaker: <a href="http://2015.zeronights.ru/dokladchiki">Georgi Geshev</a></b> <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Description of the report</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) ‚Äîmultiprotocol switching using tags ‚Äî is by far the most popular technology commonly used to provide large-scale reliable data transport services, as well as to transmit delay sensitive traffic (voice and video).  As it turned out, MPLS remains a highly unexplored area. <br>  In his report, Georgi will talk about the main research in the field of MPLS, the critical vulnerabilities that it contains and may adversely affect the work of leading vendors.  The speaker will present the main types of existing MPLS, describe the concept and define the terminology.  The audience will also get acquainted with the network topology and key traffic management strategies. <br>  The report will present a number of techniques, using which an attacker can obtain information on internal LSR IP addresses, thus partially or fully revealing the MPLS backbone Label Switching Router (LSR) connection scheme.  The report will also examine various scenarios of attacks on the infrastructure of service providers and, further, on buyers of MPLS domains.  It should be noted that none of the attacks presented in the report require access to the MPLS backbone.  In other words, the presented attacks are implemented from the perspective of an MPLS network client. <br>  In conclusion, both general solutions and recommendations will be announced, as well as suggestions for vendors that will make it possible to protect MPLS networks from attacks as much as possible. </div></div><br><br>  <b>"SmartTV: how to assemble an insecure device in the modern world"</b> <b><br></b>  <b>Speaker: <a href="http://2015.zeronights.ru/dokladchiki">Sergey Belov</a></b> <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Description of the report</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  SmartTV, like other IoT, is increasingly penetrating our lives.

In addition to this, targeted attacks using malware are no longer the exception, but rather the rule.  Analysts and companies use different types of automation to cope with this problem, but the gaps still remain.  Reverse engineering is becoming increasingly challenging due to the increasing workload and the tight time frame for it.  This is directly reflected in the research process, and the prevention of new threats becomes even more difficult. <br>  In the present paper, the authors will discuss common reverse techniques using an intermediate presentation (thanks to the Hex-Rays team for their help in this study) in a clustered environment.  The presented results demonstrate different types of use of this approach, for example, for the detection of algorithmic similarity between VPO groups. <br>  The higher level of abstraction provided by the Hex-Rays tool is based on an abstract syntax tree (ctree).  This feature facilitates the study of DGA (domain name generation algorithms), custom cryptography and specific parsers for these configurations.  In order to reduce the number of false results when identifying metadata in some C ++ compilers, such as virtual function tables and RTTI, the authors created object-oriented artifacts directly from the analyzed VPO. <br>  Already more than 2 million samples of malware are analyzed, of which their characteristics are highlighted, and this is a serious information base allowing to improve the analysis and fight against future threats.  Using this knowledge, other researchers in this field will be able to isolate ctree (syntactic trees) from new samples and compare them with the millions obtained earlier. <br>  All materials presented during the presentation, as well as the source materials of the analyzed samples, will be available to researchers, along with new ideas for further development.  The plugin developed by Hex-Rays Decompiler, along with tools for analyzing / automating the allocation of the characteristics of malware, will also be available to the audience on GitHub. <br>  An updated version of the BlackHat Las Vegas 2015 report will be presented at ZeroNights. </div></div><br><br>  <b>"Network of controlled browsers based on BeEF and Google Drive"</b> <b><br></b>  <b>Speakers: <a href="http://2015.zeronights.ru/dokladchiki">Denis Kolegov</a> , <a href="http://2015.zeronights.ru/dokladchiki">Oleg Broslavsky</a> , <a href="http://2015.zeronights.ru/dokladchiki">Nikita Oleksov</a></b> <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Description of the report</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  The report describes the study of the possibility of implementing the mechanism of interaction of controlled browsers (hooked browsers) via Google Drive within the framework of the BeEF framework.

All these systems have their own log formats, various user interfaces and can generate from several thousand alerts per day.  In such a situation, there is an acute problem of collecting all these events, analyzing them, and receiving notifications by mail.  At the same time, sometimes you want a couple of mouse clicks to make the necessary selection of events and build graphs on them.  The existing SIEMs on the market either cost a lot or are free, but greatly reduced versions of paid products.  The report will show how to build a system for analyzing OSSEC, Snort, Suricata and Cisco ASA logs with Elasticsearch, Logstash and Kibana with SQL-like search, flexible email notification management, scalable multi-tier architecture out of the box.  At the end of the presentation, a link to the ansible playbook will be given, which will install all the necessary components on the server and configure them so that you can start analyzing your logs without wasting time. </div></div><br><br>  <b>"Banking Trojans: a look from the other side"</b> <b><br></b>  <b>Speaker: <a href="http://2015.zeronights.ru/dokladchiki">Alexey Levin</a></b> <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Description of the report</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  We, as developers of the client-bank system, are constantly confronted with the theft of money from bank customers using Trojans.  The most dangerous Trojans use automatic loading and hiding of payments on the client‚Äôs computer with the java-program changing behavior on the fly.  The report is dedicated to such Trojans, protection from them and technologies that we develop for this. We will talk about the tools we use, consider the effectiveness of these tools, discuss additional protection methods (for example, monitoring constant-pool integrity and using invokedynamic). </div></div><br><br>  <b>"Automation of web application scanning - Yandex experience"</b> <b><br></b>  <b>Speaker: <a href="http://2015.zeronights.ru/dokladchiki">Eldar Zaitov</a></b> <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Description of the report</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Anyone who tries to implement application security scanning as a process faces a similar set of difficulties.

Browser on ZN </h4><br>  Partner of the ZN conference, Yandex, announced the month of searching for vulnerabilities in Yandex Browser.  The initiative's goal is to find out if there are any weak points in the new security system that Yandex specialists are not aware of yet. <br>  The conditions of the contest are simple: anyone can try to hack the browser and inform the company about the found vulnerability.  Participants who have discovered the most serious problems will receive a cash reward.  The prize for the first place will be 500 thousand rubles, for the second and third - 300 thousand and 150 thousand rubles, respectively.  Yandex is interested in vulnerabilities that can violate the confidentiality or integrity of user data.  The types of errors that will be taken into account are listed in <a href="http://download.cdn.yandex.net/browser/ZN/rules.pdf">the contest rules</a> . <br>  Messages can be sent before November 20 through a <a href="https://yandex.ru/bugbounty/report/">special feedback form</a> .  The results of the competition will be announced on the 26th day at the <a href="http://2015.zeronights.ru/">ZeroNights-2015</a> conference.  If you cannot be there, do not worry: the names of the winners will be published also in <a href="http://clubs.ya.ru/yandexbrowser/">the Yandex.Browser club</a> . <br><br><h4>  Attention - competition from Qiwi - at ZERONIGHTS </h4><br>  At the ZERONIGHTS conference, guests of the event will be able to take part in the search for vulnerabilities in the QIWI payment terminals.  Three fully working terminals (including the ‚Äútransparent‚Äù model that users love) will be available throughout the conference. <br><br>  Prohibited: <br><ul><li>  carry out destructive actions with the terminal, which can lead to its physical damage </li><li>  carry out attacks on the bill acceptor‚Äôs sensors (fake bills, fishing, attacks on the COM port) </li></ul><br>  Permitted: <br><ul><li>  use master keys for physical access to terminal equipment </li><li>  connect additional equipment to the terminal </li></ul><br>  Of interest are vulnerabilities that lead to the release of the shell of Windows and making fake payments using data received from the terminal.  Depending on the criticality of the detected program errors, the reward can be up to 200 thousand rubles and will be paid in the framework of the current bug bounty Qiwi program. <br>  And yes, of course!  At the conference there will be souvenir stickers, T-shirts and other small, but such pleasant pleasures :) <br>  Please note that registration for the ZERONIGHTS 2015 conference closes at 21:00 on November 23.  After this time, tickets for the event will not be available.  This year we decided to limit ourselves to registering online, so, on the spot, to pay for participation, unfortunately, will not work.  We kindly ask you not to postpone the visit to this page for the last days, because, as always, there are a lot of those who want it: <a href="http://2015.zeronights.ru/registraciya.html">2015.zeronights.ru/registraciya.html</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/270729/">https://habr.com/ru/post/270729/</a></p>
