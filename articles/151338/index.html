In this topic, I want to share with you figures and considerations on the topic ‚ÄúDoes it make sense to make an application in Odnoklassniki‚Äù. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  A short introduction for those who have not read the full story: we have the ‚Äú <a href="http://www.odnoklassniki.ru/apps/cards">Postcards</a> ‚Äù application, the essence of the application is clear from the title.  The application has 20+ million registered users, it is in the top of applications in the ‚ÄúEntertainment‚Äù section. <br><br><h5>  First, some statistics: </h5><br><ul><li>  In a month, the application is used by 3 to 5 million people. </li><li>  In the summer, when everyone is on vacation and generally lazy, with the help of the application, 100k cards per day are still sent. </li><li>  At peak times (for example, on New Year's Eve), people send up to 25 postcards per second. </li><li>  In the online application in such moments is up to 25 000 people. </li></ul>

    <h5>  Who are these people? </h5><br>  The picture from Odnoklassniki's internal statistics illustrates the portrait of the ‚ÄúPostcards‚Äù audience: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c68/4ea/9fc/c684ea9fcd4e0c9da44fc3824efaee2f.png"><br><br>  As you can see, these are mainly adults 30 and above, and usually women.  This entails certain nuances, which I will discuss below. <br><br><h5>  What difficulties to expect if you are thinking about making an application for Odnoklassniki? </h5><br>  1. Your application may simply not approve, and without much explanation.  Therefore, before you do something, carefully review the rules of the applications and get approval that Odnoklassniki, in principle, can accept this type of application.  Read in detail <a href="http://dev.odnoklassniki.ru/wiki/display/ok/Odnoklassniki.ru%2BThird%2BParty%2BPlatform">here</a> and do everything as it is written there. <br><br>  2. The rules for the functioning of applications are quite rigid.  Many things can not be done, even if you really want. <br><br>  3. Immediately think about technical support.  There will be a lot of questions from users, even with the simplest functionality.  If it seems to you that you know how to make simple interfaces, the Odnoklassniki audience will prove that you are mistaken. <br><br>  4. Communication with technical support of Odnoklassniki concerning the functioning of the API does not always pass quickly.  They use Jira, but creating your own ticket for each problem will not work, you will have to communicate in one big ticket for your application, this can lead to confusion and misunderstanding. <br><br>  5. You will need a good hosting + knowledge of building a high-load service.  With a successful scenario, of course. <br><br><h5>  Now the positive points: </h5><br>  1. The <b>audience, which is accustomed to pay for buns.</b>  Specially bold, this is a very important point.  From communication with colleagues who port applications to different social networks of the RuNet, I concluded that Odnoklassniki of them is the most profitable. <br><br>  2. The single currency (OK), which in fact represents itself the Russian ruble.  Users buy OK in different ways (from SMS to credit cards) and spend them in any applications.  You decide when, for what and how much to take OK from users. <br><br>  3. A distinct and railway policy of withdrawing earned money.  In our case (the company is not a resident of the Russian Federation) Odnoklassniki take 58% of the money transferred by users to the application account, 42% transfer us to the bank account. <br><br>  4. A pretty good ‚Äúshowcase‚Äù for new applications that helps a quick start.  We scored the first million users in 2 weeks, all this time we were in ‚ÄúNew Applications‚Äù.  Viral mechanisms that help spread information about applications installed by friends, invite friends to the game, etc., also deserve approval. <br><br>  5. Despite the complex hierarchical structure (Odnoklassniki is a division of <a href="http://corp.mail.ru/">Mail.Ru Group</a> ), you can still reach the people you need.  During the work we have not had a single case where we would not solve a question. <br><br><h5>  From interesting: </h5><br>  Thanks to this application, I finally saw how the ‚ÄúLoot!‚Äù Button actually looks like: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/eb7/099/2e7/eb70992e703ca3479d496042ca2e6d7a.png"><br><br>  Despite her external clumsiness, on a day with a good holiday I want to press it again and again. <br><br><h5>  Economic arithmetic </h5><br><ul><li>  In a month, our application generates from 3 to 12 thousand dollars of income (this is after deducting the share of Odnoklassniki). </li><li>  Payment for hosting in our case is about 700 dollars </li><li>  Other costs are specific for each application, so here you own cards in hand </li></ul><br><br><h5>  Council (if you are going to stir up something for Odnoklassniki): </h5><br>  Most applications in Odnoklassniki (as, indeed, in other networks) are ordinary games, usually ported from other platforms, with minimal social embryos.  It is unlikely that you will be able to drag one more here and make it popular.  Yes, and boring it. <br><br>  The ideal Odnoklassniki app should: <br>  - be designed for a woman over 30 years old (practice understanding the psychology of this audience); <br>  - contain a strong social component - give users the opportunity to interact with friends and acquaintances in new, interesting, positive and visually appealing ways; <br>  - give an incentive to return to the application again and again.  And these are not bonuses and buns - the game still bothers you.  But people value relationships with people. <br><br>  These are really social applications that can and should be invented.  And Odnoklassniki is a good place to try your idea in practice. <br><br>  That's all.  It turned out a bit at the top, not all the questions were clarified, but if anything - ask in the comments, I will answer myself or connect my colleagues. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/151338/">https://habr.com/ru/post/151338/</a></p>
