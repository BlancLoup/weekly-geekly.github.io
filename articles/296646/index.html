And Mavrodi is actively promoting his pyramid on social networks in several countries, saying that "a financial apocalypse is inevitable." <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/FmMB_R7z7f4%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgFx7wT3DMf3L8EjHJ0oMmA5ucePQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <i>Sergey Mavrodi talks about MMM to Chinese citizens</i> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The first financial pyramid of Sergey Mavrodi JSC MMM was registered in Moscow in 1989 as a cooperative and was initially engaged in trade ‚Äî imported computers and accessories into the USSR.  Then the company was engaged in other activities, including advertising and beauty contests.  In 1993, MMM issued 991,000 shares, the price of which was constantly growing.  For six months, the sale of shares prices have increased 127 times, and the number of investors has reached, according to various sources, up to fifteen million people.  On August 4, 1994, Mavrodi was arrested on charges of concealing taxes on the income of the Invest-Consulting firm he heads.  Directly from prison, he began collecting signatures for registration as candidates for the State Duma of the Russian Federation, and on October 30 he became a member of the Russian parliament, which he needed only to obtain immunity.  A year later, Mavrodi was deprived of his mandate, and in December 1997 they were declared in the All-Russian, and later in the international search.  In 1998, Mavrodi opened the Stock Generation - another pyramid, but on the Internet, decorated as a gambling game with the appropriate license and registered in one of the countries of the Caribbean. <br><br>  Later were MMM-2011 and MMM-2012.  Mavrodi directly called MMM-2011 the financial pyramid and warned that money could be lost.  Five months after the opening, the pyramid collapsed.

      During the work of MMM, Mavrodi managed to <a href="http://bg.ru/society/dengi_eto_bumaga-8434/%3Fchapter%3D4">buy the</a> Cray Research Super Server 6400 <a href="http://bg.ru/society/dengi_eto_bumaga-8434/%3Fchapter%3D4">supercomputer</a> to analyze the global stock markets and manage the future empire: he was interested in US law, which he believed did not prevent the creation of such a pyramid. <br><br>  In the new system, which Mavrodi is now actively promoting in Indonesia, China and several other countries, the accounts of participants are participating.  The user can select the function "get" and "assist" in his personal account.  In the second case, the participant enters the amount that is ready to provide, and transfers the money to a specific bank account of another participant.  For providing assistance, he will receive the same amount in the local currency of the system - ‚ÄúMavro‚Äù.  These "Mavro" will begin to grow by 30% per month.  At any moment this currency can be sold, having received real money, promises Sergey Mavrodi. <br><br>  In mid-November, the bitcoin exchange rate, trading at prices ranging from $ 200 to $ 300, <a href="http://geektimes.ru/post/265336/">rose</a> to $ 502.  Later, the rate dropped, according to data on November 23, 2015, it amounts to 319 dollars.  The Financial Times links this jump with Sergey Mavrodi‚Äôs activities in China, where the entrepreneur promises participants of MMM up to 30% per month of the investment and bonuses for advertising the system and attracting new investors.  Bitcoins are required to participate in the system. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0ce/970/6aa/0ce9706aa357f8597035376fa376143f.png" width="600" alt="image"><br><br>  Now the system works in one hundred countries of the world, Kommersant <a href="http://kommersant.ru/doc/2850807">reports</a> with reference to the project sites.  The new MMM is 130 million people.  Mavrodi promotes his project mainly in social networks, sometimes using advertising on television, on radio and in newspapers.  The <a href="https://www.facebook.com/MMMIndiaMavrodi/">MMM India Manav Mukti Manch</a> Facebook page has 137,000 fans, and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/MMMGlobal.SouthAfrica">MMM South Africa has</a> more than 30,000. <br><br>  In China, the creators of financial pyramids face the death penalty.  At the same time, the Chinese are so gambling that there were a lot of pyramids since the 1990s, when the founders of the fund were shot, raising funds for the production of disposable syringes at 6% per month and defaulting.  Kommersant doubts the large number of participants in the system in China: according to journalists, from the middle of November the Chinese MMM site does not open, and under the pseudonym Yun Hun a person sits with an e-mail address rodaslav@yahoo.com and a Russian mobile phone number.  In the Chinese Central Bank received complaints about MMM and study the scheme of the pyramid. <br><br>  On each of the sites and on social networks, Mavrodi says that "a financial apocalypse is inevitable."  He warns participants may lose money.  To bring him to justice after the next failure of the pyramid, the court will have to prove that he deliberately deceived for profit, and the integrity of Mavrodi may work. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/296646/">https://habr.com/ru/post/296646/</a></p>
