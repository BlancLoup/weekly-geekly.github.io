Technically, you receive several digital SMS that reconfigure the SIM card.  In the described connection scheme, roaming is absent as such - the subscriber always connects to the local operator at tariffs that are constantly decreasing.  In <a href="http://comfortway.com/news/">14 countries,</a> we have already reduced the price per gigabyte to a level close to local. <br><br>  SIM card is controlled from the application.  Today, the application supports <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.metr.comfortway%26hl%3Dru">Android</a> and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ru/app/comfortway/id542646378%3Fmt%3D8">iOs</a> operating systems.  Android devices are more stable and this is due to the compliance of devices with the 3GPP standard.  Conceptually, when creating an application, we adhered to the concept of ‚ÄúPlug &amp; Play‚Äù - i.e.  made every effort to ensure that all necessary reconfigurations take place automatically.

This is an undocumented opportunity, since we are still working on the problem of timely purchase of packages in the presence of the Internet and the volume may change without the announcement or the user may receive several such free packages.  You can buy traffic packages after the end of the limit via Wi-Fi. <br><br><h3>  How the application works </h3><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c16/c97/902/c16c97902a23466a96c909e5363fe763.png"></div><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d99/3f2/d03/d993f2d031564e2ab6cdcf436ca22857.png"></div><br>  To start working with the application and get access to your personal account, enter the SIM card number and password indicated on the back of the card, as well as fill in the passport data. <br><br>  To get started, we recommend replenishing the card balance, and remind you that 5 euros have already been credited to the balance.  Replenishment of the card is possible in several ways - through the VISA and Mastercard payment systems or through the PayPal service. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/008/5dd/4c5/0085dd4c5cc44c29a61c1d87c667bd4e.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b88/6cb/471/b886cb4717284de281b866516fb3d4bb.png"><br><br>  After arriving in the country, install the SIM card in your smartphone and run the application.  After that, you need to wait for the registration of the smartphone in the local network and after connecting the launch of the ‚Äúassistant screen‚Äù for setting up ‚ÄúAPN‚Äù.  Magic "Plug &amp; Play" works! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/723/f2e/4ef/723f2e4ef04a4883a53dfdf0e34a6d7d.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9af/938/47f/9af93847f12344c1b489d66534aa9dae.png"><br><br>  In order for our services to work correctly, you need to enable the ‚ÄúData Roaming‚Äù mode in your smartphone and purchase the necessary traffic package. <br><br><h3>  Experience two months </h3><br><ul><li>  We got the first customer experience from public figures and experts - we were tested by Alex Exler.  Alexey Nadezhin, Ilya Shatilin. </li><li>  We started testing the work of CwSim with external devices - 3G-WiFi routers.  Today we guarantee to work with Huawei e5573C and ZTE MF90. </li><li>  We have reduced prices on 14 popular tourist destinations / countries. </li><li>  We have released several updates that improved the work of CwSim. </li></ul><br>  <u>There were difficulties</u> <br><br>  For example, we announced the possibility of choosing several operators in the application in one country and the possibility of buying tariffs in any country at home.  At the last moment before the start of sales, we changed the philosophy of the application and at the moment sell only the tariffs of one operator in the country of stay.  These deviations are temporary and are more associated with the technological risks of the performance of the <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/comfortway/blog/280726/">ComfortWay RSP Platform</a> , which we have already described. <br><br>  Today, the <a href="http://www.comfortway.com/technologies/">platform</a> works on a hybrid model - in a number of countries a direct connection to local operators has been implemented, and in part, services are provided on a roaming model with profile refilling in each country.  This is due solely to the ‚Äúgrowing pains‚Äù of the project - the technology has been implemented, and negotiations, integration and connection of new mobile operators - partners have not yet been completed.  In such a situation, some market experts have doubts about the performance of the implementation of Remote SIM provisioning by the company.  In this category was the respected Ilya Shatilin, who changed his mind after testing CwSim in several countries - <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3ab/d1c/9cb/3abd1c9cbdd14013b1330e20f3457a85.png"></div><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UkfnFb99O2M" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Previous publications by: <br>  ¬ª <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/evseyfaydo/topics/">Habrahabr</a> <br>  ¬ª <a href="https://geektimes.ru/users/evseyfaydo/topics/">Geektimes</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/398523/">https://habr.com/ru/post/398523/</a></p>
