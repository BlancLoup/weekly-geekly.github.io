  <section class="page js-page"><h1>FLOWMASTER: short</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In today's post, we decided to go directly to the description of the device itself, more precisely, all existing models at the moment.  We will try to identify the main characteristics and translate them into the user's language. <br><br>  So, let's start with the main question that many people who first hear about FLOWMASTER are asking: why is it needed at all?  Let's say right away: we cannot decide whether it is necessary to someone, our task is to tell about the parameters of the product and explain its advantages, of which there are, indeed, quite a few today. <br><br>  In a previous post, we wrote about the technology underlying the operation of the device - the WHDI technology.  Thanks to her, FLOWMASTER allows you to transmit video and audio over a distance through walls and obstacles without compression and signal delay.  The signal from the video source to the TV or projector is transmitted at radio frequencies.  For those who are worried about the quality of the product and the safety of its use, let us designate that FLOWMASTER has all the permits necessary for using the product in Russia (including the certificate of conformity).  The warranty on the product is 1 year.

      Main characteristics: <br>  - Range - up to 30 meters <br>  FLOWMASTER connects two devices at a distance and without wires.  The user can place the DVD player and TV at a distance from each other within the radius of action without being physically linked to each other. <br>  - FLOWMASTER provides communication of two devices not only at a distance, but also through obstacles and walls.  You can not just put the DVD player at a distance from the TV, but also place it in the next room or hide it in a bedside table. <br>  - FLOWMASTER supports video format up to 1920 * 1080p, 60fps.  Cinema fans can enjoy movies without losing quality. <br>  - Signal delay of less than 1 ms.  This allows you to freely play games (from your computer, Sony PlayStation 3, Xbox 360) on the big screen TV. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/669/86a/c30/66986ac308ddf71f85b4e36ed9649a88.png"><br><br>  The signal is transmitted using a transmitter (transmitter) and a receiver (receiver), they are connected to a signal source and a TV / projector, respectively.  Each FLOWMASTER kit has 1 transmitter and 1 receiver.  There are 3 models in the assortment, which differ from each other in the type and size of the transmitter. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7e0/838/655/7e08386550ebcd5687e52be639fec8c6.jpg"><br><br>  FLOWMASTER - the main model.  The transmitter of this model is connected to video sources with HDMI-connector, the transmitter is powered through a standard outlet.  The dimensions of the transmitter and receiver are the same.  Features of this model and its main differences from others - the largest range (within 30 meters), as well as the ability to flip the signal of the remote control video source.  Simply put, a user can control a DVD player, even if it is located in another room or hidden in a closet. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/692/f29/33d/692f2933d825381b75a1004325a7433c.jpg"><br><br>  mini FLOWMASTER.  The transmitter of this model has a compact size.  It is connected, like the previous model, to the HDMI connector of the video source, and is powered from the USB connector (no connection to the electrical outlet is necessary).  Optimal use of mini FLOWMASTER with a computer, laptop, tablet or smartphone.  The range of the device - 25 meters. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e86/b74/69f/e86b7469f3f1b565c0d752aa968b3245.jpg"><br><br>  Another model - FLOWMASTER for iPhone 4S.  As it is not difficult to guess, the transmitter is connected via a 30-pin connector to the above-mentioned device from Apple.  Power is provided by the built-in battery, moreover, in the updated version, the transmitter performs the function of an iPhone charger.  The range is 10 meters. <br><br>  In all models, the use of FLOWMASTER does not provide additional settings, the connection of the video source and the TV / projector is the same as when connecting a standard HDMI cable.  That's all for today.  In the following posts we will describe in more detail about the operation of each device. <br><br>  BE HIP!
