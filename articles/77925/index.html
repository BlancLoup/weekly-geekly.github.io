  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Iferta online shopping mall opened in Runet</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Web Systems LLC, which owns the WebCreds payment system, launched a new project, the online mall (shopping center) <a href="http://iferta.com/">iferta</a> , in which the products of various online stores are presented. <br><br>  <a href="http://iferta.com/">iferta</a> offers an affiliate program for stores.  A lot of money is invested in advertising the site and attracting customers. <br>  At the same time, the shops pay only a commission from a really perfect transaction - no subscription fee or payment for going to the store's website.  The size of the commission ranges from 2.5% to 15% depending on the price of a particular product, and is retained at the end of the month after the approval of sales reports. <br><br>  Besides the fact that the Internet mall is a profitable business for its owner, the company also achieves a synergy effect with it, indirectly developing its own payment system.

      By the way, the name of the mall iferta comes from two Spanish words ‚Äúoferta‚Äù (sentence) and ‚Äúferia‚Äù (fair).  The Latin letter "i" at the beginning, of course, taken from the word "internet". <br><br>  <b>About e-commerce market</b> <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  In the bourgeois, where there are much more diverse shops, shops and ‚Äústalls‚Äù than in Russia, the main trend of recent years is the appearance of shopping centers like iferta in the Network, which combine products from different suppliers, with easy navigation, search, catalogs.  This format allows you to quickly compare prices, choose from a larger range, buy everything you need at once, that is, significantly save time, effort and money. <br><br>  For Runet, Internet malls are a completely new phenomenon and, according to all experts, are very promising.  Especially given the fact that the market for online commerce in our country is growing by tens of percent per year.  According to iKS-Consulting, in 2008 the e-commerce market in Russia amounted to 196 billion rubles, showing an increase of 60%.  And despite the fact that online trade in 2008 accounted for only 1.4% of the total retail turnover in the country.  According to the forecast of iKS-Consulting, in 2009, despite the crisis, the Russian e-commerce market will grow by 30%. <br><br>  Western experience shows that the crisis has almost no effect on this market, since  on the web you can find cheaper goods.  According to a ComScore survey, Americans spent $ 15.3 billion in online stores from early November to December 4, which is 4% more than in the same period last year.  And according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), in the first quarter of 2009, revenues of the 80 largest US online stores increased by an average of 11%.  Amazon.com sales increased by 24%.  In other countries, the picture is similar - the revenue of the largest Internet auction and store of the company Alibaba Group in China in February exceeded last year‚Äôs figure by 131%. <br>  Analysts at Forrester predict that by 2014, the e-commerce market in Western Europe will be 123.1 billion euros, adding an average of 9.6% annually. <br>  The best-selling products in the US are consumer electronics and computers. <br>  PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) analyzed the preferences of Russian online shoppers in October of this year.  It turned out that at least once made a purchase on the Web 80% of the 2000 surveyed Internet users.  In Moscow, this figure reaches 87%. <br>  And, attention, we are not in vain called the most reading nation - the first place in the ranking of the popularity of products purchased on the Web is books (46%)! <br>  Also in RuNet, they actively buy household electronic equipment (40%), computers and software (35%), cosmetics and perfumery (31%) and other goods. <br>  The motivation of online shopaholics is quite obvious: 74% said that the main advantage is the ability to save time, 65% - the ability to receive goods for home delivery, 61% - the lack of fuss, typical of traditional stores.  In addition, 58% appreciate the convenience of purchasing goods 24/7, and 55% said they find products on the Web that are not offline. <br>  At the same time, according to iKS Consulting, 56% of Russian buyers pay cash to the courier, the share of electronic payment systems is 31%, and 11% of Russians pay with bank cards. <br><br>  <b>And a little more about iferta</b> <br><br>  Payment on the trading floor is provided with a bank card and, of course, an electronic wallet.  Delivery of goods is carried out directly by the store itself, in which the goods were ordered.  The iferta store monitors the performance of prepaid orders and guarantees the return of the prepayment to the customer‚Äôs wallet or bank card, in case the store has not fulfilled its obligations to deliver the goods. <br><br>  The development of the technical part of the project and the main functionality took about six months (February-August 2009).  Preparation for launch, development of an advertising campaign and connection of stores - about 3 months (autumn 2009).  It is expected that soon the monthly attendance of the portal will reach 100,000 users. <br><br>  PS: The details of the affiliate program will tell in the following publications. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/77925/">https://habr.com/ru/post/77925/</a></p>
