  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The goal is to attract customers</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Over the past 3-4 years I have not met a single task for the development of the site, in which there was no such goal.  It is worth noting that our specialization is the development of corporate sites.  Each company wants their website to become a tool to attract customers, but no company fully believes that this is possible.  They do not believe, because they cannot combine this goal with reality. <br><br>  It is easy to say: "We want to attract customers through the site."  But who are these potential customers?  Where are they?  What is important to them?  Why do they choose you?  What do they do on the Internet?  How do they get to the site? <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Stop.  Answers from the customer to the last two questions can not wait.  But the rest of the questions can not get answers if you do not directly ask the client.  Of course, the ideal customer will give you a comprehensive analysis of these issues along with the application for developing the site, but there are not many such customers, and they will go to your competitors.  A good website can be done without studying these issues, but why rely on luck if you can analyze it.

      The first step is to figure out what kind of product or service we end up ‚Äúselling‚Äù.  Better than the company operating in the market, no one will tell you about it.  So just ask the customer a few questions.  As a "product" are looking offline.  What pay attention to when choosing.  How the company is looking for customers offline - recommendations, advertising on TV and radio, advertising on the streets, telephone calls to potential customers, etc. What is the conversation with a potential buyer.  What they ask questions.  What the consultant tells and shows.  After this interview, you can create a good informational structure of the site, to understand what is important to place on the main page. <br><br>  You can go even further, find out in this area, ‚Äúexplore‚Äù the market (even according to customer stories), watch competitors, find significant differences (price, quality, service).  This will allow more competently to place accents, correctly pave the way through the site.  Ideally, we should take all the best from offline and correctly transfer it to the site.  And to add elements that are more difficult to organize in offlane, for example, getting feedback.  The main focus is on what is important to potential buyers. <br><br>  Now back to the two questions about which the customer can not advise you.  How will potential buyers get to the site?  Leaflets, business cards may contain the address of the site.  In advertising on TV and radio there may be a call to visit the company's website.  Website promotion, contextual and banner advertising can also lead visitors to the site.  There are still references to the site in blogs, forums, news resources and other sites.  All these sources lead visitors with different interests.  Analysis of the sources of attracting visitors to the site allows you to most effectively combine the goal of the site with reality. <br><br>  And what about the question: ‚ÄúWhat are potential buyers doing on the Internet?‚Äù.  For a start, I would expand it a bit: ‚ÄúWhat do potential buyers generally wonder about and where to look for them?‚Äù.  This is an important point, because it allows you to plan ways to attract potential buyers to the site.  If in Syzran nobody is looking for a lawyer in search engines, then there is no point in promoting the site in Yandex.  Sometimes this allows you to understand that the site will not allow you to achieve the goal set before it.  And then a goal adjustment is required. <br><br>  It turns out that I described the process of a preliminary analysis of the project, which precedes the design of the site.  And at the same time, this is my vision of how to make the section ‚ÄúGoals and Objectives‚Äù in the task of developing the site a basic one, and that all decisions made be based on this section. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/46638/">https://habr.com/ru/post/46638/</a></p>
