  <section class="page js-page"><h1>HTC is going to refuse to increase the capacity of batteries and QWERTy-keyboards</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  At the moment, HTC is one of the most sought-after manufacturers of mobile devices.  The other day, the creative director of this company announced a development strategy that HTC will follow in the near future.  Firstly, the company is fully going to abandon the use of full QWERTY-keyboards in the design of the device.  In addition, high-capacity batteries, which are thicker than conventional batteries, and, consequently, increase the thickness of smartphones, will also not be used. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  And thirdly, HTC is going to actively introduce Wi-Fi Display technology into its devices.  This solution allows you to easily transfer video and audio content to various displays in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãaccess of your mobile device.  Using this technology to connect to the Internet, to a local network or access point is not necessary.  Thus, a user of a device with a Wi-Fi Display can show a picture found on the Web or a web page to his colleagues / friends on a nearby TV. <br><br>  As for more capacious batteries than those used now, according to the management, the company refuses them, following the preferences of its customers.  Bier Kilburn, vice president of the company, said that HTC is not going to increase the capacity of the batteries used in their smartphones, as this leads to an increase in the size of mobile devices.  True, the same Motorola was able to create a model with a 3300 mAh battery, without increasing the thickness of the smartphone (this is a Razr Maxx model with a thickness of 8.9 mm).  After journalists reminded Kilburn of the Razr Maxx model, the vice president responded that the One X flagship uses a Super LCD display with reduced power consumption, and not AMOLED, which uses quite a lot of power, like the Razr Maxx, and therefore One X does not need a high capacity battery.

      HTC has conducted several studies in the framework of studying this issue, where it turned out that the portability of the device is more important for customers than the presence of a battery of increased capacity and, consequently, increased dimensions.  Buyers are more willing to take models with a thickness of 8-10 mm, and are less willing to purchase models with increased dimensions due to an increase in battery capacity.  Representatives of the company said that prototype models with batteries of increased capacity were bought reluctantly, since the thickness of such devices is greater than that of smartphones with batteries of average capacity. <br><br>  Regarding the rejection of QWERTY keyboards, it was said that more advanced displays with advanced feedback technology will be developed instead of them, and the company's customers will not be inconvenienced.  It was also said that the presence of a keyboard adversely affects the development of various model lines of HTC mobile devices.  It is likely that in a short time it will be possible to see the result of all these changes, although some elements are already apparent now in the new models of smartphones from HTC. <br><br>  Via <a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2403297,00.asp">pcmag</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/142477/">https://habr.com/ru/post/142477/</a></p>
