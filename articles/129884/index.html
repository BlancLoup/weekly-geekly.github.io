  <section class="page js-page"><h1>GTD for irrationals in practice</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><h4>  What am i talking about </h4><br>  This article, in itself, is the result of a short-term goal.  I want to talk a little about the methods used in the implementation process of managing time, mind and hands.  At once I will make a reservation that these methods do not exactly possess universality of the application, rather exclusiveness, but nevertheless, all of a sudden it is for you. <br><br>  In my life I have written quite a lot of different artistic stories, semi-technical articles and poems.  But like most of those authors who write for themselves, he published works for a modest audience of a few hundred people.  At the same time, there always was a feeling that the world would be much better if I did not read 200, but, for example, 200,000 people.  The goal is quite clear and articulated.  Moreover, in order to see the proven path to achieve it, built by others and for centuries, one does not have to be a rocket scientist.  And so the task ‚ÄúWrite an article on Habrahabr‚Äù appeared.  It was in this form that the task formulated, without any specific topic, materials or deadlines, hung for several months on my list of unsorted tasks. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Task list </h4><br>  Since I mentioned the task list (hereinafter tudushka, may the Gods forgive my sentimentality), I‚Äôll tell you a little about how it works for me.  In the mood for the mood, I bought several applications in the App Store for planning time, for managing my projects, for any individual business-productivity benchmarking, and similar software.  Buying apps gives me pleasure from the buying process itself, but I really use <b>iCal</b> as a meeting schedule and <b>elementary list</b> without parameters for <b>all</b> other tasks.  Tasks have no deadlines, priorities, and even more so categories or projects.  Before I bought a MacBook, I generally used white A4 sheets, on which I wrote tasks with a pen, diluting them with drawings in the margins.  The main method: the thought came - I wrote it down in a tudushka.

    <h4>  Irrationals </h4><br>  Surely, the one written above has already seemed to you offtopic in the GTD blog topic, or, worse, a slob heresy.  The problem is that this slob is extremely successful at work, happy in family life and knows how to ‚ÄúGet his Things Done‚Äù.  I‚Äôve probably read about a dozen books on self-management with the aim to find some interesting methods, and even found and use something like that, but the main thing (I‚Äôll repeat it for many, because the truth doesn‚Äôt tarnish) . <br><br>  Recently, the GTD blog has been posting <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/gtd/123728/">with links to articles</a> about who are irrationals and how to live.  The articles are very good, so I will not repeat.  There everything is laid out on the shelves, and my topic is rather a small addition, confirmation and success story. <br><br>  Now I will finish and I will continue to work on the calculation of the production of oil-extracting equipment, and maybe I will go to apply for a new visa to Europe, and maybe I will go home and cut a hookah.  I do not know what I will do in half an hour, and I don‚Äôt want to know! <br><br><h4>  A couple of principles </h4><br><ul><li>  If you are stupid for more than five minutes, switching from a bookmark to a bookmark in the browser and pressing <s>F5</s> Cmd + R on Twitter, open the above tudo, click on any random task and start doing.  Your subconscious mind remembers the entire list.  Moreover, it still remembers all your emotional experiences accumulated for each task from the moment you wrote it down, so do not hesitate; the finger will be sent to the right point by it. <br></li><li>  Do not be afraid that the "blood from the nose by Monday" calculation of production will not be completed in time and you nadaad ass.  When on Friday evening you suddenly want to work on this calculation on the eve of Monday‚Äôs scheduling, the efficiency will be so high that in 4-6 hours work, which was allotted a whole week, will be completed.  But imagine how much of everything else you can manage to do this week.  Never be afraid that some important tasks will remain put in the box and burn.  Although this goes against almost all working time planning policies, this method also has the right to live for a successful person. <br></li><li>  Do not be afraid to forget something.  Just write down in the calendar of the meeting and actions attached to the time (by the way, just such obvious things are usually written in smart books).  During the day, it‚Äôs better not to look at the calendar, as the upcoming events will only fade more often in the head than necessary.  When the time comes, the calendar bibikalka will let you know. <br></li><li>  Have fun in the short term.  Less often bother about what you get as a result of some activity, and often enjoy the process.  You like to program in PHP, roller-skate, go camping and count the production of oil-producing equipment. <br></li><li>  Realize that there are people and "others."  It is worth respecting their internal structure.  For comparison, I will tell you that, for example, my wife's motivation is very tied to the medium term.  So, after graduating from university and having worked, she realized that in this country she could not adequately express herself.  As a result, of course, fell into depression, and no momentary joys were not good.  But, as soon as I approved a specific decision to move to the United States in the next two years, in order to have a child (which is already time) with their citizenship, the mood of the spouse immediately changed.  Having a child in the United States is an example of a medium-term perspective, for which she must quickly defend her dissertation, and prepare for the American license examinations.  And she likes to do it.  I will ask in advance in the comments not to give me advice on having children and not to discuss my personal life.  This is just a clear example. <br></li></ul><br>  I think that by pressing the ‚ÄúPublish‚Äù button, it will be possible to consider the short-term goal achieved and move on ... what was I going to do there ...? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/129884/">https://habr.com/ru/post/129884/</a></p>
