  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Why am I not using a mobile phone?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I do not use a mobile phone.  All friends are so surprised when they hear it.  How?  You do not have mobile?  You do not need it?  And how is this even possible? <br>  But it is possible. <br>  I hate these things for many reasons, and now I will try to list these reasons. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  First, the standard ringtones in the phones are extremely vile and squeak unbearably.  Well, you can, of course, stuff an mp3 file into the phone.  As I recently went out to the balcony, and there are beer ‚Äúreal boys‚Äù under the window, and here one of them gets the phone and starts sorting through the melodies, as if emphasizing its ‚Äúreality‚Äù and ‚Äúprecision‚Äù: first the melody from the ‚ÄúBrigade‚Äù, then - ‚ÄúBoomer‚Äù, ‚ÄúMurka‚Äù and then (a gesture full of drama) a parody melody from the movie ‚ÄúGentlemen of Luck‚Äù - apparently from despair and because the melodies ended.  But a special abomination is also in the fact that these mp3-files are played in a terrible quality, but for me, a turned-up music lover and an audiophile, this is like a crap over my heart. <br>  In general, sounds can not produce mobile phones. <br><br>  Secondly, craziphones prevent me from communicating normally.  It's terrible when a person at the end of the wire is barely audible, and you have to ask again a hundred times.  It's terrible when you get people you don't want to hear.  And the sms format is absolutely communication for imbicils: <br>  - Hi what are you doing? <br>  - Hi, I listen to music, and you? <br>  - And I am preparing for exams. <br>  - I see.  Love you! <br>  - And I love you! <br>  Communication, aha.  Dilution of the brain to the state of birch sap, that's what it is.

      Thirdly, the mobile phone has always been for me a kind of talisman of philistinism.  Even when they were a rarity, only a few (along with a gold chain around their neck and a black jeep: pure kitsch could afford them), and then few owners wore phones on their belts, proudly showing this property to the public.  Even in summer, on the beach, they clung to a plastic freak in a leather wrap for swimming trunks.  Further - more, the youth got phones;  Covers with the image of hemp, obscene screensavers for small screens came into fashion.  Then - ‚Äúsend sms to such a number and check your compatibility with the boyfriend / get a horoscope / upload funny pictures and so on‚Äù. <br>  Do a simple experiment.  You are sitting with friends in a cafe, you have five people.  Get your phone and twist in your hands, press the buttons.  The other four will do the same immediately.  It doesn't matter who your friends are - schoolchildren, vocational schools or cool IT specialists (in this case they have an expensive iPhone, but they still get it and start to poke pointlessly) <br><br>  Yes, damn it, even when a gopnik takes away someone's phone on the street - this is not robbery, this is a religious rite, the seizure of a cow, the transfer of a blessed icon, +1 ppyak or whatever.  Otherwise, he would not have taken the phone for a hundred dollars, but a jacket for two thousand, but would have taken away a wallet with as many more. <br><br>  Fourth, I hate to depend on something.  And try to deprive a person of his favorite phone for a day!  He will be as without hands, start to rush, panic.  Yes, everyone knows that.  I suppose it all went through.  Thank God, my work and my life allow me the luxury of not having a phone: I communicate with customers and friends on ICQ, and if I‚Äôm not online, it‚Äôs unavailable.  Do not bother me with your impatience: with myself I am often more pleasant to communicate than with any Anya M., which I do not remember at all, and to the questions of which you usually answer ‚Äúhello, normal, I work‚Äù, as at Bashorge. <br><br>  Here, I remembered an excellent example of a mobile petty bourgeois: a certain hip-hop Battle ‚ÄúGlamor BG Battle # 1‚Äù was held (the battle of the coolest MCs, everything), and the prize for the first place was 500 rubles for a mobile phone. <br>  Okay, I'm not trying to convince anyone of anything.  I'm just thinking, do not take it seriously :) <br>  But why people are worn with their mobile phones like that - for the life of me, I don‚Äôt understand. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/27927/">https://habr.com/ru/post/27927/</a></p>
