I bring to your attention my personal experience of living and working in Denmark, the Scandinavian country of the Vikings. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Comment </h4>  Everything is described below - only personal impressions and in no way claims to be the ultimate truth.  This is not agitation, but only a statement of facts as well as positive and negative points. <br><br><h4>  About myself </h4>  Born and raised in Kiev, Ukraine.  I have been living in <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps%3Ff%3Dq%26source%3Ds_q%26hl%3Den%26geocode%3D%26q%3DCopenhagen,%2BDenmark%26sll%3D37.0625,-95.677068%26sspn%3D54.005807,113.90625%26ie%3DUTF8%26ll%3D55.678552,12.568016%26spn%3D18.944708,56.953125%26t%3Dh%26z%3D5">Copenhagen</a> , Denmark for over 6 years, I work as a programmer in C # at a branch of a large American company.  Before moving he graduated from Kiev Polytechnic University, worked as a sysadmin, web programmer (PHP, MySQL ...) and just a programmer (Delphi, C #). <br><br><h4>  Why Denmark? </h4>  By chance.  I was looking for an option to go abroad, because  in Ukraine at that time (2002-2003) there was little interesting and well-paid work for programmers.  Turned up the chance to leave under the contract for an internship in Denmark for 1 year with the possibility of extension.  The selection was not very strict - tests on C # and English.  In my case, the internship turned out to be paid as a student, and the work had to be done the same as the rest.  After the end of the contract, I thought of going to the States or England, but here I was offered to stay and move to the usual full time position in the same company, which I took advantage of.  Now I see that it was possible to immediately find a normal position and not waste 1 year in vain.

    <h4>  about country </h4><img alt="Danish flag" hspace="10" vspace="10" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/827/645/d3d/827645d3df6e03dc9e5c434256765fa5.png"><br>  Denmark is a country in Northern Europe on the shores of the Baltic and North Seas, occupies the Jutland peninsula to the north of Germany and several islands, the main of which are Zeeland and Funen.  The population is about 5.5 million, the language is Danish, most people understand and speak good English. <br>  The climate is temperate, it is not hot in summer, about 20-25 warm, in winter about 0. You can swim 2-3 weeks a year, mostly in August, if the water has time to warm up to acceptable temperatures.  The sea wind is constantly blowing, so you can catch a cold even in the summer with unaccustomed use. <br>  Currency - Danish kroner (DKK), the rate is strictly tied to the euro at the moment.  Course 1 EUR = 7.57 DKK. <br>  Danes often lead in ratings on the happiest people on earth.  Perhaps this contributes to a short working week (37 hours), long paid vacations (5-6 weeks), strong social security, confidence in the future and good ecology. <br>  Denmark is famous for Vikings, beer Karlsberg and Tuborg, storyteller Andersen, <a href="http://www.denmark.dk/en/menu/About-Denmark/Arts-Culture/Danish-Design-Architecture/Danish-Design-Architecture.htm">Danish design</a> , a high standard of living and concern for the environment. <br>  You can read more about Denmark in <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2594%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F">Wikipedia</a> and on <a href="http://www.denmark.dk/en">denmark.dk</a> . <br><br><h4>  Job </h4>  Anyone who does not have a passport from one of the European Union countries can get permission to work in Denmark in one of the following cases: <br>  - the profession is in the so-called <a href="http://www.nyidanmark.dk/en-us/coming_to_dk/work/positivelist/">‚Äúpositive list‚Äù</a> .  Despite the fact that the list changes regularly, ‚ÄúIT and telecommunication‚Äù has been there for quite a long time.  Please note that you need to first find a job, and only then apply for a visa. <br>  - you were offered a vacancy with a minimum payment of DKK 375,000 (50,000 EUR) per year (before taxes).  This is the average salary in Denmark, in the IT field it is offered even to beginners, so getting it will not be a problem for a professional. <br>  - <a href="http://www.nyidanmark.dk/en-us/coming_to_dk/work/greencard-scheme/greencard-scheme.htm">Green Card</a> , an option for those who want to look for work while in Denmark.  This is a new program that was opened last year.  I still do not know a single person who would use it. <br><br>  You can search for work on the following sites (most of them in Danish, <a href="http://translate.google.com/translate_t%3Fhl%3Den%26sl%3Dda%26tl%3Den">Google Translate</a> to help you): <br>  <a href="http://www.jobzonen.dk/">http://www.jobzonen.dk</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.jobindex.dk/">http://www.jobindex.dk</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.job-support.dk/">http://www.job-support.dk</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.dk-jobs.dk/">http://www.dk-jobs.dk</a> <br><br>  The working atmosphere is very different from the one that exists in the former USSR.  The working day is usually from 9 to 17, with a lunch break.  Many companies feed staff for free or for a minimal payment, pay insurance, make additional payments to the pension fund, provide bonuses in the form of free home Internet, mobile phone, etc., if necessary.  The relationship of superiors with subordinates is closer to informal.  Personally, at first it was very unusual for me that everyone calls each other only by name (by the way, there is no such thing as a middle name in Denmark, only a first and last name), even if a person holds a position higher than yours or much older than you.  Danes work very slowly, often take breaks, drink coffee and discuss topics that are not related to work. <br><br><h4>  A crisis </h4>  Before the crisis, the work was full, unemployment fell to a record 1.5%. As of April 2009, the number of unemployed rose to 3.5% and continues to increase.  Banking, construction, and real estate were particularly hard hit.  Some foreign companies have curtailed or reduced their branches in Denmark.  Many IT companies also responded to the crisis, stopping the recruitment of personnel. <br><br><h4>  Finance: taxes, expenses, prices </h4><img alt="Danish crowns" hspace="10" vspace="10" src="http://img246.imageshack.us/img246/1026/9906874665c1d3a2a4b.jpg"><br>  In Denmark, it makes no sense to go for super-high incomes, but it is quite possible to count on Taxes in 2008 were the highest in the world, an average of <a href="http://www.thelocal.se/10402/20080311/">48.4%</a> goes to the state.  Tax floating, the more you earn, the more tax.  This year, the parliament is planning to adopt a series of laws that should slightly reduce the tax burden.  Prices for goods and services are high, affecting 25% VAT. <br>  Upon receipt of a work contract, the salary is usually not discussed, well, except maybe just a little.  Most salaries are tied to tariff schedules, which take into account position, work experience, etc.  For young professionals, one can expect that after taxes, 18,000 DKK (2,400 EUR) will remain.  For more experienced - 25,000 (3,300 EUR) and higher.  Such a salary is enough for a family of 2 adults and 1 child, even stays on entertainment and vacation.  If both parents work, then in general there are no problems with finances.  In some cases, you can deduct part of the money from taxes, for example, if you give a bank loan, if your spouse does not work or if you travel a long distance every day. <br>  Average costs for 1 month: <br>  * rent 2-room apartment: DKK 6,000 - 7,000 (790 - 920 EUR), additionally water, electricity and gas in the amount of about DKK 1,000 (130 EUR) <br>  * transport: depends on the distance, the monthly travel average DKK 600 (80 EUR) <br>  * Meals: DKK 2,000 - 3,000 (260 - 400 EUR) per person, fresh vegetables / fruits all year round, surprisingly expensive fish.  Food costs are greatly reduced if fed at work <br>  * Cellular: usually DKK 200 (25 EUR), anlim DKK 450 (60 EUR) <br>  * Internet: DKK 150 for 2 Mbps, DKK 300 for 20 Mbps anlim (20 - 40 EUR), available everywhere <br>  * car: expensive as the car itself, and insurance and gasoline, prices vary greatly depending on the condition of the car, and on insurance - from a confirmed driving experience <br>  * taxi: expensive, on average DKK 200 (25 EUR) per trip, on weekends and at night more expensive <br>  * cigarettes: minimum DKK 35 per pack (4.5 EUR) <br>  * alcohol: minimum DKK 80 (10.5 EUR) <br><br>  Paradox: the prices of products in Denmark are the same, and often even lower than in Ukraine.  Stores each week declare discounts on certain types of goods, and not like we have 3-5%, and all 30 or even 50%. <br>  Twice a year, in January and August, in all stores mass sales begin, during which you can buy everything you need for half the price.  Very common are online purchases.  You can freely order products from any European online stores where prices are lower than Danish, and the choice is greater. <br><br><h4>  Girls </h4><img alt="Danish girls" hspace="10" vspace="10" src="http://img528.imageshack.us/img528/1710/danskpigeresize.jpg"><br>  There are a lot of tall, blue-eyed blondes among Danish women, most of the girls are slender with a beautiful face.  Almost do not use cosmetics and take little care of themselves (on the streets you can instantly calculate the tourists on the abundance of cosmetics on the face).  As a result, after 30-35 years, beauty gradually fades away. <br>  Danes are very emancipated, have long fought for the same rights as men.  As a result, the character of the girls became similar to men, and men - to girls.  In no case do not offer Danish help until she asks for you (and she will never do that!).  The offer to help is often viewed as an insult - I am a girl and I can do everything myself!  On the street you can often see a situation where a guy goes light, and his companion pulls a pair of heavy bags or a suitcase. <br>  In Denmark, it is not necessary to register a marriage, you can just live together.  In this case, the couple has the same rights, as if officially registered their relationship.  Because of this, couples more often converge and diverge, often there are families in which 3-4 children, each of which has different parents. <br>  For lovers of the exotic - same-sex marriage is allowed, moreover, recently such couples were allowed to adopt children.  : / <br><br><h4>  A life </h4><img alt="Copenhagen Center" hspace="10" vspace="10" src="http://img217.imageshack.us/img217/5212/nyhavncopenhagenresize.jpg"><br>  Life is very calm and measured.  They are in no hurry and like to plan everything in advance.  Do not be surprised if you are invited for Christmas (December 24) in April or May.  Most small shops are closed on weekends, grocery supermarkets are open on Saturdays until 5:00 pm.  The selection in the stores is surprisingly very limited, there is little variety.  Some of the things we are familiar with are missing altogether (buckwheat, cottage cheese) or have a completely unexpected taste (for example, sweet herring, sweet ‚Äúpickles‚Äù).  If you wish, you can find familiar products in Russian, Polish or German stores. <br>  The Danes are friendly and helpful.  Attitude towards immigrants from Eastern Europe is normal, those who are older, taught Russian at school and sometimes try to remember a few phrases.  Almost all Danes speak English fluently, but it‚Äôs still difficult without the Danish language.  Also, knowledge of the language is necessary for obtaining a permanent residence permit (after 7 years) and citizenship (after 9 years).  Studying Danish is free for the first 3 years after arrival in the country.  The entire basic course of study (5 modules) can be completed in 1 year if desired, and there is a tendency towards languages, in reality, 2 years.  The language has little in common with German, but the pronunciation is very difficult.  It‚Äôs almost impossible to speak Danish without an accent if you haven‚Äôt taught him since childhood.  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DhQE4YKu6WC0">Here is an example of</a> how the Danish language sounds. <br>  All land in Denmark is privately owned, so wildlife, as in our countries, is not here.  Of course, there are huge parks in which you can meet many different animals in freedom, but the park will be fenced and groomed, everywhere there will be trashcans disguised as the environment, and you can only put up a tent and make a fire in places specifically designed for this. <br>  In Denmark, the bureaucracy is reduced to a minimum, almost everything can be done via the Internet.  Free internet is available in libraries for all comers. <br><img alt="Bicycle parking" hspace="10" vspace="10" src="http://img246.imageshack.us/img246/8202/denmark2125resize.jpg"><br>  The most common form of transport is a bicycle.  Cyclists have an advantage over cars, special tracks are everywhere marked for them and free parking is organized.  Everyone rides bicycles, including pregnant women in recent months and top managers in business suits, all year round in rain and snow. <br>  Crime is small, basically it is theft of someone else's bikes, which owners forget to lock.  We can say that this is a hobby for the Danes :) For all the time in Denmark, I came across a crime only once, when the door was broken in the car and the radio tape recorder was stolen.  At night, you can safely return home.  Locals say the crime rate jumped after the recent adoption of Eastern countries in the EU, such as Poland.  There are practically no homeless people, I haven‚Äôt met with drug addicts either, although I read that the government gives them drugs for free so that they do not break the law, trying to find money for another injection. <br>  In Denmark there are no orphanages, on the contrary - huge queues for the adoption of children from other countries.  Sometimes you can see families with several children, one of whom has a different skin color (it is immediately clear that he was adopted). <br>  Free tuition is available to anyone who has worked in Denmark for at least 2 years, even paying a small stipend.  The school year begins on August 15 and ends at the end of June.  You can earn money, but not more than 15 hours a week.  If you can earn money for this time more than a certain amount, then you can take a scholarship. <br>  It's all the same what you're wearing.  You can freely wear crumpled, old and torn things, no one will lead with an eye.  In most stores, clothes are sold in dull dark colors, so if you meet a well-dressed person outside, it‚Äôs most likely a foreigner.  For our girls, the first impressions of the fashionable fashion are especially negative; they have to get used to the Danish fashion for a long time. <br>  Many Danes go in for sports.  The most popular types (except for cycling, of course) are handball, football and running.  You can often see an old woman, under 70 years old, running past at a brisk pace, or a group of cyclists in full sports equipment, riding fast on some futuristic sports bikes. <br>  Medicine leaves a double impression.  On the one hand, free, modern hospitals, subsidies for drugs, etc., on the other hand, local doctors are often not competent enough (they have to contact them first when they are sick), do not want to be referred to specialists for treatment.  It turns out that if something serious happens - they are cured, and if a trifle or something non-lethal - they can say that it will heal itself. <br><br><h4>  Ecology </h4><img alt="Wind generators" hspace="10" vspace="10" src="http://neatorama.cachefly.net/images/2008-01/middelgrunden-wind-farm-denmark.jpg"><br>  Danes are ecologically obsessed.  This is reflected in the categorization of garbage, the widespread construction of wind generators, the availability of special ‚Äúenvironmentally friendly‚Äù (and expensive) products in the stores, along with the ‚Äúusual‚Äù ones, as well as the ongoing debate on how Denmark can affect global warming.  Any more or less well-known Danish company in Denmark has at least a couple of programs to support the environment.  Add to this the ubiquitous spread of bicycles, the high cost of cars (evil tongues say that the Danes are forced to pedal because of the high prices of cars) and the constant breeze - as a result we get clean and fresh air all year round. <br><img alt="Danish ducks" hspace="10" vspace="10" src="http://img246.imageshack.us/img246/6375/picture488resize.jpg"><br>  There are many ducks, swans and other waterfowl birds in Denmark, they are not afraid of people - on the contrary, they swim to meet them, climb to the shore and surround you, demanding food :) Some birds are marked and then they follow the migration routes. <br><br><h4>  Total </h4><img alt="Evening sky" hspace="10" vspace="10" src="http://img246.imageshack.us/img246/6441/picture003resize.jpg"><br>  As in any country, there are pros and cons.  Personally, I like Denmark, and when I get bored, there is always an opportunity to travel or go home.  But what is surprising, in a couple of days in Kiev I want to go back to where there is clean air, friendly people and a quiet life. <br><br>  It seems to me that the question ‚Äúto go or not to go‚Äù is very similar to the scene from the movie ‚ÄúThe Matrix‚Äù, in which Morpheus offers the main character Neo two tablets - blue and red. <br><img title="Frame from the film &quot;The Matrix&quot;" hspace="10" vspace="10" src="http://img34.imageshack.us/img34/5338/0thematrixredbluepillth.jpg"><br>  Having taken the blue pill, the hero will wake up in his bed in the morning and forget everything that happened to him.  By accepting the red one, he will know the truth and get answers to his questions.  For those who still decided or is going to try the red pill, I can help with tips and answers to questions. <br><br>  <b>UPD:</b> Thanks for the karma, the topic has been moved to the ‚ÄúI Migrate‚Äù blog. <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/59942/">https://habr.com/ru/post/59942/</a></p>
