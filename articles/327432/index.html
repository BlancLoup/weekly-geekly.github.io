Given these day-to-day tasks, it is often difficult for managers to determine which projects or types of production activities need to be given special attention, calculate the remainder of the budget, understand how effectively resources are used and how to plan work in order to keep up with demand. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5bd/1cb/66c/5bd1cb66c98e4d799984daca9c021197.png" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Problematics</b> <br><br>  The main task is to provide a high-tech solution of the corporate level, which should ensure the unification, integrity and integration of the development, implementation, replication and maintenance of information systems.  This is due to the fact that from the point of view of managing a portfolio / program of projects (releases), a single scheduling is not enough.  A life cycle automation system is needed, which will allow to identify / ‚Äúfix‚Äù and reuse the following main entities:

      ‚Ä¢ The life cycle of projects of various types, including major milestones and artifacts (document templates); <br>  ‚Ä¢ Key parameters of the ‚Äúhealth‚Äù of the project / program / portfolio with the possibility of automatic calculation; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Lifecycle of problem management (a separate life cycle for each type) arising in the project, with the possibility of automatic escalation along a certain management vertical; <br>  ‚Ä¢ The life cycle of the project framework change management with the possibility of automatic escalation along a certain management vertical; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Summary reporting on the state of the portfolio / program / project in real time, accessible to users based on roles and security policies (role-based access). <br><br>  All the above problems are solved at the level of specialized information systems of the class Project Portfolio Management (PPM). <br><br>  <b>Functional purpose of the HPE Project Portfolio Management Center</b> <br><br>  The HPE Project Portfolio Management (HPE PPM) software is a platform for automating key processes for managing project portfolios, programs and individual projects in large organizations in the face of tight time, resource and financial constraints. <br><br>  The concept of the portfolio management process is presented in the diagram below: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f63/682/942/f6368294219e4831a312c8644b0b7da7.JPG" alt="image"><br><br>  The portfolio management system is designed to solve the following tasks: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Automation of the organization‚Äôs portfolio management process: collection of project initiatives, their ranking, linking to the organization‚Äôs business goals, alignment of business cases, portfolio ‚Äúalignment‚Äù according to the available budget and resources, taking into account current project and operational activities; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Automation of the process of managing the project activities of the organization: the formation of portfolios, programs, projects;  project resource management;  monitoring key performance indicators (KPIs) in the implementation of projects / programs;  formation and delivery of management reports on the project activities of the organization in real time. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Automation of the resource management process: the creation and maintenance of resource pools;  maintenance of resource qualification directories;  individual resource calendars;  support for the allocation of resources for projects;  working time accounting subsystem (both project and operating activities). <br><br>  The HPE PPM system is modular and supports the implementation of portfolio management processes in organizations both ‚Äútop-down‚Äù and ‚Äúbottom-up‚Äù.  The implementation of individual functions is also supported - management of programs / projects, resources;  project proposals, etc., with the subsequent expansion of the functional and the scope of related functions and processes. <br><br>  The main feature of the HPE PPM solution is the possibility of flexible configuration of the system objects to fully comply with the tasks set.  Each HPE PPM object has its own attributes, workflow, and life cycle (LC).  Thanks to these capabilities, a clear organization of the work process and interaction of all participants is achieved, as well as the implementation and control of any performance / efficiency parameters within the process. <br><br>  HPE PPM software solves the following tasks: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Visually analyze and prioritize strategic and operational requirements and requests, form projects and tasks based on them, allocating resources, calculating time costs and determining the degree of their influence on the implementation of the organization's strategy; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Provide managers with a single ‚Äúentry point‚Äù and ‚Äúcoordinate system‚Äù for making decisions regarding projects and needs, allowing them to be analyzed and ranked in terms of their impact on the organization‚Äôs strategic activities; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Provide top-down planning and data collection to elaborate plans and monitor progress on all required bottom-up indicators; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Quickly adapt to changes and ensure that the company's business processes and projects comply with their strategic and operational goals; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Effectively distribute the burden on the organization‚Äôs employees, which in turn allows paying maximum attention to the highest priority tasks, as well as clearly understanding the current resource load and planning future needs; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Visually monitor in real time the status of projects, including important ‚Äúsupporting‚Äù processes, such as: <br>  o change management <br>  o project management <br>  o risk management <br>  o management of orders <br>  o and others. <br><br>  <b>HPE PPM Solution Brief</b> <br><br>  Technically, the HPE PPM solution is a software ‚ÄúBPM engine‚Äù that allows flexible customization of business processes for managing project initiatives / projects / programs / portfolios, as well as content management and coordination mechanisms.  For ease of use of the solution, users are provided with a custom portal with visualizations of aggregated data using modern technologies and a flexible interface that displays all the necessary information in accordance with the role-based model of the organization. <br><br>  Conceptually, the HPE PPM automates the project methodology and allows embedding test points in the life cycle of projects / programs / portfolios at the strategic management level.  At a lower level of planning and managing individual work in a project, Microsoft Project can be used.  HPE provides a fully integrated, regular data synchronization module between the HPE PPM and Microsoft Project.  The synchronization module supports three possible data transfer scenarios: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ HPE PPM acts as a master system for managing the project plan, and Microsoft Project is used as an auxiliary solution; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Microsoft Project acts as a master system, and HPE PPM is used as an auxiliary solution from the point of view of maintaining project plans, but as a master system for monitoring KPI of projects / programs / portfolios; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Equitable scenario. <br><br>  Such an approach allows flexible integration of strategic planning and management based on HPE PPM and tactical project management based on the Microsoft Project, while eliminating the need for other supporting tools. <br><br>  The advanced technological mechanisms of HPE PPM allow you to create workflows in the BPM standard, which provide a clear framework and controllability of the project movement in phases, starting from the description phase of the template solution (requirements management), and up to readiness for circulation and direct replication.  Each stage of the life cycle (key milestones) are assigned criteria that define a satisfactory / unsatisfactory state - the performance of certain tasks / procedures, the availability of documents and approvals.  These criteria are monitored by the system, and their satisfaction / dissatisfaction affects the key performance / health indicators (KPIs) of the project / program / portfolio as a whole. <br><br>  HPE PPM allows you to customize flexible relationships between different entities, such as tasks, assignments, projects, etc. A convenient mechanism for setting up these relationships allows you to create complex interaction scenarios at the levels of project-task, task-task, task-project, project-program etc. All these opportunities maximally cover the organization‚Äôs needs in project management. <br><br>  The solution also automates workflows for the following critical aspects of project management: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Change management; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Project management; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Management of risks; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Management of orders; <br>  ‚Ä¢ etc. <br><br>  For each of these entities, a reconciliation / escalation / decision-making procedure is defined, and it can be supported by the time constraints of being at each step.  It is possible to categorize requests by type and link individual workflows for specific types of requests.  A flexible role model is maintained that can satisfy organizations of the highest degree of complexity and distribution. <br><br>  A key feature of the HPE PPM is the built-in matching mechanism, which is able to implement the logic of any level of complexity.  In this case, if it is necessary to initiate the approval process in the external system, the HPE PPM provides such an opportunity. <br><br>  The solution architecture contains ready-made integration mechanisms with the document management system (Documentum), which allows you to use external workflow processes in conjunction with the project activity and automatically monitor the statuses of documents participating in the project life cycle. <br><br>  Additional integration capabilities that HPE PPM has are integration with the ITSM class solution (HPE Service Manager) and the ALM class product (HPE Quality Center). <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ The ITSM class solution is a platform for automating key IT processes and, in conjunction with HPE PPM, allows building a mechanism for interaction and data transfer for such a key process as change management (changes in infrastructure, development of an IMS, introduction of new software in the process of project implementation). <br>  ‚Ä¢ The ALM class solution is a platform for automating the life cycle of software development and, in conjunction with HPE PPM, allows building a holistic process of implementing changes and release management in software products. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/419/539/3d9/4195393d9d0c4f75b955d92d9cd6076b.JPG" alt="image"><br><br>  Integration with human resources accounting and accounting systems (SAP), specialized software life cycle management systems (SAP Solution Manager) and other business and IT systems is also possible using standard web services mechanisms. <br><br>  In terms of reporting, HPE PPM has built-in capabilities for visualizing key control parameters for all roles involved in project activities: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ TOP management of the company; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Management of business units; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Management of the project office; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Project managers; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Ordinary performers. <br><br>  Reporting is implemented using control panels, which display statistics in graphical form (diagrams, "traffic lights", "speedometers", etc.).  The control panels can be easily configured by the users themselves from the set of available templates.  The reporting fully supports the role model and the security model, and the user gets access only to the data that is available to him depending on the role being played. <br><br>  <b>HPE PPM specifications</b> <br><br>  HPE PPM solution is built on a three-tier architecture and has a developed web client as a user interface. <br><br>  Integration with any external systems supporting web services technology is possible.  There is a proven practice of integration with SAP, Microsoft Project Server, Documentum. <br><br>  HPE PPM has proven itself in the largest geographically distributed organizations with a total number of employees of up to several hundred thousand people.  There are deployments in which the number of daily simultaneous connections exceeds 5,000 users. <br><br>  System development within an organization implies both consistent vertical scaling within the IT department in terms of the scope of portfolio management and resource management processes, and horizontal scaling in terms of the scope of portfolio management of both IT and non-IT projects and programs within the organization. <br><br>  The licensing of the HPE PPM system has recently undergone significant changes in the direction of simplification.  Today we can say that from the point of view of the cost of ownership, it has moved into the class of mid-budget systems, possessing, nevertheless, the most complete and developed functionality. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/327432/">https://habr.com/ru/post/327432/</a></p>
