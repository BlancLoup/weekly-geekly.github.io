  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Fujitsu U1010 UMPC Overview</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> Having passed about a year with a powerful Fujitsu-Siemens N560 PDA, I began to think about buying a UMPC.  For a long time I have been eyeing the Sony and Samsung models with a full keyboard.  Having turned in the hands of the Samsung Q1 Ultra and Sony UX series, I realized that this is not exactly what I want.  One autumn morning, reading news feeds, I came across interesting news: Fujitsu announced the start of sales of new UMPC - Fujitsu U1010.  Joy was not a chapel, it was exactly what I wanted: a large touch-screen, a full QWERTY-keyboard, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and much more. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  A couple of weeks later, I was sitting in the cabin of an IL-86 aircraft operating a flight Moscow-Bangkok.  On the second day of my trip, I visited the Pantip Plaza shopping center, a clone of the Savelovsky market, only five floors above.  The first thing that caught my eye was the insane amount of Asus EEE PC and its price, approximately 10,000 rubles.  Fujitsu U1010 in the black case was not easy to find, but my searches were crowned with success.  In addition to the computer, I purchased another thin LG DVD drive.  The entire purchase cost me about $ 1100, a hundred of which I gave for the drive.  As a gift, the Thai man handed me a leather case for UMPC, cost about $ 30.

     <a href="http://imgshare.ru/v.php%3Fid%3D24f89a5da727cf1d9449b07faec29277.jpg"><img src="http://imgshare.ru/thumbs/24f89a5da727cf1d9449b07faec29277.jpg"></a> <br><br>  The box with the Fujitsu U1010 in size resembles the box from the Fujitsu-Siemens N560, which has become a native PDA.  Inside it is divided into two parts: the top one is a foam plastic box in which the computer itself is located, and the bottom one is a cardboard box.  I will tell about its contents in more detail.  Most of the space in the box is occupied by various pieces of paper - instructions, descriptions, notebook accessories, as well as driver discs, two pieces of Recovery DVD, Acronis True Image 10.0 disk and Norman Virus Control key valid for a year.  In addition, the box contains a special adapter that allows you to connect an external monitor and LAN to the UMPC, charging, a cloth for wiping the screen and a rag case that is extremely unpleasant to the touch.  This case, of course, will save from scratches, but, I believe that it is better not to save and buy a normal leather case with protective inserts. <br><br> <a href="http://imgshare.ru/v.php%3Fid%3Db141b23ae0440da6f62c2cd9ac0ee39b.jpg"><img src="http://imgshare.ru/thumbs/b141b23ae0440da6f62c2cd9ac0ee39b.jpg"></a> <br><br>  The case of the UMPC is made of soft-touch plastic, on which no fingerprints remain.  Never holding this machine in hand, it‚Äôs hard to imagine its size.  Not for nothing that Fujitsu U1010 got the title of the smallest laptop with a tablet case.  At first, the thickness is a little confusing, but you quickly get used to it and you begin to understand that if the body is thinner, this ‚Äúbaby‚Äù was not so convenient to use.  According to the manufacturers, the weight of the computer is only 630 grams without charging.  On my scales it turned out about 750 grams without charging, and somewhere around 1200 grams with European charging.  It is convenient to keep the computer on weight, hands do not get tired even after long use of the UMPC. <br><br> <a href="http://imgshare.ru/v.php%3Fid%3D3ce24b4b5145cf01c116cd243764e717.jpg"><img src="http://imgshare.ru/thumbs/3ce24b4b5145cf01c116cd243764e717.jpg"></a> <br><br>  On the upper side of the laptop are the main controls.  On the left are two mouse buttons and a small speaker.  On the right - two buttons up / down, some kind of replacement wheel on the mouse, as well as a joystick that performs the role of a mouse.  Between the up / down buttons is a small Fn key.  At first, I thought it was an alternative to the Fn button on the keyboard, but it turned out not.  I did not find the value of this key, but I hope that, someday, I will understand why it is needed. <br><br> <a href="http://imgshare.ru/v.php%3Fid%3Dba392d9ef6fdfaf9f1a7ddf4b0041bcf.jpg"><img src="http://imgshare.ru/thumbs/ba392d9ef6fdfaf9f1a7ddf4b0041bcf.jpg"></a> <br><br>  Turn the screen.  If the UMPC is running Windows Vista with correctly installed drivers, then the image will turn over 180 degrees automatically.  Otherwise you have to do it manually.  Above, above the screen, there are three keys.  By default, the right button turns on the backlight, the middle one opens the on-screen keyboard, the left one rotates the image 90 degrees.  Below is a web-camera, microphone and stylus.  In the upper part of the left edge is installed a fingerprint scanner, next to it is the Alt button.  By default, this key replaces the combination of Ctrl + Alt + Del.  The edges of the lid have a rough surface, thanks to which it is even more convenient to keep the UMPC.  Summarizing, we can say that Fujitsu is very conveniently located all the UMPC controls that are available when using it in this form.  The up / down buttons make it easy to read books, a joystick that supports pressing the left mouse button is very convenient for surfing the web.  Can not but please and the ability to quickly call the on-screen keyboard. <br><br>  We will return the screen to its place.  Before us opens the QWERTY-keyboard, but slightly reduced.  Despite its size, it is convenient to use it, but you need a little getting used to the specifics of the layout.  The keyboard is convenient to use not only when the laptop is on something, but also on weight.  If you practice, then in a couple of days the typing speed with two thumbs will be big enough. <br><br> <a href="http://imgshare.ru/v.php%3Fid%3Dad23610bc73c60b30444147de0f4311d.jpg"><img src="http://imgshare.ru/thumbs/ad23610bc73c60b30444147de0f4311d.jpg"></a> <br><br> <a href="http://imgshare.ru/v.php%3Fid%3D920f1b2d17799979fcd0eb496ebfc34b.jpg"><img src="http://imgshare.ru/thumbs/920f1b2d17799979fcd0eb496ebfc34b.jpg"></a> <br><br> <a href="http://imgshare.ru/v.php%3Fid%3D8b0b673a35102ff9ae61f2bb0213af54.jpg"><img src="http://imgshare.ru/thumbs/8b0b673a35102ff9ae61f2bb0213af54.jpg"></a> <br><br> <a href="http://imgshare.ru/v.php%3Fid%3D7cf493f4c213e5f079a69d4e6acc6580.jpg"><img src="http://imgshare.ru/thumbs/7cf493f4c213e5f079a69d4e6acc6580.jpg"></a> <br><br>  Take a look at the computer from other sides.  On the right side there is a power button, a USB port covered with plastic and a slot for a Type I / II CF Card.  In front there is only a connector for connecting a VGA / LAN adapter, a port of a replicator or a docking station for a car.  Everything except the VGA / LAN adapter is purchased separately.  Especially for autotourists, a GPS navigator is built into the docking station for the car.  The left side is much richer.  It contains audio input and output, volume control with the ability to completely mute, SD / MMC card reader, charging connector and a switch to enable / disable Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. <br><br> <a href="http://imgshare.ru/v.php%3Fid%3D54485fdcd225638825fd0b171277d723.jpg"><img src="http://imgshare.ru/thumbs/54485fdcd225638825fd0b171277d723.jpg"></a> <br><br> <a href="http://imgshare.ru/v.php%3Fid%3D6a62f975be54150e229ac351b500a5a0.jpg"><img src="http://imgshare.ru/thumbs/6a62f975be54150e229ac351b500a5a0.jpg"></a> <br><br>  The rear is only the connector for the battery.  On the reverse side of the UMPC, perhaps, there is nothing interesting.  Here it is worth paying attention only to the rubber legs, which are perfectly kept both on the desktop and in the plane on the folding table. <br><br> <a href="http://imgshare.ru/v.php%3Fid%3D531051f3a79463a0dbcac18f857e513b.jpg"><img src="http://imgshare.ru/thumbs/531051f3a79463a0dbcac18f857e513b.jpg"></a> <br><br>  A few words about the case.  Leather case with metal protective inserts, received as a gift from the Thai, turned out to be extremely practical.  It is suitable for use with both standard and advanced batteries.  It has cutouts for all connectors, except for the CF Card.  In place of the vents in the UMPC, nets are sewn into the cover.  The case fits the computer case tightly and, in my opinion, protects it well, and thanks to the clasp made with the button, the case doesn‚Äôt open accidentally in the bag. <br><br>  Summing up the description of the appearance, I would like to say that, in my opinion, Fujitsu tried to make the device as convenient and practical as possible and it worked out great for her.  The device is convenient to use and on the weight and put on the table, and in tablet form and in the form of a laptop.  The 5.6-inch screen is ideal for watching movies on the go and viewing web pages.  And its size and weight allow you to always carry with you almost a full-fledged laptop. <br><br>  The manufacturer claims that the computer goes on sale with different operating systems: Windows Vista Home Premium and Business, as well as Windows XP Tablet PC Edition.  I managed to find only the version with Vista Home Premium on sale.  After the first launch, the laptop was pretty slow.  Long attempts to install Windows XP Tablet PC Edition and configure it for full-fledged work were unsuccessful.  Windows XP does not support some of the functions available in Vista, for example, it was not possible to adjust the automatic image rotation when the screen is rotated.  After fussing with XP, it became clear that UPMC is optimized to work under Windows Vista.  After reading the English-language UMPC lovers' forums, we managed to perfectly optimize Windows Vista, and now the system is fast and does not think for five minutes, as it was before optimization.  If someone needs it, I will sign what to disable and what, how to set it up so that everything works well. <br><br>  Arriving in Moscow and starting to actively use the UMPC, I was very sorry that I did not buy a battery of increased capacity.  A standard battery lasts just over two hours with Wi-Fi on and medium brightness.  People using an extra battery say it lasts more than four hours, under the same conditions. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.fujitsu.com/my/services/computing/pc/notebooks/useries/u1010/specs.html">Laptop specifications on the official website</a> <br><br>  If you like my review, I advise you to add a favorites link to my blog <a href="http://cebit2008.ru/">Cebit2008.ru</a> .  On Tuesday, I will fly to Germany and will be at the exhibition on Wednesday.  On Wednesday evening, readers of the blog will be able to see photos from the exhibition and learn about the most interesting things that will come from first-hand. <br><br>  PS According to the law of meanness, a few weeks after my return to Moscow, Fujitsu released the same UMPC model with 3.5G support.  At first I was very upset that I did not become the owner of an improved model, but after seeing the photos of the new version, the sadness passed.  Nevertheless, it is better to do without 3.5G than to have a laptop with ears-antennas. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/21168/">https://habr.com/ru/post/21168/</a></p>
