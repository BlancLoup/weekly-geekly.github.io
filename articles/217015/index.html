  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Samsung Electronics History: From Dried Fish to High Tech</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> Hi, Habr! <br><br>  You always warmly welcomed my posts on the subject of history - for example, about <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/194662/">Nintendo</a> , <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/boxowerview/blog/214333/">navigators</a> , <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/212483/">smart watches</a> and <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/195972/">Soviet computers</a> .  This time, Samsung, one of the largest manufacturers of high-tech components and telecommunications equipment, came under the distribution.  I hope that this time you will like the post. <br><br>  Of course, it would not have been possible to tell everything at once - since Samsung produces too much, including construction equipment, chemicals and food products.  Here, only the major milestones - as the creation of the first serial Blu-ray player, curved TVs, smart watches, android phones and badphones.

His father was a large landowner, so he could afford to send his son to the University of Tokyo.  After the death of his father, Lee Bin Chol uses the inheritance in order to open his own business - although at that time in South Korea it was not an easy task, since the country was a Japanese colony. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/284/dfe/a65/284dfea65085dd9d6a951e895a8d4a4c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  On the image - a warehouse in the city of Daegu, from which the history of Samsung began. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/529/79f/66b/52979f66b0d635b13280983359644792.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In 1938, the name Samsung Trading Company appeared - then it was a company exporting goods to China and Manchuria.  The entrepreneur did not stop there and founded several other companies that were engaged in the production of sugar and fabric, as well as an insurance company. <br><br>  Lee Bin Chol passed away in 1987. <br><br><h4>  TVs </h4><br>  In the 1960s, Samsung began the era of black and white TVs.  The company combines with Sanyo and launches its first black and white TV with the designation p-3202.  In 1976, the millionth b / w television company was produced. <br><br>  To start the production of TVs, Samsung-Sanyo Electronics was formed, renamed Samsung Electro-Mechanics in 1975 and became Samsung Electronics in 1977. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/196/245/ea5/196245ea52ca5d4b569007f39fb0ed31.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In 1987, an institute was created, which began developing new products.  As soon as international laws allowed in the 1990s, Samsung immediately began exporting televisions around the world.  Together with Sony, the company was engaged in the development of liquid crystal displays.  In the late 1990s, Samsung produced the largest 30-inch LCD displays. <br><br>  One of the models of 1997. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a68/720/840/a68720840a9a85ad9c84d637b7b073af.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In 1998, the company began producing flat-screen TVs.  At the beginning of this century, the company was leading the industry by creating the thinnest TV in 2002 and the world's first two-way liquid crystal display in 2006. In 2005, the largest OLED panel was 21 inches, and it was made by Samsung. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0fa/e1e/c34/0fae1ec347ed3f519a4d11063ff98cf1.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The world's first serial Blu-ray player released by Samsung in 2006.  The model received the designation BD-P1000.  The release of the player helped Blu-ray to win the ‚ÄúWar of Formats‚Äù, and after a couple of years HD DVDs were stopped.  The latest from HD DVD refused company Warner Brothers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1cd/475/abc/1cd475abc6a7ec53a72a42b91097f2da.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In 2007, Samsung presented Internet TV - the ability to simultaneously watch TV shows and receive information from these of your Internet.  A little later, <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/samsung/blog/126821/">Samsung Smart TV appeared</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ec1/4a7/29a/ec14a729a9cc867f3ca8c02cdeb75c60.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cba/5a2/3c4/cba5a23c4c5a08726c836773cf6d4bd9.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In 2010, sales of Samsung 3D TVs began.  Over the first six months, they bought over a million copies.  The company became the first in the industry to have a full range of 3D equipment for the home: TVs, Blu-ray players, content and glasses. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f3c/43b/572/f3c43b572c8b92d4a4ded60d78aa3592.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The world's first curved UHD TV was introduced by Samsung in 2014 at CES.  The diagonal of the TV is 105 inches, the aspect ratio is 21: 9.  The screen resolution is 5120 x 2160 pixels.  Auto Depth Enhancer technology allows you to view 3D movies without glasses.  The company‚Äôs UHD line-up now includes a dozen models.  On these "smart" TVs, you can also play games from Electronic Arts (EA) and Gameloft.  The brains are the quad-core processor from Samsung. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/950/7a3/6c9/9507a36c9334fb013cf06ccbf1a1d444.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Cell phones and smartphones </h4><br>  Samsung entered the telecommunications market in 1977, forming the Samsung Telecommunications division, which became part of the Samsung Group.  The division was created for the production of mobile phones and other portable devices - laptops, music players, as well as network equipment. <br><br>  10 years after the opening of the division, in 1988, the SH-100 cell phone entered the Korean market.  Not only is this the first cell made by Samsung, it is also the first cell made in Korea, because the gadget is very symbolic. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c68/121/bf9/c68121bf96d99e80231cb0d281023cd7.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  SH-700 was released in 1993.  It was an "ultra-light" cell phone - it weighed only one hundred grams.  It was much smaller than the phones offered at that time by other companies. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/044/b6c/6b0/044b6c6b083180c8408a4abab22393a7.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In 2003, the clamshell SPH-A500 was one of the easiest, comfortable and stylish. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/92f/302/a0c/92f302a0c2e16a694634899917775563.png" alt="image"><br><br>  In the same year, Samsung unveiled its first phone on Windows Mobile 2002. It was the SCH-i600.  Concurrently, this is the first cellular company working with 3G. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8a4/b5e/751/8a4b5e751fe633d56126089346ab633d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The 2004 model of the A790 was the first CDMA- and GSM compatible Samsung phone.  This clamshell also has two displays, the diagonal of the inner one is 2.35 inches.  By the way, there was no speakerphone and e-mail support in it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ec2/85b/c03/ec285bc03c8aff27bfdb4d4c09357920.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  And here is one of the first camera phones!  The Samsung MM-A800 slider, debuted in 2005, became the first cellular with a 2 megapixel camera in the United States.  But he had a flaw: he did not work on 3G networks. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/faf/1d9/656/faf1d9656b5c7e269f29cf3006ac5e31.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Slim and attractive U600 - slider with 2.2 inch display.  Now the navigation button is not trapezoidal, as in previous models, but round. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/68b/24b/768/68b24b76886ecc540a5f178a28dd51a6.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Samsung BlackJack in 2003 was a dream for many.  He worked in 3G and had a keyboard.  In my opinion, it was a great business class phone at the time.  Suddenly, the company was attacked by Trolls from RIM - they were sure that consumers could not distinguish Blackberry from Blackjack. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fec/cde/108/feccde10836085225ebebbb0c77b9dd8.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  After 4 years, the Samsung Ultra II line went on sale in Russia. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9c1/7ae/390/9c17ae3901b849cbe66376f685522d0e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/401/8a0/1f2/4018a01f2393a432cc2c0c65c7c6e3af.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The first touchscreen phone Samsung released in 2008.  This cell could boast flash-3D effects, gesture control and tactile feedback.  Which, however, I always turn off when I take a new gadget in my hands. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/471/236/592/4712365922a9edc7a5bc72ea85954121.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  And here is one of the first Android smartphones - I7500 - appeared in 2009, it was the very first Galaxy.  It had a 3.2-inch AMOLED display, connected to Wi-Fi, had a built-in GPS receiver.  Thickness - just 11.9 millimeters. <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/LRZxlylo4-c%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgcZVV8ld1iS3sgLbdfPS5lfzKLNw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8ce/dd3/e3a/8cedd3e3a2bffbb721e4cb6889875dbc.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In 2010, the first smartphone was released, working with the bada 1.0 operating system.  It was the flagship Samsung Wave S8500.  The operating system lived only a few years, until in February 2013 Samsung did not announce the merger of bada with Tizen, thereby declaring the end of bada.  Who owned this smartphone - <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/samsung/blog/102896/">which games were played</a> ? <br><br>  Smartphone Wave S8500 is worth noting for its display - for the first time SuperAMOLED was used.  The Super Active Matrix Organic Light-Emitting Diode technology assumes that the touch layer is glued to the screen, which eliminates the air gap in between.  Thus, these displays have higher clarity, images are better visible in the sun, colors are richer, and the display itself is thinner. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Specifications Samsung Wave S8500</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  <b>Operating system:</b> bada <br>  <b>Processor:</b> Samsung Exynos 3110, 1000 MHz <br>  <b>Video Processor:</b> PowerVR SGX540 <br>  <b>Display:</b> 3.3 inch SuperAMOLED <br>  <b>Built-in memory:</b> 2 GB <br>  <b>Memory Card Support:</b> microSD (TransFlash), up to 32 GB <br>  <b>Camera:</b> 5 Mp., 2560x1920, built-in flash <br>  <b>Standard:</b> GSM 900/1800/1900, 3G <br>  <b>Interfaces:</b> Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 3.0, USB <br>  <b>Battery capacity:</b> 1500 mAh <br>  <b>Weight:</b> 118 g <br>  <b>Dimensions:</b> 56x118x11 mm </div></div><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/387/080/2a7/3870802a752f372c5dd6a4cd769659f0.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Samsung Galaxy S was released in 2010.

The smartphone was built on the basis of the Exynos 3110 processor, which worked in conjunction with 512MB of RAM.  But he did not have an expansion slot - he had to limit himself to the built-in 16GB.

Samsung‚Äôs most anticipated smartphone of 2011 caused a lot of rumors, which in the end did not materialize.

And the Galaxy S5 16 megapixel main camera is built using Samsung's ISOCELL technology.  The essence of the technology is the creation of a physical barrier between neighboring pixels, which ‚Äúallows a greater number of photons to accurately come from a specific microlens and assemble in the desired photodiode with a minimum level of unwanted electrical crosstalk between pixels.‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/146/74e/984/14674e9842c24ab2db0a01b52b731c8f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Wearable electronics </h4><br>  One of the pioneers in the field of "smart watches" was the company Samsung.  In 1999, the Samsung SPH-WP10, a wrist phone in the form factor of watches, went on sale.  The project could be as revolutionary as smartphones.  But at that moment, for some reason, it seemed to everyone that it was stylish, but no more.  And now, in 2014, we see that ‚Äúsmart watches‚Äù have become very popular. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/01f/936/841/01f936841ed751400e18543799f53b2e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In 2001, Samsung brought a new hybrid of watches and cell phones to CES in Las Vegas, which looks much more interesting.  The gadget had a monochrome display and understood the voice commands after pressing the appropriate button. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/72e/d1a/0be/72ed1a0beebf04a750101d5006e8a8e2.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Smart watches stubbornly did not want to become trends!  But Samsung did not give up and again presented a gadget of such a form factor in 2009. The Samsung S9110 had a touchscreen display. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7b3/1f5/c9b/7b31f5c9bd9014ac6226f7a787beb0fa.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In October, Samsung again made an attempt to seize the market for these devices, presenting the Samsung Galaxy Gear to the world. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/f2AjPfHTIS4&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhiPTJ5z99KaUtzF0_sPyDqf2PX9RA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/989/139/d87/989139d8760298254c611ed5e7573d22.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The continuation was Samsung Galaxy Gear 2.
