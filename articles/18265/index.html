  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Games and rodents</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> Mice, rats, hamsters and other cute rodents have always been a rather pleasant company for humans.  Well, of course, except when they ate the grain stored for the winter and carried the plague. <br>  The cats walked by themselves, the dog-friend-man preferred to go hunting with the father of the family, and who was left in the house?  Mice.  At first they were not noticed, then they tried to tame them - to settle the best representatives in the cells and five-liter jars.  Finally, with the development of progress, the mouse moved into a virtual environment.  As characters and in other interesting qualities ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <strong>Real rat game</strong> <br>  As you know, the first game of humanity in which the mouse participated, and better the rat, was the so-called ‚Äúrat game‚Äù.  It was for this game that Johnny Miller prepared his famous ‚Äúrat on a string‚Äù, which he later paid off with Tom Sawyer for the opportunity to paint the fence a little. <br>  As said, in Mark Twain, the string was tied to a rat, so that ‚Äúit was easier to turn it.‚Äù  From this detail, the rules of the game become a little clearer.  In general, they are.  The presenter with a rat in his hands (he holds it by the tail or, more hygienically, by the string) gathers around him a crowd and commands ‚Äústarted‚Äù.  The crowd scatters around the playing area, and the leader - whether from a place, running or running - throws a rat at them, having previously untwisted it in the manner of slings. <br>  The Russian equivalent of the "rat game" is a little appetizing called "Cif" or "Salki".  The rat is almost never used in it. <br><br>  <strong>Mouse Boosters from Mars</strong> <br>  Before it turned into a totem gaming manipulator of the first-person shooter genre, the computer mouse had two false starts.  And the first one was just a failure - it was called Wolfenstain 3D, and the second one - it was called DooM - was not so much a failure as it was dishonest and dishonest. <br>  The fact is that young John Carmack, programming the DooM engine, decided to give the data processing from the keyboard and mouse into two different subroutines.  As a result, some movements (sideways, reversal) on the mouse were obtained one and a half (!!!) times faster than on the keyboard.  And although the craftsmen to play with the help of a computer rodent could then be counted on a finger, the most agile of them worked wonders. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/8de/723/19a/8de72319a1816bef7bd4aded9da44936.png" width="450" height="337" hspace="10" vspace="10">

      <strong>Era of mouselook</strong> <br>  Most likely, Carmack and Romero themselves did not plan for Quake to be a revolution in control in the shooter genre.  Otherwise, why should they thrust progressive thinking into the jungle of console programs?  However, it happened.  The golden key of the mouselook team opened the door to a wonderful new world in which the pinpoint zone of defeat of enemies dwelled, an instant reversal, sniper shots, a sense of the three-dimensionality of being, and much, much more that in recent years has been digging into the grave with nimble consoles and gamepad. <br>  Actually, mouselook made the first-person shooter genre the way we know it.  The keyboard is not that did not give the carnage to turn around - not at all - it dictated another worldview.  Covered in the limitations of button-clicking, the genre was sort of a labyrinth arcade in the first person.  The essence of which is not to "kill all humans", but "to reach the point" BE "with minimal losses." <br>  Mouselook brought a sense of shooting to shooters.  Cowboy habits of the Wild West, where the most cold-blooded and most accurate wins.  Well ... and also the one who has the best mouse - on this, by the way, the national Logotech and the elite Razor have risen. <br><br>  <strong>Angel and rats</strong> <br>  Although the rat is a rather ordinary animal, they are not in a hurry to invite her to any significant role in the game.  And if a rat somehow appears in an entertainment project, then, of course, it will be ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù: upright, speaking in a human voice, wearing a tuxedo and smoking a cigar. <br>  Mad genius David Perry was never afraid to be frank.  His first iconic character was a simple earthworm.  That is, not quite simple - but upright and in a spacesuit - but this is forgivable of youth.  In the future, Perry did not give himself and others concessions, and his madness became more and more inundated. <br>  Having finished the MDK's surrealistic masterpiece, Perry fell in love with the progressive technology of automatic reduction of frame detail.  It is on her that he makes the game about the journey of an angel in the world of the human future, Messiah. <br>  In this game, as you may remember, the angel could move into the bodies of any characters.  Including - and in the body of the rat.  An ordinary garbage rat, which allowed the heavenly messenger to travel through the sewage treatment plants of the city of the future, penetrate secret military bases and jump out in front of the commander-in-chief with punitive forces.  Naturally, to instantly move from the tailed gray calf into the megaclaughian shining with a cockade. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/5f4/df9/0a9/5f4df90a9cedf761ad8e8ce46e105634.jpg" width="450" height="337" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><br>  <strong>Big mouse mystification</strong> <br>  Yes, people dislike rats and mice - that‚Äôs a fact.  The example of Mickey Mouse, the best friend of children and the single deity of earthlings from the point of view of the inhabitants of the planet Dragon, is not at all indicative.  Mice and rats are always choked with cats.  And cats, respectively, were also strangled later, through the mass release of polygraphs of ball polygraphs. <br>  A team of young ball-riders in the suburban town of Zelenograd appeared on the pages of the domestic gaming industry back in 1996.  The future uncompromising fireman in the gang was led by a man and ‚Äúto all the journalists ‚Äî a fiery hello‚Äù, Vitaly Shutov.  The man is so cool that all the Chelyabinsk men simply smoke. <br>  The first work of "MIST Land" (then not yet gone to Yukh) was the project "Bestiary" - a progressive strategic tale about the war of straight-erecting cats against the empire of fascist mice and rats.  Also erect.  The domestic company ElectroTECH Multimedia was involved in the publication of the game. <br>  Unfortunately, the crisis of 1998 permanently deprived gamers of the planet of pleasure to command the army of Murants in the battle against one hundred mouse kings, leaving the developers a very negative debut-failure experience, usable brand 3D engine, the agenda for the army of militarist lawlessness ... <br><br>  <strong>Kill the rat, save the soul</strong> <br>  If there were a few good mice and rats in the games, that it was loved in projects of all times and genres to chop up freedom-loving rodents into Hungarian goulash.  However, for some reason, remember the glorious Fallout. <br>  Characteristically, the rats in Fallout were fairly innocuous creatures - apparently, the insult of gamers on these lovely hotbed of deadly diseases was provoked by the debut troubles of the protagonist.  Weak and weak he and rats could be bitten quite easily. <br>  The rattle offense baton took over from Fallout the recent role-playing game ‚ÄúUnderground Order Man‚Äù, where the main character had to be cleared of rodents (rats in prison do not like, unlike roosters) a whole warehouse.  Apparently, Dmitry Yuryevich Puchkov‚Äôs combat experience in exterminating the livestock of St. Petersburg patsyuk was concentrated in this game scene. <br>  Finally, rats in the game The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion also gave good combat experience.  Having climbed to almost any underground rookery, the main character could in the shortest possible time update his sword at least about a dozen opposing squealing teeth. <br><br>  <strong>Our mice are the best</strong> <br>  Unlike rats, with mice ‚Äî as with smaller brothers ‚Äî demand is not so great.  Especially with whites, traditionally taken by Russian society as a whole favorably. <br>  2007 was the birth of the children's project ‚ÄúThree small white mice.‚Äù  In the studio, Lazy Games decided to make an uncomplicated, but interesting family quest with an emphasis on the quality of handmade graphics.  It turned out, I must say, very cool: the first part of the series - ‚ÄúThree little white mice.  The visit of the sea rat "received an excellent press and love of gamers. <br>  At the end of this year (literally the other day) it is planned to release a second, New Year by topic, series - ‚ÄúThree little white mice.  The birthday of the sea rat ", and in the spring of 2008 will appear" Three small white mice.  Pirates of the North Sea. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/e4d/41d/880/e4d41d880fce9295d57e6fc3096882ad.jpg" width="450" height="299" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><br>  <strong>The most famous rat of our time</strong> <br>  The most famous rat of our time - Steel, "forged" in 1985 by the famous American visionary Harry Harrison - oddly enough, still does not have its own personal game.  At least commercially published. <br>  In the womb of the Internet, we found only <a href="http://www.mi.ru/~tonic/steelrat.html">an interactive browser game-book</a> .  As it is written in its preface, the design of the game was done by the owner of the electronic library Lib.ru Maxim Mashkov. <br>  In any case, all fans of Harrison, all lovers of rats and mice, all fans of good reading and science fiction are strongly recommended.  Especially on the eve of the year of the Rat. <br>  Holiday greetings! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/18265/">https://habr.com/ru/post/18265/</a></p>
