My name is Konstantin S. Many people know me as the creator and ideological inspirer of seopublic, the only VKontakte community that so widely and massively covers SEO in this social.  network.  More precisely illuminated.  Now the opportunity to support the community and please subscribers with new posts no longer exists.  This will be discussed in the current article. <br>  No hysteria, I just want you not to repeat my mistakes! <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  On November 22, having come tired from the main job, having opened VKontakte, I saw the following message: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/427/b3e/7f1/427b3e7f1ffd133fa26281b7257b58a6.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  What did this mean in particular for me </h2><br>  <b>At 12:38, as a result of the ban, I was deprived of access to:</b>

    <ul><li>  20+ communities with a total of 100,000+ people </li><li>  Advertising cabinet with 10 active advertising companies and 5000r on the account </li><li>  30+ sites where authorization was only through VKontakte.  Some sites even have money. </li><li>  The music I collected over the years.  Music lovers will understand what the playlist of your favorite music is worth.  Not so scary, but also not nice. </li><li>  300 loyal subscribers on the page itself, among which were company executives and representatives of the seo elite of our country. </li><li>  Permanent earnings, which brought me to the community. </li></ul><br><br><h2>  First versions and thoughts </h2><br>  The first thing that occurred to me was: ‚Äúthis is some kind of mistake, now I‚Äôll write to the moderators, and they will unban me in an hour.‚Äù Having stated everything as it is, they say the message because of which I was banned is not spam.  Well, even if it seemed so to you, give a ban for a day, as it happens in such a case, and we will disperse.  What a naive I was then ... <br><br>  After my long sheet of text, I received a short uncomplicated answer: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/d64/888/c8f/d64888c8fef10f02c437014b45945ea8.jpg" alt="image"><br>  After this answer, my first thought crept in: ‚ÄúWhat if this is true and they will block me forever.  Oh, some kind of nonsense, ‚ÄùI thought.  - "Perhaps the moderator did not understand me correctly." <br><br>  I decided to put some pressure, hoping that it would change the course of the dialogue. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/be4/06a/be7/be406abe7822fb5121a2d0c2a750c0db.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In response, I waited for a detailed response and proceedings.  And then, apologies and unlocking.  My naivety did not leave me a chance.  Well, can not those.  support for the largest soc.  network so treat valuable users.  The answer came: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/f95/8e1/f06/f958e1f067b0326a33e251afc5211a31.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  in which TP decided to make a fool, then I understood what they wrote it for.  And you will understand further.  Naturally, the matter did not move, and I, having pressed the button ‚ÄúThe question is not resolved,‚Äù still wrote one intelligible message. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/661/09c/10a/66109c10a80484b1b25f317f49d877c6.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  As a result, came a long and detailed response with a rationale.  I'm a valuable user: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/9b4/357/8ef/9b43578ef43c08c4826da8470529f9ee.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Here I was specifically shaken.  12 days have passed, and what kind of game they deserve about a well-deserved lock is rubbed into me <br>  I am writing a long letter on the nerves, asking them to indicate the point of the rules by which they impose a ban on forever. <br><br>  TP response: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/e04/a05/f24/e04a05f24c57e07c218f63566655711a.jpg" alt="image"><br>  I paraphrase: ‚ÄúWe wanted to solve your problem.  We want a ban for a day, we want forever.  To your mood. " <br><br>  I was in complete stupor.  What kind of violation did you spot?  The message is not familiar to the person, moreover, that before that I had not had such violations for a year.  I was bombed ... <br><br>  After waiting 2 days, I decided to write to another moderator.  Thinking that this student was just unlucky. <br>  Having written the same arguments: ‚ÄúI am white, fluffy, there were no precedents, I constantly bring money to Vkontakte, I develop groups, and therefore social.  network, etc. " <br><br>  To which, I get a clear answer: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/dce/3cd/6dc/dce3cd6dc1281811c695541840671976.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Clear.  Other agents do not have the right to take tickets already started elsewhere for consideration. <br><br><h2>  The end is near </h2><br>  Realizing that there is no point in beating like a fly into glass, I decided to come in from another front.  Find someone who has connections to promote this question. <br><br>  With difficulty, but found.  I wrote everything as it is about trouble, about the fact that the groups were left without admins, about the money in the office, that I would follow the messages next time, etc. <br><br>  The answer came: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/253/f11/646/253f11646cf1fa0facbab7581faf8fd3.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Decipher: The reason for the ban that I see, and you, dear subscribers - linden.  For unsubscribe.  So say, FrontEnd.  And in the correspondence, the anonymous user sent me BackEnd - the real reason for the ban.  Remember that message about the presence of other pages?  They almost let it slip. <br><br>  Then I generally fell into trouble.  I, with 20 active groups and money in the Republic of Kazakhstan will be social.  do phishing work?  Are you completely out there that fell from an oak tree? <br><br>  The next day, I learned that from a working IP, on which we have 60 people, someone is really social.  Fishil, and those.  support that day, without knowing it, distributed bans to everyone who sent messages to strangers.  And to me, incl. <br><br>  In order to save seopublic, I created a new account.  And I wrote in the TP, that would have tied the public to a new account.  The group has no other admins. <br><br>  The answer finished me off completely: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/f01/de9/236/f01de92365e37bec91af895f3ed98a60.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Those.  They found some precedent that was 2-3 years ago, and said that we do not need such communities. <br><br><h2>  Conclusions, gentlemen, which I drew from this whole mess (read to all): </h2><br><ol><li>  In TP, nobody really cares about your problem.  At least the goal, to solve it at any cost, they are not worth it.  I spent hundreds of thousands on advertising this year, developed more than 20 communities that also support interest in this social.  network.  And when I first needed help, they quickly forgot about all this.  Behind the user ID, they see just a record in the database, forgetting that behind it is a real person who has spent years developing communities. </li><li>  With the departure of Durov, the full orgy began in support.  The Internet is teeming with examples of similar problems and relationship screens with double standards.  When for MDK we don‚Äôt see it, and you and your groups just undermine the whole ideology of Vkontakte. </li><li>  You should always have 2-3 administrators for each group.  For safety reasons, I neglected this. </li><li>  Do not fill more than 5000r in the advertising office.  In the case of sanctions, no one will return them to you. </li><li>  The lack of competition in the social market.  networks - creates poor quality.  Just do not say that Facebook is a great replacement. </li><li>  TP agents have magic buttons.  ‚ÄúZadolbal‚Äù, after pressing which you cannot write messages for about a week and the button ‚ÄúAnswer is given‚Äù - after pressing which, any of your messages do not transfer the ticket to the ‚Äúquestion pending‚Äù state.  This proves once again the numbness of rudeness in the functionality of the system. </li></ol><br><br>  <b>And further.</b>  <b>The main rules of any technical support:</b> <br><ol><li>  To tell only the truth - it will speed up the solution of the problem; </li><li>  Make every effort to solve customer problems. </li></ol><br>  Unfortunately, the manual of VKontakte, these archival rules did not inform the saport. <br><br>  Let the country know the id of the agents, who not only did not solve the problem, did not even tell the true reason for it.  As a result, I had to spend 3+ weeks to find out the reason. <br><br><ul><li>  Support Agent # 456 </li><li>  Support Agent # 596 </li><li>  Support Agent # 753 </li><li>  Support Agent # 1230 </li><li>  Support Agent # 1274 </li></ul><br><br>  And I start a new project, outside the social.  network.  And I will never again conduct anything serious there. <br><br>  And seopublic is really a pity.  I still write subscribers, with questions: when will the community be resurrected ?! <br><br>  - Never.  Happy New Year! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/297544/">https://habr.com/ru/post/297544/</a></p>
