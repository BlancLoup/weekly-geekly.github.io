      Vasya didn‚Äôt have a computer until he graduated from college, but he had an irresistible craving for learning the beautiful, and as a result he was squatting in the corridors and excitedly reading a book called HTML4. <br><br>  When at last the computer appeared - it became much easier to study html. <br><br>  After the end of the sharaga, for two months, I went through a snowy and empty Siberian city, whose employers would rather prefer a bear with a balalaika than such as Vasya, he went to work in his specialty at the plant. <br><br>  I don't care what the other end of the city is.  I do not care that with two transfers and the total travel time was approximately one and a half hours one way.  But there was a salary of four thousand, a lacquered table in a dusty technical bureau and an interesting Su-34 stub in the workshop, which workers had been climbing for the fifth year, unable to complete its assembly.  Product 66.01.06 - the sixth car of the first series.  Vasya would have said more, but for the disclosure of state secrets can ... Yes, nothing can no longer, but this is not the point. <br><br>  *** <br>  While working at the plant, Vasya, following the example of fellow soldiers, ‚Äúentered‚Äù the institute for the specialty ‚Äúprogrammer‚Äù, paying for the first semester of studies and having listened to two and a half lectures.  Thus began the correspondence course in one of the largest universities in Siberia. <br><br>  Continuing to work and starting to learn, standing at the shelves in the World of Books shop, Vasya made a painful choice between PCP and Javascript, after which he bought a php4 book for 56 rubles and began to study it with bitterness. <br>  Six months later, the size of the govnokod reached a critical mass and, after retiring after one and a half years of work for the state, with a salary of five thousand rubles, of which 2-3 were spent on travel and food, Vasya went to work as a webmaster at the office located in relative proximity To home. <br><br>  Things went uphill. <br>  The salary has grown to thirteen thousand, the workplace has acquired a computer and unlimited Internet - which has not yet been at home, except for the internal modem with a pc-speaker, plastered with clay, the working day stretched to 12 hours. <br><br>  Vasya spent the day and night spending the right govnosayty, studying flash, coldfusion, layout - all according to the needs of the work, and continuing to learn php for myself in secret. <br><br>  In six months, the interests of the PM have been forced out of Vasi‚Äôs activities, so his own projects and undertakings have already been given full time.  Also, Vasya went for an interview to another office, already as a php-coder and soon successfully transferred to a new position. <br>  Salary increased by 1 thousand. <br><br>  *** <br><br>  Now the working day has become more moderate. <br>  Flash, crazy cold fusion, layout, photoshop left the field of activity - only php remained. <br>  However, the happiness was short-lived - all the work consisted in correcting bugs on the old govnosaytakh company, interspersed with a complete lack of work, when there was nothing stupid to do. <br><br>  Vasya drank tea, ate free lemons with sugar and continued to study php and javascript. <br>  Half a year has passed in the complete absence of new projects. <br>  The head was replenished only with the knowledge that Vasya himself invested in it, conducting his near-scientific research. <br>  Editing the production govnokod caused only a yawn, and dismal corporate parties, in which the director was yelling like Santa Claus on a New Year tree, telling what kind of friendly team they had in the company - nausea.  By the way, this "friendly" team was fully updated almost every six months.  It was a feature of the company. <br><br>  To the heap, Vasya was expelled from the university, informing him of the found debt in the Russian language for the first course and deducting the next day after the notification.  No comments here. <br><br>  Six months later, Vasya made his first conclusions regarding the work of a programmer at this company and the prospects for his further development. <br>  He read job advertisements, wrote several letters and soon passed an interview in another sharashka, engaged in the development of sites. <br><br>  These businessmen, although they were located in the basement, promised a salary of up to thirty thousand, although payment was relied upon to be piecework.  In other words - by the result.  I did the work - get the money, did not - if you please, you are not on our salary.  Five thousand of a minimum of pieces of paper of course was supposed to. <br><br>  - Who does not risk, that does not drink champagne!  - Vasya said to himself, quit and switched to a new job, having bought a used car on credit. <br>  The act was rash, but he was motivated by the fact that Vasya had been collecting the rights for category B for three months and the experience of driving a rotten seven disappeared without a trace. <br>  But Vasya received the rights for six months, thanks to the entrepreneurial spirit of the director of the driving school !!! <br>  But more about that in another life. <br>  And while it was autumn. <br><br>  *** <br><br>  The room where he got on his first day of work was very different from the one in which the interview was conducted. <br>  It was possible to call this premise an office with a huge stretch, more likely a basement covered with wallpaper, musty and dark.  However, Vasya never sought for luxury, did not expect anything from anyone, so he decided not to make any sudden movements and try his luck in the new team. <br><br>  This time, after some adaptation, he was lucky with a completely new project - CEO-shniki from the neighboring building decided to beat their wounds, with blackjack and related accessories.  On the drupal. <br><br>  Vasya day and night sawed drupal 6, sticking modules to it.  He studied the cunning work of a huge software complex, in which there is not a single mention of the keyword class.  I wrote my own system of virtual currency and dynamic creation of third-level subdomains. <br>  Six months have passed in this movement. <br><br>  At the same time, Vasya met one CEO from Moscow, for whom, as a freelancer, he was given the opportunity to make a goof site.  He received his first payments in a muddy office after he discovered a VM on the territory of a carpool, the first three thousand were welcome and smelled of the future. <br><br>  And SEOs were two.  Vasya mentally shared their passive and active. <br>  The active talked a lot, the passive was silent a lot. <br>  And Vasya neighing, showing them a debag-in, informing him that the opening of the main page of the new portal - of course, containing the features and gadgets that they wanted - made 10 thousand queries to the database.  You can talk about this for a long time and in a colorful way, and Vasya can also be accused of curvature and inexperience, but believe me, she didn‚Äôt play the most important role here - and without gimmicks, he hit them with his ‚Äúperformance‚Äù. <br><br>  After six months, Vasya started. <br>  The crisis had tied the belts to everyone, the bank manager‚Äôs account balance sank and he resolutely ‚Äúdropped the ballast‚Äù. <br>  Vasya and his faithful loan, obligating to pay ten thousand a month, within two years - were on the street.  With all-wheel drive <a href="http://www.drive2.ru/cars/nissan/sunny/sunny_b13/deex/">Nissan Sunny</a> , front-wheel drive that vomited out of a grenade in the Siberian cold.  With the first cute girl who lives in the distance and appeared only recently. <br>  On the crisp March snow under the blindingly bright spring sun. <br><br>  *** <br><br>  Two weeks have passed in a vain search for a new job. <br>  They did not take the old one, making conclusions for themselves that Vasya is not one of those working oxen who mold three govnosayt per day, but sleep at night without dreams.  For some, he was too good, and in some he did not need people with a forehead height of less than thirty centimeters. <br><br>  One loan did not leave Vasya, occasionally reminding himself of voyage sms-kami. <br>  And Vasya got into debt. <br><br>  Debt rose to fifty thousand, in addition to the loan itself, which at that time was about one hundred and eighty, when the black bar changed to white.  But, in the light of what has been experienced further, it would be appropriate to call this strip brown. <br>  Vasya got a job at Art Science Cinema Distribution - a network of cinemas, which also had its own govosite. <br><br>  The work was again at the other end of the city, moreover in a narrow room located behind the wall of the cinema hall, which made the walls occasionally wheezing and trembling, passing through the bass of the stereo system, sometimes the roaring voice of Taras Bulba. <br>  Two Java coders worked with him ‚Äî the admin and everything around was littered with old hardware. <br><br>  Vasya worked for a month on conscience. <br>  The salary was promised with a delay of one more month, so all the same it was still far from the next payment. <br>  Vasya significantly improved the govnosayt code, naturally on his local version, periodically reported on ICQ to the ‚Äúemployer‚Äù, which he has not seen live before, and believed that life is slowly getting better. <br><br>  However, Vasya was curious. <br>  And once he looked into the little room, called the personnel department, where the fat unpleasant aunt was sitting. <br>  After hearing the flow of hysterical screams, in response to a request to get his work record, in order to ascertain whether he really was already employed, Vasya was a little taken aback.  However, the conversation continued and finally got a book, which he literally threw. <br>  Naturally, there was no employment record in it. <br><br>  Vasya did not know how to swear, therefore, talking on the phone with the ‚Äúboss‚Äù, who promised to ‚Äúfind out everything‚Äù, he packed the sources of his work into a password-protected archive and left work.  More he did not appear there. <br><br>  Turning to the authority relying on this occasion, he wrote a letter addressed to someone there and began a new job search. <br>  Looking ahead, it should be said that the letter went around the country for more than a year.  Vasya regularly received waste paper with the same content ‚ÄúForwarded on, notify the sender‚Äù.  Dull Russian relay race between useless and empty instances. <br>  A year later, Vasya finally received a final answer, literally sounding like this: "To establish the fact of an employment relationship with an employer, you have the right to go to court."  However, great!  Only after receiving this letter, he finally found out that he has the right to do so.  Bravo. <br><br>  *** <br><br>  The next office turned out to be a decent company, regularly paying salaries and containing a large staff. <br>  One ‚ÄúBut‚Äù - the sites were made on Bitrix, to which there is still a rather meaningless online certification, as a result of which you get yourself an email certificate, which you can then print out and hang on the wall in the toilet. <br>  Vasya was given a computer, put on a broken chair and was harnessed to receive literacy. <br><br>  Two weeks passed. <br>  - Vasya, you are not suitable for us.  You are not too eagerly received literacy.  Say hello to your credit and debts, I hope we will not meet again. <br><br>  And Vasya could not work like that!  He could not, in spite of any debts, turn into an insignificant plant, having a huge potential for further development.  Therefore, gritting his teeth and, what a sin to conceal, after crying, Vasya went further, wandering around the dull and gray city in search of happiness. <br><br>  to be continued‚Ä¶ </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/109189/">https://habr.com/ru/post/109189/</a></p>
