In the proof of the proposed passage from the drama "Mad Antigone", owned by the ancient Greek playwright Epiharma. <br><br>  The work has not been preserved entirely: only the first action has reached the present day.  From the survivors, it is incontrovertible that the ancient Greeks considered Copyright as one of the deities along with Zeus, Hephaestus, Aphrodite, and other Olympic inhabitants (see <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25C4%25F0%25E5%25E2%25ED%25E5%25E3%25F0%25E5%25F7%25E5%25F1%25EA%25E0%25FF_%25EC%25E8%25F4%25EE%25EB%25EE%25E3%25E8%25FF">Wikipedia</a> ).

      For a better understanding, the name of the deity is conveyed in modern sound: literally translated from the ancient Greek "Copyright" would sound like "Owning your thoughts." <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Mad Antigone </h4><br>  <u>Characters:</u> <br><br>  <b>Creon</b> , the lord of Thebes. <br>  <b>Antigone</b> , his niece. <br>  <b>Choir</b> <br><br>  <i>The play takes place in Thebes.</i> <br><br>  <b>one.</b> <br>  <i>Chorus included.</i> <br><br>  <b>Chorus:</b> <br>  Obey the orders of the gods <br>  Thebans - it was and will be. <br>  From Olympus commanded us <br>  What to do and how to act. <br>  The law of Apollo is one, <br>  The other is Demeter's abundant, <br>  And the third - fearless - law <br>  Bloody brings Ares. <br>  People are accustomed to them, <br>  The laws of the primeval gods, <br>  However, the lord Creon, <br>  Recently set foot in power, <br>  Entered the list of ancient gods <br>  Young mighty god. <br>  This god is called - Copyright <br>  He is waiting for cleansing victims. <br>  Dread, the Thebans, him! <br>  Suddenly a word slipping from your <br>  Larynx - the sound of someone else's song? <br>  Does it want to die then? <br><br>  <b>2</b> <br>  <i>Creon and Antigone enter.</i> <br><br>  <b>Creon:</b> <br>  Palace chambers dressed in mourning. <br>  My nephew is yours, Antigone, brother - <br>  Fell the death of the brave in a merciless battle. <br>  With you we mourn in unity. <br><br>  <b>Antigone:</b> <br>  Oh, poor Polynik!  I imagine only <br>  That he died, sobbing an hour in a row: <br>  Eyes tear themselves from loss. <br><br>  <b>Creon:</b> <br>  He in the realm of the dead is already celebrating <br>  Victory in the battle in which he was defeated <br>  But the body blocked the passage of enemies <br>  To the holy Thebes.  We know about it <br>  And reward the hero as <br>  Polynik deserves brave. <br>  We are with the royal honors of his <br>  The remains in the best place to bury. <br><br>  <b>Antigone:</b> <br>  And I'll shed a tear <br>  And I read on the grave of my brother <br>  Any rhyme.  After all Polynic <br>  It was a poet, which in Greece is not enough. <br>  In this art, he excelled <br>  Alkey with Semonid, combined. <br>  I was told Polynik melodious <br>  Like Homer himself, the most ancient of poets. <br>  I'll read the stanzas, remember <br>  The deceased tear maiden light <br>  And I will return to life with a sigh. <br><br>  <b>Creon:</b> <br>  So, Antigone, do not come. <br><br>  <b>Antigone:</b> <br>  What to do?  Shed tears and sigh <br>  Oh brother, who gave his life for a homeland? <br><br>  <b>Creon:</b> <br>  Read poems during the funeral. <br><br>  <b>Antigone:</b> <br>  But why?  Brother is unworthy <br>  Your wonderful sonorous lines? <br>  He's so different.  When I <br>  Will get sad il ridicule fall, <br>  Immediately I recall his stanzas <br>  Depending on what i <br>  The hunt now is to cry or laugh. <br>  I'll pick poems worse <br>  And I read on the grave of my brother. <br>  Let the guests at his funeral <br>  Doubly sob from the loss of heavy. <br><br>  <b>Creon:</b> <br>  You wake copyright reading! <br><br>  <b>Antigone:</b> <br>  Ah, this new god!  Indeed <br>  Is he bloodthirsty or are people lying? <br><br>  <b>Creon:</b> <br>  They do not lie, but they understand little: <br>  Among the gods Hellas Copyright <br>  Without any doubt, the most stringent. <br>  When commands that poems <br>  Dead poets do <br>  At his disposal, know this: <br>  Poems will abide in the temple of Copyright. <br>  Leave the property of the deceased <br>  Yourself by blood inheritance, <br>  But give the writing to the deity. <br>  Literature is a region of the unearthly. <br>  Poets illuminates the highest spirit: <br>  He that composed, takes, <br>  To keep the temple clean. <br>  When you want to read the creation <br>  Poet, go freely to the temple <br>  Divine Copyright to <br>  There to read what you want, <br>  But first pay for the visit. <br>  Do you feel sorry for two coins, <br>  To read the creations of Polynic? <br><br>  <b>Antigone:</b> <br>  Why pay?  I remember them by heart <br>  And I will gladly retell anyone <br>  Who will ask ... Happy Polynik <br>  Usually he sang them where it was necessary: <br>  On the street, in the market and in the garden. <br>  He said that stanzas are birds, <br>  Fly where they want and how they want, <br>  You can not catch them - you can only listen. <br><br>  <b>Creon:</b> <br>  Their copyright loop caught <br>  And he locked up in his temple for the attention. <br>  And if anyone dares to let go <br>  At the will of these sweet-hearted birds, <br>  For theft will be thrown off the cliff <br>  And sinks into white foam forever. <br>  Therefore, niece, please - <br>  Not a word on the grave of Polynik. <br>  I could not obey others <br>  The Theban gods ‚Äî say, Dionysus, <br>  Or Hephaestus, or the very <br>  Zeus, the warden of Olympus. <br>  In the end, I'm the first person <br>  In the powerful seven sevens Thebes. <br>  All deities count with me <br>  I'm ready to forgive minor mistakes <br>  But not such a cruel copyright. <br>  I'm afraid I have a fight with this god. <br><br>  <b>Antigone:</b> <br>  A dozen stanzas favorite read <br>  Can't I, burying a sibling? <br>  I do not like injustice <br>  And here I find injustice. <br>  Not every one of the Thebans will score <br>  Gold coins for payment, <br>  Not everyone will open the door of the temple, <br>  Where papyruses are locked forever. <br>  I seem to see, brother Polynik <br>  With a smile, he says to me: "Antigone, <br>  Sister dear, I have my poems <br>  In the inheritance of the townspeople leave. <br>  Let everyone who wants to read <br>  Reads himself or others in public. " <br><br>  <b>Creon:</b> <br>  Look, I warned you. <br><br>  <i>Leaves.</i> <br><br>  <b>Antigone:</b> <br>  O Polynic, my brother is one, <br>  You created for free people, <br>  So really on your grave, <br>  My brother, I dare not open my mouth? <br>  Do not be me Antigone, if I do. <br><br>  <b>3</b> <br>  <b>Chorus:</b> <br>  Leave a thought, child. <br>  But is it a girl's business - <br>  Poems on the grave to read? <br>  Public reading is a sin. <br>  Otherwise sin somehow: <br>  Scruffy or rude <br>  Parents decrepit saucy - <br>  Believe me, this is all nonsense. <br>  Wallow in bodily sin <br>  Men pleasing lecherous, <br>  And after extramarital birth - <br>  Gods will forgive the mischievous. <br>  But if you copyright <br>  In pokrashe poems suspect <br>  An agonizing death will die - <br>  I tell you exactly. <br>  The vindictive god of copyright, <br>  Insults do not forgive anyone: <br>  Other offense will forgive <br>  And only copyright - never. <br><br>  <b>PS</b> The following text has not been preserved, but it is easy to present it from the works of other authors: Antigone did not fulfill the requirements of the Copyright and was thrown off the cliff. <br><br>  The myth of Antigone, who sacrificed his life to perpetuate his brother‚Äôs poetic talent (as an option for the funeral), is one of the most relevant and touching pages in the history of world literature. <br><br>  <i>¬© Epiharm, 484 BC</i> <i><br></i>  <i>¬© mikejum, 2013 after R.Kh.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/183798/">https://habr.com/ru/post/183798/</a></p>
