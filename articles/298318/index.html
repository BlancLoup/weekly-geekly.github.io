Hey, wait!  Do not rush to close the page with the words "Sick bastards!" ... I will explain everything.  This is a mobile app for iOS only.  No, not even so.  This mobile application is for iPhone only.  Not that again.  This mobile application is only for iPhone S-versions.  Hmmm ... it only got worse.  Then, we will briefly try to figure out what is the matter and why we decided to make a mobile application, which, without exaggeration, a million in the market, and even narrowing the number of potential users to the iPhone S-versions. <br><br><h5>  Prerequisites </h5><br>  Apple has announced last year two new versions of the iPhone - 6S and 6S Plus.  It is a traditional move for the team from Kuppertino.  New models visually have not changed, having received a more powerful stuffing and a new feature - 3D Touch.  This technology allows you to determine the force of pressing on the screen, opening up new possibilities for working with the interface.  As a person directly connected with the development, I was rather skeptical about using 3D Touch in the interface.  At first.  Why?  The answer is simple.  All 3D Touch capabilities are Hidden features, that is, a person can only empirically know if this or that interface element has support for this technology.  Perhaps in the future, designers will learn to visually mark the interface elements with support for 3D Touch. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/02f/e0b/d97/02fe0bd97396d4597d0d6b2534825c9f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  On the other hand, this is a good start for pro-users.  An interface that works well on the stage of onboarding and learning how to use a product may not be so good for people who actively use it.  I3D Touch will come to mobile phones, like short / hot keys on desktops. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/Eb17Gtioioc%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjM6qtlsa3rIt9ij_DSfxnS_1XIGw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Something I got carried away, back to our wallpaper.  Another innovation was Live Photos.  After taking a photo, the user can play a short video with a strong push, sort of like animating a frozen image.  I played with Live Photos for a couple of days and realized that as a result I get so-so pictures and shitty videos, with a low frame rate, a total of 2 times more than a regular photo. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/8c7uehma8Wc%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhiiXODQ2XeyQb9-C5gMLu0UY4CcRA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  But!  Together, these two technologies have opened a wonderful world of animated wallpaper.  And not just animated wallpapers, as it was in iOS 7, when the user was available 8 pre-installed screen savers, similar to the colorful snot (remember these circles floating on the screen?).  The key difference of this type of personalization is not immediately obvious, but it is vital - <b>to play the animation, the user must interact with the animated cover!</b>  (Press and hold!) <br><br>  Do you understand how cool it is?  A person must perform a physical action!  It is the need for physical action that opens up the possibility for the user to develop his habits (I, at least, I hope for this).  If you look at the stages that the user goes through using the product, then the covers available before have no important element - Action: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/9a0/e12/281/9a0e12281a054b3f0af6fd03551342c5.png" alt="image"><br><br>  In the case of 3D Touch, we have a very specific action required from the user.  With the right product and positioning, we can create a real need for new and new animations for the phone. <br><br><h5>  Competitors </h5><br>  As it turned out, I'm not the only one so smart (this is a surprise!), And some developers have already released apps with Live Wallpapers.  Qualitative a bit.  To be honest, three.  These are the ones that at least can be used, but the content there is very boring.  And we need to somehow build up in the process of dealing with the prejudice to the products from the category of ‚Äúwallpaper‚Äù.  After all, for the most part they are a sad shit (s), with such a concentration of advertising that I want to break the phone. <br>  If you find a really high-quality product with Live Wallpapers support - share in the comments.  In the following articles I will tell you how we will differ from everyone. <br><ul><li>  So, what prerequisites do we have: </li><li>  Frankly zasranny market wallpaper for mobile phones, where there are no leaders, no brands. </li><li>  The new technology, 3D Touch, which has not yet received wide support from application developers simply because they do not yet know how to use it. </li><li>  A new format of photos Live Photos and the ability to create based on it animated wallpaper. </li><li>  The first wallpaper for your mobile phone, with which you need (and want) to interact. </li><li>  The emerging market, thanks to the release of the 7th version of the iPhone later this year. </li></ul><br>  Perhaps missed something.  But agree - to make an application with wallpaper only for iPhone S-versions no longer looks such idiotic ideas as it seemed at the beginning. <br><br>  I opened all the cards (well, almost), why we decided to take up this particular project.  And according to tradition (for the second time in a row!), I propose to participate in a short survey.  And if you eat ideas for animated screensavers - share in the comments.  Stay Tuned! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/298318/">https://habr.com/ru/post/298318/</a></p>
