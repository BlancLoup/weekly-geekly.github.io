  <section class="page js-page"><h1>New nomads</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Operations: The point of this move is to make IT closer to customers. <br>  Colleague: Then it makes sense for me to move to an office in the south of Moscow instead of the north ‚Äî my main clients are there ... <br>  Operations: Yes, maybe ... <br>  I: And then where should I move? <br>  Chef: And you ... you don't care at all, even to Novosibirsk. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  I remembered this conversation sitting once again on the plane, when I calculated that in the last six months this was my 40th flight.  I am an IT manager "by region" in a large manufacturing company.  The company has almost a hundred branches throughout Russia and the CIS, and at the same time different ‚Äúfilling‚Äù of the regions - somewhere factories and trade, somewhere only trade, and somewhere only raw materials.  Accordingly, the tasks faced by IT are somewhat different. <br><br>  What does this mean for me personally?  Many things.  I work partly in the Moscow office, and partly on business trips, in the vast expanses of ours.  I periodically live in airplanes and airports (the Lord gave us wifi, when will it finally appear free of charge at Russian airports?), I can reply to the mail at 4.00 Moscow time and consider the ideology of remote access to the company's network ‚Äúthe only true teaching‚Äù.

      And now look at your friends / acquaintances / buddies - for sure you will find someone with a similar lifestyle.  Most likely you are increasingly communicating with him remotely - social networks, IM or email - it does not matter.  We are those who are called ‚Äúdigital nomads‚Äù, ‚Äúnetwork nomads‚Äù or, more accurately, ‚Äúnew nomads‚Äù. <br><br>  Here is what <a href="http://www.wordspy.com/words/digitalnomad.asp">WordSpy</a> says: <br>  <strong>digital nomad (n.)</strong> . <br><br>  The film ‚ÄúI would be in heaven‚Äù (‚ÄúUp in the Air‚Äù) with Clooney is about our lifestyle. <br><br>  Such a way of life dictates a certain organization of work: continued the call to Vladivostok until 11 am Moscow time?  Sorry, dear friend, see you tomorrow - it is already 6 pm, people have gone home.  Wrote an email that requires an urgent response in ... hmm ... one of the neighboring countries?  Call in addition - otherwise almost 100% will respond to the letter outside of any reasonable time frame - mentality ... nice people, very hospitable, but very relaxed in work ... <br><br>  It also dictates the requirements for services and stored information: all data is stored in the company's network (the laptop does not last forever, correspondence is very important), a constant backup of contacts, the ability to watch current projects online, corporate IM - more convenient to mail, meetings via LiveMeeting Omsk, at least from Tashkent, and Avaya softphone generally needs to be included in the image of the corporate OS and set up a way out from the outside - to call an internal number is cheaper than calling a mobile ... <br><br>  And the information needs (and with it the appropriate gadgets) are also partly due to the way of life: read something (a book or twenty emails) while sitting at the airport;  watch with a half-closed eye movie in an airplane or find how to get to a hotel in a destination city;  chat on Facebook, while waiting for a delayed flight and stuff like that.  Yes, and so that all this splendor works at least 7-8, and better than 10 hours away from the outlet - an hour in the taxi to the airport and the registration two hours before the flight has not been canceled. <br><br>  A laptop?  Aha  With enhanced battery and corporate XP on board.  And you tried, standing in a crowd of taxi drivers and waving away from the eternal "where we are going, taxis must-eat checks-inexpensive-well they don‚Äôt meet" to get a laptop and, holding it with one hand (in the second portlet, for example), wait until it wakes up go to Outlook and find a letter with the driver‚Äôs contacts?  Nothing complicated - just not comfortable. <br>  As well as carrying with you a bunch of gadgets - a player, a reading room, a couple of phones, different charging ... When you fly only with hand luggage - you get used to appreciate every kilogram and place in the bag. <br><br>  And now let's get a little distracted and look at the story.  There were nomads and were sedentary tribes.  How did knowledge spread among nomads?  Orally.  A nomadic lifestyle does not involve a large baggage of books.  And appropriate skills.  Settling appeared - writing appeared, skills changed - the ability to read and save the accumulated knowledge in writing became necessary for development.  The explosive development of fundamental science among nomads is impossible in principle. <br><br>  Why am I telling all this?  But to what: look around you - the world in a circle has come to such a stage of development when nomads are again in demand and therefore they appear. <br>  As well as infrastructure for us. <br><br>  Appear new devices - Amazon Kindle and netbooks - were the first swallows in this series.  And the MID ideology itself - who else, except geeks and nomads, may need most of the functions of such devices? <br><br>  By the way, the same iPad is almost perfect for my needs.  Not without flaws, but its flaws are only marketing and extra money pumping policy ‚Äî like in a MacBook you need to buy a cable for $ 30 to connect via HDMI to a TV.  Wait a bit - and there will be cables for connecting to the projector and other accessories.  Dock - USB cable, by the way, is already included.  And the next model will probably be with HD screen and WiMax. <br><br>  There are also services for ‚Äúnew nomads‚Äù - Google Voice, Google Docs / Thinkfree / Zoho ... Evernote / Mobile Me, etc.  Social networks - the same.  This does not mean that this service is unavailable or inconvenient to others - but one of the main ideas of these services is independence from the place of use. <br><br>  And the corporate market is not lagging behind - MS Office is working increasingly closely with the corporate portal (at Sharepoint, of course), and the internal portal has long been called "corporate classmates."  LotusLive is actually a ‚Äúcorporate facebook‚Äù ... <br><br>  Want to understand <s>if Jobs screwed up with a tablet</s> who needs a new tablet?  Or <s>where the world is heading</s> what service will be in demand?  Imagine yourself a "new nomad" - what do you need? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/85487/">https://habr.com/ru/post/85487/</a></p>
