  <section class="page js-page"><h1>If you have turned off the Internet?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  So, in some mysterious way you were disconnected from the Internet, without which you can not live a day.  Well, of course - this is a post from America from a beloved friend, an acquaintance from Brazil writes opuses, contacts with Australia and Japan - they should not be forgotten about them either.  The forum about breeding rabbits and Madonna's tips on how to cook manti - all you need is air.  And suddenly it was gone.  You glow the phone to the limit, trying to reach the technical support service, but like you, they have hundreds and thousands, and a non-specialist answers your questions and furious cheers.  What to do? <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  Life has changed beyond recognition.  You woke up and now even make the bed.  You eat breakfast longer and watch the news more carefully - now you don‚Äôt have the opportunity to reread the entire tape.  You look through the diary, you start to remove unnecessary shortcuts from the desktop of the computer and you schedule the genuborku.  Less and less often you have thoughts ‚Äúto see in the internet what's new in cinemas‚Äù.  Increasingly important are newspapers and magazines.  On the first evening without the Internet, you went to bed at 9 pm. <br><br>  You have long had to write a report on the work.  You started the draft.  You remembered that you didn‚Äôt call your former classmate and friend for a long time - you were going to meet and talk for a long time.  The apartment is in perfect order, you know the program guide by heart.  Thoroughly studied the content of your mp3-list.  Sometimes there are impulses to download something.  You remember that it is impossible and again you look through what was.

      Turn off the antivirus - and what's the point now?  Now you can not be afraid of viruses.  Forget email addresses and passwords from them.  And once they knew by heart all five mailboxes and constantly checked them.  There was a time.  Maybe buy a new book?  What are we reading now?  We must look at the magazine. <br><br>  In the morning, with anxiety, check the mailbox - what if it came.  The thought comes to write a novel.  At leisure, you look through old photos, remember memories of past gay past. <br><br>  Walking after work - there‚Äôs no other place to hurry, check email from friends and read the latest comments.  You begin to understand that regular mail is not so bad and long.  Started the first chapter of the novel.  Quite well it turns out. <br><br>  Need to get together with friends, drink a beer.  God, how could you spend so much time on the Internet?  But without it, life is so beautiful!  We must take a camera - walk through the streets to photograph landscapes, and then lay out ... hmm ... on the shelf.  And then call all your friends and show them your masterpieces. <br><br>  We must ask friends, can anyone have a new downloaded audiobooks? .. And ask to send ....  No, pass on a flash drive.  So, it seems you can say goodbye to online communication.  But what about the constant monitoring of all that is happening?  Also have to say goodbye. <br><br>  I was told that they sent a great link to a cool video.  Well, if I‚Äôm brought to the Internet cafe in the near future, I‚Äôll see, but it‚Äôs unlikely.  So do not blame me. <br><br>  After a couple of weeks, you can no longer understand the idea that the Internet can also be at home.  And life has not become worse and more limited.  Just acquired some other shades.  Is it bad or good?  Neither one nor the other. <br><br>  Everything should be in moderation.  And the Internet, and communication in it and in real life.  To say that this addiction is bad is not worth it.  Now in modern life, without this, nothing.  And how else to rake up all that pile of information that falls upon any person every day?  No other way.  Or you risk being left without something very important.  Unfortunately, this is so, and it is difficult to argue with that. <br><br>  Learn to look for the positive in everything, even in the absence of something.  But do not strive to live without it.  Think about it as well. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/11724/">https://habr.com/ru/post/11724/</a></p>
