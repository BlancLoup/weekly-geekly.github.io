      In his article, Artyom Gobunov reveals a simple ‚Äúinternal and external rule‚Äù, which is a special case of the proximity theory.  A concrete example demonstrates how to calculate the vertical distance between the heading and the subtitle, as well as between them and the content of the page, so that all elements are not ‚Äúmixed into a mess‚Äù. <br><br><h4>  <a href="http://artgorbunov.ru/bb/soviet/20140224/">http://artgorbunov.ru/bb/soviet/20140224/</a> </h4><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><hr><br><br><h1>  How the preloader icon affects our attitude to the service </h1><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f7c/2d0/aa4/f7c2d0aa43cbf66ef7ff308dfc435f8a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  People really do not like to wait.  We can reduce their negative feeling not only by reducing the real waiting time, but also directly affecting their perception of time.  The animated preloader icon does just that, distracting the user's attention.  However, this does not always save, especially if the waiting time is too long. <br><br>  Rusty Mitchell talks about funny A / B testing, in which it turned out that if you use a custom preloader icon (as in the picture on the left), then the application itself will often be blamed for the delay.  If you use the system icon (as in the picture on the right), then the device itself, the phone itself, will often be blamed. <br><br><h4>  <a href="http://mercury.io/blog/the-psychology-of-waiting-loading-animations-and-facebook">http://mercury.io/blog/the-psychology-of-waiting-loading-animations-and-facebook</a> </h4><br><br><hr><br><br><h1>  The basics of responsive design </h1><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e9e/289/b45/e9e289b455b24e2f7972c1cdfea2be19.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  A simple step by step guide from Adam Kaplan on creating responsive design.  The article is addressed primarily to developers, but designers must understand the conceptual basis on which modern adaptive design is built.  In particular, it says what basic css values ‚Äã‚Äãyou need to put down.  That all content is divided into blocks (columns), which have predetermined proportions and indents.  The blocks themselves are grouped into larger independent containers (rows).  Etc. <br><br><h4>  <a href="http://www.adamkaplan.me/grid/">http://www.adamkaplan.me/grid/</a> </h4><br><br><hr><br><br><h1>  Using Photoshop Generator to create prototypes </h1><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a09/60b/288/a0960b2883d278a83cbb2848c2ef1ff6.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The relatively new feature of Photoshop "Photoshop Generator" allows you to save individual layers or their groups in pictures in .jpg, .gif and .png format in real time.  The idea is that now to get a web image you don‚Äôt need to copy, cut and export once again.  Once you set up a layer or group of layers, you can make the necessary changes to them, and the pictures will be automatically created. <br><br>  Courtney Star shares his experience on using this feature.  He says that when working with the client, they have to prepare the resulting PDF file every time on the basis of photoshop layouts, plus all the pictures are still duplicated with full-size PNG files.  For these purposes, "Photoshop Generator" is an indispensable tool. <br><br><h4>  <a href="http://savvyapps.com/blog/using-photoshop-generator-mockups/">http://savvyapps.com/blog/using-photoshop-generator-mockups/</a> </h4><br><br><hr><br><br><h1>  Yelp Style Guide </h1><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8b0/35d/862/8b035d862d22d95141a08d71b6c096a2.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Yelp.com is one of the largest services for finding local services (such as restaurants, hairdressers, schools, etc.), compiling their ratings and writing reviews.  He recently published his styleguide.  This was done in connection with the total redesign of the service.  To simplify the work on the new design, they decided to fundamentally abandon the old approach when the pages are being printed using photoshop layouts.  And before the start of development, they created a style guide.  Now it is enough to change the style in this document so that it spreads immediately throughout the entire service. <br><br>  The style guide serves as a common communication language for designers, productologists and developers.  The manual provides modularity of the development frontend, and also helps to maintain a single style in different parts of the service. <br><br><h4>  <a href="http://www.yelp.com/styleguide">http://www.yelp.com/styleguide</a> </h4><br><br><hr><br><br><h1>  Random user generator </h1><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d68/bc5/8e5/d68bc58e5d4d1cc3f846e72600b1421b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Free application for Photoshop, with which you can randomly generate people's faces and their names to use in their sketches and layouts.  The service also has a free API, with which you can build a generator into your own projects.  The service uses photographs of 1000 people distributed under a Creative Commons 2.0 license (not for commercial use). <br><br><h4>  <a href="http://randomuser.me/extension/">http://randomuser.me/extension/</a> </h4><br><br><hr><br><br><h1>  Peek service.

Its developers wanted a person to plan their time on the go (they have a whole video about it) to plan their time, and did not want to overload it with information and unnecessary functions. <br><br>  The developers decided to deeply explore how a person perceives and plans time.  And they developed their service from the very beginning, without resorting to the already established patterns and schemes.  For example, they realized that people do not perceive time in the form of tables or pages.  A much more natural time is perceived as a continuous stream (timeline) with a focus on the near future. <br><br><h4>  <a href="http://www.peekcalendar.com/">http://www.peekcalendar.com</a> </h4><br><br><hr><br><br><h1>  Iconfinder.

Currently, the service has a collection of 350 thousand icons.  For him, it is both pride and a curse.  Despite the fact that here you can always find icons for every taste, you need a good tool in this search.  And in the fifth version, the service offers us two new approaches to searching by its icons: through styles and through categories. <br><br><h4>  <a href="http://blog.iconfinder.com/introducing-version-5-prepare-to-be-inspired/">http://blog.iconfinder.com/introducing-version-5-prepare-to-be-inspired/</a> </h4><br><br><hr><br><br><h1>  New Ted.com 2.0 </h1><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5af/9b4/aa1/5af9b4aa118301588c7dcda1c2fdf8e6.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Ted.com presented a new design of their service.
