Journalists revel in fresh statistics and relish the details of the numerous "quarrels", the participants share memories of the "past nights" and interesting reports, they appoint mini-meetings - who share what they had time to hear, learn.  I myself will contribute my contribution to this noble cause - summing up the results.  As a participant, listener and idly loafing rifokibovets. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>The first day of the</b> conference was intense.  I know about it firsthand, for I arrived only on April 23.  Everyone knows about the fact that the event opened with D. Medvedev's video message, and the Minister walked about the exhibition too.  But about the fact that the dive in the framework of the performances turned into a brawl in the Pumba bar - the favorites.

      Buffet-eyewitnesses scolded, but on the whole, in disgusting voices, they said that the day was not bad.  Then I arrived.)) <br><br>  <b>April 23rd</b> .  It became sad because the registration did not give out a dandy blue handbag RIFOKIBa.  By 11 o'clock in the morning they, as explained, were already over.  Then his eyes began to pinch - the abundance of "soap" has done its job.  Rambler and Mail flooded literally everything.  Even on the shelf in the room, in the evening, a metal box was discovered in blue-orange colors - a gift from a mega-sponsor.  Although it had no effect on loyalty: the stylish handbag from Yandex and <a href="">Tangle</a> turned out to be dearer to the heart.  In general, as predicted, the ‚Äúthree buttons of the Runet‚Äù filled the space (and claimed the brain) of web developers. <br><br>  The first section, on which a person‚Äôs foot set foot (in this case, mine) was ‚ÄúNew in the advertisement of Runet‚Äù.  The event gathered more than 500 participants and 6 speakers.  You can read about the contradictions between A. Revazov and L. Glazer <a href="http://lenta.ru/articles/2009/04/27/slon/">here</a> .  Then there was lunch, a smoke break, new and not very familiar, a tour of the sections.  Movements across the territory of the Forest Districts were active, so the whole fragment of the speech that I had heard was the report of S. Kotyrev (umisoft) and D. Vasiliev (AIST).  I listened.  I realized that I think correctly and in a similar way I look at the situation. <br>  I watched the Synod for a long time: he asked so many questions, he was asked so much, he ran back and forth!  Already envy takes!  Therefore, with a sinking heart, she opened on Monday roem.ru.  What did he learn, what did he write?  Hmm, <a href="http://roem.ru/2009/04/23/revazov23042009/">expected</a> , but the atmosphere is very accurately conveyed. <br><br>  There was a section about maps and geoservices, they say, it was interesting to listen.  I do not know, I have not tried it.  It is known that A.Artischevu this section has benefited.  Many also awaited presentations on partnership with the regions.  I cannot say that there was a full house in the hall: it is difficult for the regions to get to the capital during the crisis, and the capital is somehow not up to the regions, apparently. <br><br>  Another noteworthy.  At the exhibition, each time with curiosity she passed by the stand of the ‚ÄúRussian Association of Electronic Communications‚Äù.  This is a ROCIT baby and for some reason passing by the leather chairs located on the stand (and for some reason almost always empty), there was a closeness of something obscure, dangerous.  Paranoia?  )) At the same exhibition, promotional girls were remarkable: as the cafe approached, the amount of clothing on their bodies kept decreasing.  At the entrance, Mail.ru girls were dressed in dresses, a little further, an unknown to me brand dressed slender nymphs in tight white suits with as many open spaces as possible.  Well, this alley was completed with a promo already known girl in blue. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6c8/b65/2dd/6c8b652dd4c2331a1d4a98cc896b41a6.jpg" alt="girl"><br><br>  Professional habit forced to collect a bunch of waste paper.  From interesting promotional materials - Gino flyer (hosting and domain registration).  It is from the series "Do it yourself" - cut, fold, get a table souvenir. <br><br>  Further dinner.  Well, the impressions of eating in the canteen are contradictory.  Someone told stories about the ‚Äúupset‚Äù stomach after a tasty dinner, and someone praised local cooks.  Nevertheless, the dinner took place and the most persistent went to the ‚ÄúRUPLING party‚Äù.  Shish kebab, beer, VIP-house for blue-blooded people, live music (they rehearsed Deep Purple and something else), and then again in the Pumba bar to light up - everything is as it should be.  Typical rest IT pros. <br><br>  <b>Last day</b>  Oddly enough, at 10 am the halls were full.  There were many people who wanted to join the beautiful and clever.  I listened almost to the end of the section of Leonid Nikolaev about retaining existing customers.  Speech A.Terehova (Rambler), perhaps, hooked the most.  After that, working days began - colleagues arrived, we must prepare for the report, understand the time and place ... <br><br>  People on this day were more serious or something.  They left little to smoke, mostly sat over a cup of coffee and in the halls.  From creative personal met with Yaroslav Bykhovsky (Intel), he presented his collection of poems "Poetic Liberties."  In fact, this is not quite a poem, but a free translation into Russian of the author‚Äôs favorite songs.  Here are a few lines that I especially like: <br><br>  <i>You turn on your spy satellite</i> <i><br></i>  <i>The infrared ray will find me in the night</i> <i><br></i>  <i>In war there is no smoke without fire</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Capture get me soon!</i> <i><br></i>  <i>You cracked my secret code,</i> <i><br></i>  <i>The virus launched - and killed the entry,</i> <i><br></i>  <i>I stole ciphers, I forgot my password,</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Almost in the pants are not imposed!</i> <br><br>  Guess what translation is this song?  Well, very incendiary, explosive motive. <br><br>  A collection of poems would have been much more liked if, by signing a copy, the author would not be mistaken in my name ... <br>  Later in the evening, an entertaining pause was arranged by Artischev for me: he talked about his ideas, he was amused by videos.  And then the hour came "X".  We, together with our partners, conducted a section.  From 19.00 to 21.00.  On the last day of the conference. <br><br>  Sadly, having seen big buses taking potential students to distant Moscow, we went to the gym.  Honestly, I expected the worst, but everything worked out.  People came to this dark, distant hall, asked questions, joked.  We talked about the transfer of business on-line, about development trends, presented a novelty for retail stores - Infokiosk.  And everything would be fine if the organizers did not decide to accompany us: behind a thin partition there was a discordant choir of aluminum structures.  Stands, advertising constructions were being sorted out ... well, they made it clear to us that ‚Äúyou, dear guests, have stayed.‚Äù <br><br>  Actually, this is exactly where the Joint Conference ended.  A curtain.  And effectively, under Tito &amp; Tarantula (After dark), we went to the capital.  Northern capital. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/58456/">https://habr.com/ru/post/58456/</a></p>
