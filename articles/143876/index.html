  <section class="page js-page"><h1>All books in one mobile application</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Today we will talk about one promising and convenient tool for accepting payments in mobile commerce - one-click payment directly from the mobile application.  And we will tell about it on a living example of the cooperation of our processing center with the company liters. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dbe/7de/149/dbe7de1491294e74ab281bd87399315d.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Liters is one of the founders of the electronic licensing books market in Russia.  1.5 million users from different countries of the world, who make more than 90,000 purchases, visit the liters site every month.  The market of electronic books in particular, and paid licensed digital content in general, is just beginning to take shape in our country.  Nevertheless, according to a study conducted by FOM (Public Opinion Foundation), today already 24% of Internet users in Russia are really ready to pay for viewing or downloading information.  The e-book market in Russia has been growing steadily over the past three years, at an average of 122% per year.  If such growth rates are maintained, the share of e-books will very soon (not later than 2015-2017) reach 5% of the entire book market and amount to about 3.0 billion rubles of turnover. <br>  In order to further motivate the user to acquire legal content (e-books), the LetRes team is working hard to improve the convenience of the content purchase process.  In the autumn of 2010, an opportunity to pay for purchases with bank cards appeared on the website of liters.  The company liters has developed mobile applications for the purchase and reading of books on devices running on Android, iOS and Windows Phone 7. At the same time, the opportunity was introduced to buy books using a bank card directly from the reader, without being linked to a desktop computer or laptop. <br>  Every year the share of customers using a bank card to pay for e-books has increased.  According to the statistics of ‚Äúliters‚Äù, in February 2012, 40% of buyers paid for purchases with a bank card, and this figure is constantly growing.  For the same period in February 2011, payment for purchases on liters by bank cards accounted for 29% of all available payment methods, and in February 2010 - 19%. <br>  Since the share of mobile applications in liters accounts for more than 20% of purchases, the company began to accept bank card payments not only on the site, but also through mobile apps, using the payment solution of the PayOnline processing center Pay-Mobile. <br>  But the development of the service did not stop there.  In order to improve the usability of mobile applications, the specialists of liters and PayOnline representatives analyzed the process of making a purchase payment in mobile applications. <br>  So, the process of making a purchase includes 3 main stages: the choice of purchase (Fig. 1 - 3), filling in the payment form (Fig. 4, 5), making a payment.  Only the first two stages concern the buyer directly.

Payment for purchases by credit card in the liters application</b> </td></tr></tbody></table><br><br>  The choice of purchase was made by the specialists of Letters to be as understandable as possible with the help of a convenient interface of the application, ease of search, a wide range of e-books, the use of several filtering technologies (by novelties, author, genre, book title, etc.)  After the customer has collected a ‚Äúbasket‚Äù of purchases, he is sent to the payment form. <br>  Previously, the payment form (for making payment by credit card) contained a large number of required fields.  In the course of optimization of the payment process, a part of the fields that are not critical for filling was removed from the payment form: ‚ÄúCountry‚Äù, ‚ÄúCity‚Äù, ‚ÄúTelephone‚Äù.  These data are not mandatory when buying a digital product of low price category, since the risk of fraudulent operations in this segment of e-commerce is practically reduced to zero.  In the new simplified form, only the most important fields remain: card number, expiration date, CVV, name and surname of the cardholder, email, bank name.  Thus, the balance of the minimum amount of information was observed, taking into account safety conditions. <br>  The main indicator confirming a high level of security is the compliance of the processing center, which ensures that payments are made, to the requirements of PCI DSS.  The PayOnline processing center confirms compliance with the requirements of the standard for the third year in a row and constantly improves the protection of cardholder data.  In 2011, the company's management made a decision on certification of the new version of the standard - and upon completion of the modernization of the information security management system of PayOnline, it was certified according to the version of PCI DSS 2.0. <br>  After the introduction of these changes, the payment process takes no more than 2 minutes.  But PayOnline and Liters experts went further: now the buyer of Lithuania, who once entered the data of his bank card, can agree to the terms of the offer and bind the bank card to his account.  With all subsequent purchases, the system will use information already available. <br>  In order to make the second and subsequent purchases, the buyer enters his account and makes a purchase by clicking on the ‚Äúbuy‚Äù button - that is, ‚Äúin one click‚Äù.  Withdrawals from a bank card are made only after the payment transaction has been confirmed by the buyer.  If desired, a client of liters can link several cards to your account. <br>  Separately, I would like to mention a technical solution that allows you to pay for books with a credit card directly from the "reader".  Pay-Mobile payment solution allows you to pay for purchases from devices that at first glance are not intended for payment transactions.  And we are sure that soon, computers, mobile devices and electronic books (from which you can make payments with bank cards in one click) will be followed by new technology carriers. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/143876/">https://habr.com/ru/post/143876/</a></p>
