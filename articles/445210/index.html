      - Meir spoke in an abstract and rather calm tone, as if he was not at all worried about this question. <br><br>  - and all?  Is that all she said?  Yes, as much as possible already, they seem to mock us.  We got to keep in constant ignorance.  Seriously, Meir, these working females do not consider us as ants at all, behave arrogantly and, probably, perceive us as some kind of raw material, as if we were twigs or food. <br><br>  - Calm down, Yafit.  Do you really care what they think of you? <br><br>  - Yes, I do not care about these barren females.  Only our girls are important to me.  How are they good.  Have you seen their wings?  They are wonderful.  It seems to me that these wings are the most beautiful thing in the world.  My life will be meaningless if I get only a couple of leaves from this tree.  Do you understand? <br><br>  Meir was still in thought, and he practically did not hear the words of his interlocutor.  He was good to Yafit, but his words sounded like the same broken record that sounds from every guy in the colony.  He has already got used to not focusing on all this talk about females, praising their wings and so on.  Yafita was distinguished only by the fact that it was possible to communicate with him about something else. <br><br>  - Hey, Meir, are you even here? <br><br>  ‚ÄúYes, yes, I'm here,‚Äù he answered, still detached. <br><br>  - What are you thinking about?  You look like you saw a bird. <br><br>  - Yes, so ... I am trying to realize everything I have learned lately. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  - And what is it?  Are you telling me something? <br><br>  ‚ÄúWhere to start ... well, when I went to ask about the mating flight, as you requested, I managed to overhear the queen's conversation with some other females ...‚Äù <br><br>  - You saw her?  The guys say, few people are familiar with her - with his inherent temper, Yafit continued to chatter. <br><br>  - No, I did not see her ... In general, it seems to me that our queen is a little mad. <br><br>  - In terms of?  - Yafit was even outraged by such audacity towards the queen. <br><br>  ‚ÄúShe calls everyone strangely.‚Äù  I call myself a blockchain, girls either investors or users, I did not understand.  And we are called ... ICO.  What is it all about? <br><br>  - I do not know this.  But I'm sure that I will be the best ICO in the world.  Colonies need the same active and aggressive ants, like me.  And then there will be a lot of lazy people, there will be no one to equip and protect the house. <br><br>  ‚ÄúWhy are you so sure they care what you are?‚Äù  Maybe we all will participate in marital flight? <br><br>  - Meir-Meir, don't make me laugh.  Of course, we can all go together and fly, but the girls are not so stupid as to pay attention to everyone.  They will choose only decent ones like me.  Look at how many unremarkable guys in our colony.  They do not differ from each other.  Sometimes I do not even understand how they are still alive at all.  Not that we are with you.  We are the foundation of the colony and future generations. <br><br>  - I do not want to upset you, but in general, the basis of the colony - working females.  Without them, there would be no our house, there would be no infrastructure, there would not be all these paths that we walk with you;  no one would bring food or feed the queen;  no one would court ants-babies;  no one would protect our colony from other ants and other creatures - they all do it.  We only enjoy the fruits of their labors. <br><br>  - Yes, but without us there will be no new ants.  That we are interesting girls.  We, not all of these workers.  I somehow even pretended to be one of them to make sure of that.  I tried to imitate work, but our winged beauties did not even look in my direction.  Therefore, I am sure that only thanks to us the colony will become stronger. <br><br>  ‚ÄúWhy don't you say how the others reacted?‚Äù  - Meiru wanted to return a friend to the ground.  - Yafit, everyone laughed at you and your attempts to be like someone.  More precisely at the beginning they laughed, and then they did not let me do something ... something you tried to do there. <br><br>  - I thought to carry a pebble - Yafit offendedly corrected the interlocutor and was clearly not happy with this attitude. <br><br>  - No, you're well done, really well done.  You at least tried, though pursuing your own goals. <br><br>  Meir did not want to upset Yafit, but only to take away the crown from his head, which in itself was a little upset.  Meir decided to take a short pause so that Yafit would cool down a bit.  But then he decided to continue, because he felt that once he had begun to talk about all this, he needed to finish the job to the end. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThere is one more thing ...‚Äù Meir began somehow uncertainly, as if he wanted to prepare a friend for something more unpleasant. <br><br>  - What else?  Still something overheard from the words of the queen?  Or, again, will you protect your dear friends, who don't care about your attitude towards them? <br><br>  - Yes, I do not defend ... - Meir became thoughtful and realized that he did not have to make excuses and continued his initial thought.  - In short, I spoke with one of the foragers.  Well, you understand, one of those who carry food to babies ... <br><br>  - Well, so what, how quickly she sent you, so as not to interfere?  - Yafit did not even try to hide the sting of his words. <br><br>  - Not the point ... In general, I wanted to ask her why the workers have such a scornful attitude towards us, towards the ICO, towards the males, call it what you like. <br><br>  - Yes, they are barren because, here and rage, business then.  - Yafit did not let up. <br>  Meir tried not to pay attention to this bold attack and told the story, as if nothing had happened. <br><br>  - She said that we are for them as guests.  They come, do their ‚Äúguest‚Äù business and leave.  And that's all.  In the house they do not stay, do not take care of them.  The main thing is to behave normally at a party. <br><br>  - Some kind of turbidity ... <br><br>  - That's not all.  I asked her how they feel about the queen and if everything was alright with her.  Do you know what she answered? <br><br>  - What? <br><br>  - That the queen is not the main one, although everyone probably thinks the opposite, as, indeed, we are with you. <br><br>  - How is it not the main?  She is a queen, without her there would be no our colony and all these ants.  - Yafit‚Äôs indignation went up a couple more degrees. <br><br>  - She said that the management of the colony is actually in the legs of the working ants.  They treat the queen as a milking aphid, which maintains the size of the colony, therefore they constantly provide her with food and guards. <br><br>  - What makes you think that all that this forage food said is true?  Maybe she's mocking you and laughing right now somewhere.  Meir, don't be so naive.  And in general, even if this is true, why should she tell all this, especially to you? <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe mating flight ...‚Äù Meir replied in dismay. <br><br>  - What is mating flight?  - in the words of Yafit appeared notes of fear. <br><br>  - I feel before the marriage flight there is not too much time left, so she told me. <br><br>  - I still do not understand what does the mating flight. <br><br>  Meir hesitated a little, not knowing how to say better. <br><br>  ‚ÄúOkay, how do you think the mating flight will take place?‚Äù <br><br>  - It's easy.  We will fly along with the girls and zatusim with them.  I think each of us would like to go with the greatest number of winged beauties ... <br><br>  - Well, then what? <br><br>  ‚ÄúUm ... I don't know, I was only thinking about the mating flight.‚Äù  Probably continue to hang out with the girls. <br><br>  - Yes, we'll die later, Yafit. <br><br>  Meir felt that he could no longer soften the blow from his words, so he decided that it was better to say it as it is.  Yafit was numb and did not understand how to react. <br><br>  - How do we die?  We are only a couple of weeks away from strength.  The rest of the ants have been out for several months or even years, and the queen is even more. <br><br>  - These are all working ants, Yafit.  Tell me, have you seen at least one ant-man who lived a couple of years?  At least one guy who returned from the mating flight and told how everything went cool?  I think not, did not see.  I also did not see or hear about them.  Do you know why?  I think because they do not exist.  After the mating flight, we will no longer need.  No one.  Neither these girls-investors-users, because after they get everything they need from us, they will fly away.  We don't need colonies either, because we are not workers, we are drones.  We do not bring anything new to the colony, but only use what we have.  And by themselves, we will not survive, you know? <br><br>  Fear is even more enveloped Yafita.  He began to remember all the males that he had met in his entire short life, and among them there really was not a single old man.  Could Meir be right after the beautiful moment that he had been waiting for so long, would such a sad end follow?  He did not want to believe it, but he saw that the friend was not joking and was himself in a broken state from such news.  Whether to thank the forage for the fact that she revealed to them the truth to which they themselves would come in time, or to hate and be angry with her?  Yafit did not know. <br><br>  - What do we do?  Do not fly for a mating flight?  - finally able to utter Yafit. <br><br>  - I do not know ... I think we should fly.  What else is left?  We don't know anything else.  We will do our ‚Äúguest‚Äù business and leave.  Maybe we will be so good that we will be invited again.  We'll see.  We can only be sure that the next generation, which we will breed, will be better and will live longer. <br><br>  - Yes, I think you're right ... Well, let's have some fun for the last? <br><br>  - flew. <br><br>  <i>Note of indefinite importance: I am not an ants expert.</i>  <i>Basically, there are patterns of behavior that are inherent in ants, but a couple refer only to cryptomir.</i>  <i>I only hope that my crazy metaphors are quite understandable.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>And one more thing: I was warned that the style of art. Lit is not particularly in high esteem on Habr√©, like the theme of the crypt.</i>  <i>It was interesting to combine these things and check this statement.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/445210/">https://habr.com/ru/post/445210/</a></p>
