  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Clone Wars or how to attract talents</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I want to talk about that ‚Äúimage of the employer‚Äù.  We have been at the bank for the last two months (with the help of one large consulting company) working on a project on this topic.  A large team of several dozen experts solved an almost unsolvable task: ‚ÄúHow to make the bank as attractive as possible for the so-called‚Äú digital talents ‚Äù?‚Äù. <br><br>  As a result, a set of ideas and initiatives emerged, the implementation of which should help us significantly in achieving this goal.  If we can change and become even steeper in the eyes of the candidates, it depends on whether we succeed in accomplishing everything planned.  So follow us, there will be a lot of changes. <br><br>  But today I want to share with you my thoughts about hiring and retaining people.

What is really important to him?  How to interest him?  The answer to these questions is the key to success. <br><br>  A quick online search led me to <a href="https://vc.ru/13598-inbound-recruitment">an article by</a> Darya Khokhlova, head of marketing for Spice Recruitment.  Here is her opinion on the topic (although I advise you to read the whole article): <br><br>  So what do developers care about? <br><br><ul><li>  Programmers like to solve technical problems. </li><li>  Programmers like to work with very smart people. </li><li>  Programmers like to look very smart. </li><li>  Programmers like to do open-source projects. </li></ul><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/mc/of/-z/mcof-zbiprnrqp8dgod5rb_wdf8.png" width="600"></div><br>  Darya's opinion is one of many, there are a lot of versions on the topic ‚ÄúWhat do developers / testers / admins want (underline the necessary)‚Äù.  It seems to me that you can already shoot the second part of the famous film with Mel Gibson, replacing the word "women" in the title with "developers".  Success will be assured. <br><br>  I remember how I got involved in Raiffeisenbank myself.  Frankly, he was a very unattractive employer.  HR suited me a hell of a stress interview, the office sucked, the company's strategy is unclear.  At that time, it was important for me to prove to myself that I am capable of changing something in such an environment. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/hy/nk/db/hynkdb03rfbk6zsbirxk5ldqmie.jpeg" width="350"></div><br><br>  It turns out that my motivation basically came from a negative image of an employer?  That is, I was looking for something that I call a ‚Äúnon-northern task‚Äù, and the bank was fully fit.  ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs one politics‚Äù, ‚Äúthere‚Äôs boring and no dynamics‚Äù, ‚Äúeverything‚Äôs outdated there, you‚Äôll be delayed by this swamp‚Äù bank.  But in fact, it is all very provoking and creates an atmosphere in which you want to prove even more to yourself and everyone around that nothing is impossible.  And my experience of the last 5 years has shown that I was right. <br><br>  I read job descriptions for engineering positions in different banks.  Now everyone is trying to describe the position, goals, objectives, format of work in the most lively and ‚Äúhumane‚Äù way.  I think that in a year the situation will even out and all large banks will have approximately the same ‚Äúnyashny‚Äù job description format.  It turns out that the situation as a whole will not differ from that when all banks had boring and dry descriptions?  For the candidate, everything will be the same. <br><br>  And if you dig deeper, then all the banks will repeat one after the other.  Cool open space office?  Everyone tries to make it in a different form (ordering from the same designers, so often in the offices of different companies, even carpets are the same).  Normal salaries to engineers?  All this is already understood and sooner or later the market will normalize.  Interesting tasks?  Plus or minus banks dig in one direction. <br><br>  Yes, someone makes a slightly greater emphasis on innovation, someone faster than others managed to switch to new technologies, but in the future in a few years this will even out. <br><br>  And do not forget about another idea, which has long been exaggerated in different communities - about averaging the composition and level of services, and therefore the banks themselves.  If the client ceases to distinguish the difference, then the companies gradually become absolutely identical guides of standardized services. <br><br>  You know, even the slogans of the companies are almost the same.  Even <a href="http://www.lookatme.ru/flow/posts/reklama-radar/60387-20-par-do-boli-pohozhih-drug-na-druga-logotipov">logos</a> . <br><br>  What then is the differentiator?  What distinguishes or should distinguish us from other banks in the eyes of candidates? <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/tr/xo/qt/trxoqt6pnxx4y7s56m3be2f5rv0.png" height="300"></div><br>  My answer: a hiring manager.  I sincerely believe that the role / words / behavior of the hiring manager cannot be fully copied, and the decision of the candidate directly depends on them. <br><br>  When I settled in Rife, I had another offer, from a rich oil company, with an office in the Kremlin area and interesting buns. <br><br>  I came to the interview and saw the future manager, who mumbled something like ‚Äúdbrdn‚Äù into the phone with his head.  Five minutes I waited, then asked: ‚ÄúMaybe I should tell something?‚Äù He, without raising his eyes, replied - well, there‚Äôs a flipchart in the corner, draw a business process X. I honestly drew - the dude never raised his eyes from the phone .  And the whole further ‚Äúconversation‚Äù came down to the fact that he showed his detachment and non-involvement in every way. <br><br>  And at the interview in Raiffeisen, I saw an interest, people listened to me, vividly and directly talked about their problems and expectations.  The comrades who hired me were open, they looked into my eyes and did not ask me to draw unnecessary squares on flipcharts.  Shared doubts.  It was interesting with them, and in the end this was the final argument in the decision.  And of course, I understood that in the bank, with a high probability, I was not waiting for anything cool, and it was clear that, on the whole, the fears of friends also have a basis, but at that moment something clicked in my head and I realized that it made sense to risk .  And I still think that the choice was right.  And I am very clearly aware of the role of the hiring manager in this story. <br><br>  Therefore, in the long run, any company that is fighting for talent needs to grow the competence of hiring staff as one of the key ones.  And when everything around will be similar, when logos and offices begin to merge in the eyes of the candidate, then it is the behavior of the hiring manager at the interview that will be the key difference. <br><br>  What is your opinion? <br><br>  Stay tuned! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/344710/">https://habr.com/ru/post/344710/</a></p>
