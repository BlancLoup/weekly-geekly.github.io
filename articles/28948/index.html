Strictly restricted sign for use in domain names - roughly speaking, 26 <a name="habracut"></a>  Latin uppercase letters, 10 Arabic numerals and a hyphen.  Latin (askishnaya) point is used as a separator nodes of the hierarchy.  All other alphabets of the world are not represented, that is, they are discriminated.  Let me remind you that the Unicode standard was published <u>sixteen years ago</u> .

      2. A strictly limited set of top-level domains (TLDs) - two-letter geographic plus a handful of historical com-net-org, .mil exclusively for the US military, .nato for it internationally, .edu for (American!) Educational institutions.  All other countries must be established under their geographical domain, that is, they are discriminated.  At the beginning of the century a handful was added, such as .info, .mobi, .travel, and similarly, for supposedly specialized services.  All of them, one hundred percent, are formed from <u>English</u> transcription, and some are also from distorted, like .biz.  Other languages ‚Äã‚Äãare not represented once, that is, they are discriminated. <br><br>  3. Thanks to the driving force of progress, that is, the bubble, a purely squatted domain .eu was created, which broke the last order of the order in this system, that is, the reservation of two-letter domains only for countries and for nothing else.  Two-letter domains somehow met the ISO 3166 standard, and now it has been lost.  If a newly emerged country receives an EU code, it will not be able to get its domain because it is busy.  Comments are not needed. <br><br>  4. Due to the artificial restriction on top-level domains, some domains of some countries became much more popular than others, due to <u>completely arbitrary and random reasons</u> , like the harmoniousness of an ISO code in the desired language (cc, to, nu, cx, fm, tv, md and so on), or free registration (tk).  I already wrote here about this phenomenon, look for Tokelau. <br><br>  5. Due to the desire of localization, companies are forced to register a new domain in each country where they conduct business (google.com, google.fr, google.it, and so on 82 times).  Pretty often there is a conflict with the already registered legitimate domains in these countries.  This leads to many years of tedious litigation and confusion for users.  Squatters are crawling.  In the same example: gmail.de could not be sued, gmail.pl was occupied for a very long time: Grupa M≈Çodych Artyst√≥w i Literat√≥w existed long before Google‚Äôs postal service. <br><br>  6. Approval of wild and absurd applications for TLDs, like .cat and .bzh for propaganda of <u>Catalan</u> and <u>Breton</u> languages, respectively.  Have you heard of these?  Dieub ha par en o dellezegezh hag o gwirio√π eo ganet an holl dud.  But the matter is progressive (see above), because applications are supported by six-digit tranches.  How many of you believe that the sonorous domain .cat is really used for the prosperity of the culture of the surroundings of the glorious city of Barcelona? <br><br>  7. Forced disappearance from the network of domains whose TLD has ceased to exist for reasons independent of them.  This refers to the states that have died in the Bose, and the names that have been brought up in the .cz, .su, and .yu zones.  My country can cease to exist, or so it is called, or I can move, and the TLD begins to be a false entity that has been imposed on me, and can bring down my essence. <br><br>  8. The actual dilution of the existing two-tier system into a flat one: the .com TLD means practically nothing in our time, it does not communicate either the attitude towards commerce or the United States.  This is well illustrated by the behavior of many browsers, which, when you enter a single word in the address string, by default try to attach behind the ".com". <br><br><h1>  Decision </h1><br>  1. Allow the use of any Unicode characters in the names, with the following restrictions. <br><br>  you can use only alphanumeric characters (of any alphabet and any numbers); <br>  within the name, it is possible to use symbols of one, and only one alphabet, to exclude the variants ‚ÄúMicrosoft‚Äù with the Cyrillic ‚Äúo‚Äù or ‚Äúc‚Äù.  By alphabet we mean ‚Äúscript‚Äù in unicode. <br>  punctuation is prohibited so that there is no temptation to use something like a dot to be misleading. <br>  It is necessary to keep the existing system of reduction to one register, in those alphabets where the register is different.  It is unlikely that anyone would distinguish between .gibd and i.HIBDD. <br><br>  2. Allow the registration of any top-level domains.  What ICANN has now done is a progressive step (test word: loot), in the sense of potential superprofits of the registrars and the office itself, but the tendency, nevertheless, must be relied upon to be correct.  It will take several years, and the said six-figure TLD contributions will be four and three digits, and over time and unequivocal, like .com, this is an inevitable process.  The temptation to register .mycompany and get ahead of all possible Mycompany Ltd, Mycompany GmbH, Mycompany OY, Mycompany szoo in any countries will be too great. <br><br><h1>  Difficulties </h1><br>  Technical no: a small extension of the DNS protocol.  Logistic, too, because this system does not cancel the previous one, but complements it.  As for the inconvenience of non-Latin (Russian, Chinese, etc.) domains, there is one simple consideration - the market.  If it is convenient, companies will register.  And if customers find it inconvenient, they will not, that's all.  No one forces you to move from an existing .com or .ru.  The only problem, the solution of which I do not see, is a question of ownership in relation to the top-level domain.  Perhaps, dear readers will share their thoughts on this issue. <br><br>  <strong>UPD I</strong> : special thanks for the collapse of karma after this, and after all my recent articles.  I know that an independent position is not honored. <br><br>  <strong>UPD II</strong> : A hot discussion has begun on whether it is good to have domains in Unicode or not.  I remind you that domains in unicode (‚Äúinternational‚Äù) have been resolved in many registries for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalized_domain_name">many years</a> by hacking through the unicode reduction of unicode (‚Äúpyunicode‚Äù), and thousands of Chinese, Russian, Arab, Swedish and other domains of the SECOND level have long been registered. <br><br>  All I suggested was to show consistency, and to allow the same at the FIRST level, that is, the TLD.  The details of the implementation (leave as is, that is, pyunicode, or bring everything to UTF-8 encoding) are not so important. <br><br>  <strong>UPD III</strong> : Added items 7 and 8. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/28948/">https://habr.com/ru/post/28948/</a></p>
