In short - it was very cool - well, a little more detail - under the cut <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  First of all, I would like to say a huge thank you to the organizers - despite the fact that (as I understand it) the organization of conferences is not their main occupation and everything was done practically with complete ‚Äúenthusiasm‚Äù - everything was organized very well - registration, Internet, equipment for speeches ... well, in general, everything was at a very high level, there is nothing to complain about. <br><br>  Well, maybe it would be possible to put them in the minus the lack of a chill-out - so that you could sit and relax, but there was no time to sit around with such a <a href="http://jeeconf.com/program/">set of reports</a> - everyone just ran from the hall to the hall and burst if two reports came across on which I want to go (judging at least by myself).  By the way, especially for such cases, video shooting was carried out everywhere - so that all the reports can be viewed later - and if it didn‚Äôt work for some of them - no problem. <br><br>  According to the reports - from what came out on his own: <br>  1. Claus Ibsen - the main developer of <a href="http://camel.apache.org/">Apache Camel</a> - the presentation was essentially introductory and not very deep (well, can you manage in 50 minutes?) - but I have at least my head kept up as to Camel and ServiceMix, how else can Camel be used - well, it was nice to talk already after the performance - for example, it turned out that FuseSource (in which Claus is working) is already working on integrating with <a href="http://activiti.org/">Activiti</a> - which we are also working on ( <a href="http://www.emforge.net/web/activiti-liferay/wiki/-/wiki/Main/BPMN%2B2.0%2Bfor%2BLiferay%2Bwith%2Busing%2BActiviti%2BPlugin">Integration with Liferay</a> ) - in general, there was something to simply talk about <br>  2. Then I had almost two hours of my report on Liferay.  There were relatively few listeners (compared to other presentations) - but it turned out to be ‚Äúhomemade‚Äù - since most of them were already working on developing for Liferay, it‚Äôs rather not a presentation that came out - but an interest club.  Well what happened to get together in the framework of JEEConf - it was nice to see people you already know from communication on the Internet. <br>  3. <a href="http://jeeconf.com/speakers">Eugene Kompaniets</a> spoke about the experience of a specific, rather large project implemented on Groovy plus GWT.  On the merits (first of all, the speed of development), on the shortcomings (first of all, the speed of work) and their solutions.  It is very useful to see how things are in real life and not in some advertising brochures. <br>  4. Then I went to <a href="http://jeeconf.com/speakers">Pavel Yaskevich‚Äôs presentation</a> ‚Äú <a href="http://jeeconf.com/program/">Cassandra as a distributed NoSQL database</a> ‚Äù, but since I‚Äôm not really confronted with NoSQL now, the report was far from introductory, I didn‚Äôt understand anything.  But judging by the number of questions and discussions - for those who are "in the subject line" was useful.

      It is generally necessary to say here that, as it was stated, the level of reports was calculated more for Senior Developer, that is, there were no ‚Äúsimple‚Äù reports.  Nobody talked about some "basics" - rather about the nuances, features, real cases of application or what special "chips". <br><br>  5. Just Dejan Bosanac (Apache ActiveMQ developer) did not begin to grovel for a long time what it is - and so most of the people in the hall knew ActiveMQ or used it.  His report was more devoted to the use of ActiveMQ complex cases, with examples of vertical and horizontal scaling, etc. In general, such ‚ÄúAdvanced ActiveMQ‚Äù <br>  6. Alex Snaps from Terracota simply blew my brain - I realized that I don‚Äôt know anything about using EhCache and caching at all :) <br><br>  Well, then there was the presentation of prizes.  To be honest, laughter over prizes in the form of ‚Äúe-books‚Äù has touched a little ‚Äî there‚Äôs nothing to laugh at ‚Äî but I won‚Äôt be annoying ‚Äî this is a topic for a separate article.  And the main thing to defeat the Galaxy Tab was lit - although well done - he said the right things. <br><br>  At the end of the beer - where without him and free communication.  Well, yes, Kiev - although it was almost impossible to watch it - but what it saw confirms - Kiev in May is beautiful! <br><br>  As a summary.  I can safely say - at least for Kiev residents - well, and probably for all Ukrainian Java developers - must visit.  Next year I will try to visit - if not the speaker - at least as a listener - it's worth it. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/119806/">https://habr.com/ru/post/119806/</a></p>
