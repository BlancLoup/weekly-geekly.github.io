      <u>Denis Maltsev</u> : ‚ÄúSpace Rangers‚Äù is a complex, complex sandbox game with no plot lines, but with limitless possibilities for playing the character‚Äôs character.  There are few such games.  This is both a virtue and a problem.  The modern player is more inclined to the rails and pre-registered character.  However, there are players who prefer to create their own universe.  Gave peace, gave introductory, gave the rules - then he himself. <br><br>  <i>- Why KR: Legacy only for mobile devices?</i>  <i>How to be fans of KR2HD?</i>  <i>M., they do not interest you?</i>  <i>How do you present the target audience of the Heritage?</i> <br><br>  <u>Denis Maltsev</u> : On the contrary, we believe that fans of the Kyrgyz Republic also have mobile devices.  I, as a player, always wanted to play full-fledged deep games on the tablet.  This is a great gaming platform that does not require a chair, table, keyboard, mouse, monitor, and so on. <br><br>  ‚ÄúLegacy‚Äù we address both old players and new audiences.  First of all, of course, lovers of space and freedom of expression in the game. <br><br>  <i>- What will happen to KRK?</i>  <i>And why is the price of KRK equal to the price of KR2HD - after all, in KRK only text quests, KR2HD looks much more significant?</i> <br><br>  <u>Denis Maltsev</u> : The price of a product has no direct relation to the amount of content.  The game "Space Rangers: Quest" is a kind of trial ball, designed to evaluate the audience's reaction to the brand and the game world.  The series has not been updated for a long time, and we decided to start small. <br><br>  <i>- Will there be a high score table and a celebrity table for Heritage?</i> <br><br>  <u>Denis Maltsev</u> : It will, but perhaps not immediately. <br><br>  <i>- Are championships and legacy quizzes possible like KR2HD?</i> <br><br>  <u>Denis Maltsev</u> : This type of championship will definitely not work.  But the idea is clear, let's take it into development. <br><br>  <i>- Why did you refuse the services of SNK during the creation of the Heritage?</i> <br><br>  <u>Denis Maltsev</u> : SNK is a great team, but for none of its participants, gamedev is not the main occupation.  A product of this scale requires the full-time daily employment of many specialists, otherwise the development will take years.  SNK advised us on various issues (however, I do not shift responsibility for decisions to them, decisions and implementation are ours). <br><br>  <i>- What are the reasons for such a radical change in the graphic style (the look of the bearing has changed, magnificent forms of heroines have appeared, emblems of races have changed, etc.)?</i>  <i>Does this not contradict the established concept of the CD?</i>  <i>Are such sexy heroines appropriate for children 12+ or will there be another age limit?</i> <i><br></i> <br>  <u>Alexey Vakhrushev</u> : The original game was released in 2004.  Since then, more than twelve years have passed.  During this time, the canons and traditions in modern games have undergone significant changes.  What used to seem interesting and attractive sometimes looks strange by modern standards. <br><br>  Our task, in addition to the careful transfer of the universe of the Kyrgyz Republic to mobile platforms, was to update the artistic part of the game in accordance with the new trends. <br><br>  In place of the old sprite ships came three-dimensional.  Developed a huge amount of visual effects.  Now the shots and hits of each weapon can be visually distinguished from each other. <br><br>  Explosions in space, for example, depend on the race of the deceased ship and look diverse and, in some places, simply amazing, compared to what it was before. <br><br>  Scenes with characters on space stations and planets have become fully three-dimensional.  Each character looks unique and has its own character.  In his own way responds to your phrases and actions. <br><br>  Of course, we could not ignore the appearance of the characters.  We tried to focus on the individual traits of each race in order to make the characters even more interesting and memorable. <br><br>  As for the sexuality of girls, it is rather a curtsey towards a more adult audience, but all strictly within the framework of decency. <br><br>  As you know, there was almost no place for female characters in the original game: we tried to correct this omission.  Therefore, in the updated version of the game girls will be significantly more. <br><br>  <i>- From time to time, different games are criticized for excessive violence in the game world, is there such a problem for the CD?</i> <br><br>  <u>Denis Maltsev</u> : Well, what kind of violence in Kyrgyzstan?  Space combat, lasers, rockets, ships explode.  We have no violence! <br><br>  <i>- Will there be continuity with the previous games of the KR series and will there be any plot changes that bring sharpness to the familiar game universe?</i> <br><br>  <u>Denis Maltsev</u> : There has never been a plot as such in the CD, the player has always created the plot himself, based on the introductory ones.  This feature of the game we intend to save.  Perhaps, in one of the additions, third-party plotlines will appear that are not directly related to the main task. <br><br>  <i>- Will attention be paid to humor in the game?</i>  <i>By the way: Microsoft is not offended by 1C for jokes in the game to your address?</i> <i><br></i> <br>  <u>Denis Maltsev</u> : Humor in the game is either there or not.  The writing staff has changed several times since the release of the first Rangers, but the humor has not gone away.  We also try to keep some amount of humor.  About Microsoft, like no one asked them, but they did not put forward any complaints.  No, no one has revoked our Windows and Office licenses. <br><br>  <i>- Why choose the f2p scheme?</i> <br><br>  <u>Denis Maltsev</u> : Free-to-play is a progressive distribution model that allows the player to try the product without paying for it.  Now this model is so developed that the only paywall of a paid product - buying a game in a store - repels 90% of the audience.  And we hope to expand the audience. <br><br>  <i>- Is Steam suitable for games targeting mobile devices?</i> <br><br>  <u>Denis Maltsev</u> : Steam is suitable for any games.  And ‚Äútargeting mobile devices‚Äù is a very vague phrase.  We make a full game with deep gameplay, not a clicker. <br><br>  <i>- Will there be Steam chips for Heritage, as in 2HD: 82 achievements, the number of hours in the game, a showcase?</i> <br><br>  <u>Denis Maltsev</u> : Achievements will be (how much is difficult to say, the game will expand).  The number of hours in the game do not count. <br><br>  <i>- Will support KP2HD?</i>  <i>Or m.</i>  <i>what rich fan Buratino can you buy the rights to it as useless on the cheap?</i>  <i>Then - how much?</i> <i><br></i> <br>  <u>Denis Maltsev</u> : We do not plan to withdraw the game from the stores. <br><br>  <i>- KP3 will do?</i> <br><br>  <u>Denis Maltsev</u> : Follow the news! <br><br>  <i>- Thanks for the answers and for the screen shown at the beginning of this part!</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/317098/">https://habr.com/ru/post/317098/</a></p>
