It can be attributed to the trend of the current - a startup.  I think at the heart of any startup is IDEA.  To this we have approached thoroughly.  Our team was attended by people from different fields of activity (designer, programmer, computer seller), which allowed us to look at the system from different angles.  After quite a long discussion, a clear view of the system was drawn up. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Domain </h4><br>  The first thing we decided to do is invent a domain name.  Good domain names associated with bookkeeping were already taken.  And to be honest, most of them had little to do with accounting.  After a rather serious brainstorming, it was decided to dwell on the name of BILLS.  Here you can interpret this name in two versions: as a bill from the accounting arsenal and as Accounts - a speaking Russian surname. <br>  The domain name <a href="http://www.schetov.ru/">schetov.ru</a> was registered, hosting is also ready for the project.

    <h4>  Printing of documents </h4><br>  One of the stages of project development was to organize the printing of documents and save them in PDF format.  Previously, we did not have to do this functionality.  We decided to start the study with this.  It turned out all pretty simple.  A good TCPDF project was found that allowed to get a final unicode PDF document with a relatively small file size.  In our opinion, this is a good indicator compared to other services on the Internet, which are quite a few. <br><br>  Since this functionality was completely ready and could be applied to any standard accounting documents, it was decided to kill two birds with one stone.  We decided to make an online form website - free generation of basic accounting documents (invoice, invoice, sales, etc).  This allowed in the future, simply in the right place of the main system, to add an already ready generation of the desired form. <br><br>  There is a lot of services for filling and generating documents of strict reporting on the Internet, and here we didn‚Äôt count on anything.  But despite this, one simple page was made on the main site <a href="http://www.schetov.ru/">schetov.ru</a> .  There was an opportunity to select the desired form and in a new window fill it in and print it out or save it as a PDF document.  Pages with free forms gradually began to rise in search results and we had regular visitors, who with enviable consistency came to our website through bookmarks (li statistics). <br><br>  So the site of free forms worked, and we in due time passed to development of the main system. <br><br><h4>  Main system </h4><br>  <a href="https://ssl.schetov.ru/">The main system was</a> developed in a completely different style.  Standard javascript libraries (jquery and command) were used to display the site interface.  The advantages are obvious: it was necessary to write less code, and the interface turned out to be as close as possible to standard accounting systems. <br><br>  Another important moment of the system is that the data transfer is encrypted using SSL.  RapidSSL certificate (not self-signed), for which a couple of boxes in beer currency were paid 8). <br>  Also on the side of the hoster organized the possibility of delimiting user databases.  That is, personal databases are created for our clients, independent of each other and not in any way in contact with each other. <br><br><h4>  Video </h4><br>  We suggest that you familiarize yourself with the system by viewing a small video.  The video was recorded by us, our voice is a talisman and the muse of one of the system developers.  If you plan to record such videos yourself and have never done this, then stock up on nerves.  Specially purchased a program for recording video Jing.  Of the advantages of this program, it can be noted: the ease of recording and the small size of the final video.  But there are also disadvantages: even in the paid version we managed to record a video with a maximum of 5 minutes.  To edit the video, we tried the program from this office, but the work was not stuck with it.  There are other programs, but they are very expensive (Sony Vegas was enough for Trial). <br><iframe src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://player.vimeo.com/video/10261096&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhgQ1KRPKTEspmk7oMJZirNpdqR2Og" width="514" height="315" frameborder="0" title="Introduction to schetov.ru" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h4>  Plans </h4><br>  Pretty many plans.  From the nearest: make it possible to install the system locally on a computer or on a web server with the ability to integrate with your system (for example, an online store).  The ability to save documents in popular graphic formats.  Add new documents to fill. <br><br><h4>  And finally </h4><br>  Especially active testers, with real proposals and reasoned criticism, are a lifetime license for our commercial product. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/88603/">https://habr.com/ru/post/88603/</a></p>
