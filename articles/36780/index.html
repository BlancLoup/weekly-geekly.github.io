  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Let's talk How to save the nerves of the interlocutor.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><h3>  Introduction </h3><br>  I think it is not a secret to anyone that people in IT professions have difficulty mastering the language.  No% username%, this does not apply to you, that you.  BUT?  Yes, because you tell me now in the comments that you tell me, will not find it.  So I doubt that the person who is able to write <i>such</i> is a problem with speech. <br>  I ask you to classify all of the above with jokes (although you know what we have about jokes and truth), and let's get closer to the body. <br><a name="habracut"></a>  Sorry, to the topic of conversation. <br><br><h4>  The essence </h4><br>  No, by the way, I did not mean that there is an n-th number of people who do not know how to talk at all.  Although I knew one pepper.  For more than 2 years of acquaintance - the first time I heard his voice after a year and a half at corporate party.  As you probably guessed, it was heavily under a degree.  And all this did not prevent him from being quite a programmer. <br>  So gentlemen, however trite it may sound - <b>you need to learn to express your thoughts clearly.</b>  This is the first step to ensure that the source did not start throwing shoes at you.  Before you say something - thoughtfully raise your eyes to the top, speak mentally the phrase, and then meaningfully and weightily say it out loud. <br>  Let you better consider as a brake than an idiot.  + The manager / customer sees that he has torn you off about thoughts about the fate of the project <s>world</s> , and in general.  It's good. <br><br><h4>  The very essence </h4><br>  Actually for the sake of what all this was written. <br>  Rule: <i>Never, never, never say "I know exactly what ..." if you are not 99.9% sure.</i>  <i>Better not say so at all.</i> <br>  Rule 2: <i>If a person bears a frank heresy - depending on the situation and your relationship - or say, ‚ÄúI think that you are mistaken,‚Äù or keep silence if you see this person not so often that it irritates you.</i> <br>  That's all.

    <h3>  And now an example from life </h3>  . <br>  I work with two people.  <i>In general, retreating a little to the side, it must be said that 80% of men in Russia consider themselves to be not recognized as geniuses. From my personal observations of the author - his comment)</i> Both are my good comrades.  I know one for more than 13 years, the second is about 6. But when discussing any problems, they just <b>put</b> me <b>out of myself !!!</b>  .  Actually about the extremes mentioned above. <br>  One of them constantly makes postulates - from which I want to run away to kill myself against the wall.  For example: "A normal computer in less than 40k cannot be assembled" or "I know that it is impossible to impose this way."  And all this is said in an iron tone, and the second phrase sounded especially unpleasant, because  the person at that time was looking at an example of the implementation of an ‚Äúimpossible‚Äù layout.  And since my man is a very close friend, I have already told him a million times that it is not necessary to do this, but alas.  <i>Please respect the opinions of others, and try not to speak in the tone of "fool himself."</i>  <i>It is possible that you are in an uncomfortable position.</i> <br>  The second case is even more radical, and embarrassing your interlocutor. <br>  I give an example.  I heard something about my ear somewhere <i>(unfortunately I couldn‚Äôt remember a real case, lately</i> I‚Äôm <i>talking a little with this person ...)</i> .  So.  Let's take for example some kind of false information.  "You know, I heard somewhere that the prototype weighs less than jquery, and it works more brightly."  And here the person simply explodes, starts sprinkling with saliva, and shouting to the whole Ivanovskaya that I am an idiot, I don‚Äôt shuffle, and in general I have to be a complete idiot, so that this could even occur to me, and generally 5 months ago he threw me into a jabber a reference to a 40 page article in which a general comparison of these libraries was made, and in general.  No, I understand, a person does not work anywhere, does nothing - stays at home, drinks beer, and digests tons of news from all that is possible.  But some of them work in two jobs and study full-time, in one of the most ambush faculties.  (Sorry boiling over) <br>  I'm all for what.  Yes, actually all the same.  <i>If you see that the interviewee is wrong - tell him about it gently.</i>  You can offend him, and some may just give a face.  =). <br>  Something like that. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/36780/">https://habr.com/ru/post/36780/</a></p>
