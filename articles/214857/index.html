I like my work and I want to do it well, but so far it turns out, frankly, not very. <br>  There are lots of interesting ways to learn how to make it better. <br><br><h4>  And what are the options? </h4><br>  The first, but not the best way is to <a href="http://software-testing.ru/blogs">read blogs</a> . <br>  As always, a much more useful thing is <a href="http://software-testing.ru/books">books</a> . <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">You are of course interested in my opinion of them.</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><ul><li>  Kaner, Software Testing - <i>Mastrid for a Tester of Products Living for More than a Couple of Years</i> </li><li>  Culbertson, Rapid Testing - <i>Not at all Rapid, but Still Testing</i> </li><li>  Myers, The Art of Testing Programs - <i>see Quick Testing</i> </li><li>  Whittaker How to test in Google - a <i>really good book book about the right mood and attitude to work</i> </li><li>  Dustin, Automated Software Testing - <i>if you are serious about automation</i> </li><li>  Beizer, Testing the black box - <i>raise your hands, who read to the end and understand everything?</i>  <i>Nevertheless, there is a mass of useful</i> </li><li>  Messarosh, xunit Test Patterns - <i>if you're dealing with code, then Mastrid.</i>  <i>If you do not want to deal with the code, then all the more</i> </li><li>  Kaner, Lessons Learned in Software Testing - <i>in my opinion, the best book about testing</i> </li><li>  Savin dot-com testing is the <i>starter kit of any tester.</i>  <i>It is a pity, but they often forget that this set is exactly the starting one and if after a couple of years of work the set has not changed it is very sad</i> </li><li>  Kaner, The Domain Testing Workbook - <i>in my opinion, the world's first testing guide</i> </li><li>  Black; Key testing processes - <i>tediousness and I do not believe that this happens</i> </li><li>  Tamre, An introduction to software testing is <i>tedious, but I believe that this is exactly what happens.</i> </li><li>  Crispin, Flexible Testing - <i>together we repeat the mantra "and we are happy!"</i> </li></ul></div></div><br>  Numerous online courses, webinars and master classes of varying degrees of usefulness, from the purely harmful to the incredibly useful, follow the line of books.  It all depends not so much on the topic, but on your relationship and the name of the particular presenter. <br><br>  The most effective way to learn is practice.  Even better - practice on different projects.  Very good - practice on different projects with more experienced colleagues.  Yes, in general - communication with them. <br>  But there is a problem: it‚Äôs almost impossible for a tester to work on a new project, and not even a solo <i>(there is a <a href="http://www.utest.com/">utest</a> for working alone)</i> without changing the place of work.

      Stand alone conference. <br>  I would not call them an option of learning, rather it is a pleasant way of knowing the world around and finding out - what else should I learn, how does everything work there with people?  With the right attitude, utility is incredible. <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">I want to tell a story about this very proper attitude.</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  On SQA days, my employer carefully sent me and several colleagues, and everything was perceived as a holiday and a movie to be shown to us.  But once I had to pay most of it personally and go alone.  And everything just changed. <br>  The motivation to pull out all useful knowledge from the speakers is enormous, not a single couloir was left unvisited, not a single narrator was left without a question.  The absence of a number of colleagues - a powerful impetus to make new acquaintances.  Personal requirements for reports also grow up - one feels the need to recapture every ruble spent. <br>  Correct attitude to the conference is when you know exactly with whom and what you would like to talk about, what to learn.  Reports are a reason for conversation, for further work. </div></div><br>  Testers in the CIS have quite a few conferences.  SQA Days for all, Selenium Camp for adherents of automation through the interface, with a dozen smaller events.  Happy cities where there were initiative people who created communities. <br>  In Yekaterinburg, testers with conferences are a serious problem. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Dump </h4><br>  <i>- We need to get over the abyss in small steps,</i> - we thought and tried to integrate into the existing event. <br>  For several years, one of the few local <a href="http://dump-it.ru/">DUMP</a> conferences has been <a href="http://dump-it.ru/">held in the Urals</a> .  Testers have not been represented at it before, but this year <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/it_people/">it-people</a> - Julia and Elena suggested creating a testing section.  That is, to take and just to find interesting topics for conversation and interesting people who have something to tell. <br>  I called friends, they liked the idea and we rushed. <br><br>  I strongly recommend everyone to engage in such volunteering.  The benefits are mass. <br>  First, you will automatically attend the conference. <br>  Secondly, you will get a lot of communication with the speakers, the opportunity to ask any number of questions and find out the whole story.  You can even go on a tour. <br>  Thirdly, the ability to select reports, speakers and topics for conversation. <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">By the way, I suggested these speakers:</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><ul><li>  architecture of automation, what needs to be done, and in no case, assessment of terms, proper interaction with developers and programmers, what and how to test and not test automatically </li><li>  place of manual testing in the development cycle - how not to increase the time </li><li>  effective testing without a tester - organizational and technical ways </li><li>  organization and conduct of alpha and beta test </li><li>  how to deal with bug driven development </li></ul></div></div><br>  However, you will not strangle the song and you will not kill, each story-teller has his own favorite theme.  Only one of the suggested ones was taken by Natalya Rukol <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/natalyarukol/" class="user_link">natalyarukol</a> , for which she is a special thank you very much.  Nevertheless, the volunteer has the opportunity to influence the result.  As a result, each section's story is interesting and relevant for me. <br><br>  At first it was a bit scary. <br>  I know every third speaker from neighboring sections personally.  All - practice.  Who does not teach at the university, the leader of the community or the creator of the framework. <br>  And here we are with testing. <br>  But then it was thought that all the program speakers around were very smart guys.  But we - testers - for some reason, anyway.  No matter how clever programmers are.  So it will be interesting and we have something to talk about. <br><br><h4>  Speakers </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/74d/795/204/74d795204c612cff47af66533fd35ca3.png" align="left"><br>  Alexander Akhmetov will describe how life works without testers.  I fully support this idea in spite of the fact that he himself contradicted it for several years - he was engaged in testing automation, not being a programmer. <br><br>  Andrei Khitrin will talk about the agony of choosing a testing system framework.  I asked him to bring a laptop with an IDE, so that after the story it could be shown to those who want it, how it all works. <br><br>  Yana Sadovskaya will tell how she answered the eternal questions of testers: <br>  <i>- We finally raise another stand?</i>  <i>What rolled out on this stand?</i>  <i>How is it, not enough iron?</i> <br><br>  Mikhail Mikryukov will try, not in general terms, but in terms of numbers and facts, to describe what kind of benefit the tester has done in a single online store, to trace the history from the moment when there was no testing at all, until the moment when testers are already a group. <br><br>  Tanya Cheremnykh tried to create a tool that helps in a difficult situation when the programmer says: <br>  <i>- I refactored CoreMagicGUIClass there, poke it, nothing broke?</i> <br>  She is a decent person and writes tools, but does not begin to swear <i>(I would</i> swear <i>)</i> . <br><br>  Ilya Vakhrushev <s>went from hand to hand</s> as an outsourcer-tester-automation and managed in this role to visit various projects, and he will tell us how to use outsourcers correctly. <br><br>  And, as I said, Natalya Rukol will talk about how testing lives completely without testers. <br><br><h4>  Hopes and dreams </h4><br>  I hope, the section will turn out not absolutely normal.  Through it, the refrain - the first and last report - will pass the idea that the correct tester as the correct interface is missing, but his work is being done. <br><br>  Senior comrades suggested to me that the testing section should have some idea.  it should sound something other than the general words: "quality", "regression" and "planning." <br><br>  I would like us to find out what the manual tester should and can do, except and in addition to direct trampling. <br>  I would like my friends to tell me - and then on the sidelines talk to the guests about a specific job that can be done by a tester-specialist at the company and from which there will be no harm, and there will be a definite benefit. <br>  I would like to see you as test and development specialists and argue with you about all this. <br>  <a href="http://dump-it.ru/">Come.</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/214857/">https://habr.com/ru/post/214857/</a></p>
