      <i>Video Review</i> <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/UOfRc9LSYUs%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700255&amp;usg=ALkJrhgjJMF7pmmBRcqCDbofWJs8gZkXiw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <i>Text review</i> <br><br>  The prefix officially went on sale on July 31, although it was originally planned to begin deliveries on the 27th of the same month.  Nvidia explained this by the fact that there were minor mechanical problems with one of the suppliers. <br><br>  In addition, on the shelves of stores, Shield appeared at a price of $ 300, and Nvidia wanted to sell it at a price of $ 350.  <i>But we are from this only better.</i> <br><br>  Now mobile console is available only in the USA and Canada.  I think that the manufacturer "tests" the markets, studying the demand.  Perhaps the prefix will appear soon in Russia, as the first sales results were very good.  Dzen-Sun Juan, executive director of Nvidia, noted that sales of the console are excellent - everything that Nvidia delivered during the first stage was sold. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/acd/9bc/e16/acd9bce16dd8accd8b2735617b7a5659.png"><br><br>  First of all, the ‚Äúcoolness‚Äù of the console catches the eye.  Shield is very well made and assembled. <br><br>  Externally, it resembles the Xbox joystick, although its structure is similar to the PlayStation: D-Pad gamepad on the left, the game buttons on the right, at the bottom are two sticks.  At the end of a pair of additional game buttons. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/de9/9c5/784/de99c5784b6642764e6ec8d3051b447d.png"><br><br>  Top metal plate is easily removed.  It is magnetically and can be replaced. <br><br>  <b>Technical characteristics of Nvidia Shield</b> <br><br>  - Android 4.2.1 (Stock) <br>  - Tegra 4, 4 cores, 1.9 GHz <br>  - Graphics: 72-core GeForce <br>  - IPS-display 5 'with a resolution of 1280x720, 294 ppi <br>  - 2 GB RAM <br>  - 16 GB internal memory <br>  - MicroSD support up to 64 GB <br>  - mini HDMI connector <br>  - GPS <br>  - Battery capacity 7350 mAh <br><br>  You already understood that this device is a really powerful thing.  This is confirmed by tests: <br><br>  <b>AnTuTu</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/eb9/7ae/a91/eb97aea912b5d8fe08533e42eedeff53.png"><br><br>  <b>Geekbench 2</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/54f/a77/f41/54fa77f41fa0539befb6e7e671c1ba5c.png"><br><br>  The main feature of Shield is the ability to play PC games with high-quality streaming and instant feedback. <br><br>  But in order for your computer to "pull", you need at least a GeForce GTX 650 or GeForce GTX 660M for a laptop, an Intel Core i5 processor, 4 GB of RAM, and Windows 7. This is the minimum.  By the way, AMD support is also present. <br><br>  How it works? <br><br>  First you need to download <a href="http://www.nvidia.ru/geforce-experience/">Nvidia GeForce Experience</a> to your computer.  In general, this is a program for debugging drivers, so for many GeForce users, it has long been installed.  Everything works automatically, now all you need is to connect PC and Shield to one Wi-Fi network and connect to a computer on the console.  This is done in a special program, from which you will eventually run the game. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3fd/169/f72/3fd169f72cbf8aa8f2a541b71127d6c3.jpg"><br><br>  The great thing is that before starting any of the games you don‚Äôt need to adjust or press something.  You don‚Äôt even need to touch the computer - you turn on Shield and use it to start the game.  Naturally, as Steam is supported, it can also be controlled from the console. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/85a/130/dd7/85a130dd7ddb3975a7ffc75bdb2a4e32.png"><br><br>  Surprisingly, everything works perfectly.  Only a drop in the quality of the video is visible, but Belkin PlayMax is the most disgusting router in the world (I don‚Äôt buy it for anything!), So this is quite justified. <br><br>  Watching Crysis 3 graphics on such a small HD display - you realize that mobile games still need time to ‚Äúgrow‚Äù.  Besides, playing with buttons and sticks is really convenient.  Do not be surprised at my conclusions, I just do not play games at all, but even me, ‚Äúanti-gamers,‚Äù this thing struck. <br><br>  Shield has a very capacious battery - 7350 mAh, Nvidia has promised 24 hours of video playback.  I was not able to verify this, although two days of intensive use with games and Wi-Fi set the device from 100% to 30%. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c99/7d9/bc8/c997d9bc81a8ab8ffc6ec4a2f8f41089.png"><br><br>  The main question is whether it is a finished product?  The product is uniquely ready and ready to ‚Äúwork and defense‚Äù.  The only thing that can confuse is the support of a small number of games [ <a href="http://shield.nvidia.com/play-pc-games/">list</a> ].  In addition, the program checks almost all games for authenticity, and for many it is also a problem. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/eed/d5b/c53/eedd5bc53406beaeac571039518b63d1.png"><br><br>  Another factor for sadness is the lack of a front-facing camera.  She really wouldn't hurt ... <br><br>  But in general, the device leaves a super-positive impression.  I even wanted to buy, but I know that for me it is for a couple of weeks.  Nvidia Shield, I think, is waiting for the future.  It is still ‚Äúfoggy‚Äù, but if Qualcomm, Apple or Samsung do not present another revolutionary processor and video core during the year, then Shield will definitely take its place. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4ca/106/ba5/4ca106ba59c13618d319c4313e9fc174.png"><br><br>  The conclusion that playing PC games while sitting in the toilet is a good way to kill time - the right one.  Although in childhood this could be compensated for by reading the journals ‚ÄúScience and Life‚Äù. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/190932/">https://habr.com/ru/post/190932/</a></p>
