      <b>System objectives</b> <b><br></b> <br>  The objectives of the system are the realization of the direct power of the people in the country, the creation of a mechanism for interaction of citizens with the legislative power, ensuring control over the actions of the executive branch, ensuring public control over the adoption of all state decisions, and improving the electoral system. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Structure</b> <b><br></b> <br>  The system consists of sections: <br><br><ul><li>  Petitions </li><li>  Discussions </li><li>  Referendums </li><li>  Elections </li><li>  Testing </li></ul><br>  <b>Petitions</b> <br><br><ul><li>  Any citizen of the country can create a personal or collective appeal to the authorities, submit a local or state petition using the section "Petitions". </li><li>  Any petition can discuss and support citizens. </li><li>  All petitions that have gained a threshold number of votes are mandatory sent to the special committee of the OGAS ministry, which prepares material on the basis of the petition for transmission to parliament or the executive authorities. </li><li>  Such petitions should receive a substantiated response from the executive authorities or become the basis for the preparation of a new bill by Parliament or amending existing laws. </li></ul><br>  <b>Discussions</b> <br><br><ul><li>  In the "Discussions" section there is a nationwide discussion of draft laws that are considered in the country's parliament. </li><li>  All citizens can make comments, propose amendments on the text of draft laws that are under discussion. </li><li>  Artificial intelligence algorithms should select the most significant amendments proposed by citizens and pass them on to parliament. </li><li>  Parliamentarians are obliged to accept for consideration the amendments of citizens and take them into account when preparing bills. </li><li>  The final decision on the text of the bill is made by the Parliament.  The bill must be approved by parliament and signed by the main state.  But in order for the bill to become law, it must also be approved by a national referendum.  This will guarantee a combination of a professional approach to lawmaking and taking into account the interests of the majority of citizens. </li></ul><br>  <b>Referendums</b> <br><br><ul><li>  Any citizen has the right to vote in a nationwide electronic referendum using the functionality provided by the system. </li><li>  All bills that passed 3 readings in parliament and signed by the head of state are submitted to nationwide electronic referenda. </li><li>  Questions prepared by local authorities are submitted to regional or local referendums. </li><li>  If the bill is not approved at a national referendum, it is rejected or sent back for revision. </li><li>  All citizens of the country who have confirmed their ability to use the voting system and have passed special specialized tests confirming their competence in the field to which this bill applies (for example, Economy, Finance, Ecology) can take part in an electronic referendum. </li><li>  The tests are prepared by the Ministry of OGAS.  Tests can be completed electronically.  Successful passing by the citizen of the test opens for him the opportunity to vote on all referendums in this area. </li><li>  Citizens can vote in referendums on their own, or they can transfer their vote on any topic of the referendum to any other citizen of the country who, in their opinion, is more competent in these matters.  You can voice your voice in different topics to different people. </li><li>  If a citizen passed his vote on this topic to another person, then he cannot vote in a referendum on this topic, and the person to whom he passed the vote has already voted by 2 votes. </li><li>  If citizen A gave his vote to citizen B, and he, in turn, passed his vote to citizen C, then citizen C votes in 3 votes. </li><li>  Citizens vote in electronic form using an EDS key, which guarantees reliable identification of a citizen‚Äôs identity.  Reinforced qualified electronic signature should be used, ensuring the highest possible security and legal validity of the electronic signature. </li><li>  Electronic voting is secret. </li><li>  Technologies such as the blockchain can be used to eliminate possible vote fraud ‚Äî every citizen gets a hash of his vote, a hash of votes and a hash of all votes after a vote, which allows to check the correctness of each vote and the accuracy of the results of the vote. </li><li>  After the end of the referendum, the results of the referendum are processed by software and publicly announced in electronic form. </li><li>  If the bill is adopted by a majority of votes (or according to another principle, if it is provided for by the terms of the referendum), it becomes law and then goes on to implement the law in a special Commission for the implementation of laws in the OGAS Technical Service Center. </li><li>  The Commission on the implementation of laws is preparing terms of reference for the implementation of this law in the electronic system OGAS. </li><li>  The technical task is performed by creating new software modules of the OGAS system, software algorithms, software "patches" that change the logic, algorithms of the electronic system and affect the operation of one or more subsystems of the OGAS system. </li><li>  The terms of reference for this draft law, as well as the list of ‚Äúpatches‚Äù with the source codes of ‚Äúpatches‚Äù, are laid out on the OGAS website in a form open for reading, for public control.  All citizens of the country can verify that the law is programmed exactly as it was formulated in the text of the bill. </li><li>  From this point on, the law becomes part of the algorithm of the electronic system and its effect applies to all citizens and all enterprises of the country in an automatic mode.  No official can influence his execution, cannot violate it or use it for his personal benefit. </li><li>  All citizens of the country will be able to control how the implementation of this law was implemented at the program level and if the law is programmed incorrectly, inaccurately or incompletely, they can appeal to the Commission for the implementation of laws. </li><li>  The commission is obliged to consider the appeal and if the comments of citizens are fair - it makes changes to the previously applied ‚Äúpatches‚Äù and these changes are also laid out in the open. </li><li>  The number of referendums is not limited, they can be held daily, by several referendums per day. </li><li>  If a citizen has the right to vote on the referendum topic, but is not willing or unable to do so at the moment for any reason (he works, rests, is ill, etc.) he can pass his vote to any other person (relative, friend, colleague, deputy, etc.). </li><li>  Thus, the vote of each will be taken into account, even if he did not directly participate in the voting. </li><li>  Getting feedback from citizens on any legislative issues will allow every day to better tune the work of the electronic system, to make it more and more compliant with the wishes and requirements of the citizens of the country. </li></ul><br>  <b>Elections</b> <br><br><ul><li>  The elective subsystem allows for electronic elections to the authorities at any level - from local to national, right up to the election of the head of state. </li><li>  The subsystem allows you to familiarize yourself with the biography and program of each candidate, to discuss his activities and achievements.  Allows you to evaluate each candidate "by deeds." </li><li>  Elections are held on the subsystem's website in electronic form within the time limits established by law. </li><li>  According to the results of electronic elections, the winning candidate is appointed to an elective office for a specified period. </li><li>  Additional functionality of the section - ratings of officials, accounting of declared and executed promises of officials, collection of citizens' comments on the work of officials, recall of officials from their post. </li><li>  If the rating of an official is very low, a lot of complaints about his work - the election subsystem should provide the ability to recall an elected person from office. </li><li>  To recall, you must submit a revocation petition, collect the required number of votes and vote on the recall.  If the majority of those who appointed him will vote for the recall, the official will be removed from his post before the end of his term. </li></ul><br>  <b>Testing</b> <br><br><ul><li>  Due to the fact that the introduction of the OGAS 2.0 system implies a transition of the state management system to the principles of democracy and key decisions with the participation of all citizens of the country, it is necessary to make sure that every citizen who participates in referendums is highly literate and responsible. </li><li>  Since the referendums will be imposed complex and important issues affecting the livelihoods of the whole country, every citizen must prove their competence on the issues on which referenda are held. </li><li> To do this, he needs to complete training courses and pass profile tests on each basic referendum topic. </li><li>  Training courses and tests are prepared by the staff of the Ministry of OGAS.  Training courses and tests are conducted online. </li><li>  Tests should cover the most important, essential questions on the topics on which referendums are held. </li><li>  If a citizen has successfully passed a profile test - he gets the opportunity to vote in all referendums on this topic. </li><li>  Tests can be re-taken after a certain time. </li><li>  Profile tests should improve the quality of the results of all conducted electronic referenda, reduce the number of poorly considered, random votes.  To increase the responsibility of every citizen for every vote he left.  What ultimately should improve the quality of all adopted national decisions. </li></ul><br>  <b>Summary</b> <br><br><ul><li>  The election and referendum subsystem should make the entire political system of the country more balanced, flexible and in line with the interests of the majority of citizens.  It will allow realizing in the country real, not declarative power of the people, when all key decisions affecting the life of every citizen of the country will be approved by nation-wide referendums, and appointments of officials of any rank will be held by nation-wide electronic elections. </li><li>  Transparency, openness of the electronic system of power will give every citizen confidence that his opinion will be heard, that his interests will be taken into account when making the most important state decisions. </li><li>  Integrated feedback systems will give society control over the country's state system.  Do not allow officials to abuse their powers.  Will help the work of political and social elevators. </li></ul><br>  Links to other parts: <br><br>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/454488/">Part 1</a> &gt;&gt; <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/455696/">Part 2</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/455924/">https://habr.com/ru/post/455924/</a></p>
