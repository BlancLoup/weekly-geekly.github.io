  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Online game based on real estate data</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  What was first? <br>  There were initial designs for appraising apartments.  They concluded to derive some formula in which you enter the parameters known to all, and the cost is calculated.  Such 10 years were developed and did not find practical application in any way.  And the articles were written scientific and all in vain. <br>  Then there was another regular diploma on this topic, and it also seemed to be in vain, and the story could end there or continue with a description of scientific activity, if it were not for an accidental coincidence of circumstances!  The author of the diploma was lucky to get into an organization that conducts a mass assessment of real estate in Russia and find out how all this is calculated by the state.  The presumptuous author dreams of fame, he begins to offer his models, his designs, to which the author is told that we already have everything, this is right and is not discussed. <br>  Then the author begins to give up and forget about the thought of practical application of research.  And a miracle happens, the author meets a person with a thousand ideas in his head.  They decide to come up with an alternative to what the system has invented - simple and clear for everyone.  The alternative is to create a virtual world similar to the real one in real estate.  We decided to create an online game in which users will sell-buy apartments based on the real market and real prices.  And the prices will be calculated on the basis of the models mentioned at the beginning. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Why will it be interesting?</b> <br>  1. A person always wants to know how much his current or future apartment costs - so why should he climb all the sites with ads, estimate something, when you can score known parameters and get a price. <br>  2. A person always wants to know what could have happened if, sometime in the distant past, he had done this and that.  The game and this question can give an answer, though not immediately - you buy a virtual apartment and watch what would have happened with the price in a month or six months and you are happy about the right decision.  Of course, it is possible that then a person would think that it was necessary to buy all the same then not a virtual, but a real apartment, would be a millionaire now, but in this one can also find advantages - a person to learn to trust his intuition. <br><br>  <b>What is the game built on?</b> <br>  1. We collect a database from all available open online sources daily, because  Market prices may vary daily (especially during the season). <br>  2. On the basis of the database obtained in the game, valuation models are updated, meaningful and insignificant parameters are identified. <br>  3. Users sell and buy virtual real estate, equip it. <br><br>  <b>How do we want to make money on it?</b> <br>  1. Sell the very system of searching and creating a database to analysts who are now collecting databases manually. <br>  2. Sell virtual money and bonuses in an online game.  They provide additional opportunities for development in the virtual market.  Basic operations (purchase and sale, rent) are available with initial capital (equal to the average salary for the year in the city).  Additional operations (available upon subscription) are: <br>  <i>operations with commercial real estate, equipping offices and apartments, repairs aimed at improving the apartment / office and the subsequent sale for a higher price.</i> <br>  3. Providing real companies with virtual stores where you can buy tools to improve real estate.  That is, the user, besides buying apartments at real prices, can buy interior items or make repairs with prices taken from specific stores in the city.  People get virtual reality, sellers - advertising, we - a little money.

      <b>"Yes, you will not succeed"</b> <br>  The one who does nothing is not mistaken.  The project with the appraisal of apartments is clear to us now, because we have been dealing with the topic for a long time, if you wish, you can redo it and finish it to the needs of the market.  We do not expect a quick result, we are ready for a long-term project that will change to the needs of people. <br><br>  We welcome reviews, comments and ANY criticism </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/125610/">https://habr.com/ru/post/125610/</a></p>
