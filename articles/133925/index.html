But despite this, the deed was done and named <a href="http://www.drebedengi.ru/%3Fmodule%3DforumTopicList%26id%3D7">Best Things 2.0</a> .  Since then, for several months now the base of voting on a wide variety of things has been replenished by people in real time.

      About some interesting conclusions from the resulting popular vote and will be discussed. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  The essence of the service </h4><br>  Service helps to solve the problem of choosing simple things that often arise in everyday life.  For example, what kind of bed linen to buy, so that it does not decrease one and a half times after washing?  Where and which is better to take tomatoes, what would be without chemicals and fresher?  What beer is better, etc. <br><br>  On reflection, we came to the conclusion that the moment of fixing the flow, i.e.  Shopping is quite successful to leave a review.  And then we took statistics for several years (more than 9 million transactions), made a list of things relevant for comparison, and for each of them we made a separate page on which the user can: <br><ul><li>  Leave your vote for one of the varieties of things </li><li>  Add a new variety </li><li>  Show on the map of your city a place where it is better to buy </li><li>  Comment on your vote or someone's opinion </li></ul>  For some things, the comparison is actually carried out only in the selected region (perhaps Baltika beer in St. Petersburg is not at all the same as in Vladik).  While on other things (iPhone phone, Philips iron) it is useful for completeness to hold a general vote in all regions.  This was taken into account. <br><br><h4>  First conclusions </h4><br>  It was best to reflect on simple things that we rarely think about.  For example: <br><ul><li>  The best cigarettes.  What b you thought?  People choose the option - "all cigarettes feces."  Fashion smoking still passes.  I thought, recalling personal observations of recent years ... there is a steady feeling that 80% of those smokers I have met / seen / know are women.  It is worth thinking. </li><li>  Zhigulevskoe beer (bar) is not bad!  I also tried Hoegaarden for the first time, which stands out in the lead vote - I was satisfied and added my own plus sign. </li><li>  The fears were confirmed that voting for the series ‚Äúfor the best car‚Äù would have little sense ... there after a while dozens of options accumulated, with a small number of votes in each.  However, there is some benefit.  For example, we can conclude that Outlander XL, which I like, is quite a popular one. </li><li>  Surprisingly, the ‚Äúbest condoms‚Äù are being actively discussed.  It would seem that there to discuss? </li><li>  Wrist watches have not sunk into oblivion with the advent of mobile phones, etc. ... Young people who know a lot about them and vote for some sophisticated options are not so few. </li><li>  Discovered gas from BP.  Previously, he didn‚Äôt pay much attention, according to the habit of TNK, but then he saw that people choose ‚Äúsome kind of BP‚Äù.  Once I decided to try it - since then I have only been a cold one.  Fuel consumption fell from 11-10l, to 8-9.  The difference is palpable, and the engine is better. </li></ul>  I hope you can make some useful conclusions for yourself.  See, comment, share ideas, what else can you do for good? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/133925/">https://habr.com/ru/post/133925/</a></p>
