  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Half a kilometer rechargeable lantern</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Sometimes it happens that you find yourself in a bad place with poor lighting, which is not enough to solve an unforeseen problem.  As a rule, only a camera flash built into a smartphone can help you.  But all this is very sad, since the flashlight of the smartphone can see the maximum of your shoes or a cigarette butt within a radius of 5 meters.  In addition, it happened more than once when in a car garage somewhere in the outback of the city the lights were turned off in the whole cooperative and you stay in complete darkness, but you need to come to a logical conclusion - to repair the car and leave, or just go outside and ask for help.  And in general, the street lighting of our beloved country leaves much to be desired, even in large towns and cities. <br><br>  I also took the SX25L2 XM-L2 Rechargeable Flashlight XM-L2 from Eagletac to help me.  This American company produces professional flashlights.  Most of which are tactical and used by police officers in their work. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1c4/6ec/c55/1c46ecc553fbfe15677a75c1108c9bfe.jpg">

      As the name implies, the lantern is rechargeable and you are not afraid that the batteries will die and you will have to look for them somewhere and run somewhere.  The flashlight includes the XM-L U2 LED of cool white light and has four levels of brightness in normal mode and 4 in tactical, 4 SOS signals and emergency warnings, as well as 3 stroboscope modes.  I will say right away that after three seconds of operation of the stroboscope it becomes bad, therefore this type of lamp work can be used as a certain means of self-defense. <br><br>  It is worth noting that the lamp is IPX-8 dust and water proof and is waterproof and can work up to 10 hours at a depth of 2 meters. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The packaging of the device is quite practical and compact. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/93e/4cf/4dd/93e4cf4dd14225a05445efa9516334c4.jpg"><br><br>  The package includes: <br><br>  1. The lantern itself. <br>  2. Instruction manual. <br>  3. Two rings for fixing grip. <br>  4. Charging with an American plug. <br>  5. Additional cap to hide the charging point. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a7d/02f/aad/a7d02faad55c8bbf6bc4c3472fc5db2e.jpg"><br><br>  It looks like a disassembled flashlight with battery. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/61c/55c/cab/61c55ccab7c39d324e22e59f9f8523f5.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The lantern is felt in the hand rather weighty, and even if in the dark time you have to fight back from the bullies, then you can stand up for yourself. <br><br>  The luminous flux is 1305-1159 / 636/120/10 Lumen and 1305-1159 / 200 Lumen in tactical modes.  If we consider that the luminous flux is counting from the base of the lamp and has an area of ‚Äã‚Äãapproximately 5 cm2, then we obtain an illumination level of 26,100 Lux at the beginning of its path.  This is very, very much, if we accept the fact that the normal level of illumination is 400-500 Lux.  Due to such a powerful luminous flux, the range is up to 498 meters! <br><br>  Charging location is as follows.  After charging, a stub is screwed into this place, which sits next to it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8a2/cca/beb/8a2ccabeb0ddcb7b18a33c496ea90eca.jpg"><br><br>  The operating time of this device is already more than 200 hours of work, depending on the mode or up to 3 hours at the maximum brightness level, provided that the replaceable R33 battery included in the package is used.  The power of this monster comes from two 26650 batteries (not included) or a R33 lithium-ion battery at 4500 mAh / 33.3 HF (included).  I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs true or not, but with active intermittent use, the flashlight has been working for a week without a hint of charging. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b0a/418/aa9/b0a418aa985fde39774560a24f119d65.jpg"><br><br>  The lamp dimensions are 240 √ó 47 √ó 31 mm and weighs 280 grams (without battery) or about 700 grams in their original packaging. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cda/1f9/210/cda1f9210dd9356e3be0b2fb5c8cb357.jpg"><br><br>  The cost of this lamp is $ 149 on the official website of <a href="http://www.eagletac.com/">Eagletac</a> and can be ordered to Russia with the help of a favorite intermediary.  I personally ordered it on Amazon.com at an identical price and used a very popular forwarder in a tax-free state to deliver to Russia along with other goods.  It should be noted that when filling in the declaration, it is necessary to avoid writing the word tactical, since it may be of interest to customs officers, and weapons in any form, as we know, cannot be sent. <br><br>  In conclusion, I would like to note that I really liked this lamp, but you need to understand that the lamp is primarily intended to search for some key places or things that are at a considerable distance from the place of use, to search for lost gold rings or other small items - it is recommended to take a flashlight of another model. <br><br>  UPD: Added a photo in a disassembled state </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/204330/">https://habr.com/ru/post/204330/</a></p>
