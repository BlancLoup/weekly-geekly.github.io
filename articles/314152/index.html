  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What to tell about the company to get feedback from the developers (checklist)</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Especially for the <a href="http://moikrug.ru/">‚ÄúMy Circle‚Äù</a> blog <a href="http://moikrug.ru/">,</a> IT recruiters from the <a href="http://digitalhr.ru/">DigitalHR</a> agency analyzed the most frequent questions that applicants ask about future employers, and made a list of the most important topics that the company should open, attracting employees.  This checklist is more suitable for companies interested in building a long-term HR brand, and not in a one-time search for specialists.  Nevertheless, the advice will be useful to everyone, and even with short-term goals will help increase the flow of people who want to have an interview. <br><br>  The compiled checklist should also help companies posting their vacancies on My Circle to correctly fill out their profile and use it as efficiently as possible.  From the company profile on My Circle you can find out about its activities, size, see the office photo, and also view all open or archive vacancies.  This is a useful and effective tool for HR-positioning of the company, but not everyone uses it correctly. <br><br>  For example, if you are a well-known offline company that has begun to actively develop the development department, it is better to focus in the description on the IT department, its success and team: even if the company has a rich history, but it is offline, it does not carry much value for the developer .  There are also many young projects in the IT field that the market does not yet know about.  Your chance to express yourself is to correctly fill out the organization‚Äôs profile on My Circle.

Brief description of the company </h2><br>  A brief description of the company, or specialization of the company, is used to display a summary of the company on the list of companies or on the job page. <br><br>  We have found many companies that do not fill out this form at all.  And in vain, do not disregard it.  It is like an advertisement that should catch the candidate who just glanced at him.  Do not approach the filling formally and at the same time try to very briefly and concisely tell about the essence of your activity.  Such options as ‚Äúsoftware development‚Äù, or ‚Äúinternational company‚Äù, or ‚Äúonline service‚Äù - none of them demonstrate your specificity and do not catch the candidate. <br><br>  But on the contrary, a couple of successful examples. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/705/463/f14/705463f14f78454da2e7b86413c6223f.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fa5/b8b/aee/fa5b8baeebc640f5aa94d0e85dd58596.png"><br><br><h2>  2. Company history </h2><br>  For some, the history of the company is to write the words "have been working since 2005".  Sometimes this is really enough.  But often candidates are interested in why the founders decided to open a company, where they took money for their business, at what point in their path the company is now, in their opinion.  After all, almost everyone wants to understand how big things are born from a simple idea or a case, who is at the helm, what their company means to them, where they are going to take it further. <br><br>  Here are some good examples. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b9d/3a1/211/b9d3a1211cf24c51b8c12accedf5f2f4.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ceb/904/b9b/ceb904b9bf6d49c184426dec18f8ea90.jpg"><br><br><h2>  3. Company development plans </h2><br>  A variant like ‚Äúwe are so cool, we need more people‚Äù is not suitable, because it is important for candidates to know what kind of common cause they will be involved in, what their work will be devoted to, which takes up most of their lives, what global goal their efforts will be aimed at . <br><br>  Tell us what the company or project is focusing its main focus on: entering a foreign market, restarting an application or opening a new service.  What are the ambitious challenges and challenges facing the company, what is its mission. <br><br>  Of course, developers are primarily looking for a vacancy where they can work with the technologies they are interested in.  But it is always more pleasant to work in a project that knows what it wants, than with a company that, a couple of times a year, changes the scope of its activities without achieving any result. <br><br>  Good examples. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0e1/f9c/96d/0e1f9c96d26749ee8eb9df556bed86a1.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b0d/249/970/b0d24997011544fcbd4e26709cc81a52.png"><br><br><h2>  4. Project team </h2><br>  Some projects indicate the average age of employees, someone writes from which companies they crawl developers, someone gives links to articles with the biography of the founders.  All this is not what future employees want to know, and it also does not help the companies themselves to find those who are well integrated into their team. <br><br>  Companies rarely need ‚Äújust great developers‚Äù.  In 90% of cases, the founders and their team are looking for like-minded people.  It is psychologically more comfortable to work side by side with people who share similar values.  For example, the founder of a startup is fighting for work life balance, which means he will look for people with the same convictions, and then start the working day with yoga with the team.  Therefore, in the description of the company, take a bit of space to tell who will have to work with, how the team spends their free time, what are the common hobbies. <br><br>  For example. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/55d/f22/d41/55df22d4111a44f79f62dbcfe15983d4.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/033/673/2bd/0336732bdfcb4982bb1b74a3ccbc2a78.png"><br><br><h2>  5. Personal development </h2><br>  It is important to show how the future employee can develop professionally and personally in his company.  Tell us how the company encourages the development of new technologies for their further implementation, what educational programs will be available at the company's expense, what assistance the company will be able to provide to an employee in developing their own project. <br><br>  Be sure to tell us what products the company is currently developing.  And is it possible to switch between them if the developer suddenly gets bored with working on one.  Sometimes it turns out that the online service for the sale of vouchers is developing mobile applications for customers - the candidate must understand where he can redirect his efforts within the company, if anything happens. <br><br>  For example. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/16b/02f/a77/16b02fa77d564869841d15415a4155fd.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e35/422/878/e35422878ddc431eb29b2e4cac07a9f1.png"><br><br><h2>  6. Working conditions </h2><br>  Candidates need to know that the company will take care of them.  The developers say that this can be seen from the way food is organized (delivery, your cafe or just fruit on Thursdays), how the office is planned, how the team spends time together.  Just "cookies" all have long become boring.  Here you can use photos of the office, ‚ÄúMy Circle‚Äù allows you to do this once or twice.  Developers love with their eyes: both a beautiful code and a convenient office.  If you can not boast of an office, fill in the pictures of the team with corporate parties, joint trips - the happy faces of the team will say a lot :) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c0f/165/571/c0f165571a7544fd9b64deecfb55b874.png"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/314152/">https://habr.com/ru/post/314152/</a></p>
