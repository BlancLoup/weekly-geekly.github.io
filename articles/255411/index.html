  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Overview of wireless Wi-Fi camera Oco for office and home</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  When it comes to cameras for remote monitoring of a home or office, the name Dropcam instantly pops up in the West: for this niche device, Dropcam means about the same thing as the iPhone for the smartphone market.  Easy to use, compact, relatively budget and stylish - in general, a universal camera for those who need to keep an eye on a small room.  After the success of Dropcam in some countries, she had start-ups competing, but practically no one was worthy of them.  All rivals either fell through the crowdfunding platforms immediately, or found a large investor and fell to the bottom after entering the market. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0a0/173/20b/0a017320b7904733aab243872eceb576.jpg"><br><br>  Introduced in early 2015, the <a href="http://madrobots.ru/p/umnaya-kamera-oco/">Oco camera</a> is one of the few real opponents of Dropcam.  Device trumps - phenomenal ease of setup and specific purpose.  Oco has four users: tracking everything that happens at home (in the apartment), watching a small business, monitoring children and taking pictures of pets around the clock (if you are away and missing). <a name="habracut"></a>

      To start working with the camera, you do not need anything except a box with a fully equipped Oco.  The stand bracket, which turns 360 degrees, the network adapter with the power cable, the camera itself ‚Äî unpacking takes a minute, setting is almost the same.  The smart camera seems rather large, but its size is not critical: the gadget can hardly fit into the interior.  But the plus of Oco‚Äôs dimensions is obvious: when entering the room, people will know that they are probably recorded. <br><br>  Connecting the camera to a smartphone takes place in three steps.  First you need to download the Ivideon application from the App Store or Google Play, then enter the password for the Wi-Fi point, and then show the generated QR code to the camera.  The broadcast on the smartphone screen will start in a few seconds.  If your primary phone is running on Windows Phone or is completely devoid of an operating system, you can connect to Oco from a computer: you need to open the Ivideon website and go through authorization. <br><br>  The internal memory of the gadget from Ivideon is missing: all video is immediately transferred to the cloud.  There are no free tariffs - for 0 cents, you can only view the broadcast in real time.  The list of tariffs looks like this: <br><br><ul><li>  4 dollars per month for each camera.  The ability to export up to an hour of video, distribute access to four users and save video in the cloud throughout the day. </li><li>  10 dollars a month.  Export two hours of video, eight users, seven days of video in the cloud. </li><li>  20 dollars a month.  Export four hours of video, give access to sixteen users, 30-day storage in the Ivideon cloud. </li></ul><br>  The optimal tariff can be immediately added to the cost of the Oco Camera - 10 thousand rubles in Russia, $ 150 in the USA. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d36/566/5b4/d365665b4b574177b09c8bdddde2798a.PNG"><br>  <i>So Oco sees our new office.</i> <br><br>  Video is recorded in a slightly outdated HD format, but an image with 720p quality is quite acceptable: the colors are natural, there is almost no noise, and the only drawback is minimal distortion along the edges of the frames (associated with a 120-degree lens).  At night, the sharpness also fails, but automatic switching to black and white mode sometimes occurs spontaneously. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f65/d90/b62/f65d90b620c14177bee0b7705b9593c6.png"><br><br>  All the reason - too sensitive sensor, which is able to confuse evening and night.  Fortunately for users, in the settings there are both additional modes off and camera adjustment taking into account the fact that there are pets in the room.  If we continue to talk about the disadvantages, then they should be attributed to too bright indicators that are next to the lens: I want to believe that the function of turning off the light bulbs will appear in the Ivideon application update. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7ba/19b/91a/7ba19b91abd4464fbca641fcb9b0fad8.png"><br><br>  One of the undoubted advantages of Oco Camera is the proper use of an audio chip.  It works not only as a sound sensor, which is responsible for security, but also as a normal microphone: if you wish, Oco can be used as a webcam for a conference with those who wait for you at home.  In the process of testing the sound, no slowdowns and freezes were noticed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b74/ff9/b5d/b74ff9b5deb54f8fa146504622a682b6.jpg"><br><br>  The conclusion is quite obvious: Oco Camera is a niche, but suitable device for those who need a reliable security camera.  Taking into account the price, functionality and flexibility of settings, this camera reserves a place in the top of its category.  You can purchase the device in the online store Madrobots.ru, where the Oco Camera is sold for 9,990 rubles. <br><br> <a href="https://twitter.com/MadrobotsRu"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ac1/fc6/d2a/ac1fc6d2a19948c59791b0da6ab659df.gif"></a> <a href="http://vk.com/madrobots"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/933/ac3/0b6/933ac30b6fd24ffd82218148c2fb0917.gif"></a> <a href="http://instagram.com/madrobotsru"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/464/a82/e04/464a82e045a34bae81406fd0b640cf08.gif"></a> <a href="http://facebook.com/madrobotsrussia"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0b5/542/136/0b55421365064901acdf0ed58cc4a111.gif"></a> <br> <a href="http://madrobots.ru/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/63d/405/78e/63d40578ecbf48f28c62f57705c73eb6.gif"></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/255411/">https://habr.com/ru/post/255411/</a></p>
