Virtually the only alternative was to use the chanforss driver from Netfors (although their free version is not perfect, but it allows you to build at least some working system).  <b>And finally, in Asterisk v13 +, there is support for SS7, which allows you to connect to real equipment.</b>  So, we will consider the sequence of steps necessary for assembling Asterisk, supporting work with digital communication channels. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <u><b>Connection planning</b></u>

      We need to decide whether we will have a connection to a higher-level telecom operator (uplinks), or whether we will deal exclusively with the maintenance of our downlinks.  Both the settings of the data link layer (from whom and in what order the physical flows will be synchronized), and the network layer parameters (see below) will depend on this. <br><br>  In our example, we will use the following source data: <br>  - two 4-port interface boards Digium TE 420; <br>  - on the first board, 4 ports are controlled by the OKS-7 signaling and collected in one bundle (linkset).  Connection parameters: "point-to-point", our pointcode 650, pointcode neighbor 599, it is also the end point.  This is an uplink connection, i.e., we will receive physical synchronization from it. <br>  - on the second board, a consumer working via the EuroISDN protocol is connected to the first port, to which we give 30 connecting lines (that is, we will use all the timeslots in E1).  For this consumer, we are a network (NET). <br>  - on the second board, another consumer is connected to the second port, but also operating under the EuroISDN protocol.  But we give him only 10 connecting lines (10 junior timeslots in E1. The remaining timeslots in the stream, with the exception of the signal, are not involved). <br>  - the remaining two ports of the second board are not used yet. <br><br>  <u><b>Installing Interface Cards</b></u> <br><br>  I use Digium interface cards for 1 (TE 131 *), 2 (TE 235 *), and 4 (TE 420 *) channels.  Now on sale there are also 8-channel boards, but somehow they didn‚Äôt get their hands on testing their performance. <br>  Before installing the boards, you must: <br><br>  - set with jumpers the required interface type (T1 or E1) for each of the ports on the board; <br>  - set the switch that identifies the serial number of the board in the system (when installing multiple boards, the values ‚Äã‚Äãset on the switches must be unique for each card); <br>  - when installing several cards into the system, it is also recommended to connect them with a special loop that will provide uniform synchronization for all ports (although in reality I did not notice any malfunctions in the absence of this loop even when sending faxes between ports located on different boards). <br>  For details on the installation process, see the original Digium datasheet. <br><br>  <u><b>Build kernel-level drivers and related utilities</b></u> <br><br>  Since we have installed additional interface hardware, its support will require kernel-level drivers, which are absent in standard linux distributions.  Therefore, we will have to compile them ourselves, and for this we will need the linux kernel source.  If you use the source code of exactly the version of the kernel that is installed on the system, then we will not need to build and install the kernel itself.  If the version does not match, then it will be necessary to first build a new kernel, and only after that, assemble dahdi drivers. <br><br>  So, download asterisk from the official site and unpack the latest version of dahdi drivers.  By the way, you can immediately download both the libpri and libss7 libraries, which will be needed to build chan_dahdi.  The tools package for working with dahdi has two useful utilities that may not be built by default.  These are dahdi_tool (allows you to view the status of the E1 physical ports in the console mode) and dahdi_pcap (allows you to save traffic passing through the E1 port for further analysis using wireshark).  Building a dahdi_tool requires the package newt-devel in the system, and dahdi_pcap requires libpcap-devel. <br><br>  For the dahdi_pcap utility to work, it is required to edit the file before the assembly <br><br>  dahdi-linux-complete / linux / include / dahdi / dahdi_config.h, in which you need to add a line <br><br>  #define CONFIG_DAHDI_MIRROR <br><br>  Next, proceed to the assembly and installation of the actual drivers: <br><br>  cd dahdi-linux-complete <br>  make clean <br>  make <br>  sudo -u root make install <br><br>  The dahdi_pcap utility is not built by the standard assembly system anyway, therefore we assemble it manually: <br><br>  cd dahdi-linux-complete / tools <br>  make dahdi_pcap <br><br>  After that, manually copy the executable file dahdi_pcap in the right place for us. <br><br>  <u><b>Creating a kernel-level driver configuration</b></u> <br><br>  Now we are going to configure the physical layer drivers.  All configuration files are located in the / etc / dahdi directory.  We are interested in / etc / dahdi / modules (list of loadable modules) and /etc/dahdi/system.conf (data link configuration for all physical ports). <br>  / Etc / dahdi / modules in each line is written the name of the module that is to be loaded.  If you are not sure which specific module supports the equipment used, you can run the dahdi_genconf utility, which will check the installed equipment and create the appropriate configuration file.  And you can make a universal configuration by simply listing in / etc / dahdi / modules all the modules that were assembled in the previous step (i.e. * .ko files from the dahdi-linux-complete / linux / drivers / dahdi directory, but without the path and .ko extensions). <br>  In my case (using Digium TE420 *, TE235 * and TE131 * boards), it is enough to specify only one wct4xxp module in / etc / dahdi / modules. <br><br>  The configuration of the data link layer for each of the ports used (span), as mentioned above, is located in the /etc/dahdi/system.conf file. <br><br>  Suppose we use one 4-port board to connect to the upstream telecom operator on OKS-7 (there are 4 full E1 physical streams in the bundle, each of which has signal timeslot), and one 2-port fee to connect to us downlinks on EuroISDN.  In this case, we take the physical synchronization from our higher-level operator (the order of choice of ports is consistent with it), and for our downlinks we ourselves act as the source of the clock signal.  At the same time, one of our downlinks uses all 30 timeslots (full E1), and the second we give only 10 first timeslots. <br><br>  For connection via the SS-7 protocol, the configuration example is as follows: <br><br>  # CARD 0, SPAN 2 <br>  span = 1,1,0, ccs, hdb3, yellow <br>  bchan = 1-15,17-31 <br>  mtp2 = 16 <br><br>  # CARD 0, SPAN 2 <br>  span = 2,2,0, ccs, hdb3, yellow <br>  bchan = 32-46,48-62 <br>  mtp2 = 47 <br><br>  # CARD 0, SPAN 3 <br>  span = 3,3,0, ccs, hdb3, yellow <br>  bchan = 63-77,79-93 <br>  mtp2 = 78 <br><br>  # CARD 0, SPAN 4 <br>  span = 4,4,0, ccs, hdb3, yellow <br>  bchan = 94-108,110-124 <br>  mtp2 = 109 <br><br>  # CARD 1, SPAN 1 Customer channel, timing master (ie far end is a slave) <br>  span = 5,0,0, ccs, hdb3, crc4, yellow <br>  bchan = 125-139,141-155 <br>  dchan = 140 <br><br>  # CARD 1, SPAN 2 Customer channel, timing master (ie far end is a slave) <br>  span = 6,0,0, ccs, hdb3, crc4, yellow <br>  # But the client uses only 10 timeslots <br>  bchan = 156-165 <br>  unused = 166-170,172-186 <br>  dchan = 171 <br><br>  # The remaining 2 ports on the second map are not used, so it is not necessary to describe them. <br><br>  <b>Notes:</b> <br><br>  In the span parameter, the first argument is the port number (for their location on the interface card, see the datasheet).  The boards themselves are arranged in a logical order corresponding to the value of the switches in ascending order of the value set for them). <br><br>  The second argument is the value that determines the physical sync.  A value of 0 indicates that we are the source of the clock signal for the remote side.  Non-zero values ‚Äã‚Äãset the priority of our synchronization from external sources (the smaller the value, the more priority the source of the external clock signal will be for us). <br><br>  The third parameter indicates the value depending on the length of the cable connecting our and remote systems.  The correspondence of the parameter value to the physical length is described in the comments in the system.conf. <br><br>  The next parameter indicates the type of frames.  For E1 with signaling ACS-7 or EuroISDN this will be ccs.  The following is the data encoding method.  For E1 with signaling ACS-7 or EuroISDN it will be hdb3. <br><br>  The next parameter (possibly) will be crc4, which allows the integrity control of the received data.  In any case, this value should coincide with what the distant party expects of us. <br><br>  The last parameter I set is yellow.  This causes the driver to transmit the ‚Äúyellow alarm‚Äù status when the corresponding span is not open by the application program (for example, Asterisk is not yet started or it was forcibly stopped). <br><br>  After the port is announced (span), the channels it contains are defined.  In our case, the channels will be of 3 types: signal (HDLC), voice (usually used to transmit a signal encoded by one of the G.711 variants. However, for 3GPP, these channels may contain unrestricted raw 64K data, and the channel‚Äôs operating mode changes the program depends on the requests in the signaling channel) and not used (if the stream has a smaller number of channels than the available number of timeslots). <br><br>  For the announcement of the signal link for OKS-7, we use the parameter mtp2 = channel, and for EuroISDN this parameter has the name dchan = channel.  In fact, both of these values ‚Äã‚Äãare equivalent and define the specified channel as an HDLC channel. <br><br>  Voice channels are announced with the help of the parameter bchan = channel (s), and not used channels are announced with the help of the parameter unused = channel (s). <br><br>  After the configuration is complete, load the driver with the command <br>  /etc/init.d/dahdi start and make sure that it works with the dahdi_tool utility: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/511/ca1/377/511ca1377fdd450b8951622be77c3217.jpg"><br><br>  The picture shows that all 4 ports on the first interface board and the first 2 ports on the second interface board are physically connected and synchronized with the remote side (i.e., the data link layer is raised on them).  The remaining 2 ports on the second board have the status ‚ÄúRed alarm‚Äù indicating that they are not physically connected to or is not operational (link level error). <br><br>  You can also view the status of a specific physical port. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4c9/14f/cb7/4c914fcb78f042aab0d6241f1d790203.jpg"><br><br>  ... and check the responsiveness of the system as a whole with the dahdi_test utility: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/970/d97/87a/970d9787a8dd41679b9ebc7408a072a1.jpg"><br><br>  Note that the greater the value of "Average:", the more responsive the system.  If this value is less than 99.99%, then, most likely, there will be problems with the transmission of facsimile data via digital channels.  Sound distortion is also possible when using the audio conferencing functionality. <br><br>  If, when trying to start dahdi_tool, we get a message like ‚ÄúUnable to open / dev / dahdi / ctl: No such file or directory‚Äù, this means that the drivers are not loaded or configured incorrectly.  You can check their load with the standard lsmod utility: <br><br>  #lsmod <br>  Module Size Used by Tainted: G <br>  wctc4xxp 32992 0 <br>  dahdi_transcode 4566 1 wctc4xxp <br>  wct4xxp 241730 166 <br>  dahdi 201849 486 dahdi_transcode, wct4xxp <br><br>  You can check the availability and logical location of the equipment using the lspci command: <br><br>  #lspci -k <br>  00: 00.0 Class 0600: 8086: 0150 <br>  00: 02.0 Class 0300: 8086: 0162 <br>  00: 14.0 Class 0c03: 8086: 1e31 xhci_hcd <br>  00: 16.0 Class 0780: 8086: 1e3a <br>  00: 16.3 Class 0700: 8086: 1e3d serial <br>  00: 19.0 Class 0200: 8086: 1502 e1000e <br>  00: 1a.0 Class 0c03: 8086: 1e2d ehci-pci <br>  00: 1b.0 Class 0403: 8086: 1e20 snd_hda_intel <br>  00: 1c.0 Class 0604: 8086: 1e10 pcieport <br>  00: 1c.4 Class 0604: 8086: 1e18 pcieport <br>  00: 1c.6 Class 0604: 8086: 1e1c pcieport <br>  00: 1c.7 Class 0604: 8086: 1e1e pcieport <br>  00: 1d.0 Class 0c03: 8086: 1e26 ehci-pci <br>  00: 1e.0 Class 0604: 8086: 244e <br>  00: 1f.0 Class 0601: 8086: 1e53 <br>  00: 1f.2 Class 0106: 8086: 1e02 ahci <br>  00: 1f.3 Class 0c05: 8086: 1e22 <br>  02: 00.0 Class 0604: 104c: 8231 <br>  03: 08.0 Class 0780: d161: 1420 wct4xxp <br>  04: 00.0 Class 0604: 104c: 8231 <br>  05: 08.0 Class 0780: d161: 1420 wct4xxp <br>  06: 00.0 Class 0200: 8086: 10d3 e1000e <br><br>  (for Digium equipment, the d161 value will be the manufacturer‚Äôs code). <br><br>  <u><b>Build the required libraries for full-featured chan_dahdi</b></u> <br><br>  To support EuroISDN signaling, we need the libpri library, the source codes of which we downloaded earlier from asterisk.org.
