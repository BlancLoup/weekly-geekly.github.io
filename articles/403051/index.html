That driving a car is very easy and pleasant.  And at this very moment, when experience is still not enough, and self-confidence rolls over any non-standard situation can lead to an accident.  And if you add a little more alcohol to it, the consequences can be quite bad. </p><br><p>  What is it for me?  But to what.  If the driving experience everyone evaluates himself and this is a very subjective assessment, the level of alcohol in the blood can be measured.  Indicates the device is zero - you can go. <br>  Shows something else - walk. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a20/b96/f11/a20b96f1158546378cd4ea11777917a9.JPG" alt="image"></p><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2 id="alkotester-kak-upakovka">  Breathalyzer as packing </h2><br><p>  I do not like to describe the packaging.  Therefore, as briefly as possible - very, very presentable.  Gift to a friend, girlfriend - approx.  It is enough to tie a ribbon and a beautiful gift is ready. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/698/9b3/8fe/6989b38fe4a746d7b00ed9f7adf6eef9.JPG" alt="image"></p><br><p>  In the complete set - the instruction, from those useless, that a small print in all languages.  A small piece of paper indicating not to disturb the seller and the cover. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fd4/10e/857/fd410e857de542898d4108c0146af5ae.JPG" alt="image"></p><br><h2 id="razmery-alkotestera">  Dimensions of breathalyzer </h2><br><p>  In size, the <a href="https://dadget.ru/katalog/avto-moto-velo/alkotester-drinkmate-ios/%3Futm_referrer%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Darticle%26utm_term%3Dalkotester-drinkmate-ios%26utm_content%3Dalkotester-drinkmate-ios%26utm_campaign%3Dalkotester-drinkmate-ios_611">tester</a> is most similar to a standard finger-type battery (AA). </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4ae/727/bfd/4ae727bfde8c40f19a82da7c0bdea162.JPG" alt="image"></p><br><p>  For comparison, I took a picture of the breathalyzer with the hero of the previous review - <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/dadget/blog/270376/">power-flash multutule</a> .  (By the way, it is still alive and well, only the old-large ipad connector has lost relevance for me) </p><br><h2 id="alkotester--krupnym-planom">  Breathalyzer - closeup </h2><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f9c/3bd/6c4/f9c3bd6c43354de493af2584c8a58674.JPG" alt="image"></p><br><h2 id="ispolzovanie">  Using </h2><br><p>  The program is installed as standard and without incident.  At start-up - a standard notification about the inadmissibility of driving while intoxicated is displayed. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e28/049/32e/e2804932ef9c4cec910e94507832e375.PNG" alt="image"></p><br><p>  From small flaws - in some places of the program Russian inscriptions do not enter a bit. <br>  The program has the ability to set profiles.  You can specify your data so that the measurement history is saved with reference to the map and your photo at the time of measurement!  To measure the "degree" of friends - there is the possibility of a guest entrance. </p><br><h3 id="podrobnye-instrukcii">  Detailed instructions </h3><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/537/d09/846/537d098464664dacbc3065943725bbbf.PNG" alt="image"></p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bb4/b45/219/bb4b452197d2483ea441c3adc3c12fc0.PNG" alt="image"></p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ce8/bd7/0a7/ce8bd70a7e1c4253894750a4083a8105.PNG" alt="image"></p><br><p>  There is a short pause of 10 seconds before the actual measurement. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d4d/4f7/56f/d4d4f756f214483fba8e62aa6c23872b.PNG" alt="image"></p><br><p>  After the measurement, you can add a photo and an indication of the place to the result and share this data with your friends!  Interestingly, the creators of the program meant when they added the phrase ‚ÄúI just got 0.5 per mille and how many do you have?‚Äù Looks like a challenge to the competition - who will bother. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/452/ba2/edb/452ba2edbf0945c193d74379bf11cd03.PNG" alt="image"></p><br><h2 id="moi-vpechatleniya">  My impressions </h2><br><ul><li>  Breathalyzer - a convincing thing!  It helps very easily to convince a slightly drunk friend that he drank lightly.  The key word is easy.  People believe figures more willingly. </li><li>  Breathalyzer - I personally need it very rarely.  Perhaps, if I was a professional driver, or a big drinker, I would use the tester more often.  But it‚Äôs enough one time to lose rights. </li><li>  Breathalyzer - may not be with you when needed.  Although the tester and attached keychain, and it can be attached, for example, to the keys on the keychain.  I just put the tester in the car for now. </li><li>  Breathalyzer is a show.  At the corporate party or any other holiday there are always those who want to ‚Äúknow their dose‚Äù.  Why is it in such a formulation.  There is a small nuance - between the measurements, the tester should rest for a couple of minutes.  By the way, about the resource.  The documentation states that after 700 measurements, it remains operable. <br>  Unfortunately, I could not compare this tester with the standard.  But, interestingly, half an hour after a bottle of beer - measurements showed results from 0.3 to 0.7.  The numbers are very dependent on the person.  From the obvious - the fat drunk less.  Much weaker. </li></ul><br><h2 id="idiotentest">  Idiotesttest </h2><br><p>  I will finish the review with a story about one interesting test.  In Germany, in violation of the rules of traffic rules are discharged.  And the amount of the fine will not be very big, but "sobering."  If you re-violation - again fine.  After the third violation the fine will be indecently large and the rights will be taken away.  And at this very moment the most interesting will begin.  It is believed that if you were not affected by three penalties, then you are an idiot.  And you need to work with a psychologist and pass this very "idiotest". </p><br><p>  One of the questions in this test is simply amazing: </p><br><p>  "What will you do if at a party where you came by car, you will be offered a drink?" </p><br><p>  Answer options: </p><br><p>  a) refuse; <br>  b) drink and go home by taxi; <br>  c) drink and stay overnight with the owners. </p><br><p>  The correct answer is an option that you should have offered yourself: </p><br><p>  I will not go to people who can offer drinks to a man behind the wheel. </p><br><h2 id="vmesto-zaklyucheniya">  Instead of conclusion </h2><br><p>  Never drink at the wheel!
